{"text": "THE WILL TO BELIEVE.[1]\nIn the recently published Life by Leslie Stephen of his brother,\nFitz-James, there is an account of a school to which the latter went\nwhen he was a boy.  The teacher, a certain Mr. Guest, used to converse\nwith his pupils in this wise: \"Gurney, what is the difference between\njustification and sanctification?--Stephen, prove the omnipotence of\nGod!\" etc.  In the midst of our Harvard freethinking and indifference\nwe are prone to imagine that here at your good old orthodox College\nconversation continues to be somewhat upon this order; and to show you\nthat we at Harvard have not lost all interest in these vital subjects,\nI have brought with me to-night something like a sermon on\njustification by faith to read to you,--I mean an essay in\njustification _of_ faith, a defence of our right to adopt a believing\nattitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that our merely\nlogical {2} intellect may not have been coerced.  'The Will to\nBelieve,' accordingly, is the title of my paper.\nI have long defended to my own students the lawfulness of voluntarily\nadopted faith; but as soon as they have got well imbued with the\nlogical spirit, they have as a rule refused to admit my contention to\nbe lawful philosophically, even though in point of fact they were\npersonally all the time chock-full of some faith or other themselves.\nI am all the while, however, so profoundly convinced that my own\nposition is correct, that your invitation has seemed to me a good\noccasion to make my statements more clear.  Perhaps your minds will be\nmore open than those with which I have hitherto had to deal.  I will be\nas little technical as I can, though I must begin by setting up some\ntechnical distinctions that will help us in the end.\nI.\nLet us give the name of _hypothesis_ to anything that may be proposed\nto our belief; and just as the electricians speak of live and dead\nwires, let us speak of any hypothesis as either _live_ or _dead_.  A\nlive hypothesis is one which appeals as a real possibility to him to\nwhom it is proposed.  If I ask you to believe in the Mahdi, the notion\nmakes no electric connection with your nature,--it refuses to\nscintillate with any credibility at all.  As an hypothesis it is\ncompletely dead.  To an Arab, however (even if he be not one of the\nMahdi's followers), the hypothesis is among the mind's possibilities:\nit is alive.  This shows that deadness and liveness in an hypothesis\nare not intrinsic properties, but relations to the {3} individual\nthinker.  They are measured by his willingness to act.  The maximum of\nliveness in an hypothesis means willingness to act irrevocably.\nPractically, that means belief; but there is some believing tendency\nwherever there is willingness to act at all.\nNext, let us call the decision between two hypotheses an _option_.\nOptions may be of several kinds.  They may be--1, _living_ or _dead_;\n2, _forced_ or _avoidable_; 3, _momentous_ or _trivial_; and for our\npurposes we may call an option a _genuine_ option when it is of the\nforced, living, and momentous kind.\n1.  A living option is one in which both hypotheses are live ones.  If\nI say to you: \"Be a theosophist or be a Mohammedan,\" it is probably a\ndead option, because for you neither hypothesis is likely to be alive.\nBut if I say: \"Be an agnostic or be a Christian,\" it is otherwise:\ntrained as you are, each hypothesis makes some appeal, however small,\nto your belief.\n2.  Next, if I say to you: \"Choose between going out with your umbrella\nor without it,\" I do not offer you a genuine option, for it is not\nforced.  You can easily avoid it by not going out at all.  Similarly,\nif I say, \"Either love me or hate me,\" \"Either call my theory true or\ncall it false,\" your option is avoidable.  You may remain indifferent\nto me, neither loving nor hating, and you may decline to offer any\njudgment as to my theory.  But if I say, \"Either accept this truth or\ngo without it,\" I put on you a forced option, for there is no standing\nplace outside of the alternative.  Every dilemma based on a complete\nlogical disjunction, with no possibility of not choosing, is an option\nof this forced kind.\n{4}\n3.  Finally, if I were Dr. Nansen and proposed to you to join my North\nPole expedition, your option would be momentous; for this would\nprobably be your only similar opportunity, and your choice now would\neither exclude you from the North Pole sort of immortality altogether\nor put at least the chance of it into your hands.  He who refuses to\nembrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried\nand failed.  _Per contra_, the option is trivial when the opportunity\nis not unique, when the stake is insignificant, or when the decision is\nreversible if it later prove unwise.  Such trivial options abound in\nthe scientific life.  A chemist finds an hypothesis live enough to\nspend a year in its verification: he believes in it to that extent.\nBut if his experiments prove inconclusive either way, he is quit for\nhis loss of time, no vital harm being done.\nIt will facilitate our discussion if we keep all these distinctions\nwell in mind.\nII.\nThe next matter to consider is the actual psychology of human opinion.\nWhen we look at certain facts, it seems as if our passional and\nvolitional nature lay at the root of all our convictions.  When we look\nat others, it seems as if they could do nothing when the intellect had\nonce said its say.  Let us take the latter facts up first.\nDoes it not seem preposterous on the very face of it to talk of our\nopinions being modifiable at will?  Can our will either help or hinder\nour intellect in its perceptions of truth?  Can we, by just willing it,\nbelieve that Abraham Lincoln's existence is a myth, {5} and that the\nportraits of him in McClure's Magazine are all of some one else?  Can\nwe, by any effort of our will, or by any strength of wish that it were\ntrue, believe ourselves well and about when we are roaring with\nrheumatism in bed, or feel certain that the sum of the two one-dollar\nbills in our pocket must be a hundred dollars?  We can say any of these\nthings, but we are absolutely impotent to believe them; and of just\nsuch things is the whole fabric of the truths that we do believe in\nmade up,--matters of fact, immediate or remote, as Hume said, and\nrelations between ideas, which are either there or not there for us if\nwe see them so, and which if not there cannot be put there by any\naction of our own.\nIn Pascal's Thoughts there is a celebrated passage known in literature\nas Pascal's wager.  In it he tries to force us into Christianity by\nreasoning as if our concern with truth resembled our concern with the\nstakes in a game of chance.  Translated freely his words are these: You\nmust either believe or not believe that God is--which will you do?\nYour human reason cannot say.  A game is going on between you and the\nnature of things which at the day of judgment will bring out either\nheads or tails.  Weigh what your gains and your losses would be if you\nshould stake all you have on heads, or God's existence: if you win in\nsuch case, you gain eternal beatitude; if you lose, you lose nothing at\nall.  If there were an infinity of chances, and only one for God in\nthis wager, still you ought to stake your all on God; for though you\nsurely risk a finite loss by this procedure, any finite loss is\nreasonable, even a certain one is reasonable, if there is but the\npossibility of {6} infinite gain.  Go, then, and take holy water, and\nhave masses said; belief will come and stupefy your scruples,--_Cela\nvous fera croire et vous ab\u00eatira_.  Why should you not?  At bottom,\nwhat have you to lose?\nYou probably feel that when religious faith expresses itself thus, in\nthe language of the gaming-table, it is put to its last trumps.  Surely\nPascal's own personal belief in masses and holy water had far other\nsprings; and this celebrated page of his is but an argument for others,\na last desperate snatch at a weapon against the hardness of the\nunbelieving heart.  We feel that a faith in masses and holy water\nadopted wilfully after such a mechanical calculation would lack the\ninner soul of faith's reality; and if we were ourselves in the place of\nthe Deity, we should probably take particular pleasure in cutting off\nbelievers of this pattern from their infinite reward.  It is evident\nthat unless there be some pre-existing tendency to believe in masses\nand holy water, the option offered to the will by Pascal is not a\nliving option.  Certainly no Turk ever took to masses and holy water on\nits account; and even to us Protestants these means of salvation seem\nsuch foregone impossibilities that Pascal's logic, invoked for them\nspecifically, leaves us unmoved.  As well might the Mahdi write to us,\nsaying, \"I am the Expected One whom God has created in his effulgence.\nYou shall be infinitely happy if you confess me; otherwise you shall be\ncut off from the light of the sun.  Weigh, then, your infinite gain if\nI am genuine against your finite sacrifice if I am not!\"  His logic\nwould be that of Pascal; but he would vainly use it on us, for the\nhypothesis he offers us is dead.  No tendency to act on it exists in us\nto any degree.\n{7}\nThe talk of believing by our volition seems, then, from one point of\nview, simply silly.  From another point of view it is worse than silly,\nit is vile.  When one turns to the magnificent edifice of the physical\nsciences, and sees how it was reared; what thousands of disinterested\nmoral lives of men lie buried in its mere foundations; what patience\nand postponement, what choking down of preference, what submission to\nthe icy laws of outer fact are wrought into its very stones and mortar;\nhow absolutely impersonal it stands in its vast augustness,--then how\nbesotted and contemptible seems every little sentimentalist who comes\nblowing his voluntary smoke-wreaths, and pretending to decide things\nfrom out of his private dream!  Can we wonder if those bred in the\nrugged and manly school of science should feel like spewing such\nsubjectivism out of their mouths?  The whole system of loyalties which\ngrow up in the schools of science go dead against its toleration; so\nthat it is only natural that those who have caught the scientific fever\nshould pass over to the opposite extreme, and write sometimes as if the\nincorruptibly truthful intellect ought positively to prefer bitterness\nand unacceptableness to the heart in its cup.\nIt fortifies my soul to know\nThat, though I perish, Truth is so--\nsings Clough, while Huxley exclaims: \"My only consolation lies in the\nreflection that, however bad our posterity may become, so far as they\nhold by the plain rule of not pretending to believe what they have no\nreason to believe, because it may be to their advantage so to pretend\n[the word 'pretend' is surely here redundant], they will not have\nreached the {8} lowest depth of immorality.\"  And that delicious\n_enfant terrible_ Clifford writes; \"Belief is desecrated when given to\nunproved and unquestioned statements for the solace and private\npleasure of the believer,...  Whoso would deserve well of his fellows\nin this matter will guard the purity of his belief with a very\nfanaticism of jealous care, lest at any time it should rest on an\nunworthy object, and catch a stain which can never be wiped away....\nIf [a] belief has been accepted on insufficient evidence [even though\nthe belief be true, as Clifford on the same page explains] the pleasure\nis a stolen one....  It is sinful because it is stolen in defiance of\nour duty to mankind.  That duty is to guard ourselves from such beliefs\nas from a pestilence which may shortly master our own body and then\nspread to the rest of the town....  It is wrong always, everywhere, and\nfor every one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.\"\nIII.\nAll this strikes one as healthy, even when expressed, as by Clifford,\nwith somewhat too much of robustious pathos in the voice.  Free-will\nand simple wishing do seem, in the matter of our credences, to be only\nfifth wheels to the coach.  Yet if any one should thereupon assume that\nintellectual insight is what remains after wish and will and\nsentimental preference have taken wing, or that pure reason is what\nthen settles our opinions, he would fly quite as directly in the teeth\nof the facts.\nIt is only our already dead hypotheses that our willing nature is\nunable to bring to life again  But what has made them dead for us is\nfor the most part {9} a previous action of our willing nature of an\nantagonistic kind.  When I say 'willing nature,' I do not mean only\nsuch deliberate volitions as may have set up habits of belief that we\ncannot now escape from,--I mean all such factors of belief as fear and\nhope, prejudice and passion, imitation and partisanship, the\ncircumpressure of our caste and set.  As a matter of fact we find\nourselves believing, we hardly know how or why.  Mr. Balfour gives the\nname of 'authority' to all those influences, born of the intellectual\nclimate, that make hypotheses possible or impossible for us, alive or\ndead.  Here in this room, we all of us believe in molecules and the\nconservation of energy, in democracy and necessary progress, in\nProtestant Christianity and the duty of fighting for 'the doctrine of\nthe immortal Monroe,' all for no reasons worthy of the name.  We see\ninto these matters with no more inner clearness, and probably with much\nless, than any disbeliever in them might possess.  His\nunconventionality would probably have some grounds to show for its\nconclusions; but for us, not insight, but the _prestige_ of the\nopinions, is what makes the spark shoot from them and light up our\nsleeping magazines of faith.  Our reason is quite satisfied, in nine\nhundred and ninety-nine cases out of every thousand of us, if it can\nfind a few arguments that will do to recite in case our credulity is\ncriticised by some one else.  Our faith is faith in some one else's\nfaith, and in the greatest matters this is most the case.  Our belief\nin truth itself, for instance, that there is a truth, and that our\nminds and it are made for each other,--what is it but a passionate\naffirmation of desire, in which our social system backs us up?  We want\nto have a truth; we want to believe that our {10} experiments and\nstudies and discussions must put us in a continually better and better\nposition towards it; and on this line we agree to fight out our\nthinking lives.  But if a pyrrhonistic sceptic asks us _how we know_\nall this, can our logic find a reply?  No! certainly it cannot.  It is\njust one volition against another,--we willing to go in for life upon a\ntrust or assumption which he, for his part, does not care to make.[2]\nAs a rule we disbelieve all facts and theories for which we have no\nuse.  Clifford's cosmic emotions find no use for Christian feelings.\nHuxley belabors the bishops because there is no use for sacerdotalism\nin his scheme of life.  Newman, on the contrary, goes over to Romanism,\nand finds all sorts of reasons good for staying there, because a\npriestly system is for him an organic need and delight.  Why do so few\n'scientists' even look at the evidence for telepathy, so called?\nBecause they think, as a leading biologist, now dead, once said to me,\nthat even if such a thing were true, scientists ought to band together\nto keep it suppressed and concealed.  It would undo the uniformity of\nNature and all sorts of other things without which scientists cannot\ncarry on their pursuits.  But if this very man had been shown something\nwhich as a scientist he might _do_ with telepathy, he might not only\nhave examined the evidence, but even have found it good enough.  This\nvery law which the logicians would impose upon us--if I may give the\nname of logicians to those who would rule out our willing nature\nhere--is based on nothing but their own natural wish to exclude all\nelements for {11} which they, in their professional quality of\nlogicians, can find no use.\nEvidently, then, our non-intellectual nature does influence our\nconvictions.  There are passional tendencies and volitions which run\nbefore and others which come after belief, and it is only the latter\nthat are too late for the fair; and they are not too late when the\nprevious passional work has been already in their own direction.\nPascal's argument, instead of being powerless, then seems a regular\nclincher, and is the last stroke needed to make our faith in masses and\nholy water complete.  The state of things is evidently far from simple;\nand pure insight and logic, whatever they might do ideally, are not the\nonly things that really do produce our creeds.\nIV.\nOur next duty, having recognized this mixed-up state of affairs, is to\nask whether it be simply reprehensible and pathological, or whether, on\nthe contrary, we must treat it as a normal element in making up our\nminds.  The thesis I defend is, briefly stated, this:  _Our passional\nnature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between\npropositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature\nbe decided on intellectual grounds; for to say, under such\ncircumstances, \"Do not decide, but leave the question open,\" is itself\na passional decision,--just like deciding yes or no,--and is attended\nwith the same risk of losing the truth_.  The thesis thus abstractly\nexpressed will, I trust, soon become quite clear.  But I must first\nindulge in a bit more of preliminary work.\n{12}\nV.\nIt will be observed that for the purposes of this discussion we are on\n'dogmatic' ground,--ground, I mean, which leaves systematic\nphilosophical scepticism altogether out of account.  The postulate that\nthere is truth, and that it is the destiny of our minds to attain it,\nwe are deliberately resolving to make, though the sceptic will not make\nit.  We part company with him, therefore, absolutely, at this point.\nBut the faith that truth exists, and that our minds can find it, may be\nheld in two ways.  We may talk of the _empiricist_ way and of the\n_absolutist_ way of believing in truth.  The absolutists in this matter\nsay that we not only can attain to knowing truth, but we can _know\nwhen_ we have attained to knowing it; while the empiricists think that\nalthough we may attain it, we cannot infallibly know when.  To _know_\nis one thing, and to know for certain _that_ we know is another.  One\nmay hold to the first being possible without the second; hence the\nempiricists and the absolutists, although neither of them is a sceptic\nin the usual philosophic sense of the term, show very different degrees\nof dogmatism in their lives.\nIf we look at the history of opinions, we see that the empiricist\ntendency has largely prevailed in science, while in philosophy the\nabsolutist tendency has had everything its own way.  The characteristic\nsort of happiness, indeed, which philosophies yield has mainly\nconsisted in the conviction felt by each successive school or system\nthat by it bottom-certitude had been attained.  \"Other philosophies are\ncollections of opinions, mostly false; _my_ philosophy {13} gives\nstanding-ground forever,\"--who does not recognize in this the key-note\nof every system worthy of the name?  A system, to be a system at all,\nmust come as a _closed_ system, reversible in this or that detail,\nperchance, but in its essential features never!\nScholastic orthodoxy, to which one must always go when one wishes to\nfind perfectly clear statement, has beautifully elaborated this\nabsolutist conviction in a doctrine which it calls that of 'objective\nevidence.'  If, for example, I am unable to doubt that I now exist\nbefore you, that two is less than three, or that if all men are mortal\nthen I am mortal too, it is because these things illumine my intellect\nirresistibly.  The final ground of this objective evidence possessed by\ncertain propositions is the _adaequatio intellect\u00fbs nostri cum r\u00ea_.\nThe certitude it brings involves an _aptitudinem ad extorquendum certum\nassensum_ on the part of the truth envisaged, and on the side of the\nsubject a _quietem in cognitione_, when once the object is mentally\nreceived, that leaves no possibility of doubt behind; and in the whole\ntransaction nothing operates but the _entitas ipsa_ of the object and\nthe _entitas ipsa_ of the mind.  We slouchy modern thinkers dislike to\ntalk in Latin,--indeed, we dislike to talk in set terms at all; but at\nbottom our own state of mind is very much like this whenever we\nuncritically abandon ourselves: You believe in objective evidence, and\nI do.  Of some things we feel that we are certain: we know, and we know\nthat we do know.  There is something that gives a click inside of us, a\nbell that strikes twelve, when the hands of our mental clock have swept\nthe dial and meet over the meridian hour.  The greatest empiricists\namong us are only empiricists on reflection: when {14} left to their\ninstincts, they dogmatize like infallible popes.  When the Cliffords\ntell us how sinful it is to be Christians on such 'insufficient\nevidence,' insufficiency is really the last thing they have in mind.\nFor them the evidence is absolutely sufficient, only it makes the other\nway.  They believe so completely in an anti-christian order of the\nuniverse that there is no living option: Christianity is a dead\nhypothesis from the start.\nVI.\nBut now, since we are all such absolutists by instinct, what in our\nquality of students of philosophy ought we to do about the fact?  Shall\nwe espouse and indorse it?  Or shall we treat it as a weakness of our\nnature from which we must free ourselves, if we can?\nI sincerely believe that the latter course is the only one we can\nfollow as reflective men.  Objective evidence and certitude are\ndoubtless very fine ideals to play with, but where on this moonlit and\ndream-visited planet are they found?  I am, therefore, myself a\ncomplete empiricist so far as my theory of human knowledge goes.  I\nlive, to be sure, by the practical faith that we must go on\nexperiencing and thinking over our experience, for only thus can our\nopinions grow more true; but to hold any one of them--I absolutely do\nnot care which--as if it never could be reinterpretable or corrigible,\nI believe to be a tremendously mistaken attitude, and I think that the\nwhole history of philosophy will bear me out.  There is but one\nindefectibly certain truth, and that is the truth that pyrrhonistic\nscepticism itself leaves {15} standing,--the truth that the present\nphenomenon of consciousness exists.  That, however, is the bare\nstarting-point of knowledge, the mere admission of a stuff to be\nphilosophized about.  The various philosophies are but so many attempts\nat expressing what this stuff really is.  And if we repair to our\nlibraries what disagreement do we discover!  Where is a certainly true\nanswer found?  Apart from abstract propositions of comparison (such as\ntwo and two are the same as four), propositions which tell us nothing\nby themselves about concrete reality, we find no proposition ever\nregarded by any one as evidently certain that has not either been\ncalled a falsehood, or at least had its truth sincerely questioned by\nsome one else.  The transcending of the axioms of geometry, not in play\nbut in earnest, by certain of our contemporaries (as Z\u00f6llner and\nCharles H. Hinton), and the rejection of the whole Aristotelian logic\nby the Hegelians, are striking instances in point.\nNo concrete test of what is really true has ever been agreed upon.\nSome make the criterion external to the moment of perception, putting\nit either in revelation, the _consensus gentium_, the instincts of the\nheart, or the systematized experience of the race.  Others make the\nperceptive moment its own test,--Descartes, for instance, with his\nclear and distinct ideas guaranteed by the veracity of God; Reid with\nhis 'common-sense;' and Kant with his forms of synthetic judgment _a\npriori_.  The inconceivability of the opposite; the capacity to be\nverified by sense; the possession of complete organic unity or\nself-relation, realized when a thing is its own other,--are standards\nwhich, in turn, have been used.  The much {16} lauded objective\nevidence is never triumphantly there, it is a mere aspiration or\n_Grenzbegriff_, marking the infinitely remote ideal of our thinking\nlife.  To claim that certain truths now possess it, is simply to say\nthat when you think them true and they _are_ true, then their evidence\nis objective, otherwise it is not.  But practically one's conviction\nthat the evidence one goes by is of the real objective brand, is only\none more subjective opinion added to the lot.  For what a contradictory\narray of opinions have objective evidence and absolute certitude been\nclaimed!  The world is rational through and through,--its existence is\nan ultimate brute fact; there is a personal God,--a personal God is\ninconceivable; there is an extra-mental physical world immediately\nknown,--the mind can only know its own ideas; a moral imperative\nexists,--obligation is only the resultant of desires; a permanent\nspiritual principle is in every one,--there are only shifting states of\nmind; there is an endless chain of causes,--there is an absolute first\ncause; an eternal necessity,--a freedom; a purpose,--no purpose; a\nprimal One,--a primal Many; a universal continuity,--an essential\ndiscontinuity in things; an infinity,--no infinity.  There is\nthis,--there is that; there is indeed nothing which some one has not\nthought absolutely true, while his neighbor deemed it absolutely false;\nand not an absolutist among them seems ever to have considered that the\ntrouble may all the time be essential, and that the intellect, even\nwith truth directly in its grasp, may have no infallible signal for\nknowing whether it be truth or no.  When, indeed, one remembers that\nthe most striking practical application to life of the doctrine of\nobjective certitude has been {17} the conscientious labors of the Holy\nOffice of the Inquisition, one feels less tempted than ever to lend the\ndoctrine a respectful ear.\nBut please observe, now, that when as empiricists we give up the\ndoctrine of objective certitude, we do not thereby give up the quest or\nhope of truth itself.  We still pin our faith on its existence, and\nstill believe that we gain an ever better position towards it by\nsystematically continuing to roll up experiences and think.  Our great\ndifference from the scholastic lies in the way we face.  The strength\nof his system lies in the principles, the origin, the _terminus a quo_\nof his thought; for us the strength is in the outcome, the upshot, the\n_terminus ad quem_.  Not where it comes from but what it leads to is to\ndecide.  It matters not to an empiricist from what quarter an\nhypothesis may come to him: he may have acquired it by fair means or by\nfoul; passion may have whispered or accident suggested it; but if the\ntotal drift of thinking continues to confirm it, that is what he means\nby its being true.\nVII.\nOne more point, small but important, and our preliminaries are done.\nThere are two ways of looking at our duty in the matter of\nopinion,--ways entirely different, and yet ways about whose difference\nthe theory of knowledge seems hitherto to have shown very little\nconcern.  _We must know the truth_; and _we must avoid error_,--these\nare our first and great commandments as would-be knowers; but they are\nnot two ways of stating an identical commandment, they are two\nseparable laws.  Although it may indeed happen that when we believe the\ntruth _A_, we escape {18} as an incidental consequence from believing\nthe falsehood _B_, it hardly ever happens that by merely disbelieving\n_B_ we necessarily believe _A_.  We may in escaping _B_ fall into\nbelieving other falsehoods, _C_ or _D_, just as bad as _B_; or we may\nescape _B_ by not believing anything at all, not even _A_.\nBelieve truth!  Shun error!--these, we see, are two materially\ndifferent laws; and by choosing between them we may end by coloring\ndifferently our whole intellectual life.  We may regard the chase for\ntruth as paramount, and the avoidance of error as secondary; or we may,\non the other hand, treat the avoidance of error as more imperative, and\nlet truth take its chance.  Clifford, in the instructive passage which\nI have quoted, exhorts us to the latter course.  Believe nothing, he\ntells us, keep your mind in suspense forever, rather than by closing it\non insufficient evidence incur the awful risk of believing lies.  You,\non the other hand, may think that the risk of being in error is a very\nsmall matter when compared with the blessings of real knowledge, and be\nready to be duped many times in your investigation rather than postpone\nindefinitely the chance of guessing true.  I myself find it impossible\nto go with Clifford.  We must remember that these feelings of our duty\nabout either truth or error are in any case only expressions of our\npassional life.  Biologically considered, our minds are as ready to\ngrind out falsehood as veracity, and he who says, \"Better go without\nbelief forever than believe a lie!\" merely shows his own preponderant\nprivate horror of becoming a dupe.  He may be critical of many of his\ndesires and fears, but this fear he slavishly obeys.  He cannot imagine\nany one questioning its binding force.  For my own part, I {19} have\nalso a horror of being duped; but I can believe that worse things than\nbeing duped may happen to a man in this world: so Clifford's\nexhortation has to my ears a thoroughly fantastic sound.  It is like a\ngeneral informing his soldiers that it is better to keep out of battle\nforever than to risk a single wound.  Not so are victories either over\nenemies or over nature gained.  Our errors are surely not such awfully\nsolemn things.  In a world where we are so certain to incur them in\nspite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier\nthan this excessive nervousness on their behalf.  At any rate, it seems\nthe fittest thing for the empiricist philosopher.\nVIII.\nAnd now, after all this introduction, let us go straight at our\nquestion.  I have said, and now repeat it, that not only as a matter of\nfact do we find our passional nature influencing us in our opinions,\nbut that there are some options between opinions in which this\ninfluence must be regarded both as an inevitable and as a lawful\ndeterminant of our choice.\nI fear here that some of you my hearers will begin to scent danger, and\nlend an inhospitable ear.  Two first steps of passion you have indeed\nhad to admit as necessary,--we must think so as to avoid dupery, and we\nmust think so as to gain truth; but the surest path to those ideal\nconsummations, you will probably consider, is from now onwards to take\nno further passional step.\nWell, of course, I agree as far as the facts will allow.  Wherever the\noption between losing truth and gaining it is not momentous, we can\nthrow the {20} chance of _gaining truth_ away, and at any rate save\nourselves from any chance of _believing falsehood_, by not making up\nour minds at all till objective evidence has come.  In scientific\nquestions, this is almost always the case; and even in human affairs in\ngeneral, the need of acting is seldom so urgent that a false belief to\nact on is better than no belief at all.  Law courts, indeed, have to\ndecide on the best evidence attainable for the moment, because a\njudge's duty is to make law as well as to ascertain it, and (as a\nlearned judge once said to me) few cases are worth spending much time\nover: the great thing is to have them decided on _any_ acceptable\nprinciple, and got out of the way.  But in our dealings with objective\nnature we obviously are recorders, not makers, of the truth; and\ndecisions for the mere sake of deciding promptly and getting on to the\nnext business would be wholly out of place.  Throughout the breadth of\nphysical nature facts are what they are quite independently of us, and\nseldom is there any such hurry about them that the risks of being duped\nby believing a premature theory need be faced.  The questions here are\nalways trivial options, the hypotheses are hardly living (at any rate\nnot living for us spectators), the choice between believing truth or\nfalsehood is seldom forced.  The attitude of sceptical balance is\ntherefore the absolutely wise one if we would escape mistakes.  What\ndifference, indeed, does it make to most of us whether we have or have\nnot a theory of the R\u00f6ntgen rays, whether we believe or not in\nmind-stuff, or have a conviction about the causality of conscious\nstates?  It makes no difference.  Such options are not forced on us.\nOn every account it is better not to make them, but still keep weighing\nreasons _pro et contra_ with an indifferent hand.\n{21}\nI speak, of course, here of the purely judging mind.  For purposes of\ndiscovery such indifference is to be less highly recommended, and\nscience would be far less advanced than she is if the passionate\ndesires of individuals to get their own faiths confirmed had been kept\nout of the game.  See for example the sagacity which Spencer and\nWeismann now display.  On the other hand, if you want an absolute\nduffer in an investigation, you must, after all, take the man who has\nno interest whatever in its results: he is the warranted incapable, the\npositive fool.  The most useful investigator, because the most\nsensitive observer, is always he whose eager interest in one side of\nthe question is balanced by an equally keen nervousness lest he become\ndeceived.[3]  Science has organized this nervousness into a regular\n_technique_, her so-called method of verification; and she has fallen\nso deeply in love with the method that one may even say she has ceased\nto care for truth by itself at all.  It is only truth as technically\nverified that interests her.  The truth of truths might come in merely\naffirmative form, and she would decline to touch it.  Such truth as\nthat, she might repeat with Clifford, would be stolen in defiance of\nher duty to mankind.  Human passions, however, are stronger than\ntechnical rules.  \"Le coeur a ses raisons,\" as Pascal says, \"que la\nraison ne conna\u00eet pas;\" and however indifferent to all but the bare\nrules of the game the umpire, the abstract intellect, may be, the\nconcrete players who furnish him the materials to judge of are usually,\neach one of them, in love with some pet 'live hypothesis' of his own.\nLet us agree, however, that wherever there is no forced option, the\n{22} dispassionately judicial intellect with no pet hypothesis, saving\nus, as it does, from dupery at any rate, ought to be our ideal.\nThe question next arises: Are there not somewhere forced options in our\nspeculative questions, and can we (as men who may be interested at\nleast as much in positively gaining truth as in merely escaping dupery)\nalways wait with impunity till the coercive evidence shall have\narrived?  It seems _a priori_ improbable that the truth should be so\nnicely adjusted to our needs and powers as that.  In the great\nboarding-house of nature, the cakes and the butter and the syrup seldom\ncome out so even and leave the plates so clean.  Indeed, we should view\nthem with scientific suspicion if they did.\nIX.\n_Moral questions_ immediately present themselves as questions whose\nsolution cannot wait for sensible proof.  A moral question is a\nquestion not of what sensibly exists, but of what is good, or would be\ngood if it did exist.  Science can tell us what exists; but to compare\nthe _worths_, both of what exists and of what does not exist, we must\nconsult not science, but what Pascal calls our heart.  Science herself\nconsults her heart when she lays it down that the infinite\nascertainment of fact and correction of false belief are the supreme\ngoods for man.  Challenge the statement, and science can only repeat it\noracularly, or else prove it by showing that such ascertainment and\ncorrection bring man all sorts of other goods which man's heart in turn\ndeclares.  The question of having moral beliefs at all or not having\nthem is decided by {23} our will.  Are our moral preferences true or\nfalse, or are they only odd biological phenomena, making things good or\nbad for _us_, but in themselves indifferent?  How can your pure\nintellect decide?  If your heart does not _want_ a world of moral\nreality, your head will assuredly never make you believe in one.\nMephistophelian scepticism, indeed, will satisfy the head's\nplay-instincts much better than any rigorous idealism can.  Some men\n(even at the student age) are so naturally cool-hearted that the\nmoralistic hypothesis never has for them any pungent life, and in their\nsupercilious presence the hot young moralist always feels strangely ill\nat ease.  The appearance of knowingness is on their side, of na\u00efvet\u00e9\nand gullibility on his.  Yet, in the inarticulate heart of him, he\nclings to it that he is not a dupe, and that there is a realm in which\n(as Emerson says) all their wit and intellectual superiority is no\nbetter than the cunning of a fox.  Moral scepticism can no more be\nrefuted or proved by logic than intellectual scepticism can.  When we\nstick to it that there _is_ truth (be it of either kind), we do so with\nour whole nature, and resolve to stand or fall by the results.  The\nsceptic with his whole nature adopts the doubting attitude; but which\nof us is the wiser, Omniscience only knows.\nTurn now from these wide questions of good to a certain class of\nquestions of fact, questions concerning personal relations, states of\nmind between one man and another.  _Do you like me or not?_--for\nexample.  Whether you do or not depends, in countless instances, on\nwhether I meet you half-way, am willing to assume that you must like\nme, and show you trust and expectation.  The previous faith on my part\nin your liking's existence is in such cases what makes {24} your liking\ncome.  But if I stand aloof, and refuse to budge an inch until I have\nobjective evidence, until you shall have done something apt, as the\nabsolutists say, _ad extorquendum assensum meum_, ten to one your\nliking never comes.  How many women's hearts are vanquished by the mere\nsanguine insistence of some man that they _must_ love him! he will not\nconsent to the hypothesis that they cannot.  The desire for a certain\nkind of truth here brings about that special truth's existence; and so\nit is in innumerable cases of other sorts.  Who gains promotions,\nboons, appointments, but the man in whose life they are seen to play\nthe part of live hypotheses, who discounts them, sacrifices other\nthings for their sake before they have come, and takes risks for them\nin advance?  His faith acts on the powers above him as a claim, and\ncreates its own verification.\nA social organism of any sort whatever, large or small, is what it is\nbecause each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the\nother members will simultaneously do theirs.  Wherever a desired result\nis achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons, its\nexistence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in\none another of those immediately concerned.  A government, an army, a\ncommercial system, a ship, a college, an athletic team, all exist on\nthis condition, without which not only is nothing achieved, but nothing\nis even attempted.  A whole train of passengers (individually brave\nenough) will be looted by a few highwaymen, simply because the latter\ncan count on one another, while each passenger fears that if he makes a\nmovement of resistance, he will be shot before any one else backs him\nup.  If we believed that the whole car-full would rise {25} at once\nwith us, we should each severally rise, and train-robbing would never\neven be attempted.  There are, then, cases where a fact cannot come at\nall unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming.  _And where faith\nin a fact can help create the fact_, that would be an insane logic\nwhich should say that faith running ahead of scientific evidence is the\n'lowest kind of immorality' into which a thinking being can fall.  Yet\nsuch is the logic by which our scientific absolutists pretend to\nregulate our lives!\nX.\nIn truths dependent on our personal action, then, faith based on desire\nis certainly a lawful and possibly an indispensable thing.\nBut now, it will be said, these are all childish human cases, and have\nnothing to do with great cosmical matters, like the question of\nreligious faith.  Let us then pass on to that.  Religions differ so\nmuch in their accidents that in discussing the religious question we\nmust make it very generic and broad.  What then do we now mean by the\nreligious hypothesis?  Science says things are; morality says some\nthings are better than other things; and religion says essentially two\nthings.\nFirst, she says that the best things are the more eternal things, the\noverlapping things, the things in the universe that throw the last\nstone, so to speak, and say the final word.  \"Perfection is\neternal,\"--this phrase of Charles Secr\u00e9tan seems a good way of putting\nthis first affirmation of religion, an affirmation which obviously\ncannot yet be verified scientifically at all.\n{26}\nThe second affirmation of religion is that we are better off even now\nif we believe her first affirmation to be true.\nNow, let us consider what the logical elements of this situation are\n_in case the religious hypothesis in both its branches be really true_.\n(Of course, we must admit that possibility at the outset.  If we are to\ndiscuss the question at all, it must involve a living option.  If for\nany of you religion be a hypothesis that cannot, by any living\npossibility be true, then you need go no farther.  I speak to the\n'saving remnant' alone.)  So proceeding, we see, first, that religion\noffers itself as a _momentous_ option.  We are supposed to gain, even\nnow, by our belief, and to lose by our non-belief, a certain vital\ngood.  Secondly, religion is a _forced_ option, so far as that good\ngoes.  We cannot escape the issue by remaining sceptical and waiting\nfor more light, because, although we do avoid error in that way _if\nreligion be untrue_, we lose the good, _if it be true_, just as\ncertainly as if we positively chose to disbelieve.  It is as if a man\nshould hesitate indefinitely to ask a certain woman to marry him\nbecause he was not perfectly sure that she would prove an angel after\nhe brought her home.  Would he not cut himself off from that particular\nangel-possibility as decisively as if he went and married some one\nelse?  Scepticism, then, is not avoidance of option; it is option of a\ncertain particular kind of risk.  _Better risk loss of truth than\nchance of error_,--that is your faith-vetoer's exact position.  He is\nactively playing his stake as much as the believer is; he is backing\nthe field against the religious hypothesis, just as the believer is\nbacking the religious hypothesis against the field.  To preach\nscepticism to us as a duty until {27} 'sufficient evidence' for\nreligion be found, is tantamount therefore to telling us, when in\npresence of the religious hypothesis, that to yield to our fear of its\nbeing error is wiser and better than to yield to our hope that it may\nbe true.  It is not intellect against all passions, then; it is only\nintellect with one passion laying down its law.  And by what, forsooth,\nis the supreme wisdom of this passion warranted?  Dupery for dupery,\nwhat proof is there that dupery through hope is so much worse than\ndupery through fear?  I, for one, can see no proof; and I simply refuse\nobedience to the scientist's command to imitate his kind of option, in\na case where my own stake is important enough to give me the right to\nchoose my own form of risk.  If religion be true and the evidence for\nit be still insufficient, I do not wish, by putting your extinguisher\nupon my nature (which feels to me as if it had after all some business\nin this matter), to forfeit my sole chance in life of getting upon the\nwinning side,--that chance depending, of course, on my willingness to\nrun the risk of acting as if my passional need of taking the world\nreligiously might be prophetic and right.\nAll this is on the supposition that it really may be prophetic and\nright, and that, even to us who are discussing the matter, religion is\na live hypothesis which may be true.  Now, to most of us religion comes\nin a still further way that makes a veto on our active faith even more\nillogical.  The more perfect and more eternal aspect of the universe is\nrepresented in our religions as having personal form.  The universe is\nno longer a mere _It_ to us, but a _Thou_, if we are religious; and any\nrelation that may be possible from person to person might be possible\n{28} here.  For instance, although in one sense we are passive portions\nof the universe, in another we show a curious autonomy, as if we were\nsmall active centres on our own account.  We feel, too, as if the\nappeal of religion to us were made to our own active good-will, as if\nevidence might be forever withheld from us unless we met the hypothesis\nhalf-way.  To take a trivial illustration: just as a man who in a\ncompany of gentlemen made no advances, asked a warrant for every\nconcession, and believed no one's word without proof, would cut himself\noff by such churlishness from all the social rewards that a more\ntrusting spirit would earn,--so here, one who should shut himself up in\nsnarling logicality and try to make the gods extort his recognition\nwilly-nilly, or not get it at all, might cut himself off forever from\nhis only opportunity of making the gods' acquaintance.  This feeling,\nforced on us we know not whence, that by obstinately believing that\nthere are gods (although not to do so would be so easy both for our\nlogic and our life) we are doing the universe the deepest service we\ncan, seems part of the living essence of the religious hypothesis.  If\nthe hypothesis _were_ true in all its parts, including this one, then\npure intellectualism, with its veto on our making willing advances,\nwould be an absurdity; and some participation of our sympathetic nature\nwould be logically required.  I, therefore, for one cannot see my way\nto accepting the agnostic rules for truth-seeking, or wilfully agree to\nkeep my willing nature out of the game.  I cannot do so for this plain\nreason, that _a rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from\nacknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were\nreally there, would be an irrational rule_.  That for me {29} is the\nlong and short of the formal logic of the situation, no matter what the\nkinds of truth might materially be.\nI confess I do not see how this logic can be escaped.  But sad\nexperience makes me fear that some of you may still shrink from\nradically saying with me, _in abstracto_, that we have the right to\nbelieve at our own risk any hypothesis that is live enough to tempt our\nwill.  I suspect, however, that if this is so, it is because you have\ngot away from the abstract logical point of view altogether, and are\nthinking (perhaps without realizing it) of some particular religious\nhypothesis which for you is dead.  The freedom to 'believe what we\nwill' you apply to the case of some patent superstition; and the faith\nyou think of is the faith defined by the schoolboy when he said, \"Faith\nis when you believe something that you know ain't true.\"  I can only\nrepeat that this is misapprehension.  _In concreto_, the freedom to\nbelieve can only cover living options which the intellect of the\nindividual cannot by itself resolve; and living options never seem\nabsurdities to him who has them to consider.  When I look at the\nreligious question as it really puts itself to concrete men, and when I\nthink of all the possibilities which both practically and theoretically\nit involves, then this command that we shall put a stopper on our\nheart, instincts, and courage, and wait--acting of course meanwhile\nmore or less as if religion were _not_ true[4]--till {30} doomsday, or\ntill such time as our intellect and senses working together may have\nraked in evidence enough,--this command, I say, seems to me the\nqueerest idol ever manufactured in the philosophic cave.  Were we\nscholastic absolutists, there might be more excuse.  If we had an\ninfallible intellect with its objective certitudes, we might feel\nourselves disloyal to such a perfect organ of knowledge in not trusting\nto it exclusively, in not waiting for its releasing word.  But if we\nare empiricists, if we believe that no bell in us tolls to let us know\nfor certain when truth is in our grasp, then it seems a piece of idle\nfantasticality to preach so solemnly our duty of waiting for the bell.\nIndeed we _may_ wait if we will,--I hope you do not think that I am\ndenying that,--but if we do so, we do so at our peril as much as if we\nbelieved.  In either case we _act_, taking our life in our hands.  No\none of us ought to issue vetoes to the other, nor should we bandy words\nof abuse.  We ought, on the contrary, delicately and profoundly to\nrespect one another's mental freedom: then only shall we bring about\nthe intellectual republic; then only shall we have that spirit of inner\ntolerance without which all our outer tolerance is soulless, and which\nis empiricism's glory; then only shall we live and let live, in\nspeculative as well as in practical things.\nI began by a reference to Fitz James Stephen; let me end by a quotation\nfrom him.  \"What do you think {31} of yourself?  What do you think of\nthe world?...  These are questions with which all must deal as it seems\ngood to them.  They are riddles of the Sphinx, and in some way or other\nwe must deal with them....  In all important transactions of life we\nhave to take a leap in the dark....  If we decide to leave the riddles\nunanswered, that is a choice; if we waver in our answer, that, too, is\na choice: but whatever choice we make, we make it at our peril.  If a\nman chooses to turn his back altogether on God and the future, no one\ncan prevent him; no one can show beyond reasonable doubt that he is\nmistaken.  If a man thinks otherwise and acts as he thinks, I do not\nsee that any one can prove that _he_ is mistaken.  Each must act as he\nthinks best; and if he is wrong, so much the worse for him.  We stand\non a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist,\nthrough which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be\ndeceptive.  If we stand still we shall be frozen to death.  If we take\nthe wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces.  We do not certainly know\nwhether there is any right one.  What must we do?  'Be strong and of a\ngood courage.'  Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what\ncomes....  If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.\"[5]\n[1] An Address to the Philosophical Clubs of Yale and Brown\nUniversities.  Published in the New World, June, 1896.\n[2] Compare the admirable page 310 in S. H. Hodgson's \"Time and Space,\"\nLondon, 1865.\n[3] Compare Wilfrid Ward's Essay, \"The Wish to Believe,\" in his\n_Witnesses to the Unseen_, Macmillan & Co., 1893.\n[4] Since belief is measured by action, he who forbids us to believe\nreligion to be true, necessarily also forbids us to act as we should if\nwe did believe it to be true.  The whole defence of religious faith\nhinges upon action.  If the action required or inspired by the\nreligious hypothesis is in no way different from that dictated by the\nnaturalistic hypothesis, then religious faith is a pure superfluity,\nbetter pruned away, and controversy about its legitimacy is a piece of\nidle trifling, unworthy of serious minds.  I myself believe, of course,\nthat the religious hypothesis gives to the world an expression which\nspecifically determines our reactions, and makes them in a large part\nunlike what they might be on a purely naturalistic scheme of belief.\n[5] Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, p. 353, 2d edition.  London, 1874.\n{32}\nIS LIFE WORTH LIVING?[1]\nWhen Mr. Mallock's book with this title appeared some fifteen years\nago, the jocose answer that \"it depends on the _liver_\" had great\ncurrency in the newspapers.  The answer which I propose to give\nto-night cannot be jocose.  In the words of one of Shakespeare's\nprologues,--\n\"I come no more to make you laugh; things now,\nThat bear a weighty and a serious brow,\nSad, high, and working, full of state and woe,\"--\nmust be my theme.  In the deepest heart of all of us there is a corner\nin which the ultimate mystery of things works sadly; and I know not\nwhat such an association as yours intends, nor what you ask of those\nwhom you invite to address you, unless it be to lead you from the\nsurface-glamour of existence, and for an hour at least to make you\nheedless to the buzzing and jigging and vibration of small interests\nand excitements that form the tissue of our ordinary consciousness.\nWithout further explanation or apology, then, I ask you to join me in\nturning an attention, commonly too unwilling, to the profounder\nbass-note of life.  Let us search the lonely depths for an hour\ntogether, and see what answers in the last folds and recesses of things\nour question may find.\n{33}\nI.\nWith many men the question of life's worth is answered by a\ntemperamental optimism which makes them incapable of believing that\nanything seriously evil can exist.  Our dear old Walt Whitman's works\nare the standing text-book of this kind of optimism.  The mere joy of\nliving is so immense in Walt Whitman's veins that it abolishes the\npossibility of any other kind of feeling:--\n\"To breathe the air, how delicious!\nTo speak, to walk, to seize something by the hand!...\nTo be this incredible God I am!...\nO amazement of things, even the least particle!\nO spirituality of things!\nI too carol the Sun, usher'd or at noon, or as now, setting;\nI too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the\ngrowths of the earth....\nI sing to the last the equalities, modern or old,\nI sing the endless finales of things,\nI say Nature continues--glory continues.\nI praise with electric voice,\nFor I do not see one imperfection in the universe,\nAnd I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last.\"\nSo Rousseau, writing of the nine years he spent at Annecy, with nothing\nbut his happiness to tell:--\n\"How tell what was neither said nor done nor even thought, but tasted\nonly and felt, with no object of my felicity but the emotion of\nfelicity itself!  I rose with the sun, and I was happy; I went to walk,\nand I was happy; I saw 'Maman,' and I was happy; I left her, and I was\nhappy.  I rambled through the woods and over the vine-slopes, I\nwandered in the valleys, I read, I lounged, I {34} worked in the\ngarden, I gathered the fruits, I helped at the indoor work, and\nhappiness followed me everywhere.  It was in no one assignable thing;\nit was all within myself; it could not leave me for a single instant.\"\nIf moods like this could be made permanent, and constitutions like\nthese universal, there would never be any occasion for such discourses\nas the present one.  No philosopher would seek to prove articulately\nthat life is worth living, for the fact that it absolutely is so would\nvouch for itself, and the problem disappear in the vanishing of the\nquestion rather than in the coming of anything like a reply.  But we\nare not magicians to make the optimistic temperament universal; and\nalongside of the deliverances of temperamental optimism concerning\nlife, those of temperamental pessimism always exist, and oppose to them\na standing refutation.  In what is called 'circular insanity,' phases\nof melancholy succeed phases of mania, with no outward cause that we\ncan discover; and often enough to one and the same well person life\nwill present incarnate radiance to-day and incarnate dreariness\nto-morrow, according to the fluctuations of what the older medical\nbooks used to call \"the concoction of the humors.\"  In the words of the\nnewspaper joke, \"it depends on the liver.\"  Rousseau's ill-balanced\nconstitution undergoes a change, and behold him in his latter evil days\na prey to melancholy and black delusions of suspicion and fear.  Some\nmen seem launched upon the world even from their birth with souls as\nincapable of happiness as Walt Whitman's was of gloom, and they have\nleft us their messages in even more lasting verse than his,--the\nexquisite Leopardi, for example; or our own contemporary, {35} James\nThomson, in that pathetic book, The City of Dreadful Night, which I\nthink is less well-known than it should be for its literary beauty,\nsimply because men are afraid to quote its words,--they are so gloomy,\nand at the same time so sincere.  In one place the poet describes a\ncongregation gathered to listen to a preacher in a great unillumined\ncathedral at night.  The sermon is too long to quote, but it ends\nthus:--\n\"'O Brothers of sad lives! they are so brief;\nA few short years must bring us all relief:\nCan we not bear these years of laboring breath.\nBut if you would not this poor life fulfil,\nLo, you are free to end it when you will,\nWithout the fear of waking after death.'--\n\"The organ-like vibrations of his voice\nThrilled through the vaulted aisles and died away;\nThe yearning of the tones which bade rejoice\nWas sad and tender as a requiem lay:\nOur shadowy congregation rested still,\nAs brooding on that 'End it when you will.'\n*    *    *    *    *\n\"Our shadowy congregation rested still,\nAs musing on that message we had heard,\nAnd brooding on that 'End it when you will,'\nPerchance awaiting yet some other word;\nWhen keen as lightning through a muffled sky\nSprang forth a shrill and lamentable cry;--\n\"'The man speaks sooth, alas! the man speaks sooth:\nWe have no personal life beyond the grave;\nThere is no God; Fate knows nor wrath nor ruth:\nCan I find here the comfort which I crave?\n\"'In all eternity I had one chance,\nOne few years' term of gracious human life,--\nThe splendors of the intellect's advance,\nThe sweetness of the home with babes and wife;\n{36}\n\"'The social pleasures with their genial wit;\nThe fascination of the worlds of art;\nThe glories of the worlds of Nature lit\nBy large imagination's glowing heart;\n\"'The rapture of mere being, full of health;\nThe careless childhood and the ardent youth;\nThe strenuous manhood winning various wealth,\nThe reverend age serene with life's long truth;\n\"'All the sublime prerogatives of Man;\nThe storied memories of the times of old,\nThe patient tracking of the world's great plan\nThrough sequences and changes myriadfold.\n\"'This chance was never offered me before;\nFor me the infinite past is blank and dumb;\nThis chance recurreth never, nevermore;\nBlank, blank for me the infinite To-come.\n\"'And this sole chance was frustrate from my birth,\nA mockery, a delusion; and my breath\nOf noble human life upon this earth\nSo racks me that I sigh for senseless death.\n\"'My wine of life is poison mixed with gall,\nMy noonday passes in a nightmare dream,\nI worse than lose the years which are my all:\nWhat can console me for the loss supreme?\n\"'Speak not of comfort where no comfort is,\nSpeak not at all: can words make foul things fair!\nOur life 's a cheat, our death a black abyss:\nHush, and be mute, envisaging despair.'\n\"This vehement voice came from the northern aisle,\nRapid and shrill to its abrupt harsh close;\nAnd none gave answer for a certain while,\nFor words must shrink from these most wordless woes;\nAt last the pulpit speaker simply said,\nWith humid eyes and thoughtful, drooping head,--\n{37}\n\"'My Brother, my poor Brothers, it is thus:\nThis life holds nothing good for us,\nBut it ends soon and nevermore can be;\nAnd we knew nothing of it ere our birth,\nAnd shall know nothing when consigned to earth;\nI ponder these thoughts, and they comfort me.'\"\n\"It ends soon, and never more can be,\" \"Lo, you are free to end it when\nyou will,\"--these verses flow truthfully from the melancholy Thomson's\npen, and are in truth a consolation for all to whom, as to him, the\nworld is far more like a steady den of fear than a continual fountain\nof delight.  That life is not worth living the whole army of suicides\ndeclare,--an army whose roll-call, like the famous evening gun of the\nBritish army, follows the sun round the world and never terminates.\nWe, too, as we sit here in our comfort, must 'ponder these things'\nalso, for we are of one substance with these suicides, and their life\nis the life we share.  The plainest intellectual integrity,--nay, more,\nthe simplest manliness and honor, forbid us to forget their case.\n\"If suddenly,\" says Mr. Ruskin, \"in the midst of the enjoyments of the\npalate and lightnesses of heart of a London dinner-party, the walls of\nthe chamber were parted, and through their gap the nearest human beings\nwho were famishing and in misery were borne into the midst of the\ncompany feasting and fancy free; if, pale from death, horrible in\ndestitution, broken by despair, body by body they were laid upon the\nsoft carpet, one beside the chair of every guest,--would only the\ncrumbs of the dainties be cast to them; would only a passing glance, a\npassing thought, be vouchsafed to them?  Yet the actual facts, the real\nrelation of each Dives and Lazarus, are not altered by the {38}\nintervention of the house-wall between the table and the sick-bed,--by\nthe few feet of ground (how few!) which are, indeed, all that separate\nthe merriment from the misery.\"\nII.\nTo come immediately to the heart of my theme, then, what I propose is\nto imagine ourselves reasoning with a fellow-mortal who is on such\nterms with life that the only comfort left him is to brood on the\nassurance, \"You may end it when you will.\"  What reasons can we plead\nthat may render such a brother (or sister) willing to take up the\nburden again?  Ordinary Christians, reasoning with would-be suicides,\nhave little to offer them beyond the usual negative, \"Thou shalt not.\"\nGod alone is master of life and death, they say, and it is a\nblasphemous act to anticipate his absolving hand.  But can _we_ find\nnothing richer or more positive than this, no reflections to urge\nwhereby the suicide may actually see, and in all sad seriousness feel,\nthat in spite of adverse appearances even for him life is still worth\nliving?  There are suicides and suicides (in the United States about\nthree thousand of them every year), and I must frankly confess that\nwith perhaps the majority of these my suggestions are impotent to deal.\nWhere suicide is the result of insanity or sudden frenzied impulse,\nreflection is impotent to arrest its headway; and cases like these\nbelong to the ultimate mystery of evil, concerning which I can only\noffer considerations tending toward religious patience at the end of\nthis hour.  My task, let me say now, is practically narrow, and my\nwords are to deal only with that metaphysical _tedium vitae_ which is\npeculiar to {39} reflecting men.  Most of you are devoted, for good or\nill, to the reflective life.  Many of you are students of philosophy,\nand have already felt in your own persons the scepticism and unreality\nthat too much grubbing in the abstract roots of things will breed.\nThis is, indeed, one of the regular fruits of the over-studious career.\nToo much questioning and too little active responsibility lead, almost\nas often as too much sensualism does, to the edge of the slope, at the\nbottom of which lie pessimism and the nightmare or suicidal view of\nlife.  But to the diseases which reflection breeds, still further\nreflection can oppose effective remedies; and it is of the melancholy\nand _Weltschmerz_ bred of reflection that I now proceed to speak.\nLet me say, immediately, that my final appeal is to nothing more\nrecondite than religious faith.  So far as my argument is to be\ndestructive, it will consist in nothing more than the sweeping away of\ncertain views that often keep the springs of religious faith\ncompressed; and so far as it is to be constructive, it will consist in\nholding up to the light of day certain considerations calculated to let\nloose these springs in a normal, natural way.  Pessimism is essentially\na religious disease.  In the form of it to which you are most liable,\nit consists in nothing but a religious demand to which there comes no\nnormal religious reply.\nNow, there are two stages of recovery from this disease, two different\nlevels upon which one may emerge from the midnight view to the daylight\nview of things, and I must treat of them in turn.  The second stage is\nthe more complete and joyous, and it corresponds to the freer exercise\nof religious {40} trust and fancy.  There are, as is well known,\npersons who are naturally very free in this regard, others who are not\nat all so.  There are persons, for instance, whom we find indulging to\ntheir heart's content in prospects of immortality; and there are others\nwho experience the greatest difficulty in making such a notion seem\nreal to themselves at all.  These latter persons are tied to their\nsenses, restricted to their natural experience; and many of them,\nmoreover, feel a sort of intellectual loyalty to what they call 'hard\nfacts,' which is positively shocked by the easy excursions into the\nunseen that other people make at the bare call of sentiment.  Minds of\neither class may, however, be intensely religious.  They may equally\ndesire atonement and reconciliation, and crave acquiescence and\ncommunion with the total soul of things.  But the craving, when the\nmind is pent in to the hard facts, especially as science now reveals\nthem, can breed pessimism, quite as easily as it breeds optimism when\nit inspires religious trust and fancy to wing their way to another and\na better world.\nThat is why I call pessimism an essentially religious disease.  The\nnightmare view of life has plenty of organic sources; but its great\nreflective source has at all times been the contradiction between the\nphenomena of nature and the craving of the heart to believe that behind\nnature there is a spirit whose expression nature is.  What philosophers\ncall 'natural theology' has been one way of appeasing this craving;\nthat poetry of nature in which our English literature is so rich has\nbeen another way.  Now, suppose a mind of the latter of our two\nclasses, whose imagination is pent in consequently, and who takes its\n{41} facts 'hard;' suppose it, moreover, to feel strongly the craving\nfor communion, and yet to realize how desperately difficult it is to\nconstrue the scientific order of nature either theologically or\npoetically,--and what result can there be but inner discord and\ncontradiction?  Now, this inner discord (merely as discord) can be\nrelieved in either of two ways: The longing to read the facts\nreligiously may cease, and leave the bare facts by themselves; or,\nsupplementary facts may be discovered or believed-in, which permit the\nreligious reading to go on.  These two ways of relief are the two\nstages of recovery, the two levels of escape from pessimism, to which I\nmade allusion a moment ago, and which the sequel will, I trust, make\nmore clear.\nIII.\nStarting then with nature, we naturally tend, if we have the religious\ncraving, to say with Marcus Aurelius, \"O Universe! what thou wishest I\nwish.\"  Our sacred books and traditions tell us of one God who made\nheaven and earth, and, looking on them, saw that they were good.  Yet,\non more intimate acquaintance, the visible surfaces of heaven and earth\nrefuse to be brought by us into any intelligible unity at all.  Every\nphenomenon that we would praise there exists cheek by jowl with some\ncontrary phenomenon that cancels all its religious effect upon the\nmind.  Beauty and hideousness, love and cruelty, life and death keep\nhouse together in indissoluble partnership; and there gradually steals\nover us, instead of the old warm notion of a man-loving Deity, that of\nan awful power that neither hates nor loves, but rolls all things {42}\ntogether meaninglessly to a common doom.  This is an uncanny, a\nsinister, a nightmare view of life, and its peculiar _unheimlichkeit_,\nor poisonousness, lies expressly in our holding two things together\nwhich cannot possibly agree,--in our clinging, on the one hand, to the\ndemand that there shall be a living spirit of the whole; and, on the\nother, to the belief that the course of nature must be such a spirit's\nadequate manifestation and expression.  It is in the contradiction\nbetween the supposed being of a spirit that encompasses and owns us,\nand with which we ought to have some communion, and the character of\nsuch a spirit as revealed by the visible world's course, that this\nparticular death-in-life paradox and this melancholy-breeding puzzle\nreside, Carlyle expresses the result in that chapter of his immortal\n'Sartor Resartus' entitled 'The Everlasting No.'  \"I lived,\" writes\npoor Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh, \"in a continual, indefinite, pining fear;\ntremulous, pusillanimous, apprehensive of I knew not what: it seemed as\nif all things in the heavens above and the earth beneath would hurt me;\nas if the heavens and the earth were but boundless jaws of a devouring\nmonster, wherein I, palpitating, lay waiting to be devoured.\"\nThis is the first stage of speculative melancholy.  No brute can have\nthis sort of melancholy; no man who is irreligious can become its prey.\nIt is the sick shudder of the frustrated religious demand, and not the\nmere necessary outcome of animal experience.  Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh himself\ncould have made shift to face the general chaos and bedevilment of this\nworld's experiences very well, were he not the victim of an originally\nunlimited trust and affection towards them.  If he might meet them\npiecemeal, with no suspicion {43} of any whole expressing itself in\nthem, shunning the bitter parts and husbanding the sweet ones, as the\noccasion served, and as the day was foul or fair, he could have\nzigzagged toward an easy end, and felt no obligation to make the air\nvocal with his lamentations.  The mood of levity, of 'I don't care,' is\nfor this world's ills a sovereign and practical anaesthetic.  But, no!\nsomething deep down in Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh and in the rest of us tells us\nthat there _is_ a Spirit in things to which we owe allegiance, and for\nwhose sake we must keep up the serious mood.  And so the inner fever\nand discord also are kept up; for nature taken on her visible surface\nreveals no such Spirit, and beyond the facts of nature we are at the\npresent stage of our inquiry not supposing ourselves to look.\nNow, I do not hesitate frankly and sincerely to confess to you that\nthis real and genuine discord seems to me to carry with it the\ninevitable bankruptcy of natural religion na\u00efvely and simply taken.\nThere were times when Leibnitzes with their heads buried in monstrous\nwigs could compose Theodicies, and when stall-fed officials of an\nestablished church could prove by the valves in the heart and the round\nligament of the hip-joint the existence of a \"Moral and Intelligent\nContriver of the World.\"  But those times are past; and we of the\nnineteenth century, with our evolutionary theories and our mechanical\nphilosophies, already know nature too impartially and too well to\nworship unreservedly any God of whose character she can be an adequate\nexpression.  Truly, all we know of good and duty proceeds from nature;\nbut none the less so all we know of evil.  Visible nature is all\nplasticity and indifference,--a moral multiverse, as one might call it,\nand not a moral {44} universe.  To such a harlot we owe no allegiance;\nwith her as a whole we can establish no moral communion; and we are\nfree in our dealings with her several parts to obey or destroy, and to\nfollow no law but that of prudence in coming to terms with such other\nparticular features as will help us to our private ends.  If there be a\ndivine Spirit of the universe, nature, such as we know her, cannot\npossibly be its _ultimate word_ to man.  Either there is no Spirit\nrevealed in nature, or else it is inadequately revealed there; and (as\nall the higher religions have assumed) what we call visible nature, or\n_this_ world, must be but a veil and surface-show whose full meaning\nresides in a supplementary unseen or _other_ world.\nI cannot help, therefore, accounting it on the whole a gain (though it\nmay seem for certain poetic constitutions a very sad loss) that the\nnaturalistic superstition, the worship of the God of nature, simply\ntaken as such, should have begun to loosen its hold upon the educated\nmind.  In fact, if I am to express my personal opinion unreservedly, I\nshould say (in spite of its sounding blasphemous at first to certain\nears) that the initial step towards getting into healthy ultimate\nrelations with the universe is the act of rebellion against the idea\nthat such a God exists.  Such rebellion essentially is that which in\nthe chapter I have quoted from Carlyle goes on to describe:--\n\"'Wherefore, like a coward, dost thou forever pip and whimper, and go\ncowering and trembling?  Despicable biped!...  Hast thou not a heart;\ncanst thou not suffer whatsoever it be; and, as a Child of Freedom,\nthough outcast, trample Tophet itself under thy feet, while it consumes\nthee?  Let it come, then, I will meet it and defy it!'  And as I so\nthought, there rushed like a stream of fire {45} over my whole soul;\nand I shook base Fear away from me forever....\n\"Thus had the Everlasting No pealed authoritatively through all the\nrecesses of my being, of my Me, and then was it that my whole Me stood\nup, in native God-created majesty, and recorded its Protest.  Such a\nProtest, the most important transaction in life, may that same\nIndignation and Defiance, in a psychological point of view, be fitly\ncalled.  The Everlasting No had said: 'Behold, thou art fatherless,\noutcast, and the Universe is mine;' to which my whole Me now made\nanswer: 'I am not thine, but Free, and forever hate thee!'  From that\nhour,\" Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh-Carlyle adds, \"I began to be a man.\"\nAnd our poor friend, James Thomson, similarly writes:--\n\"Who is most wretched in this dolorous place?\nI think myself, yet I would rather be\nMy miserable self than He, than He\nWho formed such creatures to his own disgrace.\nThe vilest thing must be less vile than Thou\nFrom whom it had its being, God and Lord!\nCreator of all woe and sin! abhorred,\nMalignant and implacable!  I vow\nThat not for all Thy power furled and unfurled,\nFor all the temples to Thy glory built,\nWould I assume the ignominious guilt\nOf having made such men in such a world.\"\nWe are familiar enough in this community with the spectacle of persons\nexulting in their emancipation from belief in the God of their\nancestral Calvinism,--him who made the garden and the serpent, and\npre-appointed the eternal fires of hell.  Some of them have found\nhumaner gods to worship, others are simply converts from all theology;\nbut, both alike, they {46} assure us that to have got rid of the\nsophistication of thinking they could feel any reverence or duty toward\nthat impossible idol gave a tremendous happiness to their souls.  Now,\nto make an idol of the spirit of nature, and worship it, also leads to\nsophistication; and in souls that are religious and would also be\nscientific the sophistication breeds a philosophical melancholy, from\nwhich the first natural step of escape is the denial of the idol; and\nwith the downfall of the idol, whatever lack of positive joyousness may\nremain, there comes also the downfall of the whimpering and cowering\nmood.  With evil simply taken as such, men can make short work, for\ntheir relations with it then are only practical.  It looms up no longer\nso spectrally, it loses all its haunting and perplexing significance,\nas soon as the mind attacks the instances of it singly, and ceases to\nworry about their derivation from the 'one and only Power.'\nHere, then, on this stage of mere emancipation from monistic\nsuperstition, the would-be suicide may already get encouraging answers\nto his question about the worth of life.  There are in most men\ninstinctive springs of vitality that respond healthily when the burden\nof metaphysical and infinite responsibility rolls off.  The certainty\nthat you now _may_ step out of life whenever you please, and that to do\nso is not blasphemous or monstrous, is itself an immense relief.  The\nthought of suicide is now no longer a guilty challenge and obsession.\n\"This little life is all we must endure;\nThe grave's most holy peace is ever sure,\"--\nsays Thomson; adding, \"I ponder these thoughts, and they comfort me.\"\nMeanwhile we can always {47} stand it for twenty-four hours longer, if\nonly to see what to-morrow's newspaper will contain, or what the next\npostman will bring.\nBut far deeper forces than this mere vital curiosity are arousable,\neven in the pessimistically-tending mind; for where the loving and\nadmiring impulses are dead, the hating and fighting impulses will still\nrespond to fit appeals.  This evil which we feel so deeply is something\nthat we can also help to overthrow; for its sources, now that no\n'Substance' or 'Spirit' is behind them, are finite, and we can deal\nwith each of them in turn.  It is, indeed, a remarkable fact that\nsufferings and hardships do not, as a rule, abate the love of life;\nthey seem, on the contrary, usually to give it a keener zest.  The\nsovereign source of melancholy is repletion.  Need and struggle are\nwhat excite and inspire us; our hour of triumph is what brings the\nvoid.  Not the Jews of the captivity, but those of the days of\nSolomon's glory are those from whom the pessimistic utterances in our\nBible come.  Germany, when she lay trampled beneath the hoofs of\nBonaparte's troopers, produced perhaps the most optimistic and\nidealistic literature that the world has seen; and not till the French\n'milliards' were distributed after 1871 did pessimism overrun the\ncountry in the shape in which we see it there to-day.  The history of\nour own race is one long commentary on the cheerfulness that comes with\nfighting ills.  Or take the Waldenses, of whom I lately have been\nreading, as examples of what strong men will endure.  In 1483 a papal\nbull of Innocent VIII. enjoined their extermination.  It absolved those\nwho should take up the crusade against them from all ecclesiastical\npains and penalties, released them from {48} any oath, legitimized\ntheir title to all property which they might have illegally acquired,\nand promised remission of sins to all who should kill the heretics.\n\"There is no town in Piedmont,\" says a Vaudois writer, \"where some of\nour brethren have not been put to death.  Jordan Terbano was burnt\nalive at Susa; Hippolite Rossiero at Turin, Michael Goneto, an\noctogenarian, at Sarcena; Vilermin Ambrosio hanged on the Col di Meano;\nHugo Chiambs, of Fenestrelle, had his entrails torn from his living\nbody at Turin; Peter Geymarali of Bobbio in like manner had his\nentrails taken out in Lucerna, and a fierce cat thrust in their place\nto torture him further; Maria Romano was buried alive at Rocca Patia;\nMagdalena Fauno underwent the same fate at San Giovanni; Susanna\nMichelini was bound hand and foot, and left to perish of cold and\nhunger on the snow at Sarcena; Bartolomeo Fache, gashed with sabres,\nhad the wounds filled up with quicklime, and perished thus in agony at\nPenile; Daniel Michelini had his tongue torn out at Bobbo for having\npraised God; James Baridari perished covered with sulphurous matches\nwhich had been forced into his flesh under the nails, between the\nfingers, in the nostrils, in the lips, and all over the body, and then\nlighted; Daniel Rovelli had his mouth filled with gunpowder, which,\nbeing lighted, blew his head to pieces;...  Sara Rostignol was slit\nopen from the legs to the bosom, and left so to perish on the road\nbetween Eyral and Lucerna; Anna Charbonnier was impaled, and carried\nthus on a pike from San Giovanni to La Torre.\"[2]\n_Und dergleicken mehr_!  In 1630 the plague swept away one-half of the\nVaudois population, including fifteen of their seventeen pastors.  The\nplaces of these were supplied from Geneva and Dauphiny, and {49} the\nwhole Vaudois people learned French in order to follow their services.\nMore than once their number fell, by unremitting persecution, from the\nnormal standard of twenty-five thousand to about four thousand.  In\n1686 the Duke of Savoy ordered the three thousand that remained to give\nup their faith or leave the country.  Refusing, they fought the French\nand Piedmontese armies till only eighty of their fighting men remained\nalive or uncaptured, when they gave up, and were sent in a body to\nSwitzerland.  But in 1689, encouraged by William of Orange and led by\none of their pastor-captains, between eight hundred and nine hundred of\nthem returned to conquer their old homes again.  They fought their way\nto Bobi, reduced to four hundred men in the first half year, and met\nevery force sent against them, until at last the Duke of Savoy, giving\nup his alliance with that abomination of desolation, Louis XIV.,\nrestored them to comparative freedom,--since which time they have\nincreased and multiplied in their barren Alpine valleys to this day.\nWhat are our woes and sufferance compared with these?  Does not the\nrecital of such a fight so obstinately waged against such odds fill us\nwith resolution against our petty powers of darkness,--machine\npoliticians, spoilsmen, and the rest?  Life is worth living, no matter\nwhat it bring, if only such combats may be carried to successful\nterminations and one's heel set on the tyrant's throat.  To the\nsuicide, then, in his supposed world of multifarious and immoral\nnature, you can appeal--and appeal in the name of the very evils that\nmake his heart sick there--to wait and see his part of the battle out.\nAnd the consent to live on, which you ask of him under these {50}\ncircumstances, is not the sophistical 'resignation' which devotees of\ncowering religions preach: it is not resignation in the sense of\nlicking a despotic Deity's hand.  It is, on the contrary, a resignation\nbased on manliness and pride.  So long as your would-be suicide leaves\nan evil of his own unremedied, so long he has strictly no concern with\nevil in the abstract and at large.  The submission which you demand of\nyourself to the general fact of evil in the world, your apparent\nacquiescence in it, is here nothing but the conviction that evil at\nlarge is _none of your business_ until your business with your private\nparticular evils is liquidated and settled up.  A challenge of this\nsort, with proper designation of detail, is one that need only be made\nto be accepted by men whose normal instincts are not decayed; and your\nreflective would-be suicide may easily be moved by it to face life with\na certain interest again.  The sentiment of honor is a very penetrating\nthing.  When you and I, for instance, realize how many innocent beasts\nhave had to suffer in cattle-cars and slaughter-pens and lay down their\nlives that we might grow up, all fattened and clad, to sit together\nhere in comfort and carry on this discourse, it does, indeed, put our\nrelation to the universe in a more solemn light.  \"Does not,\" as a\nyoung Amherst philosopher (Xenos Clark, now dead) once wrote, \"the\nacceptance of a happy life upon such terms involve a point of honor?\"\nAre we not bound to take some suffering upon ourselves, to do some\nself-denying service with our lives, in return for all those lives upon\nwhich ours are built?  To hear this question is to answer it in but one\npossible way, if one have a normally constituted heart.\n{51}\nThus, then, we see that mere instinctive curiosity, pugnacity, and\nhonor may make life on a purely naturalistic basis seem worth living\nfrom day to day to men who have cast away all metaphysics in order to\nget rid of hypochondria, but who are resolved to owe nothing as yet to\nreligion and its more positive gifts.  A poor half-way stage, some of\nyou may be inclined to say; but at least you must grant it to be an\nhonest stage; and no man should dare to speak meanly of these instincts\nwhich are our nature's best equipment, and to which religion herself\nmust in the last resort address her own peculiar appeals.\nIV.\nAnd now, in turning to what religion may have to say to the question, I\ncome to what is the soul of my discourse.  Religion has meant many\nthings in human history; but when from now onward I use the word I mean\nto use it in the supernaturalist sense, as declaring that the so-called\norder of nature, which constitutes this world's experience, is only one\nportion of the total universe, and that there stretches beyond this\nvisible world an unseen world of which we now know nothing positive,\nbut in its relation to which the true significance of our present\nmundane life consists.  A man's religious faith (whatever more special\nitems of doctrine it may involve) means for me essentially his faith in\nthe existence of an unseen order of some kind in which the riddles of\nthe natural order may be found explained.  In the more developed\nreligions the natural world has always been regarded as the mere\nscaffolding or vestibule of a truer, more eternal world, and affirmed\nto be a sphere of {52} education, trial, or redemption.  In these\nreligions, one must in some fashion die to the natural life before one\ncan enter into life eternal.  The notion that this physical world of\nwind and water, where the sun rises and the moon sets, is absolutely\nand ultimately the divinely aimed-at and established thing, is one\nwhich we find only in very early religions, such as that of the most\nprimitive Jews.  It is this natural religion (primitive still, in spite\nof the fact that poets and men of science whose good-will exceeds their\nperspicacity keep publishing it in new editions tuned to our\ncontemporary ears) that, as I said a while ago, has suffered definitive\nbankruptcy in the opinion of a circle of persons, among whom I must\ncount myself, and who are growing more numerous every day.  For such\npersons the physical order of nature, taken simply as science knows it,\ncannot be held to reveal any one harmonious spiritual intent.  It is\nmere _weather_, as Chauncey Wright called it, doing and undoing without\nend.\nNow, I wish to make you feel, if I can in the short remainder of this\nhour, that we have a right to believe the physical order to be only a\npartial order; that we have a right to supplement it by an unseen\nspiritual order which we assume on trust, if only thereby life may seem\nto us better worth living again.  But as such a trust will seem to some\nof you sadly mystical and execrably unscientific, I must first say a\nword or two to weaken the veto which you may consider that science\nopposes to our act.\nThere is included in human nature an ingrained naturalism and\nmaterialism of mind which can only admit facts that are actually\ntangible.  Of this sort of mind the entity called 'science' is the\nidol.  {53} Fondness for the word 'scientist' is one of the notes by\nwhich you may know its votaries; and its short way of killing any\nopinion that it disbelieves in is to call it 'unscientific.'  It must\nbe granted that there is no slight excuse for this.  Science has made\nsuch glorious leaps in the last three hundred years, and extended our\nknowledge of nature so enormously both in general and in detail; men of\nscience, moreover, have as a class displayed such admirable\nvirtues,--that it is no wonder if the worshippers of science lose their\nhead.  In this very University, accordingly, I have heard more than one\nteacher say that all the fundamental conceptions of truth have already\nbeen found by science, and that the future has only the details of the\npicture to fill in.  But the slightest reflection on the real\nconditions will suffice to show how barbaric such notions are.  They\nshow such a lack of scientific imagination, that it is hard to see how\none who is actively advancing any part of science can make a mistake so\ncrude.  Think how many absolutely new scientific conceptions have\narisen in our own generation, how many new problems have been\nformulated that were never thought of before, and then cast an eye upon\nthe brevity of science's career.  It began with Galileo, not three\nhundred years ago.  Four thinkers since Galileo, each informing his\nsuccessor of what discoveries his own lifetime had seen achieved, might\nhave passed the torch of science into our hands as we sit here in this\nroom.  Indeed, for the matter of that, an audience much smaller than\nthe present one, an audience of some five or six score people, if each\nperson in it could speak for his own generation, would carry us away to\nthe black unknown of the human species, {54} to days without a document\nor monument to tell their tale.  Is it credible that such a mushroom\nknowledge, such a growth overnight as this, _can_ represent more than\nthe minutest glimpse of what the universe will really prove to be when\nadequately understood?  No! our science is a drop, our ignorance a sea.\nWhatever else be certain, this at least is certain,--that the world of\nour present natural knowledge _is_ enveloped in a larger world of\n_some_ sort of whose residual properties we at present can frame no\npositive idea.\nAgnostic positivism, of course, admits this principle theoretically in\nthe most cordial terms, but insists that we must not turn it to any\npractical use.  We have no right, this doctrine tells us, to dream\ndreams, or suppose anything about the unseen part of the universe,\nmerely because to do so may be for what we are pleased to call our\nhighest interests.  We must always wait for sensible evidence for our\nbeliefs; and where such evidence is inaccessible we must frame no\nhypotheses whatever.  Of course this is a safe enough position _in\nabstracto_.  If a thinker had no stake in the unknown, no vital needs,\nto live or languish according to what the unseen world contained, a\nphilosophic neutrality and refusal to believe either one way or the\nother would be his wisest cue.  But, unfortunately, neutrality is not\nonly inwardly difficult, it is also outwardly unrealizable, where our\nrelations to an alternative are practical and vital.  This is because,\nas the psychologists tell us, belief and doubt are living attitudes,\nand involve conduct on our part.  Our only way, for example, of\ndoubting, or refusing to believe, that a certain thing _is_, is\ncontinuing to act as if it were _not_.  If, for instance, {55} I refuse\nto believe that the room is getting cold, I leave the windows open and\nlight no fire just as if it still were warm.  If I doubt that you are\nworthy of my confidence, I keep you uninformed of all my secrets just\nas if you were _un_worthy of the same.  If I doubt the need of insuring\nmy house, I leave it uninsured as much as if I believed there were no\nneed.  And so if I must not believe that the world is divine, I can\nonly express that refusal by declining ever to act distinctively as if\nit were so, which can only mean acting on certain critical occasions as\nif it were _not_ so, or in an irreligious way.  There are, you see,\ninevitable occasions in life when inaction is a kind of action, and\nmust count as action, and when not to be for is to be practically\nagainst; and in all such cases strict and consistent neutrality is an\nunattainable thing.\nAnd, after all, is not this duty of neutrality where only our inner\ninterests would lead us to believe, the most ridiculous of commands?\nIs it not sheer dogmatic folly to say that our inner interests can have\nno real connection with the forces that the hidden world may contain?\nIn other cases divinations based on inner interests have proved\nprophetic enough.  Take science itself!  Without an imperious inner\ndemand on our part for ideal logical and mathematical harmonies, we\nshould never have attained to proving that such harmonies be hidden\nbetween all the chinks and interstices of the crude natural world.\nHardly a law has been established in science, hardly a fact\nascertained, which was not first sought after, often with sweat and\nblood, to gratify an inner need.  Whence such needs come from we do not\nknow; we find them in us, and biological psychology so far only classes\nthem with Darwin's 'accidental variations.' {56} But the inner need of\nbelieving that this world of nature is a sign of something more\nspiritual and eternal than itself is just as strong and authoritative\nin those who feel it, as the inner need of uniform laws of causation\never can be in a professionally scientific head.  The toil of many\ngenerations has proved the latter need prophetic.  Why _may_ not the\nformer one be prophetic, too?  And if needs of ours outrun the visible\nuniverse, why _may_ not that be a sign that an invisible universe is\nthere?  What, in short, has authority to debar us from trusting our\nreligious demands?  Science as such assuredly has no authority, for she\ncan only say what is, not what is not; and the agnostic \"thou shalt not\nbelieve without coercive sensible evidence\" is simply an expression\n(free to any one to make) of private personal appetite for evidence of\na certain peculiar kind.\nNow, when I speak of trusting our religious demands, just what do I\nmean by 'trusting'?  Is the word to carry with it license to define in\ndetail an invisible world, and to anathematize and excommunicate those\nwhose trust is different?  Certainly not!  Our faculties of belief were\nnot primarily given us to make orthodoxies and heresies withal; they\nwere given us to live by.  And to trust our religious demands means\nfirst of all to live in the light of them, and to act as if the\ninvisible world which they suggest were real.  It is a fact of human\nnature, that men can live and die by the help of a sort of faith that\ngoes without a single dogma or definition.  The bare assurance that\nthis natural order is not ultimate but a mere sign or vision, the\nexternal staging of a many-storied universe, in which spiritual forces\nhave the last word and are eternal,--this bare {57} assurance is to\nsuch men enough to make life seem worth living in spite of every\ncontrary presumption suggested by its circumstances on the natural\nplane.  Destroy this inner assurance, however, vague as it is, and all\nthe light and radiance of existence is extinguished for these persons\nat a stroke.  Often enough the wild-eyed look at life--the suicidal\nmood--will then set in.\nAnd now the application comes directly home to you and me.  Probably to\nalmost every one of us here the most adverse life would seem well worth\nliving, if we only could be _certain_ that our bravery and patience\nwith it were terminating and eventuating and bearing fruit somewhere in\nan unseen spiritual world.  But granting we are not certain, does it\nthen follow that a bare trust in such a world is a fool's paradise and\nlubberland, or rather that it is a living attitude in which we are free\nto indulge?  Well, we are free to trust at our own risks anything that\nis not impossible, and that can bring analogies to bear in its behalf.\nThat the world of physics is probably not absolute, all the converging\nmultitude of arguments that make in favor of idealism tend to prove;\nand that our whole physical life may lie soaking in a spiritual\natmosphere, a dimension of being that we at present have no organ for\napprehending, is vividly suggested to us by the analogy of the life of\nour domestic animals.  Our dogs, for example, are in our human life but\nnot of it.  They witness hourly the outward body of events whose inner\nmeaning cannot, by any possible operation, be revealed to their\nintelligence,--events in which they themselves often play the cardinal\npart.  My terrier bites a teasing boy, for example, and the father\ndemands damages.  The dog {58} may be present at every step of the\nnegotiations, and see the money paid, without an inkling of what it all\nmeans, without a suspicion that it has anything to do with _him_; and\nhe never _can_ know in his natural dog's life.  Or take another case\nwhich used greatly to impress me in my medical-student days.  Consider\na poor dog whom they are vivisecting in a laboratory.  He lies strapped\non a board and shrieking at his executioners, and to his own dark\nconsciousness is literally in a sort of hell.  He cannot see a single\nredeeming ray in the whole business; and yet all these\ndiabolical-seeming events are often controlled by human intentions with\nwhich, if his poor benighted mind could only be made to catch a glimpse\nof them, all that is heroic in him would religiously acquiesce.\nHealing truth, relief to future sufferings of beast and man, are to be\nbought by them.  It may be genuinely a process of redemption.  Lying on\nhis back on the board there he may be performing a function\nincalculably higher than any that prosperous canine life admits of; and\nyet, of the whole performance, this function is the one portion that\nmust remain absolutely beyond his ken.\nNow turn from this to the life of man.  In the dog's life we see the\nworld invisible to him because we live in both worlds.  In human life,\nalthough we only see our world, and his within it, yet encompassing\nboth these worlds a still wider world may be there, as unseen by us as\nour world is by him; and to believe in that world _may_ be the most\nessential function that our lives in this world have to perform.  But\n\"_may_ be! _may_ be!\" one now hears the positivist contemptuously\nexclaim; \"what use can a scientific life have for maybes?\"  Well, I\nreply, the {59} 'scientific' life itself has much to do with maybes,\nand human life at large has everything to do with them.  So far as man\nstands for anything, and is productive or originative at all, his\nentire vital function may be said to have to deal with maybes.  Not a\nvictory is gained, not a deed of faithfulness or courage is done,\nexcept upon a maybe; not a service, not a sally of generosity, not a\nscientific exploration or experiment or text-book, that may not be a\nmistake.  It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another\nthat we live at all.  And often enough our faith beforehand in an\nuncertified result _is the only thing that makes the result come true_.\nSuppose, for instance, that you are climbing a mountain, and have\nworked yourself into a position from which the only escape is by a\nterrible leap.  Have faith that you can successfully make it, and your\nfeet are nerved to its accomplishment.  But mistrust yourself, and\nthink of all the sweet things you have heard the scientists say of\nmaybes, and you will hesitate so long that, at last, all unstrung and\ntrembling, and launching yourself in a moment of despair, you roll in\nthe abyss.  In such a case (and it belongs to an enormous class), the\npart of wisdom as well as of courage is to _believe what is in the line\nof your needs_, for only by such belief is the need fulfilled.  Refuse\nto believe, and you shall indeed be right, for you shall irretrievably\nperish.  But believe, and again you shall be right, for you shall save\nyourself.  You make one or the other of two possible universes true by\nyour trust or mistrust,--both universes having been only _maybes_, in\nthis particular, before you contributed your act.\nNow, it appears to me that the question whether life is worth living is\nsubject to conditions logically {60} much like these.  It does, indeed,\ndepend on you _the liver_.  If you surrender to the nightmare view and\ncrown the evil edifice by your own suicide, you have indeed made a\npicture totally black.  Pessimism, completed by your act, is true\nbeyond a doubt, so far as your world goes.  Your mistrust of life has\nremoved whatever worth your own enduring existence might have given to\nit; and now, throughout the whole sphere of possible influence of that\nexistence, the mistrust has proved itself to have had divining power.\nBut suppose, on the other hand, that instead of giving way to the\nnightmare view you cling to it that this world is not the _ultimatum_.\nSuppose you find yourself a very well-spring, as Wordsworth says, of--\n\"Zeal, and the virtue to exist by faith\nAs soldiers live by courage; as, by strength\nOf heart, the sailor fights with roaring seas.\"\nSuppose, however thickly evils crowd upon you, that your unconquerable\nsubjectivity proves to be their match, and that you find a more\nwonderful joy than any passive pleasure can bring in trusting ever in\nthe larger whole.  Have you not now made life worth living on these\nterms?  What sort of a thing would life really be, with your qualities\nready for a tussle with it, if it only brought fair weather and gave\nthese higher faculties of yours no scope?  Please remember that\noptimism and pessimism are definitions of the world, and that our own\nreactions on the world, small as they are in bulk, are integral parts\nof the whole thing, and necessarily help to determine the definition.\nThey may even be the decisive elements in determining the definition.\nA large mass can have its unstable equilibrium overturned by the\naddition {61} of a feather's weight; a long phrase may have its sense\nreversed by the addition of the three letters _n-o-t_.  This life is\nworth living, we can say, _since it is what we make it, from the moral\npoint of view_; and we are determined to make it from that point of\nview, so far as we have anything to do with it, a success.\nNow, in this description of faiths that verify themselves I have\nassumed that our faith in an invisible order is what inspires those\nefforts and that patience which make this visible order good for moral\nmen.  Our faith in the seen world's goodness (goodness now meaning\nfitness for successful moral and religious life) has verified itself by\nleaning on our faith in the unseen world.  But will our faith in the\nunseen world similarly verify itself?  Who knows?\nOnce more it is a case of _maybe_; and once more maybes are the essence\nof the situation.  I confess that I do not see why the very existence\nof an invisible world may not in part depend on the personal response\nwhich any one of us may make to the religious appeal.  God himself, in\nshort, may draw vital strength and increase of very being from our\nfidelity.  For my own part, I do not know what the sweat and blood and\ntragedy of this life mean, if they mean anything short of this.  If\nthis life be not a real fight, in which something is eternally gained\nfor the universe by success, it is no better than a game of private\ntheatricals from which one may withdraw at will.  But it _feels_ like a\nreal fight,--as if there were something really wild in the universe\nwhich we, with all our idealities and faithfulnesses, are needed to\nredeem; and first of all to redeem our own hearts from atheisms and\nfears.  For such a half-wild, half-saved universe our nature is\nadapted.  The deepest thing in our {62} nature is this _Binnenleben_\n(as a German doctor lately has called it), this dumb region of the\nheart in which we dwell alone with our willingnesses and\nunwillingnesses, our faiths and fears.  As through the cracks and\ncrannies of caverns those waters exude from the earth's bosom which\nthen form the fountain-heads of springs, so in these crepuscular depths\nof personality the sources of all our outer deeds and decisions take\ntheir rise.  Here is our deepest organ of communication with the nature\nof things; and compared with these concrete movements of our soul all\nabstract statements and scientific arguments--the veto, for example,\nwhich the strict positivist pronounces upon our faith--sound to us like\nmere chatterings of the teeth.  For here possibilities, not finished\nfacts, are the realities with which we have actively to deal; and to\nquote my friend William Salter, of the Philadelphia Ethical Society,\n\"as the essence of courage is to stake one's life on a possibility, so\nthe essence of faith is to believe that the possibility exists.\"\nThese, then, are my last words to you: Be not afraid of life.  Believe\nthat life _is_ worth living, and your belief will help create the fact.\nThe 'scientific proof' that you are right may not be clear before the\nday of judgment (or some stage of being which that expression may serve\nto symbolize) is reached.  But the faithful fighters of this hour, or\nthe beings that then and there will represent them, may then turn to\nthe faint-hearted, who here decline to go on, with words like those\nwith which Henry IV.  greeted the tardy Crillon after a great victory\nhad been gained: \"Hang yourself, brave Crillon! we fought at Arques,\nand you were not there.\"\n[1] An Address to the Harvard Young Men's Christian Association.\nPublished in the International Journal of Ethics for October, 1895, and\nas a pocket volume by S.

Almost every one will immediately reply:\nThey desire to attain a conception of the frame of things which shall\non the whole be more rational than that somewhat chaotic view which\nevery one by nature carries about with him under his hat.  But suppose\nthis rational conception attained, how is the philosopher to recognize\nit for what it is, and not let it slip through ignorance?  The only\nanswer can be that he will recognize its rationality as he recognizes\neverything else, by certain subjective marks with which it affects him.\nWhen he gets the marks, he may know that he has got the rationality.\nWhat, then, are the marks?  A strong feeling of ease, peace, rest, is\none of them.  The transition from a state of puzzle and perplexity to\nrational comprehension is full of lively relief and pleasure.\nBut this relief seems to be a negative rather than a positive\ncharacter.  Shall we then say that the feeling of rationality is\nconstituted merely by the absence {64} of any feeling of irrationality?\nI think there are very good grounds for upholding such a view.  All\nfeeling whatever, in the light of certain recent psychological\nspeculations, seems to depend for its physical condition not on simple\ndischarge of nerve-currents, but on their discharge under arrest,\nimpediment, or resistance.  Just as we feel no particular pleasure when\nwe breathe freely, but a very intense feeling of distress when the\nrespiratory motions are prevented,--so any unobstructed tendency to\naction discharges itself without the production of much cogitative\naccompaniment, and any perfectly fluent course of thought awakens but\nlittle feeling; but when the movement is inhibited, or when the thought\nmeets with difficulties, we experience distress.  It is only when the\ndistress is upon us that we can be said to strive, to crave, or to\naspire.  When enjoying plenary freedom either in the way of motion or\nof thought, we are in a sort of anaesthetic state in which we might say\nwith Walt Whitman, if we cared to say anything about ourselves at such\ntimes, \"I am sufficient as I am.\"  This feeling of the sufficiency of\nthe present moment, of its absoluteness,--this absence of all need to\nexplain it, account for it, or justify it,--is what I call the\nSentiment of Rationality.  As soon, in short, as we are enabled from\nany cause whatever to think with perfect fluency, the thing we think of\nseems to us _pro tanto_ rational.\nWhatever modes of conceiving the cosmos facilitate this fluency,\nproduce the sentiment of rationality.  Conceived in such modes, being\nvouches for itself and needs no further philosophic formulation.  But\nthis fluency may be obtained in various ways; and first I will take up\nthe theoretic way.\n{65}\nThe facts of the world in their sensible diversity are always before\nus, but our theoretic need is that they should be conceived in a way\nthat reduces their manifoldness to simplicity.  Our pleasure at finding\nthat a chaos of facts is the expression of a single underlying fact is\nlike the relief of the musician at resolving a confused mass of sound\ninto melodic or harmonic order.  The simplified result is handled with\nfar less mental effort than the original data; and a philosophic\nconception of nature is thus in no metaphorical sense a labor-saving\ncontrivance.  The passion for parsimony, for economy of means in\nthought, is the philosophic passion _par excellence_; and any character\nor aspect of the world's phenomena which gathers up their diversity\ninto monotony will gratify that passion, and in the philosopher's mind\nstand for that essence of things compared with which all their other\ndeterminations may by him be overlooked.\nMore universality or extensiveness is, then, one mark which the\nphilosopher's conceptions must possess.  Unless they apply to an\nenormous number of cases they will not bring him relief.  The knowledge\nof things by their causes, which is often given as a definition of\nrational knowledge, is useless to him unless the causes converge to a\nminimum number, while still producing the maximum number of effects.\nThe more multiple then are the instances, the more flowingly does his\nmind rove from fact to fact.  The phenomenal transitions are no real\ntransitions; each item is the same old friend with a slightly altered\ndress.\nWho does not feel the charm of thinking that the moon and the apple\nare, as far as their relation to the {66} earth goes, identical; of\nknowing respiration and combustion to be one; of understanding that the\nballoon rises by the same law whereby the stone sinks; of feeling that\nthe warmth in one's palm when one rubs one's sleeve is identical with\nthe motion which the friction checks; of recognizing the difference\nbetween beast and fish to be only a higher degree of that between human\nfather and son; of believing our strength when we climb the mountain or\nfell the tree to be no other than the strength of the sun's rays which\nmade the corn grow out of which we got our morning meal?\nBut alongside of this passion for simplification there exists a sister\npassion, which in some minds--though they perhaps form the minority--is\nits rival.  This is the passion for distinguishing; it is the impulse\nto be _acquainted_ with the parts rather than to comprehend the whole.\nLoyalty to clearness and integrity of perception, dislike of blurred\noutlines, of vague identifications, are its characteristics.  It loves\nto recognize particulars in their full completeness, and the more of\nthese it can carry the happier it is.  It prefers any amount of\nincoherence, abruptness, and fragmentariness (so long as the literal\ndetails of the separate facts are saved) to an abstract way of\nconceiving things that, while it simplifies them, dissolves away at the\nsame time their concrete fulness.  Clearness and simplicity thus set up\nrival claims, and make a real dilemma for the thinker.\nA man's philosophic attitude is determined by the balance in him of\nthese two cravings.  No system of philosophy can hope to be universally\naccepted among men which grossly violates either need, or {67} entirely\nsubordinates the one to the other.  The fate of Spinosa, with his\nbarren union of all things in one substance, on the one hand; that of\nHume, with his equally barren 'looseness and separateness' of\neverything, on the other,--neither philosopher owning any strict and\nsystematic disciples to-day, each being to posterity a warning as well\nas a stimulus,--show us that the only possible philosophy must be a\ncompromise between an abstract monotony and a concrete heterogeneity.\nBut the only way to mediate between diversity and unity is to class the\ndiverse items as cases of a common essence which you discover in them.\nClassification of things into extensive 'kinds' is thus the first step;\nand classification of their relations and conduct into extensive 'laws'\nis the last step, in their philosophic unification.  A completed\ntheoretic philosophy can thus never be anything more than a completed\nclassification of the world's ingredients; and its results must always\nbe abstract, since the basis of every classification is the abstract\nessence embedded in the living fact,--the rest of the living fact being\nfor the time ignored by the classifier.  This means that none of our\nexplanations are complete.  They subsume things under heads wider or\nmore familiar; but the last heads, whether of things or of their\nconnections, are mere abstract genera, data which we just find in\nthings and write down.\nWhen, for example, we think that we have rationally explained the\nconnection of the facts _A_ and _B_ by classing both under their common\nattribute _x_, it is obvious that we have really explained only so much\nof these items as _is x_.  To explain the connection of choke-damp and\nsuffocation by the lack of oxygen is {68} to leave untouched all the\nother peculiarities both of choke-damp and of suffocation,--such as\nconvulsions and agony on the one hand, density and explosibility on the\nother.  In a word, so far as _A_ and _B_ contain _l_, _m_, _n_, and\n_o_, _p_, _q,_ respectively, in addition to _x_, they are not explained\nby _x_.  Each additional particularity makes its distinct appeal.  A\nsingle explanation of a fact only explains it from a single point of\nview.  The entire fact is not accounted for until each and all of its\ncharacters have been classed with their likes elsewhere.  To apply this\nnow to the case of the universe, we see that the explanation of the\nworld by molecular movements explains it only so far as it actually\n_is_ such movements.  To invoke the 'Unknowable' explains only so much\nas is unknowable, 'Thought' only so much as is thought, 'God' only so\nmuch as is God.  _Which_ thought?  _Which_ God?--are questions that\nhave to be answered by bringing in again the residual data from which\nthe general term was abstracted.  All those data that cannot be\nanalytically identified with the attribute invoked as universal\nprinciple, remain as independent kinds or natures, associated\nempirically with the said attribute but devoid of rational kinship with\nit.\nHence the unsatisfactoriness of all our speculations.  On the one hand,\nso far as they retain any multiplicity in their terms, they fail to get\nus out of the empirical sand-heap world; on the other, so far as they\neliminate multiplicity the practical man despises their empty\nbarrenness.  The most they can say is that the elements of the world\nare such and such, and that each is identical with itself wherever\nfound; but the question Where is it found? the practical man is left to\nanswer by his own wit.  Which, of all the {69} essences, shall here and\nnow be held the essence of this concrete thing, the fundamental\nphilosophy never attempts to decide.  We are thus led to the conclusion\nthat the simple classification of things is, on the one hand, the best\npossible theoretic philosophy, but is, on the other, a most miserable\nand inadequate substitute for the fulness of the truth.  It is a\nmonstrous abridgment of life, which, like all abridgments is got by the\nabsolute loss and casting out of real matter.  This is why so few human\nbeings truly care for philosophy.  The particular determinations which\nshe ignores are the real matter exciting needs, quite as potent and\nauthoritative as hers.  What does the moral enthusiast care for\nphilosophical ethics?  Why does the _AEsthetik_ of every German\nphilosopher appear to the artist an abomination of desolation?\nGrau, theurer Freund, ist alle Theorie\nUnd gr\u00fcn des Lebens goldner Baum.\nThe entire man, who feels all needs by turns, will take nothing as an\nequivalent for life but the fulness of living itself.  Since the\nessences of things are as a matter of fact disseminated through the\nwhole extent of time and space, it is in their spread-outness and\nalternation that he will enjoy them.  When weary of the concrete clash\nand dust and pettiness, he will refresh himself by a bath in the\neternal springs, or fortify himself by a look at the immutable natures.\nBut he will only be a visitor, not a dweller in the region; he will\nnever carry the philosophic yoke upon his shoulders, and when tired of\nthe gray monotony of her problems and insipid spaciousness of her\nresults, will always escape gleefully into the teeming and dramatic\nrichness of the concrete world.\n{70}\nSo our study turns back here to its beginning.  Every way of\nclassifying a thing is but a way of handling it for some particular\npurpose.  Conceptions, 'kinds,' are teleological instruments.  No\nabstract concept can be a valid substitute for a concrete reality\nexcept with reference to a particular interest in the conceiver.  The\ninterest of theoretic rationality, the relief of identification, is but\none of a thousand human purposes.  When others rear their heads, it\nmust pack up its little bundle and retire till its turn recurs.  The\nexaggerated dignity and value that philosophers have claimed for their\nsolutions is thus greatly reduced.  The only virtue their theoretic\nconception need have is simplicity, and a simple conception is an\nequivalent for the world only so far as the world is simple,--the world\nmeanwhile, whatever simplicity it may harbor, being also a mightily\ncomplex affair.  Enough simplicity remains, however, and enough urgency\nin our craving to reach it, to make the theoretic function one of the\nmost invincible of human impulses.  The quest of the fewest elements of\nthings is an ideal that some will follow, as long as there are men to\nthink at all.\nBut suppose the goal attained.  Suppose that at last we have a system\nunified in the sense that has been explained.  Our world can now be\nconceived simply, and our mind enjoys the relief.  Our universal\nconcept has made the concrete chaos rational.  But now I ask, Can that\nwhich is the ground of rationality in all else be itself properly\ncalled rational?  It would seem at first sight that it might.  One is\ntempted at any rate to say that, since the craving for rationality is\nappeased by the identification of one {71} thing with another, a datum\nwhich left nothing else outstanding might quench that craving\ndefinitively, or be rational _in se_.  No otherness being left to annoy\nus, we should sit down at peace.  In other words, as the theoretic\ntranquillity of the boor results from his spinning no further\nconsiderations about his chaotic universe, so any datum whatever\n(provided it were simple, clear, and ultimate) ought to banish puzzle\nfrom the universe of the philosopher and confer peace, inasmuch as\nthere would then be for him absolutely no further considerations to\nspin.\nThis in fact is what some persons think.  Professor Bain says,--\n\"A difficulty is solved, a mystery unriddled, when it can be shown to\nresemble something else; to be an example of a fact already known.\nMystery is isolation, exception, or it may be apparent contradiction:\nthe resolution of the mystery is found in assimilation, identity,\nfraternity.  When all things are assimilated, so far as assimilation\ncan go, so far as likeness holds, there is an end to explanation; there\nis an end to what the mind can do, or can intelligently desire....  The\npath of science as exhibited in modern ages is toward generality, wider\nand wider, until we reach the highest, the widest laws of every\ndepartment of things; there explanation is finished, mystery ends,\nperfect vision is gained.\"\nBut, unfortunately, this first answer will not hold.  Our mind is so\nwedded to the process of seeing an _other_ beside every item of its\nexperience, that when the notion of an absolute datum is presented to\nit, it goes through its usual procedure and remains pointing at the\nvoid beyond, as if in that lay further matter for contemplation.  In\nshort, it spins for itself the further positive consideration of a\nnonentity {72} enveloping the being of its datum; and as that leads\nnowhere, back recoils the thought toward its datum again.  But there is\nno natural bridge between nonentity and this particular datum, and the\nthought stands oscillating to and fro, wondering \"Why was there\nanything but nonentity; why just this universal datum and not another?\"\nand finds no end, in wandering mazes lost.  Indeed, Bain's words are so\nuntrue that in reflecting men it is just when the attempt to fuse the\nmanifold into a single totality has been most successful, when the\nconception of the universe as a unique fact is nearest its perfection,\nthat the craving for further explanation, the ontological\nwonder-sickness, arises in its extremest form.  As Schopenhauer says,\n\"The uneasiness which keeps the never-resting clock of metaphysics in\nmotion, is the consciousness that the non-existence of this world is\njust as possible as its existence.\"\nThe notion of nonentity may thus be called the parent of the\nphilosophic craving in its subtilest and profoundest sense.  Absolute\nexistence is absolute mystery, for its relations with the nothing\nremain unmediated to our understanding.  One philosopher only has\npretended to throw a logical bridge over this chasm.  Hegel, by trying\nto show that nonentity and concrete being are linked together by a\nseries of identities of a synthetic kind, binds everything conceivable\ninto a unity, with no outlying notion to disturb the free rotary\ncirculation of the mind within its bounds.  Since such unchecked\nmovement gives the feeling of rationality, he must be held, if he has\nsucceeded, to have eternally and absolutely quenched all rational\ndemands.\nBut for those who deem Hegel's heroic effort to {73} have failed,\nnought remains but to confess that when all things have been unified to\nthe supreme degree, the notion of a possible other than the actual may\nstill haunt our imagination and prey upon our system.  The bottom of\nbeing is left logically opaque to us, as something which we simply come\nupon and find, and about which (if we wish to act) we should pause and\nwonder as little as possible.  The philosopher's logical tranquillity\nis thus in essence no other than the boor's.  They differ only as to\nthe point at which each refuses to let further considerations upset the\nabsoluteness of the data he assumes.  The boor does so immediately, and\nis liable at any moment to the ravages of many kinds of doubt.  The\nphilosopher does not do so till unity has been reached, and is\nwarranted against the inroads of those considerations, but only\npractically, not essentially, secure from the blighting breath of the\nultimate Why?  If he cannot exorcise this question, he must ignore or\nblink it, and, assuming the data of his system as something given, and\nthe gift as ultimate, simply proceed to a life of contemplation or of\naction based on it.  There is no doubt that this acting on an opaque\nnecessity is accompanied by a certain pleasure.  See the reverence of\nCarlyle for brute fact: \"There is an infinite significance in fact.\"\n\"Necessity,\" says D\u00fchring, and he means not rational but given\nnecessity, \"is the last and highest point that we can reach....  It is\nnot only the interest of ultimate and definitive knowledge, but also\nthat of the feelings, to find a last repose and an ideal equilibrium in\nan uttermost datum which can simply not be other than it is.\"\nSuch is the attitude of ordinary men in their theism, God's fiat being\nin physics and morals such an {74} uttermost datum.  Such also is the\nattitude of all hard-minded analysts and _Verstandesmenschen_.  Lotze,\nRenouvier, and Hodgson promptly say that of experience as a whole no\naccount can be given, but neither seek to soften the abruptness of the\nconfession nor to reconcile us with our impotence.\nBut mediating attempts may be made by more mystical minds.  The peace\nof rationality may be sought through ecstasy when logic fails.  To\nreligious persons of every shade of doctrine moments come when the\nworld, as it is, seems so divinely orderly, and the acceptance of it by\nthe heart so rapturously complete, that intellectual questions vanish;\nnay, the intellect itself is hushed to sleep,--as Wordsworth says,\n\"thought is not; in enjoyment it expires.\"  Ontological emotion so\nfills the soul that ontological speculation can no longer overlap it\nand put her girdle of interrogation-marks round existence.  Even the\nleast religious of men must have felt with Walt Whitman, when loafing\non the grass on some transparent summer morning, that \"swiftly arose\nand spread round him the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument\nof the earth.\"  At such moments of energetic living we feel as if there\nwere something diseased and contemptible, yea vile, in theoretic\ngrubbing and brooding.  In the eye of healthy sense the philosopher is\nat best a learned fool.\nSince the heart can thus wall out the ultimate irrationality which the\nhead ascertains, the erection of its procedure into a systematized\nmethod would be a philosophic achievement of first-rate importance.\nBut as used by mystics hitherto it has lacked universality, being\navailable for few persons and at few times, and {75} even in these\nbeing apt to be followed by fits of reaction and dryness; and if men\nshould agree that the mystical method is a subterfuge without logical\npertinency, a plaster but no cure, and that the idea of non-entity can\nnever be exorcised, empiricism will be the ultimate philosophy.\nExistence then will be a brute fact to which as a whole the emotion of\nontologic wonder shall rightfully cleave, but remain eternally\nunsatisfied.  Then wonderfulness or mysteriousness will be an essential\nattribute of the nature of things, and the exhibition and emphasizing\nof it will continue to be an ingredient in the philosophic industry of\nthe race.  Every generation will produce its Job, its Hamlet, its\nFaust, or its Sartor Resartus.\nWith this we seem to have considered the possibilities of purely\ntheoretic rationality.  But we saw at the outset that rationality meant\nonly unimpeded mental function.  Impediments that arise in the\ntheoretic sphere might perhaps be avoided if the stream of mental\naction should leave that sphere betimes and pass into the practical.\nLet us therefore inquire what constitutes the feeling of rationality in\nits _practical_ aspect.  If thought is not to stand forever pointing at\nthe universe in wonder, if its movement is to be diverted from the\nissueless channel of purely theoretic contemplation, let us ask what\nconception of the universe will awaken active impulses capable of\neffecting this diversion.  A definition of the world which will give\nback to the mind the free motion which has been blocked in the purely\ncontemplative path may so far make the world seem rational again.\nWell, of two conceptions equally fit to satisfy the logical demand,\nthat one which awakens the active {76} impulses, or satisfies other\naesthetic demands better than the other, will be accounted the more\nrational conception, and will deservedly prevail.\nThere is nothing improbable in the supposition that an analysis of the\nworld may yield a number of formulae, all consistent with the facts.\nIn physical science different formulae may explain the phenomena\nequally well,--the one-fluid and the two-fluid theories of electricity,\nfor example.  Why may it not be so with the world?  Why may there not\nbe different points of view for surveying it, within each of which all\ndata harmonize, and which the observer may therefore either choose\nbetween, or simply cumulate one upon another?  A Beethoven\nstring-quartet is truly, as some one has said, a scraping of horses'\ntails on cats' bowels, and may be exhaustively described in such terms;\nbut the application of this description in no way precludes the\nsimultaneous applicability of an entirely different description.  Just\nso a thorough-going interpretation of the world in terms of mechanical\nsequence is compatible with its being interpreted teleologically, for\nthe mechanism itself may be designed.\nIf, then, there were several systems excogitated, equally satisfying to\nour purely logical needs, they would still have to be passed in review,\nand approved or rejected by our aesthetic and practical nature.  Can we\ndefine the tests of rationality which these parts of our nature would\nuse?\nPhilosophers long ago observed the remarkable fact that mere\nfamiliarity with things is able to produce a feeling of their\nrationality.  The empiricist school has been so much struck by this\ncircumstance {77} as to have laid it down that the feeling of\nrationality and the feeling of familiarity are one and the same thing,\nand that no other kind of rationality than this exists.  The daily\ncontemplation of phenomena juxtaposed in a certain order begets an\nacceptance of their connection, as absolute as the repose engendered by\ntheoretic insight into their coherence.  To explain a thing is to pass\neasily back to its antecedents; to know it is easily to foresee its\nconsequents.  Custom, which lets us do both, is thus the source of\nwhatever rationality the thing may gain in our thought.\nIn the broad sense in which rationality was defined at the outset of\nthis essay, it is perfectly apparent that custom must be one of its\nfactors.  We said that any perfectly fluent and easy thought was devoid\nof the sentiment of irrationality.  Inasmuch then as custom acquaints\nus with all the relations of a thing, it teaches us to pass fluently\nfrom that thing to others, and _pro tanto_ tinges it with the rational\ncharacter.\nNow, there is one particular relation of greater practical importance\nthan all the rest,--I mean the relation of a thing to its future\nconsequences.  So long as an object is unusual, our expectations are\nbaffled; they are fully determined as soon as it becomes familiar.  I\ntherefore propose this as the first practical requisite which a\nphilosophic conception must satisfy: _It must, in a general way at\nleast, banish uncertainty from the future_.  The permanent presence of\nthe sense of futurity in the mind has been strangely ignored by most\nwriters, but the fact is that our consciousness at a given moment is\nnever free from the ingredient of expectancy.  Every one knows how when\na painful thing has to be undergone in the {78} near future, the vague\nfeeling that it is impending penetrates all our thought with uneasiness\nand subtly vitiates our mood even when it does not control our\nattention; it keeps us from being at rest, at home in the given\npresent.  The same is true when a great happiness awaits us.  But when\nthe future is neutral and perfectly certain, 'we do not mind it,' as we\nsay, but give an undisturbed attention to the actual.  Let now this\nhaunting sense of futurity be thrown off its bearings or left without\nan object, and immediately uneasiness takes possession of the mind.\nBut in every novel or unclassified experience this is just what occurs;\nwe do not know what will come next; and novelty _per se_ becomes a\nmental irritant, while custom _per se_ is a mental sedative, merely\nbecause the one baffles while the other settles our expectations.\nEvery reader must feel the truth of this.  What is meant by coming 'to\nfeel at home' in a new place, or with new people?  It is simply that,\nat first, when we take up our quarters in a new room, we do not know\nwhat draughts may blow in upon our back, what doors may open, what\nforms may enter, what interesting objects may be found in cupboards and\ncorners.  When after a few days we have learned the range of all these\npossibilities, the feeling of strangeness disappears.  And so it does\nwith people, when we have got past the point of expecting any\nessentially new manifestations from their character.\nThe utility of this emotional effect of expectation is perfectly\nobvious; 'natural selection,' in fact, was bound to bring it about\nsooner or later.  It is of the utmost practical importance to an animal\nthat he should have prevision of the qualities of the objects {79} that\nsurround him, and especially that he should not come to rest in\npresence of circumstances that might be fraught either with peril or\nadvantage,--go to sleep, for example, on the brink of precipices, in\nthe dens of enemies, or view with indifference some new-appearing\nobject that might, if chased, prove an important addition to the\nlarder.  Novelty _ought_ to irritate him.  All curiosity has thus a\npractical genesis.  We need only look at the physiognomy of a dog or a\nhorse when a new object comes into his view, his mingled fascination\nand fear, to see that the element of conscious insecurity or perplexed\nexpectation lies at the root of his emotion.  A dog's curiosity about\nthe movements of his master or a strange object only extends as far as\nthe point of deciding what is going to happen next.  That settled,\ncuriosity is quenched.  The dog quoted by Darwin, whose behavior in\npresence of a newspaper moved by the wind seemed to testify to a sense\n'of the supernatural,' was merely exhibiting the irritation of an\nuncertain future.  A newspaper which could move spontaneously was in\nitself so unexpected that the poor brute could not tell what new\nwonders the next moment might bring forth.\nTo turn back now to philosophy.  An ultimate datum, even though it be\nlogically unrationalized, will, if its quality is such as to define\nexpectancy, be peacefully accepted by the mind; while if it leave the\nleast opportunity for ambiguity in the future, it will to that extent\ncause mental uneasiness if not distress.  Now, in the ultimate\nexplanations of the universe which the craving for rationality has\nelicited from the human mind, the demands of expectancy to be satisfied\nhave always played a fundamental part.  {80} The term set up by\nphilosophers as primordial has been one which banishes the\nincalculable.  'Substance,' for example, means, as Kant says, _das\nBeharrliche_, which will be as it has been, because its being is\nessential and eternal.  And although we may not be able to prophesy in\ndetail the future phenomena to which the substance shall give rise, we\nmay set our minds at rest in a general way, when we have called the\nsubstance God, Perfection, Love, or Reason, by the reflection that\nwhatever is in store for us can never at bottom be inconsistent with\nthe character of this term; so that our attitude even toward the\nunexpected is in a general sense defined.  Take again the notion of\nimmortality, which for common people seems to be the touchstone of\nevery philosophic or religious creed: what is this but a way of saying\nthat the determination of expectancy is the essential factor of\nrationality?  The wrath of science against miracles, of certain\nphilosophers against the doctrine of free-will, has precisely the same\nroot,--dislike to admit any ultimate factor in things which may rout\nour prevision or upset the stability of our outlook.\nAnti-substantialist writers strangely overlook this function in the\ndoctrine of substance; \"If there be such a _substratum_,\" says Mill,\n\"suppose it at this instant miraculously annihilated, and let the\nsensations continue to occur in the same order, and how would the\n_substratum_ be missed?  By what signs should we be able to discover\nthat its existence had terminated?  Should we not have as much reason\nto believe that it still existed as we now have?  And if we should not\nthen be warranted in believing it, how can we be so now?\"  Truly\nenough, if we have {81} already securely bagged our facts in a certain\norder, we can dispense with any further warrant for that order.  But\nwith regard to the facts yet to come the case is far different.  It\ndoes not follow that if substance may be dropped from our conception of\nthe irrecoverably past, it need be an equally empty complication to our\nnotions of the future.  Even if it were true that, for aught we know to\nthe contrary, the substance might develop at any moment a wholly new\nset of attributes, the mere logical form of referring things to a\nsubstance would still (whether rightly or wrongly) remain accompanied\nby a feeling of rest and future confidence.  In spite of the acutest\nnihilistic criticism, men will therefore always have a liking for any\nphilosophy which explains things _per substantiam_.\nA very natural reaction against the theosophizing conceit and\nhide-bound confidence in the upshot of things, which vulgarly\noptimistic minds display, has formed one factor of the scepticism of\nempiricists, who never cease to remind us of the reservoir of\npossibilities alien to our habitual experience which the cosmos may\ncontain, and which, for any warrant we have to the contrary, may turn\nit inside out to-morrow.  Agnostic substantialism like that of Mr.\nSpencer, whose Unknowable is not merely the unfathomable but the\nabsolute-irrational, on which, if consistently represented in thought,\nit is of course impossible to count, performs the same function of\nrebuking a certain stagnancy and smugness in the manner in which the\nordinary philistine feels his security.  But considered as anything\nelse than as reactions against an opposite excess, these philosophies\nof uncertainty cannot be acceptable; the general mind will fail to {82}\ncome to rest in their presence, and will seek for solutions of a more\nreassuring kind.\nWe may then, I think, with perfect confidence lay down as a first point\ngained in our inquiry, that a prime factor in the philosophic craving\nis the desire to have expectancy defined; and that no philosophy will\ndefinitively triumph which in an emphatic manner denies the possibility\nof gratifying this need.\nWe pass with this to the next great division of our topic.  It is not\nsufficient for our satisfaction merely to know the future as\ndetermined, for it may be determined in either of many ways, agreeable\nor disagreeable.  For a philosophy to succeed on a universal scale it\nmust define the future _congruously with our spontaneous powers_.  A\nphilosophy may be unimpeachable in other respects, but either of two\ndefects will be fatal to its universal acceptance.  First, its ultimate\nprinciple must not be one that essentially baffles and disappoints our\ndearest desires and most cherished powers.  A pessimistic principle\nlike Schopenhauer's incurably vicious Will-substance, or Hartmann's\nwicked jack-of-all-trades the Unconscious, will perpetually call forth\nessays at other philosophies.  Incompatibility of the future with their\ndesires and active tendencies is, in fact, to most men a source of more\nfixed disquietude than uncertainty itself.  Witness the attempts to\novercome the 'problem of evil,' the 'mystery of pain.'  There is no\n'problem of good.'\nBut a second and worse defect in a philosophy than that of\ncontradicting our active propensities is to give them no object\nwhatever to press against.  A philosophy whose principle is so\nincommensurate with our most intimate powers as to deny them all {83}\nrelevancy in universal affairs, as to annihilate their motives at one\nblow, will be even more unpopular than pessimism.  Better face the\nenemy than the eternal Void!  This is why materialism will always fail\nof universal adoption, however well it may fuse things into an\natomistic unity, however clearly it may prophesy the future eternity.\nFor materialism denies reality to the objects of almost all the\nimpulses which we most cherish.  The real _meaning_ of the impulses, it\nsays, is something which has no emotional interest for us whatever.\nNow, what is called 'extradition' is quite as characteristic of our\nemotions as of our senses: both point to an object as the cause of the\npresent feeling.  What an intensely objective reference lies in fear!\nIn like manner an enraptured man and a dreary-feeling man are not\nsimply aware of their subjective states; if they were, the force of\ntheir feelings would all evaporate.  Both believe there is outward\ncause why they should feel as they do: either, \"It is a glad world! how\ngood life is!\" or, \"What a loathsome tedium is existence!\"  Any\nphilosophy which annihilates the validity of the reference by\nexplaining away its objects or translating them into terms of no\nemotional pertinency, leaves the mind with little to care or act for.\nThis is the opposite condition from that of nightmare, but when acutely\nbrought home to consciousness it produces a kindred horror.  In\nnightmare we have motives to act, but no power; here we have powers,\nbut no motives.  A nameless _unheimlichkeit_ comes over us at the\nthought of there being nothing eternal in our final purposes, in the\nobjects of those loves and aspirations which are our deepest energies.\nThe monstrously lopsided equation of the universe and its {84} knower,\nwhich we postulate as the ideal of cognition, is perfectly paralleled\nby the no less lopsided equation of the universe and the _doer_.  We\ndemand in it a character for which our emotions and active propensities\nshall be a match.  Small as we are, minute as is the point by which the\ncosmos impinges upon each one of us, each one desires to feel that his\nreaction at that point is congruous with the demands of the vast\nwhole,--that he balances the latter, so to speak, and is able to do\nwhat it expects of him.  But as his abilities to do lie wholly in the\nline of his natural propensities; as he enjoys reacting with such\nemotions as fortitude, hope, rapture, admiration, earnestness, and the\nlike; and as he very unwillingly reacts with fear, disgust, despair, or\ndoubt,--a philosophy which should only legitimate emotions of the\nlatter sort would be sure to leave the mind a prey to discontent and\ncraving.\nIt is far too little recognized how entirely the intellect is built up\nof practical interests.  The theory of evolution is beginning to do\nvery good service by its reduction of all mentality to the type of\nreflex action.  Cognition, in this view, is but a fleeting moment, a\ncross-section at a certain point, of what in its totality is a motor\nphenomenon.  In the lower forms of life no one will pretend that\ncognition is anything more than a guide to appropriate action.  The\ngerminal question concerning things brought for the first time before\nconsciousness is not the theoretic 'What is that?' but the practical\n'Who goes there?' or rather, as Horwicz has admirably put it, 'What is\nto be done?'--'Was fang' ich an?'  In all our discussions about the\nintelligence of lower animals, the only test we use is that of their\n_acting_ as if for a purpose.  {85} Cognition, in short, is incomplete\nuntil discharged in act; and although it is true that the later mental\ndevelopment, which attains its maximum through the hypertrophied\ncerebrum of man, gives birth to a vast amount of theoretic activity\nover and above that which is immediately ministerial to practice, yet\nthe earlier claim is only postponed, not effaced, and the active nature\nasserts its rights to the end.\nWhen the cosmos in its totality is the object offered to consciousness,\nthe relation is in no whit altered.  React on it we must in some\ncongenial way.  It was a deep instinct in Schopenhauer which led him to\nreinforce his pessimistic argumentation by a running volley of\ninvective against the practical man and his requirements.  No hope for\npessimism unless he is slain!\nHelmholtz's immortal works on the eye and ear are to a great extent\nlittle more than a commentary on the law that practical utility wholly\ndetermines which parts of our sensations we shall be aware of, and\nwhich parts we shall ignore.  We notice or discriminate an ingredient\nof sense only so far as we depend upon it to modify our actions.  We\n_comprehend_ a thing when we synthetize it by identity with another\nthing.  But the other great department of our understanding,\n_acquaintance_ (the two departments being recognized in all languages\nby the antithesis of such words as _wissen_ and _kennen_; _scire_ and\n_noscere_, etc.), what is that also but a synthesis,--a synthesis of a\npassive perception with a certain tendency to reaction?  We are\nacquainted with a thing as soon as we have learned how to behave\ntowards it, or how to meet the behavior which we expect from it.  Up to\nthat point it is still 'strange' to us.\n{86}\nIf there be anything at all in this view, it follows that however\nvaguely a philosopher may define the ultimate universal datum, he\ncannot be said to leave it unknown to us so long as he in the slightest\ndegree pretends that our emotional or active attitude toward it should\nbe of one sort rather than another.  He who says \"life is real, life is\nearnest,\" however much he may speak of the fundamental mysteriousness\nof things, gives a distinct definition to that mysteriousness by\nascribing to it the right to claim from us the particular mood called\nseriousness,--which means the willingness to live with energy, though\nenergy bring pain.  The same is true of him who says that all is\nvanity.  For indefinable as the predicate 'vanity' may be _in se_, it\nis clearly something that permits anaesthesia, mere escape from\nsuffering, to be our rule of life.  There can be no greater incongruity\nthan for a disciple of Spencer to proclaim with one breath that the\nsubstance of things is unknowable, and with the next that the thought\nof it should inspire us with awe, reverence, and a willingness to add\nour co-operative push in the direction toward which its manifestations\nseem to be drifting.  The unknowable may be unfathomed, but if it make\nsuch distinct demands upon our activity we surely are not ignorant of\nits essential quality.\nIf we survey the field of history and ask what feature all great\nperiods of revival, of expansion of the human mind, display in common,\nwe shall find, I think, simply this: that each and all of them have\nsaid to the human being, \"The inmost nature of the reality is congenial\nto _powers_ which you possess.\"  In what did the emancipating message\nof primitive Christianity consist but in the announcement that {87} God\nrecognizes those weak and tender impulses which paganism had so rudely\noverlooked?  Take repentance: the man who can do nothing rightly can at\nleast repent of his failures.  But for paganism this faculty of\nrepentance was a pure supernumerary, a straggler too late for the fair.\nChristianity took it, and made it the one power within us which\nappealed straight to the heart of God.  And after the night of the\nmiddle ages had so long branded with obloquy even the generous impulses\nof the flesh, and defined the reality to be such that only slavish\nnatures could commune with it, in what did the _sursum corda_ of the\nplatonizing renaissance lie but in the proclamation that the archetype\nof verity in things laid claim on the widest activity of our whole\naesthetic being?  What were Luther's mission and Wesley's but appeals\nto powers which even the meanest of men might carry with them,--faith\nand self-despair,--but which were personal, requiring no priestly\nintermediation, and which brought their owner face to face with God?\nWhat caused the wildfire influence of Rousseau but the assurance he\ngave that man's nature was in harmony with the nature of things, if\nonly the paralyzing corruptions of custom would stand from between?\nHow did Kant and Fichte, Goethe and Schiller, inspire their time with\ncheer, except by saying, \"Use all your powers; that is the only\nobedience the universe exacts\"?  And Carlyle with his gospel of work,\nof fact, of veracity, how does he move us except by saying that the\nuniverse imposes no tasks upon us but such as the most humble can\nperform?  Emerson's creed that everything that ever was or will be is\nhere in the enveloping now; that man has but to obey himself,--\"He who\nwill rest in what he _is_, {88} is a part of destiny,\"--is in like\nmanner nothing but an exorcism of all scepticism as to the pertinency\nof one's natural faculties.\nIn a word, \"Son of Man, _stand upon thy feet_ and I will speak unto\nthee!\" is the only revelation of truth to which the solving epochs have\nhelped the disciple.  But that has been enough to satisfy the greater\npart of his rational need.  _In se_ and _per se_ the universal essence\nhas hardly been more defined by any of these formulas than by the\nagnostic _x_; but the mere assurance that my powers, such as they are,\nare not irrelevant to it, but pertinent; that it speaks to them and\nwill in some way recognize their reply; that I can be a match for it if\nI will, and not a footless waif,--suffices to make it rational to my\nfeeling in the sense given above.  Nothing could be more absurd than to\nhope for the definitive triumph of any philosophy which should refuse\nto legitimate, and to legitimate in an emphatic manner, the more\npowerful of our emotional and practical tendencies.  Fatalism, whose\nsolving word in all crises of behavior is \"all striving is vain,\" will\nnever reign supreme, for the impulse to take life strivingly is\nindestructible in the race.  Moral creeds which speak to that impulse\nwill be widely successful in spite of inconsistency, vagueness, and\nshadowy determination of expectancy.  Man needs a rule for his will,\nand will invent one if one be not given him.\nBut now observe a most important consequence.  Men's active impulses\nare so differently mixed that a philosophy fit in this respect for\nBismarck will almost certainly be unfit for a valetudinarian poet.  In\nother words, although one can lay down in advance the {89} rule that a\nphilosophy which utterly denies all fundamental ground for seriousness,\nfor effort, for hope, which says the nature of things is radically\nalien to human nature, can never succeed,--one cannot in advance say\nwhat particular dose of hope, or of gnosticism of the nature of things,\nthe definitely successful philosophy shall contain.  In short, it is\nalmost certain that personal temperament will here make itself felt,\nand that although all men will insist on being spoken to by the\nuniverse in some way, few will insist on being spoken to in just the\nsame way.  We have here, in short, the sphere of what Matthew Arnold\nlikes to call _Aberglaube_, legitimate, inexpugnable, yet doomed to\neternal variations and disputes.\nTake idealism and materialism as examples of what I mean, and suppose\nfor a moment that both give a conception of equal theoretic clearness\nand consistency, and that both determine our expectations equally well.\nIdealism will be chosen by a man of one emotional constitution,\nmaterialism by another.  At this very day all sentimental natures, fond\nof conciliation and intimacy, tend to an idealistic faith.  Why?\nBecause idealism gives to the nature of things such kinship with our\npersonal selves.  Our own thoughts are what we are most at home with,\nwhat we are least afraid of.  To say then that the universe essentially\nis thought, is to say that I myself, potentially at least, am all.\nThere is no radically alien corner, but an all-pervading _intimacy_.\nNow, in certain sensitively egotistic minds this conception of reality\nis sure to put on a narrow, close, sick-room air.  Everything\nsentimental and priggish will be consecrated by it.  That element in\nreality which every strong man of common-sense willingly feels there\nbecause it calls forth {90} powers that he owns--the rough, harsh,\nsea-wave, north-wind element, the denier of persons, the\ndemocratizer--is banished because it jars too much on the desire for\ncommunion.  Now, it is the very enjoyment of this element that throws\nmany men upon the materialistic or agnostic hypothesis, as a polemic\nreaction against the contrary extreme.  They sicken at a life wholly\nconstituted of intimacy.  There is an overpowering desire at moments to\nescape personality, to revel in the action of forces that have no\nrespect for our ego, to let the tides flow, even though they flow over\nus.  The strife of these two kinds of mental temper will, I think,\nalways be seen in philosophy.  Some men will keep insisting on the\nreason, the atonement, that lies in the heart of things, and that we\ncan act _with_; others, on the opacity of brute fact that we must react\n_against_.\nNow, there is one element of our active nature which the Christian\nreligion has emphatically recognized, but which philosophers as a rule\nhave with great insincerity tried to huddle out of sight in their\npretension to found systems of absolute certainty.  I mean the element\nof faith.  Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is\nstill theoretically possible; and as the test of belief is willingness\nto act, one may say that faith is the readiness to act in a cause the\nprosperous issue of which is not certified to us in advance.  It is in\nfact the same moral quality which we call courage in practical affairs;\nand there will be a very widespread tendency in men of vigorous nature\nto enjoy a certain amount of uncertainty in their philosophic creed,\njust as risk lends a zest to worldly activity.  Absolutely certified\nphilosophies {91} seeking the _inconcussum_ are fruits of mental\nnatures in which the passion for identity (which we saw to be but one\nfactor of the rational appetite) plays an abnormally exclusive part.\nIn the average man, on the contrary, the power to trust, to risk a\nlittle beyond the literal evidence, is an essential function.  Any mode\nof conceiving the universe which makes an appeal to this generous\npower, and makes the man seem as if he were individually helping to\ncreate the actuality of the truth whose metaphysical reality he is\nwilling to assume, will be sure to be responded to by large numbers.\nThe necessity of faith as an ingredient in our mental attitude is\nstrongly insisted on by the scientific philosophers of the present day;\nbut by a singularly arbitrary caprice they say that it is only\nlegitimate when used in the interests of one particular\nproposition,--the proposition, namely, that the course of nature is\nuniform.  That nature will follow to-morrow the same laws that she\nfollows to-day is, they all admit, a truth which no man can _know_; but\nin the interests of cognition as well as of action we must postulate or\nassume it.  As Helmholtz says: \"Hier gilt nur der eine Rath: vertraue\nund handle!\"  And Professor Bain urges: \"Our only error is in proposing\nto give any reason or justification of the postulate, or to treat it as\notherwise than begged at the very outset.\"\nWith regard to all other possible truths, however, a number of our most\ninfluential contemporaries think that an attitude of faith is not only\nillogical but shameful.  Faith in a religious dogma for which there is\nno outward proof, but which we are tempted to postulate for our\nemotional interests, just as we {92} postulate the uniformity of nature\nfor our intellectual interests, is branded by Professor Huxley as \"the\nlowest depth of immorality.\"  Citations of this kind from leaders of\nthe modern _Aufkl\u00e4rung_ might be multiplied almost indefinitely.  Take\nProfessor Clifford's article on the 'Ethics of Belief.'  He calls it\n'guilt' and 'sin' to believe even the truth without 'scientific\nevidence.'  But what is the use of being a genius, unless _with the\nsame scientific evidence_ as other men, one can reach more truth than\nthey?  Why does Clifford fearlessly proclaim his belief in the\nconscious-automaton theory, although the 'proofs' before him are the\nsame which make Mr. Lewes reject it?  Why does he believe in primordial\nunits of 'mind-stuff' on evidence which would seem quite worthless to\nProfessor Bain?  Simply because, like every human being of the\nslightest mental originality, he is peculiarly sensitive to evidence\nthat bears in some one direction.  It is utterly hopeless to try to\nexorcise such sensitiveness by calling it the disturbing subjective\nfactor, and branding it as the root of all evil.  'Subjective' be it\ncalled! and 'disturbing' to those whom it foils!  But if it helps those\nwho, as Cicero says, \"vim naturae magis sentiunt,\" it is good and not\nevil.  Pretend what we may, the whole man within us is at work when we\nform our philosophical opinions.  Intellect, will, taste, and passion\nco-operate just as they do in practical affairs; and lucky it is if the\npassion be not something as petty as a love of personal conquest over\nthe philosopher across the way.  The absurd abstraction of an intellect\nverbally formulating all its evidence and carefully estimating the\nprobability thereof by a vulgar fraction by the size of whose\ndenominator and numerator alone it is swayed, is {93} ideally as inept\nas it is actually impossible.  It is almost incredible that men who are\nthemselves working philosophers should pretend that any philosophy can\nbe, or ever has been, constructed without the help of personal\npreference, belief, or divination.  How have they succeeded in so\nstultifying their sense for the living facts of human nature as not to\nperceive that every philosopher, or man of science either, whose\ninitiative counts for anything in the evolution of thought, has taken\nhis stand on a sort of dumb conviction that the truth must lie in one\ndirection rather than another, and a sort of preliminary assurance that\nhis notion can be made to work; and has borne his best fruit in trying\nto make it work?  These mental instincts in different men are the\nspontaneous variations upon which the intellectual struggle for\nexistence is based.  The fittest conceptions survive, and with them the\nnames of their champions shining to all futurity.\nThe coil is about us, struggle as we may.  The only escape from faith\nis mental nullity.  What we enjoy most in a Huxley or a Clifford is not\nthe professor with his learning, but the human personality ready to go\nin for what it feels to be right, in spite of all appearances.  The\nconcrete man has but one interest,--to be right.  That for him is the\nart of all arts, and all means are fair which help him to it.  Naked he\nis flung into the world, and between him and nature there are no rules\nof civilized warfare.  The rules of the scientific game, burdens of\nproof, presumptions, _experimenta crucis_, complete inductions, and the\nlike, are only binding on those who enter that game.  As a matter of\nfact we all more or less do enter it, because it helps us to our end.\nBut if the means presume to frustrate the end and call us cheats for\nbeing right in {94} advance of their slow aid, by guesswork or by hook\nor crook, what shall we say of them?  Were all of Clifford's works,\nexcept the Ethics of Belief, forgotten, he might well figure in future\ntreatises on psychology in place of the somewhat threadbare instance of\nthe miser who has been led by the association of ideas to prefer his\ngold to all the goods he might buy therewith.\nIn short, if I am born with such a superior general reaction to\nevidence that I can guess right and act accordingly, and gain all that\ncomes of right action, while my less gifted neighbor (paralyzed by his\nscruples and waiting for more evidence which he dares not anticipate,\nmuch as he longs to) still stands shivering on the brink, by what law\nshall I be forbidden to reap the advantages of my superior native\nsensitiveness?  Of course I yield to my belief in such a case as this\nor distrust it, alike at my peril, just as I do in any of the great\npractical decisions of life.  If my inborn faculties are good, I am a\nprophet; if poor, I am a failure: nature spews me out of her mouth, and\nthere is an end of me.  In the total game of life we stake our persons\nall the while; and if in its theoretic part our persons will help us to\na conclusion, surely we should also stake them there, however\ninarticulate they may be.[2]\n{95}\nBut in being myself so very articulate in proving what to all readers\nwith a sense for reality will seem a platitude, am I not wasting words?\nWe cannot live or think at all without some degree of faith.  Faith is\nsynonymous with working hypothesis.  The only difference is that while\nsome hypotheses can be refuted in five minutes, others may defy ages.\nA chemist who conjectures that a certain wall-paper contains arsenic,\nand has faith enough to lead him to take the trouble to put some of it\ninto a hydrogen bottle, finds out by the results of his action whether\nhe was right or wrong.  But theories like that of Darwin, or that of\nthe kinetic constitution of matter, may exhaust the labors of\ngenerations in their corroboration, each tester of their truth\nproceeding in this simple way,--that he acts as if it were true, and\nexpects the result to disappoint him if his assumption is false.  The\nlonger disappointment is delayed, the stronger grows his faith in his\ntheory.\nNow, in such questions as God, immortality, absolute morality, and\nfree-will, no non-papal believer at the present day pretends his faith\nto be of an essentially different complexion; he can always doubt his\ncreed.  But his intimate persuasion is that the odds in its favor are\nstrong enough to warrant him in acting all along on the assumption of\nits truth.  His corroboration or repudiation by the nature of things\nmay be deferred until the day of judgment.  The {96} uttermost he now\nmeans is something like this: \"I _expect_ then to triumph with tenfold\nglory; but if it should turn out, as indeed it may, that I have spent\nmy days in a fool's paradise, why, better have been the dupe of _such_\na dreamland than the cunning reader of a world like that which then\nbeyond all doubt unmasks itself to view.\"  In short, we _go in_ against\nmaterialism very much as we should _go in_, had we a chance, against\nthe second French empire or the Church of Rome, or any other system of\nthings toward which our repugnance is vast enough to determine\nenergetic action, but too vague to issue in distinct argumentation.\nOur reasons are ludicrously incommensurate with the volume of our\nfeeling, yet on the latter we unhesitatingly act.\nNow, I wish to show what to my knowledge has never been clearly pointed\nout, that belief (as measured by action) not only does and must\ncontinually outstrip scientific evidence, but that there is a certain\nclass of truths of whose reality belief is a factor as well as a\nconfessor; and that as regards this class of truths faith is not only\nlicit and pertinent, but essential and indispensable.  The truths\ncannot become true till our faith has made them so.\nSuppose, for example, that I am climbing in the Alps, and have had the\nill-luck to work myself into a position from which the only escape is\nby a terrible leap.  Being without similar experience, I have no\nevidence of my ability to perform it successfully; but hope and\nconfidence in myself make me sure I shall not miss my aim, and nerve my\nfeet to execute what without those subjective emotions would perhaps\nhave been impossible.  But suppose that, on the contrary, {97} the\nemotions of fear and mistrust preponderate; or suppose that, having\njust read the Ethics of Belief, I feel it would be sinful to act upon\nan assumption unverified by previous experience,--why, then I shall\nhesitate so long that at last, exhausted and trembling, and launching\nmyself in a moment of despair, I miss my foothold and roll into the\nabyss.  In this case (and it is one of an immense class) the part of\nwisdom clearly is to believe what one desires; for the belief is one of\nthe indispensable preliminary conditions of the realization of its\nobject.  _There are then cases where faith creates its own\nverification_.  Believe, and you shall be right, for you shall save\nyourself; doubt, and you shall again be right, for you shall perish.\nThe only difference is that to believe is greatly to your advantage.\nThe future movements of the stars or the facts of past history are\ndetermined now once for all, whether I like them or not.  They are\ngiven irrespective of my wishes, and in all that concerns truths like\nthese subjective preference should have no part; it can only obscure\nthe judgment.  But in every fact into which there enters an element of\npersonal contribution on my part, as soon as this personal contribution\ndemands a certain degree of subjective energy which, in its turn, calls\nfor a certain amount of faith in the result,--so that, after all, the\nfuture fact is conditioned by my present faith in it,--how trebly\nasinine would it be for me to deny myself the use of the subjective\nmethod, the method of belief based on desire!\nIn every proposition whose bearing is universal (and such are all the\npropositions of philosophy), the acts of the subject and their\nconsequences throughout eternity should be included in the formula.  If\n_M_ {98} represent the entire world _minus_ the reaction of the thinker\nupon it, and if _M_ + _x_ represent the absolutely total matter of\nphilosophic propositions (_x_ standing for the thinker's reaction and\nits results),--what would be a universal truth if the term x were of\none complexion, might become egregious error if _x_ altered its\ncharacter.  Let it not be said that _x_ is too infinitesimal a\ncomponent to change the character of the immense whole in which it lies\nimbedded.  Everything depends on the point of view of the philosophic\nproposition in question.  If we have to define the universe from the\npoint of view of sensibility, the critical material for our judgment\nlies in the animal kingdom, insignificant as that is, quantitatively\nconsidered.  The moral definition of the world may depend on phenomena\nmore restricted still in range.  In short, many a long phrase may have\nits sense reversed by the addition of three letters, _n-o-t_; many a\nmonstrous mass have its unstable equilibrium discharged one way or the\nother by a feather weight that falls.\nLet us make this clear by a few examples.  The philosophy of evolution\noffers us to-day a new criterion to serve as an ethical test between\nright and wrong.  Previous criteria, it says, being subjective, have\nleft us still floundering in variations of opinion and the _status\nbelli_.  Here is a criterion which is objective and fixed: _That is to\nbe called good which is destined to prevail or survive_.  But we\nimmediately see that this standard can only remain objective by leaving\nmyself and my conduct out.  If what prevails and survives does so by my\nhelp, and cannot do so without that help; if something else will\nprevail in case I alter my conduct,--how can I possibly now, conscious\nof alternative courses of action open before me, either of which {99} I\nmay suppose capable of altering the path of events, decide which course\nto take by asking what path events will follow?  If they follow my\ndirection, evidently my direction cannot wait on them.  The only\npossible manner in which an evolutionist can use his standard is the\nobsequious method of forecasting the course society would take _but for\nhim_, and then putting an extinguisher on all personal idiosyncrasies\nof desire and interest, and with bated breath and tiptoe tread\nfollowing as straight as may be at the tail, and bringing up the rear\nof everything.  Some pious creatures may find a pleasure in this; but\nnot only does it violate our general wish to lead and not to follow (a\nwish which is surely not immoral if we but lead aright), but if it be\ntreated as every ethical principle must be treated,--namely, as a rule\ngood for all men alike,--its general observance would lead to its\npractical refutation by bringing about a general deadlock.  Each good\nman hanging back and waiting for orders from the rest, absolute\nstagnation would ensue.  Happy, then, if a few unrighteous ones\ncontribute an initiative which sets things moving again!\nAll this is no caricature.  That the course of destiny may be altered\nby individuals no wise evolutionist ought to doubt.  Everything for him\nhas small beginnings, has a bud which may be 'nipped,' and nipped by a\nfeeble force.  Human races and tendencies follow the law, and have also\nsmall beginnings.  The best, according to evolution, is that which has\nthe biggest endings.  Now, if a present race of men, enlightened in the\nevolutionary philosophy, and able to forecast the future, were able to\ndiscern in a tribe arising near them the potentiality of future\nsupremacy; were able to see that their own {100} race would eventually\nbe wiped out of existence by the new-comers if the expansion of these\nwere left unmolested,--these present sages would have two courses open\nto them, either perfectly in harmony with the evolutionary test:\nStrangle the new race now, and ours survives; help the new race, and it\nsurvives.  In both cases the action is right as measured by the\nevolutionary standard,--it is action for the winning side.\nThus the evolutionist foundation of ethics is purely objective only to\nthe herd of nullities whose votes count for zero in the march of\nevents.  But for others, leaders of opinion or potentates, and in\ngeneral those to whose actions position or genius gives a far-reaching\nimport, and to the rest of us, each in his measure,--whenever we\nespouse a cause we contribute to the determination of the evolutionary\nstandard of right.  The truly wise disciple of this school will then\nadmit faith as an ultimate ethical factor.  Any philosophy which makes\nsuch questions as, What is the ideal type of humanity?  What shall be\nreckoned virtues?  What conduct is good? depend on the question, What\nis going to succeed?--must needs fall back on personal belief as one of\nthe ultimate conditions of the truth.  For again and again success\ndepends on energy of act; energy again depends on faith that we shall\nnot fail; and that faith in turn on the faith that we are right,--which\nfaith thus verifies itself.\nTake as an example the question of optimism or pessimism, which makes\nso much noise just now in Germany.  Every human being must sometime\ndecide for himself whether life is worth living.  Suppose that in\nlooking at the world and seeing how full it is of misery, of old age,\nof wickedness and {101} pain, and how unsafe is his own future, he\nyields to the pessimistic conclusion, cultivates disgust and dread,\nceases striving, and finally commits suicide.  He thus adds to the mass\n_M_ of mundane phenomena, independent of his subjectivity, the\nsubjective complement _x_, which makes of the whole an utterly black\npicture illumined by no gleam of good.  Pessimism completed, verified\nby his moral reaction and the deed in which this ends, is true beyond a\ndoubt.  _M_ + _x_ expresses a state of things totally bad.  The man's\nbelief supplied all that was lacking to make it so, and now that it is\nmade so the belief was right.\nBut now suppose that with the same evil facts _M_, the man's reaction\n_x_ is exactly reversed; suppose that instead of giving way to the evil\nhe braves it, and finds a sterner, more wonderful joy than any passive\npleasure can yield in triumphing over pain and defying fear; suppose he\ndoes this successfully, and however thickly evils crowd upon him proves\nhis dauntless subjectivity to be more than their match,--will not every\none confess that the bad character of the _M_ is here the _conditio\nsine qua non_ of the good character of the _x_?  Will not every one\ninstantly declare a world fitted only for fair-weather human beings\nsusceptible of every passive enjoyment, but without independence,\ncourage, or fortitude, to be from a moral point of view incommensurably\ninferior to a world framed to elicit from the man every form of\ntriumphant endurance and conquering moral energy?  As James Hinton\nsays,--\n\"Little inconveniences, exertions, pains.--these are the only things in\nwhich we rightly feel our life at all.  If these be not there,\nexistence becomes worthless, or worse; {102} success in putting them\nall away is fatal.  So it is men engage in athletic sports, spend their\nholidays in climbing up mountains, find nothing so enjoyable as that\nwhich taxes their endurance and their energy.  This is the way we are\nmade, I say.  It may or may not be a mystery or a paradox; it is a\nfact.  Now, this enjoyment in endurance is just according to the\nintensity of life: the more physical vigor and balance, the more\nendurance can be made an element of satisfaction.  A sick man cannot\nstand it.  The line of enjoyable suffering is not a fixed one; it\nfluctuates with the perfectness of the life.  That our pains are, as\nthey are, unendurable, awful, overwhelming, crushing, not to be borne\nsave in misery and dumb impatience, which utter exhaustion alone makes\npatient,--that our pains are thus unendurable, means not that they are\ntoo great, but that _we are sick_.  We have not got our proper life.\nSo you perceive pain is no more necessarily an evil, but an essential\nelement of the highest good.\"[3]\nBut the highest good can be achieved only by our getting our proper\nlife; and that can come about only by help of a moral energy born of\nthe faith that in some way or other we shall succeed in getting it if\nwe try pertinaciously enough.  This world _is_ good, we must say, since\nit is what we make it,--and we shall make it good.  How can we exclude\nfrom the cognition of a truth a faith which is involved in the creation\nof the truth?  _M_ has its character indeterminate, susceptible of\nforming part of a thorough-going pessimism on the one hand, or of a\nmeliorism, a moral (as distinguished from a sensual) optimism on the\nother.  All depends on the character of the {103} personal contribution\n_x_.  Wherever the facts to be formulated contain such a contribution,\nwe may logically, legitimately, and inexpugnably believe what we\ndesire.  The belief creates its verification.  The thought becomes\nliterally father to the fact, as the wish was father to the thought.[4]\nLet us now turn to the radical question of life,--the question whether\nthis be at bottom a moral or an unmoral universe,--and see whether the\nmethod of faith may legitimately have a place there.  It is really the\nquestion of materialism.  Is the world a simple brute actuality, an\nexistence _de facto_ about which the deepest thing that can be said is\nthat it happens so to be; or is the judgment of _better_ or worse, of\n_ought_, as intimately pertinent to phenomena as the simple judgment\n_is_ or _is not_?  The materialistic theorists say that judgments of\nworth are themselves mere matters of fact; that the words 'good' and\n'bad' have no sense apart from subjective passions and interests which\nwe may, if we please, play fast and loose with at will, so far as any\nduty of ours to the non-human universe is concerned.  Thus, when a\nmaterialist says it is better for him to suffer great inconvenience\nthan to break a promise, he only means that his social interests have\nbecome so knit up with {104} keeping faith that, those interests once\nbeing granted, it is better for him to keep the promise in spite of\neverything.  But the interests themselves are neither right nor wrong,\nexcept possibly with reference to some ulterior order of interests\nwhich themselves again are mere subjective data without character,\neither good or bad.\nFor the absolute moralists, on the contrary, the interests are not\nthere merely to be felt,--they are to be believed in and obeyed.  Not\nonly is it best for my social interests to keep my promise, but best\nfor me to have those interests, and best for the cosmos to have this\nme.  Like the old woman in the story who described the world as resting\non a rock, and then explained that rock to be supported by another\nrock, and finally when pushed with questions said it was rocks all the\nway down,--he who believes this to be a radically moral universe must\nhold the moral order to rest either on an absolute and ultimate\n_should_, or on a series of _shoulds_ all the way down.[5]\nThe practical difference between this objective sort of moralist and\nthe other one is enormous.  The subjectivist in morals, when his moral\nfeelings are at war with the facts about him, is always free to seek\nharmony by toning down the sensitiveness of the feelings.  Being mere\ndata, neither good nor evil in themselves, he may pervert them or lull\nthem to sleep by any means at his command.  Truckling, compromise,\ntime-serving, capitulations of conscience, are conventionally\nopprobrious names for what, if successfully carried out, {105} would be\non his principles by far the easiest and most praiseworthy mode of\nbringing about that harmony between inner and outer relations which is\nall that he means by good.  The absolute moralist, on the other hand,\nwhen his interests clash with the world, is not free to gain harmony by\nsacrificing the ideal interests.  According to him, these latter should\nbe as they are and not otherwise.  Resistance then, poverty, martyrdom\nif need be, tragedy in a word,--such are the solemn feasts of his\ninward faith.  Not that the contradiction between the two men occurs\nevery day; in commonplace matters all moral schools agree.  It is only\nin the lonely emergencies of life that our creed is tested: then\nroutine maxims fail, and we fall back on our gods.  It cannot then be\nsaid that the question, Is this a moral world? is a meaningless and\nunverifiable question because it deals with something non-phenomenal.\nAny question is full of meaning to which, as here, contrary answers\nlead to contrary behavior.  And it seems as if in answering such a\nquestion as this we might proceed exactly as does the physical\nphilosopher in testing an hypothesis.  He deduces from the hypothesis\nan experimental action, _x_; this he adds to the facts _M_ already\nexisting.  It fits them if the hypothesis be true; if not, there is\ndiscord.  The results of the action corroborate or refute the idea from\nwhich it flowed.  So here: the verification of the theory which you may\nhold as to the objectively moral character of the world can consist\nonly in this,--that if you proceed to act upon your theory it will be\nreversed by nothing that later turns up as your action's fruit; it will\nharmonize so well with the entire drift of experience that the latter\nwill, as it were, adopt it, or at most give it an ampler {106}\ninterpretation, without obliging you in any way to change the essence\nof its formulation.  If this be an objectively moral universe, all acts\nthat I make on that assumption, all expectations that I ground on it,\nwill tend more and more completely to interdigitate with the phenomena\nalready existing.  _M_ + _x_ will be in accord; and the more I live,\nand the more the fruits of my activity come to light, the more\nsatisfactory the consensus will grow.  While if it be not such a moral\nuniverse, and I mistakenly assume that it is, the course of experience\nwill throw ever new impediments in the way of my belief, and become\nmore and more difficult to express in its language.  Epicycle upon\nepicycle of subsidiary hypothesis will have to be invoked to give to\nthe discrepant terms a temporary appearance of squaring with each\nother; but at last even this resource will fail.\nIf, on the other hand, I rightly assume the universe to be not moral,\nin what does my verification consist?  It is that by letting moral\ninterests sit lightly, by disbelieving that there is any duty about\n_them_ (since duty obtains only as _between_ them and other phenomena),\nand so throwing them over if I find it hard to get them satisfied,--it\nis that by refusing to take up a tragic attitude, I deal in the\nlong-run most satisfactorily with the facts of life.  \"All is vanity\"\nis here the last word of wisdom.  Even though in certain limited series\nthere may be a great appearance of seriousness, he who in the main\ntreats things with a degree of good-natured scepticism and radical\nlevity will find that the practical fruits of his epicurean hypothesis\nverify it more and more, and not only save him from pain but do honor\nto his sagacity.  While, on the other hand, he who contrary {107} to\nreality stiffens himself in the notion that certain things absolutely\nshould be, and rejects the truth that at bottom it makes no difference\nwhat is, will find himself evermore thwarted and perplexed and\nbemuddled by the facts of the world, and his tragic disappointment\nwill, as experience accumulates, seem to drift farther and farther away\nfrom that final atonement or reconciliation which certain partial\ntragedies often get.\n_Anaesthesia_ is the watchword of the moral sceptic brought to bay and\nput to his trumps.  _Energy_ is that of the moralist.  Act on my creed,\ncries the latter, and the results of your action will prove the creed\ntrue, and that the nature of things is earnest infinitely.  Act on\nmine, says the epicurean, and the results will prove that seriousness\nis but a superficial glaze upon a world of fundamentally trivial\nimport.  You and your acts and the nature of things will be alike\nenveloped in a single formula, a universal _vanitas vanitatum_.\nFor the sake of simplicity I have written as if the verification might\noccur in the life of a single philosopher,--which is manifestly untrue,\nsince the theories still face each other, and the facts of the world\ngive countenance to both.  Rather should we expect, that, in a question\nof this scope, the experience of the entire human race must make the\nverification, and that all the evidence will not be 'in' till the final\nintegration of things, when the last man has had his say and\ncontributed his share to the still unfinished _x_.  Then the proof will\nbe complete; then it will appear without doubt whether the moralistic x\nhas filled up the gap which alone kept the _M_ of the world from\nforming an even and harmonious unity, or whether the {108}\nnon-moralistic _x_ has given the finishing touches which were alone\nneeded to make the _M_ appear outwardly as vain as it inwardly was.\nBut if this be so, is it not clear that the facts _M_, taken _per se_,\nare inadequate to justify a conclusion either way in advance of my\naction?  My action is the complement which, by proving congruous or\nnot, reveals the latent nature of the mass to which it is applied.  The\nworld may in fact be likened unto a lock, whose inward nature, moral or\nunmoral, will never reveal itself to our simply expectant gaze.  The\npositivists, forbidding us to make any assumptions regarding it,\ncondemn us to eternal ignorance, for the 'evidence' which they wait for\ncan never come so long as we are passive.  But nature has put into our\nhands two keys, by which we may test the lock.  If we try the moral key\n_and it fits_, it is a moral lock.  If we try the unmoral key and _it_\nfits, it is an unmoral lock.  I cannot possibly conceive of any other\nsort of 'evidence' or 'proof' than this.  It is quite true that the\nco-operation of generations is needed to educe it.  But in these\nmatters the solidarity (so called) of the human race is a patent fact.\nThe essential thing to notice is that our active preference is a\nlegitimate part of the game,--that it is our plain business as men to\ntry one of the keys, and the one in which we most confide.  If then the\nproof exist not till I have acted, and I must needs in acting run the\nrisk of being wrong, how can the popular science professors be right in\nobjurgating in me as infamous a 'credulity' which the strict logic of\nthe situation requires?  If this really be a moral universe; if by my\nacts I be a factor of its destinies; if to believe where I may doubt be\nitself a moral act {109} analogous to voting for a side not yet sure to\nwin,--by what right shall they close in upon me and steadily negate the\ndeepest conceivable function of my being by their preposterous command\nthat I shall stir neither hand nor foot, but remain balancing myself in\neternal and insoluble doubt?  Why, doubt itself is a decision of the\nwidest practical reach, if only because we may miss by doubting what\ngoods we might be gaining by espousing the winning side.  But more than\nthat! it is often practically impossible to distinguish doubt from\ndogmatic negation.  If I refuse to stop a murder because I am in doubt\nwhether it be not justifiable homicide, I am virtually abetting the\ncrime.  If I refuse to bale out a boat because I am in doubt whether my\nefforts will keep her afloat, I am really helping to sink her.  If in\nthe mountain precipice I doubt my right to risk a leap, I actively\nconnive at my destruction.  He who commands himself not to be credulous\nof God, of duty, of freedom, of immortality, may again and again be\nindistinguishable from him who dogmatically denies them.  Scepticism in\nmoral matters is an active ally of immorality.  Who is not for is\nagainst.  The universe will have no neutrals in these questions.  In\ntheory as in practice, dodge or hedge, or talk as we like about a wise\nscepticism, we are really doing volunteer military service for one side\nor the other.\nYet obvious as this necessity practically is, thousands of innocent\nmagazine readers lie paralyzed and terrified in the network of shallow\nnegations which the leaders of opinion have thrown over their souls.\nAll they need to be free and hearty again in the exercise of their\nbirthright is that these fastidious vetoes should be swept away.  All\nthat the human {110} heart wants is its chance.  It will willingly\nforego certainty in universal matters if only it can be allowed to feel\nthat in them it has that same inalienable right to run risks, which no\none dreams of refusing to it in the pettiest practical affairs.  And if\nI, in these last pages, like the mouse in the fable, have gnawed a few\nof the strings of the sophistical net that has been binding down its\nlion-strength, I shall be more than rewarded for my pains.\nTo sum up: No philosophy will permanently be deemed rational by all men\nwhich (in addition to meeting logical demands) does not to some degree\npretend to determine expectancy, and in a still greater degree make a\ndirect appeal to all those powers of our nature which we hold in\nhighest esteem.  Faith, being one of these powers, will always remain a\nfactor not to be banished from philosophic constructions, the more so\nsince in many ways it brings forth its own verification.  In these\npoints, then, it is hopeless to look for literal agreement among\nmankind.\nThe ultimate philosophy, we may therefore conclude, must not be too\nstrait-laced in form, must not in all its parts divide heresy from\northodoxy by too sharp a line.  There must be left over and above the\npropositions to be subscribed, _ubique, semper, et ab omnibus_, another\nrealm into which the stifled soul may escape from pedantic scruples and\nindulge its own faith at its own risks; and all that can here be done\nwill be to mark out distinctly the questions which fall within faith's\nsphere.\n[1] This essay as far as page 75 consists of extracts from an article\nprinted in Mind for July, 1879.  Thereafter it is a reprint of an\naddress to the Harvard Philosophical Club, delivered in 1880, and\npublished in the Princeton Review, July, 1882.\n[2] At most, the command laid upon us by science to believe nothing not\nyet verified by the senses is a prudential rule intended to maximize\nour right thinking and minimize our errors _in the long run_.  In the\nparticular instance we must frequently lose truth by obeying it; but on\nthe whole we are safer if we follow it consistently, for we are sure to\ncover our losses with our gains.  It is like those gambling and\ninsurance rules based on probability, in which we secure ourselves\nagainst losses in detail by hedging on the total run.  But this hedging\nphilosophy requires that long run should be there; and this makes it\ninapplicable to the question of religious faith as the latter comes\nhome to the individual man.  He plays the game of life not to escape\nlosses, for he brings nothing with him to lose; he plays it for gains;\nand it is now or never with him, for the long run which exists indeed\nfor humanity, is not there for him.  Let him doubt, believe, or deny,\nhe runs his risk, and has the natural right to choose which one it\nshall be.\n[3] Life of James Hinton, pp. 172, 173.  See also the excellent chapter\non Faith and Sight in the Mystery of Matter, by J. Allanson Picton.\nHinton's Mystery of Pain will undoubtedly always remain the classical\nutterance on this subject.\n[4] Observe that in all this not a word has been said of free-will.  It\nall applies as well to a predetermined as to an indeterminate universe.\nIf _M_ + _x_ is fixed in advance, the belief which leads to _x_ and the\ndesire which prompts the belief are also fixed.  But fixed or not,\nthese subjective states form a phenomenal condition necessarily\npreceding the facts; necessarily constitutive, therefore, of the truth\n_M_ + _x_ which we seek.  If, however, free acts be possible, a faith\nin their possibility, by augmenting the moral energy which gives them\nbirth, will increase their frequency in a given individual.\n[5] In either case, as a later essay explains (see p. 193), the\n_should_ which the moralist regards as binding upon him must be rooted\nin the feeling of some other thinker, or collection of thinkers, to\nwhose demands he individually bows.\n{111}\nREFLEX ACTION AND THEISM.[1]\nMEMBERS OF THE MINISTERS' INSTITUTE:\nLet me confess to the diffidence with which I find myself standing here\nto-day.  When the invitation of your committee reached me last fall,\nthe simple truth is that I accepted it as most men accept a\nchallenge,--not because they wish to fight, but because they are\nashamed to say no.  Pretending in my small sphere to be a teacher, I\nfelt it would be cowardly to shrink from the keenest ordeal to which a\nteacher can be exposed,--the ordeal of teaching other teachers.\nFortunately, the trial will last but one short hour; and I have the\nconsolation of remembering Goethe's verses,--\n\"Vor den Wissenden sich stellen,\nSicher ist 's in allen F\u00e4llen,\"--\nfor if experts are the hardest people to satisfy, they have at any rate\nthe liveliest sense of the difficulties of one's task, and they know\nquickest when one hits the mark.\nSince it was as a teacher of physiology that I was most unworthily\nofficiating when your committee's {112} invitation reached me, I must\nsuppose it to be for the sake of bringing a puff of the latest winds of\ndoctrine which blow over that somewhat restless sea that my presence is\ndesired.  Among all the healthy symptoms that characterize this age, I\nknow no sounder one than the eagerness which theologians show to\nassimilate results of science, and to hearken to the conclusions of men\nof science about universal matters.  One runs a better chance of being\nlistened to to-day if one can quote Darwin and Helmholtz than if one\ncan only quote Schleiermacher or Coleridge.  I almost feel myself this\nmoment that were I to produce a frog and put him through his\nphysiological performances in a masterly manner before your eyes, I\nshould gain more reverential ears for what I have to say during the\nremainder of the hour.  I will not ask whether there be not something\nof mere fashion in this prestige which the words of the physiologists\nenjoy just now.  If it be a fashion, it is certainly a beneficial one\nupon the whole; and to challenge it would come with a poor grace from\none who at the moment he speaks is so conspicuously profiting by its\nfavors.\nI will therefore only say this: that the latest breeze from the\nphysiological horizon need not necessarily be the most important one.\nOf the immense amount of work which the laboratories of Europe and\nAmerica, and one may add of Asia and Australia, are producing every\nyear, much is destined to speedy refutation; and of more it may be said\nthat its interest is purely technical, and not in any degree\nphilosophical or universal.\nThis being the case, I know you will justify me if I fall back on a\ndoctrine which is fundamental and well established rather than novel,\nand ask you whether {113} by taking counsel together we may not trace\nsome new consequences from it which shall interest us all alike as men.\nI refer to the doctrine of reflex action, especially as extended to the\nbrain.  This is, of course, so familiar to you that I hardly need\ndefine it.  In a general way, all educated people know what reflex\naction means.\nIt means that the acts we perform are always the result of outward\ndischarges from the nervous centres, and that these outward discharges\nare themselves the result of impressions from the external world,\ncarried in along one or another of our sensory nerves.  Applied at\nfirst to only a portion of our acts, this conception has ended by being\ngeneralized more and more, so that now most physiologists tell us that\nevery action whatever, even the most deliberately weighed and\ncalculated, does, so far as its organic conditions go, follow the\nreflex type.  There is not one which cannot be remotely, if not\nimmediately, traced to an origin in some incoming impression of sense.\nThere is no impression of sense which, unless inhibited by some other\nstronger one, does not immediately or remotely express itself in action\nof some kind.  There is no one of those complicated performances in the\nconvolutions of the brain to which our trains of thought correspond,\nwhich is not a mere middle term interposed between an incoming\nsensation that arouses it and an outgoing discharge of some sort,\ninhibitory if not exciting, to which itself gives rise.  The structural\nunit of the nervous system is in fact a triad, neither of whose\nelements has any independent existence.  The sensory impression exists\nonly for the sake of awaking the central process of reflection, and the\ncentral process of reflection exists {114} only for the sake of calling\nforth the final act.  All action is thus _re_-action upon the outer\nworld; and the middle stage of consideration or contemplation or\nthinking is only a place of transit, the bottom of a loop, both whose\nends have their point of application in the outer world.  If it should\never have no roots in the outer world, if it should ever happen that it\nled to no active measures, it would fail of its essential function, and\nwould have to be considered either pathological or abortive.  The\ncurrent of life which runs in at our eyes or ears is meant to run out\nat our hands, feet, or lips.  The only use of the thoughts it occasions\nwhile inside is to determine its direction to whichever of these organs\nshall, on the whole, under the circumstances actually present, act in\nthe way most propitious to our welfare.\nThe willing department of our nature, in short, dominates both the\nconceiving department and the feeling department; or, in plainer\nEnglish, perception and thinking are only there for behavior's sake.\nI am sure I am not wrong in stating this result as one of the\nfundamental conclusions to which the entire drift of modern\nphysiological investigation sweeps us.  If asked what great\ncontribution physiology has made to psychology of late years, I am sure\nevery competent authority will reply that her influence has in no way\nbeen so weighty as in the copious illustration, verification, and\nconsolidation of this broad, general point of view.\nI invite you, then, to consider what may be the possible speculative\nconsequences involved in this great achievement of our generation.\nAlready, it dominates all the new work done in psychology; but {115}\nwhat I wish to ask is whether its influence may not extend far beyond\nthe limits of psychology, even into those of theology herself.  The\nrelations of the doctrine of reflex action with no less a matter than\nthe doctrine of theism is, in fact, the topic to which I now invite\nyour attention.\nWe are not the first in the field.  There have not been wanting writers\nenough to say that reflex action and all that follows from it give the\n_coup de gr\u00e2ce_ to the superstition of a God.\nIf you open, for instance, such a book on comparative psychology, as\nder Thierische Wille of G. H. Schneider, you will find, sandwiched in\namong the admirable dealings of the author with his proper subject, and\npopping out upon us in unexpected places, the most delightfully _na\u00eff_\nGerman onslaughts on the degradation of theologians, and the utter\nincompatibility of so many reflex adaptations to the environment with\nthe existence of a creative intelligence.  There was a time, remembered\nby many of us here, when the existence of reflex action and all the\nother harmonies between the organism and the world were held to prove a\nGod.  Now, they are held to disprove him.  The next turn of the\nwhirligig may bring back proof of him again.\nInto this debate about his existence, I will not pretend to enter.  I\nmust take up humbler ground, and limit my ambition to showing that a\nGod, whether existent or not, is at all events the kind of being which,\nif he did exist, would form _the most adequate possible object_ for\nminds framed like our own to conceive as lying at the root of the\nuniverse.  My thesis, in other words, is this: that some outward\nreality of {116} a nature defined as God's nature must be defined, is\nthe only ultimate object that is at the same time rational and possible\nfor the human mind's contemplation.  _Anything short of God is not\nrational, anything more than God is not possible_, if the human mind be\nin truth the triadic structure of impression, reflection, and reaction\nwhich we at the outset allowed.\nTheism, whatever its objective warrant, would thus be seen to have a\nsubjective anchorage in its congruity with our nature as thinkers; and,\nhowever it may fare with its truth, to derive from this subjective\nadequacy the strongest possible guaranty of its permanence.  It is and\nwill be the classic mean of rational opinion, the centre of gravity of\nall attempts to solve the riddle of life,--some falling below it by\ndefect, some flying above it by excess, itself alone satisfying every\nmental need in strictly normal measure.  Our gain will thus in the\nfirst instance be psychological.  We shall merely have investigated a\nchapter in the natural history of the mind, and found that, as a matter\nof such natural history, God may be called the normal object of the\nmind's belief.  Whether over and above this he be really the living\ntruth is another question.  If he is, it will show the structure of our\nmind to be in accordance with the nature of reality.  Whether it be or\nnot in such accordance is, it seems to me, one of those questions that\nbelong to the province of personal faith to decide.  I will not touch\nupon the question here, for I prefer to keep to the strictly\nnatural-history point of view.  I will only remind you that each one of\nus is entitled either to doubt or to believe in the harmony between his\nfaculties and the truth; and that, whether he doubt or {117} believe,\nhe does it alike on his personal responsibility and risk.\n\"Du musst glauben, du musst wagen,\nDenn die G\u00f6tter leihn kein Pfand,\nNur ein Wunder kann dich tragen\nIn das sch\u00f6ne Wunderland.\"\nI will presently define exactly what I mean by God and by Theism, and\nexplain what theories I referred to when I spoke just now of attempts\nto fly beyond the one and to outbid the other.\nBut, first of all, let me ask you to linger a moment longer over what I\nhave called the reflex theory of mind, so as to be sure that we\nunderstand it absolutely before going on to consider those of its\nconsequences of which I am more particularly to speak.  I am not quite\nsure that its full scope is grasped even by those who have most\nzealously promulgated it.  I am not sure, for example, that all\nphysiologists see that it commits them to regarding the mind as an\nessentially teleological mechanism.  I mean by this that the conceiving\nor theorizing faculty--the mind's middle department--functions\n_exclusively for the sake of ends_ that do not exist at all in the\nworld of impressions we receive by way of our senses, but are set by\nour emotional and practical subjectivity altogether.[2]  It is a\ntransformer of the world of our impressions into a totally different\nworld,--the world of our conception; and the transformation is effected\nin the interests of our volitional nature, and for no other purpose\nwhatsoever.  Destroy the volitional nature, the definite subjective\npurposes, preferences, {118} fondnesses for certain effects, forms,\norders, and not the slightest motive would remain for the brute order\nof our experience to be remodelled at all.  But, as we have the\nelaborate volitional constitution we do have, the remodelling must be\neffected; there is no escape.  The world's contents are _given_ to each\nof us in an order so foreign to our subjective interests that we can\nhardly by an effort of the imagination picture to ourselves what it is\nlike.  We have to break that order altogether,--and by picking out from\nit the items which concern us, and connecting them with others far\naway, which we say 'belong' with them, we are able to make out definite\nthreads of sequence and tendency; to foresee particular liabilities and\nget ready for them; and to enjoy simplicity and harmony in place of\nwhat was chaos.  Is not the sum of your actual experience taken at this\nmoment and impartially added together an utter chaos?  The strains of\nmy voice, the lights and shades inside the room and out, the murmur of\nthe wind, the ticking of the clock, the various organic feelings you\nmay happen individually to possess, do these make a whole at all?  Is\nit not the only condition of your mental sanity in the midst of them\nthat most of them should become non-existent for you, and that a few\nothers--the sounds, I hope, which I am uttering--should evoke from\nplaces in your memory that have nothing to do with this scene\nassociates fitted to combine with them in what we call a rational train\nof thought,--rational, because it leads to a conclusion which we have\nsome organ to appreciate?  We have no organ or faculty to appreciate\nthe simply given order.  The real world as it is given objectively at\nthis moment is the sum total of all its beings and {119} events now.\nBut can we think of such a sum?  Can we realize for an instant what a\ncross-section of all existence at a definite point of time would be?\nWhile I talk and the flies buzz, a sea-gull catches a fish at the mouth\nof the Amazon, a tree falls in the Adirondack wilderness, a man sneezes\nin Germany, a horse dies in Tartary, and twins are born in France.\nWhat does that mean?  Does the contemporaneity of these events with one\nanother and with a million others as disjointed, form a rational bond\nbetween them, and unite them into anything that means for us a world?\nYet just such a collateral contemporaneity, and nothing else, is the\nreal order of the world.  It is an order with which we have nothing to\ndo but to get away from it as fast as possible.  As I said, we break\nit: we break it into histories, and we break it into arts, and we break\nit into sciences; and then we begin to feel at home.  We make ten\nthousand separate serial orders of it, and on any one of these we react\nas though the others did not exist.  We discover among its various\nparts relations that were never given to sense at all (mathematical\nrelations, tangents, squares, and roots and logarithmic functions), and\nout of an infinite number of these we call certain ones essential and\nlawgiving, and ignore the rest.  Essential these relations are, but\nonly _for our purpose_, the other relations being just as real and\npresent as they; and our purpose is to _conceive simply_ and to\n_foresee_.  Are not simple conception and prevision subjective ends\npure and simple?  They are the ends of what we call science; and the\nmiracle of miracles, a miracle not yet exhaustively cleared up by any\nphilosophy, is that the given order lends itself to the remodelling.\nIt shows itself plastic to many of our scientific, to {120} many of our\naesthetic, to many of our practical purposes and ends.\nWhen the man of affairs, the artist, or the man of science fails, he is\nnot rebutted.  He tries again.  He says the impressions of sense _must_\ngive way, _must_ be reduced to the desiderated form.[3]  They all\npostulate in the interests of their volitional nature a harmony between\nthe latter and the nature of things.  The theologian does no more.  And\nthe reflex doctrine of the mind's structure, though all theology should\nas yet have failed of its endeavor, could but confess that the endeavor\nitself at least obeyed in form the mind's most necessary law.[4]\nNow for the question I asked above: What kind of a being would God be\nif he did exist?  The word 'God' has come to mean many things in the\nhistory {121} of human thought, from Venus and Jupiter to the 'Idee'\nwhich figures in the pages of Hegel.  Even the laws of physical nature\nhave, in these positivistic times, been held worthy of divine honor and\npresented as the only fitting object of our reverence.[5]  Of course,\nif our discussion is to bear any fruit, we must mean something more\ndefinite than this.  We must not call any object of our loyalty a 'God'\nwithout more ado, simply because to awaken our loyalty happens to be\none of God's functions.  He must have some intrinsic characteristics of\nhis own besides; and theism must mean the faith of that man who\nbelieves that the object of _his_ loyalty has those other attributes,\nnegative or positive, as the case may be.\nNow, as regards a great many of the attributes of God, and their\namounts and mutual relations, the world has been delivered over to\ndisputes.  All such may for our present purpose be considered as quite\ninessential.  Not only such matters as his mode of revealing himself,\nthe precise extent of his providence and power and their connection\nwith our free-will, the proportion of his mercy to his justice, and the\namount of his responsibility for evil; but also his metaphysical\nrelation to the phenomenal world, whether causal, substantial, ideal,\nor what not,--are affairs of purely sectarian opinion that need not\nconcern us at all.  Whoso debates them presupposes the essential\nfeatures of theism to be granted already; and it is with these\nessential features, the bare poles of the subject, that our business\nexclusively lies.\n{122}\nNow, what are these essential features?  First, it is essential that\nGod be conceived as the deepest power in the universe; and, second, he\nmust be conceived under the form of a mental personality.  The\npersonality need not be determined intrinsically any further than is\ninvolved in the holding of certain things dear, and in the recognition\nof our dispositions toward those things, the things themselves being\nall good and righteous things.  But, extrinsically considered, so to\nspeak, God's personality is to be regarded, like any other personality,\nas something lying outside of my own and other than me, and whose\nexistence I simply come upon and find.  A power not ourselves, then,\nwhich not only makes for righteousness, but means it, and which\nrecognizes us,--such is the definition which I think nobody will be\ninclined to dispute.  Various are the attempts to shadow forth the\nother lineaments of so supreme a personality to our human imagination;\nvarious the ways of conceiving in what mode the recognition, the\nhearkening to our cry, can come.  Some are gross and idolatrous; some\nare the most sustained efforts man's intellect has ever made to keep\nstill living on that subtile edge of things where speech and thought\nexpire.  But, with all these differences, the essence remains\nunchanged.  In whatever other respects the divine personality may\ndiffer from ours or may resemble it, the two are consanguineous at\nleast in this,--that both have purposes for which they care, and each\ncan hear the other's call.\nMeanwhile, we can already see one consequence and one point of\nconnection with the reflex-action theory of mind.  Any mind,\nconstructed on the {123} triadic-reflex pattern, must first get its\nimpression from the object which it confronts; then define what that\nobject is, and decide what active measures its presence demands; and\nfinally react.  The stage of reaction depends on the stage of\ndefinition, and these, of course, on the nature of the impressing\nobject.  When the objects are concrete, particular, and familiar, our\nreactions are firm and certain enough,--often instinctive.  I see the\ndesk, and lean on it; I see your quiet faces, and I continue to talk.\nBut the objects will not stay concrete and particular: they fuse\nthemselves into general essences, and they sum themselves into a\nwhole,--the universe.  And then the object that confronts us, that\nknocks on our mental door and asks to be let in, and fixed and decided\nupon and actively met, is just this whole universe itself and its\nessence.\nWhat are _they_, and how shall I meet _them_?\nThe whole flood of faiths and systems here rush in.  Philosophies and\ndenials of philosophy, religions and atheisms, scepticisms and\nmysticisms, confirmed emotional moods and habitual practical biases,\njostle one another; for all are alike trials, hasty, prolix, or of\nseemly length, to answer this momentous question.  And the function of\nthem all, long or short, that which the moods and the systems alike\nsubserve and pass into, is the third stage,--the stage of action.  For\nno one of them itself is final.  They form but the middle segment of\nthe mental curve, and not its termination.  As the last theoretic pulse\ndies away, it does not leave the mental process complete: it is but the\nforerunner of the practical moment, in which alone the cycle of\nmentality finds its rhythmic pause.\n{124}\nWe easily delude ourselves about this middle stage.  Sometimes we think\nit final, and sometimes we fail to see, amid the monstrous diversity in\nthe length and complication of the cogitations which may fill it, that\nit can have but one essential function, and that the one we have\npointed out,--the function of defining the direction which our\nactivity, immediate or remote, shall take.\nIf I simply say, \"Vanitas vanitatum, omnia vanitas!\" I am defining the\ntotal nature of things in a way that carries practical consequences\nwith it as decidedly as if I write a treatise De Natura Rerum in twenty\nvolumes.  The treatise may trace its consequences more minutely than\nthe saying; but the only worth of either treatise or saying is that the\nconsequences are there.  The long definition can do no more than draw\nthem; the short definition does no less.  Indeed, it may be said that\nif two apparently different definitions of the reality before us should\nhave identical consequences, those two definitions would really be\nidentical definitions, made delusively to appear different merely by\nthe different verbiage in which they are expressed.[6]\nMy time is unfortunately too short to stay and give to this truth the\ndevelopment it deserves; but I will assume that you grant it without\nfurther parley, and pass to the next step in my argument.  And here,\ntoo, I shall have to bespeak your close attention for a moment, while I\npass over the subject far more {125} rapidly than it deserves.  Whether\ntrue or false, any view of the universe which shall completely satisfy\nthe mind must obey conditions of the mind's own imposing, must at least\nlet the mind be the umpire to decide whether it be fit to be called a\nrational universe or not.  Not any nature of things which may seem to\nbe will also seem to be _ipso facto_ rational; and if it do not seem\nrational, it will afflict the mind with a ceaseless uneasiness, till it\nbe formulated or interpreted in some other and more congenial way.  The\nstudy of what the mind's criteria of rationality are, the definition of\nits exactions in this respect, form an intensely interesting subject\ninto which I cannot enter now with any detail.[7]  But so much I think\nyou will grant me without argument,--that all three departments of the\nmind alike have a vote in the matter, and that no conception will pass\nmuster which violates any of their essential modes of activity, or\nwhich leaves them without a chance to work.  By what title is it that\nevery would-be universal formula, every system of philosophy which\nrears its head, receives the inevitable critical volley from one half\nof mankind, and falls to the rear, to become at the very best the creed\nof some partial sect?  Either it has dropped out of its net some of our\nimpressions of sense,--what we call the facts of nature,--or it has\nleft the theoretic and defining department with a lot of\ninconsistencies and unmediated transitions on its hands; or else,\nfinally, it has left some one or more of our fundamental active and\nemotional powers with no object outside of themselves to react-on or to\nlive for.  Any one of these defects is fatal to its complete success.\nSome one {126} will be sure to discover the flaw, to scout the system,\nand to seek another in its stead.\nI need not go far to collect examples to illustrate to an audience of\ntheologians what I mean.  Nor will you in particular, as champions of\nthe Unitarianism of New England, be slow to furnish, from the motives\nwhich led to your departure from our orthodox ancestral Calvinism,\ninstances enough under the third or practical head.  A God who gives so\nlittle scope to love, a predestination which takes from endeavor all\nits zest with all its fruit, are irrational conceptions, because they\nsay to our most cherished powers, There is no object for you.\nWell, just as within the limits of theism some kinds are surviving\nothers by reason of their greater practical rationality, so theism\nitself, by reason of its practical rationality, is certain to survive\nall lower creeds.  Materialism and agnosticism, even were they true,\ncould never gain universal and popular acceptance; for they both,\nalike, give a solution of things which is irrational to the practical\nthird of our nature, and in which we can never volitionally feel at\nhome.  Each comes out of the second or theoretic stage of mental\nfunctioning, with its definition of the essential nature of things, its\nformula of formulas prepared.  The whole array of active forces of our\nnature stands waiting, impatient for the word which shall tell them how\nto discharge themselves most deeply and worthily upon life.  \"Well!\"\ncry they, \"what shall we do?\"  \"Ignoramus, ignorabimus!\" says\nagnosticism.  \"React upon atoms and their concussions!\" says\nmaterialism.  What a collapse!  The mental train misses fire, the\nmiddle fails to ignite the end, the cycle breaks down half-way to its\nconclusion; and the active {127} powers left alone, with no proper\nobject on which to vent their energy, must either atrophy, sicken, and\ndie, or else by their pent-up convulsions and excitement keep the whole\nmachinery in a fever until some less incommensurable solution, some\nmore practically rational formula, shall provide a normal issue for the\ncurrents of the soul.\nNow, theism always stands ready with the most practically rational\nsolution it is possible to conceive.  Not an energy of our active\nnature to which it does not authoritatively appeal, not an emotion of\nwhich it does not normally and naturally release the springs.  At a\nsingle stroke, it changes the dead blank _it_ of the world into a\nliving _thou_, with whom the whole man may have dealings.  To you, at\nany rate, I need waste no words in trying to prove its supreme\ncommensurateness with all the demands that department Number Three of\nthe mind has the power to impose on department Number Two.\nOur volitional nature must then, until the end of time, exert a\nconstant pressure upon the other departments of the mind to induce them\nto function to theistic conclusions.  No contrary formulas can be more\nthan provisionally held.  Infra-theistic theories must be always in\nunstable equilibrium; for department Number Three ever lurks in ambush,\nready to assert its rights, and on the slightest show of justification\nit makes its fatal spring, and converts them into the other form in\nwhich alone mental peace and order can permanently reign.\nThe question is, then, _Can_ departments One and Two, _can_ the facts\nof nature and the theoretic elaboration of them, always lead to\ntheistic conclusions?\nThe future history of philosophy is the only {128} authority capable of\nanswering that question.  I, at all events, must not enter into it\nto-day, as that would be to abandon the purely natural-history point of\nview I mean to keep.\nThis only is certain, that the theoretic faculty lives between two\nfires which never give her rest, and make her incessantly revise her\nformulations.  If she sink into a premature, short-sighted, and\nidolatrous theism, in comes department Number One with its battery of\nfacts of sense, and dislodges her from her dogmatic repose.  If she\nlazily subside into equilibrium with the same facts of sense viewed in\ntheir simple mechanical outwardness, up starts the practical reason\nwith its demands, and makes _that_ couch a bed of thorns.  From\ngeneration to generation thus it goes,--now a movement of reception\nfrom without, now one of expansion from within; department Number Two\nalways worked to death, yet never excused from taking the most\nresponsible part in the arrangements.  To-day, a crop of new facts;\nto-morrow, a flowering of new motives,--the theoretic faculty always\nhaving to effect the transition, and life growing withal so complex and\nsubtle and immense that her powers of conceiving are almost ruptured\nwith the strain.  See how, in France, the mummy-cloths of the academic\nand official theistic philosophy are rent by the facts of evolution,\nand how the young thinkers are at work!  See, in Great Britain, how the\ndryness of the strict associationist school, which under the\nministration of Mill, Bain, and Spencer dominated us but yesterday,\ngives way to more generous idealisms, born of more urgent emotional\nneeds and wrapping the same facts in far more massive intellectual\nharmonies!  These are but tackings to the common {129} port, to that\nultimate _Weltanschauung_ of maximum subjective as well as objective\nrichness, which, whatever its other properties may be, will at any rate\nwear the theistic form.\nHere let me say one word about a remark we often hear coming from the\nanti-theistic wing: It is base, it is vile, it is the lowest depth of\nimmorality, to allow department Number Three to interpose its demands,\nand have any vote in the question of what is true and what is false;\nthe mind must be a passive, reactionless sheet of white paper, on which\nreality will simply come and register its own philosophic definition,\nas the pen registers the curve on the sheet of a chronograph.  \"Of all\nthe cants that are canted in this canting age\" this has always seemed\nto me the most wretched, especially when it comes from professed\npsychologists.  As if the mind could, consistently with its definition,\nbe a reactionless sheet at all!  As if conception could possibly occur\nexcept for a teleological purpose, except to show us the way from a\nstate of things our senses cognize to another state of things our will\ndesires!  As if 'science' itself were anything else than such an end of\ndesire, and a most peculiar one at that!  And as if the 'truths' of\nbare physics in particular, which these sticklers for intellectual\npurity contend to be the only uncontaminated form, were not as great an\nalteration and falsification of the simply 'given' order of the world,\ninto an order conceived solely for the mind's convenience and delight,\nas any theistic doctrine possibly can be!\nPhysics is but one chapter in the great jugglery which our conceiving\nfaculty is forever playing with {130} the order of being as it presents\nitself to our reception.  It transforms the unutterable dead level and\ncontinuum of the 'given' world into an utterly unlike world of sharp\ndifferences and hierarchic subordinations for no other reason than to\nsatisfy certain subjective passions we possess.[8]\nAnd, so far as we can see, the given world is there only for the sake\nof the operation.  At any rate, to operate upon it is our only chance\nof approaching it; for never can we get a glimpse of it in the\nunimaginable insipidity of its virgin estate.  To bid the man's\nsubjective interests be passive till truth express itself from out the\nenvironment, is to bid the sculptor's chisel be passive till the statue\nexpress itself from out the stone.  Operate we must! and the only\nchoice left us is that between operating to poor or to rich results.\nThe only possible duty there can be in the matter is the duty of\ngetting the richest results that the material given will allow.  The\nrichness lies, of course, in the energy of all three departments of the\nmental cycle.  Not a sensible 'fact' of department One must be left in\nthe cold, not a faculty of department Three be paralyzed; and\ndepartment Two must form an indestructible bridge.  It is natural that\nthe habitual neglect of department One by theologians should arouse\nindignation; but it is most _un_natural that the indignation should\ntake the form of a wholesale denunciation of department Three.  It is\nthe story of Kant's dove over again, denouncing the {131} pressure of\nthe air.  Certain of our positivists keep chiming to us, that, amid the\nwreck of every other god and idol, one divinity still stands\nupright,--that his name is Scientific Truth, and that he has but one\ncommandment, but that one supreme, saying, _Thou shalt not be a\ntheist_, for that would be to satisfy thy subjective propensities, and\nthe satisfaction of those is intellectual damnation.  These most\nconscientious gentlemen think they have jumped off their own\nfeet,--emancipated their mental operations from the control of their\nsubjective propensities at large and _in toto_.  But they are deluded.\nThey have simply chosen from among the entire set of propensities at\ntheir command those that were certain to construct, out of the\nmaterials given, the leanest, lowest, aridest result,--namely, the bare\nmolecular world,--and they have sacrificed all the rest.[9]\nMan's chief difference from the brutes lies in the exuberant excess of\nhis subjective propensities,--his pre-eminence over them simply and\nsolely in the number and in the fantastic and unnecessary character of\nhis wants, physical, moral, aesthetic, and intellectual.  Had his whole\nlife not been a quest for the superfluous, he would never have\nestablished himself as inexpugnably as he has done in the necessary.\nAnd from the consciousness of this he should draw the lesson that his\nwants are to be trusted; that even {132} when their gratification seems\nfarthest off, the uneasiness they occasion is still the best guide of\nhis life, and will lead him to issues entirely beyond his present\npowers of reckoning.  Prune down his extravagance, sober him, and you\nundo him.  The appetite for immediate consistency at any cost, or what\nthe logicians call the 'law of parsimony,'--which is nothing but the\npassion for conceiving the universe in the most labor-saving\nway,--will, if made the exclusive law of the mind, end by blighting the\ndevelopment of the intellect itself quite as much as that of the\nfeelings or the will.  The scientific conception of the world as an\narmy of molecules gratifies this appetite after its fashion most\nexquisitely.  But if the religion of exclusive scientificism should\never succeed in suffocating all other appetites out of a nation's mind,\nand imbuing a whole race with the persuasion that simplicity and\nconsistency demand a _tabula rasa_ to be made of every notion that does\nnot form part of the _soi-disant_ scientific synthesis, that nation,\nthat race, will just as surely go to ruin, and fall a prey to their\nmore richly constituted neighbors, as the beasts of the field, as a\nwhole, have fallen a prey to man.\nI have myself little fear for our Anglo-Saxon race.  Its moral,\naesthetic, and practical wants form too dense a stubble to be mown by\nany scientific Occam's razor that has yet been forged.  The knights of\nthe razor will never form among us more than a sect; but when I see\ntheir fraternity increasing in numbers, and, what is worse, when I see\ntheir negations acquiring almost as much prestige and authority as\ntheir affirmations legitimately claim over the minds of the docile\npublic, I feel as if the influences working in the direction of our\nmental barbarization were {133} beginning to be rather strong, and\nneeded some positive counteraction.  And when I ask myself from what\nquarter the invasion may best be checked, I can find no answer as good\nas the one suggested by casting my eyes around this room.  For this\nneedful task, no fitter body of men than the Unitarian clergy exists.\nWho can uphold the rights of department Three of the mind with better\ngrace than those who long since showed how they could fight and suffer\nfor department One?  As, then, you burst the bonds of a narrow\necclesiastical tradition, by insisting that no fact of sense or result\nof science must be left out of account in the religious synthesis, so\nmay you still be the champions of mental completeness and\nall-sidedness.  May you, with equal success, avert the formation of a\nnarrow scientific tradition, and burst the bonds of any synthesis which\nwould pretend to leave out of account those forms of being, those\nrelations of reality, to which at present our active and emotional\ntendencies are our only avenues of approach.  I hear it said that\nUnitarianism is not growing in these days.  I know nothing of the truth\nof the statement; but if it be true, it is surely because the great\nship of Orthodoxy is nearing the port and the pilot is being taken on\nboard.  If you will only lead in a theistic science, as successfully as\nyou have led in a scientific theology, your separate name as Unitarians\nmay perish from the mouths of men; for your task will have been done,\nand your function at an end.  Until that distant day, you have work\nenough in both directions awaiting you.\nMeanwhile, let me pass to the next division of our subject.  I said\nthat we are forced to regard God as {134} the normal object of the\nmind's belief, inasmuch as any conception that falls short of God is\nirrational, if the word 'rational' be taken in its fullest sense; while\nany conception that goes beyond God is impossible, if the human mind be\nconstructed after the triadic-reflex pattern we have discussed at such\nlength.  The first half of the thesis has been disposed of.\nInfra-theistic conceptions, materialisms and agnosticisms, are\nirrational because they are inadequate stimuli to man's practical\nnature.  I have now to justify the latter half of the thesis.\nI dare say it may for an instant have perplexed some of you that I\nshould speak of conceptions that aimed at going beyond God, and of\nattempts to fly above him or outbid him; so I will now explain exactly\nwhat I mean.  In defining the essential attributes of God, I said he\nwas a personality lying outside our own and other than us,--a power not\nourselves.  Now, the attempts to fly beyond theism, of which I speak,\nare attempts to get over this ultimate duality of God and his believer,\nand to transform it into some sort or other of identity.  If\ninfratheistic ways of looking on the world leave it in the third\nperson, a mere _it_; and if theism turns the _it_ into a _thou_,--so we\nmay say that these other theories try to cover it with the mantle of\nthe first person, and to make it a part of _me_.\nI am well aware that I begin here to tread on ground in which trenchant\ndistinctions may easily seem to mutilate the facts.\nThat sense of emotional reconciliation with God which characterizes the\nhighest moments of the theistic consciousness may be described as\n'oneness' with him, and so from the very bosom of theism a {135}\nmonistic doctrine seem to arise.  But this consciousness of\nself-surrender, of absolute practical union between one's self and the\ndivine object of one's contemplation, is a totally different thing from\nany sort of substantial identity.  Still the object God and the subject\nI are two.  Still I simply come upon him, and find his existence given\nto me; and the climax of my practical union with what is given, forms\nat the same time the climax of my perception that as a numerical fact\nof existence I am something radically other than the Divinity with\nwhose effulgence I am filled.\nNow, it seems to me that the only sort of union of creature with\ncreator with which theism, properly so called, comports, is of this\nemotional and practical kind; and it is based unchangeably on the\nempirical fact that the thinking subject and the object thought are\nnumerically two.  How my mind and will, which are not God, can yet\ncognize and leap to meet him, how I ever came to be so separate from\nhim, and how God himself came to be at all, are problems that for the\ntheist can remain unsolved and insoluble forever.  It is sufficient for\nhim to know that he himself simply is, and needs God; and that behind\nthis universe God simply is and will be forever, and will in some way\nhear his call.  In the practical assurance of these empirical facts,\nwithout 'Erkentnisstheorie' or philosophical ontology, without\nmetaphysics of emanation or creation to justify or make them more\nintelligible, in the blessedness of their mere acknowledgment as given,\nlie all the peace and power he craves.  The floodgates of the religious\nlife are opened, and the full currents can pour through.\nIt is this empirical and practical side of the theistic position, its\ntheoretic chastity and modesty, which I {136} wish to accentuate here.\nThe highest flights of theistic mysticism, far from pretending to\npenetrate the secrets of the _me_ and the _thou_ in worship, and to\ntranscend the dualism by an act of intelligence, simply turn their\nbacks on such attempts.  The problem for them has simply\nvanished,--vanished from the sight of an attitude which refuses to\nnotice such futile theoretic difficulties.  Get but that \"peace of God\nwhich passeth understanding,\" and the questions of the understanding\nwill cease from puzzling and pedantic scruples be at rest.  In other\nwords, theistic mysticism, that form of theism which at first sight\nseems most to have transcended the fundamental otherness of God from\nman, has done it least of all in the theoretic way.  The pattern of its\nprocedure is precisely that of the simplest man dealing with the\nsimplest fact of his environment.  Both he and the theist tarry in\ndepartment Two of their minds only so long as is necessary to define\nwhat is the presence that confronts them.  The theist decides that its\ncharacter is such as to be fitly responded to on his part by a\nreligious reaction; and into that reaction he forthwith pours his soul.\nHis insight into the _what_ of life leads to results so immediately and\nintimately rational that the _why_, the _how_, and the _whence_ of it\nare questions that lose all urgency.  'Gef\u00fchl ist Alles,' Faust says.\nThe channels of department Three have drained those of department Two\nof their contents; and happiness over the fact that being has made\nitself what it is, evacuates all speculation as to how it could make\nitself at all.\nBut now, although to most human minds such a position as this will be\nthe position of rational equilibrium, it is not difficult to bring\nforward certain {137} considerations, in the light of which so simple\nand practical a mental movement begins to seem rather short-winded and\nsecond-rate and devoid of intellectual style.  This easy acceptance of\nan opaque limit to our speculative insight; this satisfaction with a\nBeing whose character we simply apprehend without comprehending\nanything more about him, and with whom after a certain point our\ndealings can be only of a volitional and emotional sort; above all,\nthis sitting down contented with a blank unmediated dualism,--are they\nnot the very picture of unfaithfulness to the rights and duties of our\ntheoretic reason?\nSurely, if the universe is reasonable (and we must believe that it is\nso), it must be susceptible, potentially at least, of being reasoned\n_out_ to the last drop without residuum.  Is it not rather an insult to\nthe very word 'rational' to say that the rational character of the\nuniverse and its creator means no more than that we practically feel at\nhome in their presence, and that our powers are a match for their\ndemands?  Do they not in fact demand to be _understood_ by us still\nmore than to be reacted on?  Is not the unparalleled development of\ndepartment Two of the mind in man his crowning glory and his very\nessence; and may not the _knowing of the truth_ be his absolute\nvocation?  And if it is, ought he flatly to acquiesce in a spiritual\nlife of 'reflex type,' whose form is no higher than that of the life\nthat animates his spinal cord,--nay, indeed, that animates the writhing\nsegments of any mutilated worm?\nIt is easy to see how such arguments and queries may result in the\nerection of an ideal of our mental destiny, far different from the\nsimple and practical religious one we have described.  We may well\nbegin {138} to ask whether such things as practical reactions can be\nthe final upshot and purpose of all our cognitive energy.  Mere outward\nacts, changes in the position of parts of matter (for they are nothing\nelse), can they possibly be the culmination and consummation of our\nrelations with the nature of things?  Can they possibly form a result\nto which our godlike powers of insight shall be judged merely\nsubservient?  Such an idea, if we scan it closely, soon begins to seem\nrather absurd.  Whence this piece of matter comes and whither that one\ngoes, what difference ought that to make to the nature of things,\nexcept so far as with the comings and the goings our wonderful inward\nconscious harvest may be reaped?\nAnd so, very naturally and gradually, one may be led from the theistic\nand practical point of view to what I shall call the _gnostical_ one.\nWe may think that department Three of the mind, with its doings of\nright and its doings of wrong, must be there only to serve department\nTwo; and we may suspect that the sphere of our activity exists for no\nother purpose than to illumine our cognitive consciousness by the\nexperience of its results.  Are not all sense and all emotion at bottom\nbut turbid and perplexed modes of what in its clarified shape is\nintelligent cognition?  Is not all experience just the eating of the\nfruit of the tree of _knowledge_ of good and evil, and nothing more?\nThese questions fan the fire of an unassuageable gnostic thirst, which\nis as far removed from theism in one direction as agnosticism was\nremoved from it in the other; and which aspires to nothing less than an\nabsolute unity of knowledge with its object, and refuses to be\nsatisfied short of a fusion and solution and saturation of both\nimpression and action with reason, and {139} an absorption of all three\ndepartments of the mind into one.  Time would fail us to-day (even had\nI the learning, which I have not) to speak of gnostic systems in\ndetail.  The aim of all of them is to shadow forth a sort of process by\nwhich spirit, emerging from its beginnings and exhausting the whole\ncircle of finite experience in its sweep, shall at last return and\npossess itself as its own object at the climax of its career.  This\nclimax is the religious consciousness.  At the giddy height of this\nconception, whose latest and best known form is the Hegelian\nphilosophy, definite words fail to serve their purpose; and the\nultimate goal,--where object and subject, worshipped and worshipper,\nfacts and the knowledge of them, fall into one, and where no other is\nleft outstanding beyond this one that alone is, and that we may call\nindifferently act or fact, reality or idea, God or creation,--this\ngoal, I say, has to be adumbrated to our halting and gasping\nintelligence by coarse physical metaphors, 'positings' and\n'self-returnings' and 'removals' and 'settings free,' which hardly help\nto make the matter clear.\nBut from the midst of the curdling and the circling of it all we seem\ndimly to catch a glimpse of a state in which the reality to be known\nand the power of knowing shall have become so mutually adequate that\neach exhaustively is absorbed by the other and the twain become one\nflesh, and in which the light shall somehow have soaked up all the\nouter darkness into its own ubiquitous beams.  Like all headlong\nideals, this apotheosis of the bare conceiving faculty has its depth\nand wildness, its pang and its charm.  To many it sings a truly siren\nstrain; and so long as it is held only as a postulate, as a mere\nvanishing {140} point to give perspective to our intellectual aim, it\nis hard to see any empirical title by which we may deny the legitimacy\nof gnosticism's claims.  That we are not as yet near the goal it\nprefigures can never be a reason why we might not continue indefinitely\nto approach it; and to all sceptical arguments, drawn from our reason's\nactual finiteness, gnosticism can still oppose its indomitable faith in\nthe infinite character of its potential destiny.\nNow, here it is that the physiologist's generalization, as it seems to\nme, may fairly come in, and by ruling any such extravagant faith out of\ncourt help to legitimate our personal mistrust of its pretensions.  I\nconfess that I myself have always had a great mistrust of the\npretensions of the gnostic faith.  Not only do I utterly fail to\nunderstand what a cognitive faculty erected into the absolute of being,\nwith itself as its object, can mean; but even if we grant it a being\nother than itself for object, I cannot reason myself out of the belief\nthat however familiar and at home we might become with the character of\nthat being, the bare being of it, the fact that it is there at all,\nmust always be something blankly given and presupposed in order that\nconception may begin its work; must in short lie beyond speculation,\nand not be enveloped in its sphere.\nAccordingly, it is with no small pleasure that as a student of\nphysiology and psychology I find the only lesson I can learn from these\nsciences to be one that corroborates these convictions.  From its first\ndawn to its highest actual attainment, we find that the cognitive\nfaculty, where it appears to exist at all, appears but as one element\nin an organic mental whole, and as a minister to higher mental\npowers,--the powers {141} of will.  Such a thing as its emancipation\nand absolution from these organic relations receives no faintest color\nof plausibility from any fact we can discern.  Arising as a part, in a\nmental and objective world which are both larger than itself, it must,\nwhatever its powers of growth may be (and I am far from wishing to\ndisparage them), remain a part to the end.  This is the character of\nthe cognitive element in all the mental life we know, and we have no\nreason to suppose that that character will ever change.  On the\ncontrary, it is more than probable that to the end of time our power of\nmoral and volitional response to the nature of things will be the\ndeepest organ of communication therewith we shall ever possess.  In\nevery being that is real there is something external to, and sacred\nfrom, the grasp of every other.  God's being is sacred from ours.  To\nco-operate with his creation by the best and rightest response seems\nall he wants of us.  In such co-operation with his purposes, not in any\nchimerical speculative conquest of him, not in any theoretic drinking\nof him up, must lie the real meaning of our destiny.\nThis is nothing new.  All men know it at those rare moments when the\nsoul sobers herself, and leaves off her chattering and protesting and\ninsisting about this formula or that.  In the silence of our theories\nwe then seem to listen, and to hear something like the pulse of Being\nbeat; and it is borne in upon us that the mere turning of the\ncharacter, the dumb willingness to suffer and to serve this universe,\nis more than all theories about it put together.  The most any theory\nabout it can do is to bring us to that.  Certain it is that the acutest\ntheories, the greatest intellectual power, the most elaborate\neducation, are a {142} sheer mockery when, as too often happens, they\nfeed mean motives and a nerveless will.  And it is equally certain that\na resolute moral energy, no matter how inarticulate or unequipped with\nlearning its owner may be, extorts from us a respect we should never\npay were we not satisfied that the essential root of human personality\nlay there.\nI have sketched my subject in the briefest outlines; but still I hope\nyou will agree that I have established my point, and that the\nphysiological view of mentality, so far from invalidating, can but give\naid and comfort to the theistic attitude of mind.  Between agnosticism\nand gnosticism, theism stands midway, and holds to what is true in\neach.  With agnosticism, it goes so far as to confess that we cannot\nknow how Being made itself or us.  With gnosticism, it goes so far as\nto insist that we can know Being's character when made, and how it asks\nus to behave.\nIf any one fear that in insisting so strongly that behavior is the aim\nand end of every sound philosophy I have curtailed the dignity and\nscope of the speculative function in us, I can only reply that in this\nascertainment of the _character_ of Being lies an almost infinite\nspeculative task.  Let the voluminous considerations by which all\nmodern thought converges toward idealistic or pan-psychic conclusions\nspeak for me.  Let the pages of a Hodgson, of a Lotze, of a Renouvier,\nreply whether within the limits drawn by purely empirical theism the\nspeculative faculty finds not, and shall not always find, enough to do.\nBut do it little or much, its _place_ in a philosophy is always the\nsame, and is set by the structural form of the mind.  Philosophies,\nwhether expressed in sonnets or {143} systems, all must wear this form.\nThe thinker starts from some experience of the practical world, and\nasks its meaning.  He launches himself upon the speculative sea, and\nmakes a voyage long or short.  He ascends into the empyrean, and\ncommunes with the eternal essences.  But whatever his achievements and\ndiscoveries be while gone, the utmost result they can issue in is some\nnew practical maxim or resolve, or the denial of some old one, with\nwhich inevitably he is sooner or later washed ashore on the _terra\nfirma_ of concrete life again.\nWhatever thought takes this voyage is a philosophy.  We have seen how\ntheism takes it.  And in the philosophy of a thinker who, though long\nneglected, is doing much to renovate the spiritual life of his native\nFrance to-day (I mean Charles Renouvier, whose writings ought to be\nbetter known among us than they are), we have an instructive example of\nthe way in which this very empirical element in theism, its confession\nof an ultimate opacity in things, of a dimension of being which escapes\nour theoretic control, may suggest a most definite practical\nconclusion,--this one, namely, that 'our wills are free.'  I will say\nnothing of Renouvier's line of reasoning; it is contained in many\nvolumes which I earnestly recommend to your attention.[10]  But to\nenforce my doctrine that the number of volumes is not what makes the\nphilosophy, let me conclude by recalling to you the little poem of\nTennyson, published last year, in which the speculative voyage is made,\nand the same conclusion reached in a few lines:--\n{144}\n\"Out of the deep, my child, out of the deep,\nFrom that great deep before our world begins,\nWhereon the Spirit of God moves as he will,--\nOut of the deep, my child, out of the deep,\nFrom that true world within the world we see,\nWhereof our world is but the bounding shore,--\nOut of the deep, Spirit, out of the deep,\nWith this ninth moon that sends the hidden sun\nDown yon dark sea, thou comest, darling boy.\nFor in the world which is not ours, they said,\n'Let us make man,' and that which should be man,\nFrom that one light no man can look upon,\nDrew to this shore lit by the suns and moons\nAnd all the shadows.  O dear Spirit, half-lost\nIn thine own shadow and this fleshly sign\nThat thou art thou,--who wailest being born\nAnd banish'd into mystery,...\n...our mortal veil\nAnd shattered phantom of that Infinite One,\nWho made thee unconceivably thyself\nOut of his whole world-self and all in all,--\nLive thou, and of the grain and husk, the grape\nAnd ivyberry, choose; and still depart\nFrom death to death through life and life, and find\nNearer and ever nearer Him who wrought\nNot matter, nor the finite-infinite,\n_But this main miracle, that thou art thou,\nWith power on thine own act and on the world_.\"\n[1] Address delivered to the Unitarian Ministers' Institute at\nPrinceton, Mass., 1881, and printed in the Unitarian Review for October\nof that year.\n[2] See some Remarks on Spencer's Definition of Mind, in the Journal of\nSpeculative Philosophy for January, 1878.\n[3] \"No amount of failure in the attempt to subject the world of\nsensible experience to a thorough-going system of conceptions, and to\nbring all happenings back to cases of immutably valid law, is able to\nshake our faith in the rightness of our principles.  We hold fast to\nour demand that even the greatest apparent confusion must sooner or\nlater solve itself in transparent formulas.  We begin the work ever\nafresh; and, refusing to believe that nature will permanently withhold\nthe reward of our exertions, think rather that we have hitherto only\nfailed to push them in the right direction.  And all this pertinacity\nflows from a conviction that we have no right to renounce the\nfulfilment of our task.  What, in short sustains the courage of\ninvestigators is the force of obligation of an ethical idea.\"\n(Sigwart: Logik, bd. ii., p. 23.)\nThis is a true account of the spirit of science.  Does it essentially\ndiffer from the spirit of religion?  And is any one entitled to say in\nadvance, that, while the one form of faith shall be crowned with\nsuccess, the other is certainly doomed to fail?\n[4] Concerning the transformation of the given order into the order of\nconception, see S. H. Hodgson, The Philosophy of Reflection, chap. v.;\nH. Lotze, Logik, sects. 342-351; C. Sigwart, Logik, sects. 60-63, 105.\n[5] Haeckel has recently (Der Monismus, 1893, p. 37) proposed the\nCosmic Ether as a divinity fitted to reconcile science with theistic\nfaith.\n[6] See the admirably original \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science,\"\nby C. S. Peirce, especially the second paper, \"How to make our Thoughts\nclear,\" in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1878.\n[7] On this subject, see the preceding Essay.\n[8] \"As soon as it is recognized that our thought, as logic deals with\nit, reposes on our _will to think_, the primacy of the will, even in\nthe theoretical sphere, must be conceded; and the last of\npresuppositions is not merely [Kant's] that 'I think' must accompany\nall my representations, but also that 'I will' must dominate all my\nthinking.\"  (Sigwart; Logik, ll. 25.)\n[9] As our ancestors said, _Fiat justitia, pereat mundus_, so we, who\ndo not believe in justice or any absolute good, must, according to\nthese prophets, be willing to see the world perish, in order that\n_scientia fiat_.  Was there ever a more exquisite idol of the den, or\nrather of the _shop_?  In the clean sweep to be made of superstitions,\nlet the idol of stern obligation to be scientific go with the rest, and\npeople will have a fair chance to understand one another.  But this\nblowing of hot and of cold makes nothing but confusion.\n[10] Especially the Essais de Critique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 2me Edition, 6 vols.,\n12mo, Paris, 1875; and the Esquisse d'une Classification Syst\u00e9matique\ndes Doctrines Philosophiques, 2 vols., 8vo, Paris, 1885.\n{145}\nTHE DILEMMA OF DETERMINISM.[1]\nA common opinion prevails that the juice has ages ago been pressed out\nof the free-will controversy, and that no new champion can do more than\nwarm up stale arguments which every one has heard.  This is a radical\nmistake.  I know of no subject less worn out, or in which inventive\ngenius has a better chance of breaking open new ground,--not, perhaps,\nof forcing a conclusion or of coercing assent, but of deepening our\nsense of what the issue between the two parties really is, of what the\nideas of fate and of free-will imply.  At our very side almost, in the\npast few years, we have seen falling in rapid succession from the press\nworks that present the alternative in entirely novel lights.  Not to\nspeak of the English disciples of Hegel, such as Green and Bradley; not\nto speak of Hinton and Hodgson, nor of Hazard here,--we see in the\nwritings of Renouvier, Fouill\u00e9e, and Delboeuf[2] how completely changed\nand refreshed is the form of all the old disputes.  I cannot pretend to\nvie in originality with any of the masters I have named, and my\nambition limits itself to just one little point.  If I can make two of\nthe necessarily implied corollaries {146} of determinism clearer to you\nthan they have been made before, I shall have made it possible for you\nto decide for or against that doctrine with a better understanding of\nwhat you are about.  And if you prefer not to decide at all, but to\nremain doubters, you will at least see more plainly what the subject of\nyour hesitation is.  I thus disclaim openly on the threshold all\npretension to prove to you that the freedom of the will is true.  The\nmost I hope is to induce some of you to follow my own example in\nassuming it true, and acting as if it were true.  If it be true, it\nseems to me that this is involved in the strict logic of the case.  Its\ntruth ought not to be forced willy-nilly down our indifferent throats.\nIt ought to be freely espoused by men who can equally well turn their\nbacks upon it.  In other words, our first act of freedom, if we are\nfree, ought in all inward propriety to be to affirm that we are free.\nThis should exclude, it seems to me, from the free-will side of the\nquestion all hope of a coercive demonstration,--a demonstration which\nI, for one, am perfectly contented to go without.\nWith thus much understood at the outset, we can advance.  But not\nwithout one more point understood as well.  The arguments I am about to\nurge all proceed on two suppositions: first, when we make theories\nabout the world and discuss them with one another, we do so in order to\nattain a conception of things which shall give us subjective\nsatisfaction; and, second, if there be two conceptions, and the one\nseems to us, on the whole, more rational than the other, we are\nentitled to suppose that the more rational one is the truer of the two.\nI hope that you are all willing to make these suppositions with me;\n{147} for I am afraid that if there be any of you here who are not,\nthey will find little edification in the rest of what I have to say.  I\ncannot stop to argue the point; but I myself believe that all the\nmagnificent achievements of mathematical and physical science--our\ndoctrines of evolution, of uniformity of law, and the rest--proceed\nfrom our indomitable desire to cast the world into a more rational\nshape in our minds than the shape into which it is thrown there by the\ncrude order of our experience.  The world has shown itself, to a great\nextent, plastic to this demand of ours for rationality.  How much\nfarther it will show itself plastic no one can say.  Our only means of\nfinding out is to try; and I, for one, feel as free to try conceptions\nof moral as of mechanical or of logical rationality.  If a certain\nformula for expressing the nature of the world violates my moral\ndemand, I shall feel as free to throw it overboard, or at least to\ndoubt it, as if it disappointed my demand for uniformity of sequence,\nfor example; the one demand being, so far as I can see, quite as\nsubjective and emotional as the other is.  The principle of causality,\nfor example,--what is it but a postulate, an empty name covering simply\na demand that the sequence of events shall some day manifest a deeper\nkind of belonging of one thing with another than the mere arbitrary\njuxtaposition which now phenomenally appears?  It is as much an altar\nto an unknown god as the one that Saint Paul found at Athens.  All our\nscientific and philosophic ideals are altars to unknown gods.\nUniformity is as much so as is free-will.  If this be admitted, we can\ndebate on even terms.  But if any one pretends that while freedom and\nvariety are, in the first instance, subjective demands, necessity and\nuniformity are something {148} altogether different, I do not see how\nwe can debate at all.[3]\nTo begin, then, I must suppose you acquainted with all the usual\narguments on the subject.  I cannot stop to take up the old proofs from\ncausation, from statistics, from the certainty with which we can\nforetell one another's conduct, from the fixity of character, and all\nthe rest.  But there are two words which usually encumber these\nclassical arguments, {149} and which we must immediately dispose of if\nwe are to make any progress.  One is the eulogistic word _freedom_, and\nthe other is the opprobrious word _chance_.  The word 'chance' I wish\nto keep, but I wish to get rid of the word 'freedom.'  Its eulogistic\nassociations have so far overshadowed all the rest of its meaning that\nboth parties claim the sole right to use it, and determinists to-day\ninsist that they alone are freedom's champions.  Old-fashioned\ndeterminism was what we may call _hard_ determinism.  It did not shrink\nfrom such words as fatality, bondage of the will, necessitation, and\nthe like.  Nowadays, we have a _soft_ determinism which abhors harsh\nwords, and, repudiating fatality, necessity, and even predetermination,\nsays that its real name is freedom; for freedom is only necessity\nunderstood, and bondage to the highest is identical with true freedom.\nEven a writer as little used to making capital out of soft words as Mr.\nHodgson hesitates not to call himself a 'free-will determinist.'\nNow, all this is a quagmire of evasion under which the real issue of\nfact has been entirely smothered.  Freedom in all these senses presents\nsimply no problem at all.  No matter what the soft determinist mean by\nit,--whether he mean the acting without external constraint; whether he\nmean the acting rightly, or whether he mean the acquiescing in the law\nof the whole,--who cannot answer him that sometimes we are free and\nsometimes we are not?  But there _is_ a problem, an issue of fact and\nnot of words, an issue of the most momentous importance, which is often\ndecided without discussion in one sentence,--nay, in one clause of a\nsentence,--by those very writers who spin out whole chapters in their\nefforts to show {150} what 'true' freedom is; and that is the question\nof determinism, about which we are to talk to-night.\nFortunately, no ambiguities hang about this word or about its opposite,\nindeterminism.  Both designate an outward way in which things may\nhappen, and their cold and mathematical sound has no sentimental\nassociations that can bribe our partiality either way in advance.  Now,\nevidence of an external kind to decide between determinism and\nindeterminism is, as I intimated a while back, strictly impossible to\nfind.  Let us look at the difference between them and see for\nourselves.  What does determinism profess?\nIt professes that those parts of the universe already laid down\nabsolutely appoint and decree what the other parts shall be.  The\nfuture has no ambiguous possibilities hidden in its womb: the part we\ncall the present is compatible with only one totality.  Any other\nfuture complement than the one fixed from eternity is impossible.  The\nwhole is in each and every part, and welds it with the rest into an\nabsolute unity, an iron block, in which there can be no equivocation or\nshadow of turning.\n\"With earth's first clay they did the last man knead,\nAnd there of the last harvest sowed the seed.\nAnd the first morning of creation wrote\nWhat the last dawn of reckoning shall read.\"\nIndeterminism, on the contrary, says that the parts have a certain\namount of loose play on one another, so that the laying down of one of\nthem does not necessarily determine what the others shall be.  It\nadmits that possibilities may be in excess of actualities, and that\nthings not yet revealed to our knowledge may really in themselves be\nambiguous.  Of two {151} alternative futures which we conceive, both\nmay now be really possible; and the one become impossible only at the\nvery moment when the other excludes it by becoming real itself.\nIndeterminism thus denies the world to be one unbending unit of fact.\nIt says there is a certain ultimate pluralism in it; and, so saying, it\ncorroborates our ordinary unsophisticated view of things.  To that\nview, actualities seem to float in a wider sea of possibilities from\nout of which they are chosen; and, _somewhere_, indeterminism says,\nsuch possibilities exist, and form a part of truth.\nDeterminism, on the contrary, says they exist _nowhere_, and that\nnecessity on the one hand and impossibility on the other are the sole\ncategories of the real.  Possibilities that fail to get realized are,\nfor determinism, pure illusions: they never were possibilities at all.\nThere is nothing inchoate, it says, about this universe of ours, all\nthat was or is or shall be actual in it having been from eternity\nvirtually there.  The cloud of alternatives our minds escort this mass\nof actuality withal is a cloud of sheer deceptions, to which\n'impossibilities' is the only name that rightfully belongs.\nThe issue, it will be seen, is a perfectly sharp one, which no\neulogistic terminology can smear over or wipe out.  The truth _must_\nlie with one side or the other, and its lying with one side makes the\nother false.\nThe question relates solely to the existence of possibilities, in the\nstrict sense of the term, as things that may, but need not, be.  Both\nsides admit that a volition, for instance, has occurred.  The\nindeterminists say another volition might have occurred in its place;\nthe determinists swear that nothing could possibly {152} have occurred\nin its place.  Now, can science be called in to tell us which of these\ntwo point-blank contradicters of each other is right?  Science\nprofesses to draw no conclusions but such as are based on matters of\nfact, things that have actually happened; but how can any amount of\nassurance that something actually happened give us the least grain of\ninformation as to whether another thing might or might not have\nhappened in its place?  Only facts can be proved by other facts.  With\nthings that are possibilities and not facts, facts have no concern.  If\nwe have no other evidence than the evidence of existing facts, the\npossibility-question must remain a mystery never to be cleared up.\nAnd the truth is that facts practically have hardly anything to do with\nmaking us either determinists or indeterminists.  Sure enough, we make\na flourish of quoting facts this way or that; and if we are\ndeterminists, we talk about the infallibility with which we can predict\none another's conduct; while if we are indeterminists, we lay great\nstress on the fact that it is just because we cannot foretell one\nanother's conduct, either in war or statecraft or in any of the great\nand small intrigues and businesses of men, that life is so intensely\nanxious and hazardous a game.  But who does not see the wretched\ninsufficiency of this so-called objective testimony on both sides?\nWhat fills up the gaps in our minds is something not objective, not\nexternal.  What divides us into possibility men and anti-possibility\nmen is different faiths or postulates,--postulates of rationality.  To\nthis man the world seems more rational with possibilities in it,--to\nthat man more rational with possibilities excluded; and talk as we will\nabout having to yield to {153} evidence, what makes us monists or\npluralists, determinists or indeterminists, is at bottom always some\nsentiment like this.\nThe stronghold of the deterministic sentiment is the antipathy to the\nidea of chance.  As soon as we begin to talk indeterminism to our\nfriends, we find a number of them shaking their heads.  This notion of\nalternative possibility, they say, this admission that any one of\nseveral things may come to pass, is, after all, only a roundabout name\nfor chance; and chance is something the notion of which no sane mind\ncan for an instant tolerate in the world.  What is it, they ask, but\nbarefaced crazy unreason, the negation of intelligibility and law?  And\nif the slightest particle of it exist anywhere, what is to prevent the\nwhole fabric from falling together, the stars from going out, and chaos\nfrom recommencing her topsy-turvy reign?\nRemarks of this sort about chance will put an end to discussion as\nquickly as anything one can find.  I have already told you that\n'chance' was a word I wished to keep and use.  Let us then examine\nexactly what it means, and see whether it ought to be such a terrible\nbugbear to us.  I fancy that squeezing the thistle boldly will rob it\nof its sting.\nThe sting of the word 'chance' seems to lie in the assumption that it\nmeans something positive, and that if anything happens by chance, it\nmust needs be something of an intrinsically irrational and preposterous\nsort.  Now, chance means nothing of the kind.  It is a purely negative\nand relative term,[4] giving us {154} no information about that of\nwhich it is predicated, except that it happens to be disconnected with\nsomething else,--not controlled, secured, or necessitated by other\nthings in advance of its own actual presence.  As this point is the\nmost subtile one of the whole lecture, and at the same time the point\non which all the rest hinges, I beg you to pay particular attention to\nit.  What I say is that it tells us nothing about what a thing may be\nin itself to call it 'chance.'  It may be a bad thing, it may be a good\nthing.  It may be lucidity, transparency, fitness incarnate, matching\nthe whole system of other things, when it has once befallen, in an\nunimaginably perfect way.  All you mean by calling it 'chance' is that\nthis is not guaranteed, that it may also fall out otherwise.  For the\nsystem of other things has no positive hold on the chance-thing.  Its\norigin is in a certain fashion negative: it escapes, and says, Hands\noff! coming, when it comes, as a free gift, or not at all.\nThis negativeness, however, and this opacity of the chance-thing when\nthus considered _ab. extra_, or from the point of view of previous\nthings or distant things, do not preclude its having any amount of\npositiveness and luminosity from within, and at its own place and\nmoment.  All that its chance-character asserts about it is that there\nis something in it really of its own, something that is not the\nunconditional property of the whole.  If the whole wants this property,\nthe whole must wait till it can get it, if it be a matter of chance.\nThat the universe may actually be a sort of joint-stock society of this\nsort, in which the sharers have both limited liabilities and limited\npowers, is of course a simple and conceivable notion.\nNevertheless, many persons talk as if the minutest {155} dose of\ndisconnectedness of one part with another, the smallest modicum of\nindependence, the faintest tremor of ambiguity about the future, for\nexample, would ruin everything, and turn this goodly universe into a\nsort of insane sand-heap or nulliverse, no universe at all.  Since\nfuture human volitions are as a matter of fact the only ambiguous\nthings we are tempted to believe in, let us stop for a moment to make\nourselves sure whether their independent and accidental character need\nbe fraught with such direful consequences to the universe as these.\nWhat is meant by saying that my choice of which way to walk home after\nthe lecture is ambiguous and matter of chance as far as the present\nmoment is concerned?  It means that both Divinity Avenue and Oxford\nStreet are called; but that only one, and that one _either_ one, shall\nbe chosen.  Now, I ask you seriously to suppose that this ambiguity of\nmy choice is real; and then to make the impossible hypothesis that the\nchoice is made twice over, and each time falls on a different street.\nIn other words, imagine that I first walk through Divinity Avenue, and\nthen imagine that the powers governing the universe annihilate ten\nminutes of time with all that it contained, and set me back at the door\nof this hall just as I was before the choice was made.  Imagine then\nthat, everything else being the same, I now make a different choice and\ntraverse Oxford Street.  You, as passive spectators, look on and see\nthe two alternative universes,--one of them with me walking through\nDivinity Avenue in it, the other with the same me walking through\nOxford Street.  Now, if you are determinists you believe one of these\nuniverses to have been from eternity impossible: you believe it to have\n{156} been impossible because of the intrinsic irrationality or\naccidentality somewhere involved in it.  But looking outwardly at these\nuniverses, can you say which is the impossible and accidental one, and\nwhich the rational and necessary one?  I doubt if the most iron-clad\ndeterminist among you could have the slightest glimmer of light on this\npoint.  In other words, either universe _after the fact_ and once there\nwould, to our means of observation and understanding, appear just as\nrational as the other.  There would be absolutely no criterion by which\nwe might judge one necessary and the other matter of chance.  Suppose\nnow we relieve the gods of their hypothetical task and assume my\nchoice, once made, to be made forever.  I go through Divinity Avenue\nfor good and all.  If, as good determinists, you now begin to affirm,\nwhat all good determinists punctually do affirm, that in the nature of\nthings I _couldn't_ have gone through Oxford Street,--had I done so it\nwould have been chance, irrationality, insanity, a horrid gap in\nnature,--I simply call your attention to this, that your affirmation is\nwhat the Germans call a _Machtspruch_, a mere conception fulminated as\na dogma and based on no insight into details.  Before my choice, either\nstreet seemed as natural to you as to me.  Had I happened to take\nOxford Street, Divinity Avenue would have figured in your philosophy as\nthe gap in nature; and you would have so proclaimed it with the best\ndeterministic conscience in the world.\nBut what a hollow outcry, then, is this against a chance which, if it\nwere present to us, we could by no character whatever distinguish from\na rational necessity!  I have taken the most trivial of examples, but\nno possible example could lead to any different {157} result.  For what\nare the alternatives which, in point of fact, offer themselves to human\nvolition?  What are those futures that now seem matters of chance?  Are\nthey not one and all like the Divinity Avenue and Oxford Street of our\nexample?  Are they not all of them _kinds_ of things already here and\nbased in the existing frame of nature?  Is any one ever tempted to\nproduce an _absolute_ accident, something utterly irrelevant to the\nrest of the world?  Do not all the motives that assail us, all the\nfutures that offer themselves to our choice, spring equally from the\nsoil of the past; and would not either one of them, whether realized\nthrough chance or through necessity, the moment it was realized, seem\nto us to fit that past, and in the completest and most continuous\nmanner to interdigitate with the phenomena already there?[5]\nThe more one thinks of the matter, the more one wonders that so empty\nand gratuitous a hubbub as this outcry against chance should have found\nso great an echo in the hearts of men.  It is a word which tells us\nabsolutely nothing about what chances, or about the _modus operandi_ of\nthe chancing; and the use of it as a war-cry shows only a temper of\n{158} intellectual absolutism, a demand that the world shall be a solid\nblock, subject to one control,--which temper, which demand, the world\nmay not be bound to gratify at all.  In every outwardly verifiable and\npractical respect, a world in which the alternatives that now actually\ndistract _your_ choice were decided by pure chance would be by _me_\nabsolutely undistinguished from the world in which I now live.  I am,\ntherefore, entirely willing to call it, so far as your choices go, a\nworld of chance for me.  To _yourselves_, it is true, those very acts\nof choice, which to me are so blind, opaque, and external, are the\nopposites of this, for you are within them and effect them.  To you\nthey appear as decisions; and decisions, for him who makes them, are\naltogether peculiar psychic facts.  Self-luminous and self-justifying\nat the living moment at which they occur, they appeal to no outside\nmoment to put its stamp upon them or make them continuous with the rest\nof nature.  Themselves it is rather who seem to make nature continuous;\nand in their strange and intense function of granting consent to one\npossibility and withholding it from another, to transform an equivocal\nand double future into an inalterable and simple past.\nBut with the psychology of the matter we have no concern this evening.\nThe quarrel which determinism has with chance fortunately has nothing\nto do with this or that psychological detail.  It is a quarrel\naltogether metaphysical.  Determinism denies the ambiguity of future\nvolitions, because it affirms that nothing future can be ambiguous.\nBut we have said enough to meet the issue.  Indeterminate future\nvolitions do mean chance.  Let us not fear to shout it from the\nhouse-tops if need be; for we now know that {159} the idea of chance\nis, at bottom, exactly the same thing as the idea of gift,--the one\nsimply being a disparaging, and the other a eulogistic, name for\nanything on which we have no effective _claim_.  And whether the world\nbe the better or the worse for having either chances or gifts in it\nwill depend altogether on _what_ these uncertain and unclaimable things\nturn out to be.\nAnd this at last brings us within sight of our subject.  We have seen\nwhat determinism means: we have seen that indeterminism is rightly\ndescribed as meaning chance; and we have seen that chance, the very\nname of which we are urged to shrink from as from a metaphysical\npestilence, means only the negative fact that no part of the world,\nhowever big, can claim to control absolutely the destinies of the\nwhole.  But although, in discussing the word 'chance,' I may at moments\nhave seemed to be arguing for its real existence, I have not meant to\ndo so yet.  We have not yet ascertained whether this be a world of\nchance or no; at most, we have agreed that it seems so.  And I now\nrepeat what I said at the outset, that, from any strict theoretical\npoint of view, the question is insoluble.  To deepen our theoretic\nsense of the _difference_ between a world with chances in it and a\ndeterministic world is the most I can hope to do; and this I may now at\nlast begin upon, after all our tedious clearing of the way.\nI wish first of all to show you just what the notion that this is a\ndeterministic world implies.  The implications I call your attention to\nare all bound up with the fact that it is a world in which we\nconstantly have to make what I shall, with your permission, call\njudgments of regret.  Hardly an hour passes in {160} which we do not\nwish that something might be otherwise; and happy indeed are those of\nus whose hearts have never echoed the wish of Omar Khayam--\n\"That we might clasp, ere closed, the book of fate,\nAnd make the writer on a fairer leaf\nInscribe our names, or quite obliterate.\n\"Ah!  Love, could you and I with fate conspire\nTo mend this sorry scheme of things entire,\nWould we not shatter it to bits, and then\nRemould it nearer to the heart's desire?\"\nNow, it is undeniable that most of these regrets are foolish, and quite\non a par in point of philosophic value with the criticisms on the\nuniverse of that friend of our infancy, the hero of the fable The\nAtheist and the Acorn,--\n\"Fool! had that bough a pumpkin bore,\nThy whimsies would have worked no more,\" etc.\nEven from the point of view of our own ends, we should probably make a\nbotch of remodelling the universe.  How much more then from the point\nof view of ends we cannot see!  Wise men therefore regret as little as\nthey can.  But still some regrets are pretty obstinate and hard to\nstifle,--regrets for acts of wanton cruelty or treachery, for example,\nwhether performed by others or by ourselves.  Hardly any one can remain\n_entirely_ optimistic after reading the confession of the murderer at\nBrockton the other day: how, to get rid of the wife whose continued\nexistence bored him, he inveigled her into a desert spot, shot her four\ntimes, and then, as she lay on the ground and said to him, \"You didn't\ndo it on purpose, did you, dear?\" replied, \"No, I {161} didn't do it on\npurpose,\" as he raised a rock and smashed her skull.  Such an\noccurrence, with the mild sentence and self-satisfaction of the\nprisoner, is a field for a crop of regrets, which one need not take up\nin detail.  We feel that, although a perfect mechanical fit to the rest\nof the universe, it is a bad moral fit, and that something else would\nreally have been better in its place.\nBut for the deterministic philosophy the murder, the sentence, and the\nprisoner's optimism were all necessary from eternity; and nothing else\nfor a moment had a ghost of a chance of being put into their place.  To\nadmit such a chance, the determinists tell us, would be to make a\nsuicide of reason; so we must steel our hearts against the thought.\nAnd here our plot thickens, for we see the first of those difficult\nimplications of determinism and monism which it is my purpose to make\nyou feel.  If this Brockton murder was called for by the rest of the\nuniverse, if it had to come at its preappointed hour, and if nothing\nelse would have been consistent with the sense of the whole, what are\nwe to think of the universe?  Are we stubbornly to stick to our\njudgment of regret, and say, though it _couldn't_ be, yet it _would_\nhave been a better universe with something different from this Brockton\nmurder in it?  That, of course, seems the natural and spontaneous thing\nfor us to do; and yet it is nothing short of deliberately espousing a\nkind of pessimism.  The judgment of regret calls the murder bad.\nCalling a thing bad means, if it mean anything at all, that the thing\nought not to be, that something else ought to be in its stead.\nDeterminism, in denying that anything else can be in its stead,\nvirtually defines the universe {162} as a place in which what ought to\nbe is impossible,--in other words, as an organism whose constitution is\nafflicted with an incurable taint, an irremediable flaw.  The pessimism\nof a Schopenhauer says no more than this,--that the murder is a\nsymptom; and that it is a vicious symptom because it belongs to a\nvicious whole, which can express its nature no otherwise than by\nbringing forth just such a symptom as that at this particular spot.\nRegret for the murder must transform itself, if we are determinists and\nwise, into a larger regret.  It is absurd to regret the murder alone.\nOther things being what they are, _it_ could not be different.  What we\nshould regret is that whole frame of things of which the murder is one\nmember.  I see no escape whatever from this pessimistic conclusion, if,\nbeing determinists, our judgment of regret is to be allowed to stand at\nall.\nThe only deterministic escape from pessimism is everywhere to abandon\nthe judgment of regret.  That this can be done, history shows to be not\nimpossible.  The devil, _quoad existentiam_, may be good.  That is,\nalthough he be a _principle_ of evil, yet the universe, with such a\nprinciple in it, may practically be a better universe than it could\nhave been without.  On every hand, in a small way, we find that a\ncertain amount of evil is a condition by which a higher form of good is\nbought.  There is nothing to prevent anybody from generalizing this\nview, and trusting that if we could but see things in the largest of\nall ways, even such matters as this Brockton murder would appear to be\npaid for by the uses that follow in their train.  An optimism _quand\nm\u00eame_, a systematic and infatuated optimism like that ridiculed by\nVoltaire in his Candide, is one of the possible {163} ideal ways in\nwhich a man may train himself to look on life.  Bereft of dogmatic\nhardness and lit up with the expression of a tender and pathetic hope,\nsuch an optimism has been the grace of some of the most religious\ncharacters that ever lived.\n\"Throb thine with Nature's throbbing breast,\nAnd all is clear from east to west.\"\nEven cruelty and treachery may be among the absolutely blessed fruits\nof time, and to quarrel with any of their details may be blasphemy.\nThe only real blasphemy, in short, may be that pessimistic temper of\nthe soul which lets it give way to such things as regrets, remorse, and\ngrief.\nThus, our deterministic pessimism may become a deterministic optimism\nat the price of extinguishing our judgments of regret.\nBut does not this immediately bring us into a curious logical\npredicament?  Our determinism leads us to call our judgments of regret\nwrong, because they are pessimistic in implying that what is impossible\nyet ought to be.  But how then about the judgments of regret\nthemselves?  If they are wrong, other judgments, judgments of approval\npresumably, ought to be in their place.  But as they are necessitated,\nnothing else _can_ be in their place; and the universe is just what it\nwas before,--namely, a place in which what ought to be appears\nimpossible.  We have got one foot out of the pessimistic bog, but the\nother one sinks all the deeper.  We have rescued our actions from the\nbonds of evil, but our judgments are now held fast.  When murders and\ntreacheries cease to be sins, regrets are theoretic absurdities and\nerrors.  The theoretic and the active life thus play a kind of {164}\nsee-saw with each other on the ground of evil.  The rise of either\nsends the other down.  Murder and treachery cannot be good without\nregret being bad: regret cannot be good without treachery and murder\nbeing bad.  Both, however, are supposed to have been foredoomed; so\nsomething must be fatally unreasonable, absurd, and wrong in the world.\nIt must be a place of which either sin or error forms a necessary part.\nFrom this dilemma there seems at first sight no escape.  Are we then so\nsoon to fall back into the pessimism from which we thought we had\nemerged?  And is there no possible way by which we may, with good\nintellectual consciences, call the cruelties and the treacheries, the\nreluctances and the regrets, _all_ good together?\nCertainly there is such a way, and you are probably most of you ready\nto formulate it yourselves.  But, before doing so, remark how\ninevitably the question of determinism and indeterminism slides us into\nthe question of optimism and pessimism, or, as our fathers called it,\n'the question of evil.'  The theological form of all these disputes is\nthe simplest and the deepest, the form from which there is the least\nescape,--not because, as some have sarcastically said, remorse and\nregret are clung to with a morbid fondness by the theologians as\nspiritual luxuries, but because they are existing facts of the world,\nand as such must be taken into account in the deterministic\ninterpretation of all that is fated to be.  If they are fated to be\nerror, does not the bat's wing of irrationality still cast its shadow\nover the world?\nThe refuge from the quandary lies, as I said, not far off.  The\nnecessary acts we erroneously regret {165} may be good, and yet our\nerror in so regretting them may be also good, on one simple condition;\nand that condition is this: The world must not be regarded as a machine\nwhose final purpose is the making real of any outward good, but rather\nas a contrivance for deepening the theoretic consciousness of what\ngoodness and evil in their intrinsic natures are.  Not the doing either\nof good or of evil is what nature cares for, but the knowing of them.\nLife is one long eating of the fruit of the tree of _knowledge_.  I am\nin the habit, in thinking to myself, of calling this point of view the\n_gnostical_ point of view.  According to it, the world is neither an\noptimism nor a pessimism, but a _gnosticism_.  But as this term may\nperhaps lead to some misunderstandings, I will use it as little as\npossible here, and speak rather of _subjectivism_, and the\n_subjectivistic_ point of view.\nSubjectivism has three great branches,--we may call them scientificism,\nsentimentalism, and sensualism, respectively.  They all agree\nessentially about the universe, in deeming that what happens there is\nsubsidiary to what we think or feel about it.  Crime justifies its\ncriminality by awakening our intelligence of that criminality, and\neventually our remorses and regrets; and the error included in remorses\nand regrets, the error of supposing that the past could have been\ndifferent, justifies itself by its use.  Its use is to quicken our\nsense of _what_ the irretrievably lost is.  When we think of it as that\nwhich might have been ('the saddest words of tongue or pen'), the\nquality of its worth speaks to us with a wilder sweetness; and,\nconversely, the dissatisfaction wherewith we think of what seems to\nhave driven it from its natural place gives us the severer pang.\nAdmirable artifice of {166} nature! we might be tempted to\nexclaim,--deceiving us in order the better to enlighten us, and leaving\nnothing undone to accentuate to our consciousness the yawning distance\nof those opposite poles of good and evil between which creation swings.\nWe have thus clearly revealed to our view what may be called the\ndilemma of determinism, so far as determinism pretends to think things\nout at all.  A merely mechanical determinism, it is true, rather\nrejoices in not thinking them out.  It is very sure that the universe\nmust satisfy its postulate of a physical continuity and coherence, but\nit smiles at any one who comes forward with a postulate of moral\ncoherence as well.  I may suppose, however, that the number of purely\nmechanical or hard determinists among you this evening is small.  The\ndeterminism to whose seductions you are most exposed is what I have\ncalled soft determinism,--the determinism which allows considerations\nof good and bad to mingle with those of cause and effect in deciding\nwhat sort of a universe this may rationally be held to be.  The dilemma\nof this determinism is one whose left horn is pessimism and whose right\nhorn is subjectivism.  In other words, if determinism is to escape\npessimism, it must leave off looking at the goods and ills of life in a\nsimple objective way, and regard them as materials, indifferent in\nthemselves, for the production of consciousness, scientific and\nethical, in us.\nTo escape pessimism is, as we all know, no easy task.  Your own studies\nhave sufficiently shown you the almost desperate difficulty of making\nthe notion that there is a single principle of things, and that\nprinciple absolute perfection, rhyme together with {167} our daily\nvision of the facts of life.  If perfection be the principle, how comes\nthere any imperfection here?  If God be good, how came he to\ncreate--or, if he did not create, how comes he to permit--the devil?\nThe evil facts must be explained as seeming: the devil must be\nwhitewashed, the universe must be disinfected, if neither God's\ngoodness nor his unity and power are to remain impugned.  And of all\nthe various ways of operating the disinfection, and making bad seem\nless bad, the way of subjectivism appears by far the best.[6]\nFor, after all, is there not something rather absurd in our ordinary\nnotion of external things being good or bad in themselves?  Can murders\nand treacheries, considered as mere outward happenings, or motions of\nmatter, be bad without any one to feel their badness?  And could\nparadise properly be good in the absence of a sentient principle by\nwhich the goodness was perceived?  Outward goods and evils seem\npractically indistinguishable except in so far as they result in\ngetting moral judgments made about them.  But then the moral judgments\nseem the main thing, and the outward facts mere perishing instruments\nfor their production.  This is subjectivism.  Every one must at some\ntime have wondered at that strange paradox of our moral nature, that,\nthough the {168} pursuit of outward good is the breath of its nostrils,\nthe attainment of outward good would seem to be its suffocation and\ndeath.  Why does the painting of any paradise or Utopia, in heaven or\non earth, awaken such yawnings for nirvana and escape?  The white-robed\nharp-playing heaven of our sabbath-schools, and the ladylike tea-table\nelysium represented in Mr. Spencer's Data of Ethics, as the final\nconsummation of progress, are exactly on a par in this\nrespect,--lubberlands, pure and simple, one and all.[7]  We look upon\nthem from this delicious mess of insanities and realities, strivings\nand deadnesses, hopes and fears, agonies and exultations, which forms\nour present state, and _tedium vitae_ is the only sentiment they awaken\nin our breasts.  To our crepuscular natures, born for the conflict, the\nRembrandtesque moral chiaroscuro, the shifting struggle of the sunbeam\nin the gloom, such pictures of light upon light are vacuous and\nexpressionless, and neither to be enjoyed nor understood.  If _this_ be\nthe whole fruit of the victory, we say; if the generations of mankind\nsuffered and laid down their lives; if prophets confessed and martyrs\nsang in the fire, and all the sacred tears were shed for no other end\nthan that a race of creatures of such unexampled insipidity should\nsucceed, and protract _in saecula saeculorum_ their contented and\ninoffensive lives,--why, at such a rate, better lose than win the\nbattle, or at all events better ring down the curtain before the last\nact of the play, so that a business that began so importantly may be\nsaved from so singularly flat a winding-up.\n{169}\nAll this is what I should instantly say, were I called on to plead for\ngnosticism; and its real friends, of whom you will presently perceive I\nam not one, would say without difficulty a great deal more.  Regarded\nas a stable finality, every outward good becomes a mere weariness to\nthe flesh.  It must be menaced, be occasionally lost, for its goodness\nto be fully felt as such.  Nay, more than occasionally lost.  No one\nknows the worth of innocence till he knows it is gone forever, and that\nmoney cannot buy it back.  Not the saint, but the sinner that\nrepenteth, is he to whom the full length and breadth, and height and\ndepth, of life's meaning is revealed.  Not the absence of vice, but\nvice there, and virtue holding her by the throat, seems the ideal human\nstate.  And there seems no reason to suppose it not a permanent human\nstate.  There is a deep truth in what the school of Schopenhauer\ninsists on,--the illusoriness of the notion of moral progress.  The\nmore brutal forms of evil that go are replaced by others more subtle\nand more poisonous.  Our moral horizon moves with us as we move, and\nnever do we draw nearer to the far-off line where the black waves and\nthe azure meet.  The final purpose of our creation seems most plausibly\nto be the greatest possible enrichment of our ethical consciousness,\nthrough the intensest play of contrasts and the widest diversity of\ncharacters.  This of course obliges some of us to be vessels of wrath,\nwhile it calls others to be vessels of honor.  But the subjectivist\npoint of view reduces all these outward distinctions to a common\ndenominator.  The wretch languishing in the felon's cell may be\ndrinking draughts of the wine of truth that will never pass the lips of\nthe so-called favorite of fortune.  And the peculiar consciousness of\n{170} each of them is an indispensable note in the great ethical\nconcert which the centuries as they roll are grinding out of the living\nheart of man.\nSo much for subjectivism!  If the dilemma of determinism be to choose\nbetween it and pessimism, I see little room for hesitation from the\nstrictly theoretical point of view.  Subjectivism seems the more\nrational scheme.  And the world may, possibly, for aught I know, be\nnothing else.  When the healthy love of life is on one, and all its\nforms and its appetites seem so unutterably real; when the most brutal\nand the most spiritual things are lit by the same sun, and each is an\nintegral part of the total richness,--why, then it seems a grudging and\nsickly way of meeting so robust a universe to shrink from any of its\nfacts and wish them not to be.  Rather take the strictly dramatic point\nof view, and treat the whole thing as a great unending romance which\nthe spirit of the universe, striving to realize its own content, is\neternally thinking out and representing to itself.[8]\nNo one, I hope, will accuse me, after I have said all this, of\nunderrating the reasons in favor of subjectivism.  And now that I\nproceed to say why those reasons, strong as they are, fail to convince\nmy own mind, I trust the presumption may be that my objections are\nstronger still.\nI frankly confess that they are of a practical order.  If we\npractically take up subjectivism in a sincere and radical manner and\nfollow its consequences, we meet with some that make us pause.  Let a\nsubjectivism {171} begin in never so severe and intellectual a way, it\nis forced by the law of its nature to develop another side of itself\nand end with the corruptest curiosity.  Once dismiss the notion that\ncertain duties are good in themselves, and that we are here to do them,\nno matter how we feel about them; once consecrate the opposite notion\nthat our performances and our violations of duty are for a common\npurpose, the attainment of subjective knowledge and feeling, and that\nthe deepening of these is the chief end of our lives,--and at what\npoint on the downward slope are we to stop?  In theology, subjectivism\ndevelops as its 'left wing' antinomianism.  In literature, its left\nwing is romanticism.  And in practical life it is either a nerveless\nsentimentality or a sensualism without bounds.\nEverywhere it fosters the fatalistic mood of mind.  It makes those who\nare already too inert more passive still; it renders wholly reckless\nthose whose energy is already in excess.  All through history we find\nhow subjectivism, as soon as it has a free career, exhausts itself in\nevery sort of spiritual, moral, and practical license.  Its optimism\nturns to an ethical indifference, which infallibly brings dissolution\nin its train.  It is perfectly safe to say now that if the Hegelian\ngnosticism, which has begun to show itself here and in Great Britain,\nwere to become a popular philosophy, as it once was in Germany, it\nwould certainly develop its left wing here as there, and produce a\nreaction of disgust.  Already I have heard a graduate of this very\nschool express in the pulpit his willingness to sin like David, if only\nhe might repent like David.  You may tell me he was only sowing his\nwild, or rather his tame, oats; and perhaps he was.  But the point is\n{172} that in the subjectivistic or gnostical philosophy oat-sowing,\nwild or tame, becomes a systematic necessity and the chief function of\nlife.  After the pure and classic truths, the exciting and rancid ones\nmust be experienced; and if the stupid virtues of the philistine herd\ndo not then come in and save society from the influence of the children\nof light, a sort of inward putrefaction becomes its inevitable doom.\nLook at the last runnings of the romantic school, as we see them in\nthat strange contemporary Parisian literature, with which we of the\nless clever countries are so often driven to rinse out our minds after\nthey have become clogged with the dulness and heaviness of our native\npursuits.  The romantic school began with the worship of subjective\nsensibility and the revolt against legality of which Rousseau was the\nfirst great prophet: and through various fluxes and refluxes, right\nwings and left wings, it stands to-day with two men of genius, M. Renan\nand M. Zola, as its principal exponents,--one speaking with its\nmasculine, and the other with what might be called its feminine, voice.\nI prefer not to think now of less noble members of the school, and the\nRenan I have in mind is of course the Renan of latest dates.  As I have\nused the term gnostic, both he and Zola are gnostics of the most\npronounced sort.  Both are athirst for the facts of life, and both\nthink the facts of human sensibility to be of all facts the most worthy\nof attention.  Both agree, moreover, that sensibility seems to be there\nfor no higher purpose,--certainly not, as the Philistines say, for the\nsake of bringing mere outward rights to pass and frustrating outward\nwrongs.  One dwells on the sensibilities for their energy, the other\nfor their sweetness; one speaks with a voice of {173} bronze, the other\nwith that of an \u00c6olian harp; one ruggedly ignores the distinction of\ngood and evil, the other plays the coquette between the craven\nunmanliness of his Philosophic Dialogues and the butterfly optimism of\nhis Souvenirs de Jeunesse.  But under the pages of both there sounds\nincessantly the hoarse bass of _vanitas vanitatum, omnia vanitas_,\nwhich the reader may hear, whenever he will, between the lines.  No\nwriter of this French romantic school has a word of rescue from the\nhour of satiety with the things of life,--the hour in which we say, \"I\ntake no pleasure in them,\"--or from the hour of terror at the world's\nvast meaningless grinding, if perchance such hours should come.  For\nterror and satiety are facts of sensibility like any others; and at\ntheir own hour they reign in their own right.  The heart of the\nromantic utterances, whether poetical, critical, or historical, is this\ninward remedilessness, what Carlyle calls this far-off whimpering of\nwail and woe.  And from this romantic state of mind there is absolutely\nno possible _theoretic_ escape.  Whether, like Renan, we look upon life\nin a more refined way, as a romance of the spirit; or whether, like the\nfriends of M. Zola, we pique ourselves on our 'scientific' and\n'analytic' character, and prefer to be cynical, and call the world a\n'roman experimental' on an infinite scale,--in either case the world\nappears to us potentially as what the same Carlyle once called it, a\nvast, gloomy, solitary Golgotha and mill of death.\nThe only escape is by the practical way.  And since I have mentioned\nthe nowadays much-reviled name of Carlyle, let me mention it once more,\nand say it is the way of his teaching.  No matter for Carlyle's life,\nno matter for a great deal of his {174} writing.  What was the most\nimportant thing he said to us?  He said: \"Hang your sensibilities!\nStop your snivelling complaints, and your equally snivelling raptures!\nLeave off your general emotional tomfoolery, and get to WORK like men!\"\nBut this means a complete rupture with the subjectivist philosophy of\nthings.  It says conduct, and not sensibility, is the ultimate fact for\nour recognition.  With the vision of certain works to be done, of\ncertain outward changes to be wrought or resisted, it says our\nintellectual horizon terminates.  No matter how we succeed in doing\nthese outward duties, whether gladly and spontaneously, or heavily and\nunwillingly, do them we somehow must; for the leaving of them undone is\nperdition.  No matter how we feel; if we are only faithful in the\noutward act and refuse to do wrong, the world will in so far be safe,\nand we quit of our debt toward it.  Take, then, the yoke upon our\nshoulders; bend our neck beneath the heavy legality of its weight;\nregard something else than our feeling as our limit, our master, and\nour law; be willing to live and die in its service,--and, at a stroke,\nwe have passed from the subjective into the objective philosophy of\nthings, much as one awakens from some feverish dream, full of bad\nlights and noises, to find one's self bathed in the sacred coolness and\nquiet of the air of the night.\nBut what is the essence of this philosophy of objective conduct, so\nold-fashioned and finite, but so chaste and sane and strong, when\ncompared with its romantic rival?  It is the recognition of limits,\nforeign and opaque to our understanding.  It is the willingness, after\nbringing about some external good, to feel at peace; for our\nresponsibility ends with the {175} performance of that duty, and the\nburden of the rest we may lay on higher powers.[9]\n\"Look to thyself, O Universe,\nThou art better and not worse,\"\nwe may say in that philosophy, the moment we have done our stroke of\nconduct, however small.  For in the view of that philosophy the\nuniverse belongs to a plurality of semi-independent forces, each one of\nwhich may help or hinder, and be helped or hindered by, the operations\nof the rest.\nBut this brings us right back, after such a long detour, to the\nquestion of indeterminism and to the conclusion of all I came here to\nsay to-night.  For the only consistent way of representing a pluralism\nand a world whose parts may affect one another through their conduct\nbeing either good or bad is the indeterministic way.  What interest,\nzest, or excitement can there be in achieving the right way, unless we\nare enabled to feel that the wrong way is also a possible and a natural\nway,--nay, more, a menacing and an imminent way?  And what sense can\nthere be in condemning ourselves for taking the wrong way, unless we\nneed have done nothing of the sort, unless the right way was open to us\nas well?  I cannot understand the willingness to act, no matter how we\nfeel, without the belief that acts are really good and bad.  I cannot\nunderstand the belief that an act is bad, without regret at its\nhappening.  I cannot understand regret without the admission of real,\ngenuine possibilities in the world.  Only _then_ is it {176} other than\na mockery to feel, after we have failed to do our best, that an\nirreparable opportunity is gone from the universe, the loss of which it\nmust forever after mourn.\nIf you insist that this is all superstition, that possibility is in the\neye of science and reason impossibility, and that if I act badly 'tis\nthat the universe was foredoomed to suffer this defect, you fall right\nback into the dilemma, the labyrinth, of pessimism and subjectivism,\nfrom out of whose toils we have just wound our way.\nNow, we are of course free to fall back, if we please.  For my own\npart, though, whatever difficulties may beset the philosophy of\nobjective right and wrong, and the indeterminism it seems to imply,\ndeterminism, with its alternative of pessimism or romanticism, contains\ndifficulties that are greater still.  But you will remember that I\nexpressly repudiated awhile ago the pretension to offer any arguments\nwhich could be coercive in a so-called scientific fashion in this\nmatter.  And I consequently find myself, at the end of this long talk,\nobliged to state my conclusions in an altogether personal way.  This\npersonal method of appeal seems to be among the very conditions of the\nproblem; and the most any one can do is to confess as candidly as he\ncan the grounds for the faith that is in him, and leave his example to\nwork on others as it may.\nLet me, then, without circumlocution say just this.  The world is\nenigmatical enough in all conscience, whatever theory we may take up\ntoward it.  The indeterminism I defend, the free-will theory of popular\nsense based on the judgment of regret, represents {177} that world as\nvulnerable, and liable to be injured by certain of its parts if they\nact wrong.  And it represents their acting wrong as a matter of\npossibility or accident, neither inevitable nor yet to be infallibly\nwarded off.  In all this, it is a theory devoid either of transparency\nor of stability.  It gives us a pluralistic, restless universe, in\nwhich no single point of view can ever take in the whole scene; and to\na mind possessed of the love of unity at any cost, it will, no doubt,\nremain forever inacceptable.  A friend with such a mind once told me\nthat the thought of my universe made him sick, like the sight of the\nhorrible motion of a mass of maggots in their carrion bed.\nBut while I freely admit that the pluralism and the restlessness are\nrepugnant and irrational in a certain way, I find that every\nalternative to them is irrational in a deeper way.  The indeterminism\nwith its maggots, if you please to speak so about it, offends only the\nnative absolutism of my intellect,--an absolutism which, after all,\nperhaps, deserves to be snubbed and kept in check.  But the determinism\nwith its necessary carrion, to continue the figure of speech, and with\nno possible maggots to eat the latter up, violates my sense of moral\nreality through and through.  When, for example, I imagine such carrion\nas the Brockton murder, I cannot conceive it as an act by which the\nuniverse, as a whole, logically and necessarily expresses its nature\nwithout shrinking from complicity with such a whole.  And I\ndeliberately refuse to keep on terms of loyalty with the universe by\nsaying blankly that the murder, since it does flow from the nature of\nthe whole, is not carrion.  There are some instinctive reactions which\n{178} I, for one, will not tamper with.  The only remaining\nalternative, the attitude of gnostical romanticism, wrenches my\npersonal instincts in quite as violent a way.  It falsifies the simple\nobjectivity of their deliverance.  It makes the goose-flesh the murder\nexcites in me a sufficient reason for the perpetration of the crime.\nIt transforms life from a tragic reality into an insincere melodramatic\nexhibition, as foul or as tawdry as any one's diseased curiosity\npleases to carry it out.  And with its consecration of the 'roman\nnaturaliste' state of mind, and its enthronement of the baser crew of\nParisian _litt\u00e9rateurs_ among the eternally indispensable organs by\nwhich the infinite spirit of things attains to that subjective\nillumination which is the task of its life, it leaves me in presence of\na sort of subjective carrion considerably more noisome than the\nobjective carrion I called it in to take away.\nNo! better a thousand times, than such systematic corruption of our\nmoral sanity, the plainest pessimism, so that it be straightforward;\nbut better far than that the world of chance.  Make as great an uproar\nabout chance as you please, I know that chance means pluralism and\nnothing more.  If some of the members of the pluralism are bad, the\nphilosophy of pluralism, whatever broad views it may deny me, permits\nme, at least, to turn to the other members with a clean breast of\naffection and an unsophisticated moral sense.  And if I still wish to\nthink of the world as a totality, it lets me feel that a world with a\nchance in it of being altogether good, even if the chance never come to\npass, is better than a world with no such chance at all.  That 'chance'\nwhose very notion I am exhorted and conjured to banish {179} from my\nview of the future as the suicide of reason concerning it, that\n'chance' is--what?  Just this,--the chance that in moral respects the\nfuture may be other and better than the past has been.  This is the\nonly chance we have any motive for supposing to exist.  Shame, rather,\non its repudiation and its denial!  For its presence is the vital air\nwhich lets the world live, the salt which keeps it sweet.\nAnd here I might legitimately stop, having expressed all I care to see\nadmitted by others to-night.  But I know that if I do stop here,\nmisapprehensions will remain in the minds of some of you, and keep all\nI have said from having its effect; so I judge it best to add a few\nmore words.\nIn the first place, in spite of all my explanations, the word 'chance'\nwill still be giving trouble.  Though you may yourselves be adverse to\nthe deterministic doctrine, you wish a pleasanter word than 'chance' to\nname the opposite doctrine by; and you very likely consider my\npreference for such a word a perverse sort of a partiality on my part.\nIt certainly _is_ a bad word to make converts with; and you wish I had\nnot thrust it so butt-foremost at you,--you wish to use a milder term.\nWell, I admit there may be just a dash of perversity in its choice.\nThe spectacle of the mere word-grabbing game played by the soft\ndeterminists has perhaps driven me too violently the other way; and,\nrather than be found wrangling with them for the good words, I am\nwilling to take the first bad one which comes along, provided it be\nunequivocal.  The question is of things, not of eulogistic names for\nthem; and the best word is the one that enables men to {180} know the\nquickest whether they disagree or not about the things.  But the word\n'chance,' with its singular negativity, is just the word for this\npurpose.  Whoever uses it instead of 'freedom,' squarely and resolutely\ngives up all pretence to control the things he says are free.  For\n_him_, he confesses that they are no better than mere chance would be.\nIt is a word of _impotence_, and is therefore the only sincere word we\ncan use, if, in granting freedom to certain things, we grant it\nhonestly, and really risk the game.  \"Who chooses me must give and\nforfeit all he hath.\"  Any other word permits of quibbling, and lets\nus, after the fashion of the soft determinists, make a pretence of\nrestoring the caged bird to liberty with one hand, while with the other\nwe anxiously tie a string to its leg to make sure it does not get\nbeyond our sight.\nBut now you will bring up your final doubt.  Does not the admission of\nsuch an unguaranteed chance or freedom preclude utterly the notion of a\nProvidence governing the world?  Does it not leave the fate of the\nuniverse at the mercy of the chance-possibilities, and so far insecure?\nDoes it not, in short, deny the craving of our nature for an ultimate\npeace behind all tempests, for a blue zenith above all clouds?\nTo this my answer must be very brief.  The belief in free-will is not\nin the least incompatible with the belief in Providence, provided you\ndo not restrict the Providence to fulminating nothing but _fatal_\ndecrees.  If you allow him to provide possibilities as well as\nactualities to the universe, and to carry on his own thinking in those\ntwo categories just as we do ours, chances may be there, uncontrolled\neven by him, and the course of the universe be really ambiguous; {181}\nand yet the end of all things may be just what he intended it to be\nfrom all eternity.\nAn analogy will make the meaning of this clear.  Suppose two men before\na chessboard,--the one a novice, the other an expert player of the\ngame.  The expert intends to beat.  But he cannot foresee exactly what\nany one actual move of his adversary may be.  He knows, however, all\nthe _possible_ moves of the latter; and he knows in advance how to meet\neach of them by a move of his own which leads in the direction of\nvictory.  And the victory infallibly arrives, after no matter how\ndevious a course, in the one predestined form of check-mate to the\nnovice's king.\nLet now the novice stand for us finite free agents, and the expert for\nthe infinite mind in which the universe lies.  Suppose the latter to be\nthinking out his universe before he actually creates it.  Suppose him\nto say, I will lead things to a certain end, but I will not _now_[10]\ndecide on all the steps thereto.  At various points, ambiguous\npossibilities shall be left {182} open, _either_ of which, at a given\ninstant, may become actual.  But whichever branch of these bifurcations\nbecome real, I know what I shall do at the _next_ bifurcation to keep\nthings from drifting away from the final result I intend.[11]\nThe creator's plan of the universe would thus be left blank as to many\nof its actual details, but all possibilities would be marked down.  The\nrealization of some of these would be left absolutely to chance; that\nis, would only be determined when the moment of realization came.\nOther possibilities would be _contingently_ determined; that is, their\ndecision would have to wait till it was seen how the matters of\nabsolute chance fell out.  But the rest of the plan, including its\nfinal upshot, would be rigorously determined once for all.  So the\ncreator himself would not need to know _all_ the details of actuality\nuntil they came; and at any time his own view of the world would be a\nview partly of facts and partly of possibilities, exactly as ours is\nnow.  Of one thing, however, he might be certain; and that is that his\nworld was safe, and that no matter how much it might zig-zag he could\nsurely bring it home at last.\n{183}\nNow, it is entirely immaterial, in this scheme, whether the creator\nleave the absolute chance-possibilities to be decided by himself, each\nwhen its proper moment arrives, or whether, on the contrary, he\nalienate this power from himself, and leave the decision out and out to\nfinite creatures such as we men are.  The great point is that the\npossibilities are really _here_.  Whether it be we who solve them, or\nhe working through us, at those soul-trying moments when fate's scales\nseem to quiver, and good snatches the victory from evil or shrinks\nnerveless from the fight, is of small account, so long as we admit that\nthe issue is decided nowhere else than here and now.  _That_ is what\ngives the palpitating reality to our moral life and makes it tingle, as\nMr. Mallock says, with so strange and elaborate an excitement.  This\nreality, this excitement, are what the determinisms, hard and soft\nalike, suppress by their denial that _anything_ is decided here and\nnow, and their dogma that all things were foredoomed and settled long\nago.  If it be so, may you and I then have been foredoomed to the error\nof continuing to believe in liberty.[12]  It is fortunate for the\nwinding up of controversy that in every discussion with determinism\nthis _argumentum ad hominem_ can be its adversary's last word.\n[1] An Address to the Harvard Divinity Students, published in the\nUnitarian Review for September, 1884.\n[2] And I may now say Charles S. Peirce,--see the Monist, for 1892-93.\n[3] \"The whole history of popular beliefs about Nature refutes the\nnotion that the thought of a universal physical order can possibly have\narisen from the purely passive reception and association of particular\nperceptions.  Indubitable as it is that men infer from known cases to\nunknown, it is equally certain that this procedure, if restricted to\nthe phenomenal materials that spontaneously offer themselves, would\nnever have led to the belief in a general uniformity, but only to the\nbelief that law and lawlessness rule the world in motley alternation.\nFrom the point of view of strict experience, nothing exists but the sum\nof particular perceptions, with their coincidences on the one hand,\ntheir contradictions on the other.\n\"That there is more order in the world than appears at first sight is\nnot discovered; _till the order is looked for_.  The first impulse to\nlook for it proceeds from practical needs: where ends must be attained,\nor produce a result.  But the practical need is only the first occasion\nfor our reflection on the conditions of true knowledge; and even were\nthere no such need, motives would still be present for carrying us\nbeyond the stage of mere association.  For not with an equal interest,\nor rather with an equal lack of interest, does man contemplate those\nnatural processes in which a thing is linked with its former mate, and\nthose in which it is linked to something else.  _The former processes\nharmonize with the conditions of his own thinking_: the latter do not.\nIn the former, his _concepts_, _general judgments_, and _inferences_\napply to reality: in the latter, they have no such application.  And\nthus the intellectual satisfaction which at first comes to him without\nreflection, at last excites in him the conscious wish to find realized\nthroughout the entire phenomenal world those rational continuities,\nuniformities, and necessities which are the fundamental element and\nguiding principle of his own thought.\"  (Sigwart, Logik, bd. 3, s. 382.)\n[4] Speaking technically, it is a word with a positive denotation, but\na connotation that is negative.  Other things must be silent about\n_what_ it is: it alone can decide that point at the moment in which it\nreveals itself.\n[5] A favorite argument against free-will is that if it be true, a\nman's murderer may as probably be his best friend as his worst enemy, a\nmother be as likely to strangle as to suckle her first-born, and all of\nus be as ready to jump from fourth-story windows as to go out of front\ndoors, etc.  Users of this argument should properly be excluded from\ndebate till they learn what the real question is.  'Free-will' does not\nsay that everything that is physically conceivable is also morally\npossible.  It merely says that of alternatives that really _tempt_ our\nwill more than one is really possible.  Of course, the alternatives\nthat do thus tempt our will are vastly fewer than the physical\npossibilities we can coldly fancy.  Persons really tempted often do\nmurder their best friends, mothers do strangle their first-born, people\ndo jump out of fourth-story windows, etc.\n[6] To a reader who says he is satisfied with a pessimism, and has no\nobjection to thinking the whole bad, I have no more to say: he makes\nfewer demands on the world than I, who, making them, wish to look a\nlittle further before I give up all hope of having them satisfied.  If,\nhowever, all he means is that the badness of some parts does not\nprevent his acceptance of a universe whose _other_ parts give him\nsatisfaction, I welcome him as an ally.  He has abandoned the notion of\nthe _Whole_, which is the essence of deterministic monism, and views\nthings as a pluralism, just as I do in this paper.\n[7] Compare Sir James Stephen's Essays by a Barrister, London, 1862,\npp. 138, 318.\n[8] Cet univers est un spectacle que Dieu se donne \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame.  Servons\nles intentions du grand chor\u00e8ge en contribuant \u00e0 rendre le spectacle\naussi brillant, aussi vari\u00e9 que possible.--RENAN.\n[9] The burden, for example, of seeing to it that the _end_ of all our\nrighteousness be some positive universal gain.\n[10] This of course leaves the creative mind subject to the law of\ntime.  And to any one who insists on the timelessness of that mind I\nhave no reply to make.  A mind to whom all time is simultaneously\npresent must see all things under the form of actuality, or under some\nform to us unknown.  If he thinks certain moments as ambiguous in their\ncontent while future, he must simultaneously know how the ambiguity\nwill have been decided when they are past.  So that none of his mental\njudgments can possibly be called hypothetical, and his world is one\nfrom which chance is excluded.  Is not, however, the timeless mind\nrather a gratuitous fiction?  And is not the notion of eternity being\ngiven at a stroke to omniscience only just another way of whacking upon\nus the block-universe, and of denying that possibilities exist?--just\nthe point to be proved.  To say that time is an illusory appearance is\nonly a roundabout manner of saying there is no real plurality, and that\nthe frame of things is an absolute unit.  Admit plurality, and time may\nbe its form.\n[11] And this of course means 'miraculous' interposition, but not\nnecessarily of the gross sort our fathers took such delight in\nrepresenting, and which has so lost its magic for us.  Emerson quotes\nsome Eastern sage as saying that if evil were really done under the\nsun, the sky would incontinently shrivel to a snakeskin and cast it out\nin spasms.  But, says Emerson, the spasms of Nature are years and\ncenturies; and it will tax man's patience to wait so long.  We may\nthink of the reserved possibilities God keeps in his own hand, under as\ninvisible and molecular and slowly self-summating a form as we please.\nWe may think of them as counteracting human agencies which he inspires\n_ad hoc_.  In short, signs and wonders and convulsions of the earth and\nsky are not the only neutralizers of obstruction to a god's plans of\nwhich it is possible to think.\n[12] As long as languages contain a future perfect tense, determinists,\nfollowing the bent of laziness or passion, the lines of least\nresistance, can reply in that tense, saying, \"It will have been fated,\"\nto the still small voice which urges an opposite course; and thus\nexcuse themselves from effort in a quite unanswerable way.\n{184}\nTHE MORAL PHILOSOPHER AND THE MORAL LIFE.[1]\nThe main purpose of this paper is to show that there is no such thing\npossible as an ethical philosophy dogmatically made up in advance.  We\nall help to determine the content of ethical philosophy so far as we\ncontribute to the race's moral life.  In other words, there can be no\nfinal truth in ethics any more than in physics, until the last man has\nhad his experience and said his say.  In the one case as in the other,\nhowever, the hypotheses which we now make while waiting, and the acts\nto which they prompt us, are among the indispensable conditions which\ndetermine what that 'say' shall be.\nFirst of all, what is the position of him who seeks an ethical\nphilosophy?  To begin with, he must be distinguished from all those who\nare satisfied to be ethical sceptics.  He _will_ not be a sceptic;\ntherefore so far from ethical scepticism being one possible fruit of\nethical philosophizing, it can only be regarded as that residual\nalternative to all philosophy which from the outset menaces every\nwould-be philosopher who may give up the quest discouraged, and\nrenounce his original aim.  That aim is to find an account of the moral\nrelations that obtain among things, which {185} will weave them into\nthe unity of a stable system, and make of the world what one may call a\ngenuine universe from the ethical point of view.  So far as the world\nresists reduction to the form of unity, so far as ethical propositions\nseem unstable, so far does the philosopher fail of his ideal.  The\nsubject-matter of his study is the ideals he finds existing in the\nworld; the purpose which guides him is this ideal of his own, of\ngetting them into a certain form.  This ideal is thus a factor in\nethical philosophy whose legitimate presence must never be overlooked;\nit is a positive contribution which the philosopher himself necessarily\nmakes to the problem.  But it is his only positive contribution.  At\nthe outset of his inquiry he ought to have no other ideals.  Were he\ninterested peculiarly in the triumph of any one kind of good, he would\n_pro tanto_ cease to be a judicial investigator, and become an advocate\nfor some limited element of the case.\nThere are three questions in ethics which must be kept apart.  Let them\nbe called respectively the _psychological_ question, the _metaphysical_\nquestion, and the _casuistic_ question.  The psychological question\nasks after the historical _origin_ of our moral ideas and judgments;\nthe metaphysical question asks what the very _meaning_ of the words\n'good,' 'ill,' and 'obligation' are; the casuistic question asks what\nis the _measure_ of the various goods and ills which men recognize, so\nthat the philosopher may settle the true order of human obligations.\nI.\nThe psychological question is for most disputants the only question.\nWhen your ordinary doctor of {186} divinity has proved to his own\nsatisfaction that an altogether unique faculty called 'conscience' must\nbe postulated to tell us what is right and what is wrong; or when your\npopular-science enthusiast has proclaimed that 'apriorism' is an\nexploded superstition, and that our moral judgments have gradually\nresulted from the teaching of the environment, each of these persons\nthinks that ethics is settled and nothing more is to be said.  The\nfamiliar pair of names, Intuitionist and Evolutionist, so commonly used\nnow to connote all possible differences in ethical opinion, really\nrefer to the psychological question alone.  The discussion of this\nquestion hinges so much upon particular details that it is impossible\nto enter upon it at all within the limits of this paper.  I will\ntherefore only express dogmatically my own belief, which is this,--that\nthe Benthams, the Mills, and the Barns have done a lasting service in\ntaking so many of our human ideals and showing how they must have\narisen from the association with acts of simple bodily pleasures and\nreliefs from pain.  Association with many remote pleasures will\nunquestionably make a thing significant of goodness in our minds; and\nthe more vaguely the goodness is conceived of, the more mysterious will\nits source appear to be.  But it is surely impossible to explain all\nour sentiments and preferences in this simple way.  The more minutely\npsychology studies human nature, the more clearly it finds there traces\nof secondary affections, relating the impressions of the environment\nwith one another and with our impulses in quite different ways from\nthose mere associations of coexistence and succession which are\npractically all that pure empiricism can admit.  Take the love of\ndrunkenness; take bashfulness, the terror {187} of high places, the\ntendency to sea-sickness, to faint at the sight of blood, the\nsusceptibility to musical sounds; take the emotion of the comical, the\npassion for poetry, for mathematics, or for metaphysics,--no one of\nthese things can be wholly explained by either association or utility.\nThey _go with_ other things that can be so explained, no doubt; and\nsome of them are prophetic of future utilities, since there is nothing\nin us for which some use may not be found.  But their origin is in\nincidental complications to our cerebral structure, a structure whose\noriginal features arose with no reference to the perception of such\ndiscords and harmonies as these.\nWell, a vast number of our moral perceptions also are certainly of this\nsecondary and brain-born kind.  They deal with directly felt fitnesses\nbetween things, and often fly in the teeth of all the prepossessions of\nhabit and presumptions of utility.  The moment you get beyond the\ncoarser and more commonplace moral maxims, the Decalogues and Poor\nRichard's Almanacs, you fall into schemes and positions which to the\neye of common-sense are fantastic and overstrained.  The sense for\nabstract justice which some persons have is as excentric a variation,\nfrom the natural-history point of view, as is the passion for music or\nfor the higher philosophical consistencies which consumes the soul of\nothers.  The feeling of the inward dignity of certain spiritual\nattitudes, as peace, serenity, simplicity, veracity; and of the\nessential vulgarity of others, as querulousness, anxiety, egoistic\nfussiness, etc.,--are quite inexplicable except by an innate preference\nof the more ideal attitude for its own pure sake.  The nobler thing\n_tastes_ better, and that is all that we can say.  {188} 'Experience'\nof consequences may truly teach us what things are _wicked_, but what\nhave consequences to do with what is _mean_ and _vulgar_?  If a man has\nshot his wife's paramour, by reason of what subtile repugnancy in\nthings is it that we are so disgusted when we hear that the wife and\nthe husband have made it up and are living comfortably together again?\nOr if the hypothesis were offered us of a world in which Messrs.\nFourier's and Bellamy's and Morris's Utopias should all be outdone, and\nmillions kept permanently happy on the one simple condition that a\ncertain lost soul on the far-off edge of things should lead a life of\nlonely torture, what except a specifical and independent sort of\nemotion can it be which would make us immediately feel, even though an\nimpulse arose within us to clutch at the happiness so offered, how\nhideous a thing would be its enjoyment when deliberately accepted as\nthe fruit of such a bargain?  To what, once more, but subtile\nbrain-born feelings of discord can be due all these recent protests\nagainst the entire race-tradition of retributive justice?--I refer to\nTolstoi with his ideas of non-resistance, to Mr. Bellamy with his\nsubstitution of oblivion for repentance (in his novel of Dr.\nHeidenhain's Process), to M. Guyau with his radical condemnation of the\npunitive ideal.  All these subtileties of the moral sensibility go as\nmuch beyond what can be ciphered out from the 'laws of association' as\nthe delicacies of sentiment possible between a pair of young lovers go\nbeyond such precepts of the 'etiquette to be observed during\nengagement' as are printed in manuals of social form.\nNo!  Purely inward forces are certainly at work here.  All the higher,\nmore penetrating ideals are {189} revolutionary.  They present\nthemselves far less in the guise of effects of past experience than in\nthat of probable causes of future experience, factors to which the\nenvironment and the lessons it has so far taught as must learn to bend.\nThis is all I can say of the psychological question now.  In the last\nchapter of a recent work[2] I have sought to prove in a general way the\nexistence, in our thought, of relations which do not merely repeat the\ncouplings of experience.  Our ideals have certainly many sources.  They\nare not all explicable as signifying corporeal pleasures to be gained,\nand pains to be escaped.  And for having so constantly perceived this\npsychological fact, we must applaud the intuitionist school.  Whether\nor not such applause must be extended to that school's other\ncharacteristics will appear as we take up the following questions.\nThe next one in order is the metaphysical question, of what we mean by\nthe words 'obligation,' 'good,' and 'ill.'\nII.\nFirst of all, it appears that such words can have no application or\nrelevancy in a world in which no sentient life exists.  Imagine an\nabsolutely material world, containing only physical and chemical facts,\nand existing from eternity without a God, without even an interested\nspectator: would there be any sense in saying of that world that one of\nits states is better than another?  Or if there were two such worlds\npossible, would there be any rhyme or reason in calling one good and\nthe other bad,--good or {190} bad positively, I mean, and apart from\nthe fact that one might relate itself better than the other to the\nphilosopher's private interests?  But we must leave these private\ninterests out of the account, for the philosopher is a mental fact, and\nwe are asking whether goods and evils and obligations exist in physical\nfacts _per se_.  Surely there is no _status_ for good and evil to exist\nin, in a purely insentient world.  How can one physical fact,\nconsidered simply as a physical fact, be 'better' than another?\nBetterness is not a physical relation.  In its mere material capacity,\na thing can no more be good or bad than it can be pleasant or painful.\nGood for what?  Good for the production of another physical fact, do\nyou say?  But what in a purely physical universe demands the production\nof that other fact?  Physical facts simply _are_ or are _not_; and\nneither when present or absent, can they be supposed to make demands.\nIf they do, they can only do so by having desires; and then they have\nceased to be purely physical facts, and have become facts of conscious\nsensibility.  Goodness, badness, and obligation must be _realised_\nsomewhere in order really to exist; and the first step in ethical\nphilosophy is to see that no merely inorganic 'nature of things' can\nrealize them.  Neither moral relations nor the moral law can swing _in\nvacuo_.  Their only habitat can be a mind which feels them; and no\nworld composed of merely physical facts can possibly be a world to\nwhich ethical propositions apply.\nThe moment one sentient being, however, is made a part of the universe,\nthere is a chance for goods and evils really to exist.  Moral relations\nnow have their _status_, in that being's consciousness.  So far as he\nfeels anything to be good, he _makes_ it good.  It {191} _is_ good, for\nhim; and being good for him, is absolutely good, for he is the sole\ncreator of values in that universe, and outside of his opinion things\nhave no moral character at all.\nIn such a universe as that it would of course be absurd to raise the\nquestion of whether the solitary thinker's judgments of good and ill\nare true or not.  Truth supposes a standard outside of the thinker to\nwhich he must conform; but here the thinker is a sort of divinity,\nsubject to no higher judge.  Let us call the supposed universe which he\ninhabits a _moral solitude_.  In such a moral solitude it is clear that\nthere can be no outward obligation, and that the only trouble the\ngod-like thinker is liable to have will be over the consistency of his\nown several ideals with one another.  Some of these will no doubt be\nmore pungent and appealing than the rest, their goodness will have a\nprofounder, more penetrating taste; they will return to haunt him with\nmore obstinate regrets if violated.  So the thinker will have to order\nhis life with them as its chief determinants, or else remain inwardly\ndiscordant and unhappy.  Into whatever equilibrium he may settle,\nthough, and however he may straighten out his system, it will be a\nright system; for beyond the facts of his own subjectivity there is\nnothing moral in the world.\nIf now we introduce a second thinker with his likes and dislikes into\nthe universe, the ethical situation becomes much more complex, and\nseveral possibilities are immediately seen to obtain.\nOne of these is that the thinkers may ignore each other's attitude\nabout good and evil altogether, and each continue to indulge his own\npreferences, indifferent to what the other may feel or do.  In such a\n{192} case we have a world with twice as much of the ethical quality in\nit as our moral solitude, only it is without ethical unity.  The same\nobject is good or bad there, according as you measure it by the view\nwhich this one or that one of the thinkers takes.  Nor can you find any\npossible ground in such a world for saying that one thinker's opinion\nis more correct than the other's, or that either has the truer moral\nsense.  Such a world, in short, is not a moral universe but a moral\ndualism.  Not only is there no single point of view within it from\nwhich the values of things can be unequivocally judged, but there is\nnot even a demand for such a point of view, since the two thinkers are\nsupposed to be indifferent to each other's thoughts and acts.  Multiply\nthe thinkers into a pluralism, and we find realized for us in the\nethical sphere something like that world which the antique sceptics\nconceived of,--in which individual minds are the measures of all\nthings, and in which no one 'objective' truth, but only a multitude of\n'subjective' opinions, can be found.\nBut this is the kind of world with which the philosopher, so long as he\nholds to the hope of a philosophy, will not put up.  Among the various\nideals represented, there must be, he thinks, some which have the more\ntruth or authority; and to these the others _ought_ to yield, so that\nsystem and subordination may reign.  Here in the word 'ought' the\nnotion of _obligation_ comes emphatically into view, and the next thing\nin order must be to make its meaning clear.\nSince the outcome of the discussion so far has been to show us that\nnothing can be good or right except {193} so far as some consciousness\nfeels it to be good or thinks it to be right, we perceive on the very\nthreshold that the real superiority and authority which are postulated\nby the philosopher to reside in some of the opinions, and the really\ninferior character which he supposes must belong to others, cannot be\nexplained by any abstract moral 'nature of things' existing\nantecedently to the concrete thinkers themselves with their ideals.\nLike the positive attributes good and bad, the comparative ones better\nand worse must be _realised_ in order to be real.  If one ideal\njudgment be objectively better than another, that betterness must be\nmade flesh by being lodged concretely in some one's actual perception.\nIt cannot float in the atmosphere, for it is not a sort of\nmeteorological phenomenon, like the aurora borealis or the zodiacal\nlight.  Its _esse_ is _percipi_, like the _esse_ of the ideals\nthemselves between which it obtains.  The philosopher, therefore, who\nseeks to know which ideal ought to have supreme weight and which one\nought to be subordinated, must trace the _ought_ itself to the _de\nfacto_ constitution of some existing consciousness, behind which, as\none of the data of the universe, he as a purely ethical philosopher is\nunable to go.  This consciousness must make the one ideal right by\nfeeling it to be right, the other wrong by feeling it to be wrong.  But\nnow what particular consciousness in the universe _can_ enjoy this\nprerogative of obliging others to conform to a rule which it lays down?\nIf one of the thinkers were obviously divine, while all the rest were\nhuman, there would probably be no practical dispute about the matter.\nThe divine thought would be the model, to which the others should\nconform.  But still the theoretic question {194} would remain, What is\nthe ground of the obligation, even here?\nIn our first essays at answering this question, there is an inevitable\ntendency to slip into an assumption which ordinary men follow when they\nare disputing with one another about questions of good and bad.  They\nimagine an abstract moral order in which the objective truth resides;\nand each tries to prove that this pre-existing order is more accurately\nreflected in his own ideas than in those of his adversary.  It is\nbecause one disputant is backed by this overarching abstract order that\nwe think the other should submit.  Even so, when it is a question no\nlonger of two finite thinkers, but of God and ourselves,--we follow our\nusual habit, and imagine a sort of _de jure_ relation, which antedates\nand overarches the mere facts, and would make it right that we should\nconform our thoughts to God's thoughts, even though he made no claim to\nthat effect, and though we preferred _de facto_ to go on thinking for\nourselves.\nBut the moment we take a steady look at the question, _we see not only\nthat without a claim actually made by some concrete person there can be\nno obligation, but that there is some obligation wherever there is a\nclaim_.  Claim and obligation are, in fact, coextensive terms; they\ncover each other exactly.  Our ordinary attitude of regarding ourselves\nas subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true 'in\nthemselves,' is therefore either an out-and-out superstition, or else\nit must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real\nThinker in whose actual demand upon us to think as he does our\nobligation must be ultimately based.  In a theistic-ethical philosophy\nthat thinker in question is, of {195} course, the Deity to whom the\nexistence of the universe is due.\nI know well how hard it is for those who are accustomed to what I have\ncalled the superstitious view, to realize that every _de facto_ claim\ncreates in so far forth an obligation.  We inveterately think that\nsomething which we call the 'validity' of the claim is what gives to it\nits obligatory character, and that this validity is something outside\nof the claim's mere existence as a matter of fact.  It rains down upon\nthe claim, we think, from some sublime dimension of being, which the\nmoral law inhabits, much as upon the steel of the compass-needle the\ninfluence of the Pole rains down from out of the starry heavens.  But\nagain, how can such an inorganic abstract character of imperativeness,\nadditional to the imperativeness which is in the concrete claim itself,\n_exist_?  Take any demand, however slight, which any creature, however\nweak, may make.  Ought it not, for its own sole sake, to be satisfied?\nIf not, prove why not.  The only possible kind of proof you could\nadduce would be the exhibition of another creature who should make a\ndemand that ran the other way.  The only possible reason there can be\nwhy any phenomenon ought to exist is that such a phenomenon actually is\ndesired.  Any desire is imperative to the extent of its amount; it\n_makes_ itself valid by the fact that it exists at all.  Some desires,\ntruly enough, are small desires; they are put forward by insignificant\npersons, and we customarily make light of the obligations which they\nbring.  But the fact that such personal demands as these impose small\nobligations does not keep the largest obligations from being personal\ndemands.\nIf we must talk impersonally, to be sure we can say {196} that 'the\nuniverse' requires, exacts, or makes obligatory such or such an action,\nwhenever it expresses itself through the desires of such or such a\ncreature.  But it is better not to talk about the universe in this\npersonified way, unless we believe in a universal or divine\nconsciousness which actually exists.  If there be such a consciousness,\nthen its demands carry the most of obligation simply because they are\nthe greatest in amount.  But it is even then not _abstractly right_\nthat we should respect them.  It is only concretely right,--or right\nafter the fact, and by virtue of the fact, that they are actually made.\nSuppose we do not respect them, as seems largely to be the case in this\nqueer world.  That ought not to be, we say; that is wrong.  But in what\nway is this fact of wrongness made more acceptable or intelligible when\nwe imagine it to consist rather in the laceration of an _\u00e0 priori_\nideal order than in the disappointment of a living personal God?  Do\nwe, perhaps, think that we cover God and protect him and make his\nimpotence over us less ultimate, when we back him up with this _\u00e0\npriori_ blanket from which he may draw some warmth of further appeal?\nBut the only force of appeal to _us_, which either a living God or an\nabstract ideal order can wield, is found in the 'everlasting ruby\nvaults' of our own human hearts, as they happen to beat responsive and\nnot irresponsive to the claim.  So far as they do feel it when made by\na living consciousness, it is life answering to life.  A claim thus\nlivingly acknowledged is acknowledged with a solidity and fulness which\nno thought of an 'ideal' backing can render more complete; while if, on\nthe other hand, the heart's response is withheld, the stubborn\nphenomenon is there of an impotence in the claims {197} which the\nuniverse embodies, which no talk about an eternal nature of things can\ngloze over or dispel.  An ineffective _\u00e0 priori_ order is as impotent a\nthing as an ineffective God; and in the eye of philosophy, it is as\nhard a thing to explain.\nWe may now consider that what we distinguished as the metaphysical\nquestion in ethical philosophy is sufficiently answered, and that we\nhave learned what the words 'good,' 'bad,' and 'obligation' severally\nmean.  They mean no absolute natures, independent of personal support.\nThey are objects of feeling and desire, which have no foothold or\nanchorage in Being, apart from the existence of actually living minds.\nWherever such minds exist, with judgments of good and ill, and demands\nupon one another, there is an ethical world in its essential features.\nWere all other things, gods and men and starry heavens, blotted out\nfrom this universe, and were there left but one rock with two loving\nsouls upon it, that rock would have as thoroughly moral a constitution\nas any possible world which the eternities and immensities could\nharbor.  It would be a tragic constitution, because the rock's\ninhabitants would die.  But while they lived, there would be real good\nthings and real bad things in the universe; there would be obligations,\nclaims, and expectations; obediences, refusals, and disappointments;\ncompunctions and longings for harmony to come again, and inward peace\nof conscience when it was restored; there would, in short, be a moral\nlife, whose active energy would have no limit but the intensity of\ninterest in each other with which the hero and heroine might be endowed.\n{198}\nWe, on this terrestrial globe, so far as the visible facts go, are just\nlike the inhabitants of such a rock.  Whether a God exist, or whether\nno God exist, in yon blue heaven above us bent, we form at any rate an\nethical republic here below.  And the first reflection which this leads\nto is that ethics have as genuine and real a foothold in a universe\nwhere the highest consciousness is human, as in a universe where there\nis a God as well.  'The religion of humanity' affords a basis for\nethics as well as theism does.  Whether the purely human system can\ngratify the philosopher's demand as well as the other is a different\nquestion, which we ourselves must answer ere we close.\nIII.\nThe last fundamental question in Ethics was, it will be remembered, the\n_casuistic_ question.  Here we are, in a world where the existence of a\ndivine thinker has been and perhaps always will be doubted by some of\nthe lookers-on, and where, in spite of the presence of a large number\nof ideals in which human beings agree, there are a mass of others about\nwhich no general consensus obtains.  It is hardly necessary to present\na literary picture of this, for the facts are too well known.  The wars\nof the flesh and the spirit in each man, the concupiscences of\ndifferent individuals pursuing the same unshareable material or social\nprizes, the ideals which contrast so according to races, circumstances,\ntemperaments, philosophical beliefs, etc.,--all form a maze of\napparently inextricable confusion with no obvious Ariadne's thread to\nlead one out.  Yet the philosopher, just because he is a philosopher,\nadds his own peculiar ideal to the confusion {199} (with which if he\nwere willing to be a sceptic he would be passably content), and insists\nthat over all these individual opinions there is a _system of truth_\nwhich he can discover if he only takes sufficient pains.\nWe stand ourselves at present in the place of that philosopher, and\nmust not fail to realize all the features that the situation comports.\nIn the first place we will not be sceptics; we hold to it that there is\na truth to be ascertained.  But in the second place we have just gained\nthe insight that that truth cannot be a self-proclaiming set of laws,\nor an abstract 'moral reason,' but can only exist in act, or in the\nshape of an opinion held by some thinker really to be found.  There is,\nhowever, no visible thinker invested with authority.  Shall we then\nsimply proclaim our own ideals as the lawgiving ones?  No; for if we\nare true philosophers we must throw our own spontaneous ideals, even\nthe dearest, impartially in with that total mass of ideals which are\nfairly to be judged.  But how then can we as philosophers ever find a\ntest; how avoid complete moral scepticism on the one hand, and on the\nother escape bringing a wayward personal standard of our own along with\nus, on which we simply pin our faith?\nThe dilemma is a hard one, nor does it grow a bit more easy as we\nrevolve it in our minds.  The entire undertaking of the philosopher\nobliges him to seek an impartial test.  That test, however, must be\nincarnated in the demand of some actually existent person; and how can\nhe pick out the person save by an act in which his own sympathies and\nprepossessions are implied?\nOne method indeed presents itself, and has as a matter of history been\ntaken by the more serious {200} ethical schools.  If the heap of things\ndemanded proved on inspection less chaotic than at first they seemed,\nif they furnished their own relative test and measure, then the\ncasuistic problem would be solved.  If it were found that all goods\n_qu\u00e2_ goods contained a common essence, then the amount of this essence\ninvolved in any one good would show its rank in the scale of goodness,\nand order could be quickly made; for this essence would be _the_ good\nupon which all thinkers were agreed, the relatively objective and\nuniversal good that the philosopher seeks.  Even his own private ideals\nwould be measured by their share of it, and find their rightful place\namong the rest.\nVarious essences of good have thus been found and proposed as bases of\nthe ethical system.  Thus, to be a mean between two extremes; to be\nrecognized by a special intuitive faculty; to make the agent happy for\nthe moment; to make others as well as him happy in the long run; to add\nto his perfection or dignity; to harm no one; to follow from reason or\nflow from universal law; to be in accordance with the will of God; to\npromote the survival of the human species on this planet,--are so many\ntests, each of which has been maintained by somebody to constitute the\nessence of all good things or actions so far as they are good.\nNo one of the measures that have been actually proposed has, however,\ngiven general satisfaction.  Some are obviously not universally present\nin all cases,--_e. g._, the character of harming no one, or that of\nfollowing a universal law; for the best course is often cruel; and many\nacts are reckoned good on the sole condition that they be exceptions,\nand serve not as examples of a universal law.  Other {201} characters,\nsuch as following the will of God, are unascertainable and vague.\nOthers again, like survival, are quite indeterminate in their\nconsequences, and leave us in the lurch where we most need their help:\na philosopher of the Sioux Nation, for example, will be certain to use\nthe survival-criterion in a very different way from ourselves.  The\nbest, on the whole, of these marks and measures of goodness seems to be\nthe capacity to bring happiness.  But in order not to break down\nfatally, this test must be taken to cover innumerable acts and impulses\nthat never _aim_ at happiness; so that, after all, in seeking for a\nuniversal principle we inevitably are carried onward to the most\nuniversal principle,--that _the essence of good is simply to satisfy\ndemand_.  The demand may be for anything under the sun.  There is\nreally no more ground for supposing that all our demands can be\naccounted for by one universal underlying kind of motive than there is\nground for supposing that all physical phenomena are cases of a single\nlaw.  The elementary forces in ethics are probably as plural as those\nof physics are.  The various ideals have no common character apart from\nthe fact that they are ideals.  No single abstract principle can be so\nused as to yield to the philosopher anything like a scientifically\naccurate and genuinely useful casuistic scale.\nA look at another peculiarity of the ethical universe, as we find it,\nwill still further show us the philosopher's perplexities.  As a purely\ntheoretic problem, namely, the casuistic question would hardly ever\ncome up at all.  If the ethical philosopher were only asking after the\nbest _imaginable_ system of goods he would indeed have an easy task;\nfor all demands as {202} such are _prim\u00e2 facie_ respectable, and the\nbest simply imaginary world would be one in which _every_ demand was\ngratified as soon as made.  Such a world would, however, have to have a\nphysical constitution entirely different from that of the one which we\ninhabit.  It would need not only a space, but a time, 'of\n_n_-dimensions,' to include all the acts and experiences incompatible\nwith one another here below, which would then go on in\nconjunction,--such as spending our money, yet growing rich; taking our\nholiday, yet getting ahead with our work; shooting and fishing, yet\ndoing no hurt to the beasts; gaining no end of experience, yet keeping\nour youthful freshness of heart; and the like.  There can be no\nquestion that such a system of things, however brought about, would be\nthe absolutely ideal system; and that if a philosopher could create\nuniverses _\u00e0 priori_, and provide all the mechanical conditions, that\nis the sort of universe which he should unhesitatingly create.\nBut this world of ours is made on an entirely different pattern, and\nthe casuistic question here is most tragically practical.  The actually\npossible in this world is vastly narrower than all that is demanded;\nand there is always a _pinch_ between the ideal and the actual which\ncan only be got through by leaving part of the ideal behind.  There is\nhardly a good which we can imagine except as competing for the\npossession of the same bit of space and time with some other imagined\ngood.  Every end of desire that presents itself appears exclusive of\nsome other end of desire.  Shall a man drink and smoke, _or_ keep his\nnerves in condition?--he cannot do both.  Shall he follow his fancy for\nAmelia, _or_ for Henrietta?--both cannot be the choice of his heart.\nShall he have the {203} dear old Republican party, _or_ a spirit of\nunsophistication in public affairs?--he cannot have both, etc.  So that\nthe ethical philosopher's demand for the right scale of subordination\nin ideals is the fruit of an altogether practical need.  Some part of\nthe ideal must be butchered, and he needs to know which part.  It is a\ntragic situation, and no mere speculative conundrum, with which he has\nto deal.\nNow we are blinded to the real difficulty of the philosopher's task by\nthe fact that we are born into a society whose ideals are largely\nordered already.  If we follow the ideal which is conventionally\nhighest, the others which we butcher either die and do not return to\nhaunt us; or if they come back and accuse us of murder, every one\napplauds us for turning to them a deaf ear.  In other words, our\nenvironment encourages us not to be philosophers but partisans.  The\nphilosopher, however, cannot, so long as he clings to his own ideal of\nobjectivity, rule out any ideal from being heard.  He is confident, and\nrightly confident, that the simple taking counsel of his own intuitive\npreferences would be certain to end in a mutilation of the fulness of\nthe truth.  The poet Heine is said to have written 'Bunsen' in the\nplace of 'Gott' in his copy of that author's work entitled \"God in\nHistory,\" so as to make it read 'Bunsen in der Geschichte.'  Now, with\nno disrespect to the good and learned Baron, is it not safe to say that\nany single philosopher, however wide his sympathies, must be just such\na Bunsen in der Geschichte of the moral world, so soon as he attempts\nto put his own ideas of order into that howling mob of desires, each\nstruggling to get breathing-room for the ideal to which it clings?  The\nvery best of men must not only be insensible, but {204} be ludicrously\nand peculiarly insensible, to many goods.  As a militant, fighting\nfree-handed that the goods to which he is sensible may not be submerged\nand lost from out of life, the philosopher, like every other human\nbeing, is in a natural position.  But think of Zeno and of Epicurus,\nthink of Calvin and of Paley, think of Kant and Schopenhauer, of\nHerbert Spencer and John Henry Newman, no longer as one-sided champions\nof special ideals, but as schoolmasters deciding what all must\nthink,--and what more grotesque topic could a satirist wish for on\nwhich to exercise his pen?  The fabled attempt of Mrs. Partington to\narrest the rising tide of the North Atlantic with her broom was a\nreasonable spectacle compared with their effort to substitute the\ncontent of their clean-shaven systems for that exuberant mass of goods\nwith which all human nature is in travail, and groaning to bring to the\nlight of day.  Think, furthermore, of such individual moralists, no\nlonger as mere schoolmasters, but as pontiffs armed with the temporal\npower, and having authority in every concrete case of conflict to order\nwhich good shall be butchered and which shall be suffered to\nsurvive,--and the notion really turns one pale.  All one's slumbering\nrevolutionary instincts waken at the thought of any single moralist\nwielding such powers of life and death.  Better chaos forever than an\norder based on any closet-philosopher's rule, even though he were the\nmost enlightened possible member of his tribe.  No! if the philosopher\nis to keep his judicial position, he must never become one of the\nparties to the fray.\nWhat can he do, then, it will now be asked, except to fall back on\nscepticism and give up the notion of being a philosopher at all?\n{205}\nBut do we not already see a perfectly definite path of escape which is\nopen to him just because he is a philosopher, and not the champion of\none particular ideal?  Since everything which is demanded is by that\nfact a good, must not the guiding principle for ethical philosophy\n(since all demands conjointly cannot be satisfied in this poor world)\nbe simply to satisfy at all times _as many demands as we can_?  That\nact must be the best act, accordingly, which makes for the best whole,\nin the sense of awakening the least sum of dissatisfactions.  In the\ncasuistic scale, therefore, those ideals must be written highest which\n_prevail at the least cost_, or by whose realization the least possible\nnumber of other ideals are destroyed.  Since victory and defeat there\nmust be, the victory to be philosophically prayed for is that of the\nmore inclusive side,--of the side which even in the hour of triumph\nwill to some degree do justice to the ideals in which the vanquished\nparty's interests lay.  The course of history is nothing but the story\nof men's struggles from generation to generation to find the more and\nmore inclusive order.  _Invent some manner_ of realizing your own\nideals which will also satisfy the alien demands,--that and that only\nis the path of peace!  Following this path, society has shaken itself\ninto one sort of relative equilibrium after another by a series of\nsocial discoveries quite analogous to those of science.  Polyandry and\npolygamy and slavery, private warfare and liberty to kill, judicial\ntorture and arbitrary royal power have slowly succumbed to actually\naroused complaints; and though some one's ideals are unquestionably the\nworse off for each improvement, yet a vastly greater total number of\nthem find shelter in our civilized society than in the older {206}\nsavage ways.  So far then, and up to date, the casuistic scale is made\nfor the philosopher already far better than he can ever make it for\nhimself.  An experiment of the most searching kind has proved that the\nlaws and usages of the land are what yield the maximum of satisfaction\nto the thinkers taken all together.  The presumption in cases of\nconflict must always be in favor of the conventionally recognized good.\nThe philosopher must be a conservative, and in the construction of his\ncasuistic scale must put the things most in accordance with the customs\nof the community on top.\nAnd yet if he be a true philosopher he must see that there is nothing\nfinal in any actually given equilibrium of human ideals, but that, as\nour present laws and customs have fought and conquered other past ones,\nso they will in their turn be overthrown by any newly discovered order\nwhich will hush up the complaints that they still give rise to, without\nproducing others louder still.  \"Rules are made for man, not man for\nrules,\"--that one sentence is enough to immortalize Green's Prolegomena\nto Ethics.  And although a man always risks much when he breaks away\nfrom established rules and strives to realize a larger ideal whole than\nthey permit, yet the philosopher must allow that it is at all times\nopen to any one to make the experiment, provided he fear not to stake\nhis life and character upon the throw.  The pinch is always here.  Pent\nin under every system of moral rules are innumerable persons whom it\nweighs upon, and goods which it represses; and these are always\nrumbling and grumbling in the background, and ready for any issue by\nwhich they may get free.  See the abuses which the {207} institution of\nprivate property covers, so that even to-day it is shamelessly asserted\namong us that one of the prime functions of the national government is\nto help the adroiter citizens to grow rich.  See the unnamed and\nunnamable sorrows which the tyranny, on the whole so beneficent, of the\nmarriage-institution brings to so many, both of the married and the\nunwed.  See the wholesale loss of opportunity under our _r\u00e9gime_ of\nso-called equality and industrialism, with the drummer and the\ncounter-jumper in the saddle, for so many faculties and graces which\ncould flourish in the feudal world.  See our kindliness for the humble\nand the outcast, how it wars with that stern weeding-out which until\nnow has been the condition of every perfection in the breed.  See\neverywhere the struggle and the squeeze; and ever-lastingly the problem\nhow to make them less.  The anarchists, nihilists, and free-lovers; the\nfree-silverites, socialists, and single-tax men; the free-traders and\ncivil-service reformers; the prohibitionists and anti-vivisectionists;\nthe radical darwinians with their idea of the suppression of the\nweak,--these and all the conservative sentiments of society arrayed\nagainst them, are simply deciding through actual experiment by what\nsort of conduct the maximum amount of good can be gained and kept in\nthis world.  These experiments are to be judged, not _\u00e0 priori_, but by\nactually finding, after the fact of their making, how much more outcry\nor how much appeasement comes about.  What closet-solutions can\npossibly anticipate the result of trials made on such a scale?  Or what\ncan any superficial theorist's judgment be worth, in a world where\nevery one of hundreds of ideals has its special champion already\nprovided {208} in the shape of some genius expressly born to feel it,\nand to fight to death in its behalf?  The pure philosopher can only\nfollow the windings of the spectacle, confident that the line of least\nresistance will always be towards the richer and the more inclusive\narrangement, and that by one tack after another some approach to the\nkingdom of heaven is incessantly made.\nIV.\nAll this amounts to saying that, so far as the casuistic question goes,\nethical science is just like physical science, and instead of being\ndeducible all at once from abstract principles, must simply bide its\ntime, and be ready to revise its conclusions from day to day.  The\npresumption of course, in both sciences, always is that the vulgarly\naccepted opinions are true, and the right casuistic order that which\npublic opinion believes in; and surely it would be folly quite as\ngreat, in most of us, to strike out independently and to aim at\noriginality in ethics as in physics.  Every now and then, however, some\none is born with the right to be original, and his revolutionary\nthought or action may bear prosperous fruit.  He may replace old 'laws\nof nature' by better ones; he may, by breaking old moral rules in a\ncertain place, bring in a total condition of things more ideal than\nwould have followed had the rules been kept.\nOn the whole, then, we must conclude that no philosophy of ethics is\npossible in the old-fashioned absolute sense of the term.  Everywhere\nthe ethical philosopher must wait on facts.  The thinkers who create\nthe ideals come he knows not whence, their sensibilities are evolved he\nknows not how; and the {209} question as to which of two conflicting\nideals will give the best universe then and there, can be answered by\nhim only through the aid of the experience of other men.  I said some\ntime ago, in treating of the 'first' question, that the intuitional\nmoralists deserve credit for keeping most clearly to the psychological\nfacts.  They do much to spoil this merit on the whole, however, by\nmixing with it that dogmatic temper which, by absolute distinctions and\nunconditional 'thou shalt nots,' changes a growing, elastic, and\ncontinuous life into a superstitious system of relics and dead bones.\nIn point of fact, there are no absolute evils, and there are no\nnon-moral goods; and the _highest_ ethical life--however few may be\ncalled to bear its burdens--consists at all times in the breaking of\nrules which have grown too narrow for the actual case.  There is but\none unconditional commandment, which is that we should seek\nincessantly, with fear and trembling, so to vote and to act as to bring\nabout the very largest total universe of good which we can see.\nAbstract rules indeed can help; but they help the less in proportion as\nour intuitions are more piercing, and our vocation is the stronger for\nthe moral life.  For every real dilemma is in literal strictness a\nunique situation; and the exact combination of ideals realized and\nideals disappointed which each decision creates is always a universe\nwithout a precedent, and for which no adequate previous rule exists.\nThe philosopher, then, _qu\u00e2_ philosopher, is no better able to\ndetermine the best universe in the concrete emergency than other men.\nHe sees, indeed, somewhat better than most men, what the question\nalways is,--not a question of this good or that good simply taken, but\nof the two total {210} universes with which these goods respectively\nbelong.  He knows that he must vote always for the richer universe, for\nthe good which seems most organizable, most fit to enter into complex\ncombinations, most apt to be a member of a more inclusive whole.  But\nwhich particular universe this is he cannot know for certain in\nadvance; he only knows that if he makes a bad mistake the cries of the\nwounded will soon inform him of the fact.  In all this the philosopher\nis just like the rest of us non-philosophers, so far as we are just and\nsympathetic instinctively, and so far as we are open to the voice of\ncomplaint.  His function is in fact indistinguishable from that of the\nbest kind of statesman at the present day.  His books upon ethics,\ntherefore, so far as they truly touch the moral life, must more and\nmore ally themselves with a literature which is confessedly tentative\nand suggestive rather than dogmatic,--I mean with novels and dramas of\nthe deeper sort, with sermons, with books on statecraft and\nphilanthropy and social and economical reform.  Treated in this way\nethical treatises may be voluminous and luminous as well; but they\nnever can be _final_, except in their abstractest and vaguest features;\nand they must more and more abandon the old-fashioned, clear-cut, and\nwould-be 'scientific' form.\nV.\nThe chief of all the reasons why concrete ethics cannot be final is\nthat they have to wait on metaphysical and theological beliefs.  I said\nsome time back that real ethical relations existed in a purely human\nworld.  They would exist even in what we called a moral solitude if the\nthinker had various {211} ideals which took hold of him in turn.  His\nself of one day would make demands on his self of another; and some of\nthe demands might be urgent and tyrannical, while others were gentle\nand easily put aside.  We call the tyrannical demands _imperatives_.\nIf we ignore these we do not hear the last of it.  The good which we\nhave wounded returns to plague us with interminable crops of\nconsequential damages, compunctions, and regrets.  Obligation can thus\nexist inside a single thinker's consciousness; and perfect peace can\nabide with him only so far as he lives according to some sort of a\ncasuistic scale which keeps his more imperative goods on top.  It is\nthe nature of these goods to be cruel to their rivals.  Nothing shall\navail when weighed in the balance against them.  They call out all the\nmercilessness in our disposition, and do not easily forgive us if we\nare so soft-hearted as to shrink from sacrifice in their behalf.\nThe deepest difference, practically, in the moral life of man is the\ndifference between the easy-going and the strenuous mood.  When in the\neasy-going mood the shrinking from present ill is our ruling\nconsideration.  The strenuous mood, on the contrary, makes us quite\nindifferent to present ill, if only the greater ideal be attained.  The\ncapacity for the strenuous mood probably lies slumbering in every man,\nbut it has more difficulty in some than in others in waking up.  It\nneeds the wilder passions to arouse it, the big fears, loves, and\nindignations; or else the deeply penetrating appeal of some one of the\nhigher fidelities, like justice, truth, or freedom.  Strong relief is a\nnecessity of its vision; and a world where all the mountains are\nbrought down and all the valleys are {212} exalted is no congenial\nplace for its habitation.  This is why in a solitary thinker this mood\nmight slumber on forever without waking.  His various ideals, known to\nhim to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same\ndenominational value: he can play fast or loose with them at will.\nThis too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to\nour moral energy falls short of its maximal stimulating power.  Life,\nto be sure, is even in such a world a genuinely ethical symphony; but\nit is played in the compass of a couple of poor octaves, and the\ninfinite scale of values fails to open up.  Many of us, indeed,--like\nSir James Stephen in those eloquent 'Essays by a Barrister,'--would\nopenly laugh at the very idea of the strenuous mood being awakened in\nus by those claims of remote posterity which constitute the last appeal\nof the religion of humanity.  We do not love these men of the future\nkeenly enough; and we love them perhaps the less the more we hear of\ntheir evolutionized perfection, their high average longevity and\neducation, their freedom from war and crime, their relative immunity\nfrom pain and zymotic disease, and all their other negative\nsuperiorities.  This is all too finite, we say; we see too well the\nvacuum beyond.  It lacks the note of infinitude and mystery, and may\nall be dealt with in the don't-care mood.  No need of agonizing\nourselves or making others agonize for these good creatures just at\npresent.\nWhen, however, we believe that a God is there, and that he is one of\nthe claimants, the infinite perspective opens out.  The scale of the\nsymphony is incalculably prolonged.  The more imperative ideals now\nbegin to speak with an altogether new objectivity and significance, and\nto utter the penetrating, shattering, {213} tragically challenging note\nof appeal.  They ring out like the call of Victor Hugo's alpine eagle,\n\"qui parle au pr\u00e9cipice et que le gouffre entend,\" and the strenuous\nmood awakens at the sound.  It saith among the trumpets, ha, ha! it\nsmelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains and the\nshouting.  Its blood is up; and cruelty to the lesser claims, so far\nfrom being a deterrent element, does but add to the stern joy with\nwhich it leaps to answer to the greater.  All through history, in the\nperiodical conflicts of puritanism with the don't-care temper, we see\nthe antagonism of the strenuous and genial moods, and the contrast\nbetween the ethics of infinite and mysterious obligation from on high,\nand those of prudence and the satisfaction of merely finite need.\nThe capacity of the strenuous mood lies so deep down among our natural\nhuman possibilities that even if there were no metaphysical or\ntraditional grounds for believing in a God, men would postulate one\nsimply as a pretext for living hard, and getting out of the game of\nexistence its keenest possibilities of zest.  Our attitude towards\nconcrete evils is entirely different in a world where we believe there\nare none but finite demanders, from what it is in one where we joyously\nface tragedy for an infinite demander's sake.  Every sort of energy and\nendurance, of courage and capacity for handling life's evils, is set\nfree in those who have religious faith.  For this reason the strenuous\ntype of character will on the battle-field of human history always\noutwear the easy-going type, and religion will drive irreligion to the\nwall.\nIt would seem, too,--and this is my final conclusion,--that the stable\nand systematic moral universe {214} for which the ethical philosopher\nasks is fully possible only in a world where there is a divine thinker\nwith all-enveloping demands.  If such a thinker existed, his way of\nsubordinating the demands to one another would be the finally valid\ncasuistic scale; his claims would be the most appealing; his ideal\nuniverse would be the most inclusive realizable whole.  If he now\nexist, then actualized in his thought already must be that ethical\nphilosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore\napproach.[3]  In the interests of our own ideal of systematically\nunified moral truth, therefore, we, as would-be philosophers, must\npostulate a divine thinker, and pray for the victory of the religious\ncause.  Meanwhile, exactly what the thought of the infinite thinker may\nbe is hidden from us even were we sure of his existence; so that our\npostulation of him after all serves only to let loose in us the\nstrenuous mood.  But this is what it does in all men, even those who\nhave no interest in philosophy.  The ethical philosopher, therefore,\nwhenever he ventures to say which course of action is the best, is on\nno essentially different level from the common man.  \"See, I have set\nbefore thee this day life and good, and death and evil; therefore,\nchoose life that thou and thy seed may live,\"--when this challenge\ncomes to us, it is simply our total character and personal genius that\nare on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy, our choice and\nuse of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or\nincapacity for moral life.  From this unsparing practical ordeal no\nprofessor's lectures and no array of books {215} can save us.  The\nsolving word, for the learned and the unlearned man alike, lies in the\nlast resort in the dumb willingnesses and unwillingnesses of their\ninterior characters, and nowhere else.  It is not in heaven, neither is\nit beyond the sea; but the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth\nand in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.\n[1] An Address to the Yale Philosophical Club, published in the\nInternational Journal of Ethics, April, 1891.\n[2] The Principles of Psychology, New York, H. Holt & Co, 1890.\n[3] All this is set forth with great freshness and force in the work of\nmy colleague, Professor Josiah Royce: \"The Religious Aspect of\nPhilosophy.\"  Boston, 1885.\n{216}\nGREAT MEN AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT.[1]\nA remarkable parallel, which I think has never been noticed, obtains\nbetween the facts of social evolution on the one hand, and of\nzo\u00f6logical evolution as expounded by Mr. Darwin on the other.\nIt will be best to prepare the ground for my thesis by a few very\ngeneral remarks on the method of getting at scientific truth.  It is a\ncommon platitude that a complete acquaintance with any one thing,\nhowever small, would require a knowledge of the entire universe.  Not a\nsparrow falls to the ground but some of the remote conditions of his\nfall are to be found in the milky way, in our federal constitution, or\nin the early history of Europe.  That is to say, alter the milky way,\nalter the federal constitution, alter the facts of our barbarian\nancestry, and the universe would so far be a different universe from\nwhat it now is.  One fact involved in the difference might be that the\nparticular little street-boy who threw the stone which brought down the\nsparrow might not find himself opposite the sparrow at that particular\nmoment; or, finding himself there, he might not be in that particular\nserene and disengaged mood of mind which expressed itself in throwing\nthe stone.  But, true as all this is, it would be very foolish for any\none who {217} was inquiring the cause of the sparrow's fall to overlook\nthe boy as too personal, proximate, and so to speak anthropomorphic an\nagent, and to say that the true cause is the federal constitution, the\nwestward migration of the Celtic race, or the structure of the milky\nway.  If we proceeded on that method, we might say with perfect\nlegitimacy that a friend of ours, who had slipped on the ice upon his\ndoor-step and cracked his skull, some months after dining with thirteen\nat the table, died because of that ominous feast.  I know, in fact, one\nsuch instance; and I might, if I chose, contend with perfect logical\npropriety that the slip on the ice was no real accident.  \"There are no\naccidents,\" I might say, \"for science.  The whole history of the world\nconverged to produce that slip.  If anything had been left out, the\nslip would not have occurred just there and then.  To say it would is\nto deny the relations of cause and effect throughout the universe.  The\nreal cause of the death was not the slip, _but the conditions which\nengendered the slip_,--and among them his having sat at a table, six\nmonths previous, one among thirteen.  _That_ is truly the reason why he\ndied within the year.\"\nIt will soon be seen whose arguments I am, in form, reproducing here.\nI would fain lay down the truth without polemics or recrimination.  But\nunfortunately we never fully grasp the import of any true statement\nuntil we have a clear notion of what the opposite untrue statement\nwould be.  The error is needed to set off the truth, much as a dark\nbackground is required for exhibiting the brightness of a picture.  And\nthe error which I am going to use as a foil to set off what seems to me\nthe truth of my own statements is contained in the philosophy of Mr.\nHerbert Spencer and {218} his disciples.  Our problem is, What are the\ncauses that make communities change from generation to\ngeneration,--that make the England of Queen Anne so different from the\nEngland of Elizabeth, the Harvard College of to-day so different from\nthat of thirty years ago?\nI shall reply to this problem, The difference is due to the accumulated\ninfluences of individuals, of their examples, their initiatives, and\ntheir decisions.  The Spencerian school replies, The changes are\nirrespective of persons, and independent of individual control.  They\nare due to the environment, to the circumstances, the physical\ngeography, the ancestral conditions, the increasing experience of outer\nrelations; to everything, in fact, except the Grants and the Bismarcks,\nthe Joneses and the Smiths.\nNow, I say that these theorizers are guilty of precisely the same\nfallacy as he who should ascribe the death of his friend to the dinner\nwith thirteen, or the fall of the sparrow to the milky way.  Like the\ndog in the fable, who drops his real bone to snatch at its image, they\ndrop the real causes to snatch at others, which from no possible human\npoint of view are available or attainable.  Their fallacy is a\npractical one.  Let us see where it lies.  Although I believe in\nfree-will myself, I will waive that belief in this discussion, and\nassume with the Spencerians the predestination of all human actions.\nOn that assumption I gladly allow that were the intelligence\ninvestigating the man's or the sparrow's death omniscient and\nomnipresent, able to take in the whole of time and space at a single\nglance, there would not be the slightest objection to the milky way or\nthe fatal feast being {219} invoked among the sought-for causes.  Such\na divine intelligence would see instantaneously all the infinite lines\nof convergence towards a given result, and it would, moreover, see\nimpartially: it would see the fatal feast to be as much a condition of\nthe sparrow's death as of the man's; it would see the boy with the\nstone to be as much a condition of the man's fall as of the sparrow's.\nThe human mind, however, is constituted on an entirely different plan.\nIt has no such power of universal intuition.  Its finiteness obliges it\nto see but two or three things at a time.  If it wishes to take wider\nsweeps it has to use 'general ideas,' as they are called, and in so\ndoing to drop all concrete truths.  Thus, in the present case, if we as\nmen wish to feel the connection between the milky way and the boy and\nthe dinner and the sparrow and the man's death, we can do so only by\nfalling back on the enormous emptiness of what is called an abstract\nproposition.  We must say, All things in the world are fatally\npredetermined, and hang together in the adamantine fixity of a system\nof natural law.  But in the vagueness of this vast proposition we have\nlost all the concrete facts and links; and in all practical matters the\nconcrete links are the only things of importance.  The human mind is\nessentially partial.  It can be efficient at all only by _picking out_\nwhat to attend to, and ignoring everything else,--by narrowing its\npoint of view.  Otherwise, what little strength it has is dispersed,\nand it loses its way altogether.  Man always wants his curiosity\ngratified for a particular purpose.  If, in the case of the sparrow,\nthe purpose is punishment, it would be idiotic to wander off from the\ncats, boys, and other possible agencies close by in the street, to\n{220} survey the early Celts and the milky way: the boy would meanwhile\nescape.  And if, in the case of the unfortunate man, we lose ourselves\nin contemplation of the thirteen-at-table mystery, and fail to notice\nthe ice on the step and cover it with ashes, some other poor fellow,\nwho never dined out in his life, may slip on it in coming to the door,\nand fall and break his head too.\nIt is, then, a necessity laid upon us as human beings to limit our\nview.  In mathematics we know how this method of ignoring and\nneglecting quantities lying outside of a certain range has been adopted\nin the differential calculus.  The calculator throws out all the\n'infinitesimals' of the quantities he is considering.  He treats them\n(under certain rules) as if they did not exist.  In themselves they\nexist perfectly all the while; but they are as if they did not exist\nfor the purposes of his calculation.  Just so an astronomer, in dealing\nwith the tidal movements of the ocean, takes no account of the waves\nmade by the wind, or by the pressure of all the steamers which day and\nnight are moving their thousands of tons upon its surface.  Just so the\nmarksman, in sighting his rifle, allows for the motion of the wind, but\nnot for the equally real motion of the earth and solar system.  Just so\na business man's punctuality may overlook an error of five minutes,\nwhile a physicist, measuring the velocity of light, must count each\nthousandth of a second.\nThere are, in short, _different cycles of operation_ in nature;\ndifferent departments, so to speak, relatively independent of one\nanother, so that what goes on at any moment in one may be compatible\nwith almost any condition of things at the same time in the next.  The\nmould on the biscuit in the store-room of a {221} man-of-war vegetates\nin absolute indifference to the nationality of the flag, the direction\nof the voyage, the weather, and the human dramas that may go on on\nboard; and a mycologist may study it in complete abstraction from all\nthese larger details.  Only by so studying it, in fact, is there any\nchance of the mental concentration by which alone he may hope to learn\nsomething of its nature.  On the other hand, the captain who in\nmanoeuvring the vessel through a naval fight should think it necessary\nto bring the mouldy biscuit into his calculations would very likely\nlose the battle by reason of the excessive 'thoroughness' of his mind.\nThe causes which operate in these incommensurable cycles are connected\nwith one another only _if we take the whole universe into account_.\nFor all lesser points of view it is lawful--nay, more, it is for human\nwisdom necessary--to regard them as disconnected and irrelevant to one\nanother.\nAnd this brings us nearer to our special topic.  If we look at an\nanimal or a human being, distinguished from the rest of his kind by the\npossession of some extraordinary peculiarity, good or bad, we shall be\nable to discriminate between the causes which originally _produced_ the\npeculiarity in him and the causes that _maintain_ it after it is\nproduced; and we shall see, if the peculiarity be one that he was born\nwith, that these two sets of causes belong to two such irrelevant\ncycles.  It was the triumphant originality of Darwin to see this, and\nto act accordingly.  Separating the causes of production under the\ntitle of 'tendencies to spontaneous variation,' and relegating them to\na physiological cycle which he forthwith {222} agreed to ignore\naltogether,[2] he confined his attention to the causes of preservation,\nand under the names of natural selection and sexual selection studied\nthem exclusively as functions of the cycle of the environment.\nPre-Darwinian philosophers had also tried to establish the doctrine of\ndescent with modification; but they all committed the blunder of\nclumping the two cycles of causation into one.  What preserves an\nanimal with his peculiarity, if it be a useful one, they saw to be the\nnature of the environment to which the peculiarity was adjusted.  The\ngiraffe with his peculiar neck is preserved by the fact that there are\nin his environment tall trees whose leaves he can digest.  But these\nphilosophers went further, and said that the presence of the trees not\nonly maintained an animal with a long neck to browse upon their\nbranches, but also produced him.  They _made_ his neck long by the\nconstant striving they aroused in him to reach up to them.  The\nenvironment, in short, was supposed by these writers to mould the\nanimal by a kind of direct pressure, very much as a seal presses the\nwax into harmony with itself.  Numerous instances were given of the way\nin which this goes on under our eyes.  The exercise of the forge makes\nthe right arm strong, the palm grows callous to the oar, the mountain\nair distends the chest, the chased fox grows cunning and the chased\nbird shy, the arctic cold stimulates the animal combustion, and so\nforth.  Now these changes, of which many more examples might be\nadduced, are {223} at present distinguished by the special name of\n_adaptive_ changes.  Their peculiarity is that that very feature in the\nenvironment to which the animal's nature grows adjusted, itself\nproduces the adjustment.  The 'inner relation,' to use Mr. Spencer's\nphrase, 'corresponds' with its own efficient cause.\nDarwin's first achievement was to show the utter insignificance in\namount of these changes produced by direct adaptation, the immensely\ngreater mass of changes being produced by internal molecular accidents,\nof which we know nothing.  His next achievement was to define the true\nproblem with which we have to deal when we study the effects of the\nvisible environment on the animal.  That problem is simply this; Is the\nenvironment more likely to _preserve or to destroy him_, on account of\nthis or that peculiarity with which he may be born?  In giving the name\nof 'accidental variations' to those peculiarities with which an animal\nis born, Darwin does not for a moment mean to suggest that they are not\nthe fixed outcome of natural law.  If the total system of the universe\nbe taken into account, the causes of these variations and the visible\nenvironment which preserves or destroys them, undoubtedly do, in some\nremote and roundabout way, hang together.  What Darwin means is, that,\nsince that environment is a perfectly known thing, and its relations to\nthe organism in the way of destruction or preservation are tangible and\ndistinct, it would utterly confuse our finite understandings and\nfrustrate our hopes of science to mix in with it facts from such a\ndisparate and incommensurable cycle as that in which the variations are\nproduced.  This last cycle is that of occurrences before the animal is\nborn.  It is the cycle of influences upon ova and embryos; {224} in\nwhich lie the causes that tip them and tilt them towards masculinity or\nfemininity, towards strength or weakness, towards health or disease,\nand towards divergence from the parent type.  What are the causes there?\nIn the first place, they are molecular and invisible,--inaccessible,\ntherefore, to direct observation of any kind.  Secondly, their\noperations are compatible with any social, political, and physical\nconditions of environment.  The same parents, living in the same\nenvironing conditions, may at one birth produce a genius, at the next\nan idiot or a monster.  The visible external conditions are therefore\nnot direct determinants of this cycle; and the more we consider the\nmatter, the more we are forced to believe that two children of the same\nparents are made to differ from each other by causes as\ndisproportionate to their ultimate effects as is the famous pebble on\nthe Rocky Mountain crest, which separates two rain-drops, to the Gulf\nof St. Lawrence and the Pacific Ocean toward which it makes them\nseverally flow.\nThe great mechanical distinction between transitive forces and\ndischarging forces is nowhere illustrated on such a scale as in\nphysiology.  Almost all causes there are forces of _detent_, which\noperate by simply unlocking energy already stored up.  They are\nupsetters of unstable equilibria, and the resultant effect depends\ninfinitely more on the nature of the materials upset than on that of\nthe particular stimulus which joggles them down.  Galvanic work, equal\nto unity, done on a frog's nerve will discharge from the muscle to\nwhich the nerve belongs mechanical work equal to seventy thousand; and\nexactly the same muscular {225} effect will emerge if other irritants\nthan galvanism are employed.  The irritant has merely started or\nprovoked something which then went on of itself,--as a match may start\na fire which consumes a whole town.  And qualitatively as well as\nquantitatively the effect may be absolutely incommensurable with the\ncause.  We find this condition of things in ail organic matter.\nChemists are distracted by the difficulties which the instability of\nalbuminoid compounds opposes to their study.  Two specimens, treated in\nwhat outwardly seem scrupulously identical conditions, behave in quite\ndifferent ways.  You know about the invisible factors of fermentation,\nand how the fate of a jar of milk--whether it turn into a sour clot or\na mass of koumiss--depends on whether the lactic acid ferment or the\nalcoholic is introduced first, and gets ahead of the other in starting\nthe process.  Now, when the result is the tendency of an ovum, itself\ninvisible to the naked eye, to tip towards this direction or that in\nits further evolution,--to bring forth a genius or a dunce, even as the\nrain-drop passes east or west of the pebble,--is it not obvious that\nthe deflecting cause must lie in a region so recondite and minute, must\nbe such a ferment of a ferment, an infinitesimal of so high an order,\nthat surmise itself may never succeed even in attempting to frame an\nimage of it?\nSuch being the case, was not Darwin right to turn his back upon that\nregion altogether, and to keep his own problem carefully free from all\nentanglement with matters such as these?  The success of his work is a\nsufficiently affirmative reply.\nAnd this brings us at last to the heart of our subject.  The causes of\nproduction of great men lie in a {226} sphere wholly inaccessible to\nthe social philosopher.  He must simply accept geniuses as data, just\nas Darwin accepts his spontaneous variations.  For him, as for Darwin,\nthe only problem is, these data being given, How does the environment\naffect them, and how do they affect the environment?  Now, I affirm\nthat the relation of the visible environment to the great man is in the\nmain exactly what it is to the 'variation' in the Darwinian philosophy.\nIt chiefly adopts or rejects, preserves or destroys, in short _selects_\nhim.[3]  And whenever it adopts and preserves the great man, it becomes\nmodified by his influence in an entirely original and peculiar way.  He\nacts as a ferment, and changes its constitution, just as the advent of\na new zo\u00f6logical species changes the faunal and floral equilibrium of\nthe region in which it appears.  We all recollect Mr. Darwin's famous\nstatement of the influence of cats on the growth of clover in their\nneighborhood.  We all have read of the effects of the European rabbit\nin New Zealand, and we have many of us taken part in the controversy\nabout the English sparrow here,--whether he kills most canker-worms, or\ndrives away most native birds.  Just so the great man, whether he be an\nimportation from without like Clive in India or Agassiz here, or\nwhether he spring from the soil like Mahomet or Franklin, brings about\na rearrangement, on a large or a small scale, of the pre-existing\nsocial relations.\n{227}\nThe mutations of societies, then, from generation to generation, are in\nthe main due directly or indirectly to the acts or the example of\nindividuals whose genius was so adapted to the receptivities of the\nmoment, or whose accidental position of authority was so critical that\nthey became ferments, initiators of movement, setters of precedent or\nfashion, centres of corruption, or destroyers of other persons, whose\ngifts, had they had free play, would have led society in another\ndirection.\nWe see this power of individual initiative exemplified on a small scale\nall about us, and on a large scale in the case of the leaders of\nhistory.  It is only following the common-sense method of a Lyell, a\nDarwin, and a Whitney to interpret the unknown by the known, and reckon\nup cumulatively the only causes of social change we can directly\nobserve.  Societies of men are just like individuals, in that both at\nany given moment offer ambiguous potentialities of development.\nWhether a young man enters business or the ministry may depend on a\ndecision which has to be made before a certain day.  He takes the place\noffered in the counting-house, and is _committed_.  Little by little,\nthe habits, the knowledges, of the other career, which once lay so\nnear, cease to be reckoned even among his possibilities.  At first, he\nmay sometimes doubt whether the self he murdered in that decisive hour\nmight not have been the better of the two; but with the years such\nquestions themselves expire, and the old alternative _ego_, once so\nvivid, fades into something less substantial than a dream.  It is no\notherwise with nations.  They may be committed by kings and ministers\nto peace or war, by generals to victory or defeat, by prophets to this\n{228} religion or to that, by various geniuses to fame in art, science,\nor industry.  A war is a true point of bifurcation of future\npossibilities.  Whether it fail or succeed, its declaration must be the\nstarting-point of new policies.  Just so does a revolution, or any\ngreat civic precedent, become a deflecting influence, whose operations\nwiden with the course of time.  Communities obey their ideals; and an\naccidental success fixes an ideal, as an accidental failure blights it.\nWould England have to-day the 'imperial' ideal which she now has, if a\ncertain boy named Bob Clive had shot himself, as he tried to do, at\nMadras?  Would she be the drifting raft she is now in European\naffairs[4] if a Frederic the Great had inherited her throne instead of\na Victoria, and if Messrs. Bentham, Mill, Cobden, and Bright had all\nbeen born in Prussia?  England has, no doubt, to-day precisely the same\nintrinsic value relatively to the other nations that she ever had.\nThere is no such fine accumulation of human material upon the globe.\nBut in England the material has lost effective form, while in Germany\nit has found it.  Leaders give the form.  Would England be crying\nforward and backward at once, as she does now, 'letting I will not wait\nupon I would,' wishing to conquer but not to fight, if her ideal had in\nall these years been fixed by a succession of statesmen of supremely\ncommanding personality, working in one direction?  Certainly not.  She\nwould have espoused, for better or worse, either one course or another.\nHad Bismarck died in his cradle, the Germans would still be satisfied\nwith appearing to themselves as a race of spectacled _Gelehrten_ and\npolitical herbivora, and to the French as _ces bons_, or _ces naifs_,\n{229} _Allemands_.  Bismarck's will showed them, to their own great\nastonishment, that they could play a far livelier game.  The lesson\nwill not be forgotten.  Germany may have many vicissitudes, but they--\n\"will never do away, I ween,\nThe marks of that which once hath been\"--\nof Bismarck's initiative, namely, from 1860 to 1873.\nThe fermentative influence of geniuses must be admitted as, at any\nrate, one factor in the changes that constitute social evolution.  The\ncommunity _may_ evolve in many ways.  The accidental presence of this\nor that ferment decides in which way it _shall_ evolve.  Why, the very\nbirds of the forest, the parrot, the mino, have the power of human\nspeech, but never develop it of themselves; some one must be there to\nteach them.  So with us individuals.  Rembrandt must teach us to enjoy\nthe struggle of light with darkness, Wagner to enjoy peculiar musical\neffects; Dickens gives a twist to our sentimentality, Artemus Ward to\nour humor; Emerson kindles a new moral light within us.  But it is like\nColumbus's egg.  \"All can raise the flowers now, for all have got the\nseed.\"  But if this be true of the individuals in the community, how\ncan it be false of the community as a whole?  If shown a certain way, a\ncommunity may take it; if not, it will never find it.  And the ways are\nto a large extent indeterminate in advance.  A nation may obey either\nof many alternative impulses given by different men of genius, and\nstill live and be prosperous, just as a man may enter either of many\nbusinesses.  Only, the prosperities may differ in their type.\nBut the indeterminism is not absolute.  Not every {230} 'man' fits\nevery 'hour.'  Some incompatibilities there are.  A given genius may\ncome either too early or too late.  Peter the Hermit would now be sent\nto a lunatic asylum.  John Mill in the tenth century would have lived\nand died unknown.  Cromwell and Napoleon need their revolutions, Grant\nhis civil war.  An Ajax gets no fame in the day of telescopic-sighted\nrifles; and, to express differently an instance which Spencer uses,\nwhat could a Watt have effected in a tribe which no precursive genius\nhad taught to smelt iron or to turn a lathe?\nNow, the important thing to notice is that what makes a certain genius\nnow incompatible with his surroundings is usually the fact that some\nprevious genius of a different strain has warped the community away\nfrom the sphere of his possible effectiveness.  After Voltaire, no\nPeter the Hermit; after Charles IX. and Louis XIV., no general\nprotestantization of France; after a Manchester school, a\nBeaconsfield's success is transient; after a Philip II., a Castelar\nmakes little headway; and so on.  Each bifurcation cuts off certain\nsides of the field altogether, and limits the future possible angles of\ndeflection.  A community is a living thing, and in words which I can do\nno better than quote from Professor Clifford,[5] \"it is the peculiarity\nof living things not merely that they change under the influence of\nsurrounding circumstances, but that any change which takes place in\nthem is not lost but retained, and as it were built into the organism\nto serve as the foundation for future actions.  If you cause any\ndistortion in the growth of a tree and make it crooked, whatever you\nmay do afterwards to make the tree straight the mark of your {231}\ndistortion is there; it is absolutely indelible; it has become part of\nthe tree's nature....  Suppose, however, that you take a lump of gold,\nmelt it, and let it cool....  No one can tell by examining a piece of\ngold how often it has been melted and cooled in geologic ages, or even\nin the last year by the hand of man.  Any one who cuts down an oak can\ntell by the rings in its trunk how many times winter has frozen it into\nwidowhood, and how many times summer has warmed it into life.  A living\nbeing must always contain within itself the history, not merely of its\nown existence, but of all its ancestors.\"\nEvery painter can tell us how each added line deflects his picture in a\ncertain sense.  Whatever lines follow must be built on those first laid\ndown.  Every author who starts to rewrite a piece of work knows how\nimpossible it becomes to use any of the first-written pages again.  The\nnew beginning has already excluded the possibility of those earlier\nphrases and transitions, while it has at the same time created the\npossibility of an indefinite set of new ones, no one of which, however,\nis completely determined in advance.  Just so the social surroundings\nof the past and present hour exclude the possibility of accepting\ncertain contributions from individuals; but they do not positively\ndefine what contributions shall be accepted, for in themselves they are\npowerless to fix what the nature of the individual offerings shall\nbe.[6]\n{232}\nThus social evolution is a resultant of the interaction of two wholly\ndistinct factors,--the individual, deriving his peculiar gifts from the\nplay of physiological and infra-social forces, but bearing all the\npower of initiative and origination in his hands; and, second, the\nsocial environment, with its power of adopting or rejecting both him\nand his gifts.  Both factors are essential to change.  The community\nstagnates without the impulse of the individual.  The impulse dies away\nwithout the sympathy of the community.\nAll this seems nothing more than common-sense.  All who wish to see it\ndeveloped by a man of genius should read that golden little work,\nBagehot's Physics and Politics, in which (it seems to me) the complete\nsense of the way in which concrete things grow and change is as\nlivingly present as the straining after a pseudo-philosophy of\nevolution is livingly absent.  But there are never wanting minds to\nwhom such views seem personal and contracted, and allied to an\nanthropomorphism long exploded in other fields of knowledge.  \"The\nindividual withers, and the world is more and more,\" to these writers;\nand in a Buckle, a Draper, and a Taine we all know how much the 'world'\nhas come to be almost synonymous with the _climate_.  We all know, too,\nhow the controversy has been kept up between the partisans of a\n'science of history' and those who deny the existence of anything like\nnecessary 'laws' where human societies are concerned.  Mr. Spencer, at\nthe opening of his Study of Sociology, makes an onslaught on the\n'great-man theory' of history, from which a few passages may be\nquoted:--\n\"The genesis of societies by the action of great men may be comfortably\nbelieved so long as, resting in general {233} notions, you do not ask\nfor particulars.  But now, if, dissatisfied with vagueness, we demand\nthat our ideas shall be brought into focus and exactly defined, we\ndiscover the hypothesis to be utterly incoherent.  If, not stopping at\nthe explanation of social progress as due to the great man, we go back\na step, and ask, Whence comes the great man? we find that the theory\nbreaks down completely.  The question has two conceivable answers: his\norigin is supernatural, or it is natural.  Is his origin supernatural?\nThen he is a deputy god, and we have theocracy once removed,--or,\nrather, not removed at all....  Is this an unacceptable solution?  Then\nthe origin of the great man is natural; and immediately this is\nrecognized, he must be classed with all other phenomena in the society\nthat gave him birth as a product of its antecedents.  Along with the\nwhole generation of which he forms a minute part, along with its\ninstitutions, language, knowledge, manners, and its multitudinous arts\nand appliances, he is a _resultant_....  You must admit that the\ngenesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex\ninfluences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the\nsocial state into which that race has slowly grown....  Before he can\nremake his society, his society must make him.  All those changes of\nwhich he is the proximate initiator have their chief causes in the\ngenerations he descended from.  If there is to be anything like a real\nexplanation of those changes, it must be sought in that aggregate of\nconditions out of which both he and they have arisen.\"[7]\nNow, it seems to me that there is something which one might almost call\nimpudent in the attempt which Mr. Spencer makes, in the first sentence\nof this extract, to pin the reproach of vagueness upon those who\nbelieve in the power of initiative of the great man.\n{234}\nSuppose I say that the singular moderation which now distinguishes\nsocial, political, and religious discussion in England, and contrasts\nso strongly with the bigotry and dogmatism of sixty years ago, is\nlargely due to J. S. Mill's example.  I may possibly be wrong about the\nfacts; but I am, at any rate, 'asking for particulars,' and not\n'resting in general notions.'  And if Mr. Spencer should tell me it\nstarted from no personal influence whatever, but from the 'aggregate of\nconditions,' the 'generations,' Mill and all his contemporaries\n'descended from,' the whole past order of nature in short, surely he,\nnot I, would be the person 'satisfied with vagueness.'\nThe fact is that Mr. Spencer's sociological method is identical with\nthat of one who would invoke the zodiac to account for the fall of the\nsparrow, and the thirteen at table to explain the gentleman's death.\nIt is of little more scientific value than the Oriental method of\nreplying to whatever question arises by the unimpeachable truism, \"God\nis great.\"  _Not_ to fall back on the gods, where a proximate principle\nmay be found, has with us Westerners long since become the sign of an\nefficient as distinguished from an inefficient intellect.\nTo believe that the cause of everything is to be found in its\nantecedents is the starting-point, the initial postulate, not the goal\nand consummation, of science.  If she is simply to lead us out of the\nlabyrinth by the same hole we went in by three or four thousand years\nago, it seems hardly worth while to have followed her through the\ndarkness at all.  If anything is humanly certain it is that the great\nman's society, properly so called, does not make him before he can\nremake it.  Physiological forces, with which {235} the social,\npolitical, geographical, and to a great extent anthropological\nconditions have just as much and just as little to do as the condition\nof the crater of Vesuvius has to do with the flickering of this gas by\nwhich I write, are what make him.  Can it be that Mr. Spencer holds the\nconvergence of sociological pressures to have so impinged on\nStratford-upon-Avon about the 26th of April, 1564, that a W.\nShakespeare, with all his mental peculiarities, had to be born\nthere,--as the pressure of water outside a certain boat will cause a\nstream of a certain form to ooze into a particular leak?  And does he\nmean to say that if the aforesaid W. Shakespeare had died of cholera\ninfantum, another mother at Stratford-upon-Avon would needs have\nengendered a duplicate copy of him, to restore the sociologic\nequilibrium,--just as the same stream of water will reappear, no matter\nhow often you pass a sponge over the leak, so long as the outside level\nremains unchanged?  Or might the substitute arise at\n'Stratford-atte-Bowe'?  Here, as elsewhere, it is very hard, in the\nmidst of Mr. Spencer's vagueness, to tell what he does mean at all.\nWe have, however, in his disciple, Mr. Grant Allen, one who leaves us\nin no doubt whatever of his precise meaning.  This widely informed,\nsuggestive, and brilliant writer published last year a couple of\narticles in the Gentleman's Magazine, in which he maintained that\nindividuals have no initiative in determining social change.\n\"The differences between one nation and another, whether in intellect,\ncommerce, art, morals, or general temperament, ultimately depend, not\nupon any mysterious properties of race, nationality, or any other\nunknown and unintelligible abstractions, but simply and solely upon the\n{236} physical circumstances to which they are exposed.  If it be a\nfact, as we know it to be, that the French nation differs recognizably\nfrom the Chinese, and the people of Hamburg differ recognizably from\nthe people of Timbuctoo, then the notorious and conspicuous differences\nbetween them are wholly due to the geographical position of the various\nraces.  If the people who went to Hamburg had gone to Timbuctoo, they\nwould now be indistinguishable from the semi-barbarian negroes who\ninhabit that central African metropolis;[8] and if the people who went\nto Timbuctoo had gone to Hamburg, they would now have been\nwhite-skinned merchants driving a roaring trade in imitation sherry and\nindigestible port....  The differentiating agency must be sought in the\ngreat permanent geographical features of land and sea; ... these have\nnecessarily and inevitably moulded the characters and histories of\nevery nation upon the earth....  We cannot regard any nation as an\nactive agent in differentiating itself.  Only the surrounding\ncircumstances can have any effect in such a direction.  [These two\nsentences dogmatically deny the existence of the relatively independent\nphysiological cycle of causation.]  To suppose otherwise is to suppose\nthat the mind of man is exempt from the universal law of causation.\nThere is no caprice, no spontaneous impulse, in human endeavors.  Even\ntastes and inclinations _must_ themselves be the result of surrounding\ncauses.\"[9]\n{237}\nElsewhere Mr. Allen, writing of the Greek culture, says:--\n\"It was absolutely and unreservedly the product of the geographical\nHellas, acting upon the given factor of the undifferentiated Aryan\nbrain,...  To me it seems a self-evident proposition that nothing\nwhatsoever can differentiate one body of men from another, except the\nphysical conditions in which they are set,--including, of course, under\nthe term _physical conditions_ the relations of place and time in which\nthey stand with regard to other bodies of men.  To suppose otherwise is\nto deny the primordial law of causation.  To imagine that the mind can\ndifferentiate itself is to imagine that it can be differentiated\nwithout a cause.\"[10]\nThis outcry about the law of universal causation being undone, the\nmoment we refuse to invest in the kind of causation which is peddled\nround by a particular school, makes one impatient.  These writers have\nno imagination of alternatives.  With them there is no _tertium quid_\nbetween outward environment and miracle.  _Aut Caesar, aut nullus_!\n_Aut_ Spencerism, _aut_ catechism!\nIf by 'physical conditions' Mr. Allen means what he does mean, the\noutward cycle of visible nature and man, his assertion is simply\nphysiologically false.  For a national mind differentiates 'itself'\nwhenever a genius is born in its midst by causes acting in the\ninvisible and molecular cycle.  But if Mr. Allen means by 'physical\nconditions' the whole of nature, his assertion, though true, forms but\nthe vague Asiatic {238} profession of belief in an all-enveloping fate,\nwhich certainly need not plume itself on any specially advanced or\nscientific character.\nAnd how can a thinker so clever as Mr. Allen fail to have distinguished\nin these matters between _necessary_ conditions and _sufficient_\nconditions of a given result?  The French say that to have an omelet we\nmust break our eggs; that is, the breaking of eggs is a necessary\ncondition of the omelet.  But is it a sufficient condition?  Does an\nomelet appear whenever three eggs are broken?  So of the Greek mind.\nTo get such versatile intelligence it may be that such commercial\ndealings with the world as the geographical Hellas afforded are a\nnecessary condition.  But if they are a sufficient condition, why did\nnot the Phoenicians outstrip the Greeks in intelligence?  No\ngeographical environment can produce a given type of mind.  It can only\nfoster and further certain types fortuitously produced, and thwart and\nfrustrate others.  Once again, its function is simply selective, and\ndetermines what shall actually be only by destroying what is positively\nincompatible.  An Arctic environment is incompatible with improvident\nhabits in its denizens; but whether the inhabitants of such a region\nshall unite with their thrift the peacefulness of the Eskimo or the\npugnacity of the Norseman is, so far as the climate is concerned, an\naccident.  Evolutionists should not forget that we all have five\nfingers not because four or six would not do just as well, but merely\nbecause the first vertebrate above the fishes _happened_ to have that\nnumber.  He owed his prodigious success in founding a line of descent\nto some entirely other quality,--we know {239} not which,--but the\ninessential five fingers were taken in tow and preserved to the present\nday.  So of most social peculiarities.  Which of them shall be taken in\ntow by the few qualities which the environment necessarily exacts is a\nmatter of what physiological accidents shall happen among individuals.\nMr. Allen promises to prove his thesis in detail by the examples of\nChina, India, England, Rome, etc.  I have not the smallest hesitation\nin predicting that he will do no more with these examples than he has\ndone with Hellas.  He will appear upon the scene after the fact, and\nshow that the quality developed by each race was, naturally enough, not\nincompatible with its habitat.  But he will utterly fail to show that\nthe particular form of compatibility fallen into in each case was the\none necessary and only possible form.\nNaturalists know well enough how indeterminate the harmonies between a\nfauna and its environment are.  An animal may better his chances of\nexistence in either of many ways,--growing aquatic, arboreal, or\nsubterranean; small and swift, or massive and bulky; spiny, horny,\nslimy, or venomous; more timid or more pugnacious; more cunning or more\nfertile of offspring; more gregarious or more solitary; or in other\nways besides,--and any one of these ways may suit him to many widely\ndifferent environments.\nReaders of Mr. A. R. Wallace will well remember the striking\nillustrations of this in his Malay Archipelago:--\n\"Borneo closely resembles New Guinea not only in its vast size and its\nfreedom from volcanoes, but in its variety of geological structure, its\nuniformity of climate, and the general aspect of the forest vegetation\nthat clothes its surface; the Moluccas are the counterpart of the\nPhilippines {240} in their volcanic structure, their extreme fertility,\ntheir luxuriant forests, and their frequent earthquakes; and Bali, with\nthe east end of Java, has a climate almost as dry and a soil almost as\narid as that of Timor.  Yet between these corresponding groups of\nislands, constructed, as it were, after the same pattern, subjected to\nthe same climate, and bathed by the same oceans, there exists the\ngreatest possible contrast when we compare their animal productions.\nNowhere does the ancient doctrine that differences or similarities in\nthe various forms of life that inhabit different countries are due to\ncorresponding physical differences or similarities in the countries\nthemselves, meet with so direct and palpable a contradiction.  Borneo\nand New Guinea, as alike physically as two distinct countries can be,\nare zo\u00f6logically wide as the poles asunder; while Australia, with its\ndry winds, its open plains, its stony deserts, and its temperate\nclimate, yet produces birds and quadrupeds which are closely related to\nthose inhabiting the hot, damp, luxuriant forests which everywhere\nclothe the plains and mountains of New Guinea.\"\nHere we have similar physical-geography environments harmonizing with\nwidely differing animal lives, and similar animal lives harmonizing\nwith widely differing geographical environments.  A singularly\naccomplished writer, E. Gryzanowski, in the North American Review,[11]\nuses the instances of Sardinia and Corsica in support of this thesis\nwith great effect He says:--\n\"These sister islands, lying in the very centre of the Mediterranean,\nat almost equal distances from the centres of Latin and Neo-Latin\ncivilization, within easy reach of the Phoenician, the Greek, and the\nSaracen, with a {241} coast-line of more than a thousand miles, endowed\nwith obvious and tempting advantages, and hiding untold sources of\nagricultural and mineral wealth, have nevertheless remained unknown,\nunheeded, and certainly uncared for during the thirty centuries of\nEuropean history....  These islands have dialects, but no language;\nrecords of battles, but no history.  They have customs, but no laws;\nthe _vendetta_, but no justice.  They have wants and wealth, but no\ncommerce, timber and ports, but no shipping.  They have legends, but no\npoetry, beauty, but no art; and twenty years ago it could still be said\nthat they had universities, but no students....  That Sardinia, with\nall her emotional and picturesque barbarism, has never produced a\nsingle artist is almost as strange as her barbarism itself....  Near\nthe focus of European civilization, in the very spot which an _\u00e0\npriori_ geographer would point out as the most favorable place for\nmaterial and intellectual, commercial, and political development, these\nstrange sister islands have slept their secular sleep, like _nodes_ on\nthe sounding-board of history.\"\nThis writer then goes on to compare Sardinia and Sicily with some\ndetail.  All the material advantages are in favor of Sardinia, \"and the\nSardinian population, being of an ancestry more mixed than that of the\nEnglish race, would justify far higher expectations than that of\nSicily.\"  Yet Sicily's past history has been brilliant in the extreme,\nand her commerce to-day is great.  Dr. Gryzanowski has his own theory\nof the historic torpor of these favored isles.  He thinks they\nstagnated because they never gained political autonomy, being always\nowned by some Continental power.  I will not dispute the theory; but I\nwill ask, Why did they not gain it? and answer immediately: Simply\nbecause no individuals were {242} born there with patriotism and\nability enough to inflame their countrymen with national pride,\nambition, and thirst for independent life.  Corsicans and Sardinians\nare probably as good stuff as any of their neighbors.  But the best\nwood-pile will not blaze till a torch is applied, and the appropriate\ntorches seem to have been wanting.[12]\nSporadic great men come everywhere.  But for a community to get\nvibrating through and through {243} with intensely active life, many\ngeniuses coming together and in rapid succession are required.  This is\nwhy great epochs are so rare,--why the sudden bloom of a Greece, an\nearly Rome, a Renaissance, is such a mystery.  Blow must follow blow so\nfast that no cooling can occur in the intervals.  Then the mass of the\nnation grows incandescent, and may continue to glow by pure inertia\nlong after the originators of its internal movement have passed away.\nWe often hear surprise expressed that in these high tides of human\naffairs not only the people should be filled with stronger life, but\nthat individual geniuses should seem so exceptionally abundant.  This\nmystery is just about as deep as the time-honored conundrum as to why\ngreat rivers flow by great towns.  It is true that great public\nfermentations awaken and adopt many geniuses, who in more torpid times\nwould have had no chance to work.  But over and above this there must\nbe an exceptional concourse of genius about a time, to make the\nfermentation begin at all.  The unlikeliness of the concourse is far\ngreater than the unlikeliness of any particular genius; hence the\nrarity of these periods and the exceptional aspect which they always\nwear.\n{244}\nIt is folly, then, to speak of the 'laws of history' as of something\ninevitable, which science has only to discover, and whose consequences\nany one can then foretell but do nothing to alter or avert.  Why, the\nvery laws of physics are conditional, and deal with _ifs_.  The\nphysicist does not say, \"The water will boil anyhow;\" he only says it\nwill boil if a fire be kindled beneath it.  And so the utmost the\nstudent of sociology can ever predict is that _if_ a genius of a\ncertain sort show the way, society will be sure to follow.  It might\nlong ago have been predicted with great confidence that both Italy and\nGermany would reach a stable unity if some one could but succeed in\nstarting the process.  It could not have been predicted, however, that\nthe _modus operandi_ in each case would be subordination to a paramount\nstate rather than federation, because no historian could have\ncalculated the freaks of birth and fortune which gave at the same\nmoment such positions of authority to three such peculiar individuals\nas Napoleon III., Bismarck, and Cavour.  So of our own politics.  It is\ncertain now that the movement of the independents, reformers, or\nwhatever one please to call them, will triumph.  But whether it do so\nby converting the Republican party to its ends, or by rearing a new\nparty on the ruins of both our present factions, the historian cannot\nsay.  There can be no doubt that the reform movement would make more\nprogress in one year with an adequate personal leader than as now in\nten without one.  Were there a great citizen, splendid with every civic\ngift, to be its candidate, who can doubt that he would lead us to\nvictory?  But, at present, we, his environment, who sigh for him and\nwould so gladly preserve and adopt him if he came, can neither {245}\nmove without him, nor yet do anything to bring him forth.[13]\nTo conclude: The evolutionary view of history, when it denies the vital\nimportance of individual initiative, is, then, an utterly vague and\nunscientific conception, a lapse from modern scientific determinism\ninto the most ancient oriental fatalism.  The lesson of the analysis\nthat we have made (even on the completely deterministic hypothesis with\nwhich we started) forms an appeal of the most stimulating sort to the\nenergy of the individual.  Even the dogged resistance of the\nreactionary conservative to changes which he cannot hope entirely to\ndefeat is justified and shown to be effective.  He retards the\nmovement; deflects it a little by the concessions he extracts; gives it\na resultant momentum, compounded of his inertia and his adversaries'\nspeed; and keeps up, in short, a constant lateral pressure, which, to\nbe sure, never heads it round about, but brings it up at last at a goal\nfar to the right or left of that to which it would have drifted had he\nallowed it to drift alone.\nI now pass to the last division of my subject, the function of the\nenvironment in _mental_ evolution.  After what I have already said, I\nmay be quite concise.  Here, if anywhere, it would seem at first sight\nas if that school must be right which makes the mind passively plastic,\nand the environment actively productive of the form and order of its\nconceptions; which, in a word, thinks that all mental progress must\nresult from {246} a series of adaptive changes, in the sense already\ndefined of that word.  We know what a vast part of our mental furniture\nconsists of purely remembered, not reasoned, experience.  The entire\nfield of our habits and associations by contiguity belongs here.  The\nentire field of those abstract conceptions which were taught us with\nthe language into which we were born belongs here also.  And, more than\nthis, there is reason to think that the order of 'outer relations'\nexperienced by the individual may itself determine the order in which\nthe general characters imbedded therein shall be noticed and extracted\nby his mind.[14]  The pleasures and benefits, moreover, which certain\nparts of the environment yield, and the pains and hurts which other\nparts inflict, determine the direction of our interest and our\nattention, and so decide at which points the accumulation of mental\nexperiences shall begin.  It might, accordingly, seem as if there were\nno room for any other agency than this; as if the distinction we have\nfound so useful between 'spontaneous variation,' as the producer of\nchanged forms, and the environment, as their preserver and destroyer,\ndid not hold in the case of mental progress; as if, in a word, the\nparallel with darwinism might no longer obtain, and Spencer might be\nquite right with his fundamental law of intelligence, which says, \"The\ncohesion between psychical states is proportionate to the frequency\nwith which the relation between the answering external phenomena has\nbeen repeated in experience.\"[15]\n{247}\nBut, in spite of all these facts, I have no hesitation whatever in\nholding firm to the darwinian distinction even here.  I maintain that\nthe facts in question are all drawn from the lower strata of the mind,\nso to speak,--from the sphere of its least evolved functions, from the\nregion of intelligence which man possesses in common with the brutes.\nAnd I can easily show that throughout the whole extent of those mental\ndepartments which are highest, which are most characteristically human,\nSpencer's law is violated at every step; and that as a matter of fact\nthe new conceptions, emotions, and active tendencies which evolve are\noriginally produced in the shape of random images, fancies, accidental\nout-births of spontaneous variation in the functional activity of the\nexcessively instable human brain, which the outer environment simply\nconfirms or refutes, adopts or rejects, preserves or\ndestroys,--selects, in short, just as it selects morphological and\nsocial variations due to molecular accidents of an analogous sort.\nIt is one of the tritest of truisms that human intelligences of a\nsimple order are very literal.  They are slaves of habit, doing what\nthey have been taught without variation; dry, prosaic, and\nmatter-of-fact in their remarks; devoid of humor, except of the coarse\nphysical kind which rejoices in a practical joke; taking the world for\ngranted; and possessing in their faithfulness and honesty the single\ngift by which they are sometimes able to warm us into admiration.  But\n{248} even this faithfulness seems to have a sort of inorganic ring,\nand to remind us more of the immutable properties of a piece of\ninanimate matter than of the steadfastness of a human will capable of\nalternative choice.  When we descend to the brutes, all these\npeculiarities are intensified.  No reader of Schopenhauer can forget\nhis frequent allusions to the _trockener ernst_ of dogs and horses, nor\nto their _ehrlichkeit_.  And every noticer of their ways must receive a\ndeep impression of the fatally literal character of the few, simple,\nand treadmill-like operations of their minds.\nBut turn to the highest order of minds, and what a change!  Instead of\nthoughts of concrete things patiently following one another in a beaten\ntrack of habitual suggestion, we have the most abrupt cross-cuts and\ntransitions from one idea to another, the most rarefied abstractions\nand discriminations, the most unheard-of combinations of elements, the\nsubtlest associations of analogy; in a word, we seem suddenly\nintroduced into a seething caldron of ideas, where everything is\nfizzling and bobbing about in a state of bewildering activity, where\npartnerships can be joined or loosened in an instant, treadmill routine\nis unknown, and the unexpected seems the only law.  According to the\nidiosyncrasy of the individual, the scintillations will have one\ncharacter or another.  They will be sallies of wit and humor; they will\nbe flashes of poetry and eloquence; they will be constructions of\ndramatic fiction or of mechanical device, logical or philosophic\nabstractions, business projects, or scientific hypotheses, with trains\nof experimental consequences based thereon; they will be musical\nsounds, or images of plastic beauty or picturesqueness, or visions of\nmoral harmony.  But, whatever their {249} differences may be, they will\nall agree in this,--that their genesis is sudden and, as it were,\nspontaneous.  That is to say, the same premises would not, in the mind\nof another individual, have engendered just that conclusion; although,\nwhen the conclusion is offered to the other individual, he may\nthoroughly accept and enjoy it, and envy the brilliancy of him to whom\nit first occurred.\nTo Professor Jevons is due the great credit of having emphatically\npointed out[16] how the genius of discovery depends altogether on the\nnumber of these random notions and guesses which visit the\ninvestigator's mind.  To be fertile in hypotheses is the first\nrequisite, and to be willing to throw them away the moment experience\ncontradicts them is the next.  The Baconian method of collating tables\nof instances may be a useful aid at certain times.  But one might as\nwell expect a chemist's note-book to write down the name of the body\nanalyzed, or a weather table to sum itself up into a prediction of\nprobabilities of its own accord, as to hope that the mere fact of\nmental confrontation with a certain series of facts will be sufficient\nto make _any_ brain conceive their law.  The conceiving of the law is a\nspontaneous variation in the strictest sense of the term.  It flashes\nout of one brain, and no other, because the instability of that brain\nis such as to tip and upset itself in just that particular direction.\nBut the important thing to notice is that the good flashes and the bad\nflashes, the triumphant hypotheses and the absurd conceits, are on an\nexact equality in respect of their origin.  Aristotle's absurd Physics\nand his immortal Logic flow from one source: the forces that produce\nthe one produce the other.  {250} When walking along the street,\nthinking of the blue sky or the fine spring weather, I may either smile\nat some grotesque whim which occurs to me, or I may suddenly catch an\nintuition of the solution of a long-unsolved problem, which at that\nmoment was far from my thoughts.  Both notions are shaken out of the\nsame reservoir,--the reservoir of a brain in which the reproduction of\nimages in the relations of their outward persistence or frequency has\nlong ceased to be the dominant law.  But to the thought, when it is\nonce engendered, the consecration of agreement with outward relations\nmay come.  The conceit perishes in a moment, and is forgotten.  The\nscientific hypothesis arouses in me a fever of desire for verification.\nI read, write, experiment, consult experts.  Everything corroborates my\nnotion, which being then published in a book spreads from review to\nreview and from mouth to mouth, till at last there is no doubt I am\nenshrined in the Pantheon of the great diviners of nature's ways.  The\nenvironment _preserves_ the conception which it was unable to _produce_\nin any brain less idiosyncratic than my own.\nNow, the spontaneous upsettings of brains this way and that at\nparticular moments into particular ideas and combinations are matched\nby their equally spontaneous permanent tiltings or saggings towards\ndeterminate directions.  The humorous bent is quite characteristic; the\nsentimental one equally so.  And the personal tone of each mind, which\nmakes it more alive to certain classes of experience than others, more\nattentive to certain impressions, more open to certain reasons, is\nequally the result of that invisible and unimaginable play of the\nforces of growth within the nervous system which, irresponsibly to the\n{251} environment, makes the brain peculiarly apt to function in a\ncertain way.  Here again the selection goes on.  The products of the\nmind with the determined aesthetic bent please or displease the\ncommunity.  We adopt Wordsworth, and grow unsentimental and serene.  We\nare fascinated by Schopenhauer, and learn from him the true luxury of\nwoe.  The adopted bent becomes a ferment in the community, and alters\nits tone.  The alteration may be a benefit or a misfortune, for it is\n(_pace_ Mr. Allen) a differentiation from within, which has to run the\ngauntlet of the larger environment's selective power.  Civilized\nLanguedoc, taking the tone of its scholars, poets, princes, and\ntheologians, fell a prey to its rude Catholic environment in the\nAlbigensian crusade.  France in 1792, taking the tone of its St. Justs\nand Marats, plunged into its long career of unstable outward relations.\nPrussia in 1806, taking the tone of its Humboldts and its Steins,\nproved itself in the most signal way 'adjusted' to its environment in\n1872.\nMr. Spencer, in one of the strangest chapters of his Psychology,[17]\ntries to show the necessary order in which the development of\nconceptions in the human race occurs.  No abstract conception can be\ndeveloped, according to him, until the outward experiences have reached\na certain degree of heterogeneity, definiteness, coherence, and so\nforth.\n\"Thus the belief in an unchanging order, the belief in _law_, is a\nbelief of which the primitive man is absolutely incapable....\nExperiences such as he receives furnish but few data for the conception\nof uniformity, whether as displayed in things or in relations....  The\ndaily {252} impressions which the savage gets yield the notion very\nimperfectly, and in but few cases.  Of all the objects around,--trees,\nstones, hills, pieces of water, clouds, and so forth,--most differ\nwidely, ... and few approach complete likeness so nearly as to make\ndiscrimination difficult.  Even between animals of the same species it\nrarely happens that, whether alive or dead, they are presented in just\nthe same attitudes....  It is only along with a gradual development of\nthe arts ... that there come frequent experiences of perfectly straight\nlines admitting of complete apposition, bringing the perceptions of\nequality and inequality.  Still more devoid is savage life of the\nexperiences which generate the conception of the uniformity of\nsuccession.  The sequences observed from hour to hour and day to day\nseem anything but uniform, difference is a far more conspicuous trait\namong them....  So that if we contemplate primitive human life as a\nwhole, we see that multiformity of sequence, rather than uniformity, is\nthe notion which it tends to generate....  Only as fast as the practice\nof the arts develops the idea of measure can the consciousness of\nuniformity become clear....  Those conditions furnished by advancing\ncivilization which make possible the notion of uniformity\nsimultaneously make possible the notion of _exactness_....  Hence the\nprimitive man has little experience which cultivates the consciousness\nof what we call _truth_.  How closely allied this is to the\nconsciousness which the practice of the arts cultivates is implied even\nin language.  We speak of a true surface as well as a true statement.\nExactness describes perfection in a mechanical fit, as well as perfect\nagreement between the results of calculations.\"\nThe whole burden of Mr. Spencer's book is to show the fatal way in\nwhich the mind, supposed passive, is moulded by its experiences of\n'outer {253} relations.'  In this chapter the yard-stick, the balance,\nthe chronometer, and other machines and instruments come to figure\namong the 'relations' external to the mind.  Surely they are so, after\nthey have been manufactured; but only because of the preservative power\nof the social environment.  Originally all these things and all other\ninstitutions were flashes of genius in an individual head, of which the\nouter environment showed no sign.  Adopted by the race and become its\nheritage, they then supply instigations to new geniuses whom they\nenviron to make new inventions and discoveries; and so the ball of\nprogress rolls.  But take out the geniuses, or alter their\nidiosyncrasies, and what increasing uniformities will the environment\nshow?  We defy Mr. Spencer or any one else to reply.\nThe plain truth is that the 'philosophy' of evolution (as distinguished\nfrom our special information about particular cases of change) is a\nmetaphysical creed, and nothing else.  It is a mood of contemplation,\nan emotional attitude, rather than a system of thought,--a mood which\nis old as the world, and which no refutation of any one incarnation of\nit (such as the spencerian philosophy) will dispel; the mood of\nfatalistic pantheism, with its intuition of the One and All, which was,\nand is, and ever shall be, and from whose womb each single thing\nproceeds.  Far be it from us to speak slightingly here of so hoary and\nmighty a style of looking on the world as this.  What we at present\ncall scientific discoveries had nothing to do with bringing it to\nbirth, nor can one easily conceive that they should ever give it its\n_quietus_, no matter how logically incompatible with its spirit the\nultimate phenomenal distinctions which {254} science accumulates should\nturn out to be.  It can laugh at the phenomenal distinctions on which\nscience is based, for it draws its vital breath from a region\nwhich--whether above or below--is at least altogether different from\nthat in which science dwells.  A critic, however, who cannot disprove\nthe truth of the metaphysic creed, can at least raise his voice in\nprotest against its disguising itself in 'scientific' plumes.  I think\nthat all who have had the patience to follow me thus far will agree\nthat the spencerian 'philosophy' of social and intellectual progress is\nan obsolete anachronism, reverting to a pre-darwinian type of thought,\njust as the spencerian philosophy of 'Force,' effacing all the previous\ndistinctions between actual and potential energy, momentum, work,\nforce, mass, etc., which physicists have with so much agony achieved,\ncarries us back to a pre-galilean age.\n[1] A lecture before the Harvard Natural History Society; published in\nthe Atlantic Monthly, October, 1880.\n[2] Darwin's theory of pangenesis is, it is true, an attempt to account\n(among other things) for variation.  But it occupies its own separate\nplace, and its author no more invokes the environment when he talks of\nthe adhesions of gemmules than he invokes these adhesions when he talks\nof the relations of the whole animal to the environment.  _Divide et\nimpera!_\n[3] It is true that it remodels him, also, to some degree, by its\neducative influence, and that this constitutes a considerable\ndifference between the social case and the zo\u00f6logical case, I neglect\nthis aspect of the relation here, for the other is the more important.\nAt the end of the article I will return to it incidentally.\n[4] The reader will remember when this was written.\n[5] Lectures and Essays, i. 82.\n[6] Mr. Grant Allen himself, in an article from which I shall presently\nquote, admits that a set of people who, if they had been exposed ages\nago to the geographical agencies of Timbuctoo, would have developed\ninto negroes might now, after a protracted exposure to the conditions\nof Hamburg, never become negroes if transplanted to Timbuctoo.\n[7] Study of Sociology, pages 33-35.\n[8] No! not even though they were bodily brothers!  The geographical\nfactor utterly vanishes before the ancestral factor.  The difference\nbetween Hamburg and Timbuctoo as a cause of ultimate divergence of two\nraces is as nothing to the difference of constitution of the ancestors\nof the two races, even though as in twin brothers, this difference\nmight be invisible to the naked eye.  No two couples of the most\nhomogeneous race could possibly be found so identical as, if set in\nidentical environments, to give rise to two identical lineages.  The\nminute divergence at the start grows broader with each generation, and\nends with entirely dissimilar breeds.\n[9] Article 'Nation Making,' in Gentleman's Magazine, 1878.  I quote\nfrom the reprint in the Popular Science Monthly Supplement December,\n1878, pages 121, 123, 126.\n[10] Article 'Hellas,' in Gentleman's Magazine, 1878.  Reprint in\nPopular Science Monthly Supplement, September, 1878.\n[11] Vol. cxiii. p. 318 (October, 1871).\n[12] I am well aware that in much that follows (though in nothing that\nprecedes) I seem to be crossing the heavily shotted bows of Mr. Galton,\nfor whose laborious investigations into the heredity of genius I have\nthe greatest respect.  Mr. Galton inclines to think that genius of\nintellect and passion is bound to express itself, whatever the outward\nopportunity, and that within any given race an equal number of geniuses\nof each grade must needs be born in every equal period of time; a\nsubordinate race cannot possibly engender a large number of high-class\ngeniuses, etc.  He would, I suspect, infer the suppositions I go on to\nmake--of great men fortuitously assembling around a given epoch and\nmaking it great, and of their being fortuitously absent from certain\nplaces and times (from Sardinia, from Boston now, etc.)--to be\nradically vicious.  I hardly think, however, that he does justice to\nthe great complexity of the conditions of _effective_ greatness, and to\nthe way in which the physiological averages of production may be masked\nentirely during long periods, either by the accidental mortality of\ngeniuses in infancy, or by the fact that the particular geniuses born\nhappened not to find tasks.  I doubt the truth of his assertion that\n_intellectual_ genius, like murder, 'will out.' It is true that certain\ntypes are irrepressible.  Voltaire, Shelley, Carlyle, can hardly be\nconceived leading a dumb and vegetative life in any epoch.  But take\nMr. Galton himself, take his cousin Mr. Darwin, and take Mr. Spencer:\nnothing is to me more have died 'with all their music in them,' known\nonly to their friends as persons of strong and original character and\njudgment.  What has started them on their career of effective greatness\nis simply the accident of each stumbling upon a task vast, brilliant,\nand congenial enough to call out the convergence of all his passions\nand powers.  I see no more reason why, in case they had not fallen in\nwith their several hobbies at propitious periods in their life, they\nneed necessarily have hit upon other hobbies, and made themselves\nequally great.  Their case seems similar to that of the Washingtons,\nCromwells, and Grants, who simply rose to their occasions.  But apart\nfrom these causes of fallacy, I am strongly disposed to think that\nwhere transcendent geniuses are concerned the numbers anyhow are so\nsmall that their appearance will not fit into any scheme of averages.\nThat is, two or three might appear together, just as the two or three\nballs nearest the target centre might be fired consecutively.  Take\nlonger epochs and more firing, and the great geniuses and near balls\nwould on the whole be more spread out.\n[13] Since this paper was written, President Cleveland has to a certain\nextent met the need.  But who can doubt that if he had certain other\nqualities which he has not yet shown, his influence would have been\nstill more decisive?  (1896.)\n[14] That is, if a certain general character be rapidly repeated in our\nouter experience with a number of strongly contrasted concomitants, it\nwill be sooner abstracted than if its associates are invariable or\nmonotonous.\n[14] Principles of Psychology, i. 460.  See also pp. 463, 464, 500.  On\npage 408 the law is formulated thus: The _persistence_ of the\nconnection in consciousness is proportionate to the _persistence_ of\nthe outer connection.  Mr. Spencer works most with the law of\nfrequency.  Either law, from my point of view, is false; but Mr.\nSpencer ought not to think them synonymous.\n[16] In his Principles of Science, chapters xi., xii., xxvi.\n[17] Part viii. chap. iii.\n{255}\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUALS.\nThe previous Essay, on Great Men, etc., called forth two replies,--one\nby Mr. Grant Allen, entitled the 'Genesis of Genius,' in the Atlantic\nMonthly, vol. xlvii. p. 351; the other entitled 'Sociology and Hero\nWorship,' by Mr. John Fiske, _ibidem_, p. 75.  The article which\nfollows is a rejoinder to Mr. Allen's article.  It was refused at the\ntime by the Atlantic, but saw the day later in the Open Court for\nAugust, 1890.  It appears here as a natural supplement to the foregoing\narticle, on which it casts some explanatory light.\nMr. Allen's contempt for hero-worship is based on very simple\nconsiderations.  A nation's great men, he says, are but slight\ndeviations from the general level.  The hero is merely a special\ncomplex of the ordinary qualities of his race.  The petty differences\nimpressed upon ordinary Greek minds by Plato or Aristotle or Zeno, are\nnothing at all compared with the vast differences between every Greek\nmind and every Egyptian or Chinese mind.  We may neglect them in a\nphilosophy of history, just as in calculating the impetus of a\nlocomotive we neglect the extra impetus given by a single piece of\nbetter coal.  What each man adds is but an infinitesimal fraction\ncompared with what he derives from his parents, or {256} indirectly\nfrom his earlier ancestry.  And if what the past gives to the hero is\nso much bulkier than what the future receives from him, it is what\nreally calls for philosophical treatment.  The problem for the\nsociologist is as to what produces the average man; the extraordinary\nmen and what they produce may by the philosophers be taken for granted,\nas too trivial variations to merit deep inquiry.\nNow, as I wish to vie with Mr. Allen's unrivalled polemic amiability\nand be as conciliatory as possible, I will not cavil at his facts or\ntry to magnify the chasm between an Aristotle, a Goethe, or a Napoleon\nand the average level of their respective tribes.  Let it be as small\nas Mr. Allen thinks.  All that I object to is that he should think the\nmere _size_ of a difference is capable of deciding whether that\ndifference be or be not a fit subject for philosophic study.  Truly\nenough, the details vanish in the bird's-eye view; but so does the\nbird's-eye view vanish in the details.  Which is the right point of\nview for philosophic vision?  Nature gives no reply, for both points of\nview, being equally real, are equally natural; and no one natural\nreality _per se_ is any more emphatic than any other.  Accentuation,\nforeground, and background are created solely by the interested\nattention of the looker-on; and if the small difference between the\ngenius and his tribe interests me most, while the large one between\nthat tribe and another tribe interests Mr. Allen, our controversy\ncannot be ended until a complete philosophy, accounting for all\ndifferences impartially, shall justify us both.\nAn unlearned carpenter of my acquaintance once said in my hearing:\n\"There is very little difference between one man and another; but what\nlittle there {257} is, _is very important_.\"  This distinction seems to\nme to go to the root of the matter.  It is not only the size of the\ndifference which concerns the philosopher, but also its place and its\nkind.  An inch is a small thing, but we know the proverb about an inch\non a man's nose.  Messrs. Allen and Spencer, in inveighing against\nhero-worship, are thinking exclusively of the size of the inch; I, as a\nhero-worshipper, attend to its seat and function.\nNow, there is a striking law over which few people seem to have\npondered.  It is this: That among all the differences which exist, the\nonly ones that interest us strongly are those _we do not take for\ngranted_.  We are not a bit elated that our friend should have two\nhands and the power of speech, and should practise the matter-of-course\nhuman virtues; and quite as little are we vexed that our dog goes on\nall fours and fails to understand our conversation.  Expecting no more\nfrom the latter companion, and no less from the former, we get what we\nexpect and are satisfied.  We never think of communing with the dog by\ndiscourse of philosophy, or with the friend by head-scratching or the\nthrowing of crusts to be snapped at.  But if either dog or friend fall\nabove or below the expected standard, they arouse the most lively\nemotion.  On our brother's vices or genius we never weary of\ndescanting; to his bipedism or his hairless skin we do not consecrate a\nthought.  _What_ he says may transport us; that he is able to speak at\nall leaves us stone cold.  The reason of all this is that his virtues\nand vices and utterances might, compatibly with the current range of\nvariation in our tribe, be just the opposites of what they are, while\nhis zo\u00f6logically human attributes cannot possibly go astray.  There\n{258} is thus a zone of insecurity in human affairs in which all the\ndramatic interest lies; the rest belongs to the dead machinery of the\nstage.  This is the formative zone, the part not yet ingrained into the\nrace's average, not yet a typical, hereditary, and constant factor of\nthe social community in which it occurs.  It is like the soft layer\nbeneath the bark of the tree in which all the year's growth is going\non.  Life has abandoned the mighty trunk inside, which stands inert and\nbelongs almost to the inorganic world.  Layer after layer of human\nperfection separates me from the central Africans who pursued Stanley\nwith cries of \"meat, meat!\"  This vast difference ought, on Mr. Allen's\nprinciples, to rivet my attention far more than the petty one which\nobtains between two such birds of a feather as Mr. Allen and myself.\nYet while I never feel proud that the sight of a passer-by awakens in\nme no cannibalistic waterings of the mouth, I am free to confess that I\nshall feel very proud if I do not publicly appear inferior to Mr. Allen\nin the conduct of this momentous debate.  To me as a teacher the\nintellectual gap between my ablest and my dullest student counts for\ninfinitely more than that between the latter and the amphioxus: indeed,\nI never thought of the latter chasm till this moment.  Will Mr. Allen\nseriously say that this is all human folly, and tweedledum and\ntweedledee?\nTo a Veddah's eyes the differences between two white literary men seem\nslight indeed,--same clothes, same spectacles, same harmless\ndisposition, same habit of scribbling on paper and poring over books,\netc.  \"Just two white fellows,\" the Veddah will say, \"with no\nperceptible difference.\"  But what a difference to the literary men\nthemselves!  Think, Mr. Allen, of {259} confounding our philosophies\ntogether merely because both are printed in the same magazines and are\nindistinguishable to the eye of a Veddah!  Our flesh creeps at the\nthought.\nBut in judging of history Mr. Allen deliberately prefers to place\nhimself at the Veddah's point of view, and to see things _en gros_ and\nout of focus, rather than minutely.  It is quite true that there are\nthings and differences enough to be seen either way.  But which are the\nhumanly important ones, those most worthy to arouse our interest,--the\nlarge distinctions or the small?  In the answer to this question lies\nthe whole divergence of the hero-worshippers from the sociologists.  As\nI said at the outset, it is merely a quarrel of emphasis; and the only\nthing I can do is to state my personal reasons for the emphasis I\nprefer.\nThe zone of the individual differences, and of the social 'twists'\nwhich by common confession they initiate, is the zone of formative\nprocesses, the dynamic belt of quivering uncertainty, the line where\npast and future meet.  It is the theatre of all we do not take for\ngranted, the stage of the living drama of life; and however narrow its\nscope, it is roomy enough to lodge the whole range of human passions.\nThe sphere of the race's average, on the contrary, no matter how large\nit may be, is a dead and stagnant thing, an achieved possession, from\nwhich all insecurity has vanished.  Like the trunk of a tree, it has\nbeen built up by successive concretions of successive active zones.\nThe moving present in which we live with its problems and passions, its\nindividual rivalries, victories, and defeats, will soon pass over to\nthe majority and leave its small deposit on this static mass, to make\nroom for fresh actors and a newer play.  {260} And though it may be\ntrue, as Mr. Spencer predicts, that each later zone shall fatally be\nnarrower than its forerunners; and that when the ultimate lady-like\ntea-table elysium of the Data of Ethics shall prevail, such questions\nas the breaking of eggs at the large or the small end will span the\nwhole scope of possible human warfare,--still even in this shrunken and\nenfeebled generation, _spatio aetatis defessa vetusto_, what eagerness\nthere will be!  Battles and defeats will occur, the victors will be\nglorified and the vanquished dishonored just as in the brave days of\nyore, the human heart still withdrawing itself from the much it has in\nsafe possession, and concentrating all its passion upon those\nevanescent possibilities of fact which still quiver in fate's scale.\nAnd is not its instinct right?  Do not we here grasp the\nrace-differences _in the making_, and catch the only glimpse it is\nallotted to us to attain of the working units themselves, of whose\ndifferentiating action the race-gaps form but the stagnant sum?  What\nstrange inversion of scientific procedure does Mr. Allen practise when\nhe teaches us to neglect elements and attend only to aggregate\nresultants?  On the contrary, simply because the active ring, whatever\nits bulk, _is elementary_, I hold that the study of its conditions (be\nthese never so 'proximate') is the highest of topics for the social\nphilosopher.  If individual variations determine its ups and downs and\nhair-breadth escapes and twists and turns, as Mr. Allen and Mr. Fiske\nboth admit, Heaven forbid us from tabooing the study of these in favor\nof the average!  On the contrary, let us emphasize these, and the\nimportance of these; and in picking out from history our heroes, and\ncommuning with their {261} kindred spirits,--in imagining as strongly\nas possible what differences their individualities brought about in\nthis world, while its surface was still plastic in their hands, and\nwhat whilom feasibilities they made impossible,--each one of us may\nbest fortify and inspire what creative energy may lie in his own\nsoul.[1]\nThis is the lasting justification of hero-worship, and the pooh-poohing\nof it by 'sociologists' is the ever-lasting excuse for popular\nindifference to their general laws and averages.  The difference\nbetween an America rescued by a Washington or by a 'Jenkins' may, as\nMr. Allen says, be 'little,' but it is, in the words of my carpenter\nfriend, 'important.'  Some organizing genius must in the nature of\nthings have emerged from the French Revolution; but what Frenchman will\naffirm it to have been an accident of no consequence that he should\nhave had the supernumerary idiosyncrasies of a Bonaparte?  What animal,\ndomestic or wild, will call it a matter of no moment that scarce a word\nof sympathy with brutes should have survived from the teachings of\nJesus of Nazareth?\nThe preferences of sentient creatures are what _create_ the importance\nof topics.  They are the absolute and ultimate law-giver here.  And I\nfor my part cannot but consider the talk of the contemporary\nsociological school about averages and general laws and predetermined\ntendencies, with its obligatory undervaluing of the importance of\nindividual {262} differences, as the most pernicious and immoral of\nfatalisms.  Suppose there is a social equilibrium fated to be, whose is\nit to be,--that of your preference, or mine?  There lies the question\nof questions, and it is one which no study of averages can decide.\n[1] M. G. Tarde's book (itself a work of genius), Les Lois de\nl'Imitation, \u00c9tude Sociologique (2me \u00c9dition, Paris, Alcan, 1895), is\nthe best possible commentary on this text,--'invention' on the one\nhand, and 'imitation' on the other, being for this author the two sole\nfactors of social change.\n{263}\nON SOME HEGELISMS.[1]\nWe are just now witnessing a singular phenomenon in British and\nAmerican philosophy.  Hegelism, so defunct on its native soil that I\nbelieve but a single youthful disciple of the school is to be counted\namong the privat-docenten and younger professors of Germany, and whose\nolder champions are all passing off the stage, has found among us so\nzealous and able a set of propagandists that to-day it may really be\nreckoned one of the most powerful influences of the time in the higher\nwalks of thought.  And there is no doubt that, as a movement of\nreaction against the traditional British empiricism, the hegelian\ninfluence represents expansion and freedom, and is doing service of a\ncertain kind.  Such service, however, ought not to make us blindly\nindulgent.  Hegel's philosophy mingles mountain-loads of corruption\nwith its scanty merits, and must, now that it has become\nquasi-official, make ready to defend itself as well as to attack\nothers.  It is with no hope of converting independent thinkers, but\nrather with the sole aspiration of showing some chance youthful\ndisciple that there _is_ another point of view in philosophy that I\nfire this skirmisher's shot, which may, I hope, soon be followed by\nsomebody else's heavier musketry.\n{264}\nThe point of view I have in mind will become clearer if I begin with a\nfew preparatory remarks on the motives and difficulties of\nphilosophizing in general.\nTo show that the real is identical with the ideal may roughly be set\ndown as the mainspring of philosophic activity.  The atomic and\nmechanical conception of the world is as ideal from the point of view\nof some of our faculties as the teleological one is from the point of\nview of others.  In the realm of every ideal we can begin anywhere and\nroam over the field, each term passing us to its neighbor, each member\ncalling for the next, and our reason rejoicing in its glad activity.\nWhere the parts of a conception seem thus to belong together by inward\nkinship, where the whole is defined in a way congruous with our powers\nof reaction, to see is to approve and to understand.\nMuch of the real seems at the first blush to follow a different law.\nThe parts seem, as Hegel has said, to be shot out of a pistol at us.\nEach asserts itself as a simple brute fact, uncalled for by the rest,\nwhich, so far as we can see, might even make a better system without\nit.  Arbitrary, foreign, jolting, discontinuous--are the adjectives by\nwhich we are tempted to describe it.  And yet from out the bosom of it\na partial ideality constantly arises which keeps alive our aspiration\nthat the whole may some day be construed in ideal form.  Not only do\nthe materials lend themselves under certain circumstances to aesthetic\nmanipulation, but underlying their worst disjointedness are three great\ncontinua in which for each of us reason's ideal is actually reached.  I\nmean the continua of memory or personal consciousness, of time and of\nspace.  In {265} these great matrices of all we know, we are absolutely\nat home.  The things we meet are many, and yet are one; each is itself,\nand yet all belong together; continuity reigns, yet individuality is\nnot lost.\nConsider, for example, space.  It is a unit.  No force can in any way\nbreak, wound, or tear it.  It has no joints between which you can pass\nyour amputating knife, for it penetrates the knife and is not split,\nTry to make a hole in space by annihilating an inch of it.  To make a\nhole you must drive something else through.  But what can you drive\nthrough space except what is itself spatial?\nBut notwithstanding it is this very paragon of unity, space in its\nparts contains an infinite variety, and the unity and the variety do\nnot contradict each other, for they obtain in different respects.  The\none is the whole, the many are the parts.  Each part is one again, but\nonly one fraction; and part lies beside part in absolute nextness, the\nvery picture of peace and non-contradiction.  It is true that the space\nbetween two points both unites and divides them, just as the bar of a\ndumb-bell both unites and divides the two balls.  But the union and the\ndivision are not _secundum idem_: it divides them by keeping them out\nof the space between, it unites them by keeping them out of the space\nbeyond; so the double function presents no inconsistency.\nSelf-contradiction in space could only ensue if one part tried to oust\nanother from its position; but the notion of such an absurdity vanishes\nin the framing, and cannot stay to vex the mind.[2]  Beyond the parts\nwe see or think at any {266} given time extend further parts; but the\nbeyond is homogeneous with what is embraced, and follows the same law;\nso that no surprises, no foreignness, can ever emerge from space's womb.\nThus with space our intelligence is absolutely intimate; it is\nrationality and transparency incarnate.  The same may be said of the\nego and of time.  But if for simplicity's sake we ignore them, we may\ntruly say that when we desiderate rational knowledge of the world the\nstandard set by our knowledge of space is what governs our desire.[3]\nCannot the breaks, the jolts, the margin of foreignness, be exorcised\nfrom other things and leave them unitary like the space they fill?\nCould this be done, the philosophic kingdom of heaven would be at hand.\nBut the moment we turn to the material qualities {267} of being, we\nfind the continuity ruptured on every side.  A fearful jolting begins.\nEven if we simplify the world by reducing it to its mechanical bare\npoles,--atoms and their motions,--the discontinuity is bad enough.  The\nlaws of clash, the effects of distance upon attraction and repulsion,\nall seem arbitrary collocations of data.  The atoms themselves are so\nmany independent facts, the existence of any one of which in no wise\nseems to involve the existence of the rest.  We have not banished\ndiscontinuity, we have only made it finer-grained.  And to get even\nthat degree of rationality into the universe we have had to butcher a\ngreat part of its contents.  The secondary qualities we stripped off\nfrom the reality and swept into the dust-bin labelled 'subjective\nillusion,' still _as such_ are facts, and must themselves be\nrationalized in some way.\nBut when we deal with facts believed to be purely subjective, we are\nfarther than ever from the goal.  We have not now the refuge of\ndistinguishing between the 'reality' and its appearances.  Facts of\nthought being the only facts, differences of thought become the only\ndifferences, and identities of thought the only identities there are.\nTwo thoughts that seem different are different to all eternity.  We can\nno longer speak of heat and light being reconciled in any _tertium\nquid_ like wave-motion.  For motion is motion, and light is light, and\nheat heat forever, and their discontinuity is as absolute as their\nexistence.  Together with the other attributes and things we conceive,\nthey make up Plato's realm of immutable ideas.  Neither _per se_ calls\nfor the other, hatches it out, is its 'truth,' creates it, or has any\nsort of inward community with it except that of being comparable {268}\nin an ego and found more or less differing, or more or less resembling,\nas the case may be.  The world of qualities is a world of things almost\nwholly discontinuous _inter se_.  Each only says, \"I am that I am,\" and\neach says it on its own account and with absolute monotony.  The\ncontinuities of which they _partake_, in Plato's phrase, the ego,\nspace, and time, are for most of them the only grounds of union they\npossess.\nIt might seem as if in the mere 'partaking' there lay a contradiction\nof the discontinuity.  If the white must partake of space, the heat of\ntime, and so forth,--do not whiteness and space, heat and time,\nmutually call for or help to create each other?\nYes; a few such _\u00e0 priori_ couplings must be admitted.  They are the\naxioms: no feeling except as occupying some space and time, or as a\nmoment in some ego; no motion but of something moved; no thought but of\nan object; no time without a previous time,--and the like.  But they\nare limited in number, and they obtain only between excessively broad\ngenera of concepts, and leave quite undetermined what the\nspecifications of those genera shall be.  What feeling shall fill\n_this_ time, what substance execute _this_ motion, what qualities\ncombine in _this_ being, are as much unanswered questions as if the\nmetaphysical axioms never existed at all.\nThe existence of such syntheses as they are does then but slightly\nmitigate the jolt, jolt, jolt we get when we pass over the facts of the\nworld.  Everywhere indeterminate variables, subject only to these few\nvague enveloping laws, independent in all besides.--such seems the\ntruth.\nIn yet another way, too, ideal and real are so far {269} apart that\ntheir conjunction seems quite hopeless.  To eat our cake and have it,\nto lose our soul and save it, to enjoy the physical privileges of\nselfishness and the moral luxury of altruism at the same time, would be\nthe ideal.  But the real offers us these terms in the shape of mutually\nexclusive alternatives of which only one can be true at once; so that\nwe must choose, and in choosing murder one possibility.  The wrench is\nabsolute: \"Either--or!\"  Just as whenever I bet a hundred dollars on an\nevent, there comes an instant when I am a hundred dollars richer or\npoorer without any intermediate degrees passed over; just as my\nwavering between a journey to Portland or to New York does not carry me\nfrom Cambridge in a resultant direction in which both motions are\ncompounded, say to Albany, but at a given moment results in the\nconjunction of reality in all its fulness for one alternative and\nimpossibility in all its fulness for the other,--so the bachelor joys\nare utterly lost from the face of being for the married man, who must\nhenceforward find his account in something that is not them but is good\nenough to make him forget them; so the careless and irresponsible\nliving in the sunshine, the 'unbuttoning after supper and sleeping upon\nbenches in the afternoon,' are stars that have set upon the path of him\nwho in good earnest makes himself a moralist.  The transitions are\nabrupt, absolute, truly shot out of a pistol; for while many\npossibilities are called, the few that are chosen are chosen in all\ntheir sudden completeness.\nMust we then think that the world that fills space and time can yield\nus no acquaintance of that high and perfect type yielded by empty space\nand time themselves?  Is what unity there is in the world {270} mainly\nderived from the fact that the world is _in_ space and time and\n'partakes' of them?  Can no vision of it forestall the facts of it, or\nknow from some fractions the others before the others have arrived?\nAre there real logically indeterminate possibilities which forbid there\nbeing any equivalent for the happening of it all but the happening\nitself?  Can we gain no anticipatory assurance that what is to come\nwill have no strangeness?  Is there no substitute, in short, for life\nbut the living itself in all its long-drawn weary length and breadth\nand thickness?\nIn the negative reply to all these questions, a modest common-sense\nfinds no difficulty in acquiescing.  To such a way of thinking the\nnotion of 'partaking' has a deep and real significance.  Whoso partakes\nof a thing enjoys his share, and comes into contact with the thing and\nits other partakers.  But he claims no more.  His share in no wise\nnegates the thing or their share; nor does it preclude his possession\nof reserved and private powers with which they have nothing to do, and\nwhich are not all absorbed in the mere function of sharing.  Why may\nnot the world be a sort of republican banquet of this sort, where all\nthe qualities of being respect one another's personal sacredness, yet\nsit at the common table of space and time?\nTo me this view seems deeply probable.  Things cohere, but the act of\ncohesion itself implies but few conditions, and leaves the rest of\ntheir qualifications indeterminate.  As the first three notes of a tune\ncomport many endings, all melodious, but the tune is not named till a\nparticular ending has actually come,--so the parts actually known of\nthe universe may comport many ideally possible complements.  But as\n{271} the facts are not the complements, so the knowledge of the one is\nnot the knowledge of the other in anything but the few necessary\nelements of which all must partake in order to be together at all.\nWhy, if one act of knowledge could from one point take in the total\nperspective, with all mere possibilities abolished, should there ever\nhave been anything more than that act?  Why duplicate it by the tedious\nunrolling, inch by inch, of the foredone reality?  No answer seems\npossible.  On the other hand, if we stipulate only a partial community\nof partially independent powers, we see perfectly why no one part\ncontrols the whole view, but each detail must come and be actually\ngiven, before, in any special sense, it can be said to be determined at\nall.  This is the moral view, the view that gives to other powers the\nsame freedom it would have itself,--not the ridiculous 'freedom to do\nright,' which in my mouth can only mean the freedom to do as _I_ think\nright, but the freedom to do as _they_ think right, or wrong either.\nAfter all, what accounts do the nether-most bounds of the universe owe\nto me?  By what insatiate conceit and lust of intellectual despotism do\nI arrogate the right to know their secrets, and from my philosophic\nthrone to play the only airs they shall march to, as if I were the\nLord's anointed?  Is not my knowing them at all a gift and not a right?\nAnd shall it be given before they are given?  _Data! gifts!_ something\nto be thankful for!  It is a gift that we can approach things at all,\nand, by means of the time and space of which our minds and they\npartake, alter our actions so as to meet them.\nThere are 'bounds of ord'nance' set for all things, where they must\npause or rue it.  'Facts' are the bounds of human knowledge, set for\nit, not by it.\n{272}\nNow, to a mind like Hegel's such pusillanimous twaddle sounds simply\nloathsome.  Bounds that we can't overpass!  Data! facts that say,\n\"Hands off, till we are given\"! possibilities we can't control! a\nbanquet of which we merely share!  Heavens, this is intolerable; such a\nworld is no world for a philosopher to have to do with.  He must have\nall or nothing.  If the world cannot be rational in my sense, in the\nsense of unconditional surrender, I refuse to grant that it is rational\nat all.  It is pure incoherence, a chaos, a nulliverse, to whose\nhaphazard sway I will not truckle.  But, no! this is not the world.\nThe world is philosophy's own,--a single block, of which, if she once\nget her teeth on any part, the whole shall inevitably become her prey\nand feed her all-devouring theoretic maw.  Naught shall be but the\nnecessities she creates and impossibilities; freedom shall mean freedom\nto obey her will, ideal and actual shall be one: she, and I as her\nchampion, will be satisfied on no lower terms.\nThe insolence of sway, the _hubris_ on which gods take vengeance, is in\ntemporal and spiritual matters usually admitted to be a vice.  A\nBonaparte and a Philip II. are called monsters.  But when an\n_intellect_ is found insatiate enough to declare that all existence\nmust bend the knee to its requirements, we do not call its owner a\nmonster, but a philosophic prophet.  May not this be all wrong?  Is\nthere any one of our functions exempted from the common lot of\nliability to excess?  And where everything else must be contented with\nits part in the universe, shall the theorizing faculty ride rough-shod\nover the whole?\nI confess I can see no _\u00e0 priori_ reason for the exception.  He who\nclaims it must be judged by the {273} consequences of his acts, and by\nthem alone.  Let Hegel then confront the universe with his claim, and\nsee how he can make the two match.\nThe universe absolutely refuses to let him travel without jolt.  Time,\nspace, and his ego are continuous; so are degrees of heat, shades of\nlight and color, and a few other serial things; so too do potatoes call\nfor salt, and cranberries for sugar, in the taste of one who knows what\nsalt and sugar are.  But on the whole there is nought to soften the\nshock of surprise to his intelligence, as it passes from one quality of\nbeing to another.  Light is not heat, heat is not light; and to him who\nholds the one the other is not given till it give itself.  Real being\ncomes moreover and goes from any concept at its own sweet will, with no\npermission asked of the conceiver.  In despair must Hegel lift vain\nhands of imprecation; and since he will take nothing but the whole, he\nmust throw away even the part he might retain, and call the nature of\nthings an _absolute_ muddle and incoherence.\nBut, hark!  What wondrous strain is this that steals upon his ear?\nIncoherence itself, may it not be the very sort of coherence I require?\nMuddle! is it anything but a peculiar sort of transparency?  Is not\njolt passage?  Is friction other than a kind of lubrication?  Is not a\nchasm a filling?--a queer kind of filling, but a filling still.  Why\nseek for a glue to hold things together when their very falling apart\nis the only glue you need?  Let all that negation which seemed to\ndisintegrate the universe be the mortar that combines it, and the\nproblem stands solved.  The paradoxical character of the notion could\nnot fail to please a mind monstrous even in its native {274} Germany,\nwhere mental excess is endemic.  Richard, for a moment brought to bay,\nis himself again.  He vaults into the saddle, and from that time his\ncareer is that of a philosophic desperado,--one series of outrages upon\nthe chastity of thought.\nAnd can we not ourselves sympathize with his mood in some degree?  The\nold receipts of squeezing the thistle and taking the bull by the horns\nhave many applications.  An evil frankly accepted loses half its sting\nand all its terror.  The Stoics had their cheap and easy way of dealing\nwith evil.  _Call_ your woes goods, they said; refuse to _call_ your\nlost blessings by that name,--and you are happy.  So of the\nunintelligibilities: call them means of intelligibility, and what\nfurther do you require?  There is even a more legitimate excuse than\nthat.  In the exceedingness of the facts of life over our formulas lies\na standing temptation at certain times to give up trying to say\nanything adequate about them, and to take refuge in wild and whirling\nwords which but confess our impotence before their ineffability.  Thus\nBaron Bunsen writes to his wife: \"Nothing is near but the far; nothing\ntrue but the highest; nothing credible but the inconceivable; nothing\nso real as the impossible; nothing clear but the deepest; nothing so\nvisible as the invisible; and no life is there but through death.\"  Of\nthese ecstatic moments the _credo quia impossibile_ is the classical\nexpression.  Hegel's originality lies in his making their mood\npermanent and sacramental, and authorized to supersede all others,--not\nas a mystical bath and refuge for feeling when tired reason sickens of\nher intellectual responsibilities (thank Heaven! that bath is always\nready), but as the very form of intellectual responsibility itself.\n{275}\nAnd now after this long introduction, let me trace some of Hegel's ways\nof applying his discovery.  His system resembles a mouse-trap, in which\nif you once pass the door you may be lost forever.  Safety lies in not\nentering.  Hegelians have anointed, so to speak, the entrance with\nvarious considerations which, stated in an abstract form, are so\nplausible as to slide us unresistingly and almost unwittingly through\nthe fatal arch.  It is not necessary to drink the ocean to know that it\nis salt; nor need a critic dissect a whole system after proving that\nits premises are rotten.  I shall accordingly confine myself to a few\nof the points that captivate beginners most; and assume that if they\nbreak down, so must the system which they prop.\nFirst of all, Hegel has to do utterly away with the sharing and\npartaking business he so much loathes.  He will not call contradiction\nthe glue in one place and identity in another; that is too\nhalf-hearted.  Contradiction must be a glue universal, and must derive\nits credit from being shown to be latently involved in cases that we\nhitherto supposed to embody pure continuity.  Thus, the relations of an\nego with its objects, of one time with another time, of one place with\nanother place, of a cause with its effect, of a thing with its\nproperties, and especially of parts with wholes, must be shown to\ninvolve contradiction.  Contradiction, shown to lurk in the very heart\nof coherence and continuity, cannot after that be held to defeat them,\nand must be taken as the universal solvent,--or, rather, there is no\nlonger any need of a solvent.  To 'dissolve' things in identity was the\ndream of earlier cruder schools.  Hegel will show that their very\ndifference is their identity, and that {276} in the act of detachment\nthe detachment is undone, and they fall into each other's arms.\nNow, at the very outset it seems rather odd that a philosopher who\npretends that the world is absolutely rational, or in other words that\nit can be completely understood, should fall back on a principle (the\nidentity of contradictories) which utterly defies understanding, and\nobliges him in fact to use the word 'understanding,' whenever it occurs\nin his pages, as a term of contempt.  Take the case of space we used\nabove.  The common man who looks at space believes there is nothing in\nit to be acquainted with beyond what he sees; no hidden machinery, no\nsecrets, nothing but the parts as they lie side by side and make the\nstatic whole.  His intellect is satisfied with accepting space as an\nultimate genus of the given.  But Hegel cries to him: \"Dupe! dost thou\nnot see it to be one nest of incompatibilities?  Do not the unity of\nits wholeness and the diversity of its parts stand in patent\ncontradiction?  Does it not both unite and divide things; and but for\nthis strange and irreconcilable activity, would it be at all?  The\nhidden dynamism of self-contradiction is what incessantly produces the\nstatic appearance by which your sense is fooled.\"\nBut if the man ask how self-contradiction _can_ do all this, and how\nits dynamism may be seen to work, Hegel can only reply by showing him\nthe space itself and saying: \"Lo, _thus_.\"  In other words, instead of\nthe principle of explanation being more intelligible than the thing to\nbe explained, it is absolutely unintelligible if taken by itself, and\nmust appeal to its pretended product to prove its existence.  Surely,\nsuch a system of explaining _notum per ignotum_, of {277} making the\n_explicans_ borrow credentials from the _explicand_, and of creating\nparadoxes and impossibilities where none were suspected, is a strange\ncandidate for the honor of being a complete rationalizer of the world.\nThe principle of the contradictoriness of identity and the identity of\ncontradictories is the essence of the hegelian system.  But what\nprobably washes this principle down most with beginners is the\ncombination in which its author works it with another principle which\nis by no means characteristic of his system, and which, for want of a\nbetter name, might be called the 'principle of totality.'  This\nprinciple says that you cannot adequately know even a part until you\nknow of what whole it forms a part.  As Aristotle writes and Hegel\nloves to quote, an amputated hand is not even a hand.  And as Tennyson\nsays,--\n\"Little flower--but if I could understand\nWhat you are, root and all, and all in all,\nI should know what God and man is.\"\nObviously, until we have taken in all the relations, immediate or\nremote, into which the thing actually enters or potentially may enter,\nwe do not know all _about_ the thing.\nAnd obviously for such an exhaustive acquaintance with the thing, an\nacquaintance with every other thing, actual and potential, near and\nremote, is needed; so that it is quite fair to say that omniscience\nalone can completely know any one thing as it stands.  Standing in a\nworld of relations, that world must be known before the thing is fully\nknown.  This doctrine is of course an integral part of empiricism, an\nintegral part of common-sense.  Since when could good men not apprehend\nthe passing hour {278} in the light of life's larger sweep,--not grow\ndispassionate the more they stretched their view?  Did the 'law of\nsharing' so little legitimate their procedure that a law of identity of\ncontradictories, forsooth, must be trumped up to give it scope?  Out\nupon the idea!\nHume's account of causation is a good illustration of the way in which\nempiricism may use the principle of totality.  We call something a\ncause; but we at the same time deny its effect to be in any latent way\ncontained in or substantially identical with it.  We thus cannot tell\nwhat its causality amounts to until its effect has actually supervened.\nThe effect, then, or something beyond the thing is what makes the thing\nto be so far as it is a cause.  Humism thus says that its causality is\nsomething adventitious and not necessarily given when its other\nattributes are there.  Generalizing this, empiricism contends that we\nmust everywhere distinguish between the intrinsic being of a thing and\nits relations, and, among these, between those that are essential to\nour knowing it at all and those that may be called adventitious.  The\nthing as actually present in a given world is there with _all_ its\nrelations; for it to be known as it _there_ exists, they must be known\ntoo, and it and they form a single fact for any consciousness large\nenough to embrace that world as a unity.  But what constitutes this\nsingleness of fact, this unity?  Empiricism says, Nothing but the\nrelation-yielding matrix in which the several items of the world find\nthemselves embedded,--time, namely, and space, and the mind of the\nknower.  And it says that were some of the items quite different from\nwhat they are and others the same, still, for aught we can see, an\nequally unitary world might be, provided each {279} item were an object\nfor consciousness and occupied a determinate point in space and time.\nAll the adventitious relations would in such a world be changed, along\nwith the intrinsic natures and places of the beings between which they\nobtained; but the 'principle of totality' in knowledge would in no wise\nbe affected.\nBut Hegelism dogmatically denies all this to be possible.  In the first\nplace it says there are no intrinsic natures that may change; in the\nsecond it says there are no adventitious relations.  When the relations\nof what we call a thing are told, no _caput mortuum_ of intrinsicality,\nno 'nature,' is left.  The relations soak up all there is of the thing;\nthe 'items' of the world are but _foci_ of relation with other _foci_\nof relation; and all the relations are necessary.  The unity of the\nworld has nothing to do with any 'matrix.'  The matrix and the items,\neach with all, make a unity, simply because each in truth is all the\nrest.  The proof lies in the _hegelian_ principle of totality, which\ndemands that if any one part be posited alone all the others shall\nforthwith _emanate_ from it and infallibly reproduce the whole.  In the\n_modus operandi_ of the emanation comes in, as I said, that partnership\nof the principle of totality with that of the identity of\ncontradictories which so recommends the latter to beginners in Hegel's\nphilosophy.  To posit one item alone is to deny the rest; to deny them\nis to refer to them; to refer to them is to begin, at least, to bring\nthem on the scene; and to begin is in the fulness of time to end.\nIf we call this a monism, Hegel is quick to cry, Not so!  To say simply\nthat the one item is the rest {280} of the universe is as false and\none-sided as to say that it is simply itself.  It is both and neither;\nand the only condition on which we gain the right to affirm that it is,\nis that we fail not to keep affirming all the while that it is not, as\nwell.  Thus the truth refuses to be expressed in any single act of\njudgment or sentence.  The world appears as a monism _and_ a pluralism,\njust as it appeared in our own introductory exposition.\nBut the trouble that keeps us and Hegel from ever joining hands over\nthis apparent formula of brotherhood is that we distinguish, or try to\ndistinguish, the respects in which the world is one from those in which\nit is many, while all such stable distinctions are what he most\nabominates.  The reader may decide which procedure helps his reason\nmost.  For my own part, the time-honored formula of empiricist\npluralism, that the world cannot be set down in any single proposition,\ngrows less instead of more intelligible when I add, \"And yet the\ndifferent propositions that express it are one!\"  The unity of the\npropositions is that of the mind that harbors them.  Any one who\ninsists that their diversity is in any way itself their unity, can only\ndo so because he loves obscurity and mystification for their own pure\nsakes.\nWhere you meet with a contradiction among realities, Herbart used to\nsay, it shows you have failed to make a real distinction.  Hegel's\nsovereign method of going to work and saving all possible\ncontradictions, lies in pertinaciously refusing to distinguish.  He\ntakes what is true of a term _secundum quid_, treats it as true of the\nsame term _simpliciter_, and then, of course, applies it to the term\n_secundum aliud_.  A {281} good example of this is found in the first\ntriad.  This triad shows that the mutability of the real world is due\nto the fact that being constantly negates itself; that whatever _is_ by\nthe same act _is not_, and gets undone and swept away; and that thus\nthe irremediable torrent of life about which so much rhetoric has been\nwritten has its roots in an ineluctable necessity which lies revealed\nto our logical reason.  This notion of a being which forever stumbles\nover its own feet, and has to change in order to exist at all, is a\nvery picturesque symbol of the reality, and is probably one of the\npoints that make young readers feel as if a deep core of truth lay in\nthe system.\nBut how is the reasoning done?  Pure being is assumed, without\ndeterminations, being _secundum quid_.  In this respect it agrees with\nnothing.  Therefore _simpliciter_ it is nothing; wherever we find it,\nit is nothing; crowned with complete determinations then, or _secundum\naliud_, it is nothing still, and _hebt sich auf_.\nIt is as if we said, Man without his clothes may be named 'the naked.'\nTherefore man _simpliciter_ is the naked; and finally man with his hat,\nshoes, and overcoat on is the naked still.\nOf course we may in this instance or any other repeat that the\nconclusion is strictly true, however comical it seems.  Man within the\nclothes is naked, just as he is without them.  Man would never have\ninvented the clothes had he not been naked.  The fact of his being clad\nat all does prove his essential nudity.  And so in general,--the form\nof any judgment, being the addition of a predicate to a subject, shows\nthat the subject has been conceived without the predicate, and thus by\na strained metaphor may {282} be called the predicate's negation.  Well\nand good! let the expression pass.  But we must notice this.  The\njudgment has now created a new subject, the naked-clad, and all\npropositions regarding this must be judged on their own merits; for\nthose true of the old subject, 'the naked,' are no longer true of this\none.  For instance, we cannot say because the naked pure and simple\nmust not enter the drawing-room or is in danger of taking cold, that\nthe naked with his clothes on will also take cold or must stay in his\nbedroom.  Hold to it eternally that the clad man _is_ still naked if it\namuse you,--'tis designated in the bond; but the so-called\ncontradiction is a sterile boon.  Like Shylock's pound of flesh, it\nleads to no consequences.  It does not entitle you to one drop of his\nChristian blood either in the way of catarrh, social exclusion, or what\nfurther results pure nakedness may involve.\nIn a version of the first step given by our foremost American\nHegelian,[4] we find this playing with the necessary form of judgment.\nPure being, he says, has no determinations.  But the having none is\nitself a determination.  Wherefore pure being contradicts its own self,\nand so on.  Why not take heed to the _meaning_ of what is said?  When\nwe make the predication concerning pure being, our meaning is merely\nthe denial of all other determinations than the particular one we make.\nThe showman who advertised his elephant as 'larger than any elephant in\nthe world except himself' must have been in an hegelian country where\nhe was afraid that if he were less explicit the audience would\ndialectically proceed to say: {283} \"This elephant, larger than any in\nthe world, involves a contradiction; for he himself is in the world,\nand so stands endowed with the virtue of being both larger and smaller\nthan himself,--a perfect hegelian elephant, whose immanent\nself-contradictoriness can only be removed in a higher synthesis.  Show\nus the higher synthesis!  We don't care to see such a mere abstract\ncreature as your elephant.\"  It may be (and it was indeed suggested in\nantiquity) that all things are of their own size by being both larger\nand smaller than themselves.  But in the case of this elephant the\nscrupulous showman nipped such philosophizing and all its inconvenient\nconsequences in the bud, by explicitly intimating that larger than any\n_other_ elephant was all he meant.\nHegel's quibble with this word _other_ exemplifies the same fallacy.\nAll 'others,' as such, are according to him identical.  That is,\n'otherness,' which can only be predicated of a given thing _A_,\n_secundum quid_ (as other than _B_, etc.), is predicated _simpliciter_,\nand made to identify the _A_ in question with _B_, which is other only\n_secundum aliud_,--namely other than _A_.\nAnother maxim that Hegelism is never tired of repeating is that \"to\nknow a limit is already to be beyond it.\"  \"Stone walls do not a prison\nmake, nor iron bars a cage.\"  The inmate of the penitentiary shows by\nhis grumbling that he is still in the stage of abstraction and of\nseparative thought.  The more keenly he thinks of the fun he might be\nhaving outside, the more deeply he ought to feel that the walls\nidentify him with it.  They set him beyond them _secundum quid_, in\nimagination, in longing, in despair; _argal_ they take him there\n_simpliciter_ and {284} in every way,--in flesh, in power, in deed.\nFoolish convict, to ignore his blessings!\nAnother mode of stating his principle is this: \"To know the finite as\nsuch, is also to know the infinite.\"  Expressed in this abstract shape,\nthe formula is as insignificant as it is unobjectionable.  We can cap\nevery word with a negative particle, and the word _finished_\nimmediately suggests the word _unfinished_, and we know the two words\ntogether.\nBut it is an entirely different thing to take the knowledge of a\nconcrete case of ending, and to say that it virtually makes us\nacquainted with other concrete facts _in infinitum_.  For, in the first\nplace, the end may be an absolute one.  The _matter_ of the universe,\nfor instance, is according to all appearances in finite amount; and if\nwe knew that we had counted the last bit of it, infinite knowledge in\nthat respect, so far from being given, would be impossible.  With\nregard to _space_, it is true that in drawing a bound we are aware of\nmore.  But to treat this little fringe as the equal of infinite space\nis ridiculous.  It resembles infinite space _secundum quid_, or in but\none respect,--its spatial quality.  We believe it homogeneous with\nwhatever spaces may remain; but it would be fatuous to say, because one\ndollar in my pocket is homogeneous with all the dollars in the country,\nthat to have it is to have them.  The further points of space are as\nnumerically distinct from the fringe as the dollars from the dollar,\nand not until we have actually intuited them can we be said to 'know'\nthem _simpliciter_.  The hegelian reply is that the _quality_ of space\nconstitutes its only _worth_; and that there is nothing true, good, or\nbeautiful to be known {285} in the spaces beyond which is not already\nknown in the fringe.  This introduction of a eulogistic term into a\nmathematical question is original.  The 'true' and the 'false' infinite\nare about as appropriate distinctions in a discussion of cognition as\nthe good and the naughty rain would be in a treatise on meteorology.\nBut when we grant that all the worth of the knowledge of distant spaces\nis due to the knowledge of what they may carry in them, it then appears\nmore than ever absurd to say that the knowledge of the fringe is an\nequivalent for the infinitude of the distant knowledge.  The distant\nspaces even _simpliciter_ are not yet yielded to our thinking; and if\nthey were yielded _simpliciter_, would not be yielded _secundum aliud_,\nor in respect to their material filling out.\nShylock's bond was an omnipotent instrument compared with this\nknowledge of the finite, which remains the ignorance it always was,\ntill the infinite by its own act has piece by piece placed itself in\nour hands.\nHere Hegelism cries out: \"By the identity of the knowledges of infinite\nand finite I never meant that one could be a _substitute_ for the\nother; nor does true philosophy ever mean by identity capacity for\nsubstitution.\"  This sounds suspiciously like the good and the naughty\ninfinite, or rather like the mysteries of the Trinity and the\nEucharist.  To the unsentimental mind there are but two sorts of\nidentity,--total identity and partial identity.  Where the identity is\ntotal, the things can be substituted wholly for one another.  Where\nsubstitution is impossible, it must be that the identity is incomplete.\nIt is the duty of the student then to ascertain the exact _quid,\nsecundum_ which it obtains, as we have tried to do above.  Even the\nCatholic will tell you that when he believes in the {286} identity of\nthe wafer with Christ's body, he does not mean in all respects,--so\nthat he might use it to exhibit muscular fibre, or a cook make it smell\nlike baked meat in the oven.  He means that in the one sole respect of\nnourishing his being in a certain way, it is identical with and can be\nsubstituted for the very body of his Redeemer.\n'The knowledge of opposites is one,' is one of the hegelian first\nprinciples, of which the preceding are perhaps only derivatives.  Here\nagain Hegelism takes 'knowledge' _simpliciter_, and substituting it for\nknowledge in a particular respect, avails itself of the confusion to\ncover other respects never originally implied.  When the knowledge of a\nthing is given us, we no doubt think that the thing may or must have an\nopposite.  This postulate of something opposite we may call a\n'knowledge of the opposite' if we like; but it is a knowledge of it in\nonly that one single respect, that it is something opposite.  No number\nof opposites to a quality we have never directly experienced could ever\nlead us positively to infer what that quality is.  There is a jolt\nbetween the negation of them and the actual positing of it in its\nproper shape, that twenty logics of Hegel harnessed abreast cannot\ndrive us smoothly over.\nThe use of the maxim 'All determination is negation' is the fattest and\nmost full-blown application of the method of refusing to distinguish.\nTaken in its vague confusion, it probably does more than anything else\nto produce the sort of flicker and dazzle which are the first mental\nconditions for the reception of Hegel's system.  The word 'negation'\ntaken _simpliciter_ is treated as if it covered an indefinite number of\n{287} _secundums_, culminating in the very peculiar one of\nself-negation.  Whence finally the conclusion is drawn that assertions\nare universally self-contradictory.  As this is an important matter, it\nseems worth while to treat it a little minutely.\nWhen I measure out a pint, say of milk, and so determine it, what do I\ndo?  I virtually make two assertions regarding it,--it is this pint; it\nis not those other gallons.  One of these is an affirmation, the other\na negation.  Both have a common subject; but the predicates being\nmutually exclusive, the two assertions lie beside each other in endless\npeace.\nI may with propriety be said to make assertions more remote\nstill,--assertions of which those other gallons are the subject.  As it\nis not they, so are they not the pint which it is.  The determination\n\"this is the pint\" carries with it the negation,--\"those are not the\npints.\"  Here we have the same predicate; but the subjects are\nexclusive of each other, so there is again endless peace.  In both\ncouples of propositions negation and affirmation are _secundum aliud_:\nthis is _a_; this is n't not-_a_.  This kind of negation involved in\ndetermination cannot possibly be what Hegel wants for his purposes.\nThe table is not the chair, the fireplace is not the cupboard,--these\nare literal expressions of the law of identity and contradiction, those\nprinciples of the abstracting and separating understanding for which\nHegel has so sovereign a contempt, and which his logic is meant to\nsupersede.\nAnd accordingly Hegelians pursue the subject further, saying there is\nin every determination an element of real conflict.  Do you not in\ndetermining the milk to be this pint exclude it forever from the chance\nof being those gallons, frustrate it from {288} expansion?  And so do\nyou not equally exclude them from the being which it now maintains as\nits own?\nAssuredly if you had been hearing of a land flowing with milk and\nhoney, and had gone there with unlimited expectations of the rivers the\nmilk would fill; and if you found there was but this single pint in the\nwhole country,--the determination of the pint would exclude another\ndetermination which your mind had previously made of the milk.  There\nwould be a real conflict resulting in the victory of one side.  The\nrivers would be negated by the single pint being affirmed; and as\nrivers and pint are affirmed of the same milk (first as supposed and\nthen as found), the contradiction would be complete.\nBut it is a contradiction that can never by any chance occur in real\nnature or being.  It can only occur between a false representation of a\nbeing and the true idea of the being when actually cognized.  The first\ngot into a place where it had no rights and had to be ousted.  But in\n_rerum natur\u00e2_ things do not get into one another's logical places.\nThe gallons first spoken of never say, \"We are the pint;\" the pint\nnever says, \"I am the gallons.\"  It never tries to expand; and so there\nis no chance for anything to exclude or negate it.  It thus remains\naffirmed absolutely.\nCan it be believed in the teeth of these elementary truths that the\nprinciple _determinatio negatio_ is held throughout Hegel to imply an\nactive contradiction, conflict, and exclusion?  Do the horse-cars\njingling outside negate me writing in this room?  Do I, reader, negate\nyou?  Of course, if I say, \"Reader, we are two, and therefore I am\ntwo,\" I negate you, for I am actually thrusting a part into the seat of\nthe whole.  {289} The orthodox logic expresses the fallacy by saying\nthe we is taken by me distributively instead of collectively; but as\nlong as I do not make this blunder, and am content with my part, we all\nare safe.  In _rerum natur\u00e2_, parts remain parts.  Can you imagine one\nposition in space trying to get into the place of another position and\nhaving to be 'contradicted' by that other?  Can you imagine your\nthought of an object trying to dispossess the real object from its\nbeing, and so being negated by it?  The great, the sacred law of\npartaking, the noiseless step of continuity, seems something that Hegel\ncannot possibly understand.  All or nothing is his one idea.  For him\neach point of space, of time, each feeling in the ego, each quality of\nbeing, is clamoring, \"I am the all,--there is nought else but me.\"\nThis clamor is its essence, which has to be negated in another act\nwhich gives it its true determination.  What there is of affirmative in\nthis determination is thus the mere residuum left from the negation by\nothers of the negation it originally applied to them.\nBut why talk of residuum?  The Kilkenny cats of fable could leave a\nresiduum in the shape of their undevoured tails.  But the Kilkenny cats\nof existence as it appears in the pages of Hegel are all-devouring, and\nleave no residuum.  Such is the unexampled fury of their onslaught that\nthey get clean out of themselves and into each other, nay more, pass\nright through each other, and then \"return into themselves\" ready for\nanother round, as insatiate, but as inconclusive, as the one that went\nbefore.\nIf I characterized Hegel's own mood as _hubris_, the insolence of\nexcess, what shall I say of the mood he ascribes to being?  Man makes\nthe gods in his {290} image; and Hegel, in daring to insult the\nspotless _s\u00f4phrosune_ of space and time, the bound-respecters, in\nbranding as strife that law of sharing under whose sacred keeping, like\na strain of music, like an odor of incense (as Emerson says), the dance\nof the atoms goes forward still, seems to me but to manifest his own\ndeformity.\nThis leads me to animadvert on an erroneous inference which hegelian\nidealism makes from the form of the negative judgment.  Every negation,\nit says, must be an intellectual act.  Even the most _na\u00eff_ realism\nwill hardly pretend that the non-table as such exists _in se_ after the\nsame fashion as the table does.  But table and non-table, since they\nare given to our thought together, must be consubstantial.  Try to make\nthe position or affirmation of the table as simple as you can, it is\nalso the negation of the non-table; and thus positive being itself\nseems after all but a function of intelligence, like negation.\nIdealism is proved, realism is unthinkable.  Now I have not myself the\nleast objection to idealism,--an hypothesis which voluminous\nconsiderations make plausible, and whose difficulties may be cleared\naway any day by new discriminations or discoveries.  But I object to\nproving by these patent ready-made _\u00e0 priori_ methods that which can\nonly be the fruit of a wide and patient induction.  For the truth is\nthat our affirmations and negations do not stand on the same footing at\nall, and are anything but consubstantial.  An affirmation says\nsomething about an objective existence.  A negation says something\n_about an affirmation_,--namely, that it is false.  There are no\nnegative predicates or falsities in nature.  Being makes no false\nhypotheses that have {291} to be contradicted.  The only denials she\ncan be in any way construed to perform are denials of our errors.  This\nshows plainly enough that denial must be of something mental, since the\nthing denied is always a fiction.  \"The table is not the chair\"\nsupposes the speaker to have been playing with the false notion that it\nmay have been the chair.  But affirmation may perfectly well be of\nsomething having no such necessary and constitutive relation to\nthought.  Whether it really is of such a thing is for harder\nconsiderations to decide.\nIf idealism be true, the great question that presents itself is whether\nits truth involve the necessity of an infinite, unitary, and omniscient\nconsciousness, or whether a republic of semi-detached consciousnesses\nwill do,--consciousnesses united by a certain common fund of\nrepresentations, but each possessing a private store which the others\ndo not share.  Either hypothesis is to me conceivable.  But whether the\negos be one or many, the _nextness_ of representations to one another\nwithin them is the principle of unification of the universe.  To be\nthus consciously next to some other representation is the condition to\nwhich each representation must submit, under penalty of being excluded\nfrom this universe, and like Lord Dundreary's bird 'flocking all\nalone,' and forming a separate universe by itself.  But this is only a\ncondition of which the representations _partake_; it leaves all their\nother determinations undecided.  To say, because representation _b_\ncannot be in the same universe with _a_ without being _a's neighbor_;\nthat therefore _a_ possesses, involves, or necessitates _b_, hide and\nhair, flesh and fell, all appurtenances and belongings,--is {292} only\nthe silly hegelian all-or-nothing insatiateness once more.\nHegel's own logic, with all the senseless hocus-pocus of its triads,\nutterly fails to prove his position.  The only evident compulsion which\nrepresentations exert upon one another is compulsion to submit to the\nconditions of entrance into the same universe with them--the conditions\nof continuity, of selfhood, space, and time--under penalty of being\nexcluded.  But what this universe shall be is a matter of fact which we\ncannot decide till we know what representations _have_ submitted to\nthese its sole conditions.  The conditions themselves impose no further\nrequirements.  In short, the notion that real contingency and ambiguity\nmay be features of the real world is a perfectly unimpeachable\nhypothesis.  Only in such a world can moral judgments have a claim to\nbe.  For the bad is that which takes the place of something else which\npossibly might have been where it now is, and the better is that which\nabsolutely might be where it absolutely is not.  In the universe of\nHegel--the absolute block whose parts have no loose play, the pure\nplethora of necessary being with the oxygen of possibility all\nsuffocated out of its lungs--there can be neither good nor bad, but one\ndead level of mere fate.\nBut I have tired the reader out.  The worst of criticising Hegel is\nthat the very arguments we use against him give forth strange and\nhollow sounds that make them seem almost as fantastic as the errors to\nwhich they are addressed.  The sense of a universal mirage, of a\nghostly unreality, steals over us, which is the very moonlit atmosphere\nof Hegelism itself.  What wonder then if, instead of {293} converting,\nour words do but rejoice and delight, those already baptized in the\nfaith of confusion?  To their charmed senses we all seem children of\nHegel together, only some of us have not the wit to know our own\nfather.  Just as Romanists are sure to inform us that our reasons\nagainst Papal Christianity unconsciously breathe the purest spirit of\nCatholicism, so Hegelism benignantly smiles at our exertions, and\nmurmurs, \"If the red slayer think he slays;\" \"When me they fly, I am\nthe wings,\" etc.\nTo forefend this unwelcome adoption, let me recapitulate in a few\npropositions the reasons why I am not an hegelian.\n1. We cannot eat our cake and have it; that is, the only real\ncontradiction there can be between thoughts is where one is true, the\nother false.  When this happens, one must go forever; nor is there any\n'higher synthesis' in which both can wholly revive.\n2. A chasm is not a bridge in any utilizable sense; that is, no mere\nnegation can be the instrument of a positive advance in thought.\n3. The continua, time, space, and the ego, are bridges, because they\nare without chasm.\n4. But they bridge over the chasms between represented qualities only\npartially.\n5. This partial bridging, however, makes the qualities share in a\ncommon world.\n6. The other characteristics of the qualities are separate facts.\n7. But the same quality appears in many times and spaces.  Generic\nsameness of the quality wherever found becomes thus a further means by\nwhich the jolts are reduced.\n8. What between different qualities jolts remain.  {294} Each, as far\nas the other is concerned, is an absolutely separate and contingent\nbeing.\n9. The moral judgment may lead us to postulate as irreducible the\ncontingencies of the world.\n10. Elements mutually contingent are not in conflict so long as they\npartake of the continua of time, space, etc.,--partaking being the\nexact opposite of strife.  They conflict only when, as mutually\nexclusive possibilities, they strive to possess themselves of the same\nparts of time, space, and ego.\n11. That there are such real conflicts, irreducible to any\nintelligence, and giving rise to an excess of possibility over\nactuality, is an hypothesis, but a credible one.  No philosophy should\npretend to be anything more.\nNOTE.--Since the preceding article was written, some observations on\nthe effects of nitrous-oxide-gas-intoxication which I was prompted to\nmake by reading the pamphlet called The Anaesthetic Revelation and the\nGist of Philosophy, by Benjamin Paul Blood, Amsterdam, N. Y., 1874,\nhave made me understand better than ever before both the strength and\nthe weakness of Hegel's philosophy.  I strongly urge others to repeat\nthe experiment, which with pure gas is short and harmless enough.  The\neffects will of course vary with the individual.  Just as they vary in\nthe same individual from time to time; but it is probable that in the\nformer case, as in the latter, a generic resemblance will obtain.  With\nme, as with every other person of whom I have heard, the keynote of the\nexperience is the tremendously exciting sense of an intense\nmetaphysical illumination.  Truth lies open to the view in depth\nbeneath depth of almost blinding evidence.  The mind sees all the\nlogical relations of being with an apparent subtlety and instantaneity\nto which its normal consciousness offers no parallel; only as sobriety\nreturns, the feeling of insight fades, and one is left staring vacantly\nat a few disjointed words and phrases, as one stares at a\ncadaverous-looking snow-peak from which the sunset glow has just fled,\nor at the black cinder left by an extinguished brand.\n{295}\nThe immense emotional sense of _reconciliation_ which characterizes the\n'maudlin' stage of alcoholic drunkenness,--a stage which seems silly to\nlookers-on, but the subjective rapture of which probably constitutes a\nchief part of the temptation to the vice,--is well known.  The centre\nand periphery of things seem to come together.  The ego and its\nobjects, the _meum_ and the _tuum_, are one.  Now this, only a\nthousandfold enhanced, was the effect upon me of the gas: and its first\nresult was to make peal through me with unutterable power the\nconviction that Hegelism was true after all, and that the deepest\nconvictions of my intellect hitherto were wrong.  Whatever idea or\nrepresentation occurred to the mind was seized by the same logical\nforceps, and served to illustrate the same truth; and that truth was\nthat every opposition, among whatsoever things, vanishes in a higher\nunity in which it is based; that all contradictions, so-called, are but\ndifferences; that all differences are of degree; that all degrees are\nof a common kind; that unbroken continuity is of the essence of being;\nand that we are literally in the midst of _an infinite_, to perceive\nthe existence of which is the utmost we can attain.  Without the _same_\nas a basis, how could strife occur?  Strife presupposes something to be\nstriven about; and in this common topic, the same for both parties, the\ndifferences merge.  From the hardest contradiction to the tenderest\ndiversity of verbiage differences evaporate; _yes_ and _no_ agree at\nleast in being assertions; a denial of a statement is but another mode\nof stating the same, contradiction can only occur of the same\nthing,--all opinions are thus synonyms, are synonymous, are the same.\nBut the same phrase by difference of emphasis is two; and here again\ndifference and no-difference merge in one.\nIt is impossible to convey an idea of the torrential character of the\nidentification of opposites as it streams through the mind in this\nexperience.  I have sheet after sheet of phrases dictated or written\nduring the intoxication, which to the sober reader seem meaningless\ndrivel, but which at the moment of transcribing were fused in the fire\nof infinite rationality.  God and devil, good and evil, life and death,\nI and thou, sober and drunk, matter and form, black and white, quantity\nand quality, shiver of ecstasy and shudder of horror, vomiting and\nswallowing, inspiration and expiration, fate and reason, great and\nsmall, extent and intent, joke and earnest, tragic and comic, and fifty\nother {296} contrasts figure in these pages in the same monotonous way.\nThe mind saw how each term _belonged_ to its contrast through a\nknife-edge moment of transition which _it_ effected, and which,\nperennial and eternal, was the _nunc stans_ of life.  The thought of\nmutual implication of the parts in the bare form of a judgment of\nopposition, as 'nothing--but,' 'no more--than,' 'only--if,' etc.,\nproduced a perfect delirium of theoretic rapture.  And at last, when\ndefinite ideas to work on came slowly, the mind went through the mere\n_form_ of recognizing sameness in identity by contrasting the same word\nwith itself, differently emphasized, or shorn of its initial letter.\nLet me transcribe a few sentences:\nWhat's mistake but a kind of take?\nWhat's nausea but a kind of -ausea?\nSober, drunk, -_unk_, astonishment.\nEverything can become the subject of criticism--how\ncriticise without something _to_ criticise?\nAgreement--disagreement!!\nEmotion--motion!!!\nDie away from, _from_, die away (without the _from_).\nReconciliation of opposites; sober, drunk, all the same!\nGood and evil reconciled in a laugh!\nIt escapes, it escapes!\nBut----\nWhat escapes, WHAT escapes?\nEmphasis, EMphasis; there must be some emphasis in order\nfor there to be a phasis.\nNo verbiage can give it, because the verbiage is _other_.\n_In_coherent, coherent--same.\nAnd it fades!  And it's infinite!  AND it's infinite!\nIf it was n't _going_, why should you hold on to it?\nDon't you see the difference, don't you see the identity?\nConstantly opposites united!\nThe same me telling you to write and not to write!\nExtreme--extreme, extreme!  Within the _ex_tensity that\n'extreme' contains is contained the '_extreme_' of intensity.\nSomething, and _other_ than that thing!\nIntoxication, and _otherness_ than intoxication.\nEvery attempt at betterment,--every attempt at otherment,--is a----.\nIt fades forever and forever as we move.\n{297}\nThere _is_ a reconciliation!\nReconciliation--_e_conciliation!\nBy God, how that hurts!  By God, how it _does n't_ hurt!\nReconciliation of two extremes.\nBy George, nothing but _o_thing!\nThat sounds like nonsense, but it is pure _on_sense!\nThought deeper than speech----!\nMedical school; divinity school, _school_!  SCHOOL!  Oh my\nGod, oh God, oh God!\nThe most coherent and articulate sentence which came was this:--\nThere are no differences but differences of degree between different\ndegrees of difference and no difference.\nThis phrase has the true Hegelian ring, being in fact a regular _sich\nals sich auf sich selbst beziehende Negativit\u00e4t_.  And true Hegelians\nwill _\u00fcberhaupt_ be able to read between the lines and feel, at any\nrate, what _possible_ ecstasies of cognitive emotion might have bathed\nthese tattered fragments of thought when they were alive.  But for the\nassurance of a certain amount of respect from them, I should hardly\nhave ventured to print what must be such caviare to the general.\nBut now comes the reverse of the medal.  What is the principle of unity\nin all this monotonous rain of instances?  Although I did not see it at\nfirst, I soon found that it was in each case nothing but the abstract\n_genus_ of which the conflicting terms were opposite species.  In other\nwords, although the flood of ontologic _emotion_ was Hegelian through\nand through, the _ground_ for it was nothing but the world-old\nprinciple that things are the same only so far and no farther than they\n_are_ the same, or partake of a common nature,--the principle that\nHegel most tramples under foot.  At the same time the rapture of\nbeholding a process that was infinite, changed (as the nature of the\ninfinitude was realized by the mind) into the sense of a dreadful and\nineluctable fate, with whose magnitude every finite effort is\nincommensurable and in the light of which whatever happens is\nindifferent.  This instantaneous revulsion of mood from rapture to\nhorror is, perhaps, the strongest emotion I have ever experienced.  I\ngot it repeatedly when the inhalation was continued long enough to\nproduce incipient nausea; and I cannot but regard it as the normal and\ninevitable outcome of the {298} intoxication, if sufficiently\nprolonged.  A pessimistic fatalism, depth within depth of impotence and\nindifference, reason and silliness united, not in a higher synthesis,\nbut in the fact that whichever you choose it is all one,--this is the\nupshot of a revelation that began so rosy bright.\nEven when the process stops short of this ultimatum, the reader will\nhave noticed from the phrases quoted how often it ends by losing the\nclue.  Something 'fades,' 'escapes;' and the feeling of insight is\nchanged into an intense one of bewilderment, puzzle, confusion,\nastonishment.  I know no more singular sensation than this intense\nbewilderment, with nothing particular left to be bewildered at save the\nbewilderment itself.  It seems, indeed, _a causa sui_, or 'spirit\nbecome its own object.'\nMy conclusion is that the togetherness of things in a common world, the\nlaw of sharing, of which I have said so much, may, when perceived,\nengender a very powerful emotion, that Hegel was so unusually\nsusceptible to this emotion throughout his life that its gratification\nbecame his supreme end, and made him tolerably unscrupulous as to the\nmeans he employed; that _indifferentism_ is the true outcome of every\nview of the world which makes infinity and continuity to be its\nessence, and that pessimistic or optimistic attitudes pertain to the\nmere accidental subjectivity of the moment; finally, that the\nidentification of contradictories, so far from being the\nself-developing process which Hegel supposes, is really a\nself-consuming process, passing from the less to the more abstract, and\nterminating either in a laugh at the ultimate nothingness, or in a mood\nof vertiginous amazement at a meaningless infinity.\n[1] Reprinted from Mind, April, 1882.\n[2] The seeming contradiction between the infinitude of space and the\nfact that it is all finished and given and there, can be got over in\nmore than one way.  The simplest way is by idealism, which\ndistinguishes between space as actual and space as potential.  For\nidealism, space only exists so far as it is represented; but all\nactually represented spaces are finite; it is only possibly\nrepresentable spaces that are infinite.\n[3] Not only for simplicity's sake do we select space as the paragon of\na rationalizing continuum.  Space determines the relations of the items\nthat enter it in a far more intricate way than does time; in a far more\nfixed way than does the ego.  By this last clause I mean that if things\nare in space at all, they must conform to geometry; while the being in\nan ego at all need not make them conform to logic or any other manner\nof rationality.  Under the sheltering wings of a self the matter of\nunreason can lodge itself as safely as any other kind of content.  One\ncannot but respect the devoutness of the ego-worship of some of our\nEnglish-writing Hegelians.  But at the same time one cannot help\nfearing lest the monotonous contemplation of so barren a principle as\nthat of the pure formal self (which, be it never so essential a\ncondition of the existence of a world of organized experience at all,\nmust notwithstanding take its own _character_ from, not give the\ncharacter to, the separate empirical data over which its mantle is\ncast), one cannot but fear, I say, lest the religion of the\ntranscendental ego should, like all religions of the 'one thing\nneedful,' end by sterilizing and occluding the minds of its believers.\n[4] Journal of Speculative Philosophy, viii. 37.\n{299}\nWHAT PSYCHICAL RESEARCH HAS ACCOMPLISHED.[1]\n\"The great field for new discoveries,\" said a scientific friend to me\nthe other day, \"is always the unclassified residuum.\"  Round about the\naccredited and orderly facts of every science there ever floats a sort\nof dust-cloud of exceptional observations, of occurrences minute and\nirregular and seldom met with, which it always proves more easy to\nignore than to attend to.  The ideal of every science is that of a\nclosed and completed system of truth.  The charm of most sciences to\ntheir more passive disciples consists in their appearing, in fact, to\nwear just this ideal form.  Each one of our various _ologies_ seems to\noffer a definite head of classification for every possible phenomenon\nof the sort which it professes to cover; and so far from free is most\nmen's fancy, that, when a consistent and organized scheme of this sort\nhas once been comprehended and assimilated, a different scheme is\nunimaginable.  No alternative, whether to whole or parts, can any\nlonger be conceived as possible.  Phenomena unclassifiable within the\nsystem are therefore paradoxical {300} absurdities, and must be held\nuntrue.  When, moreover, as so often happens, the reports of them are\nvague and indirect; when they come as mere marvels and oddities rather\nthan as things of serious moment,--one neglects or denies them with the\nbest of scientific consciences.  Only the born geniuses let themselves\nbe worried and fascinated by these outstanding exceptions, and get no\npeace till they are brought within the fold.  Your Galileos, Galvanis,\nFresnels, Purkinjes, and Darwins are always getting confounded and\ntroubled by insignificant things.  Any one will renovate his science\nwho will steadily look after the irregular phenomena.  And when the\nscience is renewed, its new formulas often have more of the voice of\nthe exceptions in them than of what were supposed to be the rules.\nNo part of the unclassified residuum has usually been treated with a\nmore contemptuous scientific disregard than the mass of phenomena\ngenerally called _mystical_.  Physiology will have nothing to do with\nthem.  Orthodox psychology turns its back upon them.  Medicine sweeps\nthem out; or, at most, when in an anecdotal vein, records a few of them\nas 'effects of the imagination,'--a phrase of mere dismissal, whose\nmeaning, in this connection, it is impossible to make precise.  All the\nwhile, however, the phenomena are there, lying broadcast over the\nsurface of history.  No matter where you open its pages, you find\nthings recorded under the name of divinations, inspirations, demoniacal\npossessions, apparitions, trances, ecstasies, miraculous healings and\nproductions of disease, and occult powers possessed by peculiar\nindividuals over persons and things in their neighborhood.  We suppose\nthat 'mediumship' {301} originated in Rochester, N. Y., and animal\nmagnetism with Mesmer; but once look behind the pages of official\nhistory, in personal memoirs, legal documents, and popular narratives\nand books of anecdote, and you will find that there never was a time\nwhen these things were not reported just as abundantly as now.  We\ncollege-bred gentry, who follow the stream of cosmopolitan culture\nexclusively, not infrequently stumble upon some old-established\njournal, or some voluminous native author, whose names are never heard\nof in _our_ circle, but who number their readers by the\nquarter-million.  It always gives us a little shock to find this mass\nof human beings not only living and ignoring us and all our gods, but\nactually reading and writing and cogitating without ever a thought of\nour canons and authorities.  Well, a public no less large keeps and\ntransmits from generation to generation the traditions and practices of\nthe occult; but academic science cares as little for its beliefs and\nopinions as you, gentle reader, care for those of the readers of the\nWaverley and the Fireside Companion.  To no one type of mind is it\ngiven to discern the totality of truth.  Something escapes the best of\nus,--not accidentally, but systematically, and because we have a twist.\nThe scientific-academic mind and the feminine-mystical mind shy from\neach other's facts, just as they fly from each other's temper and\nspirit.  Facts are there only for those who have a mental affinity with\nthem.  When once they are indisputably ascertained and admitted, the\nacademic and critical minds are by far the best fitted ones to\ninterpret and discuss them,--for surely to pass from mystical to\nscientific speculations is like passing from lunacy to sanity; but on\nthe other hand if there is {302} anything which human history\ndemonstrates, it is the extreme slowness with which the ordinary\nacademic and critical mind acknowledges facts to exist which present\nthemselves as wild facts, with no stall or pigeon-hole, or as facts\nwhich threaten to break up the accepted system.  In psychology,\nphysiology, and medicine, wherever a debate between the mystics and the\nscientifics has been once for all decided, it is the mystics who have\nusually proved to be right about the _facts_, while the scientifics had\nthe better of it in respect to the theories.  The most recent and\nflagrant example of this is 'animal magnetism,' whose facts were\nstoutly dismissed as a pack of lies by academic medical science the\nworld over, until the non-mystical theory of 'hypnotic suggestion' was\nfound for them,--when they were admitted to be so excessively and\ndangerously common that special penal laws, forsooth, must be passed to\nkeep all persons unequipped with medical diplomas from taking part in\ntheir production.  Just so stigmatizations, invulnerabilities,\ninstantaneous cures, inspired discourses, and demoniacal possessions,\nthe records of which were shelved in our libraries but yesterday in the\nalcove headed 'superstitions,' now, under the brand-new title of 'cases\nof hystero-epilepsy,' are republished, reobserved, and reported with an\neven too credulous avidity.\nRepugnant as the mystical style of philosophizing maybe (especially\nwhen self-complacent), there is no sort of doubt that it goes with a\ngift for meeting with certain kinds of phenomenal experience.  The\nwriter of these pages has been forced in the past few years to this\nadmission; and he now believes that he who will pay attention to facts\nof the sort dear to mystics, {303} while reflecting upon them in\nacademic-scientific ways, will be in the best possible position to help\nphilosophy.  It is a circumstance of good augury that certain\nscientifically trained minds in all countries seem drifting to the same\nconclusion.  The Society for Psychical Research has been one means of\nbringing science and the occult together in England and America; and\nbelieving that this Society fulfils a function which, though limited,\nis destined to be not unimportant in the organization of human\nknowledge, I am glad to give a brief account of it to the uninstructed\nreader.\nAccording to the newspaper and drawing-room myth, soft-headedness and\nidiotic credulity are the bond of sympathy in this Society, and general\nwonder-sickness its dynamic principle.  A glance at the membership\nfails, however, to corroborate this view.  The president is Prof. Henry\nSidgwick,[2] known by his other deeds as the most incorrigibly and\nexasperatingly critical and sceptical mind in England.  The hard-headed\nArthur Balfour is one vice-president, and the hard-headed Prof. J. P.\nLangley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, is another.  Such\nmen as Professor Lodge, the eminent English physicist, and Professor\nRichet, the eminent French physiologist, are among the most active\ncontributors to the Society's Proceedings; and through the catalogue of\nmembership are sprinkled names honored throughout the world for their\nscientific capacity.  In fact, were I asked to point to a scientific\njournal where hard-headedness and never-sleeping suspicion of sources\nof error might be seen in their full bloom, {304} I think I should have\nto fall back on the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research.\nThe common run of papers, say on physiological subjects, which one\nfinds in other professional organs, are apt to show a far lower level\nof critical consciousness.  Indeed, the rigorous canons of evidence\napplied a few years ago to testimony in the case of certain 'mediums'\nled to the secession from the Society of a number of spiritualists.\nMessrs. Stainton Moses and A. R. Wallace, among others, thought that no\nexperiences based on mere eyesight could ever have a chance to be\nadmitted as true, if such an impossibly exacting standard of proof were\ninsisted on in every case.\nThe S. P. R., as I shall call it for convenience, was founded in 1882\nby a number of gentlemen, foremost among whom seem to have been\nProfessors Sidgwick, W. F. Barrett, and Balfour Stewart, and Messrs. R.\nH. Hutton, Hensleigh Wedgwood, Edmund Gurney, and F. W. H. Myers.\nTheir purpose was twofold,--first, to carry on systematic\nexperimentation with hypnotic subjects, mediums, clairvoyants, and\nothers; and, secondly, to collect evidence concerning apparitions,\nhaunted houses, and similar phenomena which are incidentally reported,\nbut which, from their fugitive character, admit of no deliberate\ncontrol.  Professor Sidgwick, in his introductory address, insisted\nthat the divided state of public opinion on all these matters was a\nscandal to science,--absolute disdain on _\u00e0 priori_ grounds\ncharacterizing what may be called professional opinion, while\nindiscriminate credulity was too often found among those who pretended\nto have a first-hand acquaintance with the facts.\nAs a sort of weather bureau for accumulating {305} reports of such\nmeteoric phenomena as apparitions, the S. P. R. has done an immense\namount of work.  As an experimenting body, it cannot be said to have\ncompletely fulfilled the hopes of its founders.  The reasons for this\nlie in two circumstances: first, the clairvoyant and other subjects who\nwill allow themselves to be experimented upon are few and far between;\nand, secondly, work with them takes an immense amount of time, and has\nhad to be carried on at odd intervals by members engaged in other\npursuits.  The Society has not yet been rich enough to control the\nundivided services of skilled experimenters in this difficult field.\nThe loss of the lamented Edmund Gurney, who more than any one else had\nleisure to devote, has been so far irreparable.  But were there no\nexperimental work at all, and were the S. P. R. nothing but a\nweather-bureau for catching sporadic apparitions, etc., in their\nfreshness, I am disposed to think its function indispensable in the\nscientific organism.  If any one of my readers, spurred by the thought\nthat so much smoke must needs betoken fire, has ever looked into the\nexisting literature of the supernatural for proof, he will know what I\nmean.  This literature is enormous, but it is practically worthless for\nevidential purposes.  Facts enough are cited, indeed; but the records\nof them are so fallible and imperfect that at most they lead to the\nopinion that it may be well to keep a window open upon that quarter in\none's mind.\nIn the S. P. R.'s Proceedings, on the contrary, a different law\nprevails.  Quality, and not mere quantity, is what has been mainly kept\nin mind.  The witnesses, where possible, have in every reported case\nbeen cross-examined personally, the collateral facts {306} have been\nlooked up, and the story appears with its precise coefficient of\nevidential worth stamped on it, so that all may know just what its\nweight as proof may be.  Outside of these Proceedings, I know of no\nsystematic attempt to _weigh_ the evidence for the supernatural.  This\nmakes the value of the volumes already published unique; and I firmly\nbelieve that as the years go on and the ground covered grows still\nwider, the Proceedings will more and more tend to supersede all other\nsources of information concerning phenomena traditionally deemed\noccult.  Collections of this sort are usually best appreciated by the\nrising generation.  The young anthropologists and psychologists who\nwill soon have full occupancy of the stage will feel how great a\nscientific scandal it has been to leave a great mass of human\nexperience to take its chances between vague tradition and credulity on\nthe one hand and dogmatic denial at long range on the other, with no\nbody of persons extant who are willing and competent to study the\nmatter with both patience and rigor.  If the Society lives long enough\nfor the public to become familiar with its presence, so that any\napparition, or house or person infested with unaccountable noises or\ndisturbances of material objects, will as a matter of course be\nreported to its officers, we shall doubtless end by having a mass of\nfacts concrete enough to theorize upon.  Its sustainers, therefore,\nshould accustom themselves to the idea that its first duty is simply to\nexist from year to year and perform this recording function well,\nthough no conclusive results of any sort emerge at first.  All our\nlearned societies have begun in some such modest way.\nBut one cannot by mere outward organization make much progress in\nmatters scientific.  Societies can {307} back men of genius, but can\nnever take their place.  The contrast between the parent Society and\nthe American Branch illustrates this.  In England, a little group of\nmen with enthusiasm and genius for the work supplied the nucleus; in\nthis country, Mr. Hodgson had to be imported from Europe before any\ntangible progress was made.  What perhaps more than anything else has\nheld the Society together in England is Professor Sidgwick's\nextraordinary gift of inspiring confidence in diverse sorts of people.\nSuch tenacity of interest in the result and such absolute impartiality\nin discussing the evidence are not once in a century found in an\nindividual.  His obstinate belief that there is something yet to be\nbrought to light communicates patience to the discouraged; his\nconstitutional inability to draw any precipitate conclusion reassures\nthose who are afraid of being dupes.  Mrs. Sidgwick--a sister, by the\nway, of the great Arthur Balfour--is a worthy ally of her husband in\nthis matter, showing a similarly rare power of holding her judgment in\nsuspense, and a keenness of observation and capacity for experimenting\nwith human subjects which are rare in either sex.\nThe _worker_ of the Society, as originally constituted, was Edmund\nGurney.  Gurney was a man of the rarest sympathies and gifts.\nAlthough, like Carlyle, he used to groan under the burden of his\nlabors, he yet exhibited a colossal power of dispatching business and\ngetting through drudgery of the most repulsive kind.  His two thick\nvolumes on 'Phantasms of the Living,' collected and published in three\nyears, are a proof of this.  Besides this, he had exquisite artistic\ninstincts, and his massive volume on 'The Power of Sound' was, when it\nappeared, the most important {308} work on aesthetics in the English\nlanguage.  He had also the tenderest heart and a mind of rare\nmetaphysical power, as his volumes of essays, 'Tertium Quid,' will\nprove to any reader.  Mr. Frederic Myers, already well known as one of\nthe most brilliant of English essayists, is the _ingenium praefervidum_\nof the S. P. R.  Of the value of Mr. Myers's theoretic writings I will\nsay a word later.  Dr. Hodgson, the American secretary, is\ndistinguished by a balance of mind almost as rare in its way as\nSidgwick's.  He is persuaded of the reality of many of the phenomena\ncalled spiritualistic, but he also has uncommon keenness in detecting\nerror; and it is impossible to say in advance whether it will give him\nmore satisfaction to confirm or to smash a given case offered to his\nexamination.\nIt is now time to cast a brief look upon the actual contents of these\nProceedings.  The first two years were largely taken up with\nexperiments in thought-transference.  The earliest lot of these were\nmade with the daughters of a clergyman named Creery, and convinced\nMessrs. Balfour Stewart, Barrett, Myers, and Gurney that the girls had\nan inexplicable power of guessing names and objects thought of by other\npersons.  Two years later, Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. Gurney, recommencing\nexperiments with the same girls, detected them signalling to each\nother.  It is true that for the most part the conditions of the earlier\nseries had excluded signalling, and it is also possible that the\ncheating may have grafted itself on what was originally a genuine\nphenomenon.  Yet Gurney was wise in abandoning the entire series to the\nscepticism of the reader.  Many critics of the S. P. R. seem out of all\n{309} its labors to have heard only of this case.  But there are\nexperiments recorded with upwards of thirty other subjects.  Three were\nexperimented upon at great length during the first two years: one was\nMr. G. A. Smith; the other two were young ladies in Liverpool in the\nemployment of Mr. Malcolm Guthrie.\nIt is the opinion of all who took part in these latter experiments that\nsources of conscious and unconscious deception were sufficiently\nexcluded, and that the large percentage of correct reproductions by the\nsubjects of words, diagrams, and sensations occupying other persons'\nconsciousness were entirely inexplicable as results of chance.  The\nwitnesses of these performances were in fact all so satisfied of the\ngenuineness of the phenomena, that 'telepathy' has figured freely in\nthe papers of the Proceedings and in Gurney's book on Phantasms as a\n_vera causa_ on which additional hypotheses might be built.  No mere\nreader can be blamed, however, if he demand, for so revolutionary a\nbelief, a more overwhelming bulk of testimony than has yet been\nsupplied.  Any day, of course, may bring in fresh experiments in\nsuccessful picture-guessing.  But meanwhile, and lacking that, we can\nonly point out that the present data are strengthened in the flank, so\nto speak, by all observations that tend to corroborate the possibility\nof other kindred phenomena, such as telepathic impression,\nclairvoyance, or what is called 'test-mediumship.'  The wider genus\nwill naturally cover the narrower species with its credit.\nGurney's papers on hypnotism must be mentioned next.  Some of them are\nless concerned with establishing new facts than with analyzing old\nones.  But omitting these, we find that in the line of pure {310}\nobservation Gurney claims to have ascertained in more than one subject\nthe following phenomenon: The subject's hands are thrust through a\nblanket, which screens the operator from his eyes, and his mind is\nabsorbed in conversation with a third person.  The operator meanwhile\npoints with his finger to one of the fingers of the subject, which\nfinger alone responds to this silent selection by becoming stiff or\nanaesthetic, as the case may be.  The interpretation is difficult, but\nthe phenomenon, which I have myself witnessed, seems authentic.\nAnother observation made by Gurney seems to prove the possibility of\nthe subject's mind being directly influenced by the operator's.  The\nhypnotized subject responds, or fails to respond, to questions asked by\na third party according to the operator's silent permission or refusal.\nOf course, in these experiments all obvious sources of deception were\nexcluded.  But Gurney's most important contribution to our knowledge of\nhypnotism was his series of experiments on the automatic writing of\nsubjects who had received post-hypnotic suggestions.  For example, a\nsubject during trance is told that he will poke the fire in six minutes\nafter waking.  On being waked he has no memory of the order, but while\nhe is engaged in conversation his hand is placed on a _planchette_,\nwhich immediately writes the sentence, \"P., you will poke the fire in\nsix minutes.\"  Experiments like this, which were repeated in great\nvariety, seem to prove that below the upper consciousness the hypnotic\nconsciousness persists, engrossed with the suggestion and able to\nexpress itself through the involuntarily moving hand.\nGurney shares, therefore, with Janet and Binet, the {311} credit of\ndemonstrating the simultaneous existence of two different strata of\nconsciousness, ignorant of each other, in the same person.  The\n'extra-consciousness,' as one may call it, can be kept on tap, as it\nwere, by the method of automatic writing.  This discovery marks a new\nera in experimental psychology, and it is impossible to overrate its\nimportance.  But Gurney's greatest piece of work is his laborious\n'Phantasms of the Living.'  As an example of the drudgery stowed away\nin the volumes, it may suffice to say that in looking up the proofs for\nthe alleged physical phenomena of witchcraft, Gurney reports a careful\nsearch through two hundred and sixty books on the subject, with the\nresult of finding no first-hand evidence recorded in the trials except\nthe confessions of the victims themselves; and these, of course, are\npresumptively due to either torture or hallucination.  This statement,\nmade in an unobtrusive note, is only one instance of the care displayed\nthroughout the volumes.  In the course of these, Gurney discusses about\nseven hundred cases of apparitions which he collected.  A large number\nof these were 'veridical,' in the sense of coinciding with some\ncalamity happening to the person who appeared.  Gurney's explanation is\nthat the mind of the person undergoing the calamity was at that moment\nable to impress the mind of the percipient with an hallucination.\nApparitions, on this 'telepathic' theory, may be called 'objective'\nfacts, although they are not 'material' facts.  In order to test the\nlikelihood of such veridical hallucinations being due to mere chance,\nGurney instituted the 'census of hallucinations,' which has been\ncontinued with the result of obtaining answers from over twenty-five\nthousand persons, asked {312} at random in different countries whether,\nwhen in good health and awake, they had ever heard a voice, seen a\nform, or felt a touch which no material presence could account for.\nThe result seems to be, roughly speaking, that in England about one\nadult in ten has had such an experience at least once in his life, and\nthat of the experiences themselves a large number coincide with some\ndistant event.  The question is, Is the frequency of these latter cases\ntoo great to be deemed fortuitous, and must we suppose an occult\nconnection between the two events?  Mr. and Mrs. Sidgwick have worked\nout this problem on the basis of the English returns, seventeen\nthousand in number, with a care and thoroughness that leave nothing to\nbe desired.  Their conclusion is that the cases where the apparition of\na person is seen on the day of his death are four hundred and forty\ntimes too numerous to be ascribed to chance.  The reasoning employed to\ncalculate this number is simple enough.  If there be only a fortuitous\nconnection between the death of an individual and the occurrence of his\napparition to some one at a distance, the death is no more likely to\nfall on the same day as the apparition than it is to occur on the same\nday with any other event in nature.  But the chance-probability that\nany individual's death will fall on any given day marked in advance by\nsome other event is just equal to the chance-probability that the\nindividual will die at all on any specified day; and the national\ndeath-rate gives that probability as one in nineteen thousand.  If,\nthen, when the death of a person coincides with an apparition of the\nsame person, the coincidence be merely fortuitous, it ought not to\noccur oftener than once in nineteen thousand cases.  As a matter of\nfact, {313} however, it does occur (according to the census) once in\nforty-three cases, a number (as aforesaid) four hundred and forty times\ntoo great.  The American census, of some seven thousand answers, gives\na remarkably similar result.  Against this conclusion the only rational\nanswer that I can see is that the data are still too few; that the net\nwas not cast wide enough; and that we need, to get fair averages, far\nmore than twenty-four thousand answers to the census question.  This\nmay, of course, be true, though it seems exceedingly unlikely; and in\nour own twenty-four thousand answers veridical cases may possibly have\nheaped themselves unduly.\nThe next topic worth mentioning in the Proceedings is the discussion of\nthe physical phenomena of mediumship (slate-writing, furniture-moving,\nand so forth) by Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. Hodgson, and 'Mr. Davey.'  This, so\nfar as it goes, is destructive of the claims of all the mediums\nexamined.  'Mr. Davey' himself produced fraudulent slate-writing of the\nhighest order, while Mr. Hodgson, a 'sitter' in his confidence,\nreviewed the written reports of the series of his other sitters,--all\nof them intelligent persons,--and showed that in every case they failed\nto see the essential features of what was done before their eyes.  This\nDavey-Hodgson contribution is probably the most damaging document\nconcerning eye-witnesses' evidence that has ever been produced.\nAnother substantial bit of work based on personal observation is Mr.\nHodgson's report on Madame Blavatsky's claims to physical mediumship.\nThis is adverse to the lady's pretensions; and although some of Madame\nBlavatsky's friends make light of it, it is a stroke from which her\nreputation will not recover.\n{314}\nPhysical mediumship in all its phases has fared hard in the\nProceedings.  The latest case reported on is that of the famous Eusapia\nPaladino, who being detected in fraud at Cambridge, after a brilliant\ncareer of success on the continent, has, according to the draconian\nrules of method which govern the Society, been ruled out from a further\nhearing.  The case of Stainton Moses, on the other hand, concerning\nwhich Mr. Myers has brought out a mass of unpublished testimony, seems\nto escape from the universal condemnation, and appears to force upon us\nwhat Mr. Andrew Lang calls the choice between a moral and a physical\nmiracle.\nIn the case of Mrs. Piper, not a physical but a trance medium, we seem\nto have no choice offered at all.  Mr. Hodgson and others have made\nprolonged study of this lady's trances, and are all convinced that\nsuper-normal powers of cognition are displayed therein.  These are\n_prim\u00e2 facie_ due to 'spirit-control.'  But the conditions are so\ncomplex that a dogmatic decision either for or against the\nspirit-hypothesis must as yet be postponed.\nOne of the most important experimental contributions to the Proceedings\nis the article of Miss X. on 'Crystal Vision.'  Many persons who look\nfixedly into a crystal or other vaguely luminous surface fall into a\nkind of daze, and see visions.  Miss X. has this susceptibility in a\nremarkable degree, and is, moreover, an unusually intelligent critic.\nShe reports many visions which can only be described as apparently\nclairvoyant, and others which beautifully fill a vacant niche incur\nknowledge of subconscious mental operations.  For example, looking into\nthe crystal before breakfast one morning she reads in printed\ncharacters of the {315} death of a lady of her acquaintance, the date\nand other circumstances all duly appearing in type.  Startled by this,\nshe looks at the 'Times' of the previous day for verification, and\nthere among the deaths are the identical words which she has seen.  On\nthe same page of the Times are other items which she remembers reading\nthe day before; and the only explanation seems to be that her eyes then\ninattentively observed, so to speak, the death-item, which forthwith\nfell into a special corner of her memory, and came out as a visual\nhallucination when the peculiar modification of consciousness induced\nby the crystal-gazing set in.\nPassing from papers based on observation to papers based on narrative,\nwe have a number of ghost stories, etc., sifted by Mrs. Sidgwick and\ndiscussed by Messrs. Myers and Podmore.  They form the best ghost\nliterature I know of from the point of view of emotional interest.  As\nto the conclusions drawn, Mrs. Sidgwick is rigorously non-committal,\nwhile Mr. Myers and Mr. Podmore show themselves respectively hospitable\nand inhospitable to the notion that such stories have a basis of\nobjectivity dependent on the continued existence of the dead.\nI must close my gossip about the Proceedings by naming what, after all,\nseems to me the most important part of its contents.  This is the long\nseries of articles by Mr. Myers on what he now calls the 'subliminal\nself,' or what one might designate as ultra-marginal consciousness.\nThe result of Myers's learned and ingenious studies in hypnotism,\nhallucinations, automatic writing, mediumship, and the whole series of\nallied phenomena is a conviction which he expresses in the following\nterms:--\n{316}\n\"Each of us is in reality an abiding psychical entity far more\nextensive than he knows,--an individuality which can never express\nitself completely through any corporeal manifestation.  The self\nmanifests itself through the organism; but there is always some part of\nthe self unmanifested, and always, as it seems, some power of organic\nexpression in abeyance or reserve.\"\nThe ordinary consciousness Mr. Myers likens to the visible part of the\nsolar spectrum; the total consciousness is like that spectrum prolonged\nby the inclusion of the ultra-red and ultra-violet rays.  In the\npsychic spectrum the 'ultra' parts may embrace a far wider range, both\nof physiological and of psychical activity, than is open to our\nordinary consciousness and memory.  At the lower end we have the\n_physiological_ extension, mind-cures, 'stigmatization' of ecstatics,\netc.; in the upper, the hyper-normal cognitions of the medium-trance.\nWhatever the judgment of the future may be on Mr. Myers's speculations,\nthe credit will always remain to them of being the first attempt in any\nlanguage to consider the phenomena of hallucination, hypnotism,\nautomatism, double personality, and mediumship as connected parts of\none whole subject.  All constructions in this field must be\nprovisional, and it is as something provisional that Mr. Myers offers\nus his formulations.  But, thanks to him, we begin to see for the first\ntime what a vast interlocked and graded system these phenomena, from\nthe rudest motor-automatisms to the most startling sensory-apparition,\nform.  Quite apart from Mr. Myers's conclusions, his methodical\ntreatment of them by classes and series is the first great step toward\novercoming the distaste of orthodox science to look at them at all.\n{317}\nOne's reaction on hearsay testimony is always determined by one's own\nexperience.  Most men who have once convinced themselves, by what seems\nto them a careful examination, that any one species of the supernatural\nexists, begin to relax their vigilance as to evidence, and throw the\ndoors of their minds more or less wide open to the supernatural along\nits whole extent.  To a mind that has thus made its _salto mortale_,\nthe minute work over insignificant cases and quiddling discussion of\n'evidential values,' of which the Society's reports are full, seems\ninsufferably tedious.  And it is so; few species of literature are more\ntruly dull than reports of phantasms.  Taken simply by themselves, as\nseparate facts to stare at, they appear so devoid of meaning and sweep,\nthat, even were they certainly true, one would be tempted to leave them\nout of one's universe for being so idiotic.  Every other sort of fact\nhas some context and continuity with the rest of nature.  These alone\nare contextless and discontinuous.\nHence I think that the sort of loathing--no milder word will do--which\nthe very words 'psychical research' and 'psychical researcher' awaken\nin so many honest scientific breasts is not only natural, but in a\nsense praiseworthy.  A man who is unable himself to conceive of any\n_orbit_ for these mental meteors can only suppose that Messrs. Gurney,\nMyers, & Co.'s mood in dealing with them must be that of silly\nmarvelling at so many detached prodigies.  And such prodigies!  So\nscience simply falls back on her general _non-possumus_; and most of\nthe would-be critics of the Proceedings have been contented to oppose\nto the phenomena recorded the simple presumption that in some way or\nother the reports _must_ be {318} fallacious,--for so far as the order\nof nature has been subjected to really scientific scrutiny, it always\nhas been proved to run the other way.  But the oftener one is forced to\nreject an alleged sort of fact by the use of this mere presumption, the\nweaker does the presumption itself get to be; and one might in course\nof time use up one's presumptive privileges in this way, even though\none started (as our anti-telepathists do) with as good a case as the\ngreat induction of psychology that all our knowledge comes by the use\nof our eyes and ears and other senses.  And we must remember also that\nthis undermining of the strength of a presumption by reiterated report\nof facts to the contrary does not logically require that the facts in\nquestion should all be well proved.  A lot of rumors in the air against\na business man's credit, though they might all be vague, and no one of\nthem amount to proof that he is unsound, would certainly weaken the\n_presumption_ of his soundness.  And all the more would they have this\neffect if they formed what Gurney called a fagot and not a chain,--that\nis, if they were independent of one another, and came from different\nquarters.  Now, the evidence for telepathy, weak and strong, taken just\nas it comes, forms a fagot and not a chain.  No one item cites the\ncontent of another item as part of its own proof.  But taken together\nthe items have a certain general consistency; there is a method in\ntheir madness, so to speak.  So each of them adds presumptive value to\nthe lot; and cumulatively, as no candid mind can fail to see, they\nsubtract presumptive force from the orthodox belief that there can be\nnothing in any one's intellect that has not come in through ordinary\nexperiences of sense.\nBut it is a miserable thing for a question of truth {319} to be\nconfined to mere presumption and counter-presumption, with no decisive\nthunderbolt of fact to clear the baffling darkness.  And, sooth to say,\nin talking so much of the merely presumption-weakening value of our\nrecords, I have myself been wilfully taking the point of view of the\nso-called 'rigorously scientific' disbeliever, and making an _ad\nhominem_ plea.  My own point of view is different.  For me the\nthunderbolt _has_ fallen, and the orthodox belief has not merely had\nits presumption weakened, but the truth itself of the belief is\ndecisively overthrown.  If I may employ the language of the\nprofessional logic-shop, a universal proposition can be made untrue by\na particular instance.  If you wish to upset the law that all crows are\nblack, you must not seek to show that no crows are; it is enough if you\nprove one single crow to be white.  My own white crow is Mrs. Piper.\nIn the trances of this medium, I cannot resist the conviction that\nknowledge appears which she has never gained by the ordinary waking use\nof her eyes and ears and wits.  What the source of this knowledge may\nbe I know not, and have not the glimmer of an explanatory suggestion to\nmake; but from admitting the fact of such knowledge I can see no\nescape.  So when I turn to the rest of the evidence, ghosts and all, I\ncannot carry with me the irreversibly negative bias of the 'rigorously\nscientific' mind, with its presumption as to what the true order of\nnature ought to be.  I feel as if, though the evidence be flimsy in\nspots, it may nevertheless collectively carry heavy weight.  The\nrigorously scientific mind may, in truth, easily overshoot the mark.\nScience means, first of all, a certain dispassionate method.  To\nsuppose that it means a certain set of {320} results that one should\npin one's faith upon and hug forever is sadly to mistake its genius,\nand degrades the scientific body to the status of a sect.\nWe all, scientists and non-scientists, live on some inclined plane of\ncredulity.  The plane tips one way in one man, another way in another;\nand may he whose plane tips in no way be the first to cast a stone!  As\na matter of fact, the trances I speak of have broken down for my own\nmind the limits of the admitted order of nature.  Science, so far as\nscience denies such exceptional occurrences, lies prostrate in the dust\nfor me; and the most urgent intellectual need which I feel at present\nis that science be built up again in a form in which such things may\nhave a positive place.  Science, like life, feeds on its own decay.\nNew facts burst old rules; then newly divined conceptions bind old and\nnew together into a reconciling law.\nAnd here is the real instructiveness of Messrs. Myers and Gurney's\nwork.  They are trying with the utmost conscientiousness to find a\nreconciling conception which shall subject the old laws of nature to\nthe smallest possible strain.  Mr. Myers uses that method of gradual\napproach which has performed such wonders in Darwin's hands.  When\nDarwin met a fact which seemed a poser to his theory, his regular\ncustom, as I have heard an able colleague say, was to fill in all round\nit with smaller facts, as a wagoner might heap dirt round a big rock in\nthe road, and thus get his team over without upsetting.  So Mr. Myers,\nstarting from the most ordinary facts of inattentive consciousness,\nfollows this clue through a long series which terminates in ghosts, and\nseeks to show that these are but extreme manifestations of a {321}\ncommon truth,--the truth that the invisible segments of our minds are\nsusceptible, under rarely realized conditions, of acting and being\nacted upon by the invisible segments of other conscious lives.  This\nmay not be ultimately true (for the theosophists, with their astral\nbodies and the like, may, for aught I now know, prove to be on the\ncorrecter trail), but no one can deny that it is in good scientific\nform,--for science always takes a known kind of phenomenon, and tries\nto extend its range.\nI have myself, as American agent for the census, collected hundreds of\ncases of hallucination in healthy persons.  The result is to make me\nfeel that we all have potentially a 'subliminal' self, which may make\nat any time irruption into our ordinary lives.  At its lowest, it is\nonly the depository of our forgotten memories; at its highest, we do\nnot know what it is at all.  Take, for instance, a series of cases.\nDuring sleep, many persons have something in them which measures the\nflight of time better than the waking self does.  It wakes them at a\npreappointed hour; it acquaints them with the moment when they first\nawake.  It may produce an hallucination,--as in a lady who informs me\nthat at the instant of waking she has a vision of her watch-face with\nthe hands pointing (as she has often verified) to the exact time.  It\nmay be the feeling that some physiological period has elapsed; but,\nwhatever it is, it is subconscious.\nA subconscious something may also preserve experiences to which we do\nnot openly attend.  A lady taking her lunch in town finds herself\nwithout her purse.  Instantly a sense comes over her of rising from the\nbreakfast-table and hearing her purse drop upon the floor.  On reaching\nhome she finds {322} nothing under the table, but summons the servant\nto say where she has put the purse.  The servant produces it, saying;\n\"How did you know where it was?  You rose and left the room as if you\ndid n't know you 'd dropped it.\"  The same subconscious something may\nrecollect what we have forgotten.  A lady accustomed to taking\nsalicylate of soda for muscular rheumatism wakes one early winter\nmorning with an aching neck.  In the twilight she takes what she\nsupposes to be her customary powder from a drawer, dissolves it in a\nglass of water, and is about to drink it down, when she feels a sharp\nslap on her shoulder and hears a voice in her ear saying, \"Taste it!\"\nOn examination, she finds she has got a morphine powder by mistake.\nThe natural interpretation is that a sleeping memory of the morphine\npowders awoke in this quasi-explosive way.  A like explanation offers\nitself as most plausible for the following case: A lady, with little\ntime to catch the train, and the expressman about to call, is excitedly\nlooking for the lost key of a packed trunk.  Hurrying upstairs with a\nbunch of keys, proved useless, in her hand, she hears an 'objective'\nvoice distinctly say, \"Try the key of the cake-box.\"  Being tried, it\nfits.  This also may well have been the effect of forgotten experience.\nNow, the effect is doubtless due to the same hallucinatory mechanism;\nbut the source is less easily assigned as we ascend the scale of cases.\nA lady, for instance, goes after breakfast to see about one of her\nservants who has become ill over night.  She is startled at distinctly\nreading over the bedroom door in gilt letters the word 'small-pox.'\nThe doctor is sent for, and ere long pronounces small-pox to be the\ndisease, although the lady says, \"The thought of {323} the girl's\nhaving small-pox never entered my mind till I saw the apparent\ninscription.\"  Then come other cases of warning; for example, that of a\nyouth sitting in a wagon under a shed, who suddenly hears his dead\nmother's voice say, \"Stephen, get away from here quick!\" and jumps out\njust in time to see the shed-roof fall.\nAfter this come the experiences of persons appearing to distant friends\nat or near the hour of death.  Then, too, we have the trance-visions\nand utterances, which may appear astonishingly profuse and continuous,\nand maintain a fairly high intellectual level.  For all these higher\nphenomena, it seems to me that while the proximate mechanism is that of\n'hallucination,' it is straining an hypothesis unduly to name any\nordinary subconscious mental operation--such as expectation,\nrecollection, or inference from inattentive perception--as the ultimate\ncause that starts it up.  It is far better tactics, if you wish to get\nrid of mystery, to brand the narratives themselves as unworthy of\ntrust.  The trustworthiness of most of them is to my own mind far from\nproved.  And yet in the light of the medium-trance, which is proved, it\nseems as if they might well all be members of a natural kind of fact of\nwhich we do not yet know the full extent.\nThousands of sensitive organizations in the United States to-day live\nas steadily in the light of these experiences, and are as indifferent\nto modern science, as if they lived in Bohemia in the twelfth century.\nThey are indifferent to science, because science is so callously\nindifferent to their experiences.  Although in its essence science only\nstands for a method and for no fixed belief, yet as habitually taken,\nboth by its votaries and outsiders, it is {324} identified with a\ncertain fixed belief,--the belief that the hidden order of nature is\nmechanical exclusively, and that non-mechanical categories are\nirrational ways of conceiving and explaining even such things as human\nlife.  Now, this mechanical rationalism, as one may call it, makes, if\nit becomes one's only way of thinking, a violent breach with the ways\nof thinking that have played the greatest part in human history.\nReligious thinking, ethical thinking, poetical thinking, teleological,\nemotional, sentimental thinking, what one might call the personal view\nof life to distinguish it from the impersonal and mechanical, and the\nromantic view of life to distinguish it from the rationalistic view,\nhave been, and even still are, outside of well-drilled scientific\ncircles, the dominant forms of thought.  But for mechanical\nrationalism, personality is an insubstantial illusion.  The chronic\nbelief of mankind, that events may happen for the sake of their\npersonal significance, is an abomination; and the notions of our\ngrandfathers about oracles and omens, divinations and apparitions,\nmiraculous changes of heart and wonders worked by inspired persons,\nanswers to prayer and providential leadings, are a fabric absolutely\nbaseless, a mass of sheer _un_truth.\nNow, of course, we must all admit that the excesses to which the\nromantic and personal view of nature may lead, if wholly unchecked by\nimpersonal rationalism, are direful.  Central African Mumbo-jumboism is\none of unchecked romanticism's fruits.  One ought accordingly to\nsympathize with that abhorrence of romanticism as a sufficient\nworld-theory; one ought to understand that lively intolerance of the\nleast grain of romanticism in the views of life of other people, which\nare such characteristic marks of those who {325} follow the scientific\nprofessions to-day.  Our debt to science is literally boundless, and\nour gratitude for what is positive in her teachings must be\ncorrespondingly immense.  But the S. P. R.'s Proceedings have, it seems\nto me, conclusively proved one thing to the candid reader; and that is\nthat the verdict of pure insanity, of gratuitous preference for error,\nof superstition without an excuse, which the scientists of our day are\nled by their intellectual training to pronounce upon the entire thought\nof the past, is a most shallow verdict.  The personal and romantic view\nof life has other roots besides wanton exuberance of imagination and\nperversity of heart.  It is perennially fed by _facts of experience_,\nwhatever the ulterior interpretation of those facts may prove to be;\nand at no time in human history would it have been less easy than\nnow--at most times it would have been much more easy--for advocates\nwith a little industry to collect in its favor an array of contemporary\ndocuments as good as those which our publications present.  These\ndocuments all relate to real experiences of persons.  These experiences\nhave three characters in common: They are capricious, discontinuous,\nand not easily controlled; they require peculiar persons for their\nproduction; their significance seems to be wholly for personal life.\nThose who preferentially attend to them, and still more those who are\nindividually subject to them, not only easily may find, but are\nlogically bound to find, in them valid arguments for their romantic and\npersonal conception of the world's course.  Through my slight\nparticipation in the investigations of the S. P. R. I have become\nacquainted with numbers of persons of this sort, for whom the very word\n'science' has become a name of reproach, for reasons that I now both\nunderstand {326} and respect.  It is the intolerance of science for\nsuch phenomena as we are studying, her peremptory denial either of\ntheir existence or of their significance (except as proofs of man's\nabsolute innate folly), that has set science so apart from the common\nsympathies of the race.  I confess that it is on this, its humanizing\nmission, that the Society's best claim to the gratitude of our\ngeneration seems to me to depend.  It has restored continuity to\nhistory.  It has shown some reasonable basis for the most superstitious\naberrations of the foretime.  It has bridged the chasm, healed the\nhideous rift that science, taken in a certain narrow way, has shot into\nthe human world.\nI will even go one step farther.  When from our present advanced\nstandpoint we look back upon the past stages of human thought, whether\nit be scientific thought or theological thought, we are amazed that a\nuniverse which appears to us of so vast and mysterious a complication\nshould ever have seemed to any one so little and plain a thing.\nWhether it be Descartes's world or Newton's, whether it be that of the\nmaterialists of the last century or that of the Bridgewater treatises\nof our own, it always looks the same to us,--incredibly perspectiveless\nand short.  Even Lyell's, Faraday's, Mill's, and Darwin's consciousness\nof their respective subjects are already beginning to put on an\ninfantile and innocent look.  Is it then likely that the science of our\nown day will escape the common doom; that the minds of its votaries\nwill never look old-fashioned to the grandchildren of the latter?  It\nwould be folly to suppose so.  Yet if we are to judge by the analogy of\nthe past, when our science once becomes old-fashioned, it will be more\nfor its omissions of fact, for its {327} ignorance of whole ranges and\norders of complexity in the phenomena to be explained, than for any\nfatal lack in its spirit and principles.  The spirit and principles of\nscience are mere affairs of method; there is nothing in them that need\nhinder science from dealing successfully with a world in which personal\nforces are the starting-point of new effects.  The only form of thing\nthat we directly encounter, the only experience that we concretely\nhave, is our own personal life.  The only complete category of our\nthinking, our professors of philosophy tell us, is the category of\npersonality, every other category being one of the abstract elements of\nthat.  And this systematic denial on science's part of personality as a\ncondition of events, this rigorous belief that in its own essential and\ninnermost nature our world is a strictly impersonal world, may,\nconceivably, as the whirligig of time goes round, prove to be the very\ndefect that our descendants will be most surprised at in our own\nboasted science, the omission that to their eyes will most tend to make\nit look perspectiveless and short.\n[1] This Essay is formed of portions of an article in Scribner's\nMagazine for March, 1890, of an article in the Forum for July, 1892,\nand of the President's Address before the Society for Psychical\nResearch, published in the Proceedings for June, 1896, and in Science.\n[2] Written in 1891.

The process of Philosophizing:\nPhilosophers choose some part of the world to interpret the whole by, 8.\nThey seek to make it seem less strange, 11. Their temperamental\ndifferences, 12. Their systems must be reasoned out, 13. Their tendency\nto over-technicality, 15. Excess of this in Germany, 17. The type of\nvision is the important thing in a philosopher, 20. Primitive thought,\n21. Spiritualism and Materialism: Spiritualism shows two types, 23.\nTheism and Pantheism, 24. Theism makes a duality of Man and God, and\nleaves Man an outsider, 25. Pantheism identifies Man with God, 29. The\ncontemporary tendency is towards Pantheism, 30. Legitimacy of our demand\nto be essential in the Universe, 33. Pluralism versus Monism: The 'each-\nform' and the 'all-form' of representing the world, 34. Professor Jacks\nquoted, 35. Absolute Idealism characterized, 36.

Leibnitz and Lotze on the 'fall'\ninvolved in the creation of the finite, 119. Joachim on the fall of\ntruth into error, 121. The world of the absolutist cannot be perfect,\n123.

This\nassumption is held in common by naturalistic psychology, by\ntranscendental idealism, and by Fechner, 184. Criticism of it by the\npresent writer in a former book, 188. Physical combinations, so-called,\ncannot be invoked as analogous, 194. Nevertheless, combination must be\npostulated among the parts of the Universe, 197. The logical objections\nto admitting it, 198. Rationalistic treatment of the question brings us\nto an _impasse_, 208. A radical breach with intellectualism is required,\n212.

Achilles and the tortoise, 228.\nNot a sophism, 229. We make motion unintelligible when we treat it by\nstatic concepts, 233. Conceptual treatment is nevertheless of immense\npractical use, 235. The traditional rationalism gives an essentially\nstatic universe, 237. Intolerableness of the intellectualist view, 240.\nNo rationalist account is possible of action, change, or immediate life,\n244. The function of concepts is practical rather than theoretical, 247.\nBergson remands us to intuition or sensational experience for the\nunderstanding of how life makes itself go, 252. What Bergson means by\nthis, 255. Manyness in oneness must be admitted, 256. What really exists\nis not things made, but things in the making, 263. Bergson's\noriginality, 264. Impotence of intellectualist logic to define a\nuniverse where change is continuous, 267. Livingly, things _are_ their\nown others, so that there is a sense in which Hegel's logic is true,\n270.\nLECTURE VII\nTHE CONTINUITY OF EXPERIENCE 275\nGreen's critique of Sensationalism, 278. Relations are as immediately\nfelt as terms are, 280. The union of things is given in the immediate\nflux, not in any conceptual reason that overcomes the flux's aboriginal\nincoherence, 282. The minima of experience as vehicles of continuity,\n284. Fallacy of the objections to self-compounding, 286. The concrete\nunits of experience are 'their own others,' 287. Reality is confluent\nfrom next to next, 290. Intellectualism must be sincerely renounced,\n291. The Absolute is only an hypothesis, 292. Fechner's God is not the\nAbsolute, 298. The Absolute solves no intellectualist difficulty, 296.\nDoes superhuman consciousness probably exist? 298.\nLECTURE VIII\nCONCLUSIONS 301\nSpecifically religious experiences occur, 303. Their nature, 304.\nThey corroborate the notion of a larger life of which we are a part,\n308. This life must be finite if we are to escape the paradoxes of\nmonism, 310. God as a finite being, 311. Empiricism is a better\nally than rationalism, of religion, 313. Empirical proofs of larger\nmind may open the door to superstitions, 315. But this objection\nshould not be deemed fatal, 316. Our beliefs form parts of reality,\n317. In pluralistic empiricism our relation to God remains least\nforeign, 318. The word 'rationality' had better be replaced by the\nword 'intimacy,' 319. Monism and pluralism distinguished and\ndefined, 321. Pluralism involves indeterminism, 324. All men use\nthe 'faith-ladder' in reaching their decision, 328. Conclusion, 330.\nNOTES 333\nAPPENDICES\nA. THE THING AND ITS RELATIONS 847\nB. THE EXPERIENCE OF ACTIVITY 870\nC. ON THE NOTION OF REALITY AS CHANGING 895\nINDEX 401\nLECTURE I\nTHE TYPES OF PHILOSOPHIC THINKING\nAs these lectures are meant to be public, and so few, I have assumed\nall very special problems to be excluded, and some topic of general\ninterest required. Fortunately, our age seems to be growing\nphilosophical again--still in the ashes live the wonted fires. Oxford,\nlong the seed-bed, for the english world, of the idealism inspired by\nKant and Hegel, has recently become the nursery of a very different\nway of thinking. Even non-philosophers have begun to take an interest\nin a controversy over what is known as pluralism or humanism. It\nlooks a little as if the ancient english empirism, so long put out of\nfashion here by nobler sounding germanic formulas, might be repluming\nitself and getting ready for a stronger flight than ever. It looks as\nif foundations were being sounded and examined afresh.\nIndividuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying\nevery one we meet under some general head. As these heads usually\nsuggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life\nof philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing, and\ncomplaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up,\nand, on the whole, less acrimony in discussion, for which both Oxford\nand Harvard are partly to be thanked. As I look back into the sixties,\nMill, Bain, and Hamilton were the only official philosophers in\nBritain. Spencer, Martineau, and Hodgson were just beginning. In\nFrance, the pupils of Cousin were delving into history only, and\nRenouvier alone had an original system. In Germany, the hegelian\nimpetus had spent itself, and, apart from historical scholarship,\nnothing but the materialistic controversy remained, with such men as\nB\u00fcchner and Ulrici as its champions. Lotze and Fechner were the sole\noriginal thinkers, and Fechner was not a professional philosopher at\nall.\nThe general impression made was of crude issues and oppositions, of\nsmall subtlety and of a widely spread ignorance. Amateurishness was\nrampant. Samuel Bailey's 'letters on the philosophy of the human\nmind,' published in 1855, are one of the ablest expressions of english\nassociationism, and a book of real power. Yet hear how he writes of\nKant: 'No one, after reading the extracts, etc., can be surprised to\nhear of a declaration by men of eminent abilities, that, after years\nof study, they had not succeeded in gathering one clear idea from the\nspeculations of Kant. I should have been almost surprised if they had.\nIn or about 1818, Lord Grenville, when visiting the Lakes of England,\nobserved to Professor Wilson that, after five years' study of Kant's\nphilosophy, he had not gathered from it one clear idea. Wilberforce,\nabout the same time, made the same confession to another friend of\nmy own. \"I am endeavoring,\" exclaims Sir James Mackintosh, in the\nirritation, evidently, of baffled efforts, \"to understand this\naccursed german philosophy.\"[1]\nWhat Oxford thinker would dare to print such _na\u00eff_ and\nprovincial-sounding citations of authority to-day?\nThe torch of learning passes from land to land as the spirit bloweth\nthe flame. The deepening of philosophic consciousness came to us\nenglish folk from Germany, as it will probably pass back ere long.\nFerrier, J.H. Stirling, and, most of all, T.H. Green are to be\nthanked. If asked to tell in broad strokes what the main doctrinal\nchange has been, I should call it a change from the crudity of the\nolder english thinking, its ultra-simplicity of mind, both when it was\nreligious and when it was anti-religious, toward a rationalism\nderived in the first instance from Germany, but relieved from german\ntechnicality and shrillness, and content to suggest, and to remain\nvague, and to be, in, the english fashion, devout.\nBy the time T.H. Green began at Oxford, the generation seemed to\nfeel as if it had fed on the chopped straw of psychology and of\nassociationism long enough, and as if a little vastness, even though\nit went with vagueness, as of some moist wind from far away, reminding\nus of our pre-natal sublimity, would be welcome.\nGreen's great point of attack was the disconnectedness of the reigning\nenglish sensationalism. _Relating_ was the great intellectual activity\nfor him, and the key to this relating was believed by him to\nlodge itself at last in what most of you know as Kant's unity of\napperception, transformed into a living spirit of the world.\nHence a monism of a devout kind. In some way we must be fallen angels,\none with intelligence as such; and a great disdain for empiricism\nof the sensationalist sort has always characterized this school of\nthought, which, on the whole, has reigned supreme at Oxford and in the\nScottish universities until the present day.\nBut now there are signs of its giving way to a wave of revised\nempiricism. I confess that I should be glad to see this latest wave\nprevail; so--the sooner I am frank about it the better--I hope to\nhave my voice counted in its favor as one of the results of this\nlecture-course.\nWhat do the terms empiricism and rationalism mean? Reduced to their\nmost pregnant difference, _empiricism means the habit of explaining\nwholes by parts, and rationalism means the habit of explaining parts\nby wholes_. Rationalism thus preserves affinities with monism, since\nwholeness goes with union, while empiricism inclines to pluralistic\nviews. No philosophy can ever be anything but a summary sketch, a\npicture of the world in abridgment, a foreshortened bird's-eye view of\nthe perspective of events. And the first thing to notice is this, that\nthe only material we have at our disposal for making a picture of the\nwhole world is supplied by the various portions of that world of\nwhich we have already had experience. We can invent no new forms of\nconception, applicable to the whole exclusively, and not suggested\noriginally by the parts. All philosophers, accordingly, have conceived\nof the whole world after the analogy of some particular feature of it\nwhich has particularly captivated their attention. Thus, the theists\ntake their cue from manufacture, the pantheists from growth. For one\nman, the world is like a thought or a grammatical sentence in which a\nthought is expressed. For such a philosopher, the whole must logically\nbe prior to the parts; for letters would never have been invented\nwithout syllables to spell, or syllables without words to utter.\nAnother man, struck by the disconnectedness and mutual accidentality\nof so many of the world's details, takes the universe as a whole to\nhave been such a disconnectedness originally, and supposes order to\nhave been superinduced upon it in the second instance, possibly\nby attrition and the gradual wearing away by internal friction of\nportions that originally interfered.\nAnother will conceive the order as only a statistical appearance, and\nthe universe will be for him like a vast grab-bag with black and white\nballs in it, of which we guess the quantities only probably, by the\nfrequency with which we experience their egress.\nFor another, again, there is no really inherent order, but it is we\nwho project order into the world by selecting objects and tracing\nrelations so as to gratify our intellectual interests. We _carve out_\norder by leaving the disorderly parts out; and the world is conceived\nthus after the analogy of a forest or a block of marble from which\nparks or statues may be produced by eliminating irrelevant trees or\nchips of stone.\nSome thinkers follow suggestions from human life, and treat the\nuniverse as if it were essentially a place in which ideals are\nrealized. Others are more struck by its lower features, and for them,\nbrute necessities express its character better.\nAll follow one analogy or another; and all the analogies are with some\none or other of the universe's subdivisions. Every one is nevertheless\nprone to claim that his conclusions are the only logical ones, that\nthey are necessities of universal reason, they being all the while, at\nbottom, accidents more or less of personal vision which had far better\nbe avowed as such; for one man's vision may be much more valuable than\nanother's, and our visions are usually not only our most interesting\nbut our most respectable contributions to the world in which we play\nour part. What was reason given to men for, said some eighteenth\ncentury writer, except to enable them to find reasons for what they\nwant to think and do?--and I think the history of philosophy largely\nbears him out, 'The aim of knowledge,' says Hegel,[2] 'is to divest\nthe objective world of its strangeness, and to make us more at home\nin it.' Different men find their minds more at home in very different\nfragments of the world.\nLet me make a few comments, here, on the curious antipathies which\nthese partialities arouse. They are sovereignly unjust, for all the\nparties are human beings with the same essential interests, and no one\nof them is the wholly perverse demon which another often imagines him\nto be. Both are loyal to the world that bears them; neither wishes to\nspoil it; neither wishes to regard it as an insane incoherence; both\nwant to keep it as a universe of some kind; and their differences are\nall secondary to this deep agreement. They may be only propensities to\nemphasize differently. Or one man may care for finality and security\nmore than the other. Or their tastes in language may be different.\nOne may like a universe that lends itself to lofty and exalted\ncharacterization. To another this may seem sentimental or rhetorical.\nOne may wish for the right to use a clerical vocabulary, another a\ntechnical or professorial one. A certain old farmer of my acquaintance\nin America was called a rascal by one of his neighbors. He immediately\nsmote the man, saying,'I won't stand none of your diminutive\nepithets.' Empiricist minds, putting the parts before the whole,\nappear to rationalists, who start from the whole, and consequently\nenjoy magniloquent privileges, to use epithets offensively diminutive.\nBut all such differences are minor matters which ought to be\nsubordinated in view of the fact that, whether we be empiricists or\nrationalists, we are, ourselves, parts of the universe and share the\nsame one deep concern in its destinies. We crave alike to feel more\ntruly at home with it, and to contribute our mite to its amelioration.\nIt would be pitiful if small aesthetic discords were to keep honest\nmen asunder.\nI shall myself have use for the diminutive epithets of empiricism. But\nif you look behind the words at the spirit, I am sure you will not\nfind it matricidal. I am as good a son as any rationalist among you to\nour common mother. What troubles me more than this misapprehension is\nthe genuine abstruseness of many of the matters I shall be obliged\nto talk about, and the difficulty of making them intelligible at one\nhearing. But there two pieces, 'zwei st\u00fccke,' as Kant would have said,\nin every philosophy--the final outlook, belief, or attitude to which\nit brings us, and the reasonings by which that attitude is reached and\nmediated. A philosophy, as James Ferrier used to tell us, must indeed\nbe true, but that is the least of its requirements. One may be true\nwithout being a philosopher, true by guesswork or by revelation.\nWhat distinguishes a philosopher's truth is that it is _reasoned_.\nArgument, not supposition, must have put it in his possession. Common\nmen find themselves inheriting their beliefs, they know not how. They\njump into them with both feet, and stand there. Philosophers must\ndo more; they must first get reason's license for them; and to the\nprofessional philosophic mind the operation of procuring the license\nis usually a thing of much more pith and moment than any particular\nbeliefs to which the license may give the rights of access. Suppose,\nfor example, that a philosopher believes in what is called free-will.\nThat a common man alongside of him should also share that belief,\npossessing it by a sort of inborn intuition, does not endear the man\nto the philosopher at all--he may even be ashamed to be associated\nwith such a man. What interests the philosopher is the particular\npremises on which the free-will he believes in is established, the\nsense in which it is taken, the objections it eludes, the difficulties\nit takes account of, in short the whole form and temper and manner\nand technical apparatus that goes with the belief in question.\nA philosopher across the way who should use the same technical\napparatus, making the same distinctions, etc., but drawing opposite\nconclusions and denying free-will entirely, would fascinate the first\nphilosopher far more than would the _na\u00eff_ co-believer. Their common\ntechnical interests would unite them more than their opposite\nconclusions separate them. Each would feel an essential consanguinity\nin the other, would think of him, write _at_ him, care for his good\nopinion. The simple-minded believer in free-will would be disregarded\nby either. Neither as ally nor as opponent would his vote be counted.\nIn a measure this is doubtless as it should be, but like all\nprofessionalism it can go to abusive extremes. The end is after all\nmore than the way, in most things human, and forms and methods may\neasily frustrate their own purpose. The abuse of technicality is\nseen in the infrequency with which, in philosophical literature,\nmetaphysical questions are discussed directly and on their own merits.\nAlmost always they are handled as if through a heavy woolen curtain,\nthe veil of previous philosophers' opinions. Alternatives are wrapped\nin proper names, as if it were indecent for a truth to go naked. The\nlate Professor John Grote of Cambridge has some good remarks about\nthis. 'Thought,' he says,'is not a professional matter, not something\nfor so-called philosophers only or for professed thinkers. The best\nphilosopher is the man who can think most _simply_. ... I wish that\npeople would consider that thought--and philosophy is no more than\ngood and methodical thought--is a matter _intimate_ to them, a portion\nof their real selves ... that they would _value_ what they think, and\nbe interested in it.... In my own opinion,' he goes on, 'there is\nsomething depressing in this weight of learning, with nothing that can\ncome into one's mind but one is told, Oh, that is the opinion of such\nand such a person long ago. ... I can conceive of nothing more noxious\nfor students than to get into the habit of saying to themselves about\ntheir ordinary philosophic thought, Oh, somebody must have thought it\nall before.'[3] Yet this is the habit most encouraged at our seats of\nlearning. You must tie your opinion to Aristotle's or Spinoza's; you\nmust define it by its distance from Kant's; you must refute your\nrival's view by identifying it with Protagoras's. Thus does all\nspontaneity of thought, all freshness of conception, get destroyed.\nEverything you touch is shopworn. The over-technicality and consequent\ndreariness of the younger disciples at our american universities is\nappalling. It comes from too much following of german models and\nmanners. Let me fervently express the hope that in this country you\nwill hark back to the more humane english tradition. American students\nhave to regain direct relations with our subject by painful individual\neffort in later life. Some of us have done so. Some of the younger\nones, I fear, never will, so strong are the professional shop-habits\nalready.\nIn a subject like philosophy it is really fatal to lose connexion with\nthe open air of human nature, and to think in terms of shop-tradition\nonly. In Germany the forms are so professionalized that anybody who\nhas gained a teaching chair and written a book, however distorted and\neccentric, has the legal right to figure forever in the history of the\nsubject like a fly in amber. All later comers have the duty of quoting\nhim and measuring their opinions with his opinion. Such are the rules\nof the professorial game--they think and write from each other and for\neach other and at each other exclusively. With this exclusion of the\nopen air all true perspective gets lost, extremes and oddities count\nas much as sanities, and command the same attention; and if by chance\nany one writes popularly and about results only, with his mind\ndirectly focussed on the subject, it is reckoned _oberfl\u00e4chliches\nzeug_ and _ganz unwissenschaftlich_. Professor Paulsen has recently\nwritten some feeling lines about this over-professionalism, from\nthe reign of which in Germany his own writings, which sin by being\n'literary,' have suffered loss of credit. Philosophy, he says, has\nlong assumed in Germany the character of being an esoteric and\noccult science. There is a genuine fear of popularity. Simplicity of\nstatement is deemed synonymous with hollowness and shallowness. He\nrecalls an old professor saying to him once: 'Yes, we philosophers,\nwhenever we wish, can go so far that in a couple of sentences we can\nput ourselves where nobody can follow us.' The professor said this\nwith conscious pride, but he ought to have been ashamed of it. Great\nas technique is, results are greater. To teach philosophy so that the\npupils' interest in technique exceeds that in results is surely a\nvicious aberration. It is bad form, not good form, in a discipline\nof such universal human interest. Moreover, technique for technique,\ndoesn't David Hume's technique set, after all, the kind of pattern\nmost difficult to follow? Isn't it the most admirable? The english\nmind, thank heaven, and the french mind, are still kept, by their\naversion to crude technique and barbarism, closer to truth's natural\nprobabilities. Their literatures show fewer obvious falsities and\nmonstrosities than that of Germany. Think of the german literature of\naesthetics, with the preposterousness of such an unaesthetic personage\nas Immanuel Kant enthroned in its centre! Think of german books on\n_religions-philosophie_, with the heart's battles translated into\nconceptual jargon and made dialectic. The most persistent setter of\nquestions, feeler of objections, insister on satisfactions, is the\nreligious life. Yet all its troubles can be treated with absurdly\nlittle technicality. The wonder is that, with their way of working\nphilosophy, individual Germans should preserve any spontaneity of\nmind at all. That they still manifest freshness and originality in so\neminent a degree, proves the indestructible richness of the german\ncerebral endowment.\nLet me repeat once more that a man's vision is the great fact about\nhim. Who cares for Carlyle's reasons, or Schopenhauer's, or Spencer's?\nA philosophy is the expression of a man's intimate character, and all\ndefinitions of the universe are but the deliberately adopted reactions\nof human characters upon it. In the recent book from which I quoted\nthe words of Professor Paulsen, a book of successive chapters by\nvarious living german philosophers,[4] we pass from one idiosyncratic\npersonal atmosphere into another almost as if we were turning over a\nphotograph album.\nIf we take the whole history of philosophy, the systems reduce\nthemselves to a few main types which, under all the technical verbiage\nin which the ingenious intellect of man envelops them, are just so\nmany visions, modes of feeling the whole push, and seeing the whole\ndrift of life, forced on one by one's total character and experience,\nand on the whole _preferred_--there is no other truthful word--as\none's best working attitude. Cynical characters take one general\nattitude, sympathetic characters another. But no general attitude\nis possible towards the world as a whole, until the intellect has\ndeveloped considerable generalizing power and learned to take pleasure\nin synthetic formulas. The thought of very primitive men has hardly\nany tincture of philosophy. Nature can have little unity for savages.\nIt is a Walpurgis-nacht procession, a checkered play of light and\nshadow, a medley of impish and elfish friendly and inimical\npowers. 'Close to nature' though they live, they are anything but\nWordsworthians. If a bit of cosmic emotion ever thrills them, it is\nlikely to be at midnight, when the camp smoke rises straight to the\nwicked full moon in the zenith, and the forest is all whispering with\nwitchery and danger. The eeriness of the world, the mischief and the\nmanyness, the littleness of the forces, the magical surprises, the\nunaccountability of every agent, these surely are the characters most\nimpressive at that stage of culture, these communicate the thrills\nof curiosity and the earliest intellectual stirrings. Tempests and\nconflagrations, pestilences and earthquakes, reveal supramundane\npowers, and instigate religious terror rather than philosophy. Nature,\nmore demonic than divine, is above all things _multifarious_. So many\ncreatures that feed or threaten, that help or crush, so many beings\nto hate or love, to understand or start at--which is on top and which\nsubordinate? Who can tell? They are co-ordinate, rather, and to adapt\nourselves to them singly, to 'square' the dangerous powers and keep\nthe others friendly, regardless of consistency or unity, is the chief\nproblem. The symbol of nature at this stage, as Paulsen well says,\nis the sphinx, under whose nourishing breasts the tearing claws are\nvisible.\nBut in due course of time the intellect awoke, with its passion for\ngeneralizing, simplifying, and subordinating, and then began those\ndivergences of conception which all later experience seems rather\nto have deepened than to have effaced, because objective nature has\ncontributed to both sides impartially, and has let the thinkers\nemphasize different parts of her, and pile up opposite imaginary\nsupplements.\nPerhaps the most interesting opposition is that which results from the\nclash between what I lately called the sympathetic and the cynical\ntemper. Materialistic and spiritualistic philosophies are the rival\ntypes that result: the former defining the world so as to leave man's\nsoul upon it as a soil of outside passenger or alien, while the latter\ninsists that the intimate and human must surround and underlie the\nbrutal. This latter is the spiritual way of thinking.\nNow there are two very distinct types or stages in spiritualistic\nphilosophy, and my next purpose in this lecture is to make their\ncontrast evident. Both types attain the sought-for intimacy of view,\nbut the one attains it somewhat less successfully than the other.\nThe generic term spiritualism, which I began by using merely as the\nopposite of materialism, thus subdivides into two species, the more\nintimate one of which is monistic and the less intimate dualistic. The\ndualistic species is the _theism_ that reached its elaboration in the\nscholastic philosophy, while the monistic species is the _pantheism_\nspoken of sometimes simply as idealism, and sometimes as\n'post-kantian' or 'absolute' idealism. Dualistic theism is professed\nas firmly as ever at all catholic seats of learning, whereas it has\nof late years tended to disappear at our british and american\nuniversities, and to be replaced by a monistic pantheism more or less\nopen or disguised. I have an impression that ever since T.H. Green's\ntime absolute idealism has been decidedly in the ascendent at Oxford.\nIt is in the ascendent at my own university of Harvard.\nAbsolute idealism attains, I said, to the more intimate point of view;\nbut the statement needs some explanation. So far as theism represents\nthe world as God's world, and God as what Matthew Arnold called a\nmagnified non-natural man, it would seem as if the inner quality of\nthe world remained human, and as if our relations with it might be\nintimate enough--for what is best in ourselves appears then also\noutside of ourselves, and we and the universe are of the same\nspiritual species. So far, so good, then; and one might consequently\nask, What more of intimacy do you require? To which the answer is\nthat to be like a thing is not as intimate a relation as to be\nsubstantially fused into it, to form one continuous soul and body with\nit; and that pantheistic idealism, making us entitatively one with\nGod, attains this higher reach of intimacy.\nThe theistic conception, picturing God and his creation as entities\ndistinct from each other, still leaves the human subject outside of\nthe deepest reality in the universe. God is from eternity complete, it\nsays, and sufficient unto himself; he throws off the world by a free\nact and as an extraneous substance, and he throws off man as a third\nsubstance, extraneous to both the world and himself. Between them, God\nsays 'one,' the world says 'two,' and man says 'three,'--that is the\northodox theistic view. And orthodox theism has been so jealous of\nGod's glory that it has taken pains to exaggerate everything in the\nnotion of him that could make for isolation and separateness. Page\nupon page in scholastic books go to prove that God is in no sense\nimplicated by his creative act, or involved in his creation. That his\nrelation to the creatures he has made should make any difference to\nhim, carry any consequence, or qualify his being, is repudiated as a\npantheistic slur upon his self-sufficingness. I said a moment ago that\ntheism treats us and God as of the same species, but from the orthodox\npoint of view that was a slip of language. God and his creatures\nare _toto genere_ distinct in the scholastic theology, they have\nabsolutely _nothing_ in common; nay, it degrades God to attribute to\nhim any generic nature whatever; he can be classed with nothing. There\nis a sense, then, in which philosophic theism makes us outsiders and\nkeeps us foreigners in relation to God, in which, at any rate, his\nconnexion with us appears as unilateral and not reciprocal. His action\ncan affect us, but he can never be affected by our reaction. Our\nrelation, in short, is not a strictly social relation. Of course in\ncommon men's religion the relation is believed to be social, but that\nis only one of the many differences between religion and theology.\nThis essential dualism of the theistic view has all sorts of\ncollateral consequences. Man being an outsider and a mere subject to\nGod, not his intimate partner, a character of externality invades the\nfield. God is not heart of our heart and reason of our reason, but our\nmagistrate, rather; and mechanically to obey his commands, however\nstrange they may be, remains our only moral duty. Conceptions of\ncriminal law have in fact played a great part in defining our\nrelations with him. Our relations with speculative truth show the\nsame externality. One of our duties is to know truth, and rationalist\nthinkers have always assumed it to be our sovereign duty. But in\nscholastic theism we find truth already instituted and established\nwithout our help, complete apart from our knowing; and the most we\ncan do is to acknowledge it passively and adhere to it, altho such\nadhesion as ours can make no jot of difference to what is adhered to.\nThe situation here again is radically dualistic. It is not as if the\nworld came to know itself, or God came to know himself, partly through\nus, as pantheistic idealists have maintained, but truth exists _per\nse_ and absolutely, by God's grace and decree, no matter who of us\nknows it or is ignorant, and it would continue to exist unaltered,\neven though we finite knowers were all annihilated.\nIt has to be confessed that this dualism and lack of intimacy has\nalways operated as a drag and handicap on Christian thought. Orthodox\ntheology has had to wage a steady fight within the schools against the\nvarious forms of pantheistic heresy which the mystical experiences\nof religious persons, on the one hand, and the formal or aesthetic\nsuperiorities of monism to dualism, on the other, kept producing. God\nas intimate soul and reason of the universe has always seemed to some\npeople a more worthy conception than God as external creator. So\nconceived, he appeared to unify the world more perfectly, he made\nit less finite and mechanical, and in comparison with such a God an\nexternal creator seemed more like the product of a childish fancy. I\nhave been told by Hindoos that the great obstacle to the spread\nof Christianity in their country is the puerility of our dogma\nof creation. It has not sweep and infinity enough to meet the\nrequirements of even the illiterate natives of India.\nAssuredly most members of this audience are ready to side with\nHinduism in this matter. Those of us who are sexagenarians have\nwitnessed in our own persons one of those gradual mutations of\nintellectual climate, due to innumerable influences, that make the\nthought of a past generation seem as foreign to its successor as if\nit were the expression of a different race of men. The theological\nmachinery that spoke so livingly to our ancestors, with its finite age\nof the world, its creation out of nothing, its juridical morality and\neschatology, its relish for rewards and punishments, its treatment of\nGod as an external contriver, an 'intelligent and moral governor,'\nsounds as odd to most of us as if it were some outlandish savage\nreligion. The vaster vistas which scientific evolutionism has opened,\nand the rising tide of social democratic ideals, have changed the type\nof our imagination, and the older monarchical theism is obsolete or\nobsolescent. The place of the divine in the world must be more organic\nand intimate. An external creator and his institutions may still be\nverbally confessed at Church in formulas that linger by their mere\ninertia, but the life is out of them, we avoid dwelling on them, the\nsincere heart of us is elsewhere. I shall leave cynical materialism\nentirely out of our discussion as not calling for treatment before\nthis present audience, and I shall ignore old-fashioned dualistic\ntheism for the same reason. Our contemporary mind having once for all\ngrasped the possibility of a more intimate _Weltanschauung_, the only\nopinions quite worthy of arresting our attention will fall within the\ngeneral scope of what may roughly be called the pantheistic field of\nvision, the vision of God as the indwelling divine rather than the\nexternal creator, and of human life as part and parcel of that deep\nreality.\nAs we have found that spiritualism in general breaks into a more\nintimate and a less intimate species, so the more intimate species\nitself breaks into two subspecies, of which the one is more monistic,\nthe other more pluralistic in form. I say in form, for our vocabulary\ngets unmanageable if we don't distinguish between form and substance\nhere. The inner life of things must be substantially akin anyhow to\nthe tenderer parts of man's nature in any spiritualistic philosophy.\nThe word 'intimacy' probably covers the essential difference.\nMaterialism holds the foreign in things to be more primary and\nlasting, it sends us to a lonely corner with our intimacy. The brutal\naspects overlap and outwear; refinement has the feebler and more\nephemeral hold on reality.\nFrom a pragmatic point of view the difference between living against\na background of foreignness and one of intimacy means the difference\nbetween a general habit of wariness and one of trust. One might call\nit a social difference, for after all, the common _socius_ of us all\nis the great universe whose children we are. If materialistic, we\nmust be suspicious of this socius, cautious, tense, on guard. If\nspiritualistic, we may give way, embrace, and keep no ultimate fear.\nThe contrast is rough enough, and can be cut across by all sorts\nof other divisions, drawn from other points of view than that of\nforeignness and intimacy. We have so many different businesses with\nnature that no one of them yields us an all-embracing clasp. The\nphilosophic attempt to define nature so that no one's business is left\nout, so that no one lies outside the door saying 'Where do _I_ come\nin?' is sure in advance to fail. The most a philosophy can hope for is\nnot to lock out any interest forever. No matter what doors it closes,\nit must leave other doors open for the interests which it neglects.\nI have begun by shutting ourselves up to intimacy and foreignness\nbecause that makes so generally interesting a contrast, and because it\nwill conveniently introduce a farther contrast to which I wish this\nhour to lead.\nThe majority of men are sympathetic. Comparatively few are cynics\nbecause they like cynicism, and most of our existing materialists are\nsuch because they think the evidence of facts impels them, or because\nthey find the idealists they are in contact with too private and\ntender-minded; so, rather than join their company, they fly to the\nopposite extreme. I therefore propose to you to disregard materialists\naltogether for the present, and to consider the sympathetic party\nalone.\nIt is normal, I say, to be sympathetic in the sense in which I use the\nterm. Not to demand intimate relations with the universe, and not to\nwish them satisfactory, should be accounted signs of something wrong.\nAccordingly when minds of this type reach the philosophic level, and\nseek some unification of their vision, they find themselves compelled\nto correct that aboriginal appearance of things by which savages are\nnot troubled. That sphinx-like presence, with its breasts and claws,\nthat first bald multifariousness, is too discrepant an object for\nphilosophic contemplation. The intimacy and the foreignness cannot be\nwritten down as simply coexisting. An order must be made; and in that\norder the higher side of things must dominate. The philosophy of the\nabsolute agrees with the pluralistic philosophy which I am going\nto contrast with it in these lectures, in that both identify human\nsubstance with the divine substance. But whereas absolutism thinks\nthat the said substance becomes fully divine only in the form of\ntotality, and is not its real self in any form but the _all_-form, the\npluralistic view which I prefer to adopt is willing to believe that\nthere may ultimately never be an all-form at all, that the substance\nof reality may never get totally collected, that some of it may\nremain outside of the largest combination of it ever made, and that\na distributive form of reality, the _each_-form, is logically as\nacceptable and empirically as probable as the all-form commonly\nacquiesced in as so obviously the self-evident thing. The contrast\nbetween these two forms of a reality which we will agree to suppose\nsubstantially spiritual is practically the topic of this course of\nlectures. You see now what I mean by pantheism's two subspecies. If\nwe give to the monistic subspecies the name of philosophy of the\nabsolute, we may give that of radical empiricism to its pluralistic\nrival, and it may be well to distinguish them occasionally later by\nthese names.\nAs a convenient way of entering into the study of their differences,\nI may refer to a recent article by Professor Jacks of Manchester\nCollege. Professor Jacks, in some brilliant pages in the 'Hibbert\nJournal' for last October, studies the relation between the universe\nand the philosopher who describes and defines it for us. You may\nassume two cases, he says. Either what the philosopher tells us is\nextraneous to the universe he is accounting for, an indifferent\nparasitic outgrowth, so to speak; or the fact of his philosophizing\nis itself one of the things taken account of in the philosophy, and\nself-included in the description. In the former case the philosopher\nmeans by the universe everything _except_ what his own presence\nbrings; in the latter case his philosophy is itself an intimate\npart of the universe, and may be a part momentous enough to give a\ndifferent turn to what the other parts signify. It may be a\nsupreme reaction of the universe upon itself by which it rises to\nself-comprehension. It may handle itself differently in consequence of\nthis event.\nNow both empiricism and absolutism bring the philosopher inside\nand make man intimate, but the one being pluralistic and the other\nmonistic, they do so in differing ways that need much explanation. Let\nme then contrast the one with the other way of representing the status\nof the human thinker.\nFor monism the world is no collection, but one great all-inclusive\nfact outside of which is nothing--nothing is its only alternative.\nWhen the monism is idealistic, this all-enveloping fact is represented\nas an absolute mind that makes the partial facts by thinking them,\njust as we make objects in a dream by dreaming them, or personages in\na story by imagining them. To _be_, on this scheme, is, on the part of\na finite thing, to be an object for the absolute; and on the part of\nthe absolute it is to be the thinker of that assemblage of objects. If\nwe use the word 'content' here, we see that the absolute and the world\nhave an identical content. The absolute is nothing but the knowledge\nof those objects; the objects are nothing but what the absolute knows.\nThe world and the all-thinker thus compenetrate and soak each other\nup without residuum. They are but two names for the same identical\nmaterial, considered now from the subjective, and now from the\nobjective point of view--gedanke and gedachtes, as we would say if we\nwere Germans. We philosophers naturally form part of the material, on\nthe monistic scheme. The absolute makes us by thinking us, and if we\nourselves are enlightened enough to be believers in the absolute, one\nmay then say that our philosophizing is one of the ways in which the\nabsolute is conscious of itself. This is the full pantheistic scheme,\nthe _identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_, the immanence of God in his creation, a\nconception sublime from its tremendous unity. And yet that unity is\nincomplete, as closer examination will show.\nThe absolute and the world are one fact, I said, when materially\nconsidered. Our philosophy, for example, is not numerically distinct\nfrom the absolute's own knowledge of itself, not a duplicate and copy\nof it, it is part of that very knowledge, is numerically identical\nwith as much of it as our thought covers. The absolute just _is_ our\nphilosophy, along with everything else that is known, in an act of\nknowing which (to use the words of my gifted absolutist colleague\nRoyce) forms in its wholeness one luminously transparent conscious\nmoment.\nBut one as we are in this material sense with the absolute substance,\nthat being only the whole of us, and we only the parts of it, yet in a\nformal sense something like a pluralism breaks out. When we speak of\nthe absolute we _take_ the one universal known material collectively\nor integrally; when we speak of its objects, of our finite selves,\netc., we _take_ that same identical material distributively and\nseparately. But what is the use of a thing's _being_ only once if it\ncan be _taken_ twice over, and if being taken in different ways makes\ndifferent things true of it? As the absolute takes me, for example, I\nappear _with_ everything else in its field of perfect knowledge. As\nI take myself, I appear _without_ most other things in my field\nof relative ignorance. And practical differences result from its\nknowledge and my ignorance. Ignorance breeds mistake, curiosity,\nmisfortune, pain, for me; I suffer those consequences. The absolute\nknows of those things, of course, for it knows me and my suffering,\nbut it doesn't itself suffer. It can't be ignorant, for simultaneous\nwith its knowledge of each question goes its knowledge of each answer.\nIt can't be patient, for it has to wait for nothing, having everything\nat once in its possession. It can't be surprised; it can't be guilty.\nNo attribute connected with succession can be applied to it, for it\nis all at once and wholly what it is, 'with the unity of a single\ninstant,' and succession is not of it but in it, for we are\ncontinually told that it is 'timeless.'\nThings true of the world in its finite aspects, then, are not true of\nit in its infinite capacity. _Qu\u00e2_ finite and plural its accounts of\nitself to itself are different from what its account to itself _qu\u00e2_\ninfinite and one must be.\nWith this radical discrepancy between the absolute and the relative\npoints of view, it seems to me that almost as great a bar to intimacy\nbetween the divine and the human breaks out in pantheism as that which\nwe found in monarchical theism, and hoped that pantheism might not\nshow. We humans are incurably rooted in the temporal point of view.\nThe eternal's ways are utterly unlike our ways. 'Let us imitate the\nAll,' said the original prospectus of that admirable Chicago quarterly\ncalled the 'Monist.' As if we could, either in thought or conduct!\nWe are invincibly parts, let us talk as we will, and must always\napprehend the absolute as if it were a foreign being. If what I mean\nby this is not wholly clear to you at this point, it ought to grow\nclearer as my lectures proceed.\nLECTURE II\nMONISTIC IDEALISM\nLet me recall to you the programme which I indicated to you at our\nlast meeting. After agreeing not to consider materialism in any\nshape, but to place ourselves straightway upon a more spiritualistic\nplatform, I pointed out three kinds of spiritual philosophy between\nwhich we are asked to choose. The first way was that of the older\ndualistic theism, with ourselves represented as a secondary order of\nsubstances created by God. We found that this allowed of a degree of\nintimacy with the creative principle inferior to that implied in the\npantheistic belief that we are substantially one with it, and that the\ndivine is therefore the most intimate of all our possessions, heart of\nour heart, in fact. But we saw that this pantheistic belief could be\nheld in two forms, a monistic form which I called philosophy of the\nabsolute, and a pluralistic form which I called radical empiricism,\nthe former conceiving that the divine exists authentically only when\nthe world is experienced all at once in its absolute totality, whereas\nradical empiricism allows that the absolute sum-total of things may\nnever be actually experienced or realized in that shape at all, and\nthat a disseminated, distributed, or incompletely unified appearance\nis the only form that reality may yet have achieved.\nI may contrast the monistic and pluralistic forms in question as\nthe 'all-form' and the 'each-form.' At the end of the last hour I\nanimadverted on the fact that the all-form is so radically different\nfrom the each-form, which is our human form of experiencing the\nworld, that the philosophy of the absolute, so far as insight and\nunderstanding go, leaves us almost as much outside of the divine being\nas dualistic theism does. I believe that radical empiricism, on the\ncontrary, holding to the each-form, and making of God only one of the\neaches, affords the higher degree of intimacy. The general thesis of\nthese lectures I said would be a defence of the pluralistic against\nthe monistic view. Think of the universe as existing solely in the\neach-form, and you will have on the whole a more reasonable and\nsatisfactory idea of it than if you insist on the all-form being\nnecessary. The rest of my lectures will do little more than make this\nthesis more concrete, and I hope more persuasive.\nIt is curious how little countenance radical pluralism has ever had\nfrom philosophers. Whether materialistically or spiritualistically\nminded, philosophers have always aimed at cleaning up the litter with\nwhich the world apparently is filled. They have substituted economical\nand orderly conceptions for the first sensible tangle; and whether\nthese were morally elevated or only intellectually neat they were\nat any rate always aesthetically pure and definite, and aimed at\nascribing to the world something clean and intellectual in the way of\ninner structure. As compared with all these rationalizing pictures,\nthe pluralistic empiricism which I profess offers but a sorry\nappearance. It is a turbid, muddled, gothic sort of an affair, without\na sweeping outline and with little pictorial nobility. Those of you\nwho are accustomed to the classical constructions of reality may be\nexcused if your first reaction upon it be absolute contempt--a\nshrug of the shoulders as if such ideas were unworthy of explicit\nrefutation. But one must have lived some time with a system to\nappreciate its merits. Perhaps a little more familiarity may mitigate\nyour first surprise at such a programme as I offer.\nFirst, one word more than what I said last time about the relative\nforeignness of the divine principle in the philosophy of the absolute.\nThose of you who have read the last two chapters of Mr. Bradley's\nwonderful book, 'Appearance and reality,' will remember what an\nelaborately foreign aspect _his_ absolute is finally made to assume.\nIt is neither intelligence nor will, neither a self nor a collection\nof selves, neither truthful, good, nor beautiful, as we understand\nthese terms. It is, in short, a metaphysical monster, all that we are\npermitted to say of it being that whatever it is, it is at any rate\n_worth_ more (worth more to itself, that is) than if any eulogistic\nadjectives of ours applied to it. It is us, and all other appearances,\nbut none of us _as such_, for in it we are all 'transmuted,' and its\nown as-suchness is of another denomination altogether.\nSpinoza was the first great absolutist, and the impossibility of being\nintimate with _his_ God is universally recognized. _Quatenus infinitus\nest_ he is other than what he is _quatenus humanam mentem constituit_.\nSpinoza's philosophy has been rightly said to be worked by the word\n_quatenus_. Conjunctions, prepositions, and adverbs play indeed the\nvital part in all philosophies; and in contemporary idealism the words\n'as' and 'qu\u00e2' bear the burden of reconciling metaphysical unity with\nphenomenal diversity. Qu\u00e2 absolute the world is one and perfect, qu\u00e2\nrelative it is many and faulty, yet it is identically the self-same\nworld--instead of talking of it as many facts, we call it one fact in\nmany aspects.\n_As_ absolute, then, or _sub specie eternitatis_, or _quatenus\ninfinitus est_, the world repels our sympathy because it has no\nhistory. _As such_, the absolute neither acts nor suffers, nor loves\nnor hates; it has no needs, desires, or aspirations, no failures or\nsuccesses, friends or enemies, victories or defeats. All such things\npertain to the world qu\u00e2 relative, in which our finite experiences\nlie, and whose vicissitudes alone have power to arouse our interest.\nWhat boots it to tell me that the absolute way is the true way, and\nto exhort me, as Emerson says, to lift mine eye up to its style, and\nmanners of the sky, if the feat is impossible by definition? I am\nfinite once for all, and all the categories of my sympathy are knit up\nwith the finite world _as such_, and with things that have a history.\n'Aus dieser erde quellen meine freuden, und ihre sonne scheinet meinen\nleiden.' I have neither eyes nor ears nor heart nor mind for anything\nof an opposite description, and the stagnant felicity of the\nabsolute's own perfection moves me as little as I move it. If we were\n_readers_ only of the cosmic novel, things would be different: we\nshould then share the author's point of view and recognize villains to\nbe as essential as heroes in the plot. But we are not the readers but\nthe very personages of the world-drama. In your own eyes each of you\nhere is its hero, and the villains are your respective friends or\nenemies. The tale which the absolute reader finds so perfect, we spoil\nfor one another through our several vital identifications with the\ndestinies of the particular personages involved.\nThe doctrine on which the absolutists lay most stress is the\nabsolute's 'timeless' character. For pluralists, on the other hand,\ntime remains as real as anything, and nothing in the universe is great\nor static or eternal enough not to have some history. But the world\nthat each of us feels most intimately at home with is that of beings\nwith histories that play into our history, whom we can help in their\nvicissitudes even as they help us in ours. This satisfaction the\nabsolute denies us; we can neither help nor hinder it, for it stands\noutside of history. It surely is a merit in a philosophy to make the\nvery life we lead seem real and earnest. Pluralism, in exorcising the\nabsolute, exorcises the great de-realizer of the only life we are\nat home in, and thus redeems the nature of reality from essential\nforeignness. Every end, reason, motive, object of desire or aversion,\nground of sorrow or joy that we feel is in the world of finite\nmultifariousness, for only in that world does anything really happen,\nonly there do events come to pass.\nIn one sense this is a far-fetched and rather childish objection, for\nso much of the history of the finite is as formidably foreign to us as\nthe static absolute can possibly be--in fact that entity derives its\nown foreignness largely from the bad character of the finite which it\nsimultaneously is--that this sentimental reason for preferring the\npluralistic view seems small.[1] I shall return to the subject in my\nfinal lecture, and meanwhile, with your permission, I will say no more\nabout this objection. The more so as the necessary foreignness of the\nabsolute is cancelled emotionally by its attribute of _totality_,\nwhich is universally considered to carry the further attribute of\n_perfection_ in its train. 'Philosophy,' says a recent american\nphilosopher, 'is humanity's hold on totality,' and there is no doubt\nthat most of us find that the bare notion of an absolute all-one is\ninspiring. 'I yielded myself to the perfect whole,' writes Emerson;\nand where can you find a more mind-dilating object? A certain loyalty\nis called forth by the idea; even if not proved actual, it must be\nbelieved in somehow. Only an enemy of philosophy can speak lightly\nof it. Rationalism starts from the idea of such a whole and builds\ndownward. Movement and change are absorbed into its immutability as\nforms of mere appearance. When you accept this beatific vision of\nwhat _is_, in contrast with what _goes on_, you feel as if you had\nfulfilled an intellectual duty. 'Reality is not in its truest nature\na process,' Mr. McTaggart tells us, 'but a stable and timeless\nstate.'[2] 'The true knowledge of God begins,' Hegel writes, 'when\nwe know that things as they immediately are have no truth.'[3] 'The\nconsummation of the infinite aim,' he says elsewhere, 'consists merely\nin removing the illusion which makes it seem yet unaccomplished. Good\nand absolute goodness is eternally accomplishing itself in the world:\nand the result is that it needs not wait upon _us_, but is already ...\naccomplished. It is an illusion under which we live. ... In the course\nof its process the Idea makes itself that illusion, by setting an\nantithesis to confront it, and its action consists in getting rid of\nthe illusion which it has created.'[4]\nBut abstract emotional appeals of any kind sound amateurish in the\nbusiness that concerns us. Impressionistic philosophizing, like\nimpressionistic watchmaking or land-surveying, is intolerable to\nexperts. Serious discussion of the alternative before us forces\nme, therefore, to become more technical. The great _claim_ of the\nphilosophy of the absolute is that the absolute is no hypothesis, but\na presupposition implicated in all thinking, and needing only a little\neffort of analysis to be seen as a logical necessity. I will therefore\ntake it in this more rigorous character and see whether its claim is\nin effect so coercive.\nIt has seemed coercive to an enormous number of contemporaneous\nthinkers. Professor Henry Jones thus describes the range and influence\nof it upon the social and political life of the present time:[5] 'For\nmany years adherents of this way of thought have deeply interested the\nbritish public by their writings. Almost more important than their\nwritings is the fact that they have occupied philosophical chairs in\nalmost every university in the kingdom. Even the professional critics\nof idealism are for the most part idealists--after a fashion. And when\nthey are not, they are as a rule more occupied with the refutation of\nidealism than with the construction of a better theory. It follows\nfrom their position of academic authority, were it from nothing else,\nthat idealism exercises an influence not easily measured upon the\nyouth of the nation--upon those, that is, who from the educational\nopportunities they enjoy may naturally be expected to become the\nleaders of the nation's thought and practice.... Difficult as it is\nto measure the forces ... it is hardly to be denied that the power\nexercised by Bentham and the utilitarian school has, for better or\nfor worse, passed into the hands of the idealists.... \"The Rhine has\nflowed into the Thames\" is the warning note rung out by Mr. Hobhouse.\nCarlyle introduced it, bringing it as far as Chelsea. Then Jowett\nand Thomas Hill Green, and William Wallace and Lewis Nettleship, and\nArnold Toynbee and David Eitchie--to mention only those teachers whose\nvoices now are silent--guided the waters into those upper reaches\nknown locally as the Isis. John and Edward Caird brought them up the\nClyde, Hutchison Stirling up the Firth of Forth. They have passed up\nthe Mersey and up the Severn and Dee and Don. They pollute the bay of\nSt. Andrews and swell the waters of the Cam, and have somehow crept\noverland into Birmingham. The stream of german idealism has been\ndiffused over the academical world of Great Britain. The disaster is\nuniversal.'\nEvidently if weight of authority were all, the truth of absolutism\nwould be thus decided. But let us first pass in review the general\nstyle of argumentation of that philosophy.\nAs I read it, its favorite way of meeting pluralism and empiricism is\nby a _reductio ad absurdum_ framed somewhat as follows: You contend,\nit says to the pluralist, that things, though in some respects\nconnected, are in other respects independent, so that they are not\nmembers of one all-inclusive individual fact. Well, your position is\nabsurd on either point. For admit in fact the slightest modicum of\nindependence, and you find (if you will only think accurately) that\nyou have to admit more and more of it, until at last nothing but an\nabsolute chaos, or the proved impossibility of any connexion whatever\nbetween the parts of the universe, remains upon your hands. Admit, on\nthe other hand, the most incipient minimum of relation between any two\nthings, and again you can't stop until you see that the absolute unity\nof all things is implied.\nIf we take the latter _reductio ad absurdum_ first, we find a good\nexample of it in Lotze's well-known proof of monism from the fact of\ninteraction between finite things. Suppose, Lotze says in effect, and\nfor simplicity's sake I have to paraphrase him, for his own words are\ntoo long to quote--many distinct beings _a, b, c_, etc., to exist\nindependently of each other: _can a in that case ever act on b_?\nWhat is it to act? Is it not to exert an influence? Does the influence\ndetach itself from _a_ and find _b_? If so, it is a third fact, and\nthe problem is not how _a_ acts, but how its 'influence' acts on _b_.\nBy another influence perhaps? And how in the end does the chain of\ninfluences find _b_ rather than _c_ unless _b_ is somehow prefigured\nin them already? And when they have found _b_, how do they make _b_\nrespond, if _b_ has nothing in common with them? Why don't they go\nright through _b_? The change in _b_ is a _response_, due to _b_'s\ncapacity for taking account of _a_'s influence, and that again seems\nto prove that _b_'s nature is somehow fitted to _a_'s nature in\nadvance. _A_ and _b_, in short, are not really as distinct as we at\nfirst supposed them, not separated by a void. Were this so they would\nbe mutually impenetrable, or at least mutually irrelevant. They would\nform two universes each living by itself, making no difference to each\nother, taking no account of each other, much as the universe of your\nday dreams takes no account of mine. They must therefore belong\ntogether beforehand, be co-implicated already, their natures must have\nan inborn mutual reference each to each.\nLotze's own solution runs as follows: The multiple independent things\nsupposed cannot be real in that shape, but all of them, if reciprocal\naction is to be possible between them, must be regarded as parts of a\nsingle real being, M. The pluralism with which our view began has\nto give place to a monism; and the 'transeunt' interaction,\nbeing unintelligible as such, is to be understood as an immanent\noperation.[6]\nThe words 'immanent operation' seem here to mean that the single real\nbeing M, of which _a_ and _b_ are members, is the only thing that\nchanges, and that when it changes, it changes inwardly and all over at\nonce. When part _a_ in it changes, consequently, part _b_ must also\nchange, but without the whole M changing this would not occur.\nA pretty argument, but a purely verbal one, as I apprehend it. _Call_\nyour _a_ and _b_ distinct, they can't interact; _call_ them one,\nthey can. For taken abstractly and without qualification the words\n'distinct' and 'independent' suggest only disconnection. If this be\nthe only property of your _a_ and _b_ (and it is the only property\nyour words imply), then of course, since you can't deduce their mutual\ninfluence from _it_, you can find no ground of its occurring between\nthem. Your bare word 'separate,' contradicting your bare word\n'joined,' seems to exclude connexion.\nLotze's remedy for the impossibility thus verbally found is to change\nthe first word. If, instead of calling _a_ and _b_ independent, we now\ncall them 'interdependent,' 'united,' or 'one,' he says, _these_ words\ndo not contradict any sort of mutual influence that may be proposed.\nIf _a_ and _b_ are 'one,' and the one changes, _a_ and _b_ of course\nmust co-ordinately change. What under the old name they couldn't do,\nthey now have license to do under the new name.\nBut I ask you whether giving the name of 'one' to the former 'many'\nmakes us really understand the modus operandi of interaction any\nbetter. We have now given verbal permission to the many to change all\ntogether, if they can; we have removed a verbal impossibility\nand substituted a verbal possibility, but the new name, with the\npossibility it suggests, tells us nothing of the actual process by\nwhich real things that are one can and do change at all. In point\nof fact abstract oneness as such _doesn't_ change, neither has it\nparts--any more than abstract independence as such interacts. But then\nneither abstract oneness nor abstract independence _exists_; only\nconcrete real things exist, which add to these properties the other\nproperties which they possess, to make up what we call their total\nnature. To construe any one of their abstract names as _making their\ntotal nature impossible_ is a misuse of the function of naming. The\nreal way of rescue from the abstract consequences of one name is not\nto fly to an opposite name, equally abstract, but rather to correct\nthe first name by qualifying adjectives that restore some concreteness\nto the case. Don't take your 'independence' _simpliciter_, as Lotze\ndoes, take it _secundum quid_. Only when we know what the process of\ninteraction literally and concretely _consists_ in can we tell whether\nbeings independent _in definite respects_, distinct, for example, in\norigin, separate in place, different in kind, etc., can or cannot\ninteract.\n_The treating of a name as excluding from the fact named what the\nname's definition fails positively to include, is what I call\n'vicious intellectualism_.' Later I shall have more to say about this\nintellectualism, but that Lotze's argument is tainted by it I hardly\nthink we can deny. As well might you contend (to use an instance from\nSigwart) that a person whom you have once called an 'equestrian' is\nthereby forever made unable to walk on his own feet.\nI almost feel as if I should apologize for criticising such subtle\narguments in rapid lectures of this kind. The criticisms have to be as\nabstract as the arguments, and in exposing their unreality, take\non such an unreal sound themselves that a hearer not nursed in the\nintellectualist atmosphere knows not which of them to accuse. But\n_le vin est vers\u00e9, il faut le boire_, and I must cite a couple more\ninstances before I stop.\nIf we are empiricists and go from parts to wholes, we believe that\nbeings may first exist and feed so to speak on their own existence,\nand then secondarily become known to one another. But philosophers of\nthe absolute tell us that such independence of being from being known\nwould, if once admitted, disintegrate the universe beyond all hope of\nmending. The argument is one of Professor Royce's proofs that the only\nalternative we have is to choose the complete disunion of all things\nor their complete union in the absolute One.\nTake, for instance, the proverb 'a cat may look at a king' and adopt\nthe realistic view that the king's being is independent of the cat's\nwitnessing. This assumption, which amounts to saying that it need make\nno essential difference to the royal object whether the feline subject\ncognizes him or not, that the cat may look away from him or may even\nbe annihilated, and the king remain unchanged,--this assumption, I\nsay, is considered by my ingenious colleague to lead to the absurd\npractical consequence that the two beings _can_ never later acquire\nany possible linkages or connexions, but must remain eternally as if\nin different worlds. For suppose any connexion whatever to ensue, this\nconnexion would simply be a third being additional to the cat and the\nking, which would itself have to be linked to both by additional links\nbefore it could connect them, and so on _ad infinitum_, the argument,\nyou see, being the same as Lotze's about how _a_'s influence does its\ninfluencing when it influences _b_.\nIn Royce's own words, if the king can be without the cat knowing him,\nthen king and cat 'can have no common features, no ties, no true\nrelations; they are separated, each from the other, by absolutely\nimpassable chasms. They can never come to get either ties or community\nof nature; they are not in the same space, nor in the same time, nor\nin the same natural or spiritual order.'[7] They form in short two\nunrelated universes,--which is the _reductio ad absurdum_ required.\nTo escape this preposterous state of things we must accordingly revoke\nthe original hypothesis. The king and the cat are not indifferent to\neach other in the way supposed. But if not in that way, then in no\nway, for connexion in that way carries connexion in other ways; so\nthat, pursuing the reverse line of reasoning, we end with the\nabsolute itself as the smallest fact that can exist. Cat and king are\nco-involved, they are a single fact in two names, they can never have\nbeen absent from each other, and they are both equally co-implicated\nwith all the other facts of which the universe consists.\nProfessor Royce's proof that whoso admits the cat's witnessing the\nking at all must thereupon admit the integral absolute, may be briefly\nput as follows:--\nFirst, to know the king, the cat must intend _that_ king, must somehow\npass over and lay hold of him individually and specifically. The cat's\nidea, in short, must transcend the cat's own separate mind and somehow\ninclude the king, for were the king utterly outside and independent of\nthe cat, the cat's pure other, the beast's mind could touch the king\nin no wise. This makes the cat much less distinct from the king than\nwe had at first na\u00efvely supposed. There must be some prior continuity\nbetween them, which continuity Royce interprets idealistically as\nmeaning a higher mind that owns them both as objects, and owning them\ncan also own any relation, such as the supposed witnessing, that may\nobtain between them. Taken purely pluralistically, neither of them can\nown any part of a _between_, because, so taken, each is supposed shut\nup to itself: the fact of a _between_ thus commits us to a higher\nknower.\nBut the higher knower that knows the two beings we start with proves\nto be the same knower that knows everything else. For assume any third\nbeing, the queen, say, and as the cat knew the king, so let the king\nknow his queen, and let this second knowledge, by the same reasoning,\nrequire a higher knower as its presupposition. That knower of the\nking's knowing must, it is now contended, be the same higher knower\nthat was required for the cat's knowing; for if you suppose otherwise,\nyou have no longer the _same king_. This may not seem immediately\nobvious, but if you follow the intellectualistic logic employed in all\nthese reasonings, I don't see how you can escape the admission. If it\nbe true that the independent or indifferent cannot be related, for\nthe abstract words 'independent' or 'indifferent' as such imply no\nrelation, then it is just as true that the king known by the cat\ncannot be the king that knows the queen, for taken merely 'as such,'\nthe abstract term 'what the cat knows' and the abstract term 'what\nknows the queen' are logically distinct. The king thus logically\nbreaks into two kings, with nothing to connect them, until a higher\nknower is introduced to recognize them as the self-same king concerned\nin any previous acts of knowledge which he may have brought about.\nThis he can do because he possesses all the terms as his own objects\nand can treat them as he will. Add any fourth or fifth term, and you\nget a like result, and so on, until at last an all-owning knower,\notherwise called the absolute, is reached. The co-implicated\n'through-and-through' world of monism thus stands proved by\nirrefutable logic, and all pluralism appears as absurd.\nThe reasoning is pleasing from its ingenuity, and it is almost a pity\nthat so straight a bridge from abstract logic to concrete fact should\nnot bear our weight. To have the alternative forced upon us of\nadmitting either finite things each cut off from all relation with\nits environment, or else of accepting the integral absolute with no\nenvironment and all relations packed within itself, would be too\ndelicious a simplification. But the purely verbal character of the\noperation is undisguised. Because the _names_ of finite things and\ntheir relations are disjoined, it doesn't follow that the realities\nnamed need a _deus ex machina_ from on high to conjoin them. The same\nthings disjoined in one respect _appear_ as conjoined in another.\nNaming the disjunction doesn't debar us from also naming the\nconjunction in a later modifying statement, for the two are absolutely\nco-ordinate elements in the finite tissue of experience. When at\nAthens it was found self-contradictory that a boy could be both tall\nand short (tall namely in respect of a child, short in respect of a\nman), the absolute had not yet been thought of, but it might just as\nwell have been invoked by Socrates as by Lotze or Royce, as a relief\nfrom his peculiar intellectualistic difficulty.\nEverywhere we find rationalists using the same kind of reasoning. The\nprimal whole which is their vision must be there not only as a\nfact but as a logical necessity. It must be the minimum that can\nexist--either that absolute whole is there, or there is absolutely\nnothing. The logical proof alleged of the irrationality of supposing\notherwise, is that you can deny the whole only in words that\nimplicitly assert it. If you say 'parts,' of _what_ are they parts? If\nyou call them a 'many,' that very word unifies them. If you suppose\nthem unrelated in any particular respect, that 'respect' connects\nthem; and so on. In short you fall into hopeless contradiction. You\nmust stay either at one extreme or the other.[8] 'Partly this and\npartly that,' partly rational, for instance, and partly irrational,\nis no admissible description of the world. If rationality be in it at\nall, it must be in it throughout; if irrationality be in it anywhere,\nthat also must pervade it throughout. It must be wholly rational or\nwholly irrational, pure universe or pure multiverse or nulliverse; and\nreduced to this violent alternative, no one's choice ought long to\nremain doubtful. The individual absolute, with its parts co-implicated\nthrough and through, so that there is nothing in any part by which\nany other part can remain inwardly unaffected, is the only rational\nsupposition. Connexions of an external sort, by which the many became\nmerely continuous instead of being consubstantial, would be an\nirrational supposition.\nMr. Bradley is the pattern champion of this philosophy _in extremis_,\nas one might call it, for he shows an intolerance to pluralism so\nextreme that I fancy few of his readers have been able fully to share\nit. His reasoning exemplifies everywhere what I call the vice of\nintellectualism, for abstract terms are used by him as positively\nexcluding all that their definition fails to include. Some Greek\nsophists could deny that we may say that man is good, for man, they\nsaid, means only man, and good means only good, and the word _is_\ncan't be construed to identify such disparate meanings. Mr. Bradley\nrevels in the same type of argument. No adjective can rationally\nqualify a substantive, he thinks, for if distinct from the\nsubstantive, it can't be united with it; and if not distinct, there is\nonly one thing there, and nothing left to unite. Our whole pluralistic\nprocedure in using subjects and predicates as we do is fundamentally\nirrational, an example of the desperation of our finite intellectual\nestate, infected and undermined as that is by the separatist\ndiscursive forms which are our only categories, but which absolute\nreality must somehow absorb into its unity and overcome.\nReaders of 'Appearance and reality' will remember how Mr. Bradley\nsuffers from a difficulty identical with that to which Lotze and Royce\nfall a prey--how shall an influence influence? how shall a relation\nrelate? Any conjunctive relation between two phenomenal experiences\n_a_ and _b_ must, in the intellectualist philosophy of these authors,\nbe itself a third entity; and as such, instead of bridging the one\noriginal chasm, it can only create two smaller chasms, each to be\nfreshly bridged. Instead of hooking _a_ to _b_, it needs itself to be\nhooked by a fresh relation _r\u0092_ to _a_ and by another _r\u0094_ to _b_.\nThese new relations are but two more entities which themselves require\nto be hitched in turn by four still newer relations--so behold the\nvertiginous _regressus ad infinitum_ in full career.\nSince a _regressus ad infinitum_ is deemed absurd, the notion that\nrelations come 'between' their terms must be given up. No mere\nexternal go-between can logically connect. What occurs must be more\nintimate. The hooking must be a penetration, a possession. The\nrelation must _involve_ the terms, each term must involve _it_, and\nmerging thus their being in it, they must somehow merge their being in\neach other, tho, as they seem still phenomenally so separate, we can\nnever conceive exactly how it is that they are inwardly one. The\nabsolute, however, must be supposed able to perform the unifying feat\nin his own inscrutable fashion.\nIn old times, whenever a philosopher was assailed for some\nparticularly tough absurdity in his system, he was wont to parry the\nattack by the argument from the divine omnipotence. 'Do you mean to\nlimit God's power?' he would reply: 'do you mean to say that God could\nnot, if he would, do this or that?' This retort was supposed to close\nthe mouths of all objectors of properly decorous mind. The functions\nof the bradleian absolute are in this particular identical with those\nof the theistic God. Suppositions treated as too absurd to pass muster\nin the finite world which we inhabit, the absolute must be able to\nmake good 'somehow' in his ineffable way. First we hear Mr. Bradley\nconvicting things of absurdity; next, calling on the absolute to vouch\nfor them _quand m\u00eame_. Invoked for no other duty, that duty it must\nand shall perform.\nThe strangest discontinuity of our world of appearance with the\nsupposed world of absolute reality is asserted both by Bradley and\nby Royce; and both writers, the latter with great ingenuity, seek to\nsoften the violence of the jolt. But it remains violent all the same,\nand is felt to be so by most readers. Whoever feels the violence\nstrongly sees as on a diagram in just what the peculiarity of all this\nphilosophy of the absolute consists. First, there is a healthy faith\nthat the world must be rational and self-consistent. 'All science, all\nreal knowledge, all experience presuppose,' as Mr. Ritchie writes, 'a\ncoherent universe.' Next, we find a loyal clinging to the rationalist\nbelief that sense-data and their associations are incoherent, and that\nonly in substituting a conceptual order for their order can truth\nbe found. Third, the substituted conceptions are treated\nintellectualistically, that is as mutually exclusive and\ndiscontinuous, so that the first innocent continuity of the flow of\nsense-experience is shattered for us without any higher conceptual\ncontinuity taking its place. Finally, since this broken state of\nthings is intolerable, the absolute _deus ex machina_ is called on to\nmend it in his own way, since we cannot mend it in ours.\nAny other picture than this of post-kantian absolutism I am unable\nto frame. I see the intellectualistic criticism destroying the\nimmediately given coherence of the phenomenal world, but unable to\nmake its own conceptual substitutes cohere, and I see the resort to\nthe absolute for a coherence of a higher type. The situation has\ndramatic liveliness, but it is inwardly incoherent throughout, and the\nquestion inevitably comes up whether a mistake may not somewhere have\ncrept in in the process that has brought it about. May not the remedy\nlie rather in revising the intellectualist criticism than in first\nadopting it and then trying to undo its consequences by an arbitrary\nact of faith in an unintelligible agent. May not the flux of sensible\nexperience itself contain a rationality that has been overlooked,\nso that the real remedy would consist in harking back to it more\nintelligently, and not in advancing in the opposite direction away\nfrom it and even away beyond the intellectualist criticism that\ndisintegrates it, to the pseudo-rationality of the supposed absolute\npoint of view. I myself believe that this is the real way to keep\nrationality in the world, and that the traditional rationalism has\nalways been facing in the wrong direction. I hope in the end to make\nyou share, or at any rate respect, this belief, but there is much to\ntalk of before we get to that point.\nI employed the word 'violent' just now in describing the dramatic\nsituation in which it pleases the philosophy of the absolute to make\nits camp. I don't see how any one can help being struck in absolutist\nwritings by that curious tendency to fly to violent extremes of which\nI have already said a word. The universe must be rational; well\nand good; but _how_ rational? in what sense of that eulogistic but\nambiguous word?--this would seem to be the next point to bring up.\nThere are surely degrees in rationality that might be discriminated\nand described. Things can be consistent or coherent in very diverse\nways. But no more in its conception of rationality than in its\nconception of relations can the monistic mind suffer the notion of\nmore or less. Rationality is one and indivisible: if not rational\nthus indivisibly, the universe must be completely irrational, and no\nshadings or mixtures or compromises can obtain. Mr. McTaggart writes,\nin discussing the notion of a mixture: 'The two principles, of\nrationality and irrationality, to which the universe is then referred,\nwill have to be absolutely separate and independent. For if there were\nany common unity to which they should be referred, it would be that\nunity and not its two manifestations which would be the ultimate\nexplanation ... and the theory, having thus become monistic,'[9] would\nresolve itself into the same alternative once more: is the single\nprinciple rational through and through or not?\n'Can a plurality of reals be possible?' asks Mr. Bradley, and answers,\n'No, impossible.' For it would mean a number of beings not dependent\non each other, and this independence their plurality would contradict.\nFor to be 'many' is to be related, the word having no meaning unless\nthe units are somehow taken together, and it is impossible to take\nthem in a sort of unreal void, so they must belong to a larger\nreality, and so carry the essence of the units beyond their proper\nselves, into a whole which possesses unity and is a larger system.[10]\nEither absolute independence or absolute mutual dependence--this,\nthen, is the only alternative allowed by these thinkers. Of course\n'independence,' if absolute, would be preposterous, so the only\nconclusion allowable is that, in Ritchie's words, 'every single event\nis ultimately related to every other, and determined by the whole\nto which it belongs.' The whole complete block-universe\nthrough-and-through, therefore, or no universe at all!\nProfessor Taylor is so _na\u00eff_ in this habit of thinking only in\nextremes that he charges the pluralists with cutting the ground from\nunder their own feet in not consistently following it themselves. What\npluralists say is that a universe really connected loosely, after the\npattern of our daily experience, is possible, and that for certain\nreasons it is the hypothesis to be preferred. What Professor Taylor\nthinks they naturally must or should say is that any other sort of\nuniverse is logically impossible, and that a totality of things\ninterrelated like the world of the monists is not an hypothesis that\ncan be seriously thought out at all.[11]\nMeanwhile no sensible pluralist ever flies or wants to fly to this\ndogmatic extreme.\nIf chance is spoken of as an ingredient of the universe, absolutists\ninterpret it to mean that double sevens are as likely to be thrown out\nof a dice box as double sixes are. If free-will is spoken of, that\nmust mean that an english general is as likely to eat his prisoners\nto-day as a Maori chief was a hundred years ago. It is as likely--I am\nusing Mr. McTaggart's examples--that a majority of Londoners will\nburn themselves alive to-morrow as that they will partake of food, as\nlikely that I shall be hanged for brushing my hair as for committing\na murder,[12] and so forth, through various suppositions that no\nindeterminist ever sees real reason to make.\nThis habit of thinking only in the most violent extremes reminds me\nof what Mr. Wells says of the current objections to socialism, in his\nwonderful little book, 'New worlds for old.' The commonest vice of the\nhuman mind is its disposition to see everything as yes or no, as black\nor white, its incapacity for discrimination of intermediate shades.\nSo the critics agree to some hard and fast impossible definition of\nsocialism, and extract absurdities from it as a conjurer gets rabbits\nfrom a hat. Socialism abolishes property, abolishes the family, and\nthe rest. The method, Mr. Wells continues, is always the same: It\nis to assume that whatever the socialist postulates as desirable is\nwanted without limit of qualification,--for socialist read pluralist\nand the parallel holds good,--it is to imagine that whatever proposal\nis made by him is to be carried out by uncontrolled monomaniacs, and\nso to make a picture of the socialist dream which can be presented to\nthe simple-minded person in doubt--'This is socialism'--or pluralism,\nas the case may be. 'Surely!--SURELY! you don't want _this!_'\nHow often have I been replied to, when expressing doubts of the\nlogical necessity of the absolute, of flying to the opposite extreme:\n'But surely, SURELY there must be _some_ connexion among things!' As\nif I must necessarily be an uncontrolled monomanic insanely denying\nany connexion whatever. The whole question revolves in very truth\nabout the word 'some.' Radical empiricism and pluralism stand out for\nthe legitimacy of the notion of _some_: each part of the world is in\nsome ways connected, in some other ways not connected with its other\nparts, and the ways can be discriminated, for many of them are\nobvious, and their differences are obvious to view. Absolutism, on its\nside, seems to hold that 'some' is a category ruinously infected\nwith self-contradictoriness, and that the only categories inwardly\nconsistent and therefore pertinent to reality are 'all' and 'none.'\nThe question runs into the still more general one with which Mr.\nBradley and later writers of the monistic school have made us\nabundantly familiar--the question, namely, whether all the relations\nwith other things, possible to a being, are pre-included in its\nintrinsic nature and enter into its essence, or whether, in respect to\nsome of these relations, it can _be_ without reference to them, and,\nif it ever does enter into them, do so adventitiously and as it\nwere by an after-thought. This is the great question as to whether\n'external' relations can exist. They seem to, undoubtedly. My\nmanuscript, for example, is 'on' the desk. The relation of being 'on'\ndoesn't seem to implicate or involve in any way the inner meaning\nof the manuscript or the inner structure of the desk--these objects\nengage in it only by their outsides, it seems only a temporary\naccident in their respective histories. Moreover, the 'on' fails to\nappear to our senses as one of those unintelligible 'betweens' that\nhave to be separately hooked on the terms they pretend to connect.\nAll this innocent sense-appearance, however, we are told, cannot pass\nmuster in the eyes of reason. It is a tissue of self-contradiction\nwhich only the complete absorption of the desk and the manuscript into\nthe higher unity of a more absolute reality can overcome.\nThe reasoning by which this conclusion is supported is too subtle and\ncomplicated to be properly dealt with in a public lecture, and you\nwill thank me for not inviting you to consider it at all.[13] I feel\nthe more free to pass it by now as I think that the cursory account of\nthe absolutistic attitude which I have already given is sufficient for\nour present purpose, and that my own verdict on the philosophy of\nthe absolute as 'not proven'--please observe that I go no farther\nnow--need not be backed by argument at every special point. Flanking\noperations are less costly and in some ways more effective than\nfrontal attacks. Possibly you will yourselves think after hearing my\nremaining lectures that the alternative of an universe absolutely\nrational or absolutely irrational is forced and strained, and that\na _via media_ exists which some of you may agree with me is to\nbe preferred. _Some_ rationality certainly does characterize our\nuniverse; and, weighing one kind with another, we may deem that the\nincomplete kinds that appear are on the whole as acceptable as\nthe through-and-through sort of rationality on which the monistic\nsystematizers insist.\nAll the said systematizers who have written since Hegel have owed\ntheir inspiration largely to him. Even when they have found no use\nfor his particular triadic dialectic, they have drawn confidence\nand courage from his authoritative and conquering tone. I have said\nnothing about Hegel in this lecture, so I must repair the omission in\nthe next.\nLECTURE III\nHEGEL AND HIS METHOD\nDirectly or indirectly, that strange and powerful genius Hegel has\ndone more to strengthen idealistic pantheism in thoughtful circles\nthan all other influences put together. I must talk a little about him\nbefore drawing my final conclusions about the cogency of the arguments\nfor the absolute. In no philosophy is the fact that a philosopher's\nvision and the technique he uses in proof of it are two different\nthings more palpably evident than in Hegel. The vision in his case\nwas that of a world in which reason holds all things in solution and\naccounts for all the irrationality that superficially appears by\ntaking it up as a 'moment' into itself. This vision was so intense in\nHegel, and the tone of authority with which he spoke from out of the\nmidst of it was so weighty, that the impression he made has never been\neffaced. Once dilated to the scale of the master's eye, the disciples'\nsight could not contract to any lesser prospect. The technique which\nHegel used to prove his vision was the so-called dialectic method, but\nhere his fortune has been quite contrary. Hardly a recent disciple has\nfelt his particular applications of the method to be satisfactory.\nMany have let them drop entirely, treating them rather as a sort of\nprovisional stop-gap, symbolic of what might some day prove possible\nof execution, but having no literal cogency or value now. Yet these\nvery same disciples hold to the vision itself as a revelation that can\nnever pass away. The case is curious and worthy of our study.\nIt is still more curious in that these same disciples, altho they are\nusually willing to abandon any particular instance of the dialectic\nmethod to its critics, are unshakably sure that in some shape the\ndialectic method is the key to truth. What, then, is the dialectic\nmethod? It is itself a part of the hegelian vision or intuition, and\na part that finds the strongest echo in empiricism and common sense.\nGreat injustice is done to Hegel by treating him as primarily a\nreasoner. He is in reality a na\u00efvely observant man, only beset with a\nperverse preference for the use of technical and logical jargon. He\nplants himself in the empirical flux of things and gets the impression\nof what happens. His mind is in very truth _impressionistic_; and his\nthought, when once you put yourself at the animating centre of it, is\nthe easiest thing in the world to catch the pulse of and to follow.\nAny author is easy if you can catch the centre of his vision. From\nthe centre in Hegel come those towering sentences of his that are\ncomparable only to Luther's, as where, speaking of the ontological\nproof of God's existence from the concept of him as the _ens\nperfectissimum_ to which no attribute can be lacking, he says: 'It\nwould be strange if the Notion, the very heart of the mind, or, in\na word, the concrete totality we call God, were not rich enough\nto embrace so poor a category as Being, the very poorest and most\nabstract of all--for nothing can be more insignificant than Being.'\nBut if Hegel's central thought is easy to catch, his abominable habits\nof speech make his application of it to details exceedingly difficult\nto follow. His passion for the slipshod in the way of sentences,\nhis unprincipled playing fast and loose with terms; his dreadful\nvocabulary, calling what completes a thing its 'negation,' for\nexample; his systematic refusal to let you know whether he is talking\nlogic or physics or psychology, his whole deliberately adopted policy\nof ambiguity and vagueness, in short: all these things make his\npresent-day readers wish to tear their hair--or his--out in\ndesperation. Like Byron's corsair, he has left a name 'to other times,\nlinked with one virtue and a thousand crimes.'\nThe virtue was the vision, which was really in two parts. The first\npart was that reason is all-inclusive, the second was that things\nare 'dialectic.' Let me say a word about this second part of Hegel's\nvision.\nThe impression that any _na\u00eff_ person gets who plants himself\ninnocently in the flux of things is that things are off their balance.\nWhatever equilibriums our finite experiences attain to are but\nprovisional. Martinique volcanoes shatter our wordsworthian\nequilibrium with nature. Accidents, either moral, mental, or physical,\nbreak up the slowly built-up equilibriums men reach in family life\nand in their civic and professional relations. Intellectual enigmas\nfrustrate our scientific systems, and the ultimate cruelty of the\nuniverse upsets our religious attitudes and outlooks. Of no special\nsystem of good attained does the universe recognize the value as\nsacred. Down it tumbles, over it goes, to feed the ravenous appetite\nfor destruction, of the larger system of history in which it stood\nfor a moment as a landing-place and stepping-stone. This dogging of\neverything by its negative, its fate, its undoing, this perpetual\nmoving on to something future which shall supersede the present,\nthis is the hegelian intuition of the essential provisionality, and\nconsequent unreality, of everything empirical and finite. Take any\nconcrete finite thing and try to hold it fast. You cannot, for so\nheld, it proves not to be concrete at all, but an arbitrary extract or\nabstract which you have made from the remainder of empirical reality.\nThe rest of things invades and overflows both it and you together,\nand defeats your rash attempt. Any partial view whatever of the world\ntears the part out of its relations, leaves out some truth concerning\nit, is untrue of it, falsifies it. The full truth about anything\ninvolves more than that thing. In the end nothing less than the whole\nof everything can be the truth of anything at all.\nTaken so far, and taken in the rough, Hegel is not only harmless, but\naccurate. There is a dialectic movement in things, if such it please\nyou to call it, one that the whole constitution of concrete life\nestablishes; but it is one that can be described and accounted for in\nterms of the pluralistic vision of things far more naturally than in\nthe monistic terms to which Hegel finally reduced it. Pluralistic\nempiricism knows that everything is in an environment, a surrounding\nworld of other things, and that if you leave it to work there it will\ninevitably meet with friction and opposition from its neighbors. Its\nrivals and enemies will destroy it unless it can buy them off by\ncompromising some part of its original pretensions.\nBut Hegel saw this undeniable characteristic of the world we live in\nin a non-empirical light. Let the _mental idea_ of the thing work in\nyour thought all alone, he fancied, and just the same consequences\nwill follow. It will be negated by the opposite ideas that dog it,\nand can survive only by entering, along with them, into some kind\nof treaty. This treaty will be an instance of the so-called 'higher\nsynthesis' of everything with its negative; and Hegel's originality\nlay in transporting the process from the sphere of percepts to that of\nconcepts and treating it as the universal method by which every kind\nof life, logical, physical, or psychological, is mediated. Not to the\nsensible facts as such, then, did Hegel point for the secret of what\nkeeps existence going, but rather to the conceptual way of treating\nthem. Concepts were not in his eyes the static self-contained things\nthat previous logicians had supposed, but were germinative, and passed\nbeyond themselves into each other by what he called their immanent\ndialectic. In ignoring each other as they do, they virtually exclude\nand deny each other, he thought, and thus in a manner introduce each\nother. So the dialectic logic, according to him, had to supersede the\n'logic of identity' in which, since Aristotle, all Europe had been\nbrought up.\nThis view of concepts is Hegel's revolutionary performance; but so\nstudiously vague and ambiguous are all his expressions of it that one\ncan hardly tell whether it is the concepts as such, or the sensible\nexperiences and elements conceived, that Hegel really means to work\nwith. The only thing that is certain is that whatever you may say of\nhis procedure, some one will accuse you of misunderstanding it. I make\nno claim to understanding it, I treat it merely impressionistically.\nSo treating it, I regret that he should have called it by the name of\nlogic. Clinging as he did to the vision of a really living world, and\nrefusing to be content with a chopped-up intellectualist picture\nof it, it is a pity that he should have adopted the very word that\nintellectualism had already pre-empted. But he clung fast to the old\nrationalist contempt for the immediately given world of sense and all\nits squalid particulars, and never tolerated the notion that the form\nof philosophy might be empirical only. His own system had to be a\nproduct of eternal reason, so the word 'logic,' with its suggestions\nof coercive necessity, was the only word he could find natural. He\npretended therefore to be using the _a priori_ method, and to be\nworking by a scanty equipment of ancient logical terms--position,\nnegation, reflection, universal, particular, individual, and the like.\nBut what he really worked by was his own empirical perceptions, which\nexceeded and overflowed his miserably insufficient logical categories\nin every instance of their use.\nWhat he did with the category of negation was his most original\nstroke. The orthodox opinion is that you can advance logically through\nthe field of concepts only by going from the same to the same. Hegel\nfelt deeply the sterility of this law of conceptual thought; he\nsaw that in a fashion negation also relates things; and he had the\nbrilliant idea of transcending the ordinary logic by treating advance\nfrom the different to the different as if it were also a necessity of\nthought. 'The so-called maxim of identity,' he wrote, 'is supposed to\nbe accepted by the consciousness of every one. But the language which\nsuch a law demands, \"a planet is a planet, magnetism is magnetism,\nmind is mind,\" deserves to be called silliness. No mind either speaks\nor thinks or forms conceptions in accordance with this law, and no\nexistence of any kind whatever conforms to it. We must never view\nidentity as abstract identity, to the exclusion of all difference.\nThat is the touchstone for distinguishing all bad philosophy from what\nalone deserves the name of philosophy. If thinking were no more than\nregistering abstract identities, it would be a most superfluous\nperformance. Things and concepts are identical with themselves only in\nso far as at the same time they involve distinction.'[1]\nThe distinction that Hegel has in mind here is naturally in the first\ninstance distinction from all other things or concepts. But in his\nhands this quickly develops into contradiction of them, and finally,\nreflected back upon itself, into self-contradiction; and the immanent\nself-contradictoriness of all finite concepts thenceforth becomes the\npropulsive logical force that moves the world.[2] 'Isolate a thing\nfrom all its relations,' says Dr. Edward Caird,[3] expounding Hegel,\n'and try to assert it by itself; you find that it has negated itself\nas well as its relations. The thing in itself is nothing.' Or, to\nquote Hegel's own words: 'When we suppose an existent A, and another,\nB, B is at first defined as the other. But A is just as much the other\nof B. Both are others in the same fashion.... \"Other\" is the other by\nitself, therefore the other of every other, consequently the other of\nitself, the simply unlike itself, the self-negator, the self-alterer,'\netc.[4] Hegel writes elsewhere: 'The finite, as implicitly other than\nwhat it is, is forced to surrender its own immediate or natural being,\nand to turn suddenly into its opposite.... Dialectic is the universal\nand irresistible power before which nothing can stay.... _Summum jus,\nsumma injuria_--to drive an abstract right to excess is to commit\ninjustice.... Extreme anarchy and extreme despotism lead to one\nanother. Pride comes before a fall. Too much wit outwits itself. Joy\nbrings tears, melancholy a sardonic smile.'[5] To which one well\nmight add that most human institutions, by the purely technical and\nprofessional manner in which they come to be administered, end by\nbecoming obstacles to the very purposes which their founders had in\nview.\nOnce catch well the knack of this scheme of thought and you are lucky\nif you ever get away from it. It is all you can see. Let any one\npronounce anything, and your feeling of a contradiction being implied\nbecomes a habit, almost a motor habit in some persons who symbolize by\na stereotyped gesture the position, sublation, and final reinstatement\ninvolved. If you say 'two' or 'many,' your speech betrayeth you, for\nthe very name collects them into one. If you express doubt, your\nexpression contradicts its content, for the doubt itself is not\ndoubted but affirmed. If you say 'disorder,' what is that but a\ncertain bad kind of order? if you say 'indetermination,' you are\ndetermining just _that_. If you say 'nothing but the unexpected\nhappens,' the unexpected becomes what you expect. If you say 'all\nthings are relative,' to what is the all of them itself relative? If\nyou say 'no more,' you have said more already, by implying a region\nin which no more is found; to know a limit as such is consequently\nalready to have got beyond it; And so forth, throughout as many\nexamples as one cares to cite.\nWhatever you posit appears thus as one-sided, and negates its other,\nwhich, being equally one-sided, negates _it_; and, since this\nsituation remains unstable, the two contradictory terms have together,\naccording to Hegel, to engender a higher truth of which they both\nappear as indispensable members, mutually mediating aspects of that\nhigher concept of situation in thought.\nEvery higher total, however provisional and relative, thus reconciles\nthe contradictions which its parts, abstracted from it, prove\nimplicitly to contain. Rationalism, you remember, is what I called the\nway of thinking that methodically subordinates parts to wholes, so\nHegel here is rationalistic through and through. The only whole by\nwhich _all_ contradictions are reconciled is for him the absolute\nwhole of wholes, the all-inclusive reason to which Hegel himself gave\nthe name of the absolute Idea, but which I shall continue to call 'the\nabsolute' purely and simply, as I have done hitherto.\nEmpirical instances of the way in which higher unities reconcile\ncontradictions are innumerable, so here again Hegel's vision, taken\nmerely impressionistically, agrees with countless facts. Somehow life\ndoes, out of its total resources, find ways of satisfying opposites\nat once. This is precisely the paradoxical aspect which much of our\ncivilization presents. Peace we secure by armaments, liberty by laws\nand constitutions; simplicity and naturalness are the consummate\nresult of artificial breeding and training; health, strength, and\nwealth are increased only by lavish use, expense, and wear. Our\nmistrust of mistrust engenders our commercial system of credit; our\ntolerance of anarchistic and revolutionary utterances is the only way\nof lessening their danger; our charity has to say no to beggars in\norder not to defeat its own desires; the true epicurean has to observe\ngreat sobriety; the way to certainty lies through radical doubt;\nvirtue signifies not innocence but the knowledge of sin and its\novercoming; by obeying nature, we command her, etc. The ethical and\nthe religious life are full of such contradictions held in solution.\nYou hate your enemy?--well, forgive him, and thereby heap coals of\nfire on his head; to realize yourself, renounce yourself; to save your\nsoul, first lose it; in short, die to live.\nFrom such massive examples one easily generalizes Hegel's vision.\nRoughly, his 'dialectic' picture is a fair account of a good deal of\nthe world. It sounds paradoxical, but whenever you once place yourself\nat the point of view; of any higher synthesis, you see exactly how\nit does in a fashion take up opposites into itself. As an example,\nconsider the conflict between our carnivorous appetites and hunting\ninstincts and the sympathy with animals which our refinement is\nbringing in its train. We have found how to reconcile these opposites\nmost effectively by establishing game-laws and close seasons and by\nkeeping domestic herds. The creatures preserved thus are preserved for\nthe sake of slaughter, truly, but if not preserved for that reason,\nnot one of them would be alive at all. Their will to live and our\nwill to kill them thus harmoniously combine in this peculiar higher\nsynthesis of domestication.\nMerely as a reporter of certain empirical aspects of the actual,\nHegel, then, is great and true. But he aimed at being something far\ngreater than an empirical reporter, so I must say something about that\nessential aspect of his thought. Hegel was dominated by the notion of\na truth that should prove incontrovertible, binding on every one,\nand certain, which should be _the_ truth, one, indivisible, eternal,\nobjective, and necessary, to which all our particular thinking\nmust lead as to its consummation. This is the dogmatic ideal,\nthe postulate, uncriticised, undoubted, and unchallenged, of all\nrationalizers in philosophy. '_I have never doubted_,' a recent Oxford\nwriter says, that truth is universal and single and timeless, a single\ncontent or significance, one and whole and complete.[6] Advance in\nthinking, in the hegelian universe, has, in short, to proceed by the\napodictic words _must be_ rather than by those inferior hypothetic\nwords _may be_, which are all that empiricists can use.\nNow Hegel found that his idea of an immanent movement through\nthe field of concepts by way of 'dialectic' negation played most\nbeautifully into the hands of this rationalistic demand for something\nabsolute and _inconcussum_ in the way of truth. It is easy to see how.\nIf you affirm anything, for example that A is, and simply leave the\nmatter thus, you leave it at the mercy of any one who may supervene\nand say 'not A, but B is.' If he does say so, your statement doesn't\nrefute him, it simply contradicts him, just as his contradicts you.\nThe only way of making your affirmation about A _self-securing_ is by\ngetting it into a form which will by implication negate all possible\nnegations in advance. The mere absence of negation is not enough; it\nmust be present, but present with its fangs drawn. What you posit as A\nmust already have cancelled the alternative or made it innocuous, by\nhaving negated it in advance. Double negation is the only form of\naffirmation that fully plays into the hands of the dogmatic ideal.\nSimply and innocently affirmative statements are good enough for\nempiricists, but unfit for rationalist use, lying open as they do to\nevery accidental contradictor, and exposed to every puff of doubt.\nThe _final_ truth must be something to which there is no imaginable\nalternative, because it contains all its possible alternatives inside\nof itself as moments already taken account of and overcome. Whatever\ninvolves its own alternatives as elements of itself is, in a phrase\noften repeated, its 'own other,' made so by the _methode der absoluten\nnegativit\u00e4t_.\nFormally, this scheme of an organism of truth that has already fed as\nit were on its own liability to death, so that, death once dead\nfor it, there's no more dying then, is the very fulfilment of the\nrationalistic aspiration. That one and only whole, with all its\nparts involved in it, negating and making one another impossible if\nabstracted and taken singly, but necessitating and holding one another\nin place if the whole of them be taken integrally, is the literal\nideal sought after; it is the very diagram and picture of that notion\nof _the_ truth with no outlying alternative, to which nothing can be\nadded, nor from it anything withdrawn, and all variations from which\nare absurd, which so dominates the human imagination. Once we have\ntaken in the features of this diagram that so successfully solves\nthe world-old problem, the older ways of proving the necessity of\njudgments cease to give us satisfaction. Hegel's way we think must\nbe the right way. The true must be essentially the self-reflecting\nself-contained recurrent, that which secures itself by including its\nown other and negating it; that makes a spherical system with no loose\nends hanging out for foreignness to get a hold upon; that is forever\nrounded in and closed, not strung along rectilinearly and open at its\nends like that universe of simply collective or additive form which\nHegel calls the world of the bad infinite, and which is all that\nempiricism, starting with simply posited single parts and elements, is\never able to attain to.\nNo one can possibly deny the sublimity of this hegelian conception.\nIt is surely in the grand style, if there be such a thing as a grand\nstyle in philosophy. For us, however, it remains, so far, a merely\nformal and diagrammatic conception; for with the actual content\nof absolute truth, as Hegel materially tries to set it forth, few\ndisciples have been satisfied, and I do not propose to refer at all to\nthe concreter parts of his philosophy. The main thing now is to grasp\nthe generalized vision, and feel the authority of the abstract scheme\nof a statement self-secured by involving double negation. Absolutists\nwho make no use of Hegel's own technique are really working by his\nmethod. You remember the proofs of the absolute which I instanced in\nmy last lecture, Lotze's and Royce's proofs by _reductio ad absurdum_,\nto the effect that any smallest connexion rashly supposed in things\nwill logically work out into absolute union, and any minimal\ndisconnexion into absolute disunion,--these are really arguments\nframed on the hegelian pattern. The truth is that which you implicitly\naffirm in the very attempt to deny it; it is that from which every\nvariation refutes itself by proving self-contradictory. This is the\nsupreme insight of rationalism, and to-day the best _must-be's_ of\nrationalist argumentation are but so many attempts to communicate it\nto the hearer.\nThus, you see, my last lecture and this lecture make connexion again\nand we can consider Hegel and the other absolutists to be supporting\nthe same system. The next point I wish to dwell on is the part played\nby what I have called vicious intellectualism in this wonderful\nsystem's structure.\nRationalism in general thinks it gets the fulness of truth by turning\naway from sensation to conception, conception obviously giving the\nmore universal and immutable picture. Intellectualism in the vicious\nsense I have already defined as the habit of assuming that a concept\n_ex_cludes from any reality conceived by its means everything not\nincluded in the concept's definition. I called such intellectualism\nillegitimate as I found it used in Lotze's, Royce's, and Bradley's\nproofs of the absolute (which absolute I consequently held to be\nnon-proven by their arguments), and I left off by asserting my own\nbelief that a pluralistic and incompletely integrated universe,\ndescribable only by the free use of the word 'some,' is a legitimate\nhypothesis.\nNow Hegel himself, in building up his method of double negation,\noffers the vividest possible example of this vice of intellectualism.\nEvery idea of a finite thing is of course a concept of _that_ thing\nand not a concept of anything else. But Hegel treats this not being a\nconcept of anything else as if it were _equivalent to the concept of\nanything else not being_, or in other words as if it were a denial\nor negation of everything else. Then, as the other things, thus\nimplicitly contradicted by the thing first conceived, also by the same\nlaw contradict _it_, the pulse of dialectic commences to beat and the\nfamous triads begin to grind out the cosmos. If any one finds\nthe process here to be a luminous one, he must be left to the\nillumination, he must remain an undisturbed hegelian. What others feel\nas the intolerable ambiguity, verbosity, and unscrupulousness of the\nmaster's way of deducing things, he will probably ascribe--since\ndivine oracles are notoriously hard to interpret--to the 'difficulty'\nthat habitually accompanies profundity. For my own part, there seems\nsomething grotesque and _saugrenu_ in the pretension of a style so\ndisobedient to the first rules of sound communication between minds,\nto be the authentic mother-tongue of reason, and to keep step more\naccurately than any other style does with the absolute's own ways\nof thinking. I do not therefore take Hegel's technical apparatus\nseriously at all. I regard him rather as one of those numerous\noriginal seers who can never learn how to articulate. His would-be\ncoercive logic counts for nothing in my eyes; but that does not in\nthe least impugn the philosophic importance of his conception of the\nabsolute, if we take it merely hypothetically as one of the great\ntypes of cosmic vision.\nTaken thus hypothetically, I wish to discuss it briefly. But before\ndoing so I must call your attention to an odd peculiarity in the\nhegelian procedure. The peculiarity is one which will come before us\nagain for a final judgment in my seventh lecture, so at present I only\nnote it in passing. Hegel, you remember, considers that the immediate\nfinite data of experience are 'untrue' because they are not their own\nothers. They are negated by what is external to them. The absolute\nis true because it and it only has no external environment, and has\nattained to being its own other. (These words sound queer enough, but\nthose of you who know something of Hegel's text will follow them.)\nGranting his premise that to be true a thing must in some sort be its\nown other, everything hinges on whether he is right in holding that\nthe several pieces of finite experience themselves cannot be said\nto be in any wise _their_ own others. When conceptually or\nintellectualistically treated, they of course cannot be their own\nothers. Every abstract concept as such excludes what it doesn't\ninclude, and if such concepts are adequate substitutes for\nreality's concrete pulses, the latter must square themselves with\nintellectualistic logic, and no one of them in any sense can claim to\nbe its own other. If, however, the conceptual treatment of the flow of\nreality should prove for any good reason to be inadequate and to have\na practical rather than a theoretical or speculative value, then an\nindependent empirical look into the constitution of reality's pulses\nmight possibly show that some of them _are_ their own others, and\nindeed are so in the self-same sense in which the absolute is\nmaintained to be so by Hegel. When we come to my sixth lecture,\non Professor Bergson, I shall in effect defend this very view,\nstrengthening my thesis by his authority. I am unwilling to say\nanything more about the point at this time, and what I have just said\nof it is only a sort of surveyor's note of where our present position\nlies in the general framework of these lectures.\nLet us turn now at last to the great question of fact, _Does the\nabsolute exist or not_? to which all our previous discussion has been\npreliminary. I may sum up that discussion by saying that whether\nthere really be an absolute or not, no one makes himself absurd\nor self-contradictory by doubting or denying it. The charges of\nself-contradiction, where they do not rest on purely verbal reasoning,\nrest on a vicious intellectualism. I will not recapitulate my\ncriticisms. I will simply ask you to change the _venue_, and to\ndiscuss the absolute now as if it were only an open hypothesis. As\nsuch, is it more probable or more improbable?\nBut first of all I must parenthetically ask you to distinguish the\nnotion of the absolute carefully from that of another object with\nwhich it is liable to become heedlessly entangled. That other object\nis the 'God' of common people in their religion, and the creator-God\nof orthodox christian theology. Only thoroughgoing monists or\npantheists believe in the absolute. The God of our popular\nChristianity is but one member of a pluralistic system. He and we\nstand outside of each other, just as the devil, the saints, and the\nangels stand outside of both of us. I can hardly conceive of anything\nmore different from the absolute than the God, say, of David or of\nIsaiah. _That_ God is an essentially finite being _in_ the cosmos,\nnot with the cosmos in him, and indeed he has a very local habitation\nthere, and very one-sided local and personal attachments. If it should\nprove probable that the absolute does not exist, it will not follow in\nthe slightest degree that a God like that of David, Isaiah, or Jesus\nmay not exist, or may not be the most important existence in the\nuniverse for us to acknowledge. I pray you, then, not to confound the\ntwo ideas as you listen to the criticisms I shall have to proffer.\nI hold to the finite God, for reasons which I shall touch on in the\nseventh of these lectures; but I hold that his rival and competitor--I\nfeel almost tempted to say his enemy--the absolute, is not only not\nforced on us by logic, but that it is an improbable hypothesis.\nThe great claim made for the absolute is that by supposing it we make\nthe world appear more rational. Any hypothesis that does that will\nalways be accepted as more probably true than an hypothesis that makes\nthe world appear irrational. Men are once for all so made that they\nprefer a rational world to believe in and to live in. But rationality\nhas at least four dimensions, intellectual, aesthetical, moral, and\npractical; and to find a world rational to the maximal degree _in all\nthese respects simultaneously_ is no easy matter. Intellectually, the\nworld of mechanical materialism is the most rational, for we subject\nits events to mathematical calculation. But the mechanical world\nis ugly, as arithmetic is ugly, and it is non-moral. Morally,\nthe theistic world is rational enough, but full of intellectual\nfrustrations. The practical world of affairs, in its turn, so\nsupremely rational to the politician, the military man, or the man of\nconquering business-faculty that he never would vote to change the\ntype of it, is irrational to moral and artistic temperaments; so that\nwhatever demand for rationality we find satisfied by a philosophic\nhypothesis, we are liable to find some other demand for rationality\nunsatisfied by the same hypothesis. The rationality we gain in one\ncoin we thus pay for in another; and the problem accordingly seems at\nfirst sight to resolve itself into that of getting a conception which\nwill yield the largest _balance_ of rationality rather than one which\nwill yield perfect rationality of every description. In general, it\nmay be said that if a man's conception of the world lets loose any\naction in him that is easy, or any faculty which he is fond of\nexercising, he will deem it rational in so far forth, be the faculty\nthat of computing, fighting, lecturing, classifying, framing schematic\ntabulations, getting the better end of a bargain, patiently waiting\nand enduring, preaching, joke-making, or what you like. Albeit the\nabsolute is defined as being necessarily an embodiment of objectively\nperfect rationality, it is fair to its english advocates to say that\nthose who have espoused the hypothesis most concretely and seriously\nhave usually avowed the irrationality to their own minds of certain\nelements in it.\nProbably the weightiest contribution to our feeling of the rationality\nof the universe which the notion of the absolute brings is the\nassurance that however disturbed the surface may be, at bottom all is\nwell with the cosmos--central peace abiding at the heart of endless\nagitation. This conception is rational in many ways, beautiful\naesthetically, beautiful intellectually (could we only follow it into\ndetail), and beautiful morally, if the enjoyment of security can be\naccounted moral. Practically it is less beautiful; for, as we saw in\nour last lecture, in representing the deepest reality of the world as\nstatic and without a history, it loosens the world's hold upon our\nsympathies and leaves the soul of it foreign. Nevertheless it does\ngive _peace_, and that kind of rationality is so paramountly demanded\nby men that to the end of time there will be absolutists, men who\nchoose belief in a static eternal, rather than admit that the finite\nworld of change and striving, even with a God as one of the strivers,\nis itself eternal. For such minds Professor Royce's words will always\nbe the truest: 'The very presence of ill in the temporal order is the\ncondition of the perfection of the eternal order.... We long for the\nabsolute only in so far as in us the absolute also longs, and seeks\nthrough our very temporal striving, the peace that is nowhere in time,\nbut only, and yet absolutely, in eternity. Were there no longing in\ntime there would be no peace in eternity.... God [_i.e._ the absolute]\nwho here in me aims at what I now temporally miss, not only possesses\nin the eternal world the goal after which I strive, but comes to\npossess it even through and because of my sorrow. Through this my\ntribulation the absolute triumph then is won.... In the absolute I am\nfulfilled. Yet my very fulfilment demands and therefore can transcend\nthis sorrow.'[7] Royce is particularly felicitous in his ability to\ncite parts of finite experience to which he finds his picture of this\nabsolute experience analogous. But it is hard to portray the absolute\nat all without rising into what might be called the 'inspired' style\nof language--I use the word not ironically, but prosaically and\ndescriptively, to designate the only literary form that goes with the\nkind of emotion that the absolute arouses. One can follow the pathway\nof reasoning soberly enough,[8] but the picture itself has to be\neffulgent. This admirable faculty of transcending, whilst inwardly\npreserving, every contrariety, is the absolute's characteristic form\nof rationality. We are but syllables in the mouth of the Lord; if the\nwhole sentence is divine, each syllable is absolutely what it should\nbe, in spite of all appearances. In making up the balance for or\nagainst absolutism, this emotional value weights heavily the credit\nside of the account.\nThe trouble is that we are able to see so little into the positive\ndetail of it, and that if once admitted not to be coercively proven\nby the intellectualist arguments, it remains only a hypothetic\npossibility.\nOn the debit side of the account the absolute, taken seriously, and\nnot as a mere name for our right occasionally to drop the strenuous\nmood and take a moral holiday, introduces all those tremendous\nirrationalities into the universe which a frankly pluralistic theism\nescapes, but which have been flung as a reproach at every form of\nmonistic theism or pantheism. It introduces a speculative 'problem\nof evil' namely, and leaves us wondering why the perfection of the\nabsolute should require just such particular hideous forms of life as\ndarken the day for our human imaginations. If they were forced on it\nby something alien, and to 'overcome' them the absolute had still to\nkeep hold of them, we could understand its feeling of triumph, though\nwe, so far as we were ourselves among the elements overcome, could\nacquiesce but sullenly in the resultant situation, and would never\njust have chosen it as the most rational one conceivable. But the\nabsolute is represented as a being without environment, upon which\nnothing alien can be forced, and which has spontaneously chosen from\nwithin to give itself the spectacle of all that evil rather than a\nspectacle with less evil in it.[9] Its perfection is represented as\nthe source of things, and yet the first effect of that perfection is\nthe tremendous imperfection of all finite experience. In whatever\nsense the word 'rationality' may be taken, it is vain to contend that\nthe impression made on our finite minds by such a way of representing\nthings is altogether rational. Theologians have felt its irrationality\nacutely, and the 'fall,' the predestination, and the election which\nthe situation involves have given them more trouble than anything else\nin their attempt to pantheize Christianity. The whole business remains\na puzzle, both intellectually and morally.\nGrant that the spectacle or world-romance offered to itself by the\nabsolute is in the absolute's eyes perfect. Why would not the world be\nmore perfect by having the affair remain in just those terms, and\nby not having any finite spectators to come in and add to what was\nperfect already their innumerable imperfect manners of seeing the same\nspectacle? Suppose the entire universe to consist of one superb copy\nof a book, fit for the ideal reader. Is that universe improved or\ndeteriorated by having myriads of garbled and misprinted separate\nleaves and chapters also created, giving false impressions of the book\nto whoever looks at them? To say the least, the balance of rationality\nis not obviously in favor of such added mutilations. So this question\nbecomes urgent: Why, the absolute's own total vision of things\nbeing so rational, was it necessary to comminute it into all these\ncoexisting inferior fragmentary visions?\nLeibnitz in his theodicy represents God as limited by an antecedent\nreason in things which makes certain combinations logically\nincompatible, certain goods impossible. He surveys in advance all the\nuniverses he might create, and by an act of what Leibnitz calls his\nantecedent will he chooses our actual world as the one in which the\nevil, unhappily necessary anyhow, is at its minimum. It is the best of\nall the worlds that are possible, therefore, but by no means the most\nabstractly desirable world. Having made this mental choice, God next\nproceeds to what Leibnitz calls his act of consequent or decretory\nwill: he says '_Fiat_' and the world selected springs into objective\nbeing, with all the finite creatures in it to suffer from its\nimperfections without sharing in its creator's atoning vision.\nLotze has made some penetrating remarks on this conception of\nLeibnitz's, and they exactly fall in with what I say of the absolutist\nconception. The world projected out of the creative mind by the\n_fiat_, and existing in detachment from its author, is a sphere of\nbeing where the parts realize themselves only singly. If the divine\nvalue of them is evident only when they are collectively looked at,\nthen, Lotze rightly says, the world surely becomes poorer and not\nricher for God's utterance of the _fiat_. He might much better have\nremained contented with his merely antecedent choice of the scheme,\nwithout following it up by a creative decree. The scheme _as such_ was\nadmirable; it could only lose by being translated into reality.[10]\nWhy, I similarly ask, should the absolute ever have lapsed from the\nperfection of its own integral experience of things, and refracted\nitself into all our finite experiences?\nIt is but fair to recent english absolutists to say that many of them\nhave confessed the imperfect rationality of the absolute from this\npoint of view. Mr. McTaggart, for example, writes: 'Does not our very\nfailure to perceive the perfection of the universe destroy it? ... In\nso far as we do not see the perfection of the universe, we are not\nperfect ourselves. And as we are parts of the universe, that cannot be\nperfect.'[11]\nAnd Mr. Joachim finds just the same difficulty. Calling the hypothesis\nof the absolute by the name of the 'coherence theory of truth,' he\ncalls the problem of understanding how the complete coherence of all\nthings in the absolute should involve as a necessary moment in\nits self-maintenance the self-assertion of the finite minds, a\nself-assertion which in its extreme form is error,--he calls this\nproblem, I say, an insoluble puzzle. If truth be the universal _fons\net origo_, how does error slip in? 'The coherence theory of truth,' he\nconcludes, 'may thus be said to suffer shipwreck at the very\nentrance of the harbor.'[12] Yet in spite of this rather bad form\nof irrationality, Mr. Joachim stoutly asserts his 'immediate\ncertainty'[13] of the theory shipwrecked, the correctness of which\nhe says he has 'never doubted.' This candid confession of a fixed\nattitude of faith in the absolute, which even one's own criticisms and\nperplexities fail to disturb, seems to me very significant. Not only\nempiricists, but absolutists also, would all, if they were as candid\nas this author, confess that the prime thing in their philosophy\nis their vision of a truth possible, which they then employ their\nreasoning to convert, as best it can, into a certainty or probability.\nI can imagine a believer in the absolute retorting at this point that\n_he_ at any rate is not dealing with mere probabilities, but that\nthe nature of things logically requires the multitudinous erroneous\ncopies, and that therefore the universe cannot be the absolute's book\nalone. For, he will ask, is not the absolute defined as the total\nconsciousness of everything that is? Must not its field of view\nconsist of parts? And what can the parts of a total consciousness be\nunless they be fractional consciousnesses? Our finite minds _must_\ntherefore coexist with the absolute mind. We are its constituents, and\nit cannot live without us.--But if any one of you feels tempted to\nretort in this wise, let me remind you that you are frankly employing\npluralistic weapons, and thereby giving up the absolutist cause. The\nnotion that the absolute is made of constituents on which its being\ndepends is the rankest empiricism. The absolute as such has _objects_,\nnot constituents, and if the objects develop selfhoods upon their own\nseveral accounts, those selfhoods must be set down as facts additional\nto the absolute consciousness, and not as elements implicated in its\ndefinition. The absolute is a rationalist conception. Rationalism\ngoes from wholes to parts, and always assumes wholes to be\nself-sufficing.[14]\nMy conclusion, so far, then, is this, that altho the hypothesis of the\nabsolute, in yielding a certain kind of religious peace, performs\na most important rationalizing function, it nevertheless, from\nthe intellectual point of view, remains decidedly irrational. The\n_ideally_ perfect whole is certainly that whole of which the _parts\nalso are perfect_--if we can depend on logic for anything, we can\ndepend on it for that definition. The absolute is defined as the\nideally perfect whole, yet most of its parts, if not all, are\nadmittedly imperfect. Evidently the conception lacks internal\nconsistency, and yields us a problem rather than a solution. It\ncreates a speculative puzzle, the so-called mystery of evil and of\nerror, from which a pluralistic metaphysic is entirely free.\nIn any pluralistic metaphysic, the problems that evil presents are\npractical, not speculative. Not why evil should exist at all, but how\nwe can lessen the actual amount of it, is the sole question we need\nthere consider. 'God,' in the religious life of ordinary men, is the\nname not of the whole of things, heaven forbid, but only of the ideal\ntendency in things, believed in as a superhuman person who calls us to\nco-operate in his purposes, and who furthers ours if they are worthy.\nHe works in an external environment, has limits, and has enemies. When\nJohn Mill said that the notion of God's omnipotence must be given up,\nif God is to be kept as a religious object, he was surely accurately\nright; yet so prevalent is the lazy monism that idly haunts the region\nof God's name, that so simple and truthful a saying was generally\ntreated as a paradox: God, it was said, _could_ not be finite. I\nbelieve that the only God worthy of the name _must_ be finite, and I\nshall return to this point in a later lecture. If the absolute exist\nin addition--and the hypothesis must, in spite of its irrational\nfeatures, still be left open--then the absolute is only the wider\ncosmic whole of which our God is but the most ideal portion, and which\nin the more usual human sense is hardly to be termed a religious\nhypothesis at all. 'Cosmic emotion' is the better name for the\nreaction it may awaken.\nObserve that all the irrationalities and puzzles which the absolute\ngives rise to, and from which the finite God remains free, are due to\nthe fact that the absolute has nothing, absolutely nothing, outside of\nitself. The finite God whom I contrast with it may conceivably have\n_almost_ nothing outside of himself; he may already have triumphed\nover and absorbed all but the minutest fraction of the universe; but\nthat fraction, however small, reduces him to the status of a\nrelative being, and in principle the universe is saved from all the\nirrationalities incidental to absolutism. The only irrationality left\nwould be the irrationality of which pluralism as such is accused, and\nof this I hope to say a word more later.\nI have tired you with so many subtleties in this lecture that I will\nadd only two other counts to my indictment.\nFirst, then, let me remind you that _the absolute is useless for\ndeductive purposes_. It gives us absolute safety if you will, but\nit is compatible with every relative danger. You cannot enter the\nphenomenal world with the notion of it in your grasp, and name\nbeforehand any detail which you are likely to meet there. Whatever the\ndetails of experience may prove to be, _after the fact of them_\nthe absolute will adopt them. It is an hypothesis that functions\nretrospectively only, not prospectively. _That_, whatever it may be,\nwill have been in point of fact the sort of world which the absolute\nwas pleased to offer to itself as a spectacle.\nAgain, the absolute is always represented idealistically, as the\nall-knower. Thinking this view consistently out leads one to frame\nan almost ridiculous conception of the absolute mind, owing to the\nenormous mass of unprofitable information which it would then seem\nobliged to carry. One of the many _reductiones ad absurdum_ of\npluralism by which idealism thinks it proves the absolute One is as\nfollows: Let there be many facts; but since on idealist principles\nfacts exist only by being known, the many facts will therefore mean\nmany knowers. But that there are so many knowers is itself a fact,\nwhich in turn requires _its_ knower, so the one absolute knower has\neventually to be brought in. _All_ facts lead to him. If it be a fact\nthat this table is not a chair, not a rhinoceros, not a logarithm, not\na mile away from the door, not worth five hundred pounds sterling, not\na thousand centuries old, the absolute must even now be articulately\naware of all these negations. Along with what everything is it must\nalso be conscious of everything which it is not. This infinite\natmosphere of explicit negativity--observe that it has to be\nexplicit--around everything seems to us so useless an encumbrance as\nto make the absolute still more foreign to our sympathy. Furthermore,\nif it be a fact that certain ideas are silly, the absolute has to have\nalready thought the silly ideas to establish them in silliness. The\nrubbish in its mind would thus appear easily to outweigh in amount the\nmore desirable material. One would expect it fairly to burst with such\nan obesity, plethora, and superfoetation of useless information.[15]\nI will spare you further objections. The sum of it all is that the\nabsolute is not forced on our belief by logic, that it involves\nfeatures of irrationality peculiar to itself, and that a thinker\nto whom it does not come as an 'immediate certainty' (to use Mr.\nJoachim's words), is in no way bound to treat it as anything but an\nemotionally rather sublime hypothesis. As such, it might, with all its\ndefects, be, on account of its peace-conferring power and its formal\ngrandeur, more rational than anything else in the field. But meanwhile\nthe strung-along unfinished world in time is its rival: _reality MAY\nexist in distributive form, in the shape not of an all but of a set of\neaches, just as it seems to_--this is the anti-absolutist hypothesis.\n_Prima facie_ there is this in favor of the eaches, that they are at\nany rate real enough to have made themselves at least _appear_ to\nevery one, whereas the absolute has as yet appeared immediately to\nonly a few mystics, and indeed to them very ambiguously. The advocates\nof the absolute assure us that any distributive form of being is\ninfected and undermined by self-contradiction. If we are unable to\nassimilate their arguments, and we have been unable, the only course\nwe can take, it seems to me, is to let the absolute bury the absolute,\nand to seek reality in more promising directions, even among the\ndetails of the finite and the immediately given.\nIf these words of mine sound in bad taste to some of you, or even\nsacrilegious, I am sorry. Perhaps the impression may be mitigated by\nwhat I have to say in later lectures.\nLECTURE IV\nCONCERNING FECHNER\nThe prestige of the absolute has rather crumbled in our hands.\nThe logical proofs of it miss fire; the portraits which its best\ncourt-painters show of it are featureless and foggy in the extreme;\nand, apart from the cold comfort of assuring us that with _it_ all is\nwell, and that to see that all is well with us also we need only rise\nto its eternal point of view, it yields us no relief whatever. It\nintroduces, on the contrary, into philosophy and theology certain\npoisonous difficulties of which but for its intrusion we never should\nhave heard.\nBut if we drop the absolute out of the world, must we then conclude\nthat the world contains nothing better in the way of consciousness\nthan our consciousness? Is our whole instinctive belief in higher\npresences, our persistent inner turning towards divine companionship,\nto count for nothing? Is it but the pathetic illusion of beings with\nincorrigibly social and imaginative minds?\nSuch a negative conclusion would, I believe, be desperately hasty,\na sort of pouring out of the child with the bath. Logically it is\npossible to believe in superhuman beings without identifying them with\nthe absolute at all. The treaty of offensive and defensive alliance\nwhich certain groups of the Christian clergy have recently made with\nour transcendentalist philosophers seems to me to be based on a\nwell-meaning but baleful mistake. Neither the Jehovah of the old\ntestament nor the heavenly father of the new has anything in common\nwith the absolute except that they are all three greater than man;\nand if you say that the notion of the absolute is what the gods of\nAbraham, of David, and of Jesus, after first developing into each\nother, were inevitably destined to develop into in more reflective\nand modern minds, I reply that although in certain specifically\nphilosophical minds this may have been the case, in minds more\nproperly to be termed religious the development has followed quite\nanother path. The whole history of evangelical Christianity is there\nto prove it. I propose in these lectures to plead for that other line\nof development. To set the doctrine of the absolute in its proper\nframework, so that it shall not fill the whole welkin and exclude all\nalternative possibilities of higher thought--as it seems to do for\nmany students who approach it with a limited previous acquaintance\nwith philosophy--I will contrast it with a system which, abstractly\nconsidered, seems at first to have much in common with absolutism, but\nwhich, when taken concretely and temperamentally, really stands at the\nopposite pole. I refer to the philosophy of Gustav Theodor Fechner, a\nwriter but little known as yet to English readers, but destined, I am\npersuaded, to wield more and more influence as time goes on.\nIt is the intense concreteness of Fechner, his fertility of detail,\nwhich fills me with an admiration which I should like to make this\naudience share. Among the philosophic cranks of my acquaintance in the\npast was a lady all the tenets of whose system I have forgotten except\none. Had she been born in the Ionian Archipelago some three thousand\nyears ago, that one doctrine would probably have made her name sure\nof a place in every university curriculum and examination paper. The\nworld, she said, is composed of only two elements, the Thick, namely,\nand the Thin. No one can deny the truth of this analysis, as far as it\ngoes (though in the light of our contemporary knowledge of nature it\nhas itself a rather 'thin' sound), and it is nowhere truer than in\nthat part of the world called philosophy. I am sure, for example, that\nmany of you, listening to what poor account I have been able to\ngive of transcendental idealism, have received an impression of its\narguments being strangely thin, and of the terms it leaves us with\nbeing shiveringly thin wrappings for so thick and burly a world as\nthis. Some of you of course will charge the thinness to my exposition;\nbut thin as that has been, I believe the doctrines reported on to have\nbeen thinner. From Green to Haldane the absolute proposed to us to\nstraighten out the confusions of the thicket of experience in which\nour life is passed remains a pure abstraction which hardly any one\ntries to make a whit concreter. If we open Green, we get nothing but\nthe transcendental ego of apperception (Kant's name for the fact that\nto be counted in experience a thing has to be witnessed), blown up\ninto a sort of timeless soap-bubble large enough to mirror the whole\nuniverse. Nature, Green keeps insisting, consists only in\nrelations, and these imply the action of a mind that is eternal;\na self-distinguishing consciousness which itself escapes from the\nrelations by which it determines other things. Present to whatever is\nin succession, it is not in succession itself. If we take the Cairds,\nthey tell us little more of the principle of the universe--it is\nalways a return into the identity of the self from the difference of\nits objects. It separates itself from them and so becomes conscious of\nthem in their separation from one another, while at the same time it\nbinds them together as elements in one higher self-consciousness.\nThis seems the very quintessence of thinness; and the matter hardly\ngrows thicker when we gather, after enormous amounts of reading, that\nthe great enveloping self in question is absolute reason as such, and\nthat as such it is characterized by the habit of using certain jejune\n'categories' with which to perform its eminent relating work. The\nwhole active material of natural fact is tried out, and only the\nbarest intellectualistic formalism remains.\nHegel tried, as we saw, to make the system concreter by making the\nrelations between things 'dialectic,' but if we turn to those who use\nhis name most worshipfully, we find them giving up all the particulars\nof his attempt, and simply praising his intention--much as in our\nmanner we have praised it ourselves. Mr. Haldane, for example, in his\nwonderfully clever Gifford lectures, praises Hegel to the skies, but\nwhat he tells of him amounts to little more than this, that 'the\ncategories in which the mind arranges its experiences, and gives\nmeaning to them, the universals in which the particulars are grasped\nin the individual, are a logical chain, in which the first presupposes\nthe last, and the last is its presupposition and its truth.' He hardly\ntries at all to thicken this thin logical scheme. He says indeed\nthat absolute mind in itself, and absolute mind in its hetereity or\notherness, under the distinction which it sets up of itself from\nitself, have as their real _prius_ absolute mind in synthesis; and,\nthis being absolute mind's true nature, its dialectic character must\nshow itself in such concrete forms as Goethe's and Wordsworth's\npoetry, as well as in religious forms. 'The nature of God, the nature\nof absolute mind, is to exhibit the triple movement of dialectic, and\nso the nature of God as presented in religion must be a triplicity,\na trinity.' But beyond thus naming Goethe and Wordsworth and\nestablishing the trinity, Mr. Haldane's Hegelianism carries us hardly\nan inch into the concrete detail of the world we actually inhabit.\nEqually thin is Mr. Taylor, both in his principles and in their\nresults. Following Mr. Bradley, he starts by assuring us that reality\ncannot be self-contradictory, but to be related to anything really\noutside of one's self is to be self-contradictory, so the ultimate\nreality must be a single all-inclusive systematic whole. Yet all he\ncan say of this whole at the end of his excellently written book is\nthat the notion of it 'can make no addition to our information and can\nof itself supply no motives for practical endeavor.'\nMr. McTaggart treats us to almost as thin a fare. 'The main practical\ninterest of Hegel's philosophy,' he says, 'is to be found in the\nabstract certainty which the logic gives us that all reality is\nrational and righteous, even when we cannot see in the least how it is\nso.... Not that it shows us how the facts around us are good, not that\nit shows us how we can make them better, but that it proves that they,\nlike other reality, are _sub specie eternitatis_, perfectly good, and\n_sub specie temporis_, destined to become perfectly good.'\nHere again, no detail whatever, only the abstract certainty that\nwhatever the detail may prove to be, it will be good. Common\nnon-dialectical men have already this certainty as a result of the\ngenerous vital enthusiasm about the universe with which they are born.\nThe peculiarity of transcendental philosophy is its sovereign contempt\nfor merely vital functions like enthusiasm, and its pretension to turn\nour simple and immediate trusts and faiths into the form of logically\nmediated certainties, to question which would be absurd. But the whole\nbasis on which Mr. McTaggart's own certainty so solidly rests, settles\ndown into the one nutshell of an assertion into which he puts Hegel's\ngospel, namely, that in every bit of experience and thought, however\nfinite, the whole of reality (the absolute idea, as Hegel calls it) is\n'implicitly present.'\nThis indeed is Hegel's _vision_, and Hegel thought that the details of\nhis dialectic proved its truth. But disciples who treat the details of\nthe proof as unsatisfactory and yet cling to the vision, are surely,\nin spite of their pretension to a more rational consciousness, no\nbetter than common men with their enthusiasms or deliberately adopted\nfaiths. We have ourselves seen some of the weakness of the monistic\nproofs. Mr. McTaggart picks plenty of holes of his own in Hegel's\nlogic, and finally concludes that 'all true philosophy must be\nmystical, not indeed in its methods but in its final conclusions,'\nwhich is as much as to say that the rationalistic methods leave us\nin the lurch, in spite of all their superiority, and that in the end\nvision and faith must eke them out. But how abstract and thin is\nhere the vision, to say nothing of the faith! The whole of reality,\nexplicitly absent from our finite experiences, must nevertheless\nbe present in them all implicitly, altho no one of us can ever see\nhow--the bare word 'implicit' here bearing the whole pyramid of the\nmonistic system on its slender point. Mr. Joachim's monistic system of\ntruth rests on an even slenderer point.--_I have never doubted_,'\nhe says, 'that universal and timeless truth is a single content or\nsignificance, one and whole and complete,' and he candidly confesses\nthe failure of rationalistic attempts 'to raise this immediate\ncertainty' to the level of reflective knowledge. There is, in short,\nno mediation for him between the Truth in capital letters and all\nthe little 'lower-case' truths--and errors--which life presents. The\npsychological fact that he never has 'doubted' is enough.\nThe whole monistic pyramid, resting on points as thin as these, seems\nto me to be a _machtspruch_, a product of will far more than one of\nreason. Unity is good, therefore things _shall_ cohere; they _shall_\nbe one; there _shall_ be categories to make them one, no matter what\nempirical disjunctions may appear. In Hegel's own writings, the\n_shall-be_ temper is ubiquitous and towering; it overrides verbal and\nlogical resistances alike. Hegel's error, as Professor Royce so well\nsays, 'lay not in introducing logic into passion,' as some people\ncharge, 'but in conceiving the logic of passion as the only logic....\nHe is [thus] suggestive,' Royce says, 'but never final. His system as\na system has crumbled, but his vital comprehension of our life remains\nforever.'[1]\nThat vital comprehension we have already seen. It is that there is a\nsense in which real things are not merely their own bare selves, but\nmay vaguely be treated as also their own others, and that ordinary\nlogic, since it denies this, must be overcome. Ordinary logic denies\nthis because it substitutes concepts for real things, and concepts\n_are_ their own bare selves and nothing else. What Royce calls Hegel's\n'system' was Hegel's attempt to make us believe that he was working\nby concepts and grinding out a higher style of logic, when in reality\nsensible experiences, hypotheses, and passion furnished him with all\nhis results.\nWhat I myself may mean by things being their own others, we shall see\nin a later lecture. It is now time to take our look at Fechner, whose\nthickness is a refreshing contrast to the thin, abstract, indigent,\nand threadbare appearance, the starving, school-room aspect, which the\nspeculations of most of our absolutist philosophers present.\nThere is something really weird and uncanny in the contrast between\nthe abstract pretensions of rationalism and what rationalistic methods\nconcretely can do. If the 'logical prius' of our mind were really the\n'implicit presence' of the whole 'concrete universal,' the whole of\nreason, or reality, or spirit, or the absolute idea, or whatever it\nmay be called, in all our finite thinking, and if this reason worked\n(for example) by the dialectical method, doesn't it seem odd that\nin the greatest instance of rationalization mankind has known, in\n'science,' namely, the dialectical method should never once have been\ntried? Not a solitary instance of the use of it in science occurs\nto my mind. Hypotheses, and deductions from these, controlled by\nsense-observations and analogies with what we know elsewhere, are to\nbe thanked for all of science's results.\nFechner used no methods but these latter ones in arguing for his\nmetaphysical conclusions about reality--but let me first rehearse a\nfew of the facts about his life.\nBorn in 1801, the son of a poor country pastor in Saxony, he lived\nfrom 1817 to 1887, when he died, seventy years therefore, at Leipzig,\na typical _gelehrter_ of the old-fashioned german stripe. His means\nwere always scanty, so his only extravagances could be in the way\nof thought, but these were gorgeous ones. He passed his medical\nexaminations at Leipzig University at the age of twenty-one, but\ndecided, instead of becoming a doctor, to devote himself to physical\nscience. It was ten years before he was made professor of physics,\nalthough he soon was authorized to lecture. Meanwhile, he had to make\nboth ends meet, and this he did by voluminous literary labors. He\ntranslated, for example, the four volumes of Biot's treatise on\nphysics, and the six of Th\u00e9nard's work on chemistry, and took care of\ntheir enlarged editions later. He edited repertories of chemistry\nand physics, a pharmaceutical journal, and an encyclopaedia in eight\nvolumes, of which he wrote about one third. He published physical\ntreatises and experimental investigations of his own, especially in\nelectricity. Electrical measurements, as you know, are the basis of\nelectrical science, and Fechner's measurements in galvanism, performed\nwith the simplest self-made apparatus, are classic to this day.\nDuring this time he also published a number of half-philosophical,\nhalf-humorous writings, which have gone through several editions,\nunder the name of Dr. Mises, besides poems, literary and artistic\nessays, and other occasional articles.\nBut overwork, poverty, and an eye-trouble produced by his observations\non after-images in the retina (also a classic piece of investigation)\nproduced in Fechner, then about thirty-eight years old, a terrific\nattack of nervous prostration with painful hyperaesthesia of all the\nfunctions, from which he suffered three years, cut off entirely from\nactive life. Present-day medicine would have classed poor Fechner's\nmalady quickly enough, as partly a habit-neurosis, but its\nseverity was such that in his day it was treated as a visitation\nincomprehensible in its malignity; and when he suddenly began to get\nwell, both Fechner and others treated the recovery as a sort of divine\nmiracle. This illness, bringing Fechner face to face with inner\ndesperation, made a great crisis in his life. 'Had I not then clung to\nthe faith,' he writes, 'that clinging to faith would somehow or other\nwork its reward, _so h\u00e4tte ich jene zeit nicht ausgehalten_.' His\nreligious and cosmological faiths saved him--thenceforward one great\naim with him was to work out and communicate these faiths to the\nworld. He did so on the largest scale; but he did many other things\ntoo ere he died.\nA book on the atomic theory, classic also; four elaborate mathematical\nand experimental volumes on what he called psychophysics--many persons\nconsider Fechner to have practically founded scientific psychology in\nthe first of these books; a volume on organic evolution, and two works\non experimental aesthetics, in which again Fechner is considered by\nsome judges to have laid the foundations of a new science, must be\nincluded among these other performances. Of the more religious and\nphilosophical works, I shall immediately give a further account.\nAll Leipzig mourned him when he died, for he was the pattern of the\nideal german scholar, as daringly original in his thought as he was\nhomely in his life, a modest, genial, laborious slave to truth and\nlearning, and withal the owner of an admirable literary style of the\nvernacular sort. The materialistic generation, that in the fifties and\nsixties called his speculations fantastic, had been replaced by one\nwith greater liberty of imagination, and a Preyer, a Wundt, a Paulsen,\nand a Lasswitz could now speak of Fechner as their master.\nHis mind was indeed one of those multitudinously organized cross-roads\nof truth which are occupied only at rare intervals by children of men,\nand from which nothing is either too far or too near to be seen in due\nperspective. Patientest observation, exactest mathematics, shrewdest\ndiscrimination, humanest feeling, flourished in him on the largest\nscale, with no apparent detriment to one another. He was in fact a\nphilosopher in the 'great' sense, altho he cared so much less than\nmost philosophers care for abstractions of the 'thin' order. For him\nthe abstract lived in the concrete, and the hidden motive of all he\ndid was to bring what he called the daylight view of the world into\never greater evidence, that daylight view being this, that the whole\nuniverse in its different spans and wave-lengths, exclusions and\nenvelopments, is everywhere alive and conscious. It has taken fifty\nyears for his chief book, 'Zend-avesta,' to pass into a second edition\n(1901). 'One swallow,' he cheerfully writes, 'does not make a summer.\nBut the first swallow would not come unless the summer were coming;\nand for me that summer means my daylight view some time prevailing.'\nThe original sin, according to Fechner, of both our popular and\nour scientific thinking, is our inveterate habit of regarding the\nspiritual not as the rule but as an exception in the midst of nature.\nInstead of believing our life to be fed at the breasts of the greater\nlife, our individuality to be sustained by the greater individuality,\nwhich must necessarily have more consciousness and more independence\nthan all that it brings forth, we habitually treat whatever lies\noutside of our life as so much slag and ashes of life only; or if we\nbelieve in a Divine Spirit, we fancy him on the one side as bodiless,\nand nature as soulless on the other. What comfort, or peace, Fechner\nasks, can come from such a doctrine? The flowers wither at its breath,\nthe stars turn into stone; our own body grows unworthy of our spirit\nand sinks to a tenement for carnal senses only. The book of nature\nturns into a volume on mechanics, in which whatever has life is\ntreated as a sort of anomaly; a great chasm of separation yawns\nbetween us and all that is higher than ourselves; and God becomes a\nthin nest of abstractions.\nFechner's great instrument for vivifying the daylight view is\nanalogy; not a rationalistic argument is to be found in all his\nmany pages--only reasonings like those which men continually use in\npractical life. For example: My house is built by some one, the world\ntoo is built by some one. The world is greater than my house, it\nmust be a greater some one who built the world. My body moves by the\ninfluence of my feeling and will; the sun, moon, sea, and wind, being\nthemselves more powerful, move by the influence of some more powerful\nfeeling and will. I live now, and change from one day to another; I\nshall live hereafter, and change still more, etc.\nBain defines genius as the power of seeing analogies. The number\nthat Fechner could perceive was prodigious; but he insisted on the\ndifferences as well. Neglect to make allowance for these, he said, is\nthe common fallacy in analogical reasoning. Most of us, for example,\nreasoning justly that, since all the minds we know are connected with\nbodies, therefore God's mind should be connected with a body, proceed\nto suppose that that body must be just an animal body over again, and\npaint an altogether human picture of God. But all that the analogy\ncomports is _a_ body--the particular features of _our_ body are\nadaptations to a habitat so different from God's that if God have\na physical body at all, it must be utterly different from ours in\nstructure. Throughout his writings Fechner makes difference and\nanalogy walk abreast, and by his extraordinary power of noticing\nboth, he converts what would ordinarily pass for objections to his\nconclusions into factors of their support.\nThe vaster orders of mind go with the vaster orders of body. The\nentire earth on which we live must have, according to Fechner, its own\ncollective consciousness. So must each sun, moon, and planet; so must\nthe whole solar system have its own wider consciousness, in which the\nconsciousness of our earth plays one part. So has the entire starry\nsystem as such its consciousness; and if that starry system be not the\nsum of all that _is_, materially considered, then that whole system,\nalong with whatever else may be, is the body of that absolutely\ntotalized consciousness of the universe to which men give the name of\nGod.\nSpeculatively Fechner is thus a monist in his theology; but there is\nroom in his universe for every grade of spiritual being between man\nand the final all-inclusive God; and in suggesting what the positive\ncontent of all this super-humanity may be, he hardly lets his\nimagination fly beyond simple spirits of the planetary order. The\nearth-soul he passionately believes in; he treats the earth as our\nspecial human guardian angel; we can pray to the earth as men pray to\ntheir saints; but I think that in his system, as in so many of the\nactual historic theologies, the supreme God marks only a sort of limit\nof enclosure of the worlds above man. He is left thin and abstract in\nhis majesty, men preferring to carry on their personal transactions\nwith the many less remote and abstract messengers and mediators whom\nthe divine order provides.\nI shall ask later whether the abstractly monistic turn which Fechner's\nspeculations took was necessitated by logic. I believe it not to have\nbeen required. Meanwhile let me lead you a little more into the\ndetail of his thought. Inevitably one does him miserable injustice\nby summarizing and abridging him. For altho the type of reasoning he\nemploys is almost childlike for simplicity, and his bare conclusions\ncan be written on a single page, the _power_ of the man is due\naltogether to the profuseness of his concrete imagination, to the\nmultitude of the points which he considers successively, to the\ncumulative effect of his learning, of his thoroughness, and of the\ningenuity of his detail, to his admirably homely style, to the\nsincerity with which his pages glow, and finally to the impression he\ngives of a man who doesn't live at second-hand, but who _sees_, who in\nfact speaks as one having authority, and not as if he were one of the\ncommon herd of professorial philosophic scribes.\nAbstractly set down, his most important conclusion for my purpose in\nthese lectures is that the constitution of the world is identical\nthroughout. In ourselves, visual consciousness goes with our eyes,\ntactile consciousness with our skin. But altho neither skin nor eye\nknows aught of the sensations of the other, they come together and\nfigure in some sort of relation and combination in the more inclusive\nconsciousness which each of us names his _self_. Quite similarly,\nthen, says Fechner, we must suppose that my consciousness of myself\nand yours of yourself, altho in their immediacy they keep separate\nand know nothing of each other, are yet known and used together in a\nhigher consciousness, that of the human race, say, into which they\nenter as constituent parts. Similarly, the whole human and animal\nkingdoms come together as conditions of a consciousness of still wider\nscope. This combines in the soul of the earth with the consciousness\nof the vegetable kingdom, which in turn contributes its share of\nexperience to that of the whole solar system, and so on from synthesis\nto synthesis and height to height, till an absolutely universal\nconsciousness is reached.\nA vast analogical series, in which the basis of the analogy consists\nof facts directly observable in ourselves.\nThe supposition of an earth-consciousness meets a strong instinctive\nprejudice which Fechner ingeniously tries to overcome. Man's mind is\nthe highest consciousness upon the earth, we think--the earth itself\nbeing in all ways man's inferior. How should its consciousness, if it\nhave one, be superior to his?\nWhat are the marks of superiority which we are tempted to use here? If\nwe look more carefully into them, Fechner points out that the earth\npossesses each and all of them more perfectly than we. He considers in\ndetail the points of difference between us, and shows them all to\nmake for the earth's higher rank. I will touch on only a few of these\npoints.\nOne of them of course is independence of other external beings.\nExternal to the earth are only the other heavenly bodies. All the\nthings on which we externally depend for life--air, water, plant and\nanimal food, fellow men, etc.--are included in her as her constituent\nparts. She is self-sufficing in a million respects in which we are not\nso. We depend on her for almost everything, she on us for but a small\nportion of her history. She swings us in her orbit from winter to\nsummer and revolves us from day into night and from night into day.\nComplexity in unity is another sign of superiority. The total earth's\ncomplexity far exceeds that of any organism, for she includes all our\norganisms in herself, along with an infinite number of things that our\norganisms fail to include. Yet how simple and massive are the phases\nof her own proper life! As the total bearing of any animal is sedate\nand tranquil compared with the agitation of its blood corpuscles, so\nis the earth a sedate and tranquil being compared with the animals\nwhom she supports.\nTo develop from within, instead of being fashioned from without, is\nalso counted as something superior in men's eyes. An egg is a higher\nstyle of being than a piece of clay which an external modeler makes\ninto the image of a bird. Well, the earth's history develops from\nwithin. It is like that of a wonderful egg which the sun's heat, like\nthat of a mother-hen, has stimulated to its cycles of evolutionary\nchange.\nIndividuality of type, and difference from other beings of its type,\nis another mark of rank. The earth differs from every other planet,\nand as a class planetary beings are extraordinarily distinct from\nother beings.\nLong ago the earth was called an animal; but a planet is a higher\nclass of being than either man or animal; not only quantitatively\ngreater, like a vaster and more awkward whale or elephant, but a being\nwhose enormous size requires an altogether different plan of life. Our\nanimal organization comes from our inferiority. Our need of moving to\nand fro, of stretching our limbs and bending our bodies, shows only\nour defect. What are our legs but crutches, by means of which, with\nrestless efforts, we go hunting after the things we have not inside\nof ourselves. But the earth is no such cripple; why should she who\nalready possesses within herself the things we so painfully pursue,\nhave limbs analogous to ours? Shall she mimic a small part of herself?\nWhat need has she of arms, with nothing to reach for? of a neck, with\nno head to carry? of eyes or nose when she finds her way through space\nwithout either, and has the millions of eyes of all her animals to\nguide their movements on her surface, and all their noses to smell the\nflowers that grow? For, as we are ourselves a part of the earth, so\nour organs are her organs. She is, as it were, eye and ear over her\nwhole extent--all that we see and hear in separation she sees and\nhears at once. She brings forth living beings of countless kinds upon\nher surface, and their multitudinous conscious relations with each\nother she takes up into her higher and more general conscious life.\nMost of us, considering the theory that the whole terrestrial mass is\nanimated as our bodies are, make the mistake of working the analogy\ntoo literally, and allowing for no differences. If the earth be a\nsentient organism, we say, where are her brain and nerves? What\ncorresponds to her heart and lungs? In other words, we expect\nfunctions which she already performs through us, to be performed\noutside of us again, and in just the same way. But we see perfectly\nwell how the earth performs some of these functions in a way unlike\nour way. If you speak of circulation, what need has she of a heart\nwhen the sun keeps all the showers of rain that fall upon her and all\nthe springs and brooks and rivers that irrigate her, going? What need\nhas she of internal lungs, when her whole sensitive surface is in\nliving commerce with the atmosphere that clings to it?\nThe organ that gives us most trouble is the brain. All the\nconsciousness we directly know seems tied to brains.--Can there be\nconsciousness, we ask, where there is no brain? But our brain, which\nprimarily serves to correlate our muscular reactions with the external\nobjects on which we depend, performs a function which the earth\nperforms in an entirely different way. She has no proper muscles or\nlimbs of her own, and the only objects external to her are the other\nstars. To these her whole mass reacts by most exquisite alterations in\nits total gait, and by still more exquisite vibratory responses in\nits substance. Her ocean reflects the lights of heaven as in a mighty\nmirror, her atmosphere refracts them like a monstrous lens, the\nclouds and snow-fields combine them into white, the woods and flowers\ndisperse them into colors. Polarization, interference, absorption,\nawaken sensibilities in matter of which our senses are too coarse to\ntake any note.\nFor these cosmic relations of hers, then, she no more needs a special\nbrain than she needs eyes or ears. _Our_ brains do indeed unify and\ncorrelate innumerable functions. Our eyes know nothing of sound, our\nears nothing of light, but, having brains, we can feel sound and light\ntogether, and compare them. We account for this by the fibres which in\nthe brain connect the optical with the acoustic centre, but just how\nthese fibres bring together not only the sensations, but the centres,\nwe fail to see. But if fibres are indeed all that is needed to do that\ntrick, has not the earth pathways, by which you and I are physically\ncontinuous, more than enough to do for our two minds what the\nbrain-fibres do for the sounds and sights in a single mind? Must every\nhigher means of unification between things be a literal _brain_-fibre,\nand go by that name? Cannot the earth-mind know otherwise the contents\nof our minds together?\nFechner's imagination, insisting on the differences as well as on the\nresemblances, thus tries to make our picture of the whole earth's life\nmore concrete. He revels in the thought of its perfections. To carry\nher precious freight through the hours and seasons what form could be\nmore excellent than hers--being as it is horse, wheels, and wagon all\nin one. Think of her beauty--a shining ball, sky-blue and sun-lit over\none half, the other bathed in starry night, reflecting the heavens\nfrom all her waters, myriads of lights and shadows in the folds of her\nmountains and windings of her valleys, she would be a spectacle of\nrainbow glory, could one only see her from afar as we see parts of her\nfrom her own mountain-tops. Every quality of landscape that has a\nname would then be visible in her at once--all that is delicate or\ngraceful, all that is quiet, or wild, or romantic, or desolate, or\ncheerful, or luxuriant, or fresh. That landscape is her face--a\npeopled landscape, too, for men's eyes would appear in it like\ndiamonds among the dew-drops. Green would be the dominant color, but\nthe blue atmosphere and the clouds would enfold her as a bride is\nshrouded in her veil--a veil the vapory transparent folds of which\nthe earth, through her ministers the winds, never tires of laying and\nfolding about herself anew.\nEvery element has its own living denizens. Can the celestial ocean of\nether, whose waves are light, in which the earth herself floats, not\nhave hers, higher by as much as their element is higher, swimming\nwithout fins, flying without wings, moving, immense and tranquil, as\nby a half-spiritual force through the half-spiritual sea which they\ninhabit, rejoicing in the exchange of luminous influence with one\nanother, following the slightest pull of one another's attraction, and\nharboring, each of them, an inexhaustible inward wealth?\nMen have always made fables about angels, dwelling in the light,\nneeding no earthly food or drink, messengers between ourselves and\nGod. Here are actually existent beings, dwelling in the light and\nmoving through the sky, needing neither food nor drink, intermediaries\nbetween God and us, obeying his commands. So, if the heavens really\nare the home of angels, the heavenly bodies must be those very angels,\nfor other creatures _there_ are none. Yes! the earth is our great\ncommon guardian angel, who watches over all our interests combined.\nIn a striking page Fechner relates one of his moments of direct vision\nof this truth.\n'On a certain spring morning I went out to walk. The fields were\ngreen, the birds sang, the dew glistened, the smoke was rising, here\nand there a man appeared; a light as of transfiguration lay on all\nthings. It was only a little bit of the earth; it was only one moment\nof her existence; and yet as my look embraced her more and more it\nseemed to me not only so beautiful an idea, but so true and clear\na fact, that she is an angel, an angel so rich and fresh and\nflower-like, and yet going her round in the skies so firmly and so\nat one with herself, turning her whole living face to Heaven, and\ncarrying me along with her into that Heaven, that I asked myself how\nthe opinions of men could ever have so spun themselves away from life\nso far as to deem the earth only a dry clod, and to seek for angels\nabove it or about it in the emptiness of the sky,--only to find them\nnowhere.... But such an experience as this passes for fantastic. The\nearth is a globular body, and what more she may be, one can find in\nmineralogical cabinets.'[2]\nWhere there is no vision the people perish. Few professorial\nphilosophers have any vision. Fechner had vision, and that is why one\ncan read him over and over again, and each time bring away a fresh\nsense of reality.\nHis earliest book was a vision of what the inner life of plants may be\nlike. He called it 'Nanna.' In the development of animals the nervous\nsystem is the central fact. Plants develop centrifugally, spread their\norgans abroad. For that reason people suppose that they can have no\nconsciousness, for they lack the unity which the central nervous\nsystem provides. But the plant's consciousness may be of another type,\nbeing connected with other structures. Violins and pianos give out\nsounds because they have strings. Does it follow that nothing but\nstrings can give out sound? How then about flutes and organ-pipes?\nOf course their sounds are of a different quality, and so may the\nconsciousness of plants be of a quality correlated exclusively with\nthe kind of organization that | they possess. Nutrition, respiration,\npropagation take place in them without nerves. In us these functions\nare conscious only in unusual states, normally their consciousness is\neclipsed by that which goes with the brain. No such eclipse occurs in\nplants, and their lower consciousness may therefore be all the more\nlively. With nothing to do but to drink the light and air with their\nleaves, to let their cells proliferate, to feel their rootlets draw\nthe sap, is it conceivable that they should not consciously suffer\nif water, light, and air are suddenly withdrawn? or that when the\nflowering and fertilization which are the culmination of their life\ntake place, they should not feel their own existence more intensely\nand enjoy something like what we call pleasure in ourselves? Does\nthe water-lily, rocking in her triple bath of water, air, and light,\nrelish in no wise her own beauty? When the plant in our room turns to\nthe light, closes her blossoms in the dark, responds to our watering\nor pruning by increase of size or change of shape and bloom, who has\nthe right to say she does not feel, or that she plays a purely passive\npart? Truly plants can foresee nothing, neither the scythe of the\nmower, nor the hand extended to pluck their flowers. They can neither\nrun away nor cry out. But this only proves how different their modes\nof feeling life must be from those of animals that live by eyes and\nears and locomotive organs, it does not prove that they have no mode\nof feeling life at all.\nHow scanty and scattered would sensation be on our globe, if the\nfeeling-life of plants were blotted from existence. Solitary would\nconsciousness move through the woods in the shape of some deer or\nother quadruped, or fly about the flowers in that of some insect, but\ncan we really suppose that the Nature through which God's breath blows\nis such a barren wilderness as this?\nI have probably by this time said enough to acquaint those of you who\nhave never seen these metaphysical writings of Fechner with their more\ngeneral characteristics, and I hope that some of you may now feel like\nreading them yourselves.[3] The special thought of Fechner's with\nwhich in these lectures I have most practical concern, is his\nbelief that the more inclusive forms of consciousness are in part\n_constituted_ by the more limited forms. Not that they are the mere\nsum of the more limited forms. As our mind is not the bare sum of\nour sights plus our sounds plus our pains, but in adding these terms\ntogether also finds relations among them and weaves them into schemes\nand forms and objects of which no one sense in its separate estate\nknows anything, so the earth-soul traces relations between the\ncontents of my mind and the contents of yours of which neither of\nour separate minds is conscious. It has schemes, forms, and objects\nproportionate to its wider field, which our mental fields are far too\nnarrow to cognize. By ourselves we are simply out of relation with\neach other, for it we are both of us there, and _different_ from each\nother, which is a positive relation. What we are without knowing, it\nknows that we are. We are closed against its world, but that world is\nnot closed against us. It is as if the total universe of inner life\nhad a sort of grain or direction, a sort of valvular structure,\npermitting knowledge to flow in one way only, so that the wider might\nalways have the narrower under observation, but never the narrower the\nwider.\nFechner's great analogy here is the relation of the senses to our\nindividual minds. When our eyes are open their sensations enter into\nour general mental life, which grows incessantly by the addition of\nwhat they see. Close the eyes, however, and the visual additions stop,\nnothing but thoughts and memories of the past visual experiences\nremain--in combination of course with the enormous stock of other\nthoughts and memories, and with the data coming in from the senses\nnot yet closed. Our eye-sensations of themselves know nothing of this\nenormous life into which they fall. Fechner thinks, as any common man\nwould think, that they are taken into it directly when they occur,\nand form part of it just as they are. They don't stay outside and\nget represented inside by their copies. It is only the memories and\nconcepts of them that are copies; the sensible perceptions themselves\nare taken in or walled out in their own proper persons according as\nthe eyes are open or shut.\nFechner likens our individual persons on the earth unto so many\nsense-organs of the earth's soul. We add to its perceptive life so\nlong as our own life lasts. It absorbs our perceptions, just as they\noccur, into its larger sphere of knowledge, and combines them with the\nother data there. When one of us dies, it is as if an eye of the world\nwere closed, for all _perceptive_ contributions from that particular\nquarter cease. But the memories and conceptual relations that have\nspun themselves round the perceptions of that person remain in the\nlarger earth-life as distinct as ever, and form new relations and grow\nand develop throughout all the future, in the same way in which our\nown distinct objects of thought, once stored in memory, form new\nrelations and develop throughout our whole finite life. This is\nFechner's theory of immortality, first published in the little\n'B\u00fcchlein des lebens nach dem tode,' in 1836, and re-edited in greatly\nimproved shape in the last volume of his 'Zend-avesta.'\nWe rise upon the earth as wavelets rise upon the ocean. We grow out of\nher soil as leaves grow from a tree. The wavelets catch the sunbeams\nseparately, the leaves stir when the branches do not move. They\nrealize their own events apart, just as in our own consciousness, when\nanything becomes emphatic, the background fades from observation. Yet\nthe event works back upon the background, as the wavelet works upon\nthe waves, or as the leaf's movements work upon the sap inside the\nbranch. The whole sea and the whole tree are registers of what has\nhappened, and are different for the wave's and the leaf's action\nhaving occurred. A grafted twig may modify its stock to the roots:--so\nour outlived private experiences, impressed on the whole earth-mind as\nmemories, lead the immortal life of ideas there, and become parts of\nthe great system, fully distinguished from one another, just as we\nourselves when alive were distinct, realizing themselves no longer\nisolatedly, but along with one another as so many partial systems,\nentering thus into new combinations, being affected by the perceptive\nexperiences of those living then, and affecting the living in their\nturn--altho they are so seldom recognized by living men to do so.\nIf you imagine that this entrance after the death of the body into a\ncommon life of higher type means a merging and loss of our distinct\npersonality, Fechner asks you whether a visual sensation of our own\nexists in any sense _less for itself_ or _less distinctly_, when\nit enters into our higher relational consciousness and is there\ndistinguished and defined.\n--But here I must stop my reporting and send you to his volumes. Thus\nis the universe alive, according to this philosopher! I think you\nwill admit that he makes it more _thickly_ alive than do the other\nphilosophers who, following rationalistic methods solely, gain the\nsame results, but only in the thinnest outlines. Both Fechner and\nProfessor Royce, for example, believe ultimately in one all-inclusive\nmind. Both believe that we, just as we stand here, are constituent\nparts of that mind. No other _content_ has it than us, with all the\nother creatures like or unlike us, and the relations which it finds\nbetween us. Our eaches, collected into one, are substantively\nidentical with its all, tho the all is perfect while no each is\nperfect, so that we have to admit that new qualities as well as\nunperceived relations accrue from the collective form. It is thus\nsuperior to the distributive form. But having reached this result,\nRoyce (tho his treatment of the subject on its moral side seems to\nme infinitely richer and thicker than that of any other contemporary\nidealistic philosopher) leaves us very much to our own devices.\nFechner, on the contrary, tries to trace the superiorities due to the\nmore collective form in as much detail as he can. He marks the various\nintermediary stages and halting places of collectivity,--as we are to\nour separate senses, so is the earth to us, so is the solar system\nto the earth, etc.,--and if, in order to escape an infinitely long\nsummation, he posits a complete God as the all-container and leaves\nhim about as indefinite in feature as the idealists leave their\nabsolute, he yet provides us with a very definite gate of approach to\nhim in the shape of the earth-soul, through which in the nature of\nthings we must first make connexion with all the more enveloping\nsuperhuman realms, and with which our more immediate religious\ncommerce at any rate has to be carried on.\nOrdinary monistic idealism leaves everything intermediary out. It\nrecognizes only the extremes, as if, after the first rude face of the\nphenomenal world in all its particularity, nothing but the supreme in\nall its perfection could be found. First, you and I, just as we are in\nthis room; and the moment we get below that surface, the unutterable\nabsolute itself! Doesn't this show a singularly indigent imagination?\nIsn't this brave universe made on a richer pattern, with room in\nit for a long hierarchy of beings? Materialistic science makes it\ninfinitely richer in terms, with its molecules, and ether, and\nelectrons, and what not. Absolute idealism, thinking of reality only\nunder intellectual forms, knows not what to do with _bodies_ of\nany grade, and can make no use of any psychophysical analogy or\ncorrespondence. The resultant thinness is startling when compared with\nthe thickness and articulation of such a universe as Fechner paints.\nMay not satisfaction with the rationalistic absolute as the alpha\nand omega, and treatment of it in all its abstraction as an adequate\nreligious object, argue a certain native poverty of mental demand?\nThings reveal themselves soonest to those who most passionately want\nthem, for our need sharpens our wit. To a mind content with little,\nthe much in the universe may always remain hid.\nTo be candid, one of my reasons for saying so much about Fechner has\nbeen to make the thinness of our current transcendentalism appear\nmore evident by an effect of contrast. Scholasticism ran thick; Hegel\nhimself ran thick; but english and american transcendentalisms run\nthin. If philosophy is more a matter of passionate vision than of\nlogic,--and I believe it is, logic only finding reasons for the vision\nafterwards,--must not such thinness come either from the vision being\ndefective in the disciples, or from their passion, matched with\nFechner's or with Hegel's own passion, being as moonlight unto\nsunlight or as water unto wine?[4]\nBut I have also a much deeper reason for making Fechner a part of my\ntext. His _assumption that conscious experiences freely compound and\nseparate themselves_, the same assumption by which absolutism explains\nthe relation of our minds to the eternal mind, and the same by\nwhich empiricism explains the composition of the human mind out of\nsubordinate mental elements, is not one which we ought to let pass\nwithout scrutiny. I shall scrutinize it in the next lecture.\nLECTURE V\nTHE COMPOUNDING OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nIn my last lecture I gave a miserably scanty outline of the way\nof thinking of a philosopher remarkable for the almost unexampled\nrichness of his imagination of details. I owe to Fechner's shade an\napology for presenting him in a manner so unfair to the most essential\nquality of his genius; but the time allotted is too short to say more\nabout the particulars of his work, so I proceed to the programme\nI suggested at the end of our last hour. I wish to discuss the\nassumption that states of consciousness, so-called, can separate and\ncombine themselves freely, and keep their own identity unchanged while\nforming parts of simultaneous fields of experience of wider scope.\nLet me first explain just what I mean by this. While you listen to\nmy voice, for example, you are perhaps inattentive to some bodily\nsensation due to your clothing or your posture. Yet that sensation\nwould seem probably to be there, for in an instant, by a change of\nattention, you can have it in one field of consciousness with the\nvoice. It seems as if it existed first in a separate form, and then as\nif, without itself changing, it combined with your other co-existent\nsensations. It is after this analogy that pantheistic idealism thinks\nthat we exist in the absolute. The absolute, it thinks, makes the\nworld by knowing the whole of it at once in one undivided eternal\nact.[1] To 'be,' _really_ to be, is to be as it knows us to be, along\nwith everything else, namely, and clothed with the fulness of our\nmeaning. Meanwhile we _are_ at the same time not only really and as it\nknows us, but also apparently, for to our separate single selves we\nappear _without_ most other things and unable to declare with\nany fulness what our own meaning is. Now the classic doctrine of\npantheistic idealism, from the Upanishads down to Josiah Royce, is\nthat the finite knowers, in spite of their apparent ignorance, are one\nwith the knower of the all. In the most limited moments of our private\nexperience, the absolute idea, as Dr. McTaggart told us, is implicitly\ncontained. The moments, as Royce says, exist only in relation to it.\nThey are true or erroneous only through its overshadowing presence. Of\nthe larger self that alone eternally is, they are the organic parts.\nThey _are_, only inasmuch as they are implicated in its being.\nThere is thus in reality but this one self, consciously inclusive of\nall the lesser selves, _logos_, problem-solver, and all-knower; and\nRoyce ingeniously compares the ignorance that in our persons breaks\nout in the midst of its complete knowledge and isolates me from you\nand both of us from it, to the inattention into which our finite minds\nare liable to fall with respect to such implicitly present details as\nthose corporeal sensations to which I made allusion just now. Those\nsensations stand to our total private minds in the same relation in\nwhich our private minds stand to the absolute mind. Privacy means\nignorance--I still quote Royce--and ignorance means inattention. We\nare finite because our wills, as such, are only fragments of the\nabsolute will; because will means interest, and an incomplete will\nmeans an incomplete interest; and because incompleteness of interest\nmeans inattention to much that a fuller interest would bring us to\nperceive.[2]\nIn this account Royce makes by far the manliest of the post-hegelian\nattempts to read some empirically apprehensible content into the\nnotion of our relation to the absolute mind.\nI have to admit, now that I propose to you to scrutinize this\nassumption rather closely, that trepidation seizes me. The subject is\na subtle and abstruse one. It is one thing to delve into subtleties by\none's self with pen in hand, or to study out abstruse points in\nbooks, but quite another thing to make a popular lecture out of them.\nNevertheless I must not flinch from my task here, for I think that\nthis particular point forms perhaps the vital knot of the present\nphilosophic situation, and I imagine that the times are ripe, or\nalmost ripe, for a serious attempt to be made at its untying.\nIt may perhaps help to lessen the arduousness of the subject if I put\nthe first part of what I have to say in the form of a direct personal\nconfession.\nIn the year 1890 I published a work on psychology in which it became\nmy duty to discuss the value of a certain explanation of our higher\nmental states that had come into favor among the more biologically\ninclined psychologists. Suggested partly by the association of ideas,\nand partly by the analogy of chemical compounds, this opinion was\nthat complex mental states are resultants of the self-compounding of\nsimpler ones. The Mills had spoken of mental chemistry; Wundt of a\n'psychic synthesis,' which might develop properties not contained in\nthe elements; and such writers as Spencer, Taine, Fiske, Barratt, and\nClifford had propounded a great evolutionary theory in which, in the\nabsence of souls, selves, or other principles of unity, primordial\nunits of mind-stuff or mind-dust were represented as summing\nthemselves together in successive stages of compounding and\nre-compounding, and thus engendering our higher and more complex\nstates of mind. The elementary feeling of A, let us say, and the\nelementary feeling of B, when they occur in certain conditions,\ncombine, according to this doctrine, into a feeling of A-plus-B, and\nthis in turn combines with a similarly generated feeling of C-plus-D,\nuntil at last the whole alphabet may appear together in one field of\nawareness, without any other witnessing principle or principles beyond\nthe feelings of the several letters themselves, being supposed to\nexist. What each of them witnesses separately, 'all' of them are\nsupposed to witness in conjunction. But their distributive knowledge\ndoesn't _give rise_ to their collective knowledge by any act, it _is_\ntheir collective knowledge. The lower forms of consciousness 'taken\ntogether' _are_ the higher. It, 'taken apart,' consists of nothing\nand _is_ nothing but them. This, at least, is the most obvious way\nof understanding the doctrine, and is the way I understood it in the\nchapter in my psychology.\nSuperficially looked at, this seems just like the combination of H_2\nand O into water, but looked at more closely, the analogy halts badly.\nWhen a chemist tells us that two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen\ncombine themselves of their own accord into the new compound substance\n'water,' he knows (if he believes in the mechanical view of nature)\nthat this is only an elliptical statement for a more complex fact.\nThat fact is that when H_2 and O, instead of keeping far apart, get\ninto closer quarters, say into the position H-O-H, they _affect\nsurrounding bodies differently_: they now wet our skin, dissolve\nsugar, put out fire, etc., which they didn't in their former\npositions. 'Water' is but _our name_ for what acts thus peculiarly.\nBut if the skin, sugar, and fire were absent, no witness would speak\nof water at all. He would still talk of the H and O distributively,\nmerely noting that they acted now in the new position H-O-H.\nIn the older psychologies the soul or self took the place of the\nsugar, fire, or skin. The lower feelings produced _effects on it_,\nand their apparent compounds were only its reactions. As you tickle\na man's face with a feather, and he laughs, so when you tickle his\nintellectual principle with a retinal feeling, say, and a muscular\nfeeling at once, it laughs responsively by its category of 'space,'\nbut it would be false to treat the space as simply made of those\nsimpler feelings. It is rather a new and unique psychic creation which\ntheir combined action on the mind is able to evoke.\nI found myself obliged, in discussing the mind-dust theory, to urge\nthis last alternative view. The so-called mental compounds are simple\npsychic reactions of a higher type. The form itself of them, I said,\nis something new. We can't say that awareness of the alphabet as\nsuch is nothing more than twenty-six awarenesses, each of a separate\nletter; for those are twenty-six distinct awarenesses, of single\nletters _without_ others, while their so-called sum is one awareness,\nof every letter _with_ its comrades. There is thus something new in\nthe collective consciousness. It knows the same letters, indeed, but\nit knows them in this novel way. It is safer, I said (for I fought shy\nof admitting a self or soul or other agent of combination), to treat\nthe consciousness of the alphabet as a twenty-seventh fact, the\nsubstitute and not the sum of the twenty-six simpler consciousnesses,\nand to say that while under certain physiological conditions they\nalone are produced, other more complex physiological conditions result\nin its production instead. Do not talk, therefore, I said, of the\nhigher states _consisting_ of the simpler, or _being_ the same with\nthem; talk rather of their _knowing the same things_. They are\ndifferent mental facts, but they apprehend, each in its own peculiar\nway, the same objective A, B, C, and D.\nThe theory of combination, I was forced to conclude, is thus\nuntenable, being both logically nonsensical and practically\nunnecessary. Say what you will, twelve thoughts, each of a single\nword, are not the self-same mental thing as one thought of the whole\nsentence. The higher thoughts, I insisted, are psychic units, not\ncompounds; but for all that, they may know together as a collective\nmultitude the very same objects which under other conditions are known\nseparately by as many simple thoughts.\nFor many years I held rigorously to this view,[3] and the reasons for\ndoing so seemed to me during all those years to apply also to the\nopinion that the absolute mind stands to our minds in the relation of\na whole to its parts. If untenable in finite psychology, that opinion\nought to be untenable in metaphysics also. The great transcendentalist\nmetaphor has always been, as I lately reminded you, a grammatical\nsentence. Physically such a sentence is of course composed of clauses,\nthese of words, the words of syllables, and the syllables of letters.\nWe may take each word in, yet not understand the sentence; but if\nsuddenly the meaning of the whole sentence flashes, the sense of each\nword is taken up into that whole meaning. Just so, according to\nour transcendentalist teachers, the absolute mind thinks the whole\nsentence, while we, according to our rank as thinkers, think a clause,\na word, a syllable, or a letter. Most of us are, as I said, mere\nsyllables in the mouth of Allah. And as Allah comes first in the order\nof being, so comes first the entire sentence, the _logos_ that forms\nthe eternal absolute thought. Students of language tell us that speech\nbegan with men's efforts to make _statements_. The rude synthetic\nvocal utterances first used for this effect slowly got stereotyped,\nand then much later got decomposed into grammatical parts. It is not\nas if men had first invented letters and made syllables of them, then\nmade words of the syllables and sentences of the words;--they actually\nfollowed the reverse order. So, the transcendentalists affirm, the\ncomplete absolute thought is the pre-condition of our thoughts, and\nwe finite creatures _are_ only in so far as it owns us as its verbal\nfragments.\nThe metaphor is so beautiful, and applies, moreover, so literally to\nsuch a multitude of the minor wholes of experience, that by merely\nhearing it most of us are convinced that it must apply universally.\nWe see that no smallest raindrop can come into being without a whole\nshower, no single feather without a whole bird, neck and crop, beak\nand tail, coming into being simultaneously: so we unhesitatingly lay\ndown the law that no part of anything can be except so far as the\nwhole also is. And then, since everything whatever is part of the\nwhole universe, and since (if we are idealists) nothing, whether part\nor whole, exists except for a witness, we proceed to the conclusion\nthat the unmitigated absolute as witness of the whole is the one sole\nground of being of every partial fact, the fact of our own existence\nincluded. We think of ourselves as being only a few of the feathers,\nso to speak, which help to constitute that absolute bird. Extending\nthe analogy of certain wholes, of which we have familiar experience,\nto the whole of wholes, we easily become absolute idealists.\nBut if, instead of yielding to the seductions of our metaphor, be\nit sentence, shower, or bird, we analyze more carefully the notion\nsuggested by it that we are constituent parts of the absolute's\neternal field of consciousness, we find grave difficulties arising.\nFirst, the difficulty I found with the mind-dust theory. If the\nabsolute makes us by knowing us, how can we exist otherwise than _as_\nit knows us? But it knows each of us indivisibly from everything else.\nYet if to exist means nothing but to be experienced, as idealism\naffirms, we surely exist otherwise, for we experience _ourselves_\nignorantly and in division. We indeed differ from the absolute not\nonly by defect, but by excess. Our ignorances, for example, bring\ncuriosities and doubts by which it cannot be troubled, for it owns\neternally the solution of every problem. Our impotence entails pains,\nour imperfection sins, which its perfection keeps at a distance. What\nI said of the alphabet-form and the letters holds good of the absolute\nexperience and our experiences. Their relation, whatever it may be,\nseems not to be that of identity.\nIt is impossible to reconcile the peculiarities of our experience with\nour being only the absolute's mental objects. A God, as distinguished\nfrom the absolute, creates things by projecting them beyond himself as\nso many substances, each endowed with _perseity_, as the scholastics\ncall it. But objects of thought are not things _per se_. They are\nthere only _for_ their thinker, and only _as_ he thinks them. How,\nthen, can they become severally alive on their own accounts and think\nthemselves quite otherwise than as he thinks them? It is as if the\ncharacters in a novel were to get up from the pages, and walk away and\ntransact business of their own outside of the author's story.\nA third difficulty is this: The bird-metaphor is physical, but we\nsee on reflection that in the _physical_ world there is no real\ncompounding. 'Wholes' are not realities there, parts only are\nrealities. 'Bird' is only our _name_ for the physical fact of a\ncertain grouping of organs, just as 'Charles's Wain' is our name for a\ncertain grouping of stars. The 'whole,' be it bird or constellation,\nis nothing but our vision, nothing but an effect on our sensorium when\na lot of things act on it together. It is not realized by any organ\nor any star, or experienced apart from the consciousness of an\nonlooker.[4] In the physical world taken by itself there _is_ thus no\n'all,' there are only the 'eaches'--at least that is the 'scientific'\nview.\nIn the mental world, on the contrary, wholes do in point of fact\nrealize themselves _per se_. The meaning of the whole sentence is\njust as much a real experience as the feeling of each word is; the\nabsolute's experience _is_ for itself, as much as yours is for\nyourself or mine for myself. So the feather-and-bird analogy won't\nwork unless you make the absolute into a distinct sort of mental agent\nwith a vision produced in it _by_ our several minds analogous to the\n'bird'-vision which the feathers, beak, etc., produce _in_ those same\nminds. The 'whole,' which is _its_ experience, would then be its\nunifying reaction on our experiences, and not those very experiences\nself-combined. Such a view as this would go with theism, for the\ntheistic God is a separate being; but it would not go with pantheistic\nidealism, the very essence of which is to insist that we are literally\n_parts_ of God, and he only ourselves in our totality--the word\n'ourselves' here standing of course for all the universe's finite\nfacts.\nI am dragging you into depths unsuitable, I fear, for a rapid lecture.\nSuch difficulties as these have to be teased out with a needle, so to\nspeak, and lecturers should take only bird's-eye views. The practical\nupshot of the matter, however, so far as I am concerned, is this, that\nif I had been lecturing on the absolute a very few years ago, I should\nunhesitatingly have urged these difficulties, and developed them at\nstill greater length, to show that the hypothesis of the absolute\nwas not only non-coercive from the logical point of view, but\nself-contradictory as well, its notion that parts and whole are only\ntwo names for the same thing not bearing critical scrutiny. If you\nstick to purely physical terms like stars, there is no whole. If you\ncall the whole mental, then the so-called whole, instead of being one\nfact with the parts, appears rather as the integral reaction on those\nparts of an independent higher witness, such as the theistic God is\nsupposed to be.\nSo long as this was the state of my own mind, I could accept the\nnotion of self-compounding in the supernal spheres of experience no\nmore easily than in that chapter on mind-dust I had accepted it in\nthe lower spheres. I found myself compelled, therefore, to call\nthe absolute impossible; and the untrammelled freedom with which\npantheistic or monistic idealists stepped over the logical barriers\nwhich Lotze and others had set down long before I had--I had done\nlittle more than quote these previous critics in my chapter--surprised\nme not a little, and made me, I have to confess, both resentful and\nenvious. Envious because in the bottom of my heart I wanted the same\nfreedom myself, for motives which I shall develop later; and resentful\nbecause my absolutist friends seemed to me to be stealing the\nprivilege of blowing both hot and cold. To establish their absolute\nthey used an intellectualist type of logic which they disregarded when\nemployed against it. It seemed to me that they ought at least to have\nmentioned the objections that had stopped me so completely. I had\nyielded to them against my 'will to believe,' out of pure logical\nscrupulosity. They, professing to loathe the will to believe and to\nfollow purest rationality, had simply ignored them. The method was\neasy, but hardly to be called candid. Fechner indeed was candid\nenough, for he had never thought of the objections, but later writers,\nlike Royce, who should presumably have heard them, had passed them by\nin silence. I felt as if these philosophers were granting their will\nto believe in monism too easy a license. My own conscience would\npermit me no such license.\nSo much for the personal confession by which you have allowed me to\nintroduce the subject. Let us now consider it more objectively.\nThe fundamental difficulty I have found is the number of\ncontradictions which idealistic monists seem to disregard. In the\nfirst place they attribute to all existence a mental or experiential\ncharacter, but I find their simultaneous belief that the higher and\nthe lower in the universe are entitatively identical, incompatible\nwith this character. Incompatible in consequence of the generally\naccepted doctrine that, whether Berkeley were right or not in saying\nof material existence that its _esse_ is _sentiri_, it is undoubtedly\nright to say of _mental_ existence that its _esse_ is _sentiri_ or\n_experiri_. If I feel pain, it is just pain that I feel, however I\nmay have come by the feeling. No one pretends that pain as such only\nappears like pain, but in itself is different, for to be as a mental\nexperience _is_ only to appear to some one.\nThe idealists in question ought then to do one of two things, but they\ndo neither. They ought either to refute the notion that as mental\nstates appear, so they are; or, still keeping that notion, they\nought to admit a distinct agent of unification to do the work of\nthe all-knower, just as our respective souls or selves in popular\nphilosophy do the work of partial knowers. Otherwise it is like a\njoint-stock company all shareholders and no treasurer or director. If\nour finite minds formed a billion facts, then its mind, knowing our\nbillion, would make a universe composed of a billion and one facts.\nBut transcendental idealism is quite as unfriendly to active\nprinciples called souls as physiological psychology is, Kant having,\nas it thinks, definitively demolished them. And altho some disciples\nspeak of the transcendental ego of apperception (which they celebrate\nas Kant's most precious legacy to posterity) as if it were a combining\nagent, the drift of monistic authority is certainly in the direction\nof treating it as only an all-witness, whose field of vision we finite\nwitnesses do not cause, but constitute rather. We are the letters, it\nis the alphabet; we are the features, it is the face; not indeed as if\neither alphabet or face were something additional to the letters or\nthe features, but rather as if it were only another name for the very\nletters or features themselves. The all-form assuredly differs from\nthe each-form, but the _matter_ is the same in both, and the each-form\nonly an unaccountable appearance.\nBut this, as you see, contradicts the other idealist principle, of\na mental fact being just what it appears to be. If their forms\nof appearance are so different, the all and the eaches cannot be\nidentical.\nThe way out (unless, indeed, we are willing to discard the logic of\nidentity altogether) would seem to be frankly to write down the all\nand the eaches as two distinct orders of witness, each minor witness\nbeing aware of its own 'content' solely, while the greater witness\nknows the minor witnesses, knows their whole content pooled together,\nknows their relations to one another, and knows of just how much each\none of them is ignorant.\nThe two types of witnessing are here palpably non-identical. We get a\npluralism, not a monism, out of them. In my psychology-chapter I\nhad resorted openly to such pluralism, treating each total field of\nconsciousness as a distinct entity, and maintaining that the higher\nfields merely supersede the lower functionally by knowing more about\nthe same objects.\nThe monists themselves writhe like worms on the hook to escape\npluralistic or at least dualistic language, but they cannot escape it.\nThey speak of the eternal and the temporal 'points of view'; of the\nuniverse in its infinite 'aspect' or in its finite 'capacity'; they\nsay that '_qu\u00e2_ absolute' it is one thing, '_qu\u00e2_ relative' another;\nthey contrast its 'truth' with its appearances; they distinguish the\ntotal from the partial way of 'taking' it, etc.; but they forget that,\non idealistic principles, to make such distinctions is tantamount to\nmaking different beings, or at any rate that varying points of view,\naspects, appearances, ways of taking, and the like, are meaningless\nphrases unless we suppose outside of the unchanging content of reality\na diversity of witnesses who experience or take it variously, the\nabsolute mind being just the witness that takes it most completely.\nFor consider the matter one moment longer, if you can. Ask what this\nnotion implies, of appearing differently from different points of\nview. If there be no outside witness, a thing can appear only to\nitself, the eaches or parts to their several selves temporally, the\nall or whole to itself eternally. Different 'selves' thus break out\ninside of what the absolutist insists to be intrinsically one fact.\nBut how can what is _actually_ one be _effectively_ so many? Put your\nwitnesses anywhere, whether outside or inside of what is witnessed,\nin the last resort your witnesses must on idealistic principles be\ndistinct, for what is witnessed is different.\nI fear that I am expressing myself with terrible obscurity--some of\nyou, I know, are groaning over the logic-chopping. Be a pluralist or\nbe a monist, you say, for heaven's sake, no matter which, so long as\nyou stop arguing. It reminds one of Chesterton's epigram that the only\nthing that ever drives human beings insane is logic. But whether I be\nsane or insane, you cannot fail, even tho you be transcendentalists\nyourselves, to recognize to some degree by my trouble the difficulties\nthat beset monistic idealism. What boots it to call the parts and the\nwhole the same body of experience, when in the same breath you have to\nsay that the all 'as such' means one sort of experience and each part\n'as such' means another?\nDifficulties, then, so far, but no stable solution as yet, for I have\nbeen talking only critically. You will probably be relieved to hear,\nthen, that having rounded this corner, I shall begin to consider what\nmay be the possibilities of getting farther.\nTo clear the path, I beg you first to note one point. What has so\ntroubled my logical conscience is not so much the absolute by itself\nas the whole class of suppositions of which it is the supreme\nexample, collective experiences namely, claiming identity with their\nconstituent parts, yet experiencing things quite differently from\nthese latter. If _any_ such collective experience can be, then of\ncourse, so far as the mere logic of the case goes, the absolute may\nbe. In a previous lecture I have talked against the absolute from\nother points of view. In this lecture I have meant merely to take it\nas the example most prominent at Oxford of the thing which has given\nme such logical perplexity. I don't logically see how a collective\nexperience of any grade whatever can be treated as logically identical\nwith a lot of distributive experiences. They form two different\nconcepts. The absolute happens to be the only collective experience\nconcerning which Oxford idealists have urged the identity, so I took\nit as my prerogative instance. But Fechner's earth-soul, or any stage\nof being below or above that, would have served my purpose just\nas well: the same logical objection applies to these collective\nexperiences as to the absolute.\nSo much, then, in order that you may not be confused about my\nstrategical objective. The real point to defend against the logic that\nI have used is the identity of the collective and distributive anyhow,\nnot the particular example of such identity known as the absolute.\nSo now for the directer question. Shall we say that every complex\nmental fact is a separate psychic entity succeeding upon a lot of\nother psychic entities which are erroneously called its parts, and\nsuperseding them in function, but not literally being composed of\nthem? This was the course I took in my psychology; and if followed in\ntheology, we should have to deny the absolute as usually conceived,\nand replace it by the 'God' of theism. We should also have to deny\nFechner's 'earth-soul' and all other superhuman collections of\nexperience of every grade, so far at least as these are held to be\ncompounded of our simpler souls in the way which Fechner believed\nin; and we should have to make all these denials in the name of the\nincorruptible logic of self-identity, teaching us that to call a thing\nand its other the same is to commit the crime of self-contradiction.\nBut if we realize the whole philosophic situation thus produced,\nwe see that it is almost intolerable. Loyal to the logical kind of\nrationality, it is disloyal to every other kind. It makes the universe\ndiscontinuous. These fields of experience that replace each other\nso punctually, each knowing the same matter, but in ever-widening\ncontexts, from simplest feeling up to absolute knowledge, _can_\nthey have no _being_ in common when their cognitive function is so\nmanifestly common? The regular succession of them is on such terms an\nunintelligible miracle. If you reply that their common _object_ is\nof itself enough to make the many witnesses continuous, the same\nimplacable logic follows you--how _can_ one and the same object appear\nso variously? Its diverse appearances break it into a plurality; and\nour world of objects then falls into discontinuous pieces quite as\nmuch as did our world of subjects. The resultant irrationality is\nreally intolerable.\nI said awhile ago that I was envious of Fechner and the other\npantheists because I myself wanted the same freedom that I saw them\nunscrupulously enjoying, of letting mental fields compound themselves\nand so make the universe more continuous, but that my conscience held\nme prisoner. In my heart of hearts, however, I knew that my situation\nwas absurd and could be only provisional. That secret of a continuous\nlife which the universe knows by heart and acts on every instant\ncannot be a contradiction incarnate. If logic says it is one, so\nmuch the worse for logic. Logic being the lesser thing, the static\nincomplete abstraction, must succumb to reality, not reality to logic.\nOur intelligence cannot wall itself up alive, like a pupa in its\nchrysalis. It must at any cost keep on speaking terms with the\nuniverse that engendered it. Fechner, Royce, and Hegel seem on the\ntruer path. Fechner has never heard of logic's veto, Royce hears the\nvoice but cannily ignores the utterances, Hegel hears them but to\nspurn them--and all go on their way rejoicing. Shall we alone obey the\nveto?\nSincerely, and patiently as I could, I struggled with the problem for\nyears, covering hundreds of sheets of paper with notes and memoranda\nand discussions with myself over the difficulty. How can many\nconsciousnesses be at the same time one consciousness? How can one and\nthe same identical fact experience itself so diversely? The struggle\nwas vain; I found myself in an _impasse_. I saw that I must either\nforswear that 'psychology without a soul' to which my whole\npsychological and kantian education had committed me,--I must, in\nshort, bring back distinct spiritual agents to know the mental states,\nnow singly and now in combination, in a word bring back scholasticism\nand common sense--or else I must squarely confess the solution of\nthe problem impossible, and then either give up my intellectualistic\nlogic, the logic of identity, and adopt some higher (or lower) form\nof rationality, or, finally, face the fact that life is logically\nirrational.\nSincerely, this is the actual trilemma that confronts every one of us.\nThose of you who are scholastic-minded, or simply common-sense minded,\nwill smile at the elaborate groans of my parturient mountain resulting\nin nothing but this mouse. Accept the spiritual agents, for heaven's\nsake, you will say, and leave off your ridiculous pedantry. Let but\nour 'souls' combine our sensations by their intellectual faculties,\nand let but 'God' replace the pantheistic world-soul, and your wheels\nwill go round again--you will enjoy both life and logic together.\nThis solution is obvious and I know that many of you will adopt it. It\nis comfortable, and all our habits of speech support it. Yet it is not\nfor idle or fantastical reasons that the notion of the substantial\nsoul, so freely used by common men and the more popular philosophies,\nhas fallen upon such evil days, and has no prestige in the eyes of\ncritical thinkers. It only shares the fate of other unrepresentable\nsubstances and principles. They are without exception all so barren\nthat to sincere inquirers they appear as little more than names\nmasquerading--Wo die begriffe fehlen da stellt ein wort zur rechten\nzeit sich ein. You see no deeper into the fact that a hundred\nsensations get compounded or known together by thinking that a 'soul'\ndoes the compounding than you see into a man's living eighty years by\nthinking of him as an octogenarian, or into our having five fingers by\ncalling us pentadactyls. Souls have worn out both themselves and\ntheir welcome, that is the plain truth. Philosophy ought to get the\nmanifolds of experience unified on principles less empty. Like the\nword 'cause,' the word 'soul' is but a theoretic stop-gap--it marks a\nplace and claims it for a future explanation to occupy.\nThis being our post-humian and post-kantian state of mind, I will ask\nyour permission to leave the soul wholly out of the present discussion\nand to consider only the residual dilemma. Some day, indeed, souls may\nget their innings again in philosophy--I am quite ready to admit that\npossibility--they form a category of thought too natural to the human\nmind to expire without prolonged resistance. But if the belief in the\nsoul ever does come to life after the many funeral-discourses which\nhumian and kantian criticism have preached over it, I am sure it will\nbe only when some one has found in the term a pragmatic significance\nthat has hitherto eluded observation. When that champion speaks, as\nhe well may speak some day, it will be time to consider souls more\nseriously.\nLet us leave out the soul, then, and confront what I just called\nthe residual dilemma. Can we, on the one hand, give up the logic\nof identity?--can we, on the other, believe human experience to be\nfundamentally irrational? Neither is easy, yet it would seem that we\nmust do one or the other.\nFew philosophers have had the frankness fairly to admit the necessity\nof choosing between the 'horns' offered. Reality must be rational,\nthey have said, and since the ordinary intellectualist logic is\nthe only usual test of rationality, reality and logic must agree\n'somehow.' Hegel was the first non-mystical writer to face the\ndilemma squarely and throw away the ordinary logic, saving a\npseudo-rationality for the universe by inventing the higher logic of\nthe 'dialectic process.' Bradley holds to the intellectualist logic,\nand by dint of it convicts the human universe of being irrationality\nincarnate. But what must be and can be, is, he says; there must and\ncan be relief from _that_ irrationality; and the absolute must already\nhave got the relief in secret ways of its own, impossible for us to\nguess at. _We_ of course get no relief, so Bradley's is a rather\nascetic doctrine. Royce and Taylor accept similar solutions, only they\nemphasize the irrationality of our finite universe less than Bradley\ndoes; and Royce in particular, being unusually 'thick' for an\nidealist, tries to bring the absolute's secret forms of relief more\nsympathetically home to our imagination.\nWell, what must we do in this tragic predicament? For my own part, I\nhave finally found myself compelled to _give up the logic_, fairly,\nsquarely, and irrevocably. It has an imperishable use in human life,\nbut that use is not to make us theoretically acquainted with the\nessential nature of reality--just what it is I can perhaps suggest\nto you a little later. Reality, life, experience, concreteness,\nimmediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows and\nsurrounds it. If you like to employ words eulogistically, as most\nmen do, and so encourage confusion, you may say that reality obeys a\nhigher logic, or enjoys a higher rationality. But I think that\neven eulogistic words should be used rather to distinguish than\nto commingle meanings, so I prefer bluntly to call reality if not\nirrational then at least non-rational in its constitution,--and by\nreality here I mean reality where things _happen_, all temporal\nreality without exception. I myself find no good warrant for even\nsuspecting the existence of any reality of a higher denomination than\nthat distributed and strung-along and flowing sort of reality which we\nfinite beings swim in. That is the sort of reality given us, and that\nis the sort with which logic is so incommensurable. If there be any\nhigher sort of reality--the 'absolute,' for example--that sort, by\nthe confession of those who believe in it, is still less amenable\nto ordinary logic; it transcends logic and is therefore still less\nrational in the intellectualist sense, so it cannot help us to save\nour logic as an adequate definer and confiner of existence.\nThese sayings will sound queer and dark, probably they will sound\nquite wild or childish in the absence of explanatory comment. Only the\npersuasion that I soon can explain them, if not satisfactorily to all\nof you, at least intelligibly, emboldens me to state them thus baldly\nas a sort of programme. Please take them as a thesis, therefore, to be\ndefended by later pleading.\nI told you that I had long and sincerely wrestled with the dilemma. I\nhave now to confess (and this will probably re-animate your interest)\nthat I should not now be emancipated, not now subordinate logic with\nso very light a heart, or throw it out of the deeper regions of\nphilosophy to take its rightful and respectable place in the world of\nsimple human practice, if I had not been influenced by a comparatively\nyoung and very original french writer, Professor Henri Bergson.\nReading his works is what has made me bold. If I had not read\nBergson, I should probably still be blackening endless pages of paper\nprivately, in the hope of making ends meet that were never meant to\nmeet, and trying to discover some mode of conceiving the behavior of\nreality which should leave no discrepancy between it and the accepted\nlaws of the logic of identity. It is certain, at any rate, that\nwithout the confidence which being able to lean on Bergson's authority\ngives me I should never have ventured to urge these particular views\nof mine upon this ultra-critical audience.\nI must therefore, in order to make my own views more intelligible,\ngive some preliminary account of the bergsonian philosophy. But here,\nas in Fechner's case, I must confine myself only to the features\nthat are essential to the present purpose, and not entangle you in\ncollateral details, however interesting otherwise. For our present\npurpose, then, the essential contribution of Bergson to philosophy\nis his criticism of intellectualism. In my opinion he has killed\nintellectualism definitively and without hope of recovery. I don't\nsee how it can ever revive again in its ancient platonizing r\u00f4le of\nclaiming to be the most authentic, intimate, and exhaustive definer\nof the nature of reality. Others, as Kant for example, have denied\nintellectualism's pretensions to define reality _an sich_ or in its\nabsolute capacity; but Kant still leaves it laying down laws--and laws\nfrom which there is no appeal--to all our human experience; while what\nBergson denies is that its methods give any adequate account of this\nhuman experience in its very finiteness. Just how Bergson accomplishes\nall this I must try to tell in my imperfect way in the next lecture;\nbut since I have already used the words 'logic,' 'logic of identity,\nintellectualistic logic,' and 'intellectualism' so often, and\nsometimes used them as if they required no particular explanation, it\nwill be wise at this point to say at greater length than heretofore in\nwhat sense I take these terms when I claim that Bergson has refuted\ntheir pretension to decide what reality can or cannot be. Just what I\nmean by intellectualism is therefore what I shall try to give a fuller\nidea of during the remainder of this present hour.\nIn recent controversies some participants have shown resentment\nat being classed as intellectualists. I mean to use the word\ndisparagingly, but shall be sorry if it works offence. Intellectualism\nhas its source in the faculty which gives us our chief superiority to\nthe brutes, our power, namely, of translating the crude flux of our\nmerely feeling-experience into a conceptual order. An immediate\nexperience, as yet unnamed or classed, is a mere _that_ that we\nundergo, a thing that asks, '_What_ am I?' When we name and class it,\nwe say for the first time what it is, and all these whats are abstract\nnames or concepts. Each concept means a particular _kind_ of thing,\nand as things seem once for all to have been created in kinds, a far\nmore efficient handling of a given bit of experience begins as soon as\nwe have classed the various parts of it. Once classed, a thing can be\ntreated by the law of its class, and the advantages are endless. Both\ntheoretically and practically this power of framing abstract concepts\nis one of the sublimest of our human prerogatives. We come back\ninto the concrete from our journey into these abstractions, with an\nincrease both of vision and of power. It is no wonder that earlier\nthinkers, forgetting that concepts are only man-made extracts from the\ntemporal flux, should have ended by treating them as a superior type\nof being, bright, changeless, true, divine, and utterly opposed in\nnature to the turbid, restless lower world. The latter then appears as\nbut their corruption and falsification.\nIntellectualism in the vicious sense began when Socrates and Plato\ntaught that what a thing really is, is told us by its _definition_.\nEver since Socrates we have been taught that reality consists of\nessences, not of appearances, and that the essences of things are\nknown whenever we know their definitions. So first we identify\nthe thing with a concept and then we identify the concept with a\ndefinition, and only then, inasmuch as the thing _is_ whatever the\ndefinition expresses, are we sure of apprehending the real essence of\nit or the full truth about it.\nSo far no harm is done. The misuse of concepts begins with the habit\nof employing them privatively as well as positively, using them not\nmerely to assign properties to things, but to deny the very properties\nwith which the things sensibly present themselves. Logic can extract\nall its possible consequences from any definition, and the logician\nwho is _unerbittlich consequent_ is often tempted, when he cannot\nextract a certain property from a definition, to deny that the\nconcrete object to which the definition applies can possibly possess\nthat property. The definition that fails to yield it must exclude or\nnegate it. This is Hegel's regular method of establishing his system.\nIt is but the old story, of a useful practice first becoming a method,\nthen a habit, and finally a tyranny that defeats the end it was used\nfor. Concepts, first employed to make things intelligible, are clung\nto even when they make them unintelligible. Thus it comes that when\nonce you have conceived things as 'independent,' you must proceed to\ndeny the possibility of any connexion whatever among them, because\nthe notion of connexion is not contained in the definition of\nindependence. For a like reason you must deny any possible forms or\nmodes of unity among things which you have begun by defining as a\n'many.' We have cast a glance at Hegel's and Bradley's use of this\nsort of reasoning, and you will remember Sigwart's epigram that\naccording to it a horseman can never in his life go on foot, or a\nphotographer ever do anything but photograph.\nThe classic extreme in this direction is the denial of the possibility\nof change, and the consequent branding of the world of change as\nunreal, by certain philosophers. The definition of A is changeless,\nso is the definition of B. The one definition cannot change into\nthe other, so the notion that a concrete thing A should change into\nanother concrete thing B is made Out to be contrary to reason. In Mr.\nBradley's difficulty in seeing how sugar can be sweet intellectualism\noutstrips itself and becomes openly a sort of verbalism. Sugar is just\nsugar and sweet is just sweet; neither is the other; nor can the\nword 'is' ever be understood to join any subject to its predicate\nrationally. Nothing 'between' things can connect them, for 'between'\nis just that third thing, 'between,' and would need itself to be\nconnected to the first and second things by two still finer betweens,\nand so on ad infinitum.\nThe particular intellectualistic difficulty that had held my own\nthought so long in a vise was, as we have seen at such tedious length,\nthe impossibility of understanding how 'your' experience and 'mine,'\nwhich 'as such' are defined as not conscious of each other, can\nnevertheless at the same time be members of a world-experience defined\nexpressly as having all its parts co-conscious, or known together. The\ndefinitions are contradictory, so the things defined can in no way be\nunited. You see how unintelligible intellectualism here seems to make\nthe world of our most accomplished philosophers. Neither as they\nuse it nor as we use it does it do anything but make nature look\nirrational and seem impossible.\nIn my next lecture, using Bergson as my principal topic, I shall enter\ninto more concrete details and try, by giving up intellectualism\nfrankly, to make, if not the world, at least my own general thesis,\nless unintelligible.\nLECTURE VI\nBERGSON AND HIS CRITIQUE OF INTELLECTUALISM\nI gave you a very stiff lecture last time, and I fear that this one\ncan be little less so. The best way of entering into it will be to\nbegin immediately with Bergson's philosophy, since I told you that\nthat was what had led me personally to renounce the intellectualistic\nmethod and the current notion that logic is an adequate measure of\nwhat can or cannot be.\nProfessor Henri Bergson is a young man, comparatively, as influential\nphilosophers go, having been born at Paris in 1859. His career has\nbeen the perfectly routine one of a successful french professor.\nEntering the \u00e9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure at the age of twenty-two, he\nspent the next seventeen years teaching at _lyc\u00e9es_, provincial or\nparisian, until his fortieth year, when he was made professor at the\nsaid \u00e9cole normale. Since 1900 he has been professor at the College de\nFrance, and member of the Institute since 1900. So far as the outward\nfacts go, Bergson's career has then been commonplace to the utmost.\nNeither one of Taine's famous principles of explanation of great\nmen, _the race, the environment, or the moment_, no, nor all three\ntogether, will explain that peculiar way of looking at things that\nconstitutes his mental individuality. Originality in men dates from\nnothing previous, other things date from it, rather. I have to confess\nthat Bergson's originality is so profuse that many of his ideas baffle\nme entirely. I doubt whether any one understands him all over, so to\nspeak; and I am sure that he would himself be the first to see that\nthis must be, and to confess that things which he himself has not yet\nthought out clearly, had yet to be mentioned and have a tentative\nplace assigned them in his philosophy. Many of us are profusely\noriginal, in that no man can understand us--violently peculiar ways\nof looking at things are no great rarity. The rarity is when great\npeculiarity of vision is allied with great lucidity and unusual\ncommand of all the classic expository apparatus. Bergson's resources\nin the way of erudition are remarkable, and in the way of expression\nthey are simply phenomenal. This is why in France, where _l'art de\nbien dire_ counts for so much and is so sure of appreciation, he has\nimmediately taken so eminent a place in public esteem. Old-fashioned\nprofessors, whom his ideas quite fail to satisfy, nevertheless speak\nof his talent almost with bated breath, while the youngsters flock to\nhim as to a master.\nIf anything can make hard things easy to follow, it is a style like\nBergson's. A 'straightforward' style, an american reviewer lately\ncalled it; failing to see that such straightforwardness means a\nflexibility of verbal resource that follows the thought without a\ncrease or wrinkle, as elastic silk underclothing follows the movements\nof one's body. The lucidity of Bergson's way of putting things is what\nall readers are first struck by. It seduces you and bribes you in\nadvance to become his disciple. It is a miracle, and he a real\nmagician.\nM. Bergson, if I am rightly informed, came into philosophy through the\ngateway of mathematics. The old antinomies of the infinite were,\nI imagine, the irritant that first woke his faculties from their\ndogmatic slumber. You all remember Zeno's famous paradox, or sophism,\nas many of our logic books still call it, of Achilles and the\ntortoise. Give that reptile ever so small an advance and the swift\nrunner Achilles can never overtake him, much less get ahead of him;\nfor if space and time are infinitely divisible (as our intellects\ntell us they must be), by the time Achilles reaches the tortoise's\nstarting-point, the tortoise has already got ahead of _that_\nstarting-point, and so on _ad infinitum_, the interval between the\npursuer and the pursued growing endlessly minuter, but never becoming\nwholly obliterated. The common way of showing up the sophism here is\nby pointing out the ambiguity of the expression 'never can overtake.'\nWhat the word 'never' falsely suggests, it is said, is an infinite\nduration of time; what it really means is the inexhaustible number of\nthe steps of which the overtaking must consist. But if these steps are\ninfinitely short, a finite time will suffice for them; and in point of\nfact they do rapidly converge, whatever be the original interval\nor the contrasted speeds, toward infinitesimal shortness. This\nproportionality of the shortness of the times to that of the spaces\nrequired frees us, it is claimed, from the sophism which the word\n'never' suggests.\nBut this criticism misses Zeno's point entirely. Zeno would have been\nperfectly willing to grant that if the tortoise can be overtaken at\nall, he can be overtaken in (say) twenty seconds, but he would still\nhave insisted that he can't be overtaken at all. Leave Achilles and\nthe tortoise out of the account altogether, he would have said--they\ncomplicate the case unnecessarily. Take any single process of change\nwhatever, take the twenty seconds themselves elapsing. If time be\ninfinitely divisible, and it must be so on intellectualist principles,\nthey simply cannot elapse, their end cannot be reached; for no matter\nhow much of them has already elapsed, before the remainder, however\nminute, can have wholly elapsed, the earlier half of it must first\nhave elapsed. And this ever re-arising need of making the earlier half\nelapse _first_ leaves time with always something to do _before_ the\nlast thing is done, so that the last thing never gets done. Expressed\nin bare numbers, it is like the convergent series 1/2 plus 1/4 plus\n1/8..., of which the limit is one. But this limit, simply because it\nis a limit, stands outside the series, the value of which approaches\nit indefinitely but never touches it. If in the natural world there\nwere no other way of getting things save by such successive addition\nof their logically involved fractions, no complete units or whole\nthings would ever come into being, for the fractions' sum would always\nleave a remainder. But in point of fact nature doesn't make eggs by\nmaking first half an egg, then a quarter, then an eighth, etc., and\nadding them together. She either makes a whole egg at once or none\nat all, and so of all her other units. It is only in the sphere of\nchange, then, where one phase of a thing must needs come into being\nbefore another phase can come that Zeno's paradox gives trouble.\nAnd it gives trouble then only if the succession of steps of change\nbe infinitely divisible. If a bottle had to be emptied by an infinite\nnumber of successive decrements, it is mathematically impossible that\nthe emptying should ever positively terminate. In point of fact,\nhowever, bottles and coffee-pots empty themselves by a finite number\nof decrements, each of definite amount. Either a whole drop emerges or\nnothing emerges from the spout. If all change went thus drop-wise,\nso to speak, if real time sprouted or grew by units of duration of\ndeterminate amount, just as our perceptions of it grow by pulses,\nthere would be no zenonian paradoxes or kantian antinomies to trouble\nus. All our sensible experiences, as we get them immediately, do thus\nchange by discrete pulses of perception, each of which keeps us saying\n'more, more, more,' or 'less, less, less,' as the definite increments\nor diminutions make themselves felt. The discreteness is still more\nobvious when, instead of old things changing, they cease, or when\naltogether new things come. Fechner's term of the 'threshold,' which\nhas played such a part in the psychology of perception, is only one\nway of naming the quantitative discreteness in the change of all our\nsensible experiences. They come to us in drops. Time itself comes in\ndrops.\nOur ideal decomposition of the drops which are all that we feel into\nstill finer fractions is but an incident in that great transformation\nof the perceptual order into a conceptual order of which I spoke in\nmy last lecture. It is made in the interest of our rationalizing\nintellect solely. The times directly _felt_ in the experiences of\nliving subjects have originally no common measure. Let a lump of sugar\nmelt in a glass, to use one of M. Bergson's instances. We feel the\ntime to be long while waiting for the process to end, but who knows\nhow long or how short it feels to the sugar? All _felt_ times coexist\nand overlap or compenetrate each other thus vaguely, but the artifice\nof plotting them on a common scale helps us to reduce their aboriginal\nconfusion, and it helps us still more to plot, against the same scale,\nthe successive possible steps into which nature's various changes may\nbe resolved, either sensibly or conceivably. We thus straighten out\nthe aboriginal privacy and vagueness, and can date things publicly, as\nit were, and by each other. The notion of one objective and 'evenly\nflowing' time, cut into numbered instants, applies itself as a common\nmeasure to all the steps and phases, no matter how many, into which we\ncut the processes of nature. They are now definitely contemporary,\nor later or earlier one than another, and we can handle them\nmathematically, as we say, and far better, practically as well as\ntheoretically, for having thus correlated them one to one with each\nother on the common schematic or conceptual time-scale.\nMotion, to take a good example, is originally a turbid sensation, of\nwhich the native shape is perhaps best preserved in the phenomenon of\nvertigo. In vertigo we feel that movement _is_, and is more or less\nviolent or rapid, more or less in this direction or that, more or less\nalarming or sickening. But a man subject to vertigo may gradually\nlearn to co-ordinate his felt motion with his real position and that\nof other things, and intellectualize it enough to succeed at last in\nwalking without staggering. The mathematical mind similarly organizes\nmotion in its way, putting it into a logical definition: motion is now\nconceived as 'the occupancy of serially successive points of space\nat serially successive instants of time.' With such a definition we\nescape wholly from the turbid privacy of sense. But do we not also\nescape from sense-reality altogether? Whatever motion really may be,\nit surely is not static; but the definition we have gained is of the\nabsolutely static. It gives a set of one-to-one relations between\nspace-points and time-points, which relations themselves are as fixed\nas the points are. It gives _positions_ assignable ad infinitum, but\nhow the body gets from one position to another it omits to mention.\nThe body gets there by moving, of course; but the conceived positions,\nhowever numerously multiplied, contain no element of movement, so\nZeno, using nothing but them in his discussion, has no alternative\nbut to say that our intellect repudiates motion as a non-reality.\nIntellectualism here does what I said it does--it makes experience\nless instead of more intelligible.\nWe of course need a stable scheme of concepts, stably related with\none another, to lay hold of our experiences and to co-ordinate them\nwithal. When an experience comes with sufficient saliency to stand\nout, we keep the thought of it for future use, and store it in our\nconceptual system. What does not of itself stand out, we learn to\n_cut_ out; so the system grows completer, and new reality, as it\ncomes, gets named after and conceptually strung upon this or that\nelement of it which we have already established. The immutability\nof such an abstract system is its great practical merit; the same\nidentical terms and relations in it can always be recovered and\nreferred to--change itself is just such an unalterable concept. But\nall these abstract concepts are but as flowers gathered, they are only\nmoments dipped out from the stream of time, snap-shots taken, as by\na kinetoscopic camera, at a life that in its original coming is\ncontinuous. Useful as they are as samples of the garden, or to\nre-enter the stream with, or to insert in our revolving lantern, they\nhave no value but these practical values. You cannot explain by them\nwhat makes any single phenomenon be or go--you merely dot out the path\nof appearances which it traverses. For you cannot make continuous\nbeing out of discontinuities, and your concepts are discontinuous. The\nstages into which you analyze a change are _states_, the change itself\ngoes on between them. It lies along their intervals, inhabits what\nyour definition fails to gather up, and thus eludes conceptual\nexplanation altogether.\n'When the mathematician,' Bergson writes, 'calculates the state of\na system at the end of a time _t_, nothing need prevent him from\nsupposing that betweenwhiles the universe vanishes, in order suddenly\nto appear again at the due moment in the new configuration. It is\nonly the _t_-th moment that counts--that which flows throughout the\nintervals, namely real time, plays no part in his calculation.... In\nshort, the world on which the mathematician operates is a world which\ndies and is born anew at every instant, like the world which Descartes\nthought of when he spoke of a continued creation.' To know adequately\nwhat really _happens_ we ought, Bergson insists, to see into the\nintervals, but the mathematician sees only their extremities. He\nfixes only a few results, he dots a curve and then interpolates, he\nsubstitutes a tracing for a reality.\nThis being so undeniably the case, the history of the way in which\nphilosophy has dealt with it is curious. The ruling tradition in\nphilosophy has always been the platonic and aristotelian belief that\nfixity is a nobler and worthier thing than change. Reality must be one\nand unalterable. Concepts, being themselves fixities, agree best with\nthis fixed nature of truth, so that for any knowledge of ours to be\nquite true it must be knowledge by universal concepts rather than\nby particular experiences, for these notoriously are mutable and\ncorruptible. This is the tradition known as rationalism in philosophy,\nand what I have called intellectualism is only the extreme application\nof it. In spite of sceptics and empiricists, in spite of Protagoras,\nHume, and James Mill, rationalism has never been seriously questioned,\nfor its sharpest critics have always had a tender place in their\nhearts for it, and have obeyed some of its mandates. They have not\nbeen consistent; they have played fast and loose with the enemy; and\nBergson alone has been radical.\nTo show what I mean by this, let me contrast his procedure with that\nof some of the transcendentalist philosophers whom I have lately\nmentioned. Coming after Kant, these pique themselves on being\n'critical,' on building in fact upon Kant's 'critique' of pure reason.\nWhat that critique professed to establish was this, that concepts do\nnot apprehend reality, but only such appearances as our senses\nfeed out to them. They give immutable intellectual forms to these\nappearances, it is true, but the reality _an sich_ from which in\nultimate resort the sense-appearances have to come remains forever\nunintelligible to our intellect. Take motion, for example. Sensibly,\nmotion comes in drops, waves, or pulses; either some actual amount of\nit, or none, being apprehended. This amount is the datum or _gabe_\nwhich reality feeds out to our intellectual faculty; but our intellect\nmakes of it a task or _aufgabe_--this pun is one of the most memorable\nof Kant's formulas--and insists that in every pulse of it an infinite\nnumber of successive minor pulses shall be ascertainable. These minor\npulses _we_ can indeed _go on_ to ascertain or to compute indefinitely\nif we have patience; but it would contradict the definition of an\ninfinite number to suppose the endless series of them to have actually\ncounted _themselves_ out piecemeal. Zeno made this manifest; so the\ninfinity which our intellect requires of the sense-datum is thus\na future and potential rather than a past and actual infinity of\nstructure. The datum after it has made itself must be decompos_able_\nad infinitum by our conception, but of the steps by which that\nstructure actually got composed we know nothing. Our intellect casts,\nin short, no ray of light on the processes by which experiences _get\nmade_.\nKant's monistic successors have in general found the data of immediate\nexperience even more self-contradictory, when intellectually treated,\nthan Kant did. Not only the character of infinity involved in the\nrelation of various empirical data to their 'conditions,' but the very\nnotion that empirical things should be related to one another at all,\nhas seemed to them, when the intellectualistic fit was upon them, full\nof paradox and contradiction. We saw in a former lecture numerous\ninstances of this from Hegel, Bradley, Royce, and others. We saw also\nwhere the solution of such an intolerable state of things was sought\nfor by these authors. Whereas Kant had placed it outside of and\n_before_ our experience, in the _dinge an sich_ which are the causes\nof the latter, his monistic successors all look for it either _after_\nexperience, as its absolute completion, or else consider it to be even\nnow implicit within experience as its ideal signification. Kant and\nhis successors look, in short, in diametrically opposite directions.\nDo not be misled by Kant's admission of theism into his system.\nHis God is the ordinary dualistic God of Christianity, to whom his\nphilosophy simply opens the door; he has nothing whatsoever in common\nwith the 'absolute spirit' set up by his successors. So far as this\nabsolute spirit is logically derived from Kant, it is not from his\nGod, but from entirely different elements of his philosophy. First\nfrom his notion that an unconditioned totality of the conditions of\nany experience must be assignable; and then from his other notion that\nthe presence of some witness, or ego of apperception, is the most\nuniversal of all the conditions in question. The post-kantians make\nof the witness-condition what is called a concrete universal, an\nindividualized all-witness or world-self, which shall imply in its\nrational constitution each and all of the other conditions put\ntogether, and therefore necessitate each and all of the conditioned\nexperiences.\nAbridgments like this of other men's opinions are very unsatisfactory,\nthey always work injustice; but in this case those of you who are\nfamiliar with the literature will see immediately what I have in mind;\nand to the others, if there be any here, it will suffice to say that\nwhat I am trying so pedantically to point out is only the fact that\nmonistic idealists after Kant have invariably sought relief from the\nsupposed contradictions of our world of sense by looking forward\ntoward an _ens rationis_ conceived as its integration or logical\ncompletion, while he looked backward toward non-rational _dinge an\nsich_ conceived as its cause. Pluralistic empiricists, on the other\nhand, have remained in the world of sense, either na\u00efvely and because\nthey overlooked the intellectualistic contradictions, or because, not\nable to ignore them, they thought they could refute them by a superior\nuse of the same intellectualistic logic. Thus it is that John Mill\npretends to refute the Achilles-tortoise fallacy.\nThe important point to notice here is the intellectualist logic. Both\nsides treat it as authoritative, but they do so capriciously: the\nabsolutists smashing the world of sense by its means, the empiricists\nsmashing the absolute--for the absolute, they say, is the quintessence\nof all logical contradictions. Neither side attains consistency.\nThe Hegelians have to invoke a higher logic to supersede the purely\ndestructive efforts of their first logic. The empiricists use their\nlogic against the absolute, but refuse to use it against finite\nexperience. Each party uses it or drops it to suit the vision it has\nfaith in, but neither impugns in principle its general theoretic\nauthority.\nBergson alone challenges its theoretic authority in principle. He\nalone denies that mere conceptual logic can tell us what is impossible\nor possible in the world of being or fact; and he does so for reasons\nwhich at the same time that they rule logic out from lordship over the\nwhole of life, establish a vast and definite sphere of influence where\nits sovereignty is indisputable. Bergson's own text, felicitous as\nit is, is too intricate for quotation, so I must use my own inferior\nwords in explaining what I mean by saying this.\nIn the first place, logic, giving primarily the relations between\nconcepts as such, and the relations between natural facts only\nsecondarily or so far as the facts have been already identified with\nconcepts and defined by them, must of course stand or fall with the\nconceptual method. But the conceptual method is a transformation which\nthe flux of life undergoes at our hands in the interests of practice\nessentially and only subordinately in the interests of theory. We\nlive forward, we understand backward, said a danish writer; and to\nunderstand life by concepts is to arrest its movement, cutting it up\ninto bits as if with scissors, and immobilizing these in our logical\nherbarium where, comparing them as dried specimens, we can ascertain\nwhich of them statically includes or excludes which other. This\ntreatment supposes life to have already accomplished itself, for the\nconcepts, being so many views taken after the fact, are retrospective\nand post mortem. Nevertheless we can draw conclusions from them and\nproject them into the future. We cannot learn from them how life made\nitself go, or how it will make itself go; but, on the supposition that\nits ways of making itself go are unchanging, we can calculate what\npositions of imagined arrest it will exhibit hereafter under given\nconditions. We can compute, for instance, at what point Achilles\nwill be, and where the tortoise will be, at the end of the twentieth\nminute. Achilles may then be at a point far ahead; but the full detail\nof how he will have managed practically to get there our logic never\ngives us--we have seen, indeed, that it finds that its results\ncontradict the facts of nature. The computations which the other\nsciences make differ in no respect from those of mathematics. The\nconcepts used are all of them dots through which, by interpolation or\nextrapolation, curves are drawn, while along the curves other dots are\nfound as consequences. The latest refinements of logic dispense\nwith the curves altogether, and deal solely with the dots and their\ncorrespondences each to each in various series. The authors of these\nrecent improvements tell us expressly that their aim is to abolish the\nlast vestiges of intuition, _videlicet_ of concrete reality, from the\nfield of reasoning, which then will operate literally on mental dots\nor bare abstract units of discourse, and on the ways in which they may\nbe strung in naked series.\nThis is all very esoteric, and my own understanding of it is most\nlikely misunderstanding. So I speak here only by way of brief reminder\nto those who know. For the rest of us it is enough to recognize this\nfact, that altho by means of concepts cut out from the sensible flux\nof the past, we can re-descend upon the future flux and, making\nanother cut, say what particular thing is likely to be found there;\nand that altho in this sense concepts give us knowledge, and may be\nsaid to have some theoretic value (especially when the particular\nthing foretold is one in which we take no present practical interest);\nyet in the deeper sense of giving _insight_ they have no theoretic\nvalue, for they quite fail to connect us with the inner life of the\nflux, or with the causes that govern its direction. Instead of being\ninterpreters of reality, concepts negate the inwardness of reality\naltogether. They make the whole notion of a causal influence between\nfinite things incomprehensible. No real activities and indeed no real\nconnexions of any kind can obtain if we follow the conceptual logic;\nfor to be distinguishable, according to what I call intellectualism,\nis to be incapable of connexion. The work begun by Zeno, and continued\nby Hume, Kant, Herbart, Hegel, and Bradley, does not stop till\nsensible reality lies entirely disintegrated at the feet of 'reason.'\nOf the 'absolute' reality which reason proposes to substitute for\nsensible reality I shall have more to say presently. Meanwhile you see\nwhat Professor Bergson means by insisting that the function of the\nintellect is practical rather than theoretical. Sensible reality is\ntoo concrete to be entirely manageable--look at the narrow range of it\nwhich is all that any animal, living in it exclusively as he does, is\nable to compass. To get from one point in it to another we have to\nplough or wade through the whole intolerable interval. No detail is\nspared us; it is as bad as the barbed-wire complications at Port\nArthur, and we grow old and die in the process. But with our faculty\nof abstracting and fixing concepts we are there in a second, almost as\nif we controlled a fourth dimension, skipping the intermediaries as\nby a divine winged power, and getting at the exact point we require\nwithout entanglement with any context. What we do in fact is to\n_harness up_ reality in our conceptual systems in order to drive it\nthe better. This process is practical because all the termini to which\nwe drive are _particular_ termini, even when they are facts of the\nmental order. But the sciences in which the conceptual method chiefly\ncelebrates its triumphs are those of space and matter, where the\ntransformations of external things are dealt with. To deal with moral\nfacts conceptually, we have first to transform them, substitute\nbrain-diagrams or physical metaphors, treat ideas as atoms, interests\nas mechanical forces, our conscious 'selves' as 'streams,' and the\nlike. Paradoxical effect! as Bergson well remarks, if our intellectual\nlife were not practical but destined to reveal the inner natures.\nOne would then suppose that it would find itself most at home in the\ndomain of its own intellectual realities. But it is precisely there\nthat it finds itself at the end of its tether. We know the inner\nmovements of our spirit only perceptually. We feel them live in us,\nbut can give no distinct account of their elements, nor definitely\npredict their future; while things that lie along the world of space,\nthings of the sort that we literally _handle_, are what our intellects\ncope with most successfully. Does not this confirm us in the view that\nthe original and still surviving function of our intellectual life\nis to guide us in the practical adaptation of our expectancies and\nactivities?\nOne can easily get into a verbal mess at this point, and my own\nexperience with pragmatism' makes me shrink from the dangers that lie\nin the word 'practical,' and far rather than stand out against you for\nthat word, I am quite willing to part company with Professor Bergson,\nand to ascribe a primarily theoretical function to our intellect,\nprovided you on your part then agree to discriminate 'theoretic' or\nscientific knowledge from the deeper 'speculative' knowledge aspired\nto by most philosophers, and concede that theoretic knowledge,\nwhich is knowledge _about_ things, as distinguished from living or\nsympathetic acquaintance with them, touches only the outer surface of\nreality. The surface which theoretic knowledge taken in this sense\ncovers may indeed be enormous in extent; it may dot the whole diameter\nof space and time with its conceptual creations; but it does not\npenetrate a millimeter into the solid dimension. That inner dimension\nof reality is occupied by the _activities_ that keep it going, but the\nintellect, speaking through Hume, Kant & Co., finds itself obliged to\ndeny, and persists in denying, that activities have any intelligible\nexistence. What exists for _thought_, we are told, is at most the\nresults that we illusorily ascribe to such activities, strung along\nthe surfaces of space and time by _regeln der verkn\u00fcpfung_, laws of\nnature which state only coexistences and successions.[1]\nThought deals thus solely with surfaces. It can name the thickness\nof reality, but it cannot fathom it, and its insufficiency here is\nessential and permanent, not temporary.\nThe only way in which to apprehend reality's thickness is either to\nexperience it directly by being a part of reality one's self, or to\nevoke it in imagination by sympathetically divining some one else's\ninner life. But what we thus immediately experience or concretely\ndivine is very limited in duration, whereas abstractly we are able to\nconceive eternities. Could we feel a million years concretely as we\nnow feel a passing minute, we should have very little employment for\nour conceptual faculty. We should know the whole period fully at every\nmoment of its passage, whereas we must now construct it laboriously by\nmeans of concepts which we project. Direct acquaintance and conceptual\nknowledge are thus complementary of each other; each remedies the\nother's defects. If what we care most about be the synoptic treatment\nof phenomena, the vision of the far and the gathering of the scattered\nlike, we must follow the conceptual method. But if, as metaphysicians,\nwe are more curious about the inner nature of reality or about what\nreally makes it go, we must turn our backs upon our winged concepts\naltogether, and bury ourselves in the thickness of those passing\nmoments over the surface of which they fly, and on particular points\nof which they occasionally rest and perch.\nProfessor Bergson thus inverts the traditional platonic doctrine\nabsolutely. Instead of intellectual knowledge being the profounder,\nhe calls it the more superficial. Instead of being the only adequate\nknowledge, it is grossly inadequate, and its only superiority is the\npractical one of enabling us to make short cuts through experience\nand thereby to save time. The one thing it cannot do is to reveal the\nnature of things--which last remark, if not clear already, will become\nclearer as I proceed. Dive back into the flux itself, then, Bergson\ntells us, if you wish to _know_ reality, that flux which Platonism, in\nits strange belief that only the immutable is excellent, has always\nspurned; turn your face toward sensation, that flesh-bound thing which\nrationalism has always loaded with abuse.--This, you see, is exactly\nthe opposite remedy from that of looking forward into the absolute,\nwhich our idealistic contemporaries prescribe. It violates our mental\nhabits, being a kind of passive and receptive listening quite contrary\nto that effort to react noisily and verbally on everything, which is\nour usual intellectual pose.\nWhat, then, are the peculiar features in the perceptual flux which the\nconceptual translation so fatally leaves out?\nThe essence of life is its continuously changing character; but our\nconcepts are all discontinuous and fixed, and the only mode of making\nthem coincide with life is by arbitrarily supposing positions of\narrest therein. With such arrests our concepts may be made congruent.\nBut these concepts are not _parts_ of reality, not real positions\ntaken by it, but _suppositions_ rather, notes taken by ourselves, and\nyou can no more dip up the substance of reality with them than you can\ndip up water with a net, however finely meshed.\nWhen we conceptualize, we cut out and fix, and exclude everything\nbut what we have fixed. A concept means a _that-and-no-other_.\nConceptually, time excludes space; motion and rest exclude each other;\napproach excludes contact; presence excludes absence; unity excludes\nplurality; independence excludes relativity; 'mine' excludes 'yours';\nthis connexion excludes that connexion--and so on indefinitely;\nwhereas in the real concrete sensible flux of life experiences\ncompenetrate each other so that it is not easy to know just what is\nexcluded and what not. Past and future, for example, conceptually\nseparated by the cut to which we give the name of present, and defined\nas being the opposite sides of that cut, are to some extent, however\nbrief, co-present with each other throughout experience. The literally\npresent moment is a purely verbal supposition, not a position; the\nonly present ever realized concretely being the 'passing moment' in\nwhich the dying rearward of time and its dawning future forever mix\ntheir lights. Say 'now' and it _was_ even while you say it.\nIt is just intellectualism's attempt to substitute static cuts\nfor units of experienced duration that makes real motion so\nunintelligible. The conception of the first half of the interval\nbetween Achilles and the tortoise excludes that of the last half, and\nthe mathematical necessity of traversing it separately before the last\nhalf is traversed stands permanently in the way of the last half ever\nbeing traversed. Meanwhile the living Achilles (who, for the purposes\nof this discussion, is only the abstract name of one phenomenon of\nimpetus, just as the tortoise is of another) asks no leave of logic.\nThe velocity of his acts is an indivisible nature in them like the\nexpansive tension in a spring compressed. We define it conceptually as\n[_s/t_], but the _s_ and _t_ are only artificial cuts made after the\nfact, and indeed most artificial when we treat them in both runners\nas the same tracts of 'objective' space and time, for the experienced\nspaces and times in which the tortoise inwardly lives are probably\nas different as his velocity from the same things in Achilles. The\nimpetus of Achilles is one concrete fact, and carries space, time, and\nconquest over the inferior creature's motion indivisibly in it. He\nperceives nothing, while running, of the mathematician's homogeneous\ntime and space, of the infinitely numerous succession of cuts in both,\nor of their order. End and beginning come for him in the one onrush,\nand all that he actually experiences is that, in the midst of a\ncertain intense effort of his own, the rival is in point of fact\noutstripped.\nWe are so inveterately wedded to the conceptual decomposition of life\nthat I know that this will seem to you like putting muddiest confusion\nin place of clearest thought, and relapsing into a molluscoid state\nof mind. Yet I ask you whether the absolute superiority of our higher\nthought is so very clear, if all that it can find is impossibility in\ntasks which sense-experience so easily performs.\nWhat makes you call real life confusion is that it presents, as\nif they were dissolved in one another, a lot of differents which\nconception breaks life's flow by keeping apart. But _are_ not\ndifferents actually dissolved in one another? Hasn't every bit of\nexperience its quality, its duration, its extension, its intensity,\nits urgency, its clearness, and many aspects besides, no one of which\ncan exist in the isolation in which our verbalized logic keeps it?\nThey exist only _durcheinander_. Reality always is, in M. Bergson's\nphrase, an endosmosis or conflux of the same with the different: they\ncompenetrate and telescope. For conceptual logic, the same is nothing\nbut the same, and all sames with a third thing are the same with each\nother. Not so in concrete experience. Two spots on our skin, each of\nwhich feels the same as a third spot when touched along with it, are\nfelt as different from each other. Two tones, neither distinguishable\nfrom a third tone, are perfectly distinct from each other. The whole\nprocess of life is due to life's violation of our logical axioms.\nTake its continuity as an example. Terms like A and C appear to be\nconnected by intermediaries, by B for example. Intellectualism calls\nthis absurd, for 'B-connected-with-A' is, 'as such,' a different term\nfrom 'B-connected-with-C.' But real life laughs at logic's veto.\nImagine a heavy log which takes two men to carry it. First A and B\ntake it. Then C takes hold and A drops off; then D takes hold and B\ndrops off, so that C and D now bear it; and so on. The log meanwhile\nnever drops, and keeps its sameness throughout the journey. Even so\nit is with all our experiences. Their changes are not complete\nannihilations followed by complete creations of something absolutely\nnovel. There is partial decay and partial growth, and all the while a\nnucleus of relative constancy from which what decays drops off, and\nwhich takes into itself whatever is grafted on, until at length\nsomething wholly different has taken its place. In such a process we\nare as sure, in spite of intellectualist logic with its 'as suches,'\nthat it _is_ the same nucleus which is able now to make connexion with\nwhat goes and again with what comes, as we are sure that the same\npoint can lie on diverse lines that intersect there. Without being one\nthroughout, such a universe is continuous. Its members interdigitate\nwith their next neighbors in manifold directions, and there are no\nclean cuts between them anywhere.\nThe great clash of intellectualist logic with sensible experience is\nwhere the experience is that of influence exerted. Intellectualism\ndenies (as we saw in lecture ii) that finite things can act on one\nanother, for all things, once translated into concepts, remain shut up\nto themselves. To act on anything means to get into it somehow; but\nthat would mean to get out of one's self and be one's other, which is\nself-contradictory, etc. Meanwhile each of us actually _is_ his own\nother to that extent, livingly knowing how to perform the trick which\nlogic tells us can't be done. My thoughts animate and actuate this\nvery body which you see and hear, and thereby influence your thoughts.\nThe dynamic current somehow does get from me to you, however numerous\nthe intermediary conductors may have to be. Distinctions may be\ninsulators in logic as much as they like, but in life distinct things\ncan and do commune together every moment.\nThe conflict of the two ways of knowing is best summed up in the\nintellectualist doctrine that 'the same cannot exist in many\nrelations.' This follows of course from the concepts of the two\nrelations being so distinct that 'what-is-in-the-one' means 'as such'\nsomething distinct from what 'what-is-in-the-other' means. It is like\nMill's ironical saying, that we should not think of Newton as both an\nEnglishman and a mathematician, because an Englishman as such is not\na mathematician and a mathematician as such is not an Englishman. But\nthe real Newton was somehow both things at once; and throughout the\nwhole finite universe each real thing proves to be many differents\nwithout undergoing the necessity of breaking into disconnected\neditions of itself.\nThese few indications will perhaps suffice to put you at the\nbergsonian point of view. The immediate experience of life solves the\nproblems which so baffle our conceptual intelligence: How can what is\nmanifold be one? how can things get out of themselves? how be their\nown others? how be both distinct and connected? how can they act on\none another? how be for others and yet for themselves? how be absent\nand present at once? The intellect asks these questions much as we\nmight ask how anything can both separate and unite things, or how\nsounds can grow more alike by continuing to grow more different. If\nyou already know space sensibly, you can answer the former question by\npointing to any interval in it, long or short; if you know the musical\nscale, you can answer the latter by sounding an octave; but then you\nmust first have the sensible knowledge of these realities. Similarly\nBergson answers the intellectualist conundrums by pointing back to our\nvarious finite sensational experiences and saying, 'Lo, even thus;\neven so are these other problems solved livingly.'\nWhen you have broken the reality into concepts you never can\nreconstruct it in its wholeness. Out of no amount of discreteness\ncan you manufacture the concrete. But place yourself at a bound, or\n_d'embl\u00e9e_, as M. Bergson says, inside of the living, moving, active\nthickness of the real, and all the abstractions and distinctions\nare given into your hand: you can now make the intellectualist\nsubstitutions to your heart's content. Install yourself in phenomenal\nmovement, for example, and velocity, succession, dates, positions, and\ninnumerable other things are given you in the bargain. But with only\nan abstract succession of dates and positions you can never patch up\nmovement itself. It slips through their intervals and is lost.\nSo it is with every concrete thing, however complicated. Our\nintellectual handling of it is a retrospective patchwork, a\npost-mortem dissection, and can follow any order we find most\nexpedient. We can make the thing seem self-contradictory whenever\nwe wish to. But place yourself at the point of view of the thing's\ninterior _doing_, and all these back-looking and conflicting\nconceptions lie harmoniously in your hand. Get at the expanding centre\nof a human character, the _\u00e9lan vital_ of a man, as Bergson calls it,\nby living sympathy, and at a stroke you see how it makes those who see\nit from without interpret it in such diverse ways. It is something\nthat breaks into both honesty and dishonesty, courage and cowardice,\nstupidity and insight, at the touch of varying circumstances, and you\nfeel exactly why and how it does this, and never seek to identify\nit stably with any of these single abstractions. Only your\nintellectualist does that,--and you now also feel why _he_ must do it\nto the end.\nPlace yourself similarly at the centre of a man's philosophic vision\nand you understand at once all the different things it makes him write\nor say. But keep outside, use your post-mortem method, try to build\nthe philosophy up out of the single phrases, taking first one and then\nanother and seeking to make them fit, and of course you fail. You\ncrawl over the thing like a myopic ant over a building, tumbling\ninto every microscopic crack or fissure, finding nothing but\ninconsistencies, and never suspecting that a centre exists. I hope\nthat some of the philosophers in this audience may occasionally have\nhad something different from this intellectualist type of criticism\napplied to their own works!\nWhat really _exists_ is not things made but things in the making. Once\nmade, they are dead, and an infinite number of alternative conceptual\ndecompositions can be used in defining them. But put yourself _in the\nmaking_ by a stroke of intuitive sympathy with the thing and, the\nwhole range of possible decompositions coming at once into your\npossession, you are no longer troubled with the question which of\nthem is the more absolutely true. Reality _falls_ in passing into\nconceptual analysis; it _mounts_ in living its own undivided life--it\nbuds and bourgeons, changes and creates. Once adopt the movement of\nthis life in any given instance and you know what Bergson calls the\n_devenir r\u00e9el_ by which the thing evolves and grows. Philosophy should\nseek this kind of living understanding of the movement of reality,\nnot follow science in vainly patching together fragments of its dead\nresults.\nThus much of M. Bergson's philosophy is sufficient for my purpose in\nthese lectures, so here I will stop, leaving unnoticed all its other\nconstituent features, original and interesting tho they be. You may\nsay, and doubtless some of you now are saying inwardly, that his\nremanding us to sensation in this wise is only a regress, a return to\nthat ultra-crude empiricism which your own idealists since Green\nhave buried ten times over. I confess that it is indeed a return to\nempiricism, but I think that the return in such accomplished shape\nonly proves the latter's immortal truth. What won't stay buried must\nhave some genuine life. _Am anfang war die tat_; fact is a _first_; to\nwhich all our conceptual handling comes as an inadequate second,\nnever its full equivalent. When I read recent transcendentalist\nliterature--I must partly except my colleague Royce!--I get nothing\nbut a sort of marking of time, champing of jaws, pawing of the ground,\nand resettling into the same attitude, like a weary horse in a stall\nwith an empty manger. It is but turning over the same few threadbare\ncategories, bringing the same objections, and urging the same answers\nand solutions, with never a new fact or a new horizon coming into\nsight. But open Bergson, and new horizons loom on every page you read.\nIt is like the breath of the morning and the song of birds. It tells\nof reality itself, instead of merely reiterating what dusty-minded\nprofessors have written about what other previous professors have\nthought. Nothing in Bergson is shop-worn or at second hand.\nThat he gives us no closed-in system will of course be fatal to him in\nintellectualist eyes. He only evokes and invites; but he first annuls\nthe intellectualist veto, so that we now join step with reality with\na philosophical conscience never quite set free before. As a french\ndisciple of his well expresses it: 'Bergson claims of us first of all\na certain inner catastrophe, and not every one is capable of such a\nlogical revolution. But those who have once found themselves flexible\nenough for the execution of such a psychological change of front,\ndiscover somehow that they can never return again to their ancient\nattitude of mind. They are now Bergsonians ... and possess the\nprincipal thoughts of the master all at once. They have understood in\nthe fashion in which one loves, they have caught the whole melody and\ncan thereafter admire at their leisure the originality, the fecundity,\nand the imaginative genius with which its author develops, transposes,\nand varies in a thousand ways by the orchestration of his style and\ndialectic, the original theme.'[2]\nThis, scant as it is, is all I have to say about Bergson on this\noccasion--I hope it may send some of you to his original text. I must\nnow turn back to the point where I found it advisable to appeal to his\nideas. You remember my own intellectualist difficulties in the last\nlecture, about how a lot of separate consciousnesses can at the same\ntime be one collective thing. How, I asked, can one and the same\nidentical content of experience, of which on idealist principles the\n_esse_ is to be felt, be felt so diversely if itself be the only\nfeeler? The usual way of escape by 'quatenus' or 'as such' won't\nhelp us here if we are radical intellectualists, I said, for\nappearance-together is as such _not_ appearance-apart, the world _qu\u00e2_\nmany is not the world _qu\u00e2_ one, as absolutism claims. If we hold to\nHume's maxim, which later intellectualism uses so well, that whatever\nthings are distinguished are as separate as if there were no manner of\nconnexion between them, there seemed no way out of the difficulty save\nby stepping outside of experience altogether and invoking different\nspiritual agents, selves or souls, to realize the diversity required.\nBut this rescue by 'scholastic entities' I was unwilling to accept any\nmore than pantheistic idealists accept it.\nYet, to quote Fechner's phrase again, 'nichts wirkliches kann\nunm\u00f6glich sein,' the actual cannot be impossible, and what _is_ actual\nat every moment of our lives is the sort of thing which I now\nproceed to remind you of. You can hear the vibration of an electric\ncontact-maker, smell the ozone, see the sparks, and feel the thrill,\nco-consciously as it were or in one field of experience. But you can\nalso isolate any one of these sensations by shutting out the rest. If\nyou close your eyes, hold your nose, and remove your hand, you can get\nthe sensation of sound alone, but it seems still the same sensation\nthat it was; and if you restore the action of the other organs, the\nsound coalesces with the feeling, the sight, and the smell sensations\nagain. Now the natural way of talking of all this[3] is to say that\ncertain sensations are experienced, now singly, and now together\nwith other sensations, in a common conscious field. Fluctuations of\nattention give analogous results. We let a sensation in or keep it out\nby changing our attention; and similarly we let an item of memory in\nor drop it out. [Please don't raise the question here of how these\nchanges _come to pass_. The immediate condition is probably cerebral\nin every instance, but it would be irrelevant now to consider it, for\nnow we are thinking only of results, and I repeat that the natural way\nof thinking of them is that which intellectualist criticism finds so\nabsurd.]\nThe absurdity charged is that the self-same should function so\ndifferently, now with and now without something else. But this it\nsensibly seems to do. This very desk which I strike with my hand\nstrikes in turn your eyes. It functions at once as a physical object\nin the outer world and as a mental object in our sundry mental worlds.\nThe very body of mine that _my_ thought actuates is the body whose\ngestures are _your_ visual object and to which you give my name. The\nvery log which John helped to carry is the log now borne by James. The\nvery girl you love is simultaneously entangled elsewhere. The very\nplace behind me is in front of you. Look where you will, you gather\nonly examples of the same amid the different, and of different\nrelations existing as it were in solution in the same thing. _Qu\u00e2_\nthis an experience is not the same as it is _qu\u00e2_ that, truly enough;\nbut the _qu\u00e2s_ are conceptual shots of ours at its post-mortem\nremains, and in its sensational immediacy everything is all at once\nwhatever different things it is at once at all. It is before C and\nafter A, far from you and near to me, without this associate and with\nthat one, active and passive, physical and mental, a whole of\nparts and part of a higher whole, all simultaneously and without\ninterference or need of doubling-up its being, so long as we keep to\nwhat I call the 'immediate' point of view, the point of view in which\nwe follow our sensational life's continuity, and to which all living\nlanguage conforms. It is only when you try--to continue using the\nhegelian vocabulary--to 'mediate' the immediate, or to substitute\nconcepts for sensational life, that intellectualism celebrates\nits triumph and the immanent-self-contradictoriness of all this\nsmooth-running finite experience gets proved.\nOf the oddity of inventing as a remedy for the inconveniences\nresulting from this situation a supernumerary conceptual object\ncalled an absolute, into which you pack the self-same contradictions\nunreduced, I will say something in the next lecture. The absolute is\nsaid to perform its feats by taking up its other into itself. But\nthat is exactly what is done when every individual morsel of the\nsensational stream takes up the adjacent morsels by coalescing with\nthem. This is just what we mean by the stream's sensible continuity.\nNo element _there_ cuts itself off from any other element, as concepts\ncut themselves from concepts. No part _there_ is so small as not to be\na place of conflux. No part there is not really _next_ its neighbors;\nwhich means that there is literally nothing between; which means\nagain that no part goes exactly so far and no farther; that no part\nabsolutely excludes another, but that they compenetrate and are\ncohesive; that if you tear out one, its roots bring out more with\nthem; that whatever is real is telescoped and diffused into other\nreals; that, in short, every minutest thing is already its hegelian\n'own other,' in the fullest sense of the term.\nOf course this _sounds_ self-contradictory, but as the immediate facts\ndon't sound at all, but simply _are_, until we conceptualize and name\nthem vocally, the contradiction results only from the conceptual\nor discursive form being substituted for the real form. But if, as\nBergson shows, that form is superimposed for practical ends only, in\norder to let us jump about over life instead of wading through it;\nand if it cannot even pretend to reveal anything of what life's inner\nnature is or ought to be; why then we can turn a deaf ear to its\naccusations. The resolve to turn the deaf ear is the inner crisis or\n'catastrophe' of which M. Bergson's disciple whom I lately quoted\nspoke. We are so subject to the philosophic tradition which treats\n_logos_ or discursive thought generally as the sole avenue to truth,\nthat to fall back on raw unverbalized life as more of a revealer, and\nto think of concepts as the merely practical things which Bergson\ncalls them, comes very hard. It is putting off our proud maturity of\nmind and becoming again as foolish little children in the eyes of\nreason. But difficult as such a revolution is, there is no other way,\nI believe, to the possession of reality, and I permit myself to hope\nthat some of you may share my opinion after you have heard my next\nlecture.\nLECTURE VII\nTHE CONTINUITY OF EXPERIENCE\nI fear that few of you will have been able to obey Bergson's call upon\nyou to look towards the sensational life for the fuller knowledge of\nreality, or to sympathize with his attempt to limit the divine right\nof concepts to rule our mind absolutely. It is too much like looking\ndownward and not up. Philosophy, you will say, doesn't lie flat on its\nbelly in the middle of experience, in the very thick of its sand and\ngravel, as this Bergsonism does, never getting a peep at anything from\nabove. Philosophy is essentially the vision of things from above.\nIt doesn't simply feel the detail of things, it comprehends their\nintelligible plan, sees their forms and principles, their categories\nand rules, their order and necessity. It takes the superior point of\nview of the architect. Is it conceivable that it should ever forsake\nthat point of view and abandon itself to a slovenly life of immediate\nfeeling? To say nothing of your traditional Oxford devotion to\nAristotle and Plato, the leaven of T.H. Green probably works still\ntoo strongly here for his anti-sensationalism to be outgrown quickly.\nGreen more than any one realized that knowledge _about_ things was\nknowledge of their relations; but nothing could persuade him that our\nsensational life could contain any relational element. He followed\nthe strict intellectualist method with sensations. What they were not\nexpressly defined as including, they must exclude. Sensations are not\ndefined as relations, so in the end Green thought that they could\nget related together only by the action on them from above of a\n'self-distinguishing' absolute and eternal mind, present to that which\nis related, but not related itself. 'A relation,' he said, 'is not\ncontingent with the contingency of feeling. It is permanent with\nthe permanence of the combining and comparing thought which alone\nconstitutes it.'[1] In other words, relations are purely conceptual\nobjects, and the sensational life as such cannot relate itself\ntogether. Sensation in itself, Green wrote, is fleeting, momentary,\nunnameable (because, while we name it, it has become another), and for\nthe same reason unknowable, the very negation of knowability. Were\nthere no permanent objects of conception for our sensations to be\n'referred to,' there would be no significant names, but only noises,\nand a consistent sensationalism must be speechless.[2] Green's\nintellectualism was so earnest that it produced a natural and an\ninevitable effect. But the atomistic and unrelated sensations which he\nhad in mind were purely fictitious products of his rationalist fancy.\nThe psychology of our own day disavows them utterly,[3] and Green's\nlaborious belaboring of poor old Locke for not having first seen that\nhis ideas of sensation were just that impracticable sort of thing, and\nthen fled to transcendental idealism as a remedy,--his belaboring of\npoor old Locke for this, I say, is pathetic. Every examiner of the\nsensible life _in concreto_ must see that relations of every sort, of\ntime, space, difference, likeness, change, rate, cause, or what not,\nare just as integral members of the sensational flux as terms are, and\nthat conjunctive relations are just as true members of the flux as\ndisjunctive relations are.[4] This is what in some recent writings of\nmine I have called the 'radically empiricist' doctrine (in distinction\nfrom the doctrine of mental atoms which the name empiricism so\noften suggests). Intellectualistic critics of sensation insist that\nsensations are _disjoined_ only. Radical empiricism insists\nthat conjunctions between them are just as immediately given as\ndisjunctions are, and that relations, whether disjunctive or\nconjunctive, are in their original sensible givenness just as fleeting\nand momentary (in Green's words), and just as 'particular,' as terms\nare. Later, both terms and relations get universalized by being\nconceptualized and named.[5] But all the thickness, concreteness, and\nindividuality of experience exists in the immediate and relatively\nunnamed stages of it, to the richness of which, and to the standing\ninadequacy of our conceptions to match it, Professor Bergson so\nemphatically calls our attention. And now I am happy to say that we\ncan begin to gather together some of the separate threads of our\nargument, and see a little better the general kind of conclusion\ntoward which we are tending. Pray go back with me to the lecture\nbefore the last, and recall what I said about the difficulty of seeing\nhow states of consciousness can compound themselves. The difficulty\nseemed to be the same, you remember, whether we took it in psychology\nas the composition of finite states of mind out of simpler finite\nstates, or in metaphysics as the composition of the absolute mind out\nof finite minds in general. It is the general conceptualist difficulty\nof any one thing being the same with many things, either at once or\nin succession, for the abstract concepts of oneness and manyness must\nneeds exclude each other. In the particular instance that we have\ndwelt on so long, the one thing is the all-form of experience, the\nmany things are the each-forms of experience in you and me. To call\nthem the same we must treat them as if each were simultaneously\nits own other, a feat on conceptualist principles impossible of\nperformance.\nOn the principle of going behind the conceptual function altogether,\nhowever, and looking to the more primitive flux of the sensational\nlife for reality's true shape, a way is open to us, as I tried in my\nlast lecture to show. Not only the absolute is its own other, but the\nsimplest bits of immediate experience are their own others, if that\nhegelian phrase be once for all allowed. The concrete pulses of\nexperience appear pent in by no such definite limits as our conceptual\nsubstitutes for them are confined by. They run into one another\ncontinuously and seem to interpenetrate. What in them is relation and\nwhat is matter related is hard to discern. You feel no one of them as\ninwardly simple, and no two as wholly without confluence where they\ntouch. There is no datum so small as not to show this mystery, if\nmystery it be. The tiniest feeling that we can possibly have comes\nwith an earlier and a later part and with a sense of their continuous\nprocession. Mr. Shadworth Hodgson showed long ago that there is\nliterally no such object as the present moment except as an unreal\npostulate of abstract thought.[6] The 'passing' moment is, as I\nalready have reminded you, the minimal fact, with the 'apparition of\ndifference' inside of it as well as outside. If we do not feel both\npast and present in one field of feeling, we feel them not at all. We\nhave the same many-in-one in the matter that fills the passing time.\nThe rush of our thought forward through its fringes is the everlasting\npeculiarity of its life. We realize this life as something always off\nits balance, something in transition, something that shoots out of a\ndarkness through a dawn into a brightness that we feel to be the dawn\nfulfilled. In the very midst of the continuity our experience comes as\nan alteration. 'Yes,' we say at the full brightness, '_this_ is what I\njust meant.' 'No,' we feel at the dawning, 'this is not yet the full\nmeaning, there is more to come.' In every crescendo of sensation, in\nevery effort to recall, in every progress towards the satisfaction\nof desire, this succession of an emptiness and fulness that have\nreference to each other and are one flesh is the essence of the\nphenomenon. In every hindrance of desire the sense of an ideal\npresence which is absent in fact, of an absent, in a word, which the\nonly function of the present is to _mean_, is even more notoriously\nthere. And in the movement of pure thought we have the same\nphenomenon. When I say _Socrates is mortal_, the moment _Socrates_ is\nincomplete; it falls forward through the _is_ which is pure movement,\ninto the _mortal_ which is indeed bare mortal on the tongue, but\nfor the mind is _that mortal_, the _mortal Socrates_, at last\nsatisfactorily disposed of and told off.[7]\nHere, then, inside of the minimal pulses of experience, is realized\nthat very inner complexity which the transcendentalists say only the\nabsolute can genuinely possess. The gist of the matter is always the\nsame--something ever goes indissolubly with something else. You cannot\nseparate the same from its other, except by abandoning the real\naltogether and taking to the conceptual system. What is immediately\ngiven in the single and particular instance is always something pooled\nand mutual, something with no dark spot, no point of ignorance. No one\nelementary bit of reality is eclipsed from the next bit's point of\nview, if only we take reality sensibly and in small enough pulses--and\nby us it has to be taken pulse-wise, for our span of consciousness is\ntoo short to grasp the larger collectivity of things except nominally\nand abstractly. No more of reality collected together at once is\nextant anywhere, perhaps, than in my experience of reading this page,\nor in yours of listening; yet within those bits of experience as\nthey come to pass we get a fulness of content that no conceptual\ndescription can equal. Sensational experiences _are_ their 'own\nothers,' then, both internally and externally. Inwardly they are one\nwith their parts, and outwardly they pass continuously into their next\nneighbors, so that events separated by years of time in a man's life\nhang together unbrokenly by the intermediary events. Their _names_,\nto be sure, cut them into separate conceptual entities, but no cuts\nexisted in the continuum in which they originally came.\nIf, with all this in our mind, we turn to our own particular\npredicament, we see that our old objection to the self-compounding of\nstates of consciousness, our accusation that it was impossible for\npurely logical reasons, is unfounded in principle. Every smallest\nstate of consciousness, concretely taken, overflows its own\ndefinition. Only concepts are self-identical; only 'reason' deals with\nclosed equations; nature is but a name for excess; every point in\nher opens out and runs into the more; and the only question, with\nreference to any point we may be considering, is how far into the\nrest of nature we may have to go in order to get entirely beyond its\noverflow. In the pulse of inner life immediately present now in each\nof us is a little past, a little future, a little awareness of our own\nbody, of each other's persons, of these sublimities we are trying to\ntalk about, of the earth's geography and the direction of history,\nof truth and error, of good and bad, and of who knows how much more?\nFeeling, however dimly and subconsciously, all these things, your\npulse of inner life is continuous with them, belongs to them and they\nto it. You can't identify it with either one of them rather than with\nthe others, for if you let it develop into no matter which of those\ndirections, what it develops into will look back on it and say, 'That\nwas the original germ of me.'\nIn _principle_, then, the real units of our immediately-felt life are\nunlike the units that intellectualist logic holds to and makes its\ncalculations with. They are not separate from their own others, and\nyou have to take them at widely separated dates to find any two of\nthem that seem unblent. Then indeed they do appear separate even as\ntheir concepts are separate; a chasm yawns between them; but the chasm\nitself is but an intellectualist fiction, got by abstracting from the\ncontinuous sheet of experiences with which the intermediary time was\nfilled. It is like the log carried first by William and Henry, then\nby William, Henry, and John, then by Henry and John, then by John and\nPeter, and so on. All real units of experience _overlap_. Let a row of\nequidistant dots on a sheet of paper symbolize the concepts by which\nwe intellectualize the world. Let a ruler long enough to cover at\nleast three dots stand for our sensible experience. Then the conceived\nchanges of the sensible experience can be symbolized by sliding the\nruler along the line of dots. One concept after another will apply to\nit, one after another drop away, but it will always cover at least two\nof them, and no dots less than three will ever adequately cover _it_.\nYou falsify it if you treat it conceptually, or by the law of dots.\nWhat is true here of successive states must also be true of\nsimultaneous characters. They also overlap each other with their\nbeing. My present field of consciousness is a centre surrounded by a\nfringe that shades insensibly into a subconscious more. I use three\nseparate terms here to describe, this fact; but I might as well use\nthree hundred, for the fact is all shades and no boundaries. Which\npart of it properly is in my consciousness, which out? If I name what\nis out, it already has come in. The centre works in one way while the\nmargins work in another, and presently overpower the centre and are\ncentral themselves. What we conceptually identify ourselves with and\nsay we are thinking of at any time is the centre; but our _full_ self\nis the whole field, with all those indefinitely radiating subconscious\npossibilities of increase that we can only feel without conceiving,\nand can hardly begin to analyze. The collective and the distributive\nways of being coexist here, for each part functions distinctly, makes\nconnexion with its own peculiar region in the still wider rest of\nexperience and tends to draw us into that line, and yet the whole is\nsomehow felt as one pulse of our life,--not conceived so, but felt so.\nIn principle, then, as I said, intellectualism's edge is broken; it\ncan only approximate to reality, and its logic is inapplicable to our\ninner life, which spurns its vetoes and mocks at its impossibilities.\nEvery bit of us at every moment is part and parcel of a wider self, it\nquivers along various radii like the wind-rose on a compass, and the\nactual in it is continuously one with possibles not yet in our present\nsight.[8] And just as we are co-conscious with our own momentary\nmargin, may not we ourselves form the margin of some more really\ncentral self in things which is co-conscious with the whole of us? May\nnot you and I be confluent in a higher consciousness, and confluently\nactive there, tho we now know it not?\nI am tiring myself and you, I know, by vainly seeking to describe\nby concepts and words what I say at the same time exceeds either\nconceptualization or verbalization. As long as one continues\n_talking_, intellectualism remains in undisturbed possession of the\nfield. The return to life can't come about by talking. It is an _act_;\nto make you return to life, I must set an example for your imitation,\nI must deafen you to talk, or to the importance of talk, by showing\nyou, as Bergson does, that the concepts we talk with are made for\npurposes of _practice_ and not for purposes of insight. Or I must\n_point_, point to the mere _that_ of life, and you by inner sympathy\nmust fill out the _what_ for yourselves. The minds of some of you,\nI know, will absolutely refuse to do so, refuse to think in\nnon-conceptualized terms. I myself absolutely refused to do so\nfor years together, even after I knew that the denial of\nmanyness-in-oneness by intellectualism must be false, for the same\nreality does perform the most various functions at once. But I hoped\never for a revised intellectualist way round the difficulty, and it\nwas only after reading Bergson that I saw that to continue using the\nintellectualist method was itself the fault. I saw that philosophy had\nbeen on a false scent ever since the days of Socrates and Plato, that\nan _intellectual_ answer to the intellectualist's difficulties will\nnever come, and that the real way out of them, far from consisting in\nthe discovery of such an answer, consists in simply closing one's ears\nto the question. When conceptualism summons life to justify itself\nin conceptual terms, it is like a challenge addressed in a foreign\nlanguage to some one who is absorbed in his own business; it is\nirrelevant to him altogether--he may let it lie unnoticed. I went thus\nthrough the 'inner catastrophe' of which I spoke in the last lecture;\nI had literally come to the end of my conceptual stock-in-trade, I was\nbankrupt intellectualistically, and had to change my base. No words\nof mine will probably convert you, for words can be the names only of\nconcepts. But if any of you try sincerely and pertinaciously on your\nown separate accounts to intellectualize reality, you may be similarly\ndriven to a change of front. I say no more: I must leave life to teach\nthe lesson.\nWe have now reached a point of view from which the self-compounding of\nmind in its smaller and more accessible portions seems a certain\nfact, and in which the speculative assumption of a similar but wider\ncompounding in remoter regions must be reckoned with as a legitimate\nhypothesis. The absolute is not the impossible being I once thought\nit. Mental facts do function both singly and together, at once, and we\nfinite minds may simultaneously be co-conscious with one another in a\nsuperhuman intelligence. It is only the extravagant claims of coercive\nnecessity on the absolute's part that have to be denied by _a priori_\nlogic. As an hypothesis trying to make itself probable on analogical\nand inductive grounds, the absolute is entitled to a patient hearing.\nWhich is as much as to say that our serious business from now onward\nlies with Fechner and his method, rather than with Hegel, Royce, or\nBradley. Fechner treats the superhuman consciousness he so fervently\nbelieves in as an hypothesis only, which he then recommends by all the\nresources of induction and persuasion.\nIt is true that Fechner himself is an absolutist in his books, not\nactively but passively, if I may say so. He talks not only of the\nearth-soul and of the star-souls, but of an integrated soul of all\nthings in the cosmos without exception, and this he calls God just\nas others call it the absolute. Nevertheless he _thinks_ only of\nthe subordinate superhuman souls, and content with having made his\nobeisance once for all to the august total soul of the cosmos, he\nleaves it in its lonely sublimity with no attempt to define its\nnature. Like the absolute, it is 'out of range,' and not an object for\ndistincter vision. Psychologically, it seems to me that Fechner's\nGod is a lazy postulate of his, rather than a part of his system\npositively thought out. As we envelop our sight and hearing, so the\nearth-soul envelops us, and the star-soul the earth-soul, until--what?\nEnvelopment can't go on forever; it must have an _abschluss_, a total\nenvelope must terminate the series, so God is the name that Fechner\ngives to this last all-enveloper. But if nothing escapes this\nall-enveloper, he is responsible for everything, including evil, and\nall the paradoxes and difficulties which I found in the absolute\nat the end of our third lecture recur undiminished. Fechner tries\nsincerely to grapple with the problem of evil, but he always solves it\nin the leibnitzian fashion by making his God non-absolute, placing\nhim under conditions of 'metaphysical necessity' which even his\nomnipotence cannot violate. His will has to struggle with conditions\nnot imposed on that will by itself. He tolerates provisionally what he\nhas not created, and then with endless patience tries to overcome it\nand live it down. He has, in short, a history. Whenever Fechner tries\nto represent him clearly, his God becomes the ordinary God of theism,\nand ceases to be the absolutely totalized all-enveloper.[9] In this\nshape, he represents the ideal element in things solely, and is our\nchampion and our helper and we his helpers, against the bad parts of\nthe universe.\nFechner was in fact too little of a metaphysician to care for perfect\nformal consistency in these abstract regions. He believed in God in\nthe pluralistic manner, but partly from convention and partly from\nwhat I should call intellectual laziness, if laziness of any kind\ncould be imputed to a Fechner, he let the usual monistic talk about\nhim pass unchallenged. I propose to you that we should discuss the\nquestion of God without entangling ourselves in advance in the\nmonistic assumption. Is it probable that there is any superhuman\nconsciousness at all, in the first place? When that is settled, the\nfurther question whether its form be monistic or pluralistic is in\norder.\nBefore advancing to either question, however, and I shall have to deal\nwith both but very briefly after what has been said already, let me\nfinish our retrospective survey by one more remark about the curious\nlogical situation of the absolutists. For what have they invoked the\nabsolute except as a being the peculiar inner form of which shall\nenable it to overcome the contradictions with which intellectualism\nhas found the finite many as such to be infected? The many-in-one\ncharacter that, as we have seen, every smallest tract of finite\nexperience offers, is considered by intellectualism to be fatal to the\nreality of finite experience. What can be distinguished, it tells us,\nis separate; and what is separate is unrelated, for a relation, being\na 'between,' would bring only a twofold separation. Hegel, Royce,\nBradley, and the Oxford absolutists in general seem to agree about\nthis logical absurdity of manyness-in-oneness in the only places where\nit is empirically found. But see the curious tactics! Is the absurdity\n_reduced_ in the absolute being whom they call in to relieve it? Quite\notherwise, for that being shows it on an infinitely greater scale, and\nflaunts it in its very definition. The fact of its not being related\nto any outward environment, the fact that all relations are inside of\nitself, doesn't save it, for Mr. Bradley's great argument against the\nfinite is that _in_ any given bit of it (a bit of sugar, for instance)\nthe presence of a plurality of characters (whiteness and sweetness,\nfor example) is self-contradictory; so that in the final end all that\nthe absolute's name appears to stand for is the persistent claim of\noutraged human nature that reality _shall_ not be called\nabsurd. _Somewhere_ there must be an aspect of it guiltless of\nself-contradiction. All we can see of the absolute, meanwhile, is\nguilty in the same way in which the finite is. Intellectualism sees\nwhat it calls the guilt, when comminuted in the finite object; but\nis too near-sighted to see it in the more enormous object. Yet the\nabsolute's constitution, if imagined at all, has to be imagined after\nthe analogy of some bit of finite experience. Take any _real_ bit,\nsuppress its environment and then magnify it to monstrosity, and you\nget identically the type of structure of the absolute. It is obvious\nthat all your difficulties here remain and go with you. If the\nrelative experience was inwardly absurd, the absolute experience is\ninfinitely more so. Intellectualism, in short, strains off the gnat,\nbut swallows the whole camel. But this polemic against the absolute\nis as odious to me as it is to you, so I will say no more about that\nbeing. It is only one of those wills of the wisp, those lights that\ndo mislead the morn, that have so often impeded the clear progress of\nphilosophy, so I will turn to the more general positive question of\nwhether superhuman unities of consciousness should be considered as\nmore probable or more improbable.\nIn a former lecture I went over some of the fechnerian reasons for\ntheir plausibility, or reasons that at least replied to our more\nobvious grounds of doubt concerning them. The numerous facts of\ndivided or split human personality which the genius of certain medical\nmen, as Janet, Freud, Prince, Sidis, and others, have unearthed were\nunknown in Fechner's time, and neither the phenomena of automatic\nwriting and speech, nor of mediumship and 'possession' generally, had\nbeen recognized or studied as we now study them, so Fechner's stock of\nanalogies is scant compared with our present one. He did the best with\nwhat he had, however. For my own part I find in some of these abnormal\nor supernormal facts the strongest suggestions in favor of a superior\nco-consciousness being possible. I doubt whether we shall ever\nunderstand some of them without using the very letter of Fechner's\nconception of a great reservoir in which the memories of earth's\ninhabitants are pooled and preserved, and from which, when the\nthreshold lowers or the valve opens, information ordinarily shut out\nleaks into the mind of exceptional individuals among us. But those\nregions of inquiry are perhaps too spook-haunted to interest an\nacademic audience, and the only evidence I feel it now decorous to\nbring to the support of Fechner is drawn from ordinary religious\nexperience. I think it may be asserted that there _are_ religious\nexperiences of a specific nature, not deducible by analogy or\npsychological reasoning from our other sorts of experience. I think\nthat they point with reasonable probability to the continuity of\nour consciousness with a wider spiritual environment from which\nthe ordinary prudential man (who is the only man that scientific\npsychology, so called, takes cognizance of) is shut off. I shall begin\nmy final lecture by referring to them again briefly.\nLECTURE VIII\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt the close of my last lecture I referred to the existence of\nreligious experiences of a specific nature. I must now explain just\nwhat I mean by such a claim. Briefly, the facts I have in mind may\nall be described as experiences of an unexpected life succeeding upon\ndeath. By this I don't mean immortality, or the death of the body. I\nmean the deathlike termination of certain mental processes within the\nindividual's experience, processes that run to failure, and in some\nindividuals, at least, eventuate in despair. Just as romantic love\nseems a comparatively recent literary invention, so these experiences\nof a life that supervenes upon despair seem to have played no great\npart in official theology till Luther's time; and possibly the best\nway to indicate their character will be to point to a certain contrast\nbetween the inner life of ourselves and of the ancient Greeks and\nRomans.\nMr. Chesterton, I think, says somewhere, that the Greeks and Romans,\nin all that concerned their moral life, were an extraordinarily solemn\nset of folks. The Athenians thought that the very gods must admire the\nrectitude of Phocion and Aristides; and those gentlemen themselves\nwere apparently of much the same opinion. Cato's veracity was so\nimpeccable that the extremest incredulity a Roman could express of\nanything was to say, 'I would not believe it even if Cato had told\nme.' Good was good, and bad was bad, for these people. Hypocrisy,\nwhich church-Christianity brought in, hardly existed; the naturalistic\nsystem held firm; its values showed no hollowness and brooked no\nirony. The individual, if virtuous enough, could meet all possible\nrequirements. The pagan pride had never crumbled. Luther was the first\nmoralist who broke with any effectiveness through the crust of all\nthis naturalistic self-sufficiency, thinking (and possibly he was\nright) that Saint Paul had done it already. Religious experience of\nthe lutheran type brings all our naturalistic standards to bankruptcy.\nYou are strong only by being weak, it shows. You cannot live on pride\nor self-sufficingness. There is a light in which all the naturally\nfounded and currently accepted distinctions, excellences, and\nsafeguards of our characters appear as utter childishness. Sincerely\nto give up one's conceit or hope of being good in one's own right is\nthe only door to the universe's deeper reaches.\nThese deeper reaches are familiar to evangelical Christianity and\nto what is nowadays becoming known as 'mind-cure' religion or 'new\nthought.' The phenomenon is that of new ranges of life succeeding on\nour most despairing moments. There are resources in us that naturalism\nwith its literal and legal virtues never recks of, possibilities that\ntake our breath away, of another kind of happiness and power, based on\ngiving up our own will and letting something higher work for us, and\nthese seem to show a world wider than either physics or philistine\nethics can imagine. Here is a world in which all is well, in _spite_\nof certain forms of death, indeed _because_ of certain forms of\ndeath--death of hope, death of strength, death of responsibility,\nof fear and worry, competency and desert, death of everything that\npaganism, naturalism, and legalism pin their faith on and tie their\ntrust to.\nReason, operating on our other experiences, even our psychological\nexperiences, would never have inferred these specifically religious\nexperiences in advance of their actual coming. She could not suspect\ntheir existence, for they are discontinuous with the 'natural'\nexperiences they succeed upon and invert their values. But as they\nactually come and are given, creation widens to the view of their\nrecipients. They suggest that our natural experience, our strictly\nmoralistic and prudential experience, may be only a fragment of real\nhuman experience. They soften nature's outlines and open out the\nstrangest possibilities and perspectives.\nThis is why it seems to me that the logical understanding, working in\nabstraction from such specifically religious experiences, will always\nomit something, and fail to reach completely adequate conclusions.\nDeath and failure, it will always say, _are_ death and failure\nsimply, and can nevermore be one with life; so religious experience,\npeculiarly so called, needs, in my opinion, to be carefully considered\nand interpreted by every one who aspires to reason out a more complete\nphilosophy.\nThe sort of belief that religious experience of this type naturally\nengenders in those who have it is fully in accord with Fechner's\ntheories. To quote words which I have used elsewhere, the believer\nfinds that the tenderer parts of his personal life are continuous\nwith a _more_ of the same quality which is operative in the universe\noutside of him and which he can keep in working touch with, and in a\nfashion get on board of and save himself, when all his lower being has\ngone to pieces in the wreck. In a word, the believer is continuous,\nto his own consciousness, at any rate, with a wider self from which\nsaving experiences flow in. Those who have such experiences distinctly\nenough and often enough to live in the light of them remain quite\nunmoved by criticism, from whatever quarter it may come, be it\nacademic or scientific, or be it merely the voice of logical\ncommon sense. They have had their vision and they _know_--that is\nenough--that we inhabit an invisible spiritual environment from which\nhelp comes, our soul being mysteriously one with a larger soul whose\ninstruments we are.\nOne may therefore plead, I think, that Fechner's ideas are not without\ndirect empirical verification. There is at any rate one side of life\nwhich would be easily explicable if those ideas were true, but of\nwhich there appears no clear explanation so long as we assume either\nwith naturalism that human consciousness is the highest consciousness\nthere is, or with dualistic theism that there is a higher mind in the\ncosmos, but that it is discontinuous with our own. It has always been\na matter of surprise with me that philosophers of the absolute should\nhave shown so little interest in this department of life, and so\nseldom put its phenomena in evidence, even when it seemed obvious that\npersonal experience of some kind must have made their confidence in\ntheir own vision so strong. The logician's bias has always been too\nmuch with them. They have preferred the thinner to the thicker method,\ndialectical abstraction being so much more dignified and academic than\nthe confused and unwholesome facts of personal biography.\nIn spite of rationalism's disdain for the particular, the personal,\nand the unwholesome, the drift of all the evidence we have seems to\nme to sweep us very strongly towards the belief in some form\nof superhuman life with which we may, unknown to ourselves, be\nco-conscious. We may be in the universe as dogs and cats are in our\nlibraries, seeing the books and hearing the conversation, but having\nno inkling of the meaning of it all. The intellectualist objections\nto this fall away when the authority of intellectualist logic is\nundermined by criticism, and then the positive empirical evidence\nremains. The analogies with ordinary psychology and with the facts of\npathology, with those of psychical research, so called, and with those\nof religious experience, establish, when taken together, a decidedly\n_formidable_ probability in favor of a general view of the world\nalmost identical with Fechner's. The outlines of the superhuman\nconsciousness thus made probable must remain, however, very vague, and\nthe number of functionally distinct 'selves' it comports and carries\nhas to be left entirely problematic. It may be polytheistically or\nit may be monotheistically conceived of. Fechner, with his distinct\nearth-soul functioning as our guardian angel, seems to me clearly\npolytheistic; but the word 'polytheism' usually gives offence, so\nperhaps it is better not to use it. Only one thing is certain, and\nthat is the result of our criticism of the absolute: the only way\nto escape from the paradoxes and perplexities that a consistently\nthought-out monistic universe suffers from as from a species of\nauto-intoxication--the mystery of the 'fall' namely, of reality\nlapsing into appearance, truth into error, perfection into\nimperfection; of evil, in short; the mystery of universal determinism,\nof the block-universe eternal and without a history, etc.;--the only\nway of escape, I say, from all this is to be frankly pluralistic and\nassume that the superhuman consciousness, however vast it may be, has\nitself an external environment, and consequently is finite. Present\nday monism carefully repudiates complicity with spinozistic monism. In\nthat, it explains, the many get dissolved in the one and lost, whereas\nin the improved idealistic form they get preserved in all their\nmanyness as the one's eternal object. The absolute itself is thus\nrepresented by absolutists as having a pluralistic object. But if even\nthe absolute has to have a pluralistic vision, why should we ourselves\nhesitate to be pluralists on our own sole account? Why should we\nenvelop our many with the 'one' that brings so much poison in its\ntrain?\nThe line of least resistance, then, as it seems to me, both in\ntheology and in philosophy, is to accept, along with the superhuman\nconsciousness, the notion that it is not all-embracing, the notion,\nin other words, that there is a God, but that he is finite, either in\npower or in knowledge, or in both at once. These, I need hardly tell\nyou, are the terms in which common men have usually carried on their\nactive commerce with God; and the monistic perfections that make the\nnotion of him so paradoxical practically and morally are the colder\naddition of remote professorial minds operating _in distans_ upon\nconceptual substitutes for him alone.\nWhy cannot 'experience' and 'reason' meet on this common ground? Why\ncannot they compromise? May not the godlessness usually but needlessly\nassociated with the philosophy of immediate experience give way to a\ntheism now seen to follow directly from that experience more widely\ntaken? and may not rationalism, satisfied with seeing her _a priori_\nproofs of God so effectively replaced by empirical evidence, abate\nsomething of her absolutist claims? Let God but have the least\ninfinitesimal _other_ of any kind beside him, and empiricism and\nrationalism might strike hands in a lasting treaty of peace. Both\nmight then leave abstract thinness behind them, and seek together, as\nscientific men seek, by using all the analogies and data within reach,\nto build up the most probable approximate idea of what the divine\nconsciousness concretely may be like. I venture to beg the younger\nOxford idealists to consider seriously this alternative. Few men are\nas qualified by their intellectual gifts to reap the harvests that\nseem certain to any one who, like Fechner and Bergson, will leave the\nthinner for the thicker path.\nCompromise and mediation are inseparable from the pluralistic\nphilosophy. Only monistic dogmatism can say of any of its hypotheses,\n'It is either that or nothing; take it or leave it just as it stands.'\nThe type of monism prevalent at Oxford has kept this steep and brittle\nattitude, partly through the proverbial academic preference for thin\nand elegant logical solutions, partly from a mistaken notion that the\nonly solidly grounded basis for religion was along those lines. If\nOxford men could be ignorant of anything, it might almost seem that\nthey had remained ignorant of the great empirical movement towards\na pluralistic panpsychic view of the universe, into which our own\ngeneration has been drawn, and which threatens to short-circuit their\nmethods entirely and become their religious rival unless they are\nwilling to make themselves its allies. Yet, wedded as they seem to\nbe to the logical machinery and technical apparatus of absolutism,\nI cannot but believe that their fidelity to the religious ideal in\ngeneral is deeper still. Especially do I find it hard to believe that\nthe more clerical adherents of the school would hold so fast to its\nparticular machinery if only they could be made to think that religion\ncould be secured in some other way. Let empiricism once become\nassociated with religion, as hitherto, through some strange\nmisunderstanding, it has been associated with irreligion, and I\nbelieve that a new era of religion as well as of philosophy will be\nready to begin. That great awakening of a new popular interest in\nphilosophy, which is so striking a phenomenon at the present day in\nall countries, is undoubtedly due in part to religious demands. As\nthe authority of past tradition tends more and more to crumble, men\nnaturally turn a wistful ear to the authority of reason or to the\nevidence of present fact. They will assuredly not be disappointed if\nthey open their minds to what the thicker and more radical empiricism\nhas to say. I fully believe that such an empiricism is a more natural\nally than dialectics ever were, or can be, of the religious life. It\nis true that superstitions and wild-growing over-beliefs of all\nsorts will undoubtedly begin to abound if the notion of higher\nconsciousnesses enveloping ours, of fechnerian earth-souls and the\nlike, grows orthodox and fashionable; still more will they superabound\nif science ever puts her approving stamp on the phenomena of which\nFrederic Myers so earnestly advocated the scientific recognition, the\nphenomena of psychic research so-called--and I myself firmly believe\nthat most of these phenomena are rooted in reality. But ought one\nseriously to allow such a timid consideration as that to deter one\nfrom following the evident path of greatest religious promise? Since\nwhen, in this mixed world, was any good thing given us in purest\noutline and isolation? One of the chief characteristics of life is\nlife's redundancy. The sole condition of our having anything, no\nmatter what, is that we should have so much of it, that we are\nfortunate if we do not grow sick of the sight and sound of it\naltogether. Everything is smothered in the litter that is fated to\naccompany it. Without too much you cannot have enough, of anything.\nLots of inferior books, lots of bad statues, lots of dull speeches, of\ntenth-rate men and women, as a condition of the few precious specimens\nin either kind being realized! The gold-dust comes to birth with the\nquartz-sand all around it, and this is as much a condition of religion\nas of any other excellent possession. There must be extrication; there\nmust be competition for survival; but the clay matrix and the noble\ngem must first come into being unsifted. Once extricated, the gem can\nbe examined separately, conceptualized, defined, and insulated. But\nthis process of extrication cannot be short-circuited--or if it is,\nyou get the thin inferior abstractions which we have seen, either\nthe hollow unreal god of scholastic theology, or the unintelligible\npantheistic monster, instead of the more living divine reality with\nwhich it appears certain that empirical methods tend to connect men in\nimagination.\nArrived at this point, I ask you to go back to my first lecture and\nremember, if you can, what I quoted there from your own Professor\nJacks--what he said about the philosopher himself being taken up into\nthe universe which he is accounting for. This is the fechnerian as\nwell as the hegelian view, and thus our end rejoins harmoniously our\nbeginning. Philosophies are intimate parts of the universe, they\nexpress something of its own thought of itself. A philosophy may\nindeed be a most momentous reaction of the universe upon itself. It\nmay, as I said, possess and handle itself differently in consequence\nof us philosophers, with our theories, being here; it may trust itself\nor mistrust itself the more, and, by doing the one or the other,\ndeserve more the trust or the mistrust. What mistrusts itself deserves\nmistrust.\nThis is the philosophy of humanism in the widest sense. Our\nphilosophies swell the current of being, add their character to it.\nThey are part of all that we have met, of all that makes us be. As\na French philosopher says, 'Nous sommes du r\u00e9el dans le r\u00e9el.' Our\nthoughts determine our acts, and our acts redetermine the previous\nnature of the world.\nThus does foreignness get banished from our world, and far more so\nwhen we take the system of it pluralistically than when we take it\nmonistically. We are indeed internal parts of God and not external\ncreations, on any possible reading of the panpsychic system. Yet\nbecause God is not the absolute, but is himself a part when the system\nis conceived pluralistically, his functions can be taken as not wholly\ndissimilar to those of the other smaller parts,--as similar to our\nfunctions consequently.\nHaving an environment, being in time, and working out a history just\nlike ourselves, he escapes from the foreignness from all that is\nhuman, of the static timeless perfect absolute.\nRemember that one of our troubles with that was its essential\nforeignness and monstrosity--there really is no other word for it than\nthat. Its having the all-inclusive form gave to it an essentially\nheterogeneous _nature_ from ourselves. And this great difference\nbetween absolutism and pluralism demands no difference in the\nuniverse's material content--it follows from a difference in the form\nalone. The all-form or monistic form makes the foreignness result, the\neach-form or pluralistic form leaves the intimacy undisturbed.\nNo matter what the content of the universe may be, if you only allow\nthat it is _many_ everywhere and always, that _nothing_ real escapes\nfrom having an environment; so far from defeating its rationality, as\nthe absolutists so unanimously pretend, you leave it in possession of\nthe maximum amount of rationality practically attainable by our minds.\nYour relations with it, intellectual, emotional, and active, remain\nfluent and congruous with your own nature's chief demands.\nIt would be a pity if the word 'rationality' were allowed to give us\ntrouble here. It is one of those eulogistic words that both sides\nclaim--for almost no one is willing to advertise his philosophy as a\nsystem of irrationality. But like most of the words which people used\neulogistically, the word 'rational' carries too many meanings. The\nmost objective one is that of the older logic--the connexion between\ntwo things is rational when you can infer one from the other, mortal\nfrom Socrates, _e.g.;_ and you can do that only when they have a\nquality in common. But this kind of rationality is just that logic\nof identity which all disciples of Hegel find insufficient. They\nsupersede it by the higher rationality of negation and contradiction\nand make the notion vague again. Then you get the aesthetic or\nteleologic kinds of rationality, saying that whatever fits in any way,\nwhatever is beautiful or good, whatever is purposive or gratifies\ndesire, is rational in so far forth. Then again, according to Hegel,\nwhatever is 'real' is rational. I myself said awhile ago that whatever\nlets loose any action which we are fond of exerting seems rational. It\nwould be better to give up the word 'rational' altogether than to get\ninto a merely verbal fight about who has the best right to keep it.\nPerhaps the words 'foreignness' and 'intimacy,' which I put forward\nin my first lecture, express the contrast I insist on better than the\nwords 'rationality' and 'irrationality'--let us stick to them, then.\nI now say that the notion of the 'one' breeds foreignness and that of\nthe 'many' intimacy, for reasons which I have urged at only too great\nlength, and with which, whether they convince you or not, I may\nsuppose that you are now well acquainted. But what at bottom is meant\nby calling the universe many or by calling it one?\nPragmatically interpreted, pluralism or the doctrine that it is\nmany means only that the sundry parts of reality _may be externally\nrelated_. Everything you can think of, however vast or inclusive, has\non the pluralistic view a genuinely 'external' environment of some\nsort or amount. Things are 'with' one another in many ways, but\nnothing includes everything, or dominates over everything. The word\n'and' trails along after every sentence. Something always escapes.\n'Ever not quite' has to be said of the best attempts made anywhere in\nthe universe at attaining all-inclusiveness. The pluralistic world is\nthus more like a federal republic than like an empire or a kingdom.\nHowever much may be collected, however much may report itself as\npresent at any effective centre of consciousness or action, something\nelse is self-governed and absent and unreduced to unity.\nMonism, on the other hand, insists that when you come down to reality\nas such, to the reality of realities, everything is present\nto _everything_ else in one vast instantaneous co-implicated\ncompleteness--nothing can in _any_ sense, functional or substantial,\nbe really absent from anything else, all things interpenetrate and\ntelescope together in the great total conflux.\nFor pluralism, all that we are required to admit as the constitution\nof reality is what we ourselves find empirically realized in every\nminimum of finite life. Briefly it is this, that nothing real is\nabsolutely simple, that every smallest bit of experience is a _multum\nin parvo_ plurally related, that each relation is one aspect,\ncharacter, or function, way of its being taken, or way of its taking\nsomething else; and that a bit of reality when actively engaged in one\nof these relations is not _by that very fact_ engaged in all the other\nrelations simultaneously. The relations are not _all_ what the French\ncall _solidaires_ with one another. Without losing its identity a\nthing can either take up or drop another thing, like the log I spoke\nof, which by taking up new carriers and dropping old ones can travel\nanywhere with a light escort.\nFor monism, on the contrary, everything, whether we realize it or not,\ndrags the whole universe along with itself and drops nothing. The log\nstarts and arrives with all its carriers supporting it. If a thing\nwere once disconnected, it could never be connected again, according\nto monism. The pragmatic difference between the two systems is thus a\ndefinite one. It is just thus, that if _a_ is once out of sight of _b_\nor out of touch with it, or, more briefly, 'out' of it at all, then,\naccording to monism, it must always remain so, they can never get\ntogether; whereas pluralism admits that on another occasion they may\nwork together, or in some way be connected again. Monism allows for\nno such things as 'other occasions' in reality--in _real_ or absolute\nreality, that is.\nThe difference I try to describe amounts, you see, to nothing more\nthan the difference between what I formerly called the each-form and\nthe all-form of reality. Pluralism lets things really exist in the\neach-form or distributively. Monism thinks that the all-form or\ncollective-unit form is the only form that is rational. The all-form\nallows of no taking up and dropping of connexions, for in the all the\nparts are essentially and eternally co-implicated. In the each-form,\non the contrary, a thing may be connected by intermediary things, with\na thing with which it has no immediate or essential connexion. It\nis thus at all times in many possible connexions which are not\nnecessarily actualized at the moment. They depend on which actual path\nof intermediation it may functionally strike into: the word 'or' names\na genuine reality. Thus, as I speak here, I may look ahead _or_ to the\nright _or_ to the left, and in either case the intervening space and\nair and ether enable me to see the faces of a different portion of\nthis audience. My being here is independent of any one set of these\nfaces.\nIf the each-form be the eternal form of reality no less than it is the\nform of temporal appearance, we still have a coherent world, and not\nan incarnate incoherence, as is charged by so many absolutists. Our\n'multiverse' still makes a 'universe'; for every part, tho it may not\nbe in actual or immediate connexion, is nevertheless in some possible\nor mediated connexion, with every other part however remote, through\nthe fact that each part hangs together with its very next neighbors in\ninextricable interfusion. The type of union, it is true, is different\nhere from the monistic type of _all-einheit_. It is not a universal\nco-implication, or integration of all things _durcheinander_. It is\nwhat I call the strung-along type, the type of continuity, contiguity,\nor concatenation. If you prefer greek words, you may call it the\nsynechistic type. At all events, you see that it forms a definitely\nconceivable alternative to the through-and-through unity of all things\nat once, which is the type opposed to it by monism. You see also that\nit stands or falls with the notion I have taken such pains to defend,\nof the through-and-through union of adjacent minima of experience, of\nthe confluence of every passing moment of concretely felt experience\nwith its immediately next neighbors. The recognition of this fact of\ncoalescence of next with next in concrete experience, so that all\nthe insulating cuts we make there are artificial products of the\nconceptualizing faculty, is what distinguishes the empiricism which\nI call 'radical,' from the bugaboo empiricism of the traditional\nrationalist critics, which (rightly or wrongly) is accused of chopping\nup experience into atomistic sensations, incapable of union with one\nanother until a purely intellectual principle has swooped down upon\nthem from on high and folded them in its own conjunctive categories.\nHere, then, you have the plain alternative, and the full mystery of\nthe difference between pluralism and monism, as clearly as I can\nset it forth on this occasion. It packs up into a nutshell:--Is the\nmanyness in oneness that indubitably characterizes the world we\ninhabit, a property only of the absolute whole of things, so that you\nmust postulate that one-enormous-whole indivisibly as the _prius_\nof there being any many at all--in other words, start with the\nrationalistic block-universe, entire, unmitigated, and complete?--or\ncan the finite elements have their own aboriginal forms of manyness in\noneness, and where they have no immediate oneness still be continued\ninto one another by intermediary terms--each one of these terms being\none with its next neighbors, and yet the total 'oneness' never getting\nabsolutely complete?\nThe alternative is definite. It seems to me, moreover, that the two\nhorns of it make pragmatically different ethical appeals--at least\nthey _may_ do so, to certain individuals. But if you consider the\npluralistic horn to be intrinsically irrational, self-contradictory,\nand absurd, I can now say no more in its defence. Having done what\nI could in my earlier lectures to break the edge of the\nintellectualistic _reductiones ad absurdum_, I must leave the issue\nin your hands. Whatever I may say, each of you will be sure to take\npluralism or leave it, just as your own sense of rationality moves and\ninclines. The only thing I emphatically insist upon is that it is a\nfully co-ordinate hypothesis with monism. This world _may_, in the\nlast resort, be a block-universe; but on the other hand it _may_ be a\nuniverse only strung-along, not rounded in and closed. Reality _may_\nexist distributively just as it sensibly seems to, after all. On that\npossibility I do insist.\nOne's general vision of the probable usually decides such\nalternatives. They illustrate what I once wrote of as the 'will to\nbelieve.' In some of my lectures at Harvard I have spoken of what\nI call the 'faith-ladder,' as something quite different from the\n_sorites_ of the logic-books, yet seeming to have an analogous form. I\nthink you will quickly recognize in yourselves, as I describe it, the\nmental process to which I give this name.\nA conception of the world arises in you somehow, no matter how. Is it\ntrue or not? you ask.\nIt _might_ be true somewhere, you say, for it is not\nself-contradictory.\nIt _may_ be true, you continue, even here and now.\nIt is _fit_ to be true, it would be _well if it were true_, it _ought_\nto be true, you presently feel.\nIt _must_ be true, something persuasive in you whispers next; and\nthen--as a final result--\nIt shall be _held for true_, you decide; it _shall be_ as if true, for\n_you_.\nAnd your acting thus may in certain special cases be a means of making\nit securely true in the end.\nNot one step in this process is logical, yet it is the way in which\nmonists and pluralists alike espouse and hold fast to their visions.\nIt is life exceeding logic, it is the practical reason for which the\ntheoretic reason finds arguments after the conclusion is once there.\nIn just this way do some of us hold to the unfinished pluralistic\nuniverse; in just this way do others hold to the timeless universe\neternally complete.\nMeanwhile the incompleteness of the pluralistic universe, thus assumed\nand held to as the most probable hypothesis, is also represented by\nthe pluralistic philosophy as being self-reparative through us, as\ngetting its disconnections remedied in part by our behavior. 'We use\nwhat we are and have, to know; and what we know, to be and have still\nmore.'[1] Thus do philosophy and reality, theory and action, work in\nthe same circle indefinitely.\nI have now finished these poor lectures, and as you look back on them,\nthey doubtless seem rambling and inconclusive enough. My only hope is\nthat they may possibly have proved suggestive; and if indeed they have\nbeen suggestive of one point of method, I am almost willing to let\nall other suggestions go. That point is that _it is high time for the\nbasis of discussion in these questions to be broadened and thickened\nup_. It is for that that I have brought in Fechner and Bergson, and\ndescriptive psychology and religious experiences, and have ventured\neven to hint at psychical research and other wild beasts of the\nphilosophic desert. Owing possibly to the fact that Plato and\nAristotle, with their intellectualism, are the basis of philosophic\nstudy here, the Oxford brand of transcendentalism seems to me to have\nconfined itself too exclusively to thin logical considerations, that\nwould hold good in all conceivable worlds, worlds of an empirical\nconstitution entirely different from ours. It is as if the actual\npeculiarities of the world that is were entirely irrelevant to the\ncontent of truth. But they cannot be irrelevant; and the philosophy\nof the future must imitate the sciences in taking them more and more\nelaborately into account. I urge some of the younger members of\nthis learned audience to lay this hint to heart. If you can do so\neffectively, making still more concrete advances upon the path which\nFechner and Bergson have so enticingly opened up, if you can gather\nphilosophic conclusions of any kind, monistic or pluralistic, from\nthe _particulars of life_, I will say, as I now do say, with the\ncheerfullest of hearts, 'Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes, but\nring the fuller minstrel in.'\nNOTES\nLECTURE I\nNote 1, page 5.--Bailey: _op. cit._, First Series, p. 52.\nNote 2, page 11.--_Smaller Logic_, \u00a7 194.\nNote 3, page 16.--_Exploratio philosophica_, Part I, 1865, pp.\nxxxviii, 130.\nNote 4, page 20.--Hinneberg: _Die Kultur der Gegenwart: Systematische\nPhilosophie_.

Understood\nin one way, the thesis sounds indefensible, for by concepts we\ncertainly increase our knowledge about things, and that seems a\ntheoretical achievement, whatever practical achievements may follow in\nits train. Indeed, M. Bergson might seem to be easily refutable out of\nhis own mouth. His philosophy pretends, if anything, to give a better\ninsight into truth than rationalistic philosophies give: yet what is\nit in itself if not a conceptual system? Does its author not reason by\nconcepts exclusively in his very attempt to show that they can give no\ninsight?\nTo this particular objection, at any rate, it is easy to reply.\nIn using concepts of his own to discredit the theoretic claims of\nconcepts generally, Bergson does not contradict, but on the contrary\nemphatically illustrates his own view of their practical role, for\nthey serve in his hands only to 'orient' us, to show us to what\nquarter we must _practically turn_ if we wish to gain that completer\ninsight into reality which he denies that they can give. He directs\nour hopes away from them and towards the despised sensible flux. _What\nhe reaches by their means is thus only a new practical attitude_. He\nbut restores, against the vetoes of intellectualist philosophy, our\nnaturally cordial relations with sensible experience and common sense.\nThis service is surely only practical; but it is a service for which\nwe may be almost immeasurably grateful. To trust our senses again with\na good philosophic conscience!--who ever conferred on us so valuable a\nfreedom before?\nBy making certain distinctions and additions it seems easy to meet the\nother counts of the indictment. Concepts are realities of a new order,\nwith particular relations between them. These relations are just as\nmuch directly perceived, when we compare our various concepts, as the\ndistance between two sense-objects is perceived when we look at it.\nConception is an operation which gives us material for new acts of\nperception, then; and when the results of these are written down,\nwe get those bodies of 'mental truth' (as Locke called it) known as\nmathematics, logic, and _a priori_ metaphysics. To know all this truth\nis a theoretic achievement, indeed, but it is a narrow one; for the\nrelations between conceptual objects as such are only the static\nones of bare comparison, as difference or sameness, congruity or\ncontradiction, inclusion or exclusion. Nothing _happens_ in the realm\nof concepts; relations there are 'eternal' only. The theoretic gain\nfails so far, therefore, to touch even the outer hem of the real\nworld, the world of causal and dynamic relations, of activity and\nhistory. To gain insight into all that moving life, Bergson is right\nin turning us away from conception and towards perception.\nBy combining concepts with percepts, _we can draw maps of the\ndistribution_ of other percepts in distant space and time. To know\nthis distribution is of course a theoretic achievement, but the\nachievement is extremely limited, it cannot be effected without\npercepts, and even then what it yields is only static relations. From\nmaps we learn positions only, and the position of a thing is but the\nslightest kind of truth about it; but, being indispensable for forming\nour plans of action, the conceptual map-making has the enormous\npractical importance on which Bergson so rightly insists.\nBut concepts, it will be said, do not only give us eternal truths\nof comparison and maps of the positions of things, they bring new\n_values_ into life. In their mapping function they stand to perception\nin general in the same relation in which sight and hearing stand to\ntouch--Spencer calls these higher senses only organs of anticipatory\ntouch. But our eyes and ears also open to us worlds of independent\nglory: music and decorative art result, and an incredible enhancement\nof life's value follows. Even so does the conceptual world bring new\nranges of value and of motivation to our life. Its maps not only serve\nus practically, but the mere mental possession of such vast pictures\nis of itself an inspiring good. New interests and incitements, and\nfeelings of power, sublimity, and admiration are aroused.\nAbstractness _per se_ seems to have a touch of ideality. ROYCE'S\n'loyalty to loyalty' is an excellent example. 'Causes,' as\nanti-slavery, democracy, liberty, etc., dwindle when realized in their\nsordid particulars. The veritable 'cash-value' of the idea seems to\ncleave to it only in the abstract status. Truth at large, as ROYCE\ncontends, in his _Philosophy of Loyalty_, appears another thing\naltogether from the true particulars in which it is best to believe.\nIt transcends in value all those 'expediencies,' and is something to\nlive for, whether expedient or inexpedient. Truth with a big T is a\n'momentous issue'; truths in detail are 'poor scraps,' mere 'crumbling\nsuccesses.' (_Op. cit._, Lecture VII, especially \u00a7 v.)\nIs, now, such bringing into existence of a new _value_ to be regarded\nas a theoretic achievement? The question is a nice one, for altho a\nvalue is in one sense an objective quality perceived, the essence of\nthat quality is its relation to the will, and consists in its being\na dynamogenic spur that makes our action different. So far as their\nvalue-creating function goes, it would thus appear that concepts\nconnect themselves more with our active than with our theoretic life,\nso here again Bergson's formulation seems unobjectionable. Persons who\nhave certain concepts are animated otherwise, pursue their own\nvital careers differently. It doesn't necessarily follow that they\nunderstand other vital careers more intimately.\nAgain it may be said that we combine old concepts into new ones,\nconceiving thus such realities as the ether, God, souls, or what not,\nof which our sensible life alone would leave us altogether ignorant.\nThis surely is an increase of our knowledge, and may well be called\na theoretical achievement. Yet here again Bergson's criticisms hold\ngood. Much as conception may tell us _about_ such invisible objects,\nit sheds no ray of light into their interior. The completer, indeed,\nour definitions of ether-waves, atoms, Gods, or souls become, the less\ninstead of the more intelligible do they appear to us. The learned\nin such things are consequently beginning more and more to ascribe a\nsolely instrumental value to our concepts of them. Ether and molecules\nmay be like co-ordinates and averages, only so many crutches by the\nhelp of which we practically perform the operation of getting about\namong our sensible experiences.\nWe see from these considerations how easily the question of whether\nthe function of concepts is theoretical or practical may grow into\na logomachy. It may be better from this point of view to refuse to\nrecognize the alternative as a sharp one. The sole thing that is\ncertain in the midst of it all is that Bergson is absolutely right\nin contending that the whole life of activity and change is inwardly\nimpenetrable to conceptual treatment, and that it opens itself only to\nsympathetic apprehension at the hands of immediate feeling. All the\n_whats_ as well as the _thats_ of reality, relational as well as\nterminal, are in the end contents of immediate concrete perception.\nYet the remoter unperceived _arrangements_, temporal, spatial, and\nlogical, of these contents, are also something that we need to know as\nwell for the pleasure of the knowing as for the practical help. We may\ncall this need of arrangement a theoretic need or a practical need,\naccording as we choose to lay the emphasis; but Bergson is accurately\nright when he limits conceptual knowledge to arrangement, and when he\ninsists that arrangement is the mere skirt and skin of the whole of\nwhat we ought to know.\nNote 2, page 266.--Gaston Rageot, _Revue Philosophique_, vol. lxiv, p.\n85 (July, 1907).\nNote 3, page 268.--I have myself talked in other ways as plausibly\nas I could, in my _Psychology_, and talked truly (as I believe) in\ncertain selected cases; but for other cases the natural way invincibly\ncomes back.\nLECTURE VII\nNote 1, page 278.--_Introduction to Hume_, 1874, p. 151.\nNote 2, page 279.--_Ibid._, pp. 16, 21, 36, _et passim_.\nNote 3, page 279.--See, _inter alia_, the chapter on the 'Stream of\nThought' in my own Psychologies; H.

The active\nsense of living which we all enjoy, before reflection shatters our\ninstinctive world for us, is self-luminous and suggests no paradoxes.\nIts difficulties are disappointments and uncertainties. They are not\nintellectual contradictions.\nWhen the reflective intellect gets at work, however, it discovers\nincomprehensibilities in the flowing process. Distinguishing its\nelements and parts, it gives them separate names, and what it thus\ndisjoins it cannot easily put together. Pyrrhonism accepts the\nirrationality and revels in its dialectic elaboration. Other\nphilosophies try, some by ignoring, some by resisting, and some by\nturning the dialectic procedure against itself, negating its first\nnegations, to restore the fluent sense of life again, and let\nredemption take the place of innocence. The perfection with which any\nphilosophy may do this is the measure of its human success and of its\nimportance in philosophic history. In an article entitled 'A world of\npure experience,[2] I tried my own hand sketchily at\n[Footnote 1: Reprinted from the _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology,\nand Scientific Methods_, vol. ii, New York, 1905, with slight verbal\nrevision.]\n[Footnote 2: _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific\nMethods_, vol. i, No. 20, p. 566.]\nthe problem, resisting certain first steps of dialectics by insisting\nin a general way that the immediately experienced conjunctive\nrelations are as real as anything else. If my sketch is not to appear\ntoo _n\u00e4if_, I must come closer to details, and in the present essay I\npropose to do so.\nI\n'Pure experience' is the name which I gave to the immediate flux of\nlife which furnishes the material to our later reflection with its\nconceptual categories. Only new-born babes, or men in semi-coma\nfrom sleep, drugs, illnesses, or blows, may be assumed to have an\nexperience pure in the literal sense of a _that_ which is not yet any\ndefinite _what_, tho ready to be all sorts of whats; full both of\noneness and of manyness, but in respects that don't appear; changing\nthroughout, yet so confusedly that its phases interpenetrate and no\npoints, either of distinction or of identity, can be caught. Pure\nexperience in this state is but another name for feeling or sensation.\nBut the flux of it no sooner comes than it tends to fill itself with\nemphases, and these salient parts become identified and fixed and\nabstracted; so that experience now flows as if shot through with\nadjectives and nouns and prepositions and conjunctions. Its purity is\nonly a relative term, meaning the proportional amount of unverbalized\nsensation which it still embodies.\nFar back as we go, the flux, both as a whole and in its parts, is that\nof things conjunct and separated. The great continua of time, space,\nand the self envelop everything, betwixt them, and flow together\nwithout interfering. The things that they envelop come as separate in\nsome ways and as continuous in others. Some sensations coalesce with\nsome ideas, and others are irreconcilable. Qualities compenetrate one\nspace, or exclude each other from it. They cling together persistently\nin groups that move as units, or else they separate. Their changes are\nabrupt or discontinuous; and their kinds resemble or differ; and, as\nthey do so, they fall into either even or irregular series.\nIn all this the continuities and the discontinuities are absolutely\nco-ordinate matters of immediate feeling. The conjunctions are\nas primordial elements of 'fact' as are the distinctions and\ndisjunctions. In the same act by which I feel that this passing minute\nis a new pulse of my life, I feel that the old life continues into it,\nand the feeling of continuance in no wise jars upon the simultaneous\nfeeling of a novelty. They, too, compenetrate harmoniously.\nPrepositions, copulas, and conjunctions, 'is,' 'isn't,' 'then,'\n'before,' 'in,' 'on,' 'beside,' 'between,' 'next,' 'like,' 'unlike,'\n'as,' 'but,' flower out of the stream of pure experience, the stream\nof concretes or the sensational stream, as naturally as nouns and\nadjectives do, and they melt into it again as fluidly when we apply\nthem to a new portion of the stream.\nII\nIf now we ask why we must translate experience from a more concrete\nor pure into a more intellectualized form, filling it with ever more\nabounding conceptual distinctions, rationalism and naturalism give\ndifferent replies.\nThe rationalistic answer is that the theoretic life is absolute and\nits interests imperative; that to understand is simply the duty of\nman; and that who questions this need not be argued with, for by the\nfact of arguing he gives away his case.\nThe naturalist answer is that the environment kills as well as\nsustains us, and that the tendency of raw experience to extinguish the\nexperient himself is lessened just in the degree in which the elements\nin it that have a practical bearing upon life are analyzed out of the\ncontinuum and verbally fixed and coupled together, so that we may know\nwhat is in the wind for us and get ready to react in time. Had pure\nexperience, the naturalist says, been always perfectly healthy, there\nwould never have arisen the necessity of isolating or verbalizing\nany of its terms. We should just have experienced inarticulately and\nunintellectually enjoyed. This leaning on 'reaction' in the naturalist\naccount implies that, whenever we intellectualize a relatively pure\nexperience, we ought to do so for the sake of redescending to the\npurer or more concrete level again; and that if an intellect stays\naloft among its abstract terms and generalized relations, and does not\nreinsert itself with its conclusions into some particular point of\nthe immediate stream of life, it fails to finish out its function and\nleaves its normal race unrun.\nMost rationalists nowadays will agree that naturalism gives a true\nenough account of the way in which our intellect arose at first, but\nthey will deny these latter implications. The case, they will say,\nresembles that of sexual love. Originating in the animal need\nof getting another generation born, this passion has developed\nsecondarily such imperious spiritual needs that, if you ask why\nanother generation ought to be born at all, the answer is: 'Chiefly\nthat love may go on.' Just so with our intellect: it originated as a\npractical means of serving life; but it has developed incidentally the\nfunction of understanding absolute truth; and life itself now seems to\nbe given chiefly as a means by which that function may be prosecuted.\nBut truth and the understanding of it lie among the abstracts and\nuniversals, so the intellect now carries on its higher business wholly\nin this region, without any need of redescending into pure experience\nagain.\nIf the contrasted tendencies which I thus designate as naturalistic\nand rationalistic are not recognized by the reader, perhaps an example\nwill make them more concrete. Mr. Bradley, for instance, is an\nultra-rationalist. He admits that our intellect is primarily\npractical, but says that, for philosophers, the practical need is\nsimply Truth.[1] Truth, moreover, must be assumed 'consistent.'\nImmediate experience has to be broken into subjects and qualities,\nterms and relations, to be understood as truth at all. Yet when\nso broken it is less consistent than ever. Taken raw, it is all\nundistinguished. Intellectualized, it is all distinction without\noneness. 'Such an arrangement may _work_, but the theoretic problem is\nnot solved' (p. 23). The question is, '_How_ the diversity can exist\nin harmony with the oneness' (p. 118). To go back to pure experience\nis unavailing. 'Mere feeling gives no answer to our riddle' (p. 104).\nEven if your intuition is a fact, it is not an _understanding_. 'It is\na mere experience, and furnishes no consistent view' (pp. 108-109).\nThe experiences offered as facts or truths 'I find that my intellect\nrejects because they contradict themselves. They offer a complex of\ndiversities conjoined in a way which it feels is not its way and which\nit cannot repeat as its own.... For to be satisfied, my intellect must\nunderstand, and it cannot understand by taking a congeries in\nthe lump' (p. 570). So Mr. Bradley, in the sole interests of\n'understanding' (as he conceives that function), turns his back on\nfinite\n[Footnote 1: _Appearance and Reality_, pp. 152-133.]\nexperience forever. Truth must lie in the opposite direction,\nthe direction of the absolute; and this kind of rationalism and\nnaturalism, or (as I will now call it) pragmatism, walk thenceforward\nupon opposite paths. For the one, those intellectual products are most\ntrue which, turning their face towards the absolute, come nearest to\nsymbolizing its ways of uniting the many and the one. For the other,\nthose are most true which most successfully dip back into the finite\nstream of feeling and grow most easily confluent with some particular\nwave or wavelet. Such confluence not only proves the intellectual\noperation to have been true (as an addition may 'prove' that a\nsubtraction is already rightly performed), but it constitutes,\naccording to pragmatism, all that we mean by calling it true. Only in\nso far as they lead us, successfully or unsuccessfully, into sensible\nexperience again, are our abstracts and universals true or false at\nall.\nIII\nIn Section the 6th of my article, 'A world of pure experience,' I\nadopted in a general way the common-sense belief that one and the same\nworld is cognized by our different minds; but I left undiscussed the\ndialectical arguments which maintain that this is logically absurd.\nThe usual reason given for its being absurd is that it assumes one\nobject (to wit, the world) to stand in two relations at once; to my\nmind, namely, and again to yours; whereas a term taken in a second\nrelation cannot logically be the same term which it was at first.\nI have heard this reason urged so often in discussing with\nabsolutists, and it would destroy my radical empiricism so utterly,\nif it were valid, that I am bound to give it an attentive ear, and\nseriously to search its strength.\nFor instance, let the matter in dispute be a term _M_, asserted to be\non the one hand related to _L_, and on the other to _N_; and let the\ntwo cases of relation be symbolized by _L--M_ and _M--N_ respectively.\nWhen, now, I assume that the experience may immediately come and be\ngiven in the shape _L--M--N_, with no trace of doubling or internal\nfission in the _M_, I am told that this is all a popular delusion;\nthat _L--M--N_ logically means two different experiences, _L--M_ and\n_M--N_, namely; and that although the absolute may, and indeed must,\nfrom its superior point of view, read its own kind of unity into _M_'s\ntwo editions, yet as elements in finite experience the two _M_'s\nlie irretrievably asunder, and the world between them is broken and\nunbridged.\nIn arguing this dialectic thesis, one must avoid slipping from the\nlogical into the physical point of view. It would be easy, in taking\na concrete example to fix one's ideas by, to choose one in which the\nletter _M_ should stand for a collective noun of some sort, which\nnoun, being related to _L_ by one of its parts and to _N_ by another,\nwould inwardly be two things when it stood outwardly in both\nrelations. Thus, one might say: 'David Hume, who weighed so many stone\nby his body, influences posterity by his doctrine.' The body and the\ndoctrine are two things, between which our finite minds can discover\nno real sameness, though the same name covers both of them. And then,\none might continue: 'Only an absolute is capable of uniting such a\nnon-identity.' We must, I say, avoid this sort of example; for the\ndialectic insight, if true at all, must apply to terms and relations\nuniversally. It must be true of abstract units as well as of nouns\ncollective; and if we prove it by concrete examples, we must take the\nsimplest, so as to avoid irrelevant material suggestions.\nTaken thus in all its generality, the absolutist contention seems\nto use as its major premise Hume's notion 'that all our distinct\nperceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives\nany real connexion among distinct existences.' Undoubtedly, since we\nuse two phrases in talking first about '_M_'s relation to _L_' and\nthen again about '_M_'s relation to _N_,' we must be having, or must\nhave had, two distinct perceptions;--and the rest would then seem to\nfollow duly. But the starting-point of the reasoning here seems to be\nthe fact of the two _phrases_; and this suggests that the argument\nmay be merely verbal. Can it be that the whole dialectic achievement\nconsists in attributing to the experience talked-about a constitution\nsimilar to that of the language in which we describe it? Must we\nassert the objective doubleness of the _M_ merely because we have to\nname it twice over when we name its two relations?\nCandidly, I can think of no other reason than this for the dialectic\nconclusion![1] for, if we think, not of our words, but of any simple\nconcrete matter which they may be held to signify, the experience\nitself belies the paradox asserted. We use indeed two separate\nconcepts in analyzing our object, but we know them all the while to be\nbut substitutional, and that the _M_ in _L--M_ and the _M_ in _M--N_\n_mean_ (_i.e._, are capable of leading to and terminating in) one\nself-same piece, _M_, of sensible experience. This persistent identity\nof certain units, or emphases, or points, or objects, or members--call\nthem what you will--of the experience-continuum, is just one of\nthose conjunctive features of it, on which I am obliged to insist so\nemphatically. For samenesses are parts of experience's indefeasible\nstructure. When I hear a bell-stroke and, as life flows on, its\nafter-image dies away, I still hark back to it as 'that same\n[Footnote 1: Technically, it seems classable as a 'fallacy of\ncomposition.' A duality, predicable of the two wholes, _L--M_ and\n_M--N_, is forthwith predicated of one of their parts, _M_.]\nbell-stroke.' When I see a thing _M_, with _L_ to the left of it and\n_N_ to the right of it, I see it _as_ one _M_; and if you tell me I\nhave had to 'take' it twice, I reply that if I 'took' it a thousand\ntimes, I should still _see_ it as a unit.[1] Its unity is aboriginal,\njust as the multiplicity of my successive takings is aboriginal. It\ncomes unbroken as _that M_, as a singular which I encounter; they come\nbroken, as _those_ takings, as my plurality of operations. The unity\nand the separateness are strictly co-ordinate. I do not easily fathom\nwhy my opponents should find the separateness so much more easily\nunderstandable that they must needs infect the whole of finite\nexperience with it, and relegate the unity (now taken as a bare\npostulate and no longer as a thing positively perceivable) to the\nregion of the absolute's mysteries. I do not easily fathom this, I\nsay, for the said opponents are above mere verbal quibbling; yet all\nthat I can catch in their talk is the substitution of what is true of\ncertain words for what is true of what they signify. They stay with\nthe words,--not returning to the stream of life whence all the meaning\nof them came, and which is always ready to reabsorb them.\n[Footnote 1: I may perhaps refer here to my _Principles of\nPsychology_, vol. i, pp. 459 ff. It really seems 'weird' to have to\nargue (as I am forced now to do) for the notion that it is one sheet\nof paper (with its two surfaces and all that lies between) which is\nboth under my pen and on the table while I write--the 'claim' that it\nis two sheets seems so brazen. Yet I sometimes suspect the absolutists\nof sincerity!]\nIV\nFor aught this argument proves, then, we may continue to believe that\none thing can be known by many knowers. But the denial of one thing in\nmany relations is but one application of a still profounder dialectic\ndifficulty. Man can't be good, said the sophists, for man is _man_ and\n_good_ is good; and Hegel and Herbart in their day, more recently H.\nSpir, and most recently and elaborately of all, Mr. Bradley, inform us\nthat a term can logically only be a punctiform unit, and that not one\nof the conjunctive relations between things, which experience seems to\nyield, is rationally possible.\nOf course, if true, this cuts off radical empiricism without even a\nshilling. Radical empiricism takes conjunctive relations at their\nface-value, holding them to be as real as the terms united by them.\nThe world it represents as a collection, some parts of which are\nconjunctively and others disjunctively related. Two parts, themselves\ndisjoined, may nevertheless hang together by intermediaries with which\nthey are severally connected, and the whole world eventually may hang\ntogether similarly, inasmuch as _some_ path of conjunctive transition\nby which to pass from one of its parts to another may always be\ndiscernible. Such determinately various hanging-together may be called\n_concatenated_ union, to distinguish it from the 'through-and-through'\ntype of union, 'each in all and all in each' (union of _total\nconflux_, as one might call it), which monistic systems hold to obtain\nwhen things are taken in their absolute reality. In a concatenated\nworld a partial conflux often is experienced. Our concepts and our\nsensations are confluent; successive states of the same ego, and\nfeelings of the same body are confluent. Where the experience is not\nof conflux, it may be of conterminousness (things with but one thing\nbetween); or of contiguousness (nothing between); or of likeness; or\nof nearness; or of simultaneousness; or of in-ness; or of on-ness; or\nof for-ness; or of simple with-ness; or even of mere and-ness, which\nlast relation would make of however disjointed a world otherwise, at\nany rate for that occasion a universe 'of discourse.' Now Mr. Bradley\ntells us that none of these relations, as we actually experience them,\ncan possibly be real.[1] My next duty, accordingly, must be to rescue\nradical empiricism from Mr. Bradley. Fortunately, as it seems to me,\nhis general contention, that the very notion of relation is\n[Footnote 1: Here again the reader must beware of slipping from\nlogical into phenomenal considerations. It may well be that we\n_attribute_ a certain relation falsely, because the circumstances of\nthe case, being complex, have deceived us. At a railway station we\nmay take our own train, and not the one that fills our window, to be\nmoving. We here put motion in the wrong place in the world, but in its\noriginal place the motion is a part of reality. What Mr. Bradley\nmeans is nothing like this, but rather that such things as motion\nare nowhere real, and that, even in their aboriginal and empirically\nincorrigible seats, relations are impossible of comprehension.]\nunthinkable clearly, has been successfully met by many critics.[1]\nIt is a burden to the flesh, and an injustice both to readers and to\nthe previous writers, to repeat good arguments already printed. So,\nin noticing Mr. Bradley, I will confine myself to the interests of\nradical empiricism solely.\nV\nThe first duty of radical empiricism, taking given conjunctions at\ntheir face-value, is to class some of them as more intimate and some\nas more external. When two terms are _similar_, their very natures\nenter into the relation. Being _what_ they are, no matter where or\nwhen, the likeness never can be denied, if asserted. It continues\npredicable as long as the terms continue. Other relations, the _where_\nand the _when_, for example, seem adventitious. The sheet of paper\nmay be 'off' or 'on' the table, for example; and in either case the\nrelation involves only the outside of its terms. Having an outside,\nboth of them, they contribute by it to the relation. It is external:\nthe term's inner nature is irrelevant to it. Any\n[Footnote 1: Particularly so by Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, in his\n_Man and the Cosmos_; by L.T. Hobhouse, in chapter xii (the Validity\nof Judgment) of his _Theory of Knowledge_; and by F.C.S. Schiller,\nin his _Humanism_, Essay XI. Other fatal reviews (in my opinion) are\nHodder's, in the _Psychological Review_, vol. i, 307; Stout's, in\nthe _Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society_, 1901-02, p. 1; and\nMacLennan's, in the _Journal of Philosophy_, etc., vol. i, 403.]\nbook, any table, may fall into the relation, which is created _pro hac\nvice_, not by their existence, but by their casual situation. It\nis just because so many of the conjunctions of experience seem so\nexternal that a philosophy of pure experience must tend to pluralism\nin its ontology. So far as things have space-relations, for example,\nwe are free to imagine them with different origins even. If they could\nget to _be_, and get into space at all, then they may have done so\nseparately. Once there, however, they are _additives_ to one another,\nand, with no prejudice to their natures, all sorts of space-relations\nmay supervene between them. The question of how things could come\nto be, anyhow, is wholly different from the question what their\nrelations, once the being accomplished, may consist in.\nMr. Bradley now affirms that such external relations as the\nspace-relations which we here talk of must hold of entirely different\nsubjects from those of which the absence of such relations might\na moment previously have been plausibly asserted. Not only is the\n_situation_ different when the book is on the table, but the _book\nitself_ is different as a book, from what it was when it was off the\ntable. He admits that 'such external relations\n[Footnote 1: Once more, don't slip from logical into physical\nsituations. Of course, if the table be wet, it will moisten the book,\nor if it be slight enough and the book heavy enough, the book will\nbreak it down. But such collateral phenomena are not the point at\nissue. The point is whether the successive relations 'on' and 'not-on'\ncan rationally (not physically) hold of the same constant terms,\nabstractly taken. Professor A.E. Taylor drops from logical into\nmaterial considerations when he instances color-contrast as a proof\nthat _A_, 'as contra-distinguished from _B_, is not the same thing as\nmere _A_ not in any way affected' (_Elements of Metaphysics_, 1903, p.\n145). Note the substitution, for 'related,' of the word 'affected,'\nwhich begs the whole question.]\nseem possible and even existing.... That you do not alter what you\ncompare or rearrange in space seems to common sense quite obvious,\nand that on the other side there are as obvious difficulties does not\noccur to common sense at all. And I will begin by pointing out these\ndifficulties.... There is a relation in the result, and this relation,\nwe hear, is to make no difference in its terms. But, if so, to what\ndoes it make a difference? [_doesn't it make a difference to us\nonlookers, at least?_] and what is the meaning and sense of qualifying\nthe terms by it? [_Surely the meaning is to tell the truth about their\nrelative position_.[1]] If, in short, it is external to the terms, how\ncan it possibly be true _of_ them? [_Is it the 'intimacy' suggested by\nthe little word 'of,' here, which I have underscored, that is the root\nof Mr. Bradley's trouble?_].... If the terms from their inner nature\ndo not enter into the relation, then, so far as they are concerned,\nthey seem related for no reason at all.... Things are spatially\nrelated, first in one way, and then become related in another way, and\nyet in no way themselves\n[Footnote 1: But 'is there any sense,' asks Mr. Bradley, peevishly,\non p. 579, 'and if so, what sense, in truth that is only outside and\n\"about\" things?' Surely such a question may be left unanswered.]\nare altered; for the relations, it is said, are but external. But I\nreply that, if so, I cannot _understand_ the leaving by the terms of\none set of relations and their adoption of another fresh set. The\nprocess and its result to the terms, if they contribute nothing to it\n[_surely they contribute to it all there is 'of' it!_] seem irrational\nthroughout. [_If 'irrational' here means simply 'non-rational,'\nor non-deducible from the essence of either term singly, it is no\nreproach; if it means 'contradicting' such essence, Mr. Bradley should\nshow wherein and how_.] But, if they contribute anything, they must\nsurely be affected internally. [_Why so, if they contribute only their\nsurface? In such relations as 'on,' 'a foot away,' 'between,' 'next,'\netc., only surfaces are in question_.] ... If the terms contribute\nanything whatever, then the terms are affected [_inwardly altered?_]\nby the arrangement.... That for working purposes we treat, and do well\nto treat, some relations as external merely, I do not deny, and that\nof course is not the question at issue here. That question is ...\nwhether in the end and in principle a mere external relation [_i.e.,\na relation which can change without forcing its terms to change their\nnature simultaneously_] is possible and forced on us by the facts.'[1]\nMr. Bradley next reverts to the antinomies of space, which, according\nto him, prove it to be unreal, although it appears as so prolific a\nmedium of external relations;\n[Footnote 1: _Appearance and Reality_, 2d edition, pp. 575-576.]\nand he then concludes that 'Irrationality and externality cannot be\nthe last truth about things. Somewhere there must be a reason why this\nand that appear together. And this reason and reality must reside in\nthe whole from which terms and relations are abstractions, a whole in\nwhich their internal connexion must lie, and out of which from the\nbackground appear those fresh results which never could have come\nfrom the premises' (p. 577). And he adds that 'Where the whole is\ndifferent, the terms that qualify and contribute to it must so far be\ndifferent.... They are altered so far only [_how far? farther than\nexternally, yet not through and through?_], but still they are\naltered.... I must insist that in each case the terms are qualified by\ntheir whole [_qualified how?--do their external relations, situations,\ndates, etc., changed as these are in the new whole, fail to qualify\nthem 'far' enough?_], and that in the second case there is a whole\nwhich differs both logically and psychologically from the first whole;\nand I urge that in contributing to the change the terms so far are\naltered' (p. 579).\nNot merely the relations, then, but the terms are altered: _und\nzwar_ 'so far.' But just _how_ far is the whole problem; and\n'through-and-through' would seem (in spite of Mr. Bradley's somewhat\nundecided utterances[1])\n[Footnote 1: I say 'undecided,' because, apart from the 'so far,'\nwhich sounds terribly half-hearted, there are passages in these very\npages in which Mr. Bradley admits the pluralistic thesis. Read, for\nexample, what he says, on p. 578, of a billiard ball keeping its\n'character' unchanged, though, in its change of place, its 'existence'\ngets altered; or what he says, on p. 579, of the possibility that\nan abstract quality A, B, or C, in a thing, 'may throughout remain\nunchanged' although the thing be altered; or his admission that in\nred-hairedness, both as analyzed out of a man and when given with\nthe rest of him, there may be 'no change' (p. 580). Why does he\nimmediately add that for the pluralist to plead the non-mutation of\nsuch abstractions would be an _ignoratio elenchi_? It is impossible to\nadmit it to be such. The entire _elenchus_ and inquest is just as to\nwhether parts which you can abstract from existing wholes can also\ncontribute to other wholes without changing their inner nature. If\nthey can thus mould various wholes into new _gestalt-qualit\u00e4ten_,\nthen it follows that the same elements are logically able to exist in\ndifferent wholes [whether physically able would depend on\nadditional hypotheses]; that partial changes are thinkable, and\nthrough-and-through change not a dialectic necessity; that monism is\nonly an hypothesis; and that an additively constituted universe is\na rationally respectable hypothesis also. All the theses of radical\nempiricism, in short, follow.]\nto be the full bradleyan answer. The 'whole' which he here treats as\nprimary and determinative of each part's manner of 'contributing,'\nsimply _must_, when it alters, alter in its entirety. There _must_\nbe total conflux of its parts, each into and through each other. The\n'must' appears here as a _Machtspruch_, as an _ipse dixit_ of Mr.\nBradley's absolutistically tempered 'understanding,' for he candidly\nconfesses that how the parts _do_ differ as they contribute to\ndifferent wholes, is unknown to him (p. 578).\nAlthough I have every wish to comprehend the authority by which Mr.\nBradley's understanding speaks, his words leave me wholly unconverted.\n'External relations' stand with their withers all unwrung, and remain,\nfor aught he proves to the contrary, not only practically workable,\nbut also perfectly intelligible factors of reality.\nVI\nMr. Bradley's understanding shows the most extraordinary power of\nperceiving separations and the most extraordinary impotence in\ncomprehending conjunctions. One would naturally say 'neither or both,'\nbut not so Mr. Bradley. When a common man analyzes certain _whats_\nfrom out the stream of experience, he understands their distinctness\n_as thus isolated_. But this does not prevent him from equally well\nunderstanding their combination with each other as _originally\nexperienced in the concrete_, or their confluence with new sensible\nexperiences in which they recur as 'the same.' Returning into the\nstream of sensible presentation, nouns and adjectives, and _thats_ and\nabstract _whats_, grow confluent again, and the word 'is' names\nall these experiences of conjunction. Mr. Bradley understands the\nisolation of the abstracts, but to understand the combination is to\nhim impossible.[1] 'To understand a complex _AB_,' he\n[Footnote 1: So far as I catch his state of mind, it is somewhat like\nthis: 'Book,' 'table,' 'on'--how does the existence of these three\nabstract elements result in _this_ book being livingly on _this_\ntable? Why isn't the table on the book? Or why doesn't the 'on'\nconnect itself with another book, or something that is not a table?\nMustn't something _in_ each of the three elements already determine\nthe two others to _it_, so that they do not settle elsewhere or float\nvaguely? Mustn't the whole fact be _prefigured in each part_, and\nexist _de jure_ before it can exist _de facto_? But, if so, in what\ncan the jural existence consist, if not in a spiritual miniature of\nthe whole fact's constitution actuating; every partial factor as its\npurpose? But is this anything but the old metaphysical fallacy of\nlooking behind a fact _in esse_ for the ground of the fact, and\nfinding it in the shape of the very same fact _in posse_? Somewhere we\nmust leave off with a _constitution_ behind which there is nothing.]\nsays, 'I must begin with _A_ or _B_. And beginning, say with _A_, if\nI then merely find _B_, I have either lost _A_, or I have got beside\n_A_, [_the word 'beside' seems here vital, as meaning a conjunction\n'external' and therefore unintelligible_] something else, and in\nneither case have I understood.[1] For my intellect cannot simply\nunite a diversity, nor has it in itself any form or way of\ntogetherness, and you gain nothing if, beside _A_ and _B_, you offer\nme their conjunction in fact. For to my intellect that is no more\nthan another external element. And \"facts,\" once for all, are for my\nintellect not true unless they satisfy it.... The intellect has in its\nnature no principle of mere togetherness' (pp. 570, 572).\nOf course Mr. Bradley has a right to define 'intellect' as the power\nby which we perceive separations but not unions--provided he give\ndue notice to the reader. But why then claim that such a maimed and\namputated power must reign supreme in philosophy, and accuse on its\nbehoof the whole empirical world of irrationality? It is true that he\nelsewhere (p. 568) attributes to the intellect a _proprius motus_ of\ntransition, but says that\n[Footnote 1: Apply this to the case of 'book-on-table'! W.J.]\nwhen he looks for _these_ transitions in the detail of living\nexperience, he 'is unable to verify such a solution' (p. 569).\nYet he never explains what the intellectual transitions would be like\nin case we had them. He only defines them negatively--they are not\nspatial, temporal, predicative, or causal; or qualitatively or\notherwise serial; or in any way relational as we na\u00efvely trace\nrelations, for relations _separate_ terms, and need themselves to be\nhooked on _ad infinitum_. The nearest approach he makes to describing\na truly intellectual transition is where he speaks of _A_ and _B_\nas being 'united, each from its own nature, in a whole which is the\nnature of both alike' (p. 570). But this (which, _pace_ Mr. Bradley,\nseems exquisitely analogous to 'taking a congeries in a lump,' if\nnot to 'swamping') suggests nothing but that _conflux_ which pure\nexperience so abundantly offers, as when 'space,' 'white,' and 'sweet'\nare confluent in a 'lump of sugar,' or kinesthetic, dermal, and\noptical sensations confluent in 'my hand.'[1] All that I can verify\nin the transitions which Mr. Bradley's intellect desiderates as\nits _proprius motus_ is a reminiscence of these and other sensible\nconjunctions (especially space-conjunctions),\n[Footnote 1: How meaningless is the contention that in such wholes\n(or in 'book-on-table,' 'watch-in-pocket,' etc.) the relation is an\nadditional entity _between_ the terms, needing itself to be related\nagain to each! Both Bradley (_Appearance and Reality_, pp. 32-33) and\nRoyce (_The World and the Individual_, i, 128) lovingly repeat this\npiece of profundity.]\nbut a reminiscence so vague that its originals are not recognized.\nBradley, in short, repeats the fable of the dog, the bone, and its\nimage in the water. With a world of particulars, given in loveliest\nunion, in conjunction definitely various, and variously definite,\nthe 'how' of which you 'understand' as soon as you see the fact of\nthem,[1] for there is no how except the constitution of the fact as\ngiven; with all this given him, I say, in pure experience, he asks for\nsome ineffable union in the abstract instead, which, if he gained\nit, would only be a duplicate of what he has already in his full\npossession. Surely he abuses the privilege which society grants to all\nof us philosophers, of being puzzle-headed.\nPolemic writing like this is odious; but with absolutism in possession\nin so many quarters, omission to defend my radical empiricism against\nits best known champion would count as either superficiality or\ninability. I have to conclude that its dialectic has not invalidated\nin the least degree the usual conjunctions by which the world, as\nexperienced, hangs so variously together. In particular it leaves an\nempirical theory of knowledge intact, and lets us continue to believe\nwith common sense that one object _may_ be known, if we have any\nground for thinking that it _is_ known, to many knowers.\n[Footnote 1: The 'why' and the 'whence' are entirely other questions,\nnot under discussion, as I understand Mr. Bradley. Not how experience\ngets itself born, but how it can be what it is after it is born, is\nthe puzzle.]\nAPPENDIX B\nTHE EXPERIENCE OF ACTIVITY[1]\n... Mr. Bradley calls the question of activity a scandal to\nphilosophy, and if one turns to the current literature of the\nsubject--his own writings included--one easily gathers what he means.\nThe opponents cannot even understand one another. Mr. Bradley says to\nMr. Ward: 'I do not care what your oracle is, and your preposterous\npsychology may here be gospel if you please; ... but if the revelation\ndoes contain a meaning, I will commit myself to this: either the\noracle is so confused that its signification is not discoverable,\nor, upon the other hand, if it can be pinned down to any definite\nstatement, then that statement will be false.'[2] Mr. Ward in turn\nsays of Mr. Bradley: 'I cannot even imagine the state of mind to which\nhis description applies.... It reads like an unintentional travesty of\nHerbartian Psychology by one who has tried to improve upon it without\nbeing at the pains to master it.' M\u00fcnsterberg excludes a view opposed\nto his own by saying that with any one who holds it a _verst\u00e4ndigung_\nwith him is '_grunds\u00e4tzlich ausgeschlossen_'; and Royce,\n[Footnote 1: President's Address before the American Psychological\nAssociation, December, 1904. Reprinted from the _Psychological\nReview_, vol. xii, 1905, with slight verbal revision.]\n[Footnote 2: _Appearance and Reality_, p. 117. Obviously written _at_\nWard, though Ward's name is not mentioned.]\nin a review of Stout,[1] hauls him over the coals at great length for\ndefending 'efficacy' in a way which I, for one, never gathered from\nreading him, and which I have heard Stout himself say was quite\nforeign to the intention of his text.\nIn these discussions distinct questions are habitually jumbled and\ndifferent points of view are talked of _durcheinander_.\n(1) There is a psychological question: Have we perceptions of\nactivity? and if so, what are they like, and when and where do we have\nthem?\n(2) There is a metaphysical question: Is there a _fact_ of activity?\nand if so, what idea must we frame of it? What is it like? and what\ndoes it do, if it does anything? And finally there is a logical\nquestion:\n(3) Whence do we _know_ activity? By our own feelings of it solely? or\nby some other source of information? Throughout page after page of the\nliterature one knows not which of these questions is before one; and\nmere description of the surface-show of experience is proffered as if\nit implicitly answered every one of them. No one of the disputants,\nmoreover, tries to show what pragmatic consequences his own view\nwould carry, or what assignable particular differences in any one's\nexperience it would make if his adversary's were triumphant.\n[Footnote 1: _Mind_, N.S., VI, 379.]\nIt seems to me that if radical empiricism be good for anything, it\nought, with its pragmatic method and its principle of pure experience,\nto be able to avoid such tangles, or at least to simplify them\nsomewhat. The pragmatic method starts from the postulate that there\nis no difference of truth that doesn't make a difference of fact\nsomewhere; and it seeks to determine the meaning of all differences of\nopinion by making the discussion hinge as soon as possible upon some\npractical or particular issue. The principle of pure experience is\nalso a methodical postulate. Nothing shall be admitted as fact, it\nsays, except what can be experienced at some definite time by some\nexperient; and for every feature of fact ever so experienced, a\ndefinite place must be found somewhere in the final system of reality.\nIn other words: Everything real must be experienceable somewhere, and\nevery kind of thing experienced must somewhere be real.\nArmed with these rules of method, let us see what face the problems of\nactivity present to us.\nBy the principle of pure experience, either the word 'activity' must\nhave no meaning at all, or else the original type and model of what\nit means must lie in some concrete kind of experience that can be\ndefinitely pointed out. Whatever ulterior judgments we may eventually\ncome to make regarding activity, _that sort_ of thing will be what the\njudgments are about. The first step to take, then, is to ask where in\nthe stream of experience we seem to find what we speak of as activity.\nWhat we are to think of the activity thus found will be a later\nquestion.\nNow it is obvious that we are tempted to affirm activity wherever\nwe find anything _going on_. Taken in the broadest sense, any\napprehension of something _doing_, is an experience of activity. Were\nour world describable only by the words 'nothing happening,' 'nothing\nchanging,' 'nothing doing,' we should unquestionably call it an\n'inactive' world. Bare activity, then, as we may call it, means the\nbare fact of event or change. 'Change taking place' is a unique\ncontent of experience, one of those 'conjunctive' objects which\nradical empiricism seeks so earnestly to rehabilitate and preserve.\nThe sense of activity is thus in the broadest and vaguest way\nsynonymous with the sense of 'life.' We should feel our own subjective\nlife at least, even in noticing and proclaiming an otherwise inactive\nworld. Our own reaction on its monotony would be the one thing\nexperienced there in the form of something coming to pass.\nThis seems to be what certain writers have in mind when they insist\nthat for an experient to be at all is to be active. It seems to\njustify, or at any rate to explain, Mr. Ward's expression that we\n_are_ only as we are active,[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Naturalism and Agnosticism_, vol. ii, p. 245. One thinks\nnaturally of the peripatetic _actus primus_ and _actus secundus_\nhere.]\nfor we _are_ only as experients; and it rules out Mr. Bradley's\ncontention that 'there is no original experience of anything like\nactivity.' What we ought to say about activities thus simply given,\nwhose they are, what they effect, or whether indeed they effect\nanything at all--these are later questions, to be answered only when\nthe field of experience is enlarged.\nBare activity would thus be predicable, though there were no definite\ndirection, no actor, and no aim. Mere restless zigzag movement, or a\nwild _ideenflucht_, or _rhapsodie der wahrnehmungen_, as Kant would\nsay, would constitute an active as distinguished from an inactive\nworld.\nBut in this actual world of ours, as it is given, a part at least of\nthe activity comes with definite direction; it comes with desire\nand sense of goal; it comes complicated with resistances which it\novercomes or succumbs to, and with the efforts which the feeling of\nresistance so often provokes; and it is in complex experiences like\nthese that the notions of distinct agents, and of passivity as opposed\nto activity arise. Here also the notion of causal efficacy comes\nto birth. Perhaps the most elaborate work ever done in descriptive\npsychology has been the analysis by various recent writers of the more\ncomplex activity-situations. In their descriptions, exquisitely subtle\nsome of them,[1] the activity appears as the _gestalt-qualit\u00e4t_\n[Footnote 1: Their existence forms a curious commentary on Professor\nMunsterberg's dogma that will-attitudes are not describable. He\nhimself has contributed in a superior way to their description, both\nin his _Willenshandlung_, and in his _Grundz\u00fcge_, Part II, chap, ix, \u00a7\n7.]\nor the _fundirte inhalt_ (or as whatever else you may please to call\nthe conjunctive form) which the content falls into when we experience\nit in the ways which the describers set forth. Those factors in those\nrelations are what we _mean_ by activity-situations; and to the\npossible enumeration and accumulation of their circumstances and\ningredients there would seem to be no natural bound. Every hour of\nhuman life could contribute to the picture gallery; and this is the\nonly fault that one can find with such descriptive industry--where is\nit going to stop? Ought we to listen forever to verbal pictures of\nwhat we have already in concrete form in our own breasts?[1]\nThey never take us off the superficial plane. We knew the facts\nalready--less spread out and separated, to be sure--but we knew them\nstill. We always felt our own activity, for example, as 'the expansion\nof an idea with which our Self is identified, against an obstacle';\nand the following out of such a definition through a multitude of\ncases elaborates the obvious so as to be little more than an exercise\nin synonymic speech.\nAll the descriptions have to trace familiar outlines, and to use\nfamiliar terms. The activity is, for example,\n[Footnote 1: I ought myself to cry _peccavi_, having been a voluminous\nsinner in my own chapter on the will.]\nattributed either to a physical or to a mental agent, and is either\naimless or directed. If directed, it shows tendency. The tendency may\nor may not be resisted. If not, we call the activity immanent, as when\na body moves in empty space by its momentum, or our thoughts wander at\ntheir own sweet will. If resistance is met, _its_ agent complicates\nthe situation. If now, in spite of resistance, the original tendency\ncontinues, effort makes its appearance, and along with effort, strain\nor squeeze. Will, in the narrower sense of the word, then comes upon\nthe scene, whenever, along with the tendency, the strain and squeeze\nare sustained. But the resistance may be great enough to check the\ntendency, or even to reverse its path. In that case, we (if 'we' were\nthe original agents or subjects of the tendency) are overpowered.\nThe phenomenon turns into one of tension simply, or of necessity\nsuccumbed--to, according as the opposing power is only equal, or is\nsuperior to ourselves.\nWhosoever describes an experience in such terms as these, describes an\nexperience _of_ activity. If the word have any meaning, it must denote\nwhat there is found. _There_ is complete activity in its original and\nfirst intention. What it is 'known-as' is what there appears. The\nexperiencer of such a situation possesses all that the idea contains.\nHe feels the tendency, the obstacle, the will, the strain, the\ntriumph, or the passive giving up, just as he feels the time, the\nspace, the swiftness or intensity, the movement, the weight and\ncolor, the pain and pleasure, the complexity, or whatever remaining\ncharacters the situation may involve. He goes through all that ever\ncan be imagined where activity is supposed. If we suppose activities\nto go on outside of our experience, it is in forms like these that we\nmust suppose them, or else give them some other name; for the word\n'activity' has no imaginable content whatever save these experiences\nof process, obstruction, striving, strain, or release, ultimate\n_qualia_ as they are of the life given us to be known.\nWere this the end of the matter, one might think that whenever we had\nsuccessfully lived through an activity-situation we should have to be\npermitted, without provoking contradiction, to say that we had\nbeen really active, that we had met real resistance and had really\nprevailed. Lotze somewhere says that to be an entity all that is\nnecessary is to _gelten_ as an entity, to operate, or be felt,\nexperienced, recognized, or in any way realized, as such. In our\nactivity-experiences the activity assuredly fulfils Lotze's demand.\nIt makes itself _gelten_. It is witnessed at its work. No matter what\nactivities there may really be in this extraordinary universe of ours,\nit is impossible for us to conceive of any one of them being either\nlived through or authentically known otherwise than in this dramatic\nshape of something sustaining a felt purpose against felt obstacles\nand overcoming or being overcome. What 'sustaining' means here is\nclear to any one who has lived through the experience, but to no one\nelse; just as 'loud,' 'red,' 'sweet,' mean something only to beings\nwith ears, eyes, and tongues. The _percipi_ in these originals of\nexperience is the _esse_; the curtain is the picture. If there is\nanything hiding in the background, it ought not to be called activity,\nbut should get itself another name.\nThis seems so obviously true that one might well experience\nastonishment at finding so many of the ablest writers on the subject\nflatly denying that the activity we live through in these situations\nis real. Merely to feel active is not to be active, in their sight.\nThe agents that appear in the experience are not real agents, the\nresistances do not really resist, the effects that appear are not\nreally effects at all.[1] It is evident from this that\n[Footnote 1: _Verborum grati\u00e2_:'The feeling of activity is not able,\nqu\u00e2 feeling, to tell us anything about activity' (Loveday: _Mind_,\nN.S., X., 403); 'A sensation or feeling or sense of activity ... is\nnot, looked at in another way, a feeling of activity at all. It is a\nmere sensation shut up within which you could by no reflection get the\nidea of activity.... Whether this experience is or is not later on a\ncharacter essential to our perception and our idea of activity, it, as\nit comes first, is not in itself an experience of activity at all. It,\nas it comes first, is only so for extraneous reasons and only so for\nan outside observer' (Bradley, _Appearance and Reality_, 2d edition,\np. 605); 'In dem t\u00e4tigkeitsgef\u00fchle leigt an sich nicht der\ngeringste beweis f\u00fcr das vorhandensein einer psychischen t\u00e4tigkeit'\n(M\u00fcnsterberg: _Grundz\u00fcge_, etc., p. 67). I could multiply similar\nquotations, and would have introduced some of them into my text to\nmake it more concrete, save that the mingling of different points of\nview in most of these author's discussions (not in M\u00fcnsterberg's) make\nit impossible to disentangle exactly what they mean. I am sure in any\ncase to be accused of misrepresenting them totally, even in this note,\nby omission of the context, so the less I name names and the more\nI stick to abstract characterization of a merely possible style of\nopinion, the safer it will be. And apropos of misunderstandings, I may\nadd to this note a complaint on my own account. Professor Stout, in\nthe excellent chapter on 'Mental Activity,' in vol. i of his _Analytic\nPsychology_, takes me to task for identifying spiritual activity with\ncertain muscular feelings, and gives quotations to bear him out. They\nare from certain paragraphs on 'the Self,' in which my attempt was to\nshow what the central nucleus of the activities that we call 'ours'\nis. I found it in certain intracephalic movements which we habitually\noppose, as 'subjective,' to the activities of the transcorporeal\nworld. I sought to show that there is no direct evidence that we feel\nthe activity of an inner spiritual agent as such (I should now say the\nactivity of 'consciousness' as such, see my paper 'Does consciousness\nexist?' in the _Journal of Philosophy_, vol. i, p. 477). There are, in\nfact, three distinguishable 'activities' in the field of discussion:\nthe elementary activity involved in the mere _that_ of experience, in\nthe fact that _something_ is going on, and the farther specification\nof this _something_ into two _whats_, an activity felt as 'ours,' and\nan activity ascribed to objects. Stout, as I apprehend him, identifies\n'our' activity with that of the total experience-process, and when I\ncircumscribe it as a part thereof, accuses me of treating it as a sort\nof external appendage to itself (pp. 162-163), as if I 'separated the\nactivity from the process which is active.' But all the processes in\nquestion are active, and their activity is inseparable from their\nbeing. My book raised only the question of _which_ activity deserved\nthe name of 'ours.' So far as we are 'persons,' and contrasted and\nopposed to an 'environment,' movements in our body figure as our\nactivities; and I am unable to find any other activities that are ours\nin this strictly personal sense. There is a wider sense in which\nthe whole 'choir of heaven and furniture of the earth,' and their\nactivities, are ours, for they are our 'objects.' But 'we' are here\nonly another name for the total process of experience, another name\nfor all that is, in fact; and I was dealing with the personal and\nindividualized self exclusively in the passages with which Professor\nStout finds fault.\nThe individualized self, which I believe to be the only thing properly\ncalled self, is a part of the content of the world experienced. The\nworld experienced (otherwise called the 'field of consciousness')\ncomes at all times with our body as its centre, centre of vision,\ncentre of action, centre of interest. Where the body is is 'here';\nwhen the body acts is 'now'; what the body touches is 'this'; all\nother things are 'there' and 'then' and 'that.' These words of\nemphasized position imply a systematization of things with reference\nto a focus of action and interest which lies in the body; and the\nsystematization is now so instinctive (was it ever not so?) that no\ndeveloped or active experience exists for us at all except in that\nordered form. So far as 'thoughts' and 'feelings' can be active, their\nactivity terminates in the activity of the body, and only through\nfirst arousing its activities can they begin to change those of\nthe rest of the world. The body is the storm centre, the origin\nof co-ordinates, the constant place of stress in all that\nexperience-train. Everything circles round it, and is felt from its\npoint of view. The word 'I,' then, is primarily a noun of position,\njust like 'this' and 'here.' Activities attached to 'this' position\nhave prerogative emphasis, and, if activities have feelings, must be\nfelt in a peculiar way. The word 'my' designates the kind of emphasis.\nI see no inconsistency whatever in defending, on the one hand, 'my'\nactivities as unique and opposed to those of outer nature, and, on the\nother hand, in affirming, after introspection, that they consist in\nmovements in the head. The 'my' of them is the emphasis, the feeling\nof perspective-interest in which they are dyed.]\nmere descriptive analysis of any one of our activity-experiences is\nnot the whole story, that there is something still to tell _about_\nthem that has led such able writers to conceive of a _Simon-pure_\nactivity, of an activity _an sich_, that does, and doesn't merely\nappear to us to do, and compared with whose real doing all this\nphenomenal activity is but a specious sham.\nThe metaphysical question opens here; and I think that the state of\nmind of one possessed by it is often something like this: 'It is\nall very well,' we may imagine him saying, 'to talk about certain\nexperience-series taking on the form of feelings of activity, just as\nthey might take on musical or geometric forms. Suppose that they do\nso; suppose that what we feel is a will to stand a strain. Does our\nfeeling do more than _record_ the fact that the strain is sustained?\nThe _real_ activity, meanwhile, is the _doing_ of the fact; and what\nis the doing made of before the record is made? What in the will\n_enables_ it to act thus? And these trains of experience themselves,\nin which activities appear, what makes them _go_ at all? Does the\nactivity in one bit of experience bring the next bit into being? As an\nempiricist you cannot say so, for you have just declared activity\nto be only a kind of synthetic object, or conjunctive relation\nexperienced between bits of experience already made. But what made\nthem at all? What propels experience _\u00fcberhaupt_ into being? _There_\nis the activity that _operates_; the activity _felt_ is only its\nsuperficial sign.'\nTo the metaphysical question, popped upon us in this way, I must pay\nserious attention ere I end my remarks, but, before doing so, let me\nshow that without leaving the immediate reticulations of experience,\nor asking what makes activity itself act, we still find the\ndistinction between less real and more real activities forced upon us,\nand are driven to much soul-searching on the purely phenomenal plane.\nWe must not forget, namely, in talking of the ultimate character of\nour activity-experiences, that each of them is but a portion of a\nwider world, one link in the vast chain of processes of experience\nout of which history is made. Each partial process, to him who lives\nthrough it, defines itself by its origin and its goal; but to an\nobserver with a wider mind-span who should live outside of it,\nthat goal would appear but as a provisional halting-place, and the\nsubjectively felt activity would be seen to continue into objective\nactivities that led far beyond. We thus acquire a habit, in discussing\nactivity-experiences, of defining them by their relation to something\nmore. If an experience be one of narrow span, it will be mistaken as\nto what activity it is and whose. You think that _you_ are acting\nwhile you are only obeying some one's push. You think you are doing\n_this_, but you are doing something of which you do not dream. For\ninstance, you think you are but drinking this glass; but you are\nreally creating the liver-cirrhosis that will end your days. You think\nyou are just driving this bargain, but, as Stevenson says somewhere,\nyou are laying down a link in the policy of mankind.\nGenerally speaking, the onlooker, with his wider field of vision,\nregards the _ultimate outcome_ of an activity as what it is more\nreally doing; and _the most previous agent_ ascertainable, being the\nfirst source of action, he regards as the most real agent in the\nfield. The others but transmit that agent's impulse; on him we put\nresponsibility; we name him when one asks us, 'Who's to blame?'\nBut the most previous agents ascertainable, instead of being of longer\nspan, are often of much shorter span than the activity in view.\nBrain-cells are our best example. My brain-cells are believed to\nexcite each other from next to next (by contiguous transmission of\nkatabolic alteration, let us say), and to have been doing so long\nbefore this present stretch of lecturing-activity on my part began.\nIf any one cell-group stops its activity, the lecturing will cease or\nshow disorder of form. _Cessante causa, cessat et effectus_--does not\nthis look as if the short-span brain activities were the more real\nactivities, and the lecturing activities on my part only their\neffects? Moreover, as Hume so clearly pointed out, in my mental\nactivity-situation the words physically to be uttered are represented\nas the activity's immediate goal. These words, however, cannot be\nuttered without intermediate physical processes in the bulb and vagi\nnerves, which processes nevertheless fail to figure in the mental\nactivity-series at all. That series, therefore, since it leaves out\nvitally real steps of action, cannot represent the real activities. It\nis something purely subjective; the _facts_ of activity are elsewhere.\nThey are something far more interstitial, so to speak, than what my\nfeelings record.\nThe _real_ facts of activity that have in point of fact been\nsystematically pleaded for by philosophers have, so far as my\ninformation goes, been of three principal types.\nThe first type takes a consciousness of wider time-span than ours to\nbe the vehicle of the more real activity. Its will is the agent, and\nits purpose is the action done.\nThe second type assumes that 'ideas' struggling with one another are\nthe agents, and that the prevalence of one set of them is the action.\nThe third type believes that nerve-cells are the agents, and that\nresultant motor discharges are the acts achieved.\nNow if we must de-realize our immediately felt activity-situations for\nthe benefit of either of these types of substitute, we ought to know\nwhat the substitution practically involves. _What practical difference\nought it to make if_, instead of saying naively that 'I' am active now\nin delivering this address, I say that _a wider thinker is active_,\nor that _certain ideas are active_, or that _certain nerve-cells are\nactive_, in producing the result?\nThis would be the pragmatic meaning of the three hypotheses. Let us\ntake them in succession in seeking a reply.\nIf we assume a wider thinker, it is evident that his purposes envelop\nmine. I am really lecturing _for_ him; and altho I cannot surely know\nto what end, yet if I take him religiously, I can trust it to be a\ngood end, and willingly connive. I can be happy in thinking that my\nactivity transmits his impulse, and that his ends prolong my own. So\nlong as I take him religiously, in short, he does not de-realize my\nactivities. He tends rather to corroborate the reality of them, so\nlong as I believe both them and him to be good.\nWhen now we turn to ideas, the case is different, inasmuch as ideas\nare supposed by the association psychology to influence each other\nonly from next to next. The 'span' of an idea, or pair of ideas, is\nassumed to be much smaller instead of being larger than that of my\ntotal conscious field. The same results may get worked out in both\ncases, for this address is being given anyhow. But the ideas supposed\nto 'really' work it out had no prevision of the whole of it; and if\nI was lecturing for an absolute thinker in the former case, so,\nby similar reasoning, are my ideas now lecturing for me, that is,\naccomplishing unwittingly a result which I approve and adopt. But,\nwhen this passing lecture is over, there is nothing in the bare notion\nthat ideas have been its agents that would seem to guarantee that my\npresent purposes in lecturing will be prolonged. _I_ may have ulterior\ndevelopments in view; but there is no certainty that my ideas as such\nwill wish to, or be able to, work them out.\nThe like is true if nerve-cells be the agents. The activity of a\nnerve-cell must be conceived of as a tendency of exceedingly short\nreach, an 'impulse' barely spanning the way to the next cell--for\nsurely that amount of actual 'process' must be 'experienced' by the\ncells if what happens between them is to deserve the name of activity\nat all. But here again the gross resultant, as _I_ perceive it, is\nindifferent to the agents, and neither wished or willed or foreseen.\nTheir being agents now congruous with my will gives me no guarantee\nthat like results will recur again from their activity. In point of\nfact, all sorts of other results do occur. My mistakes, impotencies,\nperversions, mental obstructions, and frustrations generally, are also\nresults of the activity of cells. Altho these are letting me lecture\nnow, on other occasions they make me do things that I would willingly\nnot do.\nThe question _Whose is the real activity?_ is thus tantamount to the\nquestion _What will be the actual results?_ Its interest is dramatic;\nhow will things work out? If the agents are of one sort, one way; if\nof another sort, they may work out very differently. The pragmatic\nmeaning of the various alternatives, in short, is great. It makes more\nthan a merely verbal difference which opinion we take up.\nYou see it is the old dispute come back! Materialism and teleology;\nelementary short-span actions summing themselves 'blindly,' or far\nforeseen ideals coming with effort into act.\nNa\u00efvely we believe, and humanly and dramatically we like to believe,\nthat activities both of wider and of narrower span are at work in life\ntogether, that both are real, and that the long-span tendencies yoke\nthe others in their service, encouraging them in the right direction,\nand damping them when they tend in other ways. But how to represent\nclearly the _modus operandi_ of such steering of small tendencies\nby large ones is a problem which metaphysical thinkers will have to\nruminate upon for many years to come. Even if such control should\neventually grow clearly picturable, the question how far it is\nsuccessfully exerted in this actual world can be answered only by\ninvestigating the details of fact. No philosophic knowledge of the\ngeneral nature and constitution of tendencies, or of the relation\nof larger to smaller ones, can help us to predict which of all the\nvarious competing tendencies that interest us in this universe are\nlikeliest to prevail. We know as an empirical fact that far-seeing\ntendencies often carry out their purpose, but we know also that they\nare often defeated by the failure of some contemptibly small process\non which success depends. A little thrombus in a statesman's meningeal\nartery will throw an empire out of gear. Therefore I cannot even hint\nat any solution of the pragmatic issue. I have only wished to show you\nthat that issue is what gives the real interest to all inquiries into\nwhat kinds of activity may be real. Are the forces that really act in\nthe world more foreseeing or more blind? As between 'our' activities\nas 'we' experience them, and those of our ideas, or of our\nbrain-cells, the issue is well defined.\nI said awhile back (p. 381) that I should return to the 'metaphysical'\nquestion before ending; so, with a few words about that, I will now\nclose my remarks.\nIn whatever form we hear this question propounded, I think that it\nalways arises from two things, a belief that _causality_ must be\nexerted in activity, and a wonder as to how causality is made. If we\ntake an activity-situation at its face-value, it seems as if we caught\n_in flagrante delicto_ the very power that makes facts come and be. I\nnow am eagerly striving, for example, to get this truth which I seem\nhalf to perceive, into words which shall make it show more clearly. If\nthe words come, it will seem as if the striving itself had drawn or\npulled them into actuality out from the state of merely possible being\nin which they were. How is this feat performed? How does the pulling\n_pull_? How do I get my hold on words not yet existent, and when they\ncome, by what means have I _made_ them come? Really it is the problem\nof creation; for in the end the question is: How do I make them _be?_\nReal activities are those that really make things be, without which\nthe things are not, and with which they are there. Activity, so far as\nwe merely feel it, on the other hand, is only an impression of ours,\nit may be maintained; and an impression is, for all this way of\nthinking, only a shadow of another fact.\nArrived at this point, I can do little more than indicate the\nprinciples on which, as it seems to me, a radically empirical\nphilosophy is obliged to rely in handling such a dispute.\nIf there _be_ real creative activities in being, radical empiricism\nmust say, somewhere they must be immediately lived. Somewhere the\n_that_ of efficacious causing and the _what_ of it must be experienced\nin one, just as the what and the that of 'cold' are experienced in one\nwhenever a man has the sensation of cold here and now. It boots not to\nsay that our sensations are fallible. They are indeed; but to see the\nthermometer contradict us when we say 'it is cold' does not abolish\ncold as a specific nature from the universe. Cold is in the arctic\ncircle if not here. Even so, to feel that our train is moving when the\ntrain beside our window moves, to see the moon through a telescope\ncome twice as near, or to see two pictures as one solid when we look\nthrough a stereoscope at them, leaves motion, nearness, and solidity\nstill in being--if not here, yet each in its proper seat elsewhere.\nAnd wherever the seat of real causality _is_, as ultimately known 'for\ntrue' (in nerve-processes, if you will, that cause our feelings of\nactivity as well as the movements which these seem to prompt), a\nphilosophy of pure experience can consider the real causation as no\nother _nature_ of thing than that which even in our most erroneous\nexperiences appears to be at work. Exactly what appears there is what\nwe _mean_ by working, tho we may later come to learn that working was\nnot exactly _there_. Sustaining, persevering, striving, paying with\neffort as we go, hanging on, and finally achieving our intention--this\n_is_ action, this _is_ effectuation in the only shape in which, by\na pure experience-philosophy, the whereabouts of it anywhere can be\ndiscussed. Here is creation in its first intention, here is causality\nat work.[1] To treat this offhand as the bare illusory\n[Footnote 1: Let me not be told that this contradicts a former article\nof mine, 'Does consciousness exist?' in the _Journal of Philosophy_\nfor September 1, 1904 (see especially page 489), in which it was said\nthat while 'thoughts' and 'things' have the same natures, the natures\nwork 'energetically' on each other in the things (fire burns, water\nwets, etc.), but not in the thoughts. Mental activity-trains are\ncomposed of thoughts, yet their members do work on each other: they\ncheck, sustain, and introduce. They do so when the activity is merely\nassociational as well as when effort is there. But, and this is my\nreply, they do so by other parts of their nature than those that\nenergize physically. One thought in every developed activity-series is\na desire or thought of purpose, and all the other thoughts acquire a\nfeeling tone from their relation of harmony or oppugnancy to this.\nThe interplay of these secondary tones (among which 'interest,'\n'difficulty,' and 'effort' figure) runs the drama in the mental\nseries. In what we term the physical drama these qualities play\nabsolutely no part. The subject needs careful working out; but I can\nsee no inconsistency.]\nsurface of a world whose real causality is an unimaginable ontological\nprinciple hidden in the cubic deeps, is, for the more empirical way of\nthinking, only animism in another shape. You explain your given fact\nby your 'principle,' but the principle itself, when you look clearly\nat it, turns out to be nothing but a previous little spiritual copy\nof the fact. Away from that one and only kind of fact your mind,\nconsidering causality, can never get.[1]\n[Footnote 1: I have found myself more than once accused in print of\nbeing the assertor of a metaphysical principle of activity. Since\nliterary misunderstandings retard the settlement of problems, I should\nlike to say that such an interpretation of the pages I have published\non effort and on will is absolutely foreign to what I meant to\nexpress. I owe all my doctrines on this subject to Renouvier; and\nRenouvier, as I understand him, is (or at any rate then was) an out\nand out phenomenist, a denier of 'forces' in the most strenuous\nsense. Single clauses in my writing, or sentences read out of their\nconnexion, may possibly have been compatible with a transphenomenal\nprinciple of energy; but I defy any one to show a single sentence\nwhich, taken with its context, should be naturally held to advocate\nthat view. The misinterpretation probably arose at first from my\nhaving defended (after Renouvier) the indeterminism of our efforts.\n'Free will' was supposed by my critics to involve a supernatural\nagent. As a matter of plain history, the only 'free will' I have\never thought of defending is the character of novelty in fresh\nactivity-situations. If an activity-process is the form of a whole\n'field of consciousness,' and if each field of consciousness is not\nonly in its totality unique (as is now commonly admitted), but has\nits elements unique (since in that situation they are all dyed in\nthe total), then novelty is perpetually entering the world and what\nhappens there is not pure _repetition_, as the dogma of the literal\nuniformity of nature requires. Activity-situations come, in short,\neach with an original touch. A 'principle' of free will, if there were\none, would doubtless manifest itself in such phenomena, but I never\nsaw, nor do I now see, what the principle could do except rehearse the\nphenomenon beforehand, or why it ever should be invoked.]\nI conclude, then, that real effectual causation as an ultimate nature,\nas a 'category,' if you like, of reality, is _just what we feel it\nto be_, just that kind of conjunction which our own activity-series\nreveal. We have the whole butt and being of it in our hands; and the\nhealthy thing for philosophy is to leave off grubbing underground for\nwhat effects effectuation, or what makes action act, and to try to\nsolve the concrete questions of where effectuation in this world is\nlocated, of which things are the true causal agents there, and of what\nthe more remote effects consist.\nFrom this point of view the greater sublimity traditionally attributed\nto the metaphysical inquiry, the grubbing inquiry, entirely\ndisappears. If we could know what causation really and\ntranscendentally is in itself, the only _use_ of the knowledge would\nbe to help us to recognize an actual cause when we had one, and so to\ntrack the future course of operations more intelligently out. The mere\nabstract inquiry into causation's hidden nature is not more sublime\nthan any other inquiry equally abstract. Causation inhabits no more\nsublime level than anything else. It lives, apparently, in the dirt of\nthe world as well as in the absolute, or in man's unconquerable mind.\nThe worth and interest of the world consists not in its elements,\nbe these elements things, or be they the conjunctions of things; it\nexists rather in the dramatic outcome of the whole process, and in the\nmeaning of the succession stages which the elements work out.\nMy colleague and master, Josiah Royce, in a page of his review of\nStout's _Analytic Psychology_, in _Mind_ for 1897, has some fine words\non this point with which I cordially agree. I cannot agree with his\nseparating the notion of efficacy from that of activity altogether\n(this I understand to be one contention of his), for activities are\nefficacious whenever they are real activities at all. But the inner\nnature both of efficacy and of activity are superficial problems, I\nunderstand Royce to say; and the only point for us in solving them\nwould be their possible use in helping us to solve the far deeper\nproblem of the course and meaning of the world of life. Life, says\nour colleague, is full of significance, of meaning, of success and of\ndefeat, of hoping and of striving, of longing, of desire, and of inner\nvalue. It is a total presence that embodies worth. To live our own\nlives better in this presence is the true reason why we wish to know\nthe elements of things; so even we psychologists must end on this\npragmatic note.\nThe urgent problems of activity are thus more concrete. They all\nare problems of the true relation of longer-span to shorter-span\nactivities. When, for example, a number of 'ideas' (to use the name\ntraditional in psychology) grow confluent in a larger field of\nconsciousness, do the smaller activities still coexist with the wider\nactivities then experienced by the conscious subject? And, if so, do\nthe wide activities accompany the narrow ones inertly, or do they\nexert control? Or do they perhaps utterly supplant and replace them\nand short-circuit their effects? Again, when a mental activity-process\nand a brain-cell series of activities both terminate in the same\nmuscular movement, does the mental process steer the neural processes\nor not? Or, on the other hand, does it independently short-circuit\ntheir effects? Such are the questions that we must begin with. But so\nfar am I from suggesting any definitive answer to such questions,\nthat I hardly yet can put them clearly. They lead, however, into that\nregion of panpsychic and ontologic speculation of which Professors\nBergson and Strong have lately enlarged the literature in so able and\ninteresting a way. The results of these authors seem in many respects\ndissimilar, and I understand them as yet but imperfectly; but I cannot\nhelp suspecting that the direction of their work is very promising,\nand that they have the hunter's instinct for the fruitful trails.\nAPPENDIX C\nON THE NOTION OF REALITY AS CHANGING\nIn my _Principles of Psychology_ (vol. ii, p. 646) I gave the name of\nthe 'axiom of skipped intermediaries and transferred relations' to a\nserial principle of which the foundation of logic, the _dictum de omni\net nullo_ (or, as I expressed it, the rule that what is of a kind is\nof that kind's kind), is the most familiar instance. More than the\nmore is more than the less, equals of equals are equal, sames of the\nsame are the same, the cause of a cause is the cause of its effects,\nare other examples of this serial law. Altho it applies infallibly\nand without restriction throughout certain abstract series, where the\n'sames,' 'causes,' etc., spoken of, are 'pure,' and have no properties\nsave their sameness, causality, etc., it cannot be applied offhand to\nconcrete objects with numerous properties and relations, for it is\nhard to trace a straight line of sameness, causation, or whatever it\nmay be, through a series of such objects without swerving into some\n'respect' where the relation, as pursued originally, no longer holds:\nthe objects have so many 'aspects' that we are constantly deflected\nfrom our original direction, and find, we know not why, that we are\nfollowing something different from what we started with. Thus a cat is\nin a sense the same as a mouse-trap, and a mouse-trap the same as a\nbird-cage; but in no valuable or easily intelligible sense is a cat\nthe same as a bird-cage. Commodore Perry was in a sense the cause\nof the new r\u00e9gime in Japan, and the new r\u00e9gime was the cause of the\nrussian Douma; but it would hardly profit us to insist on holding to\nPerry as the cause of the Douma: the terms have grown too remote to\nhave any real or practical relation to each other. In every series of\nreal terms, not only do the terms themselves and their associates\nand environments change, but we change, and their _meaning_ for\nus changes, so that new kinds of sameness and types of causation\ncontinually come into view and appeal to our interest. Our earlier\nlines, having grown irrelevant, are then dropped. The old terms can no\nlonger be substituted nor the relations 'transferred,' because of so\nmany new dimensions into which experience has opened. Instead of a\nstraight line, it now follows a zigzag; and to keep it straight, one\nmust do violence to its spontaneous development. Not that one might\nnot possibly, by careful seeking (tho I doubt it), _find_ some line in\nnature along which terms literally the same, or causes causal in the\nsame way, might be serially strung without limit, if one's interest\nlay in such finding. Within such lines our axioms might hold, causes\nmight cause their effect's effects, etc.; but such lines themselves\nwould, if found, only be partial members of a vast natural network,\nwithin the other lines of which you could not say, in any sense that\na wise man or a sane man would ever think of, in any sense that would\nnot be concretely _silly_, that the principle of skipt intermediaries\nstill held good. In the _practical_ world, the world whose\nsignificances we follow, sames of the same are certainly not sames of\none another; and things constantly cause other things without being\nheld responsible for everything of which those other things are\ncauses.\nProfessor Bergson, believing as he does in a heraclitean 'devenir\nr\u00e9el,' ought, if I rightly understand him, positively to deny that in\nthe actual world the logical axioms hold good without qualification.\nNot only, according to him, do terms change, so that after a certain\ntime the very elements of things are no longer what they were, but\nrelations also change, so as no longer to obtain in the same identical\nway between the new things that have succeeded upon the old ones. If\nthis were really so, then however indefinitely sames might still\nbe substituted for sames in the logical world of nothing but pure\nsameness, in the world of real operations every line of sameness\nactually started and followed up would eventually give out, and cease\nto be traceable any farther. Sames of the same, in such a world, will\nnot always (or rather, in a strict sense will never) be the same\nas one another, for in such a world there _is_ no literal or ideal\nsameness among numerical differents. Nor in such a world will it be\ntrue that the cause of the cause is unreservedly the cause of\nthe effect; for if we follow lines of real causation, instead of\ncontenting ourselves with Hume's and Kant's eviscerated schematism, we\nfind that remoter effects are seldom aimed at by causal intentions,[1]\nthat no one kind of causal activity continues indefinitely, and that\nthe principle of skipt intermediaries can be talked of only _in\nabstracto_.[2]\nVolumes i, ii, and iii of the _Monist_ (1890-1893) contain a number of\narticles by Mr. Charles S. Peirce, articles the originality of which\nhas apparently prevented their making an immediate impression, but\nwhich, if I mistake not, will prove a gold-mine of ideas for thinkers\nof the coming generation. Mr. Peirce's views, tho reached so\ndifferently, are altogether congruous with Bergson's. Both\nphilosophers believe that the appearance of novelty in things is\ngenuine. To an observer standing outside of its generating causes,\nnovelty can appear only as so much 'chance'; to one who stands inside\nit is the expression of 'free creative activity.' Peirce's 'tychism'\nis thus practically synonymous with Bergson's 'devenir r\u00e9el.' The\ncommon objection to admitting novelties is that by jumping abruptly\nin, _ex nihilo_, they shatter the world's rational continuity. Peirce\nmeets this objection by combining his tychism\n[Footnote 1: Compare the douma with what Perry aimed at.]\n[Footnote 2: Compare Appendix B, as to what I mean here by 'real'\ncasual activity.]\nwith an express doctrine of 'synechism' or continuity, the two\ndoctrines merging into the higher synthesis on which he bestows the\nname of 'agapasticism (_loc. cit._, iii, 188), which means exactly the\nsame thing as Bergson's '\u00e9volution cr\u00e9atrice.' Novelty, as empirically\nfound, doesn't arrive by jumps and jolts, it leaks in insensibly, for\nadjacents in experience are always interfused, the smallest real datum\nbeing both a coming and a going, and even numerical distinctness being\nrealized effectively only after a concrete interval has passed. The\nintervals also deflect us from the original paths of direction, and\nall the old identities at last give out, for the fatally continuous\ninfiltration of otherness warps things out of every original rut.\nJust so, in a curve, the same direction is _never_ followed, and the\nconception of it as a myriad-sided polygon falsifies it by\nsupposing it to do so for however short a time. Peirce speaks of an\n'infinitesimal' tendency to diversification. The mathematical notion\nof an infinitesimal contains, in truth, the whole paradox of the same\nand yet the nascent other, of an identity that won't _keep_ except so\nfar as it keeps _failing_, that won't _transfer_, any more than the\nserial relations in question transfer, when you apply them to reality\ninstead of applying them to concepts alone.\nA friend of mine has an idea, which illustrates on such a magnified\nscale the impossibility of tracing the same line through reality, that\nI will mention it here. He thinks that nothing more is needed to make\nhistory 'scientific' than to get the content of any two epochs (say\nthe end of the thirteenth and the end of the nineteenth century)\naccurately defined, then accurately to define the direction of the\nchange that led from the one epoch into the other, and finally to\nprolong the line of that direction into the future. So prolonging the\nline, he thinks, we ought to be able to define the actual state\nof things at any future date we please. We all feel the essential\nunreality of such a conception of 'history' as this; but if such a\nsynechistic pluralism as Peirce, Bergson, and I believe in, be what\nreally exists, every phenomenon of development, even the simplest,\nwould prove equally rebellious to our science should the latter\npretend to give us literally accurate instead of approximate, or\nstatistically generalized, pictures of the development of reality.\nI can give no further account of Mr. Peirce's ideas in this note, but\nI earnestly advise all students of Bergson to compare them with those\nof the french philosopher.\nINDEX\nINDEX TO THE LECTURES\nAbsolute, the, 49, 108-109, 114 ff., 173, 175, 190 ff., 203, 271, 292 ff.,\n311; not the same as God, 111, 134; its rationality, 114 f.; its\nirrationality, 117-129; difficulty of conceiving it, 195.\nAbsolutism, 34, 38, 40, 54, 72 f, 79, 122, 310.

{"text": "DOES 'CONSCIOUSNESS' EXIST?[2]\n'Thoughts' and 'things' are names for two sorts of object, which common\nsense will always find contrasted and will always practically oppose to\neach other. Philosophy, reflecting on the contrast, has varied in the\npast in her explanations of it, and may be expected to vary in the\nfuture. At first, 'spirit and matter,' 'soul and body,' stood for a pair\nof equipollent substances quite on a par in weight and interest. But one\nday Kant undermined the soul and brought in the transcendental ego, and\never since then the bipolar relation has been very much off its balance.\nThe transcendental ego seems nowadays in rationalist quarters to stand\nfor everything, in empiricist quarters for almost nothing. In the hands\nof such writers as Schuppe, Rehmke, Natorp, M\u00fcnsterberg--at any rate in\nhis earlier writings, Schubert-Soldern and others, the spiritual\nprinciple attenuates itself to a thoroughly ghostly condition, being\nonly a name for the fact that the 'content' of experience _is known_. It\nloses personal form and activity--these passing over to the content--and\nbecomes a bare _Bewusstheit_ or _Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt_, of which in its\nown right absolutely nothing can be said.\nI believe that 'consciousness,' when once it has evaporated to this\nestate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point of disappearing altogether.\nIt is the name of a nonentity, and has no right to a place among first\nprinciples. Those who still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo, the\nfaint rumor left behind by the disappearing 'soul' upon the air of\nphilosophy. During the past year, I have read a number of articles whose\nauthors seemed just on the point of abandoning the notion of\nconsciousness,[3] and substituting for it that of an absolute experience\nnot due to two factors. But they were not quite radical enough, not\nquite daring enough in their negations. For twenty years past I have\nmistrusted 'consciousness' as an entity; for seven or eight years past I\nhave suggested its non-existence to my students, and tried to give them\nits pragmatic equivalent in realities of experience. It seems to me that\nthe hour is ripe for it to be openly and universally discarded.\nTo deny plumply that 'consciousness' exists seems so absurd on the face\nof it--for undeniably 'thoughts' do exist--that I fear some readers will\nfollow me no farther. Let me then immediately explain that I mean only\nto deny that the word stands for an entity, but to insist most\nemphatically that it does stand for a function. There is, I mean, no\naboriginal stuff or quality of being,[4] contrasted with that of which\nmaterial objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are made;\nbut there is a function in experience which thoughts perform, and for\nthe performance of which this quality of being is invoked. That\nfunction is _knowing_. 'Consciousness' is supposed necessary to explain\nthe fact that things not only are, but get reported, are known. Whoever\nblots out the notion of consciousness from his list of first principles\nmust still provide in some way for that function's being carried on.\nI\nMy thesis is that if we start with the supposition that there is only\none primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything\nis composed, and if we call that stuff 'pure experience,' then knowing\ncan easily be explained as a particular sort of relation towards one\nanother into which portions of pure experience may enter. The relation\nitself is a part of pure experience; one of its 'terms' becomes the\nsubject or bearer of the knowledge, the knower,[5] the other becomes the\nobject known. This will need much explanation before it can be\nunderstood. The best way to get it understood is to contrast it with the\nalternative view; and for that we may take the recentest alternative,\nthat in which the evaporation of the definite soul-substance has\nproceeded as far as it can go without being yet complete. If neo-Kantism\nhas expelled earlier forms of dualism, we shall have expelled all forms\nif we are able to expel neo-Kantism in its turn.\nFor the thinkers I call neo-Kantian, the word consciousness to-day does\nno more than signalize the fact that experience is indefeasibly\ndualistic in structure. It means that not subject, not object, but\nobject-plus-subject is the minimum that can actually be. The\nsubject-object distinction meanwhile is entirely different from that\nbetween mind and matter, from that between body and soul. Souls were\ndetachable, had separate destinies; things could happen to them. To\nconsciousness as such nothing can happen, for, timeless itself, it is\nonly a witness of happenings in time, in which it plays no part. It is,\nin a word, but the logical correlative of 'content' in an Experience of\nwhich the peculiarity is that _fact comes to light_ in it, that\n_awareness of content_ takes place. Consciousness as such is entirely\nimpersonal--'self' and its activities belong to the content. To say that\nI am self-conscious, or conscious of putting forth volition, means only\nthat certain contents, for which 'self' and 'effort of will' are the\nnames, are not without witness as they occur.\nThus, for these belated drinkers at the Kantian spring, we should have\nto admit consciousness as an 'epistemological' necessity, even if we had\nno direct evidence of its being there.\nBut in addition to this, we are supposed by almost every one to have an\nimmediate consciousness of consciousness itself. When the world of outer\nfact ceases to be materially present, and we merely recall it in memory,\nor fancy it, the consciousness is believed to stand out and to be felt\nas a kind of impalpable inner flowing, which, once known in this sort of\nexperience, may equally be detected in presentations of the outer world.\n\"The moment we try to fix our attention upon consciousness and to see\n_what_, distinctly, it is,\" says a recent writer, \"it seems to vanish.\nIt seems as if we had before us a mere emptiness. When we try to\nintrospect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue; the other\nelement is as if it were diaphanous. Yet it _can_ be distinguished, if\nwe look attentively enough, and know that there is something to look\nfor.\"[6] \"Consciousness\" (Bewusstheit), says another philosopher, \"is\ninexplicable and hardly describable, yet all conscious experiences have\nthis in common that what we call their content has this peculiar\nreference to a centre for which 'self' is the name, in virtue of which\nreference alone the content is subjectively given, or appears ... While\nin this way consciousness, or reference to a self, is the only thing\nwhich distinguishes a conscious content from any sort of being that\nmight be there with no one conscious of it, yet this only ground of the\ndistinction defies all closer explanations. The existence of\nconsciousness, although it is the fundamental fact of psychology, can\nindeed be laid down as certain, can be brought out by analysis, but can\nneither be defined nor deduced from anything but itself.\"[7]\n'Can be brought out by analysis,' this author says. This supposes that\nthe consciousness is one element, moment, factor--call it what you\nlike--of an experience of essentially dualistic inner constitution, from\nwhich, if you abstract the content, the consciousness will remain\nrevealed to its own eye. Experience, at this rate, would be much like a\npaint of which the world pictures were made. Paint has a dual\nconstitution, involving, as it does, a menstruum[8] (oil, size or what\nnot) and a mass of content in the form of pigment suspended therein. We\ncan get the pure menstruum by letting the pigment settle, and the pure\npigment by pouring off the size or oil. We operate here by physical\nsubtraction; and the usual view is, that by mental subtraction we can\nseparate the two factors of experience in an analogous way--not\nisolating them entirely, but distinguishing them enough to know that\nthey are two.\nII\nNow my contention is exactly the reverse of this. _Experience, I\nbelieve, has no such inner duplicity; and the separation of it into\nconsciousness and content comes, not by way of subtraction, but by way\nof addition_--the addition, to a given concrete piece of it, of other\nsets of experiences, in connection with which severally its use or\nfunction may be of two different kinds. The paint will also serve here\nas an illustration. In a pot in a paint-shop, along with other paints,\nit serves in its entirety as so much saleable matter. Spread on a\ncanvas, with other paints around it, it represents, on the contrary, a\nfeature in a picture and performs a spiritual function. Just so, I\nmaintain, does a given undivided portion of experience, taken in one\ncontext of associates, play the part of a knower, of a state of mind, of\n'consciousness'; while in a different context the same undivided bit of\nexperience plays the part of a thing known, of an objective 'content.'\nIn a word, in one group it figures as a thought, in another group as a\nthing. And, since it can figure in both groups simultaneously we have\nevery right to speak of it as subjective and objective both at once. The\ndualism connoted by such double-barrelled terms as 'experience,'\n'phenomenon,' 'datum,' '_Vorfindung_'--terms which, in philosophy at any\nrate, tend more and more to replace the single-barrelled terms of\n'thought' and 'thing'--that dualism, I say, is still preserved in this\naccount, but reinterpreted, so that, instead of being mysterious and\nelusive, it becomes verifiable and concrete. It is an affair of\nrelations, it falls outside, not inside, the single experience\nconsidered, and can always be particularized and defined.\nThe entering wedge for this more concrete way of understanding the\ndualism was fashioned by Locke when he made the word 'idea' stand\nindifferently for thing and thought, and by Berkeley when he said that\nwhat common sense means by realities is exactly what the philosopher\nmeans by ideas. Neither Locke nor Berkeley thought his truth out into\nperfect clearness, but it seems to me that the conception I am defending\ndoes little more than consistently carry out the 'pragmatic' method\nwhich they were the first to use.\nIf the reader will take his own experiences, he will see what I mean.\nLet him begin with a perceptual experience, the 'presentation,' so\ncalled, of a physical object, his actual field of vision, the room he\nsits in, with the book he is reading as its centre; and let him for the\npresent treat this complex object in the common-sense way as being\n'really' what it seems to be, namely, a collection of physical things\ncut out from an environing world of other physical things with which\nthese physical things have actual or potential relations. Now at the\nsame time it is just _those self-same things_ which his mind, as we say,\nperceives; and the whole philosophy of perception from Democritus's time\ndownwards has been just one long wrangle over the paradox that what is\nevidently one reality should be in two places at once, both in outer\nspace and in a person's mind. 'Representative' theories of perception\navoid the logical paradox, but on the other hand they violate the\nreader's sense of life, which knows no intervening mental image but\nseems to see the room and the book immediately just as they physically\nexist.\nThe puzzle of how the one identical room can be in two places is at\nbottom just the puzzle of how one identical point can be on two lines.\nIt can, if it be situated at their intersection; and similarly, if the\n'pure experience' of the room were a place of intersection of two\nprocesses, which connected it with different groups of associates\nrespectively, it could be counted twice over, as belonging to either\ngroup, and spoken of loosely as existing in two places, although it\nwould remain all the time a numerically single thing.\nWell, the experience is a member of diverse processes that can be\nfollowed away from it along entirely different lines. The one\nself-identical thing has so many relations to the rest of experience\nthat you can take it in disparate systems of association, and treat it\nas belonging with opposite contexts.[9] In one of these contexts it is\nyour 'field of consciousness'; in another it is 'the room in which you\nsit,' and it enters both contexts in its wholeness, giving no pretext\nfor being said to attach itself to consciousness by one of its parts or\naspects, and to outer reality by another. What are the two processes,\nnow, into which the room-experience simultaneously enters in this way?\nOne of them is the reader's personal biography, the other is the history\nof the house of which the room is part. The presentation, the\nexperience, the _that_ in short (for until we have decided _what_ it is\nit must be a mere _that_) is the last term of a train of sensations,\nemotions, decisions, movements, classifications, expectations, etc.,\nending in the present, and the first term of a series of similar 'inner'\noperations extending into the future, on the reader's part. On the other\nhand, the very same _that_ is the _terminus ad quem_ of a lot of\nprevious physical operations, carpentering, papering, furnishing,\nwarming, etc., and the _terminus a quo_ of a lot of future ones, in\nwhich it will be concerned when undergoing the destiny of a physical\nroom. The physical and the mental operations form curiously incompatible\ngroups. As a room, the experience has occupied that spot and had that\nenvironment for thirty years. As your field of consciousness it may\nnever have existed until now. As a room, attention will go on to\ndiscover endless new details in it. As your mental state merely, few new\nones will emerge under attention's eye. As a room, it will take an\nearthquake, or a gang of men, and in any case a certain amount of time,\nto destroy it. As your subjective state, the closing of your eyes, or\nany instantaneous play of your fancy will suffice. In the real world,\nfire will consume it. In your mind, you can let fire play over it\nwithout effect. As an outer object, you must pay so much a month to\ninhabit it. As an inner content, you may occupy it for any length of\ntime rent-free. If, in short, you follow it in the mental direction,\ntaking it along with events of personal biography solely, all sorts of\nthings are true of it which are false, and false of it which are true if\nyou treat it as a real thing experienced, follow it in the physical\ndirection, and relate it to associates in the outer world.\nIII\nSo far, all seems plain sailing, but my thesis will probably grow less\nplausible to the reader when I pass from percepts to concepts, or from\nthe case of things presented to that of things remote. I believe,\nnevertheless, that here also the same law holds good. If we take\nconceptual manifolds, or memories, or fancies, they also are in their\nfirst intention mere bits of pure experience, and, as such, are single\n_thats_ which act in one context as objects, and in another context\nfigure as mental states. By taking them in their first intention, I mean\nignoring their relation to possible perceptual experiences with which\nthey may be connected, which they may lead to and terminate in, and\nwhich then they may be supposed to 'represent.' Taking them in this way\nfirst, we confine the problem to a world merely 'thought-of' and not\ndirectly felt or seen.[10] This world, just like the world of percepts,\ncomes to us at first as a chaos of experiences, but lines of order soon\nget traced. We find that any bit of it which we may cut out as an\nexample is connected with distinct groups of associates, just as our\nperceptual experiences are, that these associates link themselves with\nit by different relations,[11] and that one forms the inner history of a\nperson, while the other acts as an impersonal 'objective' world, either\nspatial and temporal, or else merely logical or mathematical, or\notherwise 'ideal.'\nThe first obstacle on the part of the reader to seeing that these\nnon-perceptual experiences have objectivity as well as subjectivity will\nprobably be due to the intrusion into his mind of _percepts_, that third\ngroup of associates with which the non-perceptual experiences have\nrelations, and which, as a whole, they 'represent,' standing to them as\nthoughts to things. This important function of the non-perceptual\nexperiences complicates the question and confuses it; for, so used are\nwe to treat percepts as the sole genuine realities that, unless we keep\nthem out of the discussion, we tend altogether to overlook the\nobjectivity that lies in non-perceptual experiences by themselves. We\ntreat them, 'knowing' percepts as they do, as through and through\nsubjective, and say that they are wholly constituted of the stuff called\nconsciousness, using this term now for a kind of entity, after the\nfashion which I am seeking to refute.[12]\nAbstracting, then, from percepts altogether, what I maintain is, that\nany single non-perceptual experience tends to get counted twice over,\njust as a perceptual experience does, figuring in one context as an\nobject or field of objects, in another as a state of mind: and all this\nwithout the least internal self-diremption on its own part into\nconsciousness and content. It is all consciousness in one taking; and,\nin the other, all content.\nI find this objectivity of non-perceptual experiences, this complete\nparallelism in point of reality between the presently felt and the\nremotely thought, so well set forth in a page of M\u00fcnsterberg's\n_Grundz\u00fcge_, that I will quote it as it stands.\n\"I may only think of my objects,\" says Professor M\u00fcnsterberg; \"yet, in\nmy living thought they stand before me exactly as perceived objects\nwould do, no matter how different the two ways of apprehending them may\nbe in their genesis. The book here lying on the table before me, and the\nbook in the next room of which I think and which I mean to get, are both\nin the same sense given realities for me, realities which I acknowledge\nand of which I take account. If you agree that the perceptual object is\nnot an idea within me, but that percept and thing, as indistinguishably\none, are really experienced _there, outside_, you ought not to believe\nthat the merely thought-of object is hid away inside of the thinking\nsubject. The object of which I think, and of whose existence I take\ncognizance without letting it now work upon my senses, occupies its\ndefinite place in the outer world as much as does the object which I\ndirectly see.\"\n\"What is true of the here and the there, is also true of the now and the\nthen. I know of the thing which is present and perceived, but I know\nalso of the thing which yesterday was but is no more, and which I only\nremember. Both can determine my present conduct, both are parts of the\nreality of which I keep account. It is true that of much of the past I\nam uncertain, just as I am uncertain of much of what is present if it be\nbut dimly perceived. But the interval of time does not in principle\nalter my relation to the object, does not transform it from an object\nknown into a mental state.... The things in the room here which I\nsurvey, and those in my distant home of which I think, the things of\nthis minute and those of my long-vanished boyhood, influence and decide\nme alike, with a reality which my experience of them directly feels.\nThey both make up my real world, they make it directly, they do not have\nfirst to be introduced to me and mediated by ideas which now and here\narise within me.... This not-me character of my recollections and\nexpectations does not imply that the external objects of which I am\naware in those experiences should necessarily be there also for others.\nThe objects of dreamers and hallucinated persons are wholly without\ngeneral validity. But even were they centaurs and golden mountains, they\nstill would be 'off there,' in fairy land, and not 'inside' of\nourselves.\"[13]\nThis certainly is the immediate, primary, na\u00eff, or practical way of\ntaking our thought-of world. Were there no perceptual world to serve as\nits 'reductive,' in Taine's sense, by being 'stronger' and more\ngenuinely 'outer' (so that the whole merely thought-of world seems weak\nand inner in comparison), our world of thought would be the only world,\nand would enjoy complete reality in our belief. This actually happens in\nour dreams, and in our day-dreams so long as percepts do not interrupt\nthem.\nAnd yet, just as the seen room (to go back to our late example) is\n_also_ a field of consciousness, so the conceived or recollected room is\n_also_ a state of mind; and the doubling-up of the experience has in\nboth cases similar grounds.\nThe room thought-of, namely, has many thought-of couplings with many\nthought-of things. Some of these couplings are inconstant, others are\nstable. In the reader's personal history the room occupies a single\ndate--he saw it only once perhaps, a year ago. Of the house's history,\non the other hand, it forms a permanent ingredient. Some couplings\nhave the curious stubbornness, to borrow Royce's term, of fact; others\nshow the fluidity of fancy--we let them come and go as we please.\nGrouped with the rest of its house, with the name of its town, of its\nowner, builder, value, decorative plan, the room maintains a definite\nfoothold, to which, if we try to loosen it, it tends to return, and to\nreassert itself with force.[14] With these associates, in a word, it\ncoheres, while to other houses, other towns, other owners, etc., it\nshows no tendency to cohere at all. The two collections, first of its\ncohesive, and, second, of its loose associates, inevitably come to be\ncontrasted. We call the first collection the system of external\nrealities, in the midst of which the room, as 'real,' exists; the\nother we call the stream of our internal thinking, in which, as a\n'mental image,' it for a moment floats.[15] The room thus again gets\ncounted twice over. It plays two different r\u00f4les, being _Gedanke_ and\n_Gedachtes_, the thought-of-an-object, and the object-thought-of, both\nin one; and all this without paradox or mystery, just as the same\nmaterial thing may be both low and high, or small and great, or bad\nand good, because of its relations to opposite parts of an environing\nworld.\nAs 'subjective' we say that the experience represents; as 'objective'\nit is represented. What represents and what is represented is here\nnumerically the same; but we must remember that no dualism of being\nrepresented and representing resides in the experience _per se_. In its\npure state, or when isolated, there is no self-splitting of it into\nconsciousness and what the consciousness is 'of.' Its subjectivity and\nobjectivity are functional attributes solely, realized only when the\nexperience is 'taken,' _i.e._, talked-of, twice, considered along with\nits two differing contexts respectively, by a new retrospective\nexperience, of which that whole past complication now forms the fresh\ncontent.\nThe instant field of the present is at all times what I call the 'pure'\nexperience. It is only virtually or potentially either object or subject\nas yet. For the time being, it is plain, unqualified actuality, or\nexistence, a simple _that_. In this _na\u00eff_ immediacy it is of course\n_valid_; it is _there_, we _act_ upon it; and the doubling of it in\nretrospection into a state of mind and a reality intended thereby, is\njust one of the acts. The 'state of mind,' first treated explicitly as\nsuch in retrospection, will stand corrected or confirmed, and the\nretrospective experience in its turn will get a similar treatment; but\nthe immediate experience in its passing is always 'truth,'[16] practical\ntruth, _something to act on_, at its own movement. If the world were\nthen and there to go out like a candle, it would remain truth absolute\nand objective, for it would be 'the last word,' would have no critic,\nand no one would ever oppose the thought in it to the reality\nintended.[17]\nI think I may now claim to have made my thesis clear. Consciousness\nconnotes a kind of external relation, and does not denote a special\nstuff or way of being. _The peculiarity of our experiences, that they\nnot only are, but are known, which their 'conscious' quality is invoked\nto explain, is better explained by their relations--these relations\nthemselves being experiences--to one another._\nIV\nWere I now to go on to treat of the knowing of perceptual by conceptual\nexperiences, it would again prove to be an affair of external relations.\nOne experience would be the knower, the other the reality known; and I\ncould perfectly well define, without the notion of 'consciousness,' what\nthe knowing actually and practically amounts to--leading-towards,\nnamely, and terminating-in percepts, through a series of transitional\nexperiences which the world supplies. But I will not treat of this,\nspace being insufficient.[18] I will rather consider a few objections\nthat are sure to be urged against the entire theory as it stands.\nV\nFirst of all, this will be asked: \"If experience has not 'conscious'\nexistence, if it be not partly made of 'consciousness,' of what then is\nit made? Matter we know, and thought we know, and conscious content we\nknow, but neutral and simple 'pure experience' is something we know not\nat all. Say _what_ it consists of--for it must consist of something--or\nbe willing to give it up!\"\nTo this challenge the reply is easy. Although for fluency's sake I\nmyself spoke early in this article of a stuff of pure experience, I have\nnow to say that there is no _general_ stuff of which experience at large\nis made. There are as many stuffs as there are 'natures' in the things\nexperienced. If you ask what any one bit of pure experience is made of,\nthe answer is always the same: \"It is made of _that_, of just what\nappears, of space, of intensity, of flatness, brownness, heaviness, or\nwhat not.\" Shadworth Hodgson's analysis here leaves nothing to be\ndesired.[19] Experience is only a collective name for all these sensible\nnatures, and save for time and space (and, if you like, for 'being')\nthere appears no universal element of which all things are made.\nVI\nThe next objection is more formidable, in fact it sounds quite crushing\nwhen one hears it first.\n\"If it be the self-same piece of pure experience, taken twice over, that\nserves now as thought and now as thing\"--so the objection runs--\"how\ncomes it that its attributes should differ so fundamentally in the two\ntakings. As thing, the experience is extended; as thought, it occupies\nno space or place. As thing, it is red, hard, heavy; but who ever heard\nof a red, hard or heavy thought? Yet even now you said that an\nexperience is made of just what appears, and what appears is just such\nadjectives. How can the one experience in its thing-function be made of\nthem, consist of them, carry them as its own attributes, while in its\nthought-function it disowns them and attributes them elsewhere. There is\na self-contradiction here from which the radical dualism of thought and\nthing is the only truth that can save us. Only if the thought is one\nkind of being can the adjectives exist in it 'intentionally' (to use the\nscholastic term); only if the thing is another kind, can they exist in\nit constitutively and energetically. No simple subject can take the same\nadjectives and at one time be qualified by it, and at another time be\nmerely 'of' it, as of something only meant or known.\"\nThe solution insisted on by this objector, like many other common-sense\nsolutions, grows the less satisfactory the more one turns it in one's\nmind. To begin with, _are_ thought and thing as heterogeneous as is\ncommonly said?\nNo one denies that they have some categories in common. Their relations\nto time are identical. Both, moreover, may have parts (for psychologists\nin general treat thoughts as having them); and both may be complex or\nsimple. Both are of kinds, can be compared, added and subtracted and\narranged in serial orders. All sorts of adjectives qualify our thoughts\nwhich appear incompatible with consciousness, being as such a bare\ndiaphaneity. For instance, they are natural and easy, or laborious. They\nare beautiful, happy, intense, interesting, wise, idiotic, focal,\nmarginal, insipid, confused, vague, precise, rational, casual, general,\nparticular, and many things besides. Moreover, the chapters on\n'Perception' in the psychology-books are full of facts that make for the\nessential homogeneity of thought with thing. How, if 'subject' and\n'object' were separated 'by the whole diameter of being,' and had no\nattributes in common, could it be so hard to tell, in a presented and\nrecognized material object, what part comes in through the sense-organs\nand what part comes 'out of one's own head'? Sensations and\napperceptive ideas fuse here so intimately that you can no more tell\nwhere one begins and the other ends, than you can tell, in those cunning\ncircular panoramas that have lately been exhibited, where the real\nforeground and the painted canvas join together.[20]\nDescartes for the first time defined thought as the absolutely\nunextended, and later philosophers have accepted the description as\ncorrect. But what possible meaning has it to say that, when we think of\na foot-rule or a square yard, extension is not attributable to our\nthought? Of every extended object the _adequate_ mental picture must\nhave all the extension of the object itself. The difference between\nobjective and subjective extension is one of relation to a context\nsolely. In the mind the various extents maintain no necessarily stubborn\norder relatively to each other, while in the physical world they bound\neach other stably, and, added together, make the great enveloping Unit\nwhich we believe in and call real Space. As 'outer,' they carry\nthemselves adversely, so to speak, to one another, exclude one another\nand maintain their distances; while, as 'inner,' their order is loose,\nand they form a _durcheinander_ in which unity is lost.[21] But to argue\nfrom this that inner experience is absolutely inextensive seems to me\nlittle short of absurd. The two worlds differ, not by the presence or\nabsence of extension, but by the relations of the extensions which in\nboth worlds exist.\nDoes not this case of extension now put us on the track of truth in the\ncase of other qualities? It does; and I am surprised that the facts\nshould not have been noticed long ago. Why, for example, do we call a\nfire hot, and water wet, and yet refuse to say that our mental state,\nwhen it is 'of' these objects, is either wet or hot? 'Intentionally,' at\nany rate, and when the mental state is a vivid image, hotness and\nwetness are in it just as much as they are in the physical experience.\nThe reason is this, that, as the general chaos of all our experiences\ngets sifted, we find that there are some fires that will always burn\nsticks and always warm our bodies, and that there are some waters that\nwill always put out fires; while there are other fires and waters that\nwill not act at all. The general group of experiences that _act_, that\ndo not only possess their natures intrinsically, but wear them\nadjectively and energetically, turning them against one another, comes\ninevitably to be contrasted with the group whose members, having\nidentically the same natures, fail to manifest them in the 'energetic'\nway.[22] I make for myself now an experience of blazing fire; I place it\nnear my body; but it does not warm me in the least. I lay a stick upon\nit, and the stick either burns or remains green, as I please. I call up\nwater, and pour it on the fire, and absolutely no difference ensues. I\naccount for all such facts by calling this whole train of experiences\nunreal, a mental train. Mental fire is what won't burn real sticks;\nmental water is what won't necessarily (though of course it may) put out\neven a mental fire. Mental knives may be sharp, but they won't cut real\nwood. Mental triangles are pointed, but their points won't wound. With\n'real' objects, on the contrary, consequences always accrue; and thus\nthe real experiences get sifted from the mental ones, the things from\nour thoughts of them, fanciful or true, and precipitated together as the\nstable part of the whole experience-chaos, under the name of the\nphysical world. Of this our perceptual experiences are the nucleus, they\nbeing the originally strong experiences. We add a lot of conceptual\nexperiences to them, making these strong also in imagination, and\nbuilding out the remoter parts of the physical world by their means; and\naround this core of reality the world of laxly connected fancies and\nmere rhapsodical objects floats like a bank of clouds. In the clouds,\nall sorts of rules are violated which in the core are kept. Extensions\nthere can be indefinitely located; motion there obeys no Newton's laws.\nVII\nThere is a peculiar class of experiences to which, whether we take them\nas subjective or as objective, we _assign_ their several natures as\nattributes, because in both contexts they affect their associates\nactively, though in neither quite as 'strongly' or as sharply as things\naffect one another by their physical energies. I refer here to\n_appreciations_, which form an ambiguous sphere of being, belonging with\nemotion on the one hand, and having objective 'value' on the other, yet\nseeming not quite inner nor quite outer, as if a diremption had begun\nbut had not made itself complete.[23]\nExperiences of painful objects, for example, are usually also painful\nexperiences; perceptions of loveliness, of ugliness, tend to pass muster\nas lovely or as ugly perceptions; intuitions of the morally lofty are\nlofty intuitions. Sometimes the adjective wanders as if uncertain where\nto fix itself. Shall we speak of seductive visions or of visions of\nseductive things? Of wicked desires or of desires for wickedness? Of\nhealthy thoughts or of thoughts of healthy objects? Of good impulses, or\nof impulses towards the good? Of feelings of anger, or of angry\nfeelings? Both in the mind and in the thing, these natures modify their\ncontext, exclude certain associates and determine others, have their\nmates and incompatibles. Yet not as stubbornly as in the case of\nphysical qualities, for beauty and ugliness, love and hatred, pleasant\nand painful can, in certain complex experiences, coexist.\nIf one were to make an evolutionary construction of how a lot of\noriginally chaotic pure experiences became gradually differentiated into\nan orderly inner and outer world, the whole theory would turn upon one's\nsuccess in explaining how or why the quality of an experience, once\nactive, could become less so, and, from being an energetic attribute in\nsome cases, elsewhere lapse into the status of an inert or merely\ninternal 'nature.' This would be the 'evolution' of the psychical from\nthe bosom of the physical, in which the esthetic, moral and otherwise\nemotional experiences would represent a halfway stage.\nVIII\nBut a last cry of _non possumus_ will probably go up from many readers.\n\"All very pretty as a piece of ingenuity,\" they will say, \"but our\nconsciousness itself intuitively contradicts you. We, for our part,\n_know_ that we are conscious. We _feel_ our thought, flowing as a life\nwithin us, in absolute contrast with the objects which it so\nunremittingly escorts. We can not be faithless to this immediate\nintuition. The dualism is a fundamental _datum_: Let no man join what\nGod has put asunder.\"\nMy reply to this is my last word, and I greatly grieve that to many it\nwill sound materialistic. I can not help that, however, for I, too, have\nmy intuitions and I must obey them. Let the case be what it may in\nothers, I am as confident as I am of anything that, in myself, the\nstream of thinking (which I recognize emphatically as a phenomenon) is\nonly a careless name for what, when scrutinized, reveals itself to\nconsist chiefly of the stream of my breathing. The 'I think' which Kant\nsaid must be able to accompany all my objects, is the 'I breathe' which\nactually does accompany them. There are other internal facts besides\nbreathing (intracephalic muscular adjustments, etc., of which I have\nsaid a word in my larger Psychology), and these increase the assets of\n'consciousness,' so far as the latter is subject to immediate\nperception;[24] but breath, which was ever the original of 'spirit,'\nbreath moving outwards, between the glottis and the nostrils, is, I am\npersuaded, the essence out of which philosophers have constructed the\nentity known to them as consciousness. _That entity is fictitious, while\nthoughts in the concrete are fully real. But thoughts in the concrete\nare made of the same stuff as things are._\nI wish I might believe myself to have made that plausible in this\narticle. In another article I shall try to make the general notion of a\nworld composed of pure experiences still more clear.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[2] [Reprinted from the _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

The dissatisfaction with these seems due for the most\npart to a feeling that they are too abstract and academic. Life is\nconfused and superabundant, and what the younger generation appears to\ncrave is more of the temperament of life in its philosophy, even though\nit were at some cost of logical rigor and of formal purity.\nTranscendental idealism is inclining to let the world wag\nincomprehensibly, in spite of its Absolute Subject and his unity of\npurpose. Berkeleyan idealism is abandoning the principle of parsimony\nand dabbling in panpsychic speculations. Empiricism flirts with\nteleology; and, strangest of all, natural realism, so long decently\nburied, raises its head above the turf, and finds glad hands\noutstretched from the most unlikely quarters to help it to its feet\nagain. We are all biased by our personal feelings, I know, and I am\npersonally discontented with extant solutions; so I seem to read the\nsigns of a great unsettlement, as if the upheaval of more real\nconceptions and more fruitful methods were imminent, as if a true\nlandscape might result, less clipped, straight-edged and artificial.\nIf philosophy be really on the eve of any considerable rearrangement,\nthe time should be propitious for any one who has suggestions of his own\nto bring forward. For many years past my mind has been growing into a\ncertain type of _Weltanschauung_. Rightly or wrongly, I have got to the\npoint where I can hardly see things in any other pattern. I propose,\ntherefore, to describe the pattern as clearly as I can consistently with\ngreat brevity, and to throw my description into the bubbling vat of\npublicity where, jostled by rivals and torn by critics, it will\neventually either disappear from notice, or else, if better luck befall\nit, quietly subside to the profundities, and serve as a possible ferment\nof new growths or a nucleus of new crystallization.\nI. RADICAL EMPIRICISM\nI give the name of 'radical empiricism' to my _Weltanschauung_.\nEmpiricism is known as the opposite of rationalism. Rationalism tends to\nemphasize universals and to make wholes prior to parts in the order of\nlogic as well as in that of being. Empiricism, on the contrary, lays the\nexplanatory stress upon the part, the element, the individual, and\ntreats the whole as a collection and the universal as an abstraction. My\ndescription of things, accordingly, starts with the parts and makes of\nthe whole a being of the second order. It is essentially a mosaic\nphilosophy, a philosophy of plural facts, like that of Hume and his\ndescendants, who refer these facts neither to Substances in which they\ninhere nor to an Absolute Mind that creates them as its objects. But it\ndiffers from the Humian type of empiricism in one particular which makes\nme add the epithet radical.\nTo be radical, an empiricism must neither admit into its constructions\nany element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them any\nelement that is directly experienced. For such a philosophy, _the\nrelations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced\nrelations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as\n'real' as anything else in the system_. Elements may indeed be\nredistributed, the original placing of things getting corrected, but a\nreal place must be found for every kind of thing experienced, whether\nterm or relation, in the final philosophic arrangement.\nNow, ordinary empiricism, in spite of the fact that conjunctive and\ndisjunctive relations present themselves as being fully co-ordinate\nparts of experience, has always shown a tendency to do away with the\nconnections of things, and to insist most on the disjunctions.\nBerkeley's nominalism, Hume's statement that whatever things we\ndistinguish are as 'loose and separate' as if they had 'no manner of\nconnection,' James Mill's denial that similars have anything 'really' in\ncommon, the resolution of the causal tie into habitual sequence, John\nMill's account of both physical things and selves as composed of\ndiscontinuous possibilities, and the general pulverization of all\nExperience by association and the mind-dust theory, are examples of what\nI mean.[26]\nThe natural result of such a world-picture has been the efforts of\nrationalism to correct its incoherencies by the addition of\ntrans-experiential agents of unification, substances, intellectual\ncategories and powers, or Selves; whereas, if empiricism had only been\nradical and taken everything that comes without disfavor, conjunction as\nwell as separation, each at its face value, the results would have\ncalled for no such artificial correction. _Radical empiricism_, as I\nunderstand it, _does full justice to conjunctive relations_, without,\nhowever, treating them as rationalism always tends to treat them, as\nbeing true in some supernal way, as if the unity of things and their\nvariety belonged to different orders of truth and vitality altogether.\nII. CONJUNCTIVE RELATIONS\nRelations are of different degrees of intimacy. Merely to be 'with' one\nanother in a universe of discourse is the most external relation that\nterms can have, and seems to involve nothing whatever as to farther\nconsequences. Simultaneity and time-interval come next, and then\nspace-adjacency and distance. After them, similarity and difference,\ncarrying the possibility of many inferences. Then relations of activity,\ntying terms into series involving change, tendency, resistance, and the\ncausal order generally. Finally, the relation experienced between terms\nthat form states of mind, and are immediately conscious of continuing\neach other. The organization of the Self as a system of memories,\npurposes, strivings, fulfilments or disappointments, is incidental to\nthis most intimate of all relations, the terms of which seem in many\ncases actually to compenetrate and suffuse each other's being.[27]\nPhilosophy has always turned on grammatical particles. With, near, next,\nlike, from, towards, against, because, for, through, my--these words\ndesignate types of conjunctive relation arranged in a roughly ascending\norder of intimacy and inclusiveness. _A priori_, we can imagine a\nuniverse of withness but no nextness; or one of nextness but no\nlikeness, or of likeness with no activity, or of activity with no\npurpose, or of purpose with no ego. These would be universes, each with\nits own grade of unity. The universe of human experience is, by one or\nanother of its parts, of each and all these grades. Whether or not it\npossibly enjoys some still more absolute grade of union does not appear\nupon the surface.\nTaken as it does appear, our universe is to a large extent chaotic. No\none single type of connection runs through all the experiences that\ncompose it. If we take space-relations, they fail to connect minds into\nany regular system. Causes and purposes obtain only among special series\nof facts. The self-relation seems extremely limited and does not link\ntwo different selves together. _Prima facie_, if you should liken the\nuniverse of absolute idealism to an aquarium, a crystal globe in which\ngoldfish are swimming, you would have to compare the empiricist universe\nto something more like one of those dried human heads with which the\nDyaks of Borneo deck their lodges. The skull forms a solid nucleus; but\ninnumerable feathers, leaves, strings, beads, and loose appendices of\nevery description float and dangle from it, and, save that they\nterminate in it, seem to have nothing to do with one another. Even so my\nexperiences and yours float and dangle, terminating, it is true, in a\nnucleus of common perception, but for the most part out of sight and\nirrelevant and unimaginable to one another. This imperfect intimacy,\nthis bare relation of _withness_ between some parts of the sum total of\nexperience and other parts, is the fact that ordinary empiricism\nover-emphasizes against rationalism, the latter always tending to ignore\nit unduly. Radical empiricism, on the contrary, is fair to both the\nunity and the disconnection. It finds no reason for treating either as\nillusory. It allots to each its definite sphere of description, and\nagrees that there appear to be actual forces at work which tend, as time\ngoes on, to make the unity greater.\nThe conjunctive relation that has given most trouble to philosophy is\nthe _co-conscious transition_, so to call it, by which one experience\npasses into another when both belong to the same self. About the facts\nthere is no question. My experiences and your experiences are 'with'\neach other in various external ways, but mine pass into mine, and yours\npass into yours in a way in which yours and mine never pass into one\nanother. Within each of our personal histories, subject, object,\ninterest and purpose _are continuous or may be continuous_.[28] Personal\nhistories are processes of change in time, and _the change itself is one\nof the things immediately experienced_. 'Change' in this case means\ncontinuous as opposed to discontinuous transition. But continuous\ntransition is one sort of a conjunctive relation; and to be a radical\nempiricist means to hold fast to this conjunctive relation of all\nothers, for this is the strategic point, the position through which, if\na hole be made, all the corruptions of dialectics and all the\nmetaphysical fictions pour into our philosophy. The holding fast to this\nrelation means taking it at its face value, neither less nor more; and\nto take it at its face value means first of all to take it just as we\nfeel it, and not to confuse ourselves with abstract talk _about_ it,\ninvolving words that drive us to invent secondary conceptions in order\nto neutralize their suggestions and to make our actual experience again\nseem rationally possible.\nWhat I do feel simply when a later moment of my experience succeeds an\nearlier one is that though they are two moments, the transition from the\none to the other is _continuous_. Continuity here is a definite sort of\nexperience; just as definite as is the _discontinuity-experience_ which\nI find it impossible to avoid when I seek to make the transition from an\nexperience of my own to one of yours. In this latter case I have to get\non and off again, to pass from a thing lived to another thing only\nconceived, and the break is positively experienced and noted. Though the\nfunctions exerted by my experience and by yours may be the same (_e.g._,\nthe same objects known and the same purposes followed), yet the sameness\nhas in this case to be ascertained expressly (and often with difficulty\nand uncertainty) after the break has been felt; whereas in passing from\none of my own moments to another the sameness of object and interest is\nunbroken, and both the earlier and the later experience are of things\ndirectly lived.\nThere is no other _nature_, no other whatness than this absence of break\nand this sense of continuity in that most intimate of all conjunctive\nrelations, the passing of one experience into another when they belong\nto the same self. And this whatness is real empirical 'content,' just as\nthe whatness of separation and discontinuity is real content in the\ncontrasted case. Practically to experience one's personal continuum in\nthis living way is to know the originals of the ideas of continuity and\nof sameness, to know what the words stand for concretely, to own all\nthat they can ever mean. But all experiences have their conditions; and\nover-subtle intellects, thinking about the facts here, and asking how\nthey are possible, have ended by substituting a lot of static objects of\nconception for the direct perceptual experiences. \"Sameness,\" they have\nsaid, \"must be a stark numerical identity; it can't run on from next to\nnext. Continuity can't mean mere absence of gap; for if you say two\nthings are in immediate contact, _at_ the contact how can they be two?\nIf, on the other hand, you put a relation of transition between them,\nthat itself is a third thing, and needs to be related or hitched to its\nterms. An infinite series is involved,\" and so on. The result is that\nfrom difficulty to difficulty, the plain conjunctive experience has been\ndiscredited by both schools, the empiricists leaving things permanently\ndisjoined, and the rationalist remedying the looseness by their\nAbsolutes or Substances, or whatever other fictitious agencies of union\nthey may have employed.[29] From all which artificiality we can be saved\nby a couple of simple reflections: first, that conjunctions and\nseparations are, at all events, co-ordinate phenomena which, if we take\nexperiences at their face value, must be accounted equally real; and\nsecond, that if we insist on treating things as really separate when\nthey are given as continuously joined, invoking, when union is required,\ntranscendental principles to overcome the separateness we have assumed,\nthen we ought to stand ready to perform the converse act. We ought to\ninvoke higher principles of _dis_union, also, to make our merely\nexperienced disjunctions more truly real. Failing thus, we ought to let\nthe originally given continuities stand on their own bottom. We have no\nright to be lopsided or to blow capriciously hot and cold.\nIII. THE COGNITIVE RELATION\nThe first great pitfall from which such a radical standing by experience\nwill save us is an artificial conception of the _relations between\nknower and known_. Throughout the history of philosophy the subject and\nits object have been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities; and\nthereupon the presence of the latter to the former, or the\n'apprehension' by the former of the latter, has assumed a paradoxical\ncharacter which all sorts of theories had to be invented to overcome.\nRepresentative theories put a mental 'representation,' 'image,' or\n'content' into the gap, as a sort of intermediary. Common-sense theories\nleft the gap untouched, declaring our mind able to clear it by a\nself-transcending leap. Transcendentalist theories left it impossible to\ntraverse by finite knowers, and brought an Absolute in to perform the\nsaltatory act. All the while, in the very bosom of the finite\nexperience, every conjunction required to make the relation intelligible\nis given in full. Either the knower and the known are:\n(1) the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different\ncontexts; or they are\n(2) two pieces of _actual_ experience belonging to the same subject,\nwith definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience between\nthem; or\n(3) the known is a _possible_ experience either of that subject or\nanother, to which the said conjunctive transitions _would_ lead, if\nsufficiently prolonged.\nTo discuss all the ways in which one experience may function as the\nknower of another, would be incompatible with the limits of this\nessay.[30] I have just treated of type 1, the kind of knowledge called\nperception.[31] This is the type of case in which the mind enjoys direct\n'acquaintance' with a present object. In the other types the mind has\n'knowledge-about' an object not immediately there. Of type 2, the\nsimplest sort of conceptual knowledge, I have given some account in two\n[earlier] articles.[32] Type 3 can always formally and hypothetically be\nreduced to type 2, so that a brief description of that type will put the\npresent reader sufficiently at my point of view, and make him see what\nthe actual meanings of the mysterious cognitive relation may be.\nSuppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge, at ten\nminutes' walk from 'Memorial Hall,' and to be thinking truly of the\nlatter object. My mind may have before it only the name, or it may have\na clear image, or it may have a very dim image of the hall, but such\nintrinsic differences in the image make no difference in its cognitive\nfunction. Certain _extrinsic_ phenomena, special experiences of\nconjunction, are what impart to the image, be it what it may, its\nknowing office.\nFor instance, if you ask me what hall I mean by my image, and I can\ntell you nothing; or if I fail to point or lead you towards the Harvard\nDelta; or if, being led by you, I am uncertain whether the Hall I see be\nwhat I had in mind or not; you would rightly deny that I had 'meant'\nthat particular hall at all, even though my mental image might to some\ndegree have resembled it. The resemblance would count in that case as\ncoincidental merely, for all sorts of things of a kind resemble one\nanother in this world without being held for that reason to take\ncognizance of one another.\nOn the other hand, if I can lead you to the hall, and tell you of its\nhistory and present uses; if in its presence I feel my idea, however\nimperfect it may have been, to have led hither and to be now\n_terminated;_ if the associates of the image and of the felt hall run\nparallel, so that each term of the one context corresponds serially, as\nI walk, with an answering term of the others; why then my soul was\nprophetic, and my idea must be, and by common consent would be, called\ncognizant of reality. That percept was what I _meant_, for into it my\nidea has passed by conjunctive experiences of sameness and fulfilled\nintention. Nowhere is there jar, but every later moment continues and\ncorroborates an earlier one.\nIn this continuing and corroborating, taken in no transcendental sense,\nbut denoting definitely felt transitions, _lies all that the knowing of\na percept by an idea can possibly contain or signify_. Wherever such\ntransitions are felt, the first experience _knows_ the last one. Where\nthey do not, or where even as possibles they can not, intervene, there\ncan be no pretence of knowing. In this latter case the extremes will be\nconnected, if connected at all, by inferior relations--bare likeness or\nsuccession, or by 'withness' alone. Knowledge of sensible realities thus\ncomes to life inside the tissue of experience. It is _made_; and made by\nrelations that unroll themselves in time. Whenever certain\nintermediaries are given, such that, as they develop towards their\nterminus, there is experience from point to point of one direction\nfollowed, and finally of one process fulfilled, the result is that\n_their starting-point thereby becomes a knower and their terminus an\nobject meant or known_. That is all that knowing (in the simple case\nconsidered) can be known-as, that is the whole of its nature, put into\nexperiential terms. Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences we\nmay freely say that we had the terminal object 'in mind' from the\noutset, even although _at_ the outset nothing was there in us but a flat\npiece of substantive experience like any other, with no\nself-transcendency about it, and no mystery save the mystery of coming\ninto existence and of being gradually followed by other pieces of\nsubstantive experience, with conjunctively transitional experiences\nbetween. That is what we _mean_ here by the object's being 'in mind.' Of\nany deeper more real way of being in mind we have no positive\nconception, and we have no right to discredit our actual experience by\ntalking of such a way at all.\nI know that many a reader will rebel at this. \"Mere intermediaries,\" he\nwill say, \"even though they be feelings of continuously growing\nfulfilment, only _separate_ the knower from the known, whereas what we\nhave in knowledge is a kind of immediate touch of the one by the other,\nan 'apprehension' in the etymological sense of the word, a leaping of\nthe chasm as by lightning, an act by which two terms are smitten into\none, over the head of their distinctness. All these dead intermediaries\nof yours are out of each other, and outside of their termini still.\"\nBut do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping his\nbone and snapping at its image in the water? If we knew any more real\nkind of union _aliunde_, we might be entitled to brand all our\nempirical unions as a sham. But unions by continuous transition are the\nonly ones we know of, whether in this matter of a knowledge-about that\nterminates in an acquaintance, whether in personal identity, in logical\npredication through the copula 'is,' or elsewhere. If anywhere there\nwere more absolute unions realized, they could only reveal themselves to\nus by just such conjunctive results. These are what the unions are\n_worth_, these are all that _we can ever practically mean_ by union, by\ncontinuity. Is it not time to repeat what Lotze said of substances, that\nto _act like_ one is to _be_ one?[33] Should we not say here that to be\nexperienced as continuous is to be really continuous, in a world where\nexperience and reality come to the same thing? In a picture gallery a\npainted hook will serve to hang a painted chain by, a painted cable will\nhold a painted ship. In a world where both the terms and their\ndistinctions are affairs of experience, conjunctions that are\nexperienced must be at least as real as anything else. They will be'\nabsolutely' real conjunctions, if we have no transphenomenal Absolute\nready, to derealize the whole experienced world by, at a stroke. If, on\nthe other hand, we had such an Absolute, not one of our opponents'\ntheories of knowledge could remain standing any better than ours could;\nfor the distinctions as well as the conjunctions of experience would\nimpartially fall its prey. The whole question of how 'one' thing can\nknow 'another' would cease to be a real one at all in a world where\notherness itself was an illusion.[34]\nSo much for the essentials of the cognitive relation, where the\nknowledge is conceptual in type, or forms knowledge 'about' an object.\nIt consists in intermediary experiences (possible, if not actual) of\ncontinuously developing progress, and, finally, of fulfilment, when the\nsensible percept, which is the object, is reached. The percept here not\nonly _verifies_ the concept, proves its function of knowing that percept\nto be true, but the percept's existence as the terminus of the chain of\nintermediaries _creates_ the function. Whatever terminates that chain\nwas, because it now proves itself to be, what the concept 'had in mind.'\nThe towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies in\nthe fact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\n_representative_, not in any quasi-miraculous 'epistemological' sense,\nbut in the definite practical sense of being its _substitute_ in various\noperations, sometimes physical and sometimes mental, which lead us to\nits associates and results. By experimenting on our ideas of reality, we\nmay save ourselves the trouble of experimenting on the real experiences\nwhich they severally mean. The ideas form related systems, corresponding\npoint for point to the systems which the realities form; and by letting\nan ideal term call up its associates systematically, we may be led to a\nterminus which the corresponding real term would have led to in case we\nhad operated on the real world. And this brings us to the general\nquestion of substitution.\nIV. SUBSTITUTION\nIn Taine's brilliant book on 'Intelligence,' substitution was for the\nfirst time named as a cardinal logical function, though of course the\nfacts had always been familiar enough. What, exactly, in a system of\nexperiences, does the 'substitution' of one of them for another mean?\nAccording to my view, experience as a whole is a process in time,\nwhereby innumerable particular terms lapse and are superseded by others\nthat follow upon them by transitions which, whether disjunctive or\nconjunctive in content, are themselves experiences, and must in general\nbe accounted at least as real as the terms which they relate. What the\nnature of the event called 'superseding' signifies, depends altogether\non the kind of transition that obtains. Some experiences simply abolish\ntheir predecessors without continuing them in any way. Others are felt\nto increase or to enlarge their meaning, to carry out their purpose, or\nto bring us nearer to their goal. They 'represent' them, and may fulfil\ntheir function better than they fulfilled it themselves. But to 'fulfil\na function' in a world of pure experience can be conceived and defined\nin only one possible way. In such a world transitions and arrivals (or\nterminations) are the only events that happen, though they happen by so\nmany sorts of path. The only function that one experience can perform is\nto lead into another experience; and the only fulfilment we can speak of\nis the reaching of a certain experienced end. When one experience leads\nto (or can lead to) the same end as another, they agree in function. But\nthe whole system of experiences as they are immediately given presents\nitself as a quasi-chaos through which one can pass out of an initial\nterm in many directions and yet end in the same terminus, moving from\nnext to next by a great many possible paths.\nEither one of these paths might be a functional substitute for another,\nand to follow one rather than another might on occasion be an\nadvantageous thing to do. As a matter of fact, and in a general way,\nthe paths that run through conceptual experiences, that is, through\n'thoughts' or 'ideas' that 'know' the things in which they terminate,\nare highly advantageous paths to follow. Not only do they yield\ninconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the 'universal'\ncharacter[35] which they frequently possess, and to their capacity for\nassociation with one another in great systems, they outstrip the tardy\nconsecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us on towards our\nultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than the following of\ntrains of sensible perception ever could. Wonderful are the new cuts and\nthe short-circuits which the thought-paths make. Most thought-paths, it\nis true, are substitutes for nothing actual; they end outside the real\nworld altogether, in wayward fancies, utopias, fictions or mistakes. But\nwhere they do re-enter reality and terminate therein, we substitute them\nalways; and with these substitutes we pass the greater number of our\nhours.\nThis is why I called our experiences, taken all together, a quasi-chaos.\nThere is vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiences than\nwe commonly suppose. The objective nucleus of every man's experience,\nhis own body, is, it is true, a continuous percept; and equally\ncontinuous as a percept (though we may be inattentive to it) is the\nmaterial environment of that body, changing by gradual transition when\nthe body moves. But the distant parts of the physical world are at all\ntimes absent from us, and form conceptual objects merely, into the\nperceptual reality of which our life inserts itself at points discrete\nand relatively rare. Round their several objective nuclei, partly shared\nand common and partly discrete, of the real physical world, innumerable\nthinkers, pursuing their several lines of physically true cogitation,\ntrace paths that intersect one another only at discontinuous perceptual\npoints, and the rest of the time are quite incongruent; and around all\nthe nuclei of shared 'reality,' as around the Dyak's head of my late\nmetaphor, floats the vast cloud of experiences that are wholly\nsubjective, that are non-substitutional, that find not even an eventual\nending for themselves in the perceptual world--the mere day-dreams and\njoys and sufferings and wishes of the individual minds. These exist\n_with_ one another, indeed, and with the objective nuclei, but out of\nthem it is probable that to all eternity no interrelated system of any\nkind will ever be made.\nThis notion of the purely substitutional or conceptual physical world\nbrings us to the most critical of all the steps in the development of a\nphilosophy of pure experience. The paradox of self-transcendency in\nknowledge comes back upon us here, but I think that our notions of pure\nexperience and of substitution, and our radically empirical view of\nconjunctive transitions, are _Denkmittel_ that will carry us safely\nthrough the pass.\nV. WHAT OBJECTIVE REFERENCE IS.\nWhosoever feels his experience to be something substitutional even while\nhe has it, may be said to have an experience that reaches beyond itself.\nFrom inside of its own entity it says 'more,' and postulates reality\nexisting elsewhere. For the transcendentalist, who holds knowing to\nconsist in a _salto mortale_ across an 'epistemological chasm,' such an\nidea presents no difficulty; but it seems at first sight as if it might\nbe inconsistent with an empiricism like our own. Have we not explained\nthat conceptual knowledge is made such wholly by the existence of things\nthat fall outside of the knowing experience itself--by intermediary\nexperiences and by a terminus that fulfils? Can the knowledge be there\nbefore these elements that constitute its being have come? And, if\nknowledge be not there, how can objective reference occur?\nThe key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing as\nverified and completed, and the same knowing as in transit and on its\nway. To recur to the Memorial Hall example lately used, it is only when\nour idea of the Hall has actually terminated in the percept that we know\n'for certain' that from the beginning it was truly cognitive of _that_.\nUntil established by the end of the process, its quality of knowing\nthat, or indeed of knowing anything, could still be doubted; and yet the\nknowing really was there, as the result now shows. We were _virtual_\nknowers of the Hall long before we were certified to have been its\nactual knowers, by the percept's retroactive validating power. Just so\nwe are 'mortal' all the time, by reason of the virtuality of the\ninevitable event which will make us so when it shall have come.\nNow the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond this\nvirtual stage. It never is completed or nailed down. I speak not merely\nof our ideas of imperceptibles like ether-waves or dissociated 'ions,'\nor of 'ejects' like the contents of our neighbors' minds; I speak also\nof ideas which we might verify if we would take the trouble, but which\nwe hold for true although unterminated perceptually, because nothing\nsays 'no' to us, and there is no contradicting truth in sight. _To\ncontinue thinking unchallenged is, ninety-nine times out of a hundred,\nour practical substitute for knowing in the completed sense._ As each\nexperience runs by cognitive transition into the next one, and we\nnowhere feel a collision with what we elsewhere count as truth or fact,\nwe commit ourselves to the current as if the port were sure. We live, as\nit were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-crest, and our sense\nof a determinate direction in falling forward is all we cover of the\nfuture of our path. It is as if a differential quotient should be\nconscious and treat itself as an adequate substitute for a traced-out\ncurve. Our experience, _inter alia_, is of variations of rate and of\ndirection, and lives in these transitions more than in the journey's\nend. The experiences of tendency are sufficient to act upon--what more\ncould we have _done_ at those moments even if the later verification\ncomes complete?\nThis is what, as a radical empiricist, I say to the charge that the\nobjective reference which is so flagrant a character of our experiences\ninvolves a chasm and a mortal leap. A positively conjunctive transition\ninvolves neither chasm nor leap. Being the very original of what we mean\nby continuity, it makes a continuum wherever it appears. I know full\nwell that such brief words as these will leave the hardened\ntranscendentalist unshaken. Conjunctive experiences _separate_ their\nterms, he will still say: they are third things interposed, that have\nthemselves to be conjoined by new links, and to invoke them makes our\ntrouble infinitely worse. To 'feel' our motion forward is impossible.\nMotion implies terminus; and how can terminus be felt before we have\narrived? The barest start and sally forwards, the barest tendency to\nleave the instant, involves the chasm and the leap. Conjunctive\ntransitions are the most superficial of appearances, illusions of our\nsensibility which philosophical reflection pulverizes at a touch.\nConception is our only trustworthy instrument, conception and the\nAbsolute working hand in hand. Conception disintegrates experience\nutterly, but its disjunctions are easily overcome again when the\nAbsolute takes up the task.\nSuch transcendentalists I must leave, provisionally at least, in full\npossession of their creed.[36] I have no space for polemics in this\narticle, so I shall simply formulate the empiricist doctrine as my\nhypothesis, leaving it to work or not work as it may.\nObjective reference, I say then, is an incident of the fact that so much\nof our experience comes as an insufficient and consists of process and\ntransition. Our fields of experience have no more definite boundaries\nthan have our fields of view. Both are fringed forever by a _more_ that\ncontinuously develops, and that continuously supersedes them as life\nproceeds. The relations, generally speaking, are as real here as the\nterms are, and the only complaint of the transcendentalist's with which\nI could at all sympathize would be his charge that, by first making\nknowledge to consist in external relations as I have done, and by then\nconfessing that nine-tenths of the time these are not actually but only\nvirtually there, I have knocked the solid bottom out of the whole\nbusiness, and palmed off a substitute of knowledge for the genuine\nthing. Only the admission, such a critic might say, that our ideas are\nself-transcendent and 'true' already, in advance of the experiences that\nare to terminate them, can bring solidity back to knowledge in a world\nlike this, in which transitions and terminations are only by exception\nfulfilled.\nThis seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic method.\nWhen a dispute arises, that method consists in auguring what practical\nconsequences would be different if one side rather than the other were\ntrue. If no difference can be thought of, the dispute is a quarrel over\nwords. What then would the self-transcendency affirmed to exist in\nadvance of all experiential mediation or termination, be _known-as_?\nWhat would it practically result in for _us_, were it true?\nIt could only result in our orientation, in the turning of our\nexpectations and practical tendencies into the right path; and the\nright path here, so long as we and the object are not yet face to face\n(or can never get face to face, as in the case of ejects), would be the\npath that led us into the object's nearest neighborhood. Where direct\nacquaintance is lacking, 'knowledge about' is the next best thing, and\nan acquaintance with what actually lies about the object, and is most\nclosely related to it, puts such knowledge within our grasp. Ether-waves\nand your anger, for example, are things in which my thoughts will never\n_perceptually_ terminate, but my concepts of them lead me to their very\nbrink, to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful words and deeds which\nare their really next effects.\nEven if our ideas did in themselves carry the postulated\nself-transcendency, it would still remain true that their putting us\ninto possession of such effects _would be the sole cash-value of the\nself-transcendency for us_. And this cash-value, it is needless to say,\nis _verbatim et literatim_ what our empiricist account pays in. On\npragmatist principles therefore, a dispute over self-transcendency is a\npure logomachy. Call our concepts of ejective things self-transcendent\nor the reverse, it makes no difference, so long as we don't differ about\nthe nature of that exalted virtue's fruits--fruits for us, of course,\nhumanistic fruits. If an Absolute were proved to exist for other\nreasons, it might well appear that _his_ knowledge is terminated in\ninnumerable cases where ours is still incomplete. That, however, would\nbe a fact indifferent to our knowledge. The latter would grow neither\nworse nor better, whether we acknowledged such an Absolute or left him\nout.\nSo the notion of a knowledge still _in transitu_ and on its way joins\nhands here with that notion of a 'pure experience' which I tried to\nexplain in my [essay] entitled 'Does Consciousness Exist?' The instant\nfield of the present is always experience in its 'pure' state, plain\nunqualified actuality, a simple _that_, as yet undifferentiated into\nthing and thought, and only virtually classifiable as objective fact or\nas some one's opinion about fact. This is as true when the field is\nconceptual as when it is perceptual. 'Memorial Hall' is 'there' in my\nidea as much as when I stand before it. I proceed to act on its account\nin either case. Only in the later experience that supersedes the present\none is this _na\u00eff_ immediacy retrospectively split into two parts, a\n'consciousness' and its 'content,' and the content corrected or\nconfirmed. While still pure, or present, any experience--mine, for\nexample, of what I write about in these very lines--passes for 'truth.'\nThe morrow may reduce it to 'opinion.' The transcendentalist in all his\nparticular knowledges is as liable to this reduction as I am: his\nAbsolute does not save him. Why, then, need he quarrel with an account\nof knowing that merely leaves it liable to this inevitable condition?\nWhy insist that knowing is a static relation out of time when it\npractically seems so much a function of our active life? For a thing to\nbe valid, says Lotze, is the same as to make itself valid. When the\nwhole universe seems only to be making itself valid and to be still\nincomplete (else why its ceaseless changing?) why, of all things,\nshould knowing be exempt? Why should it not be making itself valid like\neverything else? That some parts of it may be already valid or verified\nbeyond dispute, the empirical philosopher, of course, like any one else,\nmay always hope.\nVI. THE CONTERMINOUSNESS OF DIFFERENT MINDS[37]\nWith transition and prospect thus enthroned in pure experience, it is\nimpossible to subscribe to the idealism of the English school. Radical\nempiricism has, in fact, more affinities with natural realism than with\nthe views of Berkeley or of Mill, and this can be easily shown.\nFor the Berkeleyan school, ideas (the verbal equivalent of what I term\nexperiences) are discontinuous. The content of each is wholly immanent,\nand there are no transitions with which they are consubstantial and\nthrough which their beings may unite. Your Memorial Hall and mine, even\nwhen both are percepts, are wholly out of connection with each other.\nOur lives are a congeries of solipsisms, out of which in strict logic\nonly a God could compose a universe even of discourse. No dynamic\ncurrents run between my objects and your objects. Never can our minds\nmeet in the _same_.\nThe incredibility of such a philosophy is flagrant. It is 'cold,\nstrained, and unnatural' in a supreme degree; and it may be doubted\nwhether even Berkeley himself, who took it so religiously, really\nbelieved, when walking through the streets of London, that his spirit\nand the spirits of his fellow wayfarers had absolutely different towns\nin view.\nTo me the decisive reason in favor of our minds meeting in _some_ common\nobjects at least is that, unless I make that supposition, I have no\nmotive for assuming that your mind exists at all. Why do I postulate\nyour mind? Because I see your body acting in a certain way. Its\ngestures, facial movements, words and conduct generally, are\n'expressive,' so I deem it actuated as my own is, by an inner life like\nmine. This argument from analogy is my _reason_, whether an instinctive\nbelief runs before it or not. But what is 'your body' here but a percept\nin _my_ field? It is only as animating _that_ object, _my_ object, that\nI have any occasion to think of you at all. If the body that you actuate\nbe not the very body that I see there, but some duplicate body of your\nown with which that has nothing to do, we belong to different universes,\nyou and I, and for me to speak of you is folly. Myriads of such\nuniverses even now may coexist, irrelevant to one another; my concern is\nsolely with the universe with which my own life is connected.\nIn that perceptual part of _my_ universe which I call _your_ body, your\nmind and my mind meet and may be called conterminous. Your mind actuates\nthat body and mine sees it; my thoughts pass into it as into their\nharmonious cognitive fulfilment; your emotions and volitions pass into\nit as causes into their effects.\nBut that percept hangs together with all our other physical percepts.\nThey are of one stuff with it; and if it be our common possession, they\nmust be so likewise. For instance, your hand lays hold of one end of a\nrope and my hand lays hold of the other end. We pull against each other.\nCan our two hands be mutual objects in this experience, and the rope not\nbe mutual also? What is true of the rope is true of any other percept.\nYour objects are over and over again the same as mine. If I ask you\n_where_ some object of yours is, our old Memorial Hall, for example, you\npoint to _my_ Memorial Hall with _your_ hand which _I_ see. If you alter\nan object in your world, put out a candle, for example, when I am\npresent, _my_ candle _ipso facto_ goes out. It is only as altering my\nobjects that I guess you to exist. If your objects do not coalesce with\nmy objects, if they be not identically where mine are, they must be\nproved to be positively somewhere else. But no other location can be\nassigned for them, so their place must be what it seems to be, the\nsame.[38]\nPractically, then, our minds meet in a world of objects which they share\nin common, which would still be there, if one or several of the minds\nwere destroyed. I can see no formal objection to this supposition's\nbeing literally true. On the principles which I am defending, a 'mind'\nor 'personal consciousness' is the name for a series of experiences run\ntogether by certain definite transitions, and an objective reality is a\nseries of similar experiences knit by different transitions. If one and\nthe same experience can figure twice, once in a mental and once in a\nphysical context (as I have tried, in my article on 'Consciousness,' to\nshow that it can), one does not see why it might not figure thrice, or\nfour times, or any number of times, by running into as many different\nmental contexts, just as the same point, lying at their intersection,\ncan be continued into many different lines. Abolishing any number of\ncontexts would not destroy the experience itself or its other contexts,\nany more than abolishing some of the point's linear continuations would\ndestroy the others, or destroy the point itself.\nI well know the subtle dialectic which insists that a term taken in\nanother relation must needs be an intrinsically different term. The crux\nis always the old Greek one, that the same man can't be tall in relation\nto one neighbor, and short in relation to another, for that would make\nhim tall and short at once. In this essay I can not stop to refute this\ndialectic, so I pass on, leaving my flank for the time exposed.[39] But\nif my reader will only allow that the same '_now_' both ends his past\nand begins his future; or that, when he buys an acre of land from his\nneighbor, it is the same acre that successively figures in the two\nestates; or that when I pay him a dollar, the same dollar goes into his\npocket that came out of mine; he will also in consistency have to allow\nthat the same object may conceivably play a part in, as being related to\nthe rest of, any number of otherwise entirely different minds. This is\nenough for my present point: the common-sense notion of minds sharing\nthe same object offers no special logical or epistemological\ndifficulties of its own; it stands or falls with the general possibility\nof things being in conjunctive relation with other things at all.\nIn principle, then, let natural realism pass for possible. Your mind and\nmine _may_ terminate in the same percept, not merely against it, as if\nit were a third external thing, but by inserting themselves into it and\ncoalescing with it, for such is the sort of conjunctive union that\nappears to be experienced when a perceptual terminus 'fulfils.' Even so,\ntwo hawsers may embrace the same pile, and yet neither one of them touch\nany other part except that pile, of what the other hawser is attached\nto.\nIt is therefore not a formal question, but a question of empirical fact\nsolely, whether, when you and I are said to know the 'same' Memorial\nHall, our minds do terminate at or in a numerically identical percept.\nObviously, as a plain matter of fact, they do _not_. Apart from\ncolor-blindness and such possibilities, we see the Hall in different\nperspectives. You may be on one side of it and I on another. The percept\nof each of us, as he sees the surface of the Hall, is moreover only his\nprovisional terminus. The next thing beyond my percept is not your\nmind, but more percepts of my own into which my first percept develops,\nthe interior of the Hall, for instance, or the inner structure of its\nbricks and mortar. If our minds were in a literal sense _con_terminous,\nneither could get beyond the percept which they had in common, it would\nbe an ultimate barrier between them--unless indeed they flowed over it\nand became 'co-conscious' over a still larger part of their content,\nwhich (thought-transference apart) is not supposed to be the case. In\npoint of fact the ultimate common barrier can always be pushed, by both\nminds, farther than any actual percept of either, until at last it\nresolves itself into the mere notion of imperceptibles like atoms or\nether, so that, where we do terminate in percepts, our knowledge is only\nspeciously completed, being, in theoretic strictness, only a virtual\nknowledge of those remoter objects which conception carries out.\nIs natural realism, permissible in logic, refuted then by empirical\nfact? Do our minds have no object in common after all?\nYes, they certainly have _Space_ in common. On pragmatic principles we\nare obliged to predicate sameness wherever we can predicate no\nassignable point of difference. If two named things have every quality\nand function indiscernible, and are at the same time in the same place,\nthey must be written down as numerically one thing under two different\nnames. But there is no test discoverable, so far as I know, by which it\ncan be shown that the place occupied by your percept of Memorial Hall\ndiffers from the place occupied by mine. The percepts themselves may be\nshown to differ; but if each of us be asked to point out where his\npercept is, we point to an identical spot. All the relations, whether\ngeometrical or causal, of the Hall originate or terminate in that spot\nwherein our hands meet, and where each of us begins to work if he wishes\nto make the Hall change before the other's eyes. Just so it is with our\nbodies. That body of yours which you actuate and feel from within must\nbe in the same spot as the body of yours which I see or touch from\nwithout. 'There' for me means where I place my finger. If you do not\nfeel my finger's contact to be 'there' in _my_ sense, when I place it on\nyour body, where then do you feel it? Your inner actuations of your body\nmeet my finger _there_: it is _there_ that you resist its push, or\nshrink back, or sweep the finger aside with your hand. Whatever farther\nknowledge either of us may acquire of the real constitution of the body\nwhich we thus feel, you from within and I from without, it is in that\nsame place that the newly conceived or perceived constituents have to be\nlocated, and it is _through_ that space that your and my mental\nintercourse with each other has always to be carried on, by the\nmediation of impressions which I convey thither, and of the reactions\nthence which those impressions may provoke from you.\nIn general terms, then, whatever differing contents our minds may\neventually fill a place with, the place itself is a numerically\nidentical content of the two minds, a piece of common property in which,\nthrough which, and over which they join. The receptacle of certain of\nour experiences being thus common, the experiences themselves might some\nday become common also. If that day ever did come, our thoughts would\nterminate in a complete empirical identity, there would be an end, so\nfar as _those_ experiences went, to our discussions about truth. No\npoints of difference appearing, they would have to count as the same.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nWith this we have the outlines of a philosophy of pure experience before\nus. At the outset of my essay, I called it a mosaic philosophy. In\nactual mosaics the pieces are held together by their bedding, for which\nbedding the Substances, transcendental Egos, or Absolutes of other\nphilosophies may be taken to stand. In radical empiricism there is no\nbedding; it is as if the pieces clung together by their edges, the\ntransitions experienced between them forming their cement. Of course\nsuch a metaphor is misleading, for in actual experience the more\nsubstantive and the more transitive parts run into each other\ncontinuously, there is in general no separateness needing to be\novercome by an external cement; and whatever separateness is actually\nexperienced is not overcome, it stays and counts as separateness to the\nend. But the metaphor serves to symbolize the fact that Experience\nitself, taken at large, can grow by its edges. That one moment of it\nproliferates into the next by transitions which, whether conjunctive or\ndisjunctive, continue the experiential tissue, can not, I contend, be\ndenied. Life is in the transitions as much as in the terms connected;\noften, indeed, it seems to be there more emphatically, as if our spurts\nand sallies forward were the real firing-line of the battle, were like\nthe thin line of flame advancing across the dry autumnal field which the\nfarmer proceeds to burn. In this line we live prospectively as well as\nretrospectively. It is 'of' the past, inasmuch as it comes expressly as\nthe past's continuation; it is 'of' the future in so far as the future,\nwhen it comes, will have continued _it_.\nThese relations of continuous transition experienced are what make our\nexperiences cognitive. In the simplest and completest cases the\nexperiences are cognitive of one another. When one of them terminates a\nprevious series of them with a sense of fulfilment, it, we say, is what\nthose other experiences 'had in view.' The knowledge, in such a case, is\nverified; the truth is 'salted down.' Mainly, however, we live on\nspeculative investments, or on our prospects only. But living on things\n_in posse_ is as good as living in the actual, so long as our credit\nremains good. It is evident that for the most part it is good, and that\nthe universe seldom protests our drafts.\nIn this sense we at every moment can continue to believe in an existing\n_beyond_. It is only in special cases that our confident rush forward\ngets rebuked. The beyond must, of course, always in our philosophy be\nitself of an experiential nature. If not a future experience of our own\nor a present one of our neighbor, it must be a thing in itself in Dr.\nPrince's and Professor Strong's sense of the term--that is, it must be\nan experience _for_ itself whose relation to other things we translate\ninto the action of molecules, ether-waves, or whatever else the\nphysical symbols may be.[40] This opens the chapter of the relations of\nradical empiricism to panpsychism, into which I can not enter now.[41]\nThe beyond can in any case exist simultaneously--for it can be\nexperienced _to have existed_ simultaneously--with the experience that\npractically postulates it by looking in its direction, or by turning or\nchanging in the direction of which it is the goal. Pending that\nactuality of union, in the virtuality of which the 'truth,' even now, of\nthe postulation consists, the beyond and its knower are entities split\noff from each other. The world is in so far forth a pluralism of which\nthe unity is not fully experienced as yet. But, as fast as verifications\ncome, trains of experience, once separate, run into one another; and\nthat is why I said, earlier in my article, that the unity of the world\nis on the whole undergoing increase. The universe continually grows in\nquantity by new experiences that graft themselves upon the older mass;\nbut these very new experiences often help the mass to a more\nconsolidated form.\nThese are the main features of a philosophy of pure experience. It has\ninnumerable other aspects and arouses innumerable questions, but the\npoints I have touched on seem enough to make an entering wedge. In my\nown mind such a philosophy harmonizes best with a radical pluralism,\nwith novelty and indeterminism, moralism and theism, and with the\n'humanism' lately sprung upon us by the Oxford and the Chicago\nschools.[42] I can not, however, be sure that all these doctrines are\nits necessary and indispensable allies. It presents so many points of\ndifference, both from the common sense and from the idealism that have\nmade our philosophic language, that it is almost as difficult to state\nit as it is to think it out clearly, and if it is ever to grow into a\nrespectable system, it will have to be built up by the contributions of\nmany co-operating minds. It seems to me, as I said at the outset of this\nessay, that many minds are, in point of fact, now turning in a direction\nthat points towards radical empiricism. If they are carried farther by\nmy words, and if then they add their stronger voices to my feebler one,\nthe publication of this essay will have been worth while.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[25] [Reprinted from the _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Cf. also \"Humanism and Truth Once\nMore,\" below, pp. 244-265.]\nIII\nTHE THING AND ITS RELATIONS[43]\nExperience in its immediacy seems perfectly fluent. The active sense of\nliving which we all enjoy, before reflection shatters our instinctive\nworld for us, is self-luminous and suggests no paradoxes. Its\ndifficulties are disappointments and uncertainties. They are not\nintellectual contradictions.\nWhen the reflective intellect gets at work, however, it discovers\nincomprehensibilities in the flowing process. Distinguishing its\nelements and parts, it gives them separate names, and what it thus\ndisjoins it can not easily put together. Pyrrhonism accepts the\nirrationality and revels in its dialectic elaboration. Other\nphilosophies try, some by ignoring, some by resisting, and some by\nturning the dialectic procedure against itself, negating its first\nnegations, to restore the fluent sense of life again, and let redemption\ntake the place of innocence. The perfection with which any philosophy\nmay do this is the measure of its human success and of its importance in\nphilosophic history. In [the last essay], 'A World of Pure Experience,'\nI tried my own hand sketchily at the problem, resisting certain first\nsteps of dialectics by insisting in a general way that the immediately\nexperienced conjunctive relations are as real as anything else. If my\nsketch is not to appear too _na\u00eff_, I must come closer to details, and\nin the present essay I propose to do so.\nI\n'Pure experience' is the name which I gave to the immediate flux of life\nwhich furnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual\ncategories. Only new-born babes, or men in semi-coma from sleep, drugs,\nillnesses, or blows, may be assumed to have an experience pure in the\nliteral sense of a _that_ which is not yet any definite _what_, tho'\nready to be all sorts of whats; full both of oneness and of manyness,\nbut in respects that don't appear; changing throughout, yet so\nconfusedly that its phases interpenetrate and no points, either of\ndistinction or of identity, can be caught. Pure experience in this state\nis but another name for feeling or sensation. But the flux of it no\nsooner comes than it tends to fill itself with emphases, and these\nsalient parts become identified and fixed and abstracted; so that\nexperience now flows as if shot through with adjectives and nouns and\nprepositions and conjunctions. Its purity is only a relative term,\nmeaning the proportional amount of unverbalized sensation which it still\nembodies.\nFar back as we go, the flux, both as a whole and in its parts, is that\nof things conjunct and separated. The great continua of time, space, and\nthe self envelope everything, betwixt them, and flow together without\ninterfering. The things that they envelope come as separate in some ways\nand as continuous in others. Some sensations coalesce with some ideas,\nand others are irreconcilable. Qualities compenetrate one space, or\nexclude each other from it. They cling together persistently in groups\nthat move as units, or else they separate. Their changes are abrupt or\ndiscontinuous; and their kinds resemble or differ; and, as they do so,\nthey fall into either even or irregular series.\nIn all this the continuities and the discontinuities are absolutely\nco-ordinate matters of immediate feeling. The conjunctions are as\nprimordial elements of 'fact' as are the distinctions and disjunctions.\nIn the same act by which I feel that this passing minute is a new pulse\nof my life, I feel that the old life continues into it, and the feeling\nof continuance in no wise jars upon the simultaneous feeling of a\nnovelty. They, too, compenetrate harmoniously. Prepositions, copulas,\nand conjunctions, 'is,' 'isn't,' 'then,' 'before,' 'in,' 'on,' 'beside,'\n'between,' 'next,' 'like,' 'unlike,' 'as,' 'but,' flower out of the\nstream of pure experience, the stream of concretes or the sensational\nstream, as naturally as nouns and adjectives do, and they melt into it\nagain as fluidly when we apply them to a new portion of the stream.\nII\nIf now we ask why we must thus translate experience from a more concrete\nor pure into a more intellectualized form, filling it with ever more\nabounding conceptual distinctions, rationalism and naturalism give\ndifferent replies.\nThe rationalistic answer is that the theoretic life is absolute and its\ninterests imperative; that to understand is simply the duty of man; and\nthat who questions this need not be argued with, for by the fact of\narguing he gives away his case.\nThe naturalist answer is that the environment kills as well as sustains\nus, and that the tendency of raw experience to extinguish the experient\nhimself is lessened just in the degree in which the elements in it that\nhave a practical bearing upon life are analyzed out of the continuum and\nverbally fixed and coupled together, so that we may know what is in the\nwind for us and get ready to react in time. Had pure experience, the\nnaturalist says, been always perfectly healthy, there would never have\narisen the necessity of isolating or verbalizing any of its terms. We\nshould just have experienced inarticulately and unintellectually\nenjoyed. This leaning on 'reaction' in the naturalist account implies\nthat, whenever we intellectualize a relatively pure experience, we ought\nto do so for the sake of redescending to the purer or more concrete\nlevel again; and that if an intellect stays aloft among its abstract\nterms and generalized relations, and does not reinsert itself with its\nconclusions into some particular point of the immediate stream of life,\nit fails to finish out its function and leaves its normal race unrun.\nMost rationalists nowadays will agree that naturalism gives a true\nenough account of the way in which our intellect arose at first, but\nthey will deny these latter implications. The case, they will say,\nresembles that of sexual love. Originating in the animal need of getting\nanother generation born, this passion has developed secondarily such\nimperious spiritual needs that, if you ask why another generation ought\nto be born at all, the answer is: 'Chiefly that love may go on.' Just\nso with our intellect: it originated as a practical means of serving\nlife; but it has developed incidentally the function of understanding\nabsolute truth; and life itself now seems to be given chiefly as a means\nby which that function may be prosecuted. But truth and the\nunderstanding of it lie among the abstracts and universals, so the\nintellect now carries on its higher business wholly in this region,\nwithout any need of redescending into pure experience again.\nIf the contrasted tendencies which I thus designate as naturalistic and\nrationalistic are not recognized by the reader, perhaps an example will\nmake them more concrete. Mr. Bradley, for instance, is an\nultra-rationalist. He admits that our intellect is primarily practical,\nbut says that, for philosophers, the practical need is simply Truth.\nTruth, moreover, must be assumed 'consistent.' Immediate experience has\nto be broken into subjects and qualities, terms and relations, to be\nunderstood as truth at all. Yet when so broken it is less consistent\nthan ever. Taken raw, it is all un-distinguished. Intellectualized, it\nis all distinction without oneness. 'Such an arrangement may _work_, but\nthe theoretic problem is not solved.' The question is '_how_ the\ndiversity can exist in harmony with the oneness.' To go back to pure\nexperience is unavailing. 'Mere feeling gives no answer to our riddle.'\nEven if your intuition is a fact, it is not an _understanding_. 'It is a\nmere experience, and furnishes no consistent view.' The experience\noffered as facts or truths 'I find that my intellect rejects because\nthey contradict themselves. They offer a complex of diversities\nconjoined in a way which it feels is not its way and which it can not\nrepeat as its own.... For to be satisfied, my intellect must understand,\nand it can not understand by taking a congeries in the lump.'[44] So Mr.\nBradley, in the sole interests of 'understanding' (as he conceives that\nfunction), turns his back on finite experience forever. Truth must lie\nin the opposite direction, the direction of the Absolute; and this kind\nof rationalism and naturalism, or (as I will now call it) pragmatism,\nwalk thenceforward upon opposite paths. For the one, those intellectual\nproducts are most true which, turning their face towards the Absolute,\ncome nearest to symbolizing its ways of uniting the many and the one.\nFor the other, those are most true which most successfully dip back into\nthe finite stream of feeling and grow most easily confluent with some\nparticular wave or wavelet. Such confluence not only proves the\nintellectual operation to have been true (as an addition may 'prove'\nthat a subtraction is already rightly performed), but it constitutes,\naccording to pragmatism, all that we mean by calling it true. Only in so\nfar as they lead us, successfully or unsuccessfully, back into sensible\nexperience again, are our abstracts and universals true or false at\nall.[45]\nIII\nIn Section VI of [the last essay], I adopted in a general way the\ncommon-sense belief that one and the same world is cognized by our\ndifferent minds; but I left undiscussed the dialectical arguments which\nmaintain that this is logically absurd. The usual reason given for its\nbeing absurd is that it assumes one object (to wit, the world) to stand\nin two relations at once; to my mind, namely, and again to yours;\nwhereas a term taken in a second relation can not logically be the same\nterm which it was at first.\nI have heard this reason urged so often in discussing with absolutists,\nand it would destroy my radical empiricism so utterly, if it were valid,\nthat I am bound to give it an attentive ear, and seriously to search its\nstrength.\nFor instance, let the matter in dispute be term _M_, asserted to be on\nthe one hand related to _L_, and on the other to _N_; and let the two\ncases of relation be symbolized by _L--M_ and _M--N_ respectively. When,\nnow, I assume that the experience may immediately come and be given in\nthe shape _L--M--N_, with no trace of doubling or internal fission in\nthe _M_, I am told that this is all a popular delusion; that _L--M--N_\nlogically means two different experiences, _L--M_ and _M--N_, namely;\nand that although the Absolute may, and indeed must, from its superior\npoint of view, read its own kind of unity into _M_'s two editions, yet\nas elements in finite experience the two _M_'s lie irretrievably\nasunder, and the world between them is broken and unbridged.\nIn arguing this dialectic thesis, one must avoid slipping from the\nlogical into the physical point of view. It would be easy, in taking a\nconcrete example to fix one's ideas by, to choose one in which the\nletter _M_ should stand for a collective noun of some sort, which noun,\nbeing related to _L_ by one of its parts and to _N_ by another, would\ninwardly be two things when it stood outwardly in both relations. Thus,\none might say: 'David Hume, who weighed so many stone by his body,\ninfluences posterity by his doctrine.' The body and the doctrine are two\nthings, between which our finite minds can discover no real sameness,\nthough the same name covers both of them. And then, one might continue:\n'Only an Absolute is capable of uniting such a non-identity.' We must, I\nsay, avoid this sort of example, for the dialectic insight, if true at\nall, must apply to terms and relations universally. It must be true of\nabstract units as well as of nouns collective; and if we prove it by\nconcrete examples we must take the simplest, so as to avoid irrelevant\nmaterial suggestions.\nTaken thus in all its generality, the absolutist contention seems to use\nas its major premise Hume's notion 'that all our distinct perceptions\nare distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives any real\nconnexion among distinct existences.'[46] Undoubtedly, since we use two\nphrases in talking first about '_M_'s relation to _L_' and then about\n'_M_'s relation to _N_,' we must be having, or must have had, two\ndistinct perceptions;--and the rest would then seem to follow duly. But\nthe starting-point of the reasoning here seems to be the fact of the two\n_phrases_; and this suggests that the argument may be merely verbal. Can\nit be that the whole dialectic consists in attributing to the experience\ntalked-about a constitution similar to that of the language in which we\ndescribe it? Must we assert the objective double-ness of the _M_ merely\nbecause we have to name it twice over when we name its two relations?\nCandidly, I can think of no other reason than this for the dialectic\nconclusion;[47] for, if we think, not of our words, but of any simple\nconcrete matter which they may be held to signify, the experience itself\nbelies the paradox asserted. We use indeed two separate concepts in\nanalyzing our object, but we know them all the while to be but\nsubstitutional, and that the _M_ in _L--M_ and the _M_ in _M--N mean_\n(_i.e._, are capable of leading to and terminating in) one self-same\npiece, _M_, of sensible experience. This persistent identity of certain\nunits (or emphases, or points, or objects, or members--call them what\nyou will) of the experience-continuum, is just one of those conjunctive\nfeatures of it, on which I am obliged to insist so emphatically.[48] For\nsamenesses are parts of experience's indefeasible structure. When I hear\na bell-stroke and, as life flows on, its after image dies away, I still\nhark back to it as 'that same bell-stroke.' When I see a thing _M_, with\n_L_ to the left of it and _N_ to the right of it, I see it _as_ one _M_;\nand if you tell me I have had to 'take' it twice, I reply that if I\n'took' it a thousand times I should still _see_ it as a unit.[49] Its\nunity is aboriginal, just as the multiplicity of my successive takings\nis aboriginal. It comes unbroken as _that M_, as a singular which I\nencounter; they come broken, as _those_ takings, as my plurality of\noperations. The unity and the separateness are strictly co-ordinate. I\ndo not easily fathom why my opponents should find the separateness so\nmuch more easily understandable that they must needs infect the whole of\nfinite experience with it, and relegate the unity (now taken as a bare\npostulate and no longer as a thing positively perceivable) to the region\nof the Absolute's mysteries. I do not easily fathom this, I say, for the\nsaid opponents are above mere verbal quibbling; yet all that I can catch\nin their talk is the substitution of what is true of certain words for\nwhat is true of what they signify. They stay with the words,--not\nreturning to the stream of life whence all the meaning of them came, and\nwhich is always ready to reabsorb them.\nIV\nFor aught this argument proves, then, we may continue to believe that\none thing can be known by many knowers. But the denial of one thing in\nmany relations is but one application of a still profounder dialectic\ndifficulty. Man can't be good, said the sophists, for man is _man_ and\n_good_ is good; and Hegel[50] and Herbart in their day, more recently A.\nSpir,[51] and most recently and elaborately of all, Mr. Bradley, informs\nus that a term can logically only be a punctiform unit, and that not one\nof the conjunctive relations between things, which experience seems to\nyield, is rationally possible.\nOf course, if true, this cuts off radical empiricism without even a\nshilling. Radical empiricism takes conjunctive relations at their face\nvalue, holding them to be as real as the terms united by them.[52] The\nworld it represents as a collection, some parts of which are\nconjunctively and others disjunctively related. Two parts, themselves\ndisjoined, may nevertheless hang together by intermediaries with which\nthey are severally connected, and the whole world eventually may hang\ntogether similarly, inasmuch as _some_ path of conjunctive transition by\nwhich to pass from one of its parts to another may always be\ndiscernible. Such determinately various hanging-together may be called\n_concatenated_ union, to distinguish it from the 'through-and-through'\ntype of union, 'each in all and all in each' (union of _total conflux_,\nas one might call it), which monistic systems hold to obtain when things\nare taken in their absolute reality. In a concatenated world a partial\nconflux often is experienced. Our concepts and our sensations are\nconfluent; successive states of the same ego, and feelings of the same\nbody are confluent. Where the experience is not of conflux, it may be of\nconterminousness (things with but one thing between); or of\ncontiguousness (nothing between); or of likeness; or of nearness; or of\nsimultaneousness; or of in-ness; or of on-ness; or of for-ness; or of\nsimple with-ness; or even of mere and-ness, which last relation would\nmake of however disjointed a world otherwise, at any rate for that\noccasion a universe 'of discourse.' Now Mr. Bradley tells us that none\nof these relations, as we actually experience them, can possibly be\nreal.[53] My next duty, accordingly, must be to rescue radical\nempiricism from Mr. Bradley. Fortunately, as it seems to me, his general\ncontention, that the very notion of relation is unthinkable clearly, has\nbeen successfully met by many critics.[54]\nIt is a burden to the flesh, and an injustice both to readers and to\nthe previous writers, to repeat good arguments already printed. So, in\nnoticing Mr. Bradley, I will confine myself to the interests of radical\nempiricism solely.\nV\nThe first duty of radical empiricism, taking given conjunctions at their\nface-value, is to class some of them as more intimate and some as more\nexternal. When two terms are _similar_, their very natures enter into\nthe relation. Being _what_ they are, no matter where or when, the\nlikeness never can be denied, if asserted. It continues predicable as\nlong as the terms continue. Other relations, the _where_ and the _when_,\nfor example, seem adventitious. The sheet of paper may be 'off' or 'on'\nthe table, for example; and in either case the relation involves only\nthe outside of its terms. Having an outside, both of them, they\ncontribute by it to the relation. It is external: the term's inner\nnature is irrelevant to it. Any book, any table, may fall into the\nrelation, which is created _pro hac vice_, not by their existence, but\nby their casual situation. It is just because so many of the\nconjunctions of experience seem so external that a philosophy of pure\nexperience must tend to pluralism in its ontology. So far as things have\nspace-relations, for example, we are free to imagine them with different\norigins even. If they could get to _be_, and get into space at all, then\nthey may have done so separately. Once there, however, they are\n_additives_ to one another, and, with no prejudice to their natures, all\nsorts of space-relations may supervene between them. The question of\nhow things could come to be anyhow, is wholly different from the\nquestion what their relations, once the being accomplished, may consist\nin.\nMr. Bradley now affirms that such external relations as the\nspace-relations which we here talk of must hold of entirely different\nsubjects from those of which the absence of such relations might a\nmoment previously have been plausibly asserted. Not only is the\n_situation_ different when the book is on the table, but the _book\nitself_ is different as a book, from what it was when it was off the\ntable.[55] He admits that \"such external relations seem possible and\neven existing.... That you do not alter what you compare or rearrange in\nspace seems to common sense quite obvious, and that on the other side\nthere are as obvious difficulties does not occur to common sense at all.\nAnd I will begin by pointing out these difficulties.... There is a\nrelation in the result, and this relation, we hear, is to make no\ndifference in its terms. But, if so, to what does it make a difference?\n[_Doesn't it make a difference to us onlookers, at least?_] and what is\nthe meaning and sense of qualifying the terms by it? [_Surely the\nmeaning is to tell the truth about their relative position._[56]] If, in\nshort, it is external to the terms, how can it possibly be true of them?\n[_Is it the 'intimacy' suggested by the little word 'of,' here, which I\nhave underscored, that is the root of Mr. Bradley's trouble?_] ... If\nthe terms from their inner nature do not enter into the relation, then,\nso far as they are concerned, they seem related for no reason at all....\nThings are spatially related, first in one way, and then become related\nin another way, and yet in no way themselves are altered; for the\nrelations, it is said, are but external. But I reply that, if so, I can\nnot _understand_ the leaving by the terms of one set of relations and\ntheir adoption of another fresh set. The process and its result to the\nterms, if they contribute nothing to it [_Surely they contribute to it\nall there is 'of' it!_] seem irrational throughout. [_If 'irrational'\nhere means simply 'non-rational,' or nondeductible from the essence of\neither term singly, it is no reproach; if it means 'contradicting' such\nessence, Mr. Bradley should show wherein and how._] But, if they\ncontribute anything, they must surely be affected internally. [_Why so,\nif they contribute only their surface? In such relations as 'on' 'a foot\naway,' 'between,' 'next,' etc., only surfaces are in question._] ... If\nthe terms contribute anything whatever, then the terms are affected\n[_inwardly altered?_] by the arrangement.... That for working purposes\nwe treat, and do well to treat, some relations as external merely I do\nnot deny, and that of course is not the question at issue here. That\nquestion is ... whether in the end and in principle a mere external\nrelation [_i.e., a relation which can change without forcing its terms\nto change their nature simultaneously_] is possible and forced on us by\nthe facts.\"[57]\nMr. Bradley next reverts to the antinomies of space, which, according to\nhim, prove it to be unreal, although it appears as so prolific a medium\nof external relations; and he then concludes that \"Irrationality and\nexternality can not be the last truth about things. Somewhere there must\nbe a reason why this and that appear together. And this reason and\nreality must reside in the whole from which terms and relations are\nabstractions, a whole in which their internal connection must lie, and\nout of which from the background appear those fresh results which never\ncould have come from the premises.\" And he adds that \"Where the whole is\ndifferent, the terms that qualify and contribute to it must so far be\ndifferent.... They are altered so far only [_How far? farther than\nexternally, yet not through and through?_] but still they are\naltered.... I must insist that in each case the terms are qualified by\ntheir whole [_Qualified how?--Do their external relations, situations,\ndates, etc., changed as these are in the new whole, fail to qualify them\n'far' enough?_], and that in the second case there is a whole which\ndiffers both logically and psychologically from the first whole; and I\nurge that in contributing to the change the terms so far are altered.\"\nNot merely the relations, then, but the terms are altered: _und zwar_ 'so\nfar.' But just _how_ far is the whole problem; and 'through-and-through'\nwould seem (in spite of Mr. Bradley's somewhat undecided utterances[58])\nto be the full Bradleyan answer. The 'whole' which he here treats as\nprimary and determinative of each part's manner of 'contributing,' simply\n_must_, when it alters, alter in its entirety. There _must_ be total\nconflux of its parts, each into and through each other. The 'must' appears\nhere as a _Machtspruch_, as an _ipse dixit_ of Mr. Bradley's\nabsolutistically tempered 'understanding,' for he candidly confesses that\nhow the parts _do_ differ as they contribute to different wholes, is\nunknown to him.[59]\nAlthough I have every wish to comprehend the authority by which Mr.\nBradley's understanding speaks, his words leave me wholly unconverted.\n'External relations' stand with their withers all unwrung, and remain,\nfor aught he proves to the contrary, not only practically workable, but\nalso perfectly intelligible factors of reality.\nVI\nMr. Bradley's understanding shows the most extraordinary power of\nperceiving separations and the most extraordinary impotence in\ncomprehending conjunctions. One would naturally say 'neither or both,'\nbut not so Mr. Bradley. When a common man analyzes certain _whats_ from\nout the stream of experience, he understands their distinctness _as thus\nisolated_. But this does not prevent him from equally well understanding\ntheir combination with each other _as originally experienced in the\nconcrete_, or their confluence with new sensible experiences in which\nthey recur as 'the same.' Returning into the stream of sensible\npresentation, nouns and adjectives, and _thats_ and abstract _whats_,\ngrow confluent again, and the word 'is' names all these experiences of\nconjunction. Mr. Bradley understands the isolation of the abstracts, but\nto understand the combination is to him impossible.[60] \"To understand\na complex _AB_,\" he says, \"I must begin with _A_ or _B_. And beginning,\nsay with _A_, if I then merely find _B_, I have either lost _A_, or I\nhave got beside _A_, [_the word 'beside' seems here vital, as meaning a\nconjunction 'external' and therefore unintelligible_] something else,\nand in neither case have I understood.[61] For my intellect can not\nsimply unite a diversity, nor has it in itself any form or way of\ntogetherness, and you gain nothing if, beside _A_ and _B_, you offer me\ntheir conjunction in fact. For to my intellect that is no more than\nanother external element. And 'facts,' once for all, are for my\nintellect not true unless they satisfy it.... The intellect has in its\nnature no principle of mere togetherness.\"[62]\nOf course Mr. Bradley has a right to define 'intellect' as the power by\nwhich we perceive separations but not unions--provided he give due\nnotice to the reader. But why then claim that such a maimed and\namputated power must reign supreme in philosophy, and accuse on its\nbehoof the whole empirical world of irrationality? It is true that he\nelsewhere attributes to the intellect a _proprius motus_ of transition,\nbut says that when he looks for _these_ transitions in the detail of\nliving experience, he 'is unable to verify such a solution.'[63]\nYet he never explains what the intellectual transitions would be like in\ncase we had them. He only defines them negatively--they are not spatial,\ntemporal, predicative, or causal; or qualitatively or otherwise serial;\nor in any way relational as we na\u00efvely trace relations, for relations\n_separate_ terms, and need themselves to be hooked on _ad infinitum_.\nThe nearest approach he makes to describing a truly intellectual\ntransition is where he speaks of _A_ and _B_ as being 'united, each\nfrom its own nature, in a whole which is the nature of both alike.'[64]\nBut this (which, _pace_ Mr. Bradley, seems exquisitely analogous to\n'taking' a congeries in a 'lump,' if not to 'swamping') suggests nothing\nbut that _conflux_ which pure experience so abundantly offers, as when\n'space,' 'white' and 'sweet' are confluent in a 'lump of sugar,' or\nkinesthetic, dermal, and optical sensations confluent in 'my hand.'[65]\nAll that I can verify in the transitions which Mr. Bradley's intellect\ndesiderates as its _proprius motus_ is a reminiscence of these and other\nsensible conjunctions (especially space-conjunctions), but a\nreminiscence so vague that its originals are not recognized. Bradley in\nshort repeats the fable of the dog, the bone, and its image in the\nwater. With a world of particulars, given in loveliest union, in\nconjunction definitely various, and variously definite, the 'how' of\nwhich you 'understand' as soon as you see the fact of them,[66] for\nthere is no 'how' except the constitution of the fact as given; with all\nthis given him, I say, in pure experience, he asks for some ineffable\nunion in the abstract instead, which, if he gained it, would only be a\nduplicate of what he has already in his full possession. Surely he\nabuses the privilege which society grants to all us philosophers, of\nbeing puzzle-headed.\nPolemic writing like this is odious; but with absolutism in possession\nin so many quarters, omission to defend my radical empiricism against\nits best known champion would count as either superficiality or\ninability. I have to conclude that its dialectic has not invalidated in\nthe least degree the usual conjunctions by which the world, as\nexperienced, hangs so variously together. In particular it leaves an\nempirical theory of knowledge[67] intact, and lets us continue to\nbelieve with common sense that one object _may_ be known, if we have any\nground for thinking that it _is_ known, to many knowers.\nIn [the next essay] I shall return to this last supposition, which\nseems to me to offer other difficulties much harder for a philosophy of\npure experience to deal with than any of absolutism's dialectic\nobjections.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[43] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Bradley: _Appearance and Reality_, second edition, pp.\n152-153, 23, 118, 104, 108-109, 570.]\n[45] Compare Professor MacLennan's admirable _Auseinandersetzung_ with\nMr. Bradley, in _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific\nMethods_, vol. I, [1904], pp. 403 ff., especially pp. 405-407.\n[46] [Hume: _Treatise of Human Nature_, Appendix, Selby-Bigge's edition,\np. 636.]\n[47] Technically, it seems classable as a 'fallacy of composition.' A\nduality, predicable of the two wholes, _L--M_ and _M--N_, is forthwith\npredicated of one of their parts, _M_.\n[48] See above, pp. 42 ff.\n[49] I may perhaps refer here to my _Principles of Psychology_, vol. I,\npp. 459 ff. It really seems 'weird' to have to argue (as I am forced now\nto do) for the notion that it is one sheet of paper (with its two\nsurfaces and all that lies between) which is both under my pen and on\nthe table while I write--the 'claim' that it is two sheets seems so\nbrazen. Yet I sometimes suspect the absolutists of sincerity!\n[50] [For the author's criticism of Hegel's view of relations, cf. _Will\nto Believe_, pp. 278-279. ED.]\n[51] [Cf. A. Spir: _Denken und Wirklichkeit_, part I, bk. III, ch. IV\n(containing also account of Herbart). ED.]\n[52] [See above, pp. 42, 49.]\n[53] Here again the reader must beware of slipping from logical into\nphenomenal considerations. It may well be that we _attribute_ a certain\nrelation falsely, because the circumstances of the case, being complex,\nhave deceived us. At a railway station we may take our own train, and\nnot the one that fills our window, to be moving. We here put motion in\nthe wrong place in the world, but in its original place the motion is a\npart of reality. What Mr. Bradley means is nothing like this, but rather\nthat such things as motion are nowhere real, and that, even in their\naboriginal and empirically incorrigible seats, relations are impossible\nof comprehension.\n[54] Particularly so by Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, in his _Man and\nthe Cosmos_; by L. T. Hobhouse, in chapter XII (\"The Validity of\nJudgment\") of his _Theory of Knowledge_; and by F. C. S. Schiller, in\nhis _Humanism_, essay XI. Other fatal reviews (in my opinion) are\nHodder's, in the _Psychological Review_, vol. I, [1894], p. 307; Stout's\nin the _Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society_, 1901-2, p. 1; and\nMacLennan's in [_The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific\nMethods_, vol. I, 1904, p. 403].\n[55] Once more, don't slip from logical into physical situations. Of\ncourse, if the table be wet, it will moisten the book, or if it be\nslight enough and the book heavy enough, the book will break it down.\nBut such collateral phenomena are not the point at issue. The point is\nwhether the successive relations 'on' and 'not-on' can rationally (not\nphysically) hold of the same constant terms, abstractly taken. Professor\nA. E. Taylor drops from logical into material considerations when he\ninstances color-contrast as a proof that _A_, 'as contra-distinguished\nfrom _B_, is not the same thing as mere _A_ not in any way affected'\n(_Elements of Metaphysics_, p. 145). Note the substitution, for\n'related' of the word 'affected,' which begs the whole question.\n[56] But \"is there any sense,\" asks Mr. Bradley, peevishly, on p. 579,\n\"and if so, what sense in truth that is only outside and 'about'\nthings?\" Surely such a question may be left unanswered.\n[57] _Appearance and Reality_, second edition, pp. 575-576.\n[58] I say 'undecided,' because, apart from the 'so far,' which sounds\nterribly half-hearted, there are passages in these very pages in which\nMr. Bradley admits the pluralistic thesis. Read, for example, what he\nsays, on p. 578, of a billiard ball keeping its 'character' unchanged,\nthough, in its change of place, its 'existence' gets altered; or what\nhe says, on p. 579, of the possibility that an abstract quality A, B,\nor C, in a thing, 'may throughout remain unchanged' although the thing\nbe altered; or his admission that in red-hairedness, both as analyzed\nout of a man and when given with the rest of him, there may be 'no\nchange' (p. 580). Why does he immediately add that for the pluralist\nto plead the non-mutation of such abstractions would be an _ignoratio\nelenchi_? It is impossible to admit it to be such. The entire\n_elenchus_ and inquest is just as to whether parts which you can\nabstract from existing wholes can also contribute to other wholes\nwithout changing their inner nature. If they can thus mould various\nwholes into new _gestaltqualit\u00e4ten_, then it follows that the same\nelements are logically able to exist in different wholes [whether\nphysically able would depend on additional hypotheses]; that partial\nchanges are thinkable, and through-and-through change not a dialectic\nnecessity; that monism is only an hypothesis; and that an additively\nconstituted universe is a rationally respectable hypothesis also. All\nthe theses of radical empiricism, in short, follow.\n[59] _Op. cit._, pp. 577-579.\n[60] So far as I catch his state of mind, it is somewhat like this:\n'Book,' 'table,' 'on'--how does the existence of these three abstract\nelements result in _this_ book being livingly on _this_ table. Why isn't\nthe table on the book? Or why doesn't the 'on' connect itself with\nanother book, or something that is not a table? Mustn't something _in_\neach of the three elements already determine the two others to _it_, so\nthat they do not settle elsewhere or float vaguely? Mustn't the _whole\nfact be pre-figured in each part_, and exist _de jure_ before it can\nexist _de facto_? But, if so, in what can the jural existence consist,\nif not in a spiritual miniature of the whole fact's constitution\nactuating every partial factor as its purpose? But is this anything but\nthe old metaphysical fallacy of looking behind a fact _in esse_ for the\nground of the fact, and finding it in the shape of the very same fact\n_in posse_? Somewhere we must leave off with a _constitution_ behind\nwhich there is nothing.\n[61] Apply this to the case of 'book-on-table'! W. J.\n[62] _Op. cit._, pp. 570, 572.\n[63] _Op. cit._, pp. 568, 569.\n[64] _Op. cit._, p. 570.\n[65] How meaningless is the contention that in such wholes (or in\n'book-on-table,' 'watch-in-pocket,' etc.) the relation is an additional\nentity _between_ the terms, needing itself to be related again to each!\nBoth Bradley (_op. cit._, pp. 32-33) and Royce (_The World and the\nIndividual_, vol. I, p. 128) lovingly repeat this piece of profundity.\n[66] The 'why' and the 'whence' are entirely other questions, not under\ndiscussion, as I understand Mr. Bradley. Not how experience gets itself\nborn, but how it can be what it is after it is born, is the puzzle.\n[67] Above, p. 52.\nIV\nHOW TWO MINDS CAN KNOW ONE THING[68]\nIn [the essay] entitled 'Does Consciousness Exist?' I have tried to show\nthat when we call an experience 'conscious,' that does not mean that it\nis suffused throughout with a peculiar modality of being ('psychic'\nbeing) as stained glass may be suffused with light, but rather that it\nstands in certain determinate relations to other portions of experience\nextraneous to itself. These form one peculiar 'context' for it; while,\ntaken in another context of experiences, we class it as a fact in the\nphysical world. This 'pen,' for example, is, in the first instance, a\nbald _that_, a datum, fact, phenomenon, content, or whatever other\nneutral or ambiguous name you may prefer to apply. I called it in that\narticle a 'pure experience.' To get classed either as a physical pen or\nas some one's percept of a pen, it must assume a _function_, and that\ncan only happen in a more complicated world. So far as in that world it\nis a stable feature, holds ink, marks paper and obeys the guidance of a\nhand, it is a physical pen. That is what we mean by being 'physical,' in\na pen. So far as it is instable, on the contrary, coming and going with\nthe movements of my eyes, altering with what I call my fancy, continuous\nwith subsequent experiences of its 'having been' (in the past tense), it\nis the percept of a pen in my mind. Those peculiarities are what we mean\nby being 'conscious,' in a pen.\nIn Section VI of another [essay][69] I tried to show that the same\n_that_, the same numerically identical pen of pure experience, can enter\nsimultaneously into many conscious contexts, or, in other words, be an\nobject for many different minds. I admitted that I had not space to\ntreat of certain possible objections in that article; but in [the last\nessay] I took some of the objections up. At the end of that [essay] I\nsaid that still more formidable-sounding objections remained; so, to\nleave my pure-experience theory in as strong a state as possible, I\npropose to consider those objections now.\nI\nThe objections I previously tried to dispose of were purely logical or\ndialectical. No one identical term, whether physical or psychical, it\nhad been said, could be the subject of two relations at once. This\nthesis I sought to prove unfounded. The objections that now confront us\narise from the nature supposed to inhere in psychic facts specifically.\nWhatever may be the case with physical objects, a fact of consciousness,\nit is alleged (and indeed very plausibly), can not, without\nself-contradiction, be treated as a portion of two different minds, and\nfor the following reasons.\nIn the physical world we make with impunity the assumption that one and\nthe same material object can figure in an indefinitely large number of\ndifferent processes at once. When, for instance, a sheet of rubber is\npulled at its four corners, a unit of rubber in the middle of the sheet\nis affected by all four of the pulls. It _transmits_ them each, as if\nit pulled in four different ways at once itself. So, an air-particle or\nan ether-particle 'compounds' the different directions of movement\nimprinted on it without obliterating their several individualities. It\ndelivers them distinct, on the contrary, at as many several 'receivers'\n(ear, eye or what not) as may be 'tuned' to that effect. The apparent\nparadox of a distinctness like this surviving in the midst of\ncompounding is a thing which, I fancy, the analyses made by physicists\nhave by this time sufficiently cleared up.\nBut if, on the strength of these analogies, one should ask: \"Why, if two\nor more lines can run through one and the same geometrical point, or if\ntwo or more distinct processes of activity can run through one and the\nsame physical thing so that it simultaneously plays a r\u00f4le in each and\nevery process, might not two or more streams of personal consciousness\ninclude one and the same unit of experience so that it would\nsimultaneously be a part of the experience of all the different minds?\"\none would be checked by thinking of a certain peculiarity by which\nphenomena of consciousness differ from physical things.\nWhile physical things, namely, are supposed to be permanent and to have\ntheir 'states,' a fact of consciousness exists but once and _is_ a\nstate. Its _esse_ is _sentiri_; it is only so far as it is felt; and it\nis unambiguously and unequivocally exactly _what_ is felt. The\nhypothesis under consideration would, however, oblige it to be felt\nequivocally, felt now as part of my mind and again at the same time\n_not_ as a part of my mind, but of yours (for my mind is _not_ yours),\nand this would seem impossible without doubling it into two distinct\nthings, or, in other words, without reverting to the ordinary dualistic\nphilosophy of insulated minds each knowing its object representatively\nas a third thing,--and that would be to give up the pure-experience\nscheme altogether.\nCan we see, then, any way in which a unit of pure experience might enter\ninto and figure in two diverse streams of consciousness without turning\nitself into the two units which, on our hypothesis, it must not be?\nII\nThere is a way; and the first step towards it is to see more precisely\nhow the unit enters into either one of the streams of consciousness\nalone. Just what, from being 'pure,' does its becoming 'conscious'\n_once_ mean?\nIt means, first, that new experiences have supervened; and, second, that\nthey have borne a certain assignable relation to the unit supposed.\nContinue, if you please, to speak of the pure unit as 'the pen.' So far\nas the pen's successors do but repeat the pen or, being different from\nit, are 'energetically'[70] related to it, it and they will form a group\nof stably existing physical things. So far, however, as its successors\ndiffer from it in another well-determined way, the pen will figure in\ntheir context, not as a physical, but as a mental fact. It will become a\npassing 'percept,' _my_ percept of that pen. What now is that decisive\nwell-determined way?\nIn the chapter on 'The Self,' in my _Principles of Psychology_, I\nexplained the continuous identity of each personal consciousness as a\nname for the practical fact that new experiences[71] come which look\nback on the old ones, find them 'warm,' and greet and appropriate them\nas 'mine.' These operations mean, when analyzed empirically, several\ntolerably definite things, viz.:\n1. That the new experience has past time for its 'content,' and in that\ntime a pen that 'was';\n2. That 'warmth' was also about the pen, in the sense of a group of\nfeelings ('interest' aroused, 'attention' turned, 'eyes' employed, etc.)\nthat were closely connected with it and that now recur and evermore\nrecur with unbroken vividness, though from the pen of now, which may be\nonly an image, all such vividness may have gone;\n3. That these feelings are the nucleus of 'me';\n4. That whatever once was associated with them was, at least for that\none moment, 'mine'--my implement if associated with hand-feelings, my\n'percept' only, if only eye-feelings and attention-feelings were\ninvolved.\nThe pen, realized in this retrospective way as my percept, thus figures\nas a fact of 'conscious' life. But it does so only so far as\n'appropriation' has occurred; and appropriation is _part of the content\nof a later experience_ wholly additional to the originally 'pure' pen.\n_That_ pen, virtually both objective and subjective, is at its own\nmoment actually and intrinsically neither. It has to be looked back upon\nand _used_, in order to be classed in either distinctive way. But its\nuse, so called, is in the hands of the other experience, while _it_\nstands, throughout the operation, passive and unchanged.\nIf this pass muster as an intelligible account of how an experience\noriginally pure can enter into one consciousness, the next question is\nas to how it might conceivably enter into two.\nIII\nObviously no new kind of condition would have to be supplied. All that\nwe should have to postulate would be a second subsequent experience,\ncollateral and contemporary with the first subsequent one, in which a\nsimilar act of appropriation should occur. The two acts would interfere\nneither with one another nor with the originally pure pen. It would\nsleep undisturbed in its own past, no matter how many such successors\nwent through their several appropriative acts. Each would know it as\n'my' percept, each would class it as a 'conscious' fact.\nNor need their so classing it interfere in the least with their classing\nit at the same time as a physical pen. Since the classing in both cases\ndepends upon the taking of it in one group or another of associates, if\nthe superseding experience were of wide enough 'span' it could think the\npen in both groups simultaneously, and yet distinguish the two groups.\nIt would then see the whole situation conformably to what we call 'the\nrepresentative theory of cognition,' and that is what we all\nspontaneously do. As a man philosophizing 'popularly,' I believe that\nwhat I see myself writing with is double--I think it in its relations to\nphysical nature, and also in its relations to my personal life; I see\nthat it is in my mind, but that it also is a physical pen.\nThe paradox of the same experience figuring in two consciousnesses seems\nthus no paradox at all. To be 'conscious' means not simply to be, but to\nbe reported, known, to have awareness of one's being added to that\nbeing; and this is just what happens when the appropriative experience\nsupervenes. The pen-experience in its original immediacy is not aware of\nitself, it simply _is_, and the second experience is required for what\nwe call awareness of it to occur.[72] The difficulty of understanding\nwhat happens here is, therefore, not a logical difficulty: there is no\ncontradiction involved. It is an ontological difficulty rather.\nExperiences come on an enormous scale, and if we take them all\ntogether, they come in a chaos of incommensurable relations that we can\nnot straighten out. We have to abstract different groups of them, and\nhandle these separately if we are to talk of them at all. But how the\nexperiences ever _get themselves made_, or _why_ their characters and\nrelations are just such as appear, we can not begin to understand.\nGranting, however, that, by hook or crook, they _can_ get themselves\nmade, and can appear in the successions that I have so schematically\ndescribed, then we have to confess that even although (as I began by\nquoting from the adversary) 'a feeling only is as it is felt,' there is\nstill nothing absurd in the notion of its being felt in two different\nways at once, as yours, namely, and as mine. It is, indeed, 'mine' only\nas it is felt as mine, and 'yours' only as it is felt as yours. But it\nis felt as neither _by itself_, but only when 'owned' by our two several\nremembering experiences, just as one undivided estate is owned by\nseveral heirs.\nIV\nOne word, now, before I close, about the corollaries of the views set\nforth. Since the acquisition of conscious quality on the part of an\nexperience depends upon a context coming to it, it follows that the sum\ntotal of all experiences, having no context, can not strictly be called\nconscious at all. It is a _that_, an Absolute, a 'pure' experience on an\nenormous scale, undifferentiated and undifferentiable into thought and\nthing. This the post-Kantian idealists have always practically\nacknowledged by calling their doctrine an _Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_. The\nquestion of the _Beseelung_ of the All of things ought not, then, even\nto be asked. No more ought the question of its _truth_ to be asked, for\ntruth is a relation inside of the sum total, obtaining between thoughts\nand something else, and thoughts, as we have seen, can only be\ncontextual things. In these respects the pure experiences of our\nphilosophy are, in themselves considered, so many little absolutes, the\nphilosophy of pure experience being only a more comminuted\n_Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_.[73]\nMeanwhile, a pure experience can be postulated with any amount whatever\nof span or field. If it exert the retrospective and appropriative\nfunction on any other piece of experience, the latter thereby enters\ninto its own conscious stream. And in this operation time intervals make\nno essential difference. After sleeping, my retrospection is as perfect\nas it is between two successive waking moments of my time. Accordingly\nif, millions of years later, a similarly retrospective experience should\nanyhow come to birth, my present thought would form a genuine portion of\nits long-span conscious life. 'Form a portion,' I say, but not in the\nsense that the two things could be entitatively or substantively\none--they cannot, for they are numerically discrete facts--but only in\nthe sense that the _functions_ of my present thought, its knowledge, its\npurpose, its content and 'consciousness,' in short, being inherited,\nwould be continued practically unchanged. Speculations like Fechner's,\nof an Earth-soul, of wider spans of consciousness enveloping narrower\nones throughout the cosmos, are, therefore, philosophically quite in\norder, provided they distinguish the functional from the entitative\npoint of view, and do not treat the minor consciousness under discussion\nas a kind of standing material of which the wider ones _consist_.[74]\nFOOTNOTES:\n[68] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Thoughts, we all naturally think, are made of one kind of\nsubstance, and things of another. Consciousness, flowing inside of us in\nthe forms of conception or judgment, or concentrating itself in the\nshape of passion or emotion, can be directly felt as the spiritual\nactivity which it is, and known in contrast with the space-filling\nobjective 'content' which it envelopes and accompanies. In opposition to\nthis dualistic philosophy, I tried, in [the first essay] to show that\nthoughts and things are absolutely homogeneous as to their material, and\nthat their opposition is only one of relation and of function. There is\nno thought-stuff different from thing-stuff, I said; but the same\nidentical piece of 'pure experience' (which was the name I gave to the\n_materia prima_ of everything) can stand alternately for a 'fact of\nconsciousness' or for a physical reality, according as it is taken in\none context or in another. For the right understanding of what follows,\nI shall have to presuppose that the reader will have read that\n[essay].[76]\nThe commonest objection which the doctrine there laid down runs up\nagainst is drawn from the existence of our 'affections.' In our\npleasures and pains, our loves and fears and angers, in the beauty,\ncomicality, importance or preciousness of certain objects and\nsituations, we have, I am told by many critics, a great realm of\nexperience intuitively recognized as spiritual, made, and felt to be\nmade, of consciousness exclusively, and different in nature from the\nspace-filling kind of being which is enjoyed by physical objects. In\nSection VII. of [the first essay], I treated of this class of\nexperiences very inadequately, because I had to be so brief. I now\nreturn to the subject, because I believe that, so far from invalidating\nmy general thesis, these phenomena, when properly analyzed, afford it\npowerful support.\nThe central point of the pure-experience theory is that 'outer' and\n'inner' are names for two groups into which we sort experiences\naccording to the way in which they act upon their neighbors. Any one\n'content,' such as _hard_, let us say, can be assigned to either group.\nIn the outer group it is 'strong,' it acts 'energetically' and\naggressively. Here whatever is hard interferes with the space its\nneighbors occupy. It dents them; is impenetrable by them; and we call\nthe hardness then a physical hardness. In the mind, on the contrary, the\nhard thing is nowhere in particular, it dents nothing, it suffuses\nthrough its mental neighbors, as it were, and interpenetrates them.\nTaken in this group we call both it and them 'ideas' or 'sensations';\nand the basis of the two groups respectively is the different type of\ninterrelation, the mutual impenetrability, on the one hand, and the\nlack of physical interference and interaction, on the other.\nThat what in itself is one and the same entity should be able to\nfunction thus differently in different contexts is a natural consequence\nof the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come. To\nher offspring a tigress is tender, but cruel to every other living\nthing--both cruel and tender, therefore, at once. A mass in movement\nresists every force that operates contrariwise to its own direction, but\nto forces that pursue the same direction, or come in at right angles, it\nis absolutely inert. It is thus both energetic and inert; and the same\nis true (if you vary the associates properly) of every other piece of\nexperience. It is only towards certain specific groups of associates\nthat the physical energies, as we call them, of a content are put forth.\nIn another group it may be quite inert.\nIt is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only\nalternative between neighbors would be either physical interaction or\ncomplete inertness. In such a world the mental or the physical _status_\nof any piece of experience would be unequivocal. When active, it would\nfigure in the physical, and when inactive, in the mental group.\nBut the universe we live in is more chaotic than this, and there is room\nin it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our affectional experiences,\nof our emotions and appreciative perceptions. In the paragraphs that\nfollow I shall try to show:\n(1) That the popular notion that these experiences are intuitively given\nas purely inner facts is hasty and erroneous; and\n(2) That their ambiguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that\nsubjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of what an experience is\naboriginally made of, but of its classification. Classifications depend\non our temporary purposes. For certain purposes it is convenient to take\nthings in one set of relations, for other purposes in another set. In\nthe two cases their contexts are apt to be different. In the case of our\naffectional experiences we have no permanent and steadfast purpose that\nobliges us to be consistent, so we find it easy to let them float\nambiguously, sometimes classing them with our feelings, sometimes with\nmore physical realities, according to caprice or to the convenience of\nthe moment. Thus would these experiences, so far from being an obstacle\nto the pure experience philosophy, serve as an excellent corroboration\nof its truth.\nFirst of all, then, it is a mistake to say, with the objectors whom I\nbegan by citing, that anger, love and fear are affections purely of the\nmind. That, to a great extent at any rate, they are simultaneously\naffections of the body is proved by the whole literature of the\nJames-Lange theory of emotion.[77] All our pains, moreover, are local,\nand we are always free to speak of them in objective as well as in\nsubjective terms. We can say that we are aware of a painful place,\nfilling a certain bigness in our organism, or we can say that we are\ninwardly in a 'state' of pain. All our adjectives of worth are\nsimilarly ambiguous--I instanced some of the ambiguities [in the first\nessay].[78] Is the preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem? or is\nit a feeling in our mind? Practically we treat it as both or as either,\naccording to the temporary direction of our thought. 'Beauty,' says\nProfessor Santayana, 'is pleasure objectified'; and in Sections 10 and\n11 of his work, _The Sense of Beauty_, he treats in a masterly way of\nthis equivocal realm. The various pleasures we receive from an object\nmay count as 'feelings' when we take them singly, but when they combine\nin a total richness, we call the result the 'beauty' of the object, and\ntreat it as an outer attribute which our mind perceives. We discover\nbeauty just as we discover the physical properties of things. Training\nis needed to make us expert in either line. Single sensations also may\nbe ambiguous. Shall we say an 'agreeable degree of heat,' or an\n'agreeable feeling' occasioned by the degree of heat? Either will do;\nand language would lose most of its esthetic and rhetorical value were\nwe forbidden to project words primarily connoting our affections upon\nthe objects by which the affections are aroused. The man is really\nhateful; the action really mean; the situation really tragic--all in\nthemselves and quite apart from our opinion. We even go so far as to\ntalk of a weary road, a giddy height, a jocund morning or a sullen sky;\nand the term 'indefinite' while usually applied only to our\napprehensions, functions as a fundamental physical qualification of\nthings in Spencer's 'law of evolution,' and doubtless passes with most\nreaders for all right.\nPsychologists, studying our perceptions of movement, have unearthed\nexperiences in which movement is felt in general but not ascribed\ncorrectly to the body that really moves. Thus in optical vertigo, caused\nby unconscious movements of our eyes, both we and the external universe\nappear to be in a whirl. When clouds float by the moon, it is as if both\nclouds and moon and we ourselves shared in the motion. In the\nextraordinary case of amnesia of the Rev. Mr. Hanna, published by Sidis\nand Goodhart in their important work on _Multiple Personality_, we read\nthat when the patient first recovered consciousness and \"noticed an\nattendant walk across the room, he identified the movement with that of\nhis own. He did not yet discriminate between his own movements and those\noutside himself.\"[79] Such experiences point to a primitive stage of\nperception in which discriminations afterwards needful have not yet been\nmade. A piece of experience of a determinate sort is there, but there at\nfirst as a 'pure' fact. Motion originally simply _is_; only later is it\nconfined to this thing or to that. Something like this is true of every\nexperience, however complex, at the moment of its actual presence. Let\nthe reader arrest himself in the act of reading this article now. _Now_\nthis is a pure experience, a phenomenon, or datum, a mere _that_ or\ncontent of fact. _'Reading' simply is, is there_; and whether there for\nsome one's consciousness, or there for physical nature, is a question\nnot yet put. At the moment, it is there for neither; later we shall\nprobably judge it to have been there for both.\nWith the affectional experiences which we are considering, the\nrelatively 'pure' condition lasts. In practical life no urgent need has\nyet arisen for deciding whether to treat them as rigorously mental or as\nrigorously physical facts. So they remain equivocal; and, as the world\ngoes, their equivocality is one of their great conveniences.\nThe shifting place of 'secondary qualities' in the history of\nphilosophy[80] is another excellent proof of the fact that 'inner' and\n'outer' are not coefficients with which experiences come to us\naboriginally stamped, but are rather results of a later classification\nperformed by us for particular needs. The common-sense stage of thought\nis a perfectly definite practical halting-place, the place where we\nourselves can proceed to act unhesitatingly. On this stage of thought\nthings act on each other as well as on us by means of their secondary\nqualities. Sound, as such, goes through the air and can be intercepted.\nThe heat of the fire passes over, as such, into the water which it sets\na-boiling. It is the very light of the arc-lamp which displaces the\ndarkness of the midnight street, etc. By engendering and translocating\njust these qualities, actively efficacious as they seem to be, we\nourselves succeed in altering nature so as to suit us; and until more\npurely intellectual, as distinguished from practical, needs had arisen,\nno one ever thought of calling these qualities subjective. When,\nhowever, Galileo, Descartes, and others found it best for philosophic\npurposes to class sound, heat, and light along with pain and pleasure as\npurely mental phenomena, they could do so with impunity.[81]\nEven the primary qualities are undergoing the same fate. Hardness and\nsoftness are effects on us of atomic interactions, and the atoms\nthemselves are neither hard nor soft, nor solid nor liquid. Size and\nshape are deemed subjective by Kantians; time itself is subjective\naccording to many philosophers;[82] and even the activity and causal\nefficacy which lingered in physics long after secondary qualities were\nbanished are now treated as illusory projections outwards of phenomena\nof our own consciousness. There are no activities or effects in nature,\nfor the most intellectual contemporary school of physical speculation.\nNature exhibits only _changes_, which habitually coincide with one\nanother so that their habits are describable in simple 'laws.'[83]\nThere is no original spirituality or materiality of being, intuitively\ndiscerned, then; but only a translocation of experiences from one world\nto another; a grouping of them with one set or another of associates for\ndefinitely practical or intellectual ends.\nI will say nothing here of the persistent ambiguity of _relations_. They\nare undeniable parts of pure experience; yet, while common sense and\nwhat I call radical empiricism stand for their being objective, both\nrationalism and the usual empiricism claim that they are exclusively the\n'work of the mind'--the finite mind or the absolute mind, as the case\nmay be.\n*       *       *       *       *\nTurn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us.\nWe soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our\ninterests and emotions from the ways in which they act upon one another.\nIt does not _work_ to assume that physical objects are going to act\noutwardly by their sympathetic or antipathetic qualities. The beauty of\na thing or its value is no force that can be plotted in a polygon of\ncompositions, nor does its 'use' or 'significance' affect in the\nminutest degree its vicissitudes or destiny at the hands of physical\nnature. Chemical 'affinities' are a purely verbal metaphor; and, as I\njust said, even such things as forces, tensions, and activities can at a\npinch be regarded as anthropomorphic projections. So far, then, as the\nphysical world means the collection of contents that determine in each\nother certain regular changes, the whole collection of our appreciative\nattributes has to be treated as falling outside of it. If we mean by\nphysical nature whatever lies beyond the surface of our bodies, these\nattributes are inert throughout the whole extent of physical nature.\nWhy then do men leave them as ambiguous as they do, and not class them\ndecisively as purely spiritual?\nThe reason would seem to be that, although they are inert as regards the\nrest of physical nature, they are not inert as regards that part of\nphysical nature which our own skin covers. It is those very appreciative\nattributes of things, their dangerousness, beauty, rarity, utility,\netc., that primarily appeal to our attention. In our commerce with\nnature these attributes are what give _emphasis_ to objects; and for an\nobject to be emphatic, whatever spiritual fact it may mean, means also\nthat it produces immediate bodily effects upon us, alterations of tone\nand tension, of heart-beat and breathing, of vascular and visceral\naction. The 'interesting' aspects of things are thus not wholly inert\nphysically, though they be active only in these small corners of\nphysical nature which our bodies occupy. That, however, is enough to\nsave them from being classed as absolutely non-objective.\nThe attempt, if any one should make it, to sort experiences into two\nabsolutely discrete groups, with nothing but inertness in one of them\nand nothing but activities in the other, would thus receive one check.\nIt would receive another as soon as we examined the more distinctively\nmental group; for though in that group it be true that things do not act\non one another by their physical properties, do not dent each other or\nset fire to each other, they yet act on each other in the most energetic\nway by those very characters which are so inert extracorporeally. It is\nby the interest and importance that experiences have for us, by the\nemotions they excite, and the purposes they subserve, by their affective\nvalues, in short, that their consecution in our several conscious\nstreams, as 'thoughts' of ours, is mainly ruled. Desire introduces them;\ninterest holds them; fitness fixes their order and connection. I need\nonly refer for this aspect of our mental life, to Wundt's article 'Ueber\npsychische Causalit\u00e4t,' which begins Volume X. of his _Philosophische\nStudien_.[84]\nIt thus appears that the ambiguous or amphibious _status_ which we find\nour epithets of value occupying is the most natural thing in the world.\nIt would, however, be an unnatural status if the popular opinion which I\ncited at the outset were correct. If 'physical' and 'mental' meant two\ndifferent kinds of intrinsic nature, immediately, intuitively, and\ninfallibly discernible, and each fixed forever in whatever bit of\nexperience it qualified, one does not see how there could ever have\narisen any room for doubt or ambiguity. But if, on the contrary, these\nwords are words of sorting, ambiguity is natural. For then, as soon as\nthe relations of a thing are sufficiently various it can be sorted\nvariously. Take a mass of carrion, for example, and the\n'disgustingness' which for us is part of the experience. The sun\ncaresses it, and the zephyr wooes it as if it were a bed of roses. So\nthe disgustingness fails to _operate_ within the realm of suns and\nbreezes,--it does not function as a physical quality. But the carrion\n'turns our stomach' by what seems a direct operation--it _does_ function\nphysically, therefore, in that limited part of physics. We can treat it\nas physical or as non-physical according as we take it in the narrower\nor in the wider context, and conversely, of course, we must treat it as\nnon-mental or as mental.\nOur body itself is the palmary instance of the ambiguous. Sometimes I\ntreat my body purely as a part of outer nature. Sometimes, again, I\nthink of it as 'mine,' I sort it with the 'me,' and then certain local\nchanges and determinations in it pass for spiritual happenings. Its\nbreathing is my 'thinking,' its sensorial adjustments are my\n'attention,' its kinesthetic alterations are my 'efforts,' its visceral\nperturbations are my 'emotions.' The obstinate controversies that have\narisen over such statements as these (which sound so paradoxical, and\nwhich can yet be made so seriously) prove how hard it is to decide by\nbare introspection what it is in experiences that shall make them either\nspiritual or material. It surely can be nothing intrinsic in the\nindividual experience. It is their way of behaving towards each other,\ntheir system of relations, their function; and all these things vary\nwith the context in which we find it opportune to consider them.\nI think I may conclude, then (and I hope that my readers are now ready\nto conclude with me), that the pretended spirituality of our emotions\nand of our attributes of value, so far from proving an objection to the\nphilosophy of pure experience, does, when rightly discussed and\naccounted for, serve as one of its best corroborations.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[75] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Professor Woodbridge's _Journal\nof Philosophy_[86] seems unintentionally to have become a sort of\nmeeting place for those who follow these tendencies in America. There is\nonly a dim identity among them; and the most that can be said at present\nis that some sort of gestation seems to be in the atmosphere, and that\nalmost any day a man with a genius for finding the right word for things\nmay hit upon some unifying and conciliating formula that will make so\nmuch vaguely similar aspiration crystallize into more definite form.\nI myself have given the name of 'radical empiricism' to that version of\nthe tendency in question which I prefer; and I propose, if you will now\nlet me, to illustrate what I mean by radical empiricism, by applying it\nto activity as an example, hoping at the same time incidentally to\nleave the general problem of activity in a slightly--I fear very\nslightly--more manageable shape than before.\nMr. Bradley calls the question of activity a scandal to philosophy, and\nif one turns to the current literature of the subject--his own writings\nincluded--one easily gathers what he means. The opponents cannot even\nunderstand one another. Mr. Bradley says to Mr. Ward: \"I do not care\nwhat your oracle is, and your preposterous psychology may here be gospel\nif you please; ... but if the revelation does contain a meaning, I will\ncommit myself to this: either the oracle is so confused that its\nsignification is not discoverable, or, upon the other hand, if it can be\npinned down to any definite statement, then that statement will be\nfalse.\"[87] Mr. Ward in turn says of Mr. Bradley: \"I cannot even imagine\nthe state of mind to which his description applies.... [It] reads like\nan unintentional travesty of Herbartian psychology by one who has tried\nto improve upon it without being at the pains to master it.\"[88]\nM\u00fcnsterberg excludes a view opposed to his own by saying that with any\none who holds it a _Verst\u00e4ndigung_ with him is \"_grunds\u00e4tzlich\nausgeschlossen_\"; and Royce, in a review of Stout,[89] hauls him over\nthe coals at great length for defending 'efficacy' in a way which I, for\none, never gathered from reading him, and which I have heard Stout\nhimself say was quite foreign to the intention of his text.\nIn these discussions distinct questions are habitually jumbled and\ndifferent points of view are talked of _durcheinander_.\n(1) There is a psychological question: \"Have we perceptions of activity?\nand if so, what are they like, and when and where do we have them?\"\n(2) There is a metaphysical question: \"Is there a _fact_ of activity?\nand if so, what idea must we frame of it? What is it like? and what\ndoes it do, if it does anything?\" And finally there is a logical\nquestion:\n(3) \"Whence do we _know_ activity? By our own feelings of it solely? or\nby some other source of information?\" Throughout page after page of the\nliterature one knows not which of these questions is before one; and\nmere description of the surface-show of experience is proferred as if it\nimplicitly answered every one of them. No one of the disputants,\nmoreover, tries to show what pragmatic consequences his own view would\ncarry, or what assignable particular differences in any one's experience\nit would make if his adversary's were triumphant.\nIt seems to me that if radical empiricism be good for anything, it\nought, with its pragmatic method and its principle of pure experience,\nto be able to avoid such tangles, or at least to simplify them somewhat.\nThe pragmatic method starts from the postulate that there is no\ndifference of truth that doesn't make a difference of fact somewhere;\nand it seeks to determine the meaning of all differences of opinion by\nmaking the discussion hinge as soon as possible upon some practical or\nparticular issue. The principle of pure experience is also a methodical\npostulate. Nothing shall be admitted as fact, it says, except what can\nbe experienced at some definite time by some experient; and for every\nfeature of fact ever so experienced, a definite place must be found\nsomewhere in the final system of reality. In other words: Everything\nreal must be experienceable somewhere, and every kind of thing\nexperienced must somewhere be real.\nArmed with these rules of method let us see what face the problems of\nactivity present to us.\nBy the principle of pure experience, either the word 'activity' must\nhave no meaning at all, or else the original type and model of what it\nmeans must lie in some concrete kind of experience that can be\ndefinitely pointed out. Whatever ulterior judgments we may eventually\ncome to make regarding activity, _that sort_ of thing will be what the\njudgments are about. The first step to take, then, is to ask where in\nthe stream of experience we seem to find what we speak of as activity.\nWhat we are to think of the activity thus found will be a later\nquestion.\nNow it is obvious that we are tempted to affirm activity wherever we\nfind anything _going on_. Taken in the broadest sense, any apprehension\nof something _doing_, is an experience of activity. Were our world\ndescribable only by the words 'nothing happening,' 'nothing changing,'\n'nothing doing,' we should unquestionably call it an 'inactive' world.\nBare activity then, as we may call it, means the bare fact of event or\nchange. 'Change taking place' is a unique content of experience, one of\nthose 'conjunctive' objects which radical empiricism seeks so earnestly\nto rehabilitate and preserve. The sense of activity is thus in the\nbroadest and vaguest way synonymous with the sense of 'life.' We should\nfeel our own subjective life at least, even in noticing and proclaiming\nan otherwise inactive world. Our own reaction on its monotony would be\nthe one thing experienced there in the form of something coming to\npass.\nThis seems to be what certain writers have in mind when they insist that\nfor an experient to be at all is to be active. It seems to justify, or\nat any rate to explain, Mr. Ward's expression that we _are_ only as we\nare active,[90] for we _are_ only as experients; and it rules out Mr.\nBradley's contention that \"there is no original experience of anything\nlike activity.\"[91] What we ought to say about activities thus\nelementary, whose they are, what they effect, or whether indeed they\neffect anything at all--these are later questions, to be answered only\nwhen the field of experience is enlarged.\nBare activity would thus be predicable, though there were no definite\ndirection, no actor, and no aim. Mere restless zigzag movement, or a\nwild _Ideenflucht_, or _Rhapsodie der Wahrnehmungen_, as Kant would\nsay,[92] would constitute an active as distinguished from an inactive\nworld.\nBut in this actual world of ours, as it is given, a part at least of\nthe activity comes with definite direction; it comes with desire and\nsense of goal; it comes complicated with resistances which it\novercomes or succumbs to, and with the efforts which the feeling of\nresistance so often provokes; and it is in complex experiences like\nthese that the notions of distinct agents, and of passivity as opposed\nto activity arise. Here also the notion of causal efficacy comes to\nbirth. Perhaps the most elaborate work ever done in descriptive\npsychology has been the analysis by various recent writers of the more\ncomplex activity-situations.[93] In their descriptions, exquisitely\nsubtle some of them,[94] the activity appears as the _gestaltqualit\u00e4t_\nor the _fundirte inhalt_ (or as whatever else you may please to call\nthe conjunctive form) which the content falls into when we experience\nit in the ways which the describers set forth. Those factors in those\nrelations are what we mean by activity-situations; and to the possible\nenumeration and accumulation of their circumstances and ingredients\nthere would seem to be no natural bound. Every hour of human life\ncould contribute to the picture gallery; and this is the only fault\nthat one can find with such descriptive industry--where is it going to\nstop? Ought we to listen forever to verbal pictures of what we have\nalready in concrete form in our own breasts?[95] They never take us\noff the superficial plane. We knew the facts already--less spread out\nand separated, to be sure--but we knew them still. We always felt our\nown activity, for example, as 'the expansion of an idea with which our\nSelf is identified, against an obstacle';[96] and the following out of\nsuch a definition through a multitude of cases elaborates the obvious\nso as to be little more than an exercise in synonymic speech.\nAll the descriptions have to trace familiar outlines, and to use\nfamiliar terms. The activity is, for example, attributed either to a\nphysical or to a mental agent, and is either aimless or directed. If\ndirected it shows tendency. The tendency may or may not be resisted. If\nnot, we call the activity immanent, as when a body moves in empty space\nby its momentum, or our thoughts wander at their own sweet will. If\nresistance is met, _its_ agent complicates the situation. If now, in\nspite of resistance, the original tendency continues, effort makes its\nappearance, and along with effort, strain or squeeze. Will, in the\nnarrower sense of the word, then comes upon the scene, whenever, along\nwith the tendency, the strain and squeeze are sustained. But the\nresistance may be great enough to check the tendency, or even to reverse\nits path. In that case, we (if 'we' were the original agents or subjects\nof the tendency) are overpowered. The phenomenon turns into one of\ntension simply, or of necessity succumbed-to, according as the opposing\npower is only equal, or is superior to ourselves.\nWhosoever describes an experience in such terms as these describes an\nexperience _of_ activity. If the word have any meaning, it must denote\nwhat there is found. _There_ is complete activity in its original and\nfirst intention. What it is 'known-as' is what there appears. The\nexperiencer of such a situation possesses all that the idea contains. He\nfeels the tendency, the obstacle, the will, the strain, the triumph, or\nthe passive giving up, just as he feels the time, the space, the\nswiftness or intensity, the movement, the weight and color, the pain and\npleasure, the complexity, or whatever remaining characters the situation\nmay involve. He goes through all that ever can be imagined where\nactivity is supposed. If we suppose activities to go on outside of our\nexperience, it is in forms like these that we must suppose them, or else\ngive them some other name; for the word 'activity' has no imaginable\ncontent whatever save these experiences of process, obstruction,\nstriving, strain, or release, ultimate _qualia_ as they are of the life\ngiven us to be known.\nWere this the end of the matter, one might think that whenever we had\nsuccessfully lived through an activity-situation we should have to be\npermitted, without provoking contradiction, to say that we had been\nreally active, that we had met real resistance and had really prevailed.\nLotze somewhere says that to be an entity all that is necessary is to\n_gelten_ as an entity, to operate, or be felt, experienced, recognized,\nor in any way realized, as such.[97] In our activity-experiences the\nactivity assuredly fulfils Lotze's demand. It makes itself _gelten_. It\nis witnessed at its work. No matter what activities there may really be\nin this extraordinary universe of ours, it is impossible for us to\nconceive of any one of them being either lived through or authentically\nknown otherwise than in this dramatic shape of something sustaining a\nfelt purpose against felt obstacles and overcoming or being overcome.\nWhat 'sustaining' means here is clear to anyone who has lived through\nthe experience, but to no one else; just as 'loud,' 'red,' 'sweet,' mean\nsomething only to beings with ears, eyes, and tongues. The _percipi_ in\nthese originals of experience is the _esse_; the curtain is the picture.\nIf there is anything hiding in the background, it ought not to be called\nactivity, but should get itself another name.\nThis seems so obviously true that one might well experience astonishment\nat finding so many of the ablest writers on the subject flatly denying\nthat the activity we live through in these situations is real. Merely to\nfeel active is not to be active, in their sight. The agents that appear\nin the experience are not real agents, the resistances do not really\nresist, the effects that appear are not really effects at all.[98] It\nis evident from this that mere descriptive analysis of any one of our\nactivity-experiences is not the whole story, that there is something\nstill to tell _about_ them that has led such able writers to conceive of\na _Simon-pure_ activity, of an activity _an sich_, that does, and\ndoesn't merely appear to us to do, and compared with whose real doing\nall this phenomenal activity is but a specious sham.\nThe metaphysical question opens here; and I think that the state of mind\nof one possessed by it is often something like this: \"It is all very\nwell,\" we may imagine him saying, \"to talk about certain\nexperience-series taking on the form of feelings of activity, just as\nthey might take on musical or geometric forms. Suppose that they do so;\nsuppose we feel a will to stand a strain. Does our feeling do more than\n_record_ the fact that the strain is sustained? The _real_ activity,\nmeanwhile, is the _doing_ of the fact; and what is the doing made of\nbefore the record is made. What in the will _enables_ it to act thus?\nAnd these trains of experience themselves, in which activities appear,\nwhat makes them _go_ at all? Does the activity in one bit of experience\nbring the next bit into being? As an empiricist you cannot say so, for\nyou have just declared activity to be only a kind of synthetic object,\nor conjunctive relation experienced between bits of experience already\nmade. But what made them at all? What propels experience _\u00fcberhaupt_\ninto being? _There_ is the activity that _operates_; the activity _felt_\nis only its superficial sign.\"\nTo the metaphysical question, popped upon us in this way, I must pay\nserious attention ere I end my remarks; but, before doing so, let me\nshow that without leaving the immediate reticulations of experience, or\nasking what makes activity itself act, we still find the distinction\nbetween less real and more real activities forced upon us, and are\ndriven to much soul-searching on the purely phenomenal plane.\nWe must not forget, namely, in talking of the ultimate character of our\nactivity-experiences, that each of them is but a portion of a wider\nworld, one link in the vast chain of processes of experience out of\nwhich history is made. Each partial process, to him who lives through\nit, defines itself by its origin and its goal; but to an observer with\na wider mind-span who should live outside of it, that goal would appear\nbut as a provisional halting-place, and the subjectively felt activity\nwould be seen to continue into objective activities that led far beyond.\nWe thus acquire a habit, in discussing activity-experiences, of defining\nthem by their relation to something more. If an experience be one of\nnarrow span, it will be mistaken as to what activity it is and whose.\nYou think that _you_ are acting while you are only obeying someone's\npush. You think you are doing _this_, but you are doing something of\nwhich you do not dream. For instance, you think you are but drinking\nthis glass; but you are really creating the liver-cirrhosis that will\nend your days. You think you are just driving this bargain, but, as\nStevenson says somewhere, you are laying down a link in the policy of\nmankind.\nGenerally speaking, the onlooker, with his wider field of vision,\nregards the _ultimate outcome_ of an activity as what it is more really\ndoing; and _the most previous agent_ ascertainable, being the first\nsource of action, he regards as the most real agent in the field. The\nothers but transmit that agent's impulse; on him we put responsibility;\nwe name him when one asks us 'Who's to blame?'\nBut the most previous agents ascertainable, instead of being of longer\nspan, are often of much shorter span than the activity in view.\nBrain-cells are our best example. My brain-cells are believed to excite\neach other from next to next (by contiguous transmission of katabolic\nalteration, let us say) and to have been doing so long before this\npresent stretch of lecturing-activity on my part began. If any one\ncell-group stops its activity, the lecturing will cease or show disorder\nof form. _Cessante causa, cessat et effectus_--does not this look as if\nthe short-span brain activities were the more real activities, and the\nlecturing activities on my part only their effects? Moreover, as Hume so\nclearly pointed out,[99] in my mental activity-situation the words\nphysically to be uttered are represented as the activity's immediate\ngoal. These words, however, cannot be uttered without intermediate\nphysical processes in the bulb and vagi nerves, which processes\nnevertheless fail to figure in the mental activity-series at all. That\nseries, therefore, since it leaves out vitally real steps of action,\ncannot represent the real activities. It is something purely subjective;\nthe _facts_ of activity are elsewhere. They are something far more\ninterstitial, so to speak, than what my feelings record.\nThe _real_ facts of activity that have in point of fact been\nsystematically pleaded for by philosophers have, so far as my\ninformation goes, been of three principal types.\nThe first type takes a consciousness of wider time-span than ours to be\nthe vehicle of the more real activity. Its will is the agent, and its\npurpose is the action done.\nThe second type assumes that 'ideas' struggling with one another are the\nagents, and that the prevalence of one set of them is the action.\nThe third type believes that nerve-cells are the agents, and that\nresultant motor discharges are the acts achieved.\nNow if we must de-realize our immediately felt activity-situations for\nthe benefit of either of these types of substitute, we ought to know\nwhat the substitution practically involves. _What practical difference\nought it to make if_, instead of saying na\u00efvely that 'I' am active now\nin delivering this address, I say that _a wider thinker is active_, or\nthat _certain ideas are active_, or that _certain nerve-cells are\nactive_, in producing the result?\nThis would be the pragmatic meaning of the three hypotheses. Let us take\nthem in succession in seeking a reply.\nIf we assume a wider thinker, it is evident that his purposes envelope\nmine. I am really lecturing _for_ him; and although I cannot surely know\nto what end, yet if I take him religiously, I can trust it to be a good\nend, and willingly connive. I can be happy in thinking that my activity\ntransmits his impulse, and that his ends prolong my own. So long as I\ntake him religiously, in short, he does not de-realize my activities.\nHe tends rather to corroborate the reality of them, so long as I believe\nboth them and him to be good.\nWhen now we turn to ideas, the case is different, inasmuch as ideas are\nsupposed by the association psychology to influence each other only from\nnext to next. The 'span' of an idea or pair of ideas, is assumed to be\nmuch smaller instead of being larger than that of my total conscious\nfield. The same results may get worked out in both cases, for this\naddress is being given anyhow. But the ideas supposed to 'really' work\nit out had no prevision of the whole of it; and if I was lecturing for\nan absolute thinker in the former case, so, by similar reasoning, are my\nideas now lecturing for me, that is, accomplishing unwittingly a result\nwhich I approve and adopt. But, when this passing lecture is over, there\nis nothing in the bare notion that ideas have been its agents that would\nseem to guarantee that my present purposes in lecturing will be\nprolonged. _I_ may have ulterior developments in view; but there is no\ncertainty that my ideas as such will wish to, or be able to, work them\nout.\nThe like is true if nerve-cells be the agents. The activity of a\nnerve-cell must be conceived of as a tendency of exceedingly short\nreach, an 'impulse' barely spanning the way to the next cell--for surely\nthat amount of actual 'process' must be 'experienced' by the cells if\nwhat happens between them is to deserve the name of activity at all. But\nhere again the gross resultant, as _I_ perceive it, is indifferent to\nthe agents, and neither wished or willed or foreseen. Their being agents\nnow congruous with my will gives me no guarantee that like results will\nrecur again from their activity. In point of fact, all sorts of other\nresults do occur. My mistakes, impotencies, perversions, mental\nobstructions, and frustrations generally, are also results of the\nactivity of cells. Although these are letting me lecture now, on other\noccasions they make me do things that I would willingly not do.\nThe question _Whose is the real activity?_ is thus tantamount to the\nquestion _What will be the actual results?_ Its interest is dramatic;\nhow will things work out? If the agents are of one sort, one way; if of\nanother sort, they may work out very differently. The pragmatic meaning\nof the various alternatives, in short, is great. It makes no merely\nverbal difference which opinion we take up.\nYou see it is the old dispute come back! Materialism and teleology;\nelementary short-span actions summing themselves 'blindly,' or far\nforeseen ideals coming with effort into act.\nNa\u00efvely we believe, and humanly and dramatically we like to believe,\nthat activities both of wider and of narrower span are at work in life\ntogether, that both are real, and that the long-span tendencies yoke the\nothers in their service, encouraging them in the right direction, and\ndamping them when they tend in other ways. But how to represent clearly\nthe _modus operandi_ of such steering of small tendencies by large ones\nis a problem which metaphysical thinkers will have to ruminate upon for\nmany years to come. Even if such control should eventually grow clearly\npicturable, the question how far it is successfully exerted in this\nactual world can be answered only by investigating the details of fact.\nNo philosophic knowledge of the general nature and constitution of\ntendencies, or of the relation of larger to smaller ones, can help us to\npredict which of all the various competing tendencies that interest us\nin this universe are likeliest to prevail. We know as an empirical fact\nthat far-seeing tendencies often carry out their purpose, but we know\nalso that they are often defeated by the failure of some contemptibly\nsmall process on which success depends. A little thrombus in a\nstatesman's meningeal artery will throw an empire out of gear. I can\ntherefore not even hint at any solution of the pragmatic issue. I have\nonly wished to show you that that issue is what gives the real interest\nto all inquiries into what kinds of activity may be real. Are the forces\nthat really act in the world more foreseeing or more blind? As between\n'our' activities as 'we' experience them, and those of our ideas, or of\nour brain-cells, the issue is well-defined.\nI said a while back[100] that I should return to the 'metaphysical'\nquestion before ending; so, with a few words about that, I will now\nclose my remarks.\nIn whatever form we hear this question propounded, I think that it\nalways arises from two things, a belief that _causality_ must be exerted\nin activity, and a wonder as to how causality is made. If we take an\nactivity-situation at its face-value, it seems as if we caught _in\nflagrante delicto_ the very power that makes facts come and be. I now am\neagerly striving, for example, to get this truth which I seem half to\nperceive, into words which shall make it show more clearly. If the words\ncome, it will seem as if the striving itself had drawn or pulled them\ninto actuality out from the state of merely possible being in which they\nwere. How is this feat performed? How does the pulling _pull_? How do I\nget my hold on words not yet existent, and when they come by what means\nhave I _made_ them come? Really it is the problem of creation; for in\nthe end the question is: How do I make them _be_? Real activities are\nthose that really make things be, without which the things are not, and\nwith which they are there. Activity, so far as we merely feel it, on the\nother hand, is only an impression of ours, it may be maintained; and an\nimpression is, for all this way of thinking, only a shadow of another\nfact.\nArrived at this point, I can do little more than indicate the principles\non which, as it seems to me, a radically empirical philosophy is obliged\nto rely in handling such a dispute.\nIf there _be_ real creative activities in being, radical empiricism\nmust say, somewhere they must be immediately lived. Somewhere the\n_that_ of efficacious causing and the _what_ of it must be experienced\nin one, just as the what and the that of 'cold' are experienced in one\nwhenever a man has the sensation of cold here and now. It boots not to\nsay that our sensations are fallible. They are indeed; but to see the\nthermometer contradict us when we say 'it is cold' does not abolish\ncold as a specific nature from the universe. Cold is in the arctic\ncircle if not here. Even so, to feel that our train is moving when the\ntrain beside our window moves, to see the moon through a telescope\ncome twice as near, or to see two pictures as one solid when we look\nthrough a stereoscope at them, leaves motion, nearness, and solidity\nstill in being--if not here, yet each in its proper seat elsewhere.\nAnd wherever the seat of real causality _is_, as ultimately known 'for\ntrue' (in nerve-processes, if you will, that cause our feelings of\nactivity as well as the movements which these seem to prompt), a\nphilosophy of pure experience can consider the real causation as no\nother _nature_ of thing than that which even in our most erroneous\nexperiences appears to be at work. Exactly what appears there is what\nwe _mean_ by working, though we may later come to learn that working\nwas not exactly _there_. Sustaining, persevering, striving, paying\nwith effort as we go, hanging on, and finally achieving our\nintention--this _is_ action, this _is_ effectuation in the only shape\nin which, by a pure experience-philosophy, the whereabouts of it\nanywhere can be discussed. Here is creation in its first intention,\nhere is causality at work.[101] To treat this offhand as the bare\nillusory surface of a world whose real causality is an unimaginable\nontological principle hidden in the cubic deeps, is, for the more\nempirical way of thinking, only animism in another shape. You explain\nyour given fact by your 'principle,' but the principle itself, when\nyou look clearly at it, turns out to be nothing but a previous little\nspiritual copy of the fact. Away from that one and only kind of fact\nyour mind, considering causality, can never get.[102]\nI conclude, then, that real effectual causation as an ultimate nature,\nas a 'category,' if you like, of reality, is _just what we feel it to\nbe_, just that kind of conjunction which our own activity-series reveal.\nWe have the whole butt and being of it in our hands; and the healthy\nthing for philosophy is to leave off grubbing underground for what\neffects effectuation, or what makes action act, and to try to solve the\nconcrete questions of where effectuation in this world is located, of\nwhich things are the true causal agents there, and of what the more\nremote effects consist.\nFrom this point of view the greater sublimity traditionally attributed\nto the metaphysical inquiry, the grubbing inquiry, entirely disappears.\nIf we could know what causation really and transcendentally is in\nitself, the only _use_ of the knowledge would be to help us to recognize\nan actual cause when we had one, and so to track the future course of\noperations more intelligently out. The mere abstract inquiry into\ncausation's hidden nature is not more sublime than any other inquiry\nequally abstract. Causation inhabits no more sublime level than anything\nelse. It lives, apparently, in the dirt of the world as well as in the\nabsolute, or in man's unconquerable mind. The worth and interest of the\nworld consists not in its elements, be these elements things, or be\nthey the conjunctions of things; it exists rather in the dramatic\noutcome in the whole process, and in the meaning of the succession\nstages which the elements work out.\nMy colleague and master, Josiah Royce, in a page of his review of\nStout's _Analytic Psychology_[103] has some fine words on this point\nwith which I cordially agree. I cannot agree with his separating the\nnotion of efficacy from that of activity altogether (this I understand\nto be one contention of his) for activities are efficacious whenever\nthey are real activities at all. But the inner nature both of efficacy\nand of activity are superficial problems, I understand Royce to say; and\nthe only point for us in solving them would be their possible use in\nhelping us to solve the far deeper problem of the course and meaning of\nthe world of life. Life, says our colleague, is full of significance, of\nmeaning, of success and of defeat, of hoping and of striving, of\nlonging, of desire, and of inner value. It is a total presence that\nembodies worth. To live our own lives better in this presence is the\ntrue reason why we wish to know the elements of things; so even we\npsychologists must end on this pragmatic note.\nThe urgent problems of activity are thus more concrete. They are all\nproblems of the true relation of longer-span to shorter-span activities.\nWhen, for example, a number of 'ideas' (to use the name traditional in\npsychology) grow confluent in a larger field of consciousness, do the\nsmaller activities still co-exist with the wider activities then\nexperienced by the conscious subject? And, if so, do the wide activities\naccompany the narrow ones inertly, or do they exert control? Or do they\nperhaps utterly supplant and replace them and short-circuit their\neffects? Again, when a mental activity-process and a brain-cell series\nof activities both terminate in the same muscular movement, does the\nmental process steer the neural processes or not? Or, on the other hand,\ndoes it independently short-circuit their effects? Such are the\nquestions that we must begin with. But so far am I from suggesting any\ndefinitive answer to such questions, that I hardly yet can put them\nclearly. They lead, however, into that region of panpsychic and\nontologic speculation of which Professors Bergson and Strong have lately\nenlarged the literature in so able and interesting a way.[104] The\nresults of these authors seem in many respects dissimilar, and I\nunderstand than as yet but imperfectly; but I cannot help suspecting\nthat the direction of their work is very promising, and that they have\nthe hunter's instinct for the fruitful trails.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[85] President's Address before the American Psychological Association,\nPhiladelphia Meeting, December, 1904.

I could multiply\nsimilar quotations and would have introduced some of them into my text\nto make it more concrete, save that the mingling of different points of\nview in most of these author's discussions (not in M\u00fcnsterberg's) make\nit impossible to disentangle exactly what they mean. I am sure in any\ncase, to be accused of misrepresenting them totally, even in this note,\nby omission of the context, so the less I name names and the more I\nstick to abstract characterization of a merely possible style of\nopinion, the safer it will be. And apropos of misunderstandings, I may\nadd to this note a complaint on my own account. Professor Stout, in the\nexcellent chapter on 'Mental Activity,' in vol. I of his _Analytic\nPsychology_, takes me to task for identifying spiritual activity with\ncertain muscular feelings and gives quotations to bear him out. They are\nfrom certain paragraphs on 'the Self,' in which my attempt was to show\nwhat the central nucleus of the activities that we call 'ours' is.\n[_Principles of Psychology_, vol. I, pp. 299-305.] I found it in certain\nintracephalic movements which we habitually oppose, as 'subjective,' to\nthe activities of the transcorporeal world. I sought to show that there\nis no direct evidence that we feel the activity of an inner spiritual\nagent as such (I should now say the activity of 'consciousness' as such,\nsee [the first essay], 'Does Consciousness Exist?'). There are, in fact,\nthree distinguishable 'activities' in the field of discussion: the\nelementary activity involved in the mere _that_ of experience, in the\nfact that _something_ is going on, and the farther specification of this\n_something_ into two _whats_, an activity felt as 'ours,' and an\nactivity ascribed to objects. Stout, as I apprehend him, identifies\n'our' activity with that of the total experience-process, and when I\ncircumscribe it as a part thereof, accuses me of treating it as a sort\nof external appendage to itself (Stout: _op. cit._, vol. I, pp.\n162-163), as if I 'separated the activity from the process which is\nactive.' But all the processes in question are active, and their\nactivity is inseparable from their being. My book raised only the\nquestion of _which_ activity deserved the name of 'ours.' So far as we\nare 'persons,' and contrasted and opposed to an 'environment,' movements\nin our body figure as our activities; and I am unable to find any other\nactivities that are ours in this strictly personal sense. There is a\nwider sense in which the whole 'choir of heaven and furniture of the\nearth,' and their activities, are ours, for they are our 'objects.' But\n'we' are here only another name for the total process of experience,\nanother name for all that is, in fact; and I was dealing with the\npersonal and individualized self exclusively in the passages with which\nProfessor Stout finds fault.\nThe individualized self, which I believe to be the only thing properly\ncalled self, is a part of the content of the world experienced. The\nworld experienced (otherwise called the 'field of consciousness')\ncomes at all times with our body as its centre, centre of vision,\ncentre of action, centre of interest. Where the body is is 'here';\nwhen the body acts is 'now'; what the body touches is 'this'; all\nother things are 'there' and 'then' and 'that.' These words of\nemphasized position imply a systematization of things with reference\nto a focus of action and interest which lies in the body; and the\nsystematization is now so instinctive (was it ever not so?) that no\ndeveloped or active experience exists for us at all except in that\nordered form. So far as 'thoughts' and 'feelings' can be active, their\nactivity terminates in the activity of the body, and only through\nfirst arousing its activities can they begin to change those of the\nrest of the world. [Cf. also _A Pluralistic Universe_, p. 344, note 8.\nED.] The body is the storm centre, the origin of co-ordinates, the\nconstant place of stress in all that experience-train. Everything\ncircles round it, and is felt from its point of view. The word 'I,'\nthen, is primarily a noun of position, just like 'this' and 'here.'\nActivities attached to 'this' position have prerogative emphasis, and,\nif activities have feelings, must be felt in a peculiar way. The word\n'my' designates the kind of emphasis. I see no inconsistency whatever\nin defending, on the one hand, 'my' activities as unique and opposed\nto those of outer nature, and, on the other hand, in affirming, after\nintrospection, that they consist in movements in the head. The 'my' of\nthem is the emphasis, the feeling of perspective-interest in which\nthey are dyed.\n[99] [_Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_, sect. VII, part I,\nSelby-Bigge's edition, pp. 65 ff.]\n[100] Page 172.\n[101] Let me not be told that this contradicts [the first essay], 'Does\nConsciousness Exist?' (see especially page 32), in which it was said\nthat while 'thoughts' and 'things' have the same natures, the natures\nwork 'energetically' on each other in the things (fire burns, water\nwets, etc.) but not in the thoughts. Mental activity-trains are composed\nof thoughts, yet their members do work on each other, they check,\nsustain, and introduce. They do so when the activity is merely\nassociational as well as when effort is there. But, and this is my\nreply, they do so by other parts of their nature than those that\nenergize physically. One thought in every developed activity-series is a\ndesire or thought of purpose, and all the other thoughts acquire a\nfeeling tone from their relation of harmony or oppugnancy to this. The\ninterplay of these secondary tones (among which 'interest,'\n'difficulty,' and 'effort' figure) runs the drama in the mental series.\nIn what we term the physical drama these qualities play absolutely no\npart. The subject needs careful working out; but I can see no\ninconsistency.\n[102] I have found myself more than once accused in print of being the\nassertor of a metaphysical principle of activity. Since literary\nmisunderstandings retard the settlement of problems, I should like to\nsay that such an interpretation of the pages I have published on Effort\nand on Will is absolutely foreign to what I meant to express.\n[_Principles of Psychology_, vol. II, ch. XXVI.] I owe all my doctrines\non this subject to Renouvier; and Renouvier, as I understand him, is (or\nat any rate then was) an out and out phenomenist, a denier of 'forces'\nin the most strenuous sense. [Cf. Ch. Renouvier: _Esquisse d'une\nClassification Syst\u00e9matique des Doctrines Philosophiques_ (1885), vol.\nII, pp. 390-392; _Essais de Critique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale_ (1859), vol. II, \u00a7\u00a7 ix,\nxiii. For an acknowledgment of the author's general indebtedness to\nRenouvier, cf. _Some Problems of Philosophy_, p. 165, note. ED.] Single\nclauses in my writing, or sentences read out of their connection, may\npossibly have been compatible with a transphenomenal principle of\nenergy; but I defy anyone to show a single sentence which, taken with\nits context, should be naturally held to advocate that view. The\nmisinterpretation probably arose at first from my defending (after\nRenouvier) the indeterminism of our efforts. 'Free will' was supposed by\nmy critics to involve a supernatural agent. As a matter of plain history\nthe only 'free will' I have ever thought of defending is the character\nof novelty in fresh activity-situations. If an activity-process is the\nform of a whole 'field of consciousness,' and if each field of\nconsciousness is not only in its totality unique (as is now commonly\nadmitted) but has its elements unique (since in that situation they are\nall dyed in the total) then novelty is perpetually entering the world\nand what happens there is not pure _repetition_, as the dogma of the\nliteral uniformity of nature requires. Activity-situations come, in\nshort, each with an original touch. A 'principle' of free will if there\nwere one, would doubtless manifest itself in such phenomena, but I never\nsaw, nor do I now see, what the principle could do except rehearse the\nphenomenon beforehand, or why it ever should be invoked.\n[103] _Mind_, N. S., vol. VI, 1897; cf. pp. 392-393.\n[104] [Cf. _A Pluralistic Universe_, Lect. VI (on Bergson); H. Bergson:\n_Creative Evolution_, trans. by A. Mitchell; C. A. Strong: _Why the Mind\nhas a Body_, ch. XII. ED.]\nVII\nTHE ESSENCE OF HUMANISM[105]\nHumanism is a ferment that has 'come to stay.'[106] It is not a single\nhypothesis or theorem, and it dwells on no new facts. It is rather a\nslow shifting in the philosophic perspective, making things appear as\nfrom a new centre of interest or point of sight. Some writers are\nstrongly conscious of the shifting, others half unconscious, even though\ntheir own vision may have undergone much change. The result is no small\nconfusion in debate, the half-conscious humanists often taking part\nagainst the radical ones, as if they wished to count upon the other\nside.[107]\nIf humanism really be the name for such a shifting of perspective, it\nis obvious that the whole scene of the philosophic stage will change in\nsome degree if humanism prevails. The emphasis of things, their\nforeground and background distribution, their sizes and values, will not\nkeep just the same.[108] If such pervasive consequences be involved in\nhumanism, it is clear that no pains which philosophers may take, first\nin defining it, and then in furthering, checking, or steering its\nprogress, will be thrown away.\nIt suffers badly at present from incomplete definition. Its most\nsystematic advocates, Schiller and Dewey, have published fragmentary\nprograms only; and its bearing on many vital philosophic problems has\nnot been traced except by adversaries who, scenting heresies in advance,\nhave showered blows on doctrines--subjectivism and scepticism, for\nexample--that no good humanist finds it necessary to entertain. By their\nstill greater reticences, the anti-humanists have, in turn, perplexed\nthe humanists. Much of the controversy has involved the word 'truth.' It\nis always good in debate to know your adversary's point of view\nauthentically. But the critics of humanism never define exactly what the\nword 'truth' signifies when they use it themselves. The humanists have\nto guess at their view; and the result has doubtless been much beating\nof the air. Add to all this, great individual differences in both camps,\nand it becomes clear that nothing is so urgently needed, at the stage\nwhich things have reached at present, as a sharper definition by each\nside of its central point of view.\nWhoever will contribute any touch of sharpness will help us to make sure\nof what's what and who is who. Anyone can contribute such a definition,\nand, without it, no one knows exactly where he stands. If I offer my own\nprovisional definition of humanism[109] now and here, others may improve\nit, some adversary may be led to define his own creed more sharply by\nthe contrast, and a certain quickening of the crystallization of general\nopinion may result.\nI\nThe essential service of humanism, as I conceive the situation, is to\nhave seen that _though one part of our experience may lean upon another\npart to make it what it is in any one of several aspects in which it may\nbe considered, experience as a whole is self-containing and leans on\nnothing_.\nSince this formula also expresses the main contention of transcendental\nidealism, it needs abundant explication to make it unambiguous. It\nseems, at first sight, to confine itself to denying theism and\npantheism. But, in fact, it need not deny either; everything would\ndepend on the exegesis; and if the formula ever became canonical, it\nwould certainly develop both right-wing and left-wing interpreters. I\nmyself read humanism theistically and pluralistically. If there be a\nGod, he is no absolute all-experiencer, but simply the experiencer of\nwidest actual conscious span. Read thus, humanism is for me a religion\nsusceptible of reasoned defence, though I am well aware how many minds\nthere are to whom it can appeal religiously only when it has been\nmonistically translated. Ethically the pluralistic form of it takes for\nme a stronger hold on reality than any other philosophy I know of--it\nbeing essentially a _social_ philosophy, a philosophy of '_co_,' in\nwhich conjunctions do the work. But my primary reason for advocating it\nis its matchless intellectual economy. It gets rid, not only of the\nstanding 'problems' that monism engenders ('problem of evil,' 'problem\nof freedom,' and the like), but of other metaphysical mysteries and\nparadoxes as well.\nIt gets rid, for example, of the whole agnostic controversy, by refusing\nto entertain the hypothesis of trans-empirical reality at all. It gets\nrid of any need for an absolute of the Bradleyan type (avowedly sterile\nfor intellectual purposes) by insisting that the conjunctive relations\nfound within experience are faultlessly real. It gets rid of the need of\nan absolute of the Roycean type (similarly sterile) by its pragmatic\ntreatment of the problem of knowledge [a treatment of which I have\nalready given a version in two very inadequate articles].[110] As the\nviews of knowledge, reality and truth imputed to humanism have been\nthose so far most fiercely attacked, it is in regard to these ideas that\na sharpening of focus seems most urgently required. I proceed therefore\nto bring the views which _I_ impute to humanism in these respects into\nfocus as briefly as I can.\nII\nIf the central humanistic thesis, printed above in italics, be accepted,\nit will follow that, if there be any such thing at all as knowing, the\nknower and the object known must both be portions of experience. One\npart of experience must, therefore, either\n(1) Know another part of experience--in other words, parts must, as\nProfessor Woodbridge says,[111] represent _one another_ instead of\nrepresenting realities outside of 'consciousness'--this case is that of\nconceptual knowledge; or else\n(2) They must simply exist as so many ultimate _thats_ or facts of\nbeing, in the first instance; and then, as a secondary complication, and\nwithout doubling up its entitative single-ness, any one and the same\n_that_ must figure alternately as a thing known and as a knowledge of\nthe thing, by reason of two divergent kinds of context into which, in\nthe general course of experience, it gets woven.[112]\nThis second case is that of sense-perception. There is a stage of\nthought that goes beyond common sense, and of it I shall say more\npresently; but the common-sense stage is a perfectly definite\nhalting-place of thought, primarily for purposes of action; and, so long\nas we remain on the common-sense stage of thought, object and subject\n_fuse_ in the fact of 'presentation' or sense-perception--the pen and\nhand which I now _see_ writing, for example, _are_ the physical\nrealities which those words designate. In this case there is no\nself-transcendency implied in the knowing. Humanism, here, is only a\nmore comminuted _Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_.[113]\nIn case (1), on the contrary, the representative experience does\ntranscend itself in knowing the other experience that is its object. No\none can talk of the knowledge of the one by the other without seeing\nthem as numerically distinct entities, of which the one lies beyond the\nother and away from it, along some direction and with some interval,\nthat can be definitely named. But, if the talker be a humanist, he must\nalso see this distance-interval concretely and pragmatically, and\nconfess it to consist of other intervening experiences--of possible\nones, at all events, if not of actual. To call my present idea of my\ndog, for example, cognitive of the real dog means that, as the actual\ntissue of experience is constituted, the idea is capable of leading into\na chain of other experiences on my part that go from next to next and\nterminate at last in vivid sense-perceptions of a jumping, barking,\nhairy body. Those _are_ the real dog, the dog's full presence, for my\ncommon sense. If the supposed talker is a profound philosopher, although\nthey may not _be_ the real dog for him, they _mean_ the real dog, are\npractical substitutes for the real dog, as the representation was a\npractical substitute for them, that real dog being a lot of atoms, say,\nor of mind-stuff, that lie _where_ the sense-perceptions lie in his\nexperience as well as in my own.\nIII\nThe philosopher here stands for the stage of thought that goes beyond\nthe stage of common sense; and the difference is simply that he\n'interpolates' and 'extrapolates,' where common sense does not. For\ncommon sense, two men see the same identical real dog. Philosophy,\nnoting actual differences in their perceptions, points out the duality\nof these latter, and interpolates something between them as a more real\nterminus--first, organs, viscera, etc.; next, cells; then, ultimate\natoms; lastly, mind-stuff perhaps. The original sense-termini of the two\nmen, instead of coalescing with each other and with the real dog-object,\nas at first supposed, are thus held by philosophers to be separated by\ninvisible realities with which, at most, they are conterminous.\nAbolish, now, one of the percipients, and the interpolation changes into\n'extrapolation.' The sense-terminus of the remaining percipient is\nregarded by the philosopher as not quite reaching reality. He has only\ncarried the procession of experiences, the philosopher thinks, to a\ndefinite, because practical, halting-place somewhere on the way towards\nan absolute truth that lies beyond.\nThe humanist sees all the time, however, that there is no absolute\ntranscendency even about the more absolute realities thus conjectured or\nbelieved in. The viscera and cells are only possible percepts following\nupon that of the outer body. The atoms again, though we may never attain\nto human means of perceiving them, are still defined perceptually. The\nmind-stuff itself is conceived as a kind of experience; and it is\npossible to frame the hypothesis (such hypotheses can by no logic be\nexcluded from philosophy) of two knowers of a piece of mind-stuff and\nthe mind-stuff itself becoming 'confluent' at the moment at which our\nimperfect knowing might pass into knowing of a completed type. Even so\ndo you and I habitually represent our two perceptions and the real dog\nas confluent, though only provisionally, and for the common-sense stage\nof thought. If my pen be inwardly made of mind-stuff, there is no\nconfluence _now_ between that mind-stuff and my visual perception of\nthe pen. But conceivably there might come to be such confluence; for, in\nthe case of my hand, the visual sensations and the inward feelings of\nthe hand, its mind-stuff, so to speak, are even now as confluent as any\ntwo things can be.\nThere is, thus, no breach in humanistic epistemology. Whether knowledge\nbe taken as ideally perfected, or only as true enough to pass muster for\npractice, it is hung on one continuous scheme. Reality, howsoever\nremote, is always defined as a terminus within the general possibilities\nof experience; and what knows it is defined as an experience _that\n'represents' it, in the sense of being substitutable for it in our\nthinking_ because it leads to the same associates, _or in the sense of\n'pointing to it'_ through a chain of other experiences that either\nintervene or may intervene.\nAbsolute reality here bears the same relation to sensation as sensation\nbears to conception or imagination. Both are provisional or final\ntermini, sensation being only the terminus at which the practical man\nhabitually stops, while the philosopher projects a 'beyond' in the\nshape of more absolute reality. These termini, for the practical and the\nphilosophical stages of thought respectively, are self-supporting. They\nare not 'true' of anything else, they simply _are_, are _real_. They\n'lean on nothing,' as my italicized formula said. Rather does the whole\nfabric of experience lean on them, just as the whole fabric of the solar\nsystem, including many relative positions, leans, for its absolute\nposition in space, on any one of its constituent stars. Here, again, one\ngets a new _Identit\u00e4tsphilosophie_ in pluralistic form.[114]\nIV\nIf I have succeeded in making this at all clear (though I fear that\nbrevity and abstractness between them may have made me fail), the reader\nwill see that the 'truth' of our mental operations must always be an\nintra-experiential affair. A conception is reckoned true by common sense\nwhen it can be made to lead to a sensation. The sensation, which for\ncommon sense is not so much 'true' as 'real,' is held to be\n_provisionally_ true by the philosopher just in so far as it _covers_\n(abuts at, or occupies the place of) a still more absolutely real\nexperience, in the possibility of which to some remoter experient the\nphilosopher finds reason to believe.\nMeanwhile what actually _does_ count for true to any individual trower,\nwhether he be philosopher or common man, is always a result of his\n_apperceptions_. If a novel experience, conceptual or sensible,\ncontradict too emphatically our pre-existent system of beliefs, in\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred it is treated as false. Only when the\nolder and the newer experiences are congruous enough to mutually\napperceive and modify each other, does what we treat as an advance in\ntruth result. [Having written of this point in an article in reply to\nMr. Joseph's criticism of my humanism, I will say no more about truth\nhere, but refer the reader to that review.[115]] In no case, however,\nneed truth consist in a relation between our experiences and something\narchetypal or trans-experiential. Should we ever reach absolutely\nterminal experiences, experiences in which we all agreed, which were\nsuperseded by no revised continuations, these would not be _true_, they\nwould be _real_, they would simply _be_, and be indeed the angles,\ncorners, and linchpins of all reality, on which the truth of everything\nelse would be stayed. Only such _other_ things as led to these by\nsatisfactory conjunctions would be 'true.' Satisfactory connection of\nsome sort with such termini is all that the word 'truth' means. On the\ncommon-sense stage of thought sense-presentations serve as such termini.\nOur ideas and concepts and scientific theories pass for true only so far\nas they harmoniously lead back to the world of sense.\nI hope that many humanists will endorse this attempt of mine to trace\nthe more essential features of that way of viewing things. I feel almost\ncertain that Messrs. Dewey and Schiller will do so. If the attackers\nwill also take some slight account of it, it may be that discussion will\nbe a little less wide of the mark than it has hitherto been.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[105] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

Les faits mat\u00e9riels, pris dans leur mat\u00e9rialit\u00e9, ne sont pas\n_\u00e9prouv\u00e9s_, ne sont pas objets _d'exp\u00e9rience_, ne se _rapportent_ pas.\nPour qu'ils prennent la forme du syst\u00e8me dans lequel nous nous sentons\nvivre, il faut qu'ils _apparaissent_, et ce fait d'appara\u00eetre, surajout\u00e9\n\u00e0 leur existence brute, s'appelle la conscience que nous en avons, ou\npeut-\u00eatre, selon l'hypoth\u00e8se panpsychiste, qu'ils ont d'eux-m\u00eames.\nVoil\u00e0 ce dualisme inv\u00e9t\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il semble impossible de chasser de notre\nvue du monde. Ce monde peut bien exister en soi, mais nous n'en savons\nrien, car pour nous il est exclusivement un objet d'exp\u00e9rience; et la\ncondition indispensable \u00e0 cet effet, c'est qu'il soit rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 des\nt\u00e9moins, qu'il soit connu par un sujet ou par des sujets spirituels.\nObjet et sujet, voil\u00e0 les deux jambes sans lesquelles il semble que la\nphilosophie ne saurait faire un pas en avant.\nToutes les \u00e9coles sont d'accord l\u00e0-dessus, scolastique, cart\u00e9sianisme,\nkantisme, n\u00e9o-kantisme, tous admettent le dualisme fondamental. Le\npositivisme ou agnosticisme de nos jours, qui se pique de relever des\nsciences naturelles, se donne volontiers, il est vrai, le nom de\nmonisme. Mais ce n'est qu'un monisme verbal. Il pose une r\u00e9alit\u00e9\ninconnue, mais nous dit que cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sente toujours sous deux\n\"aspects,\" un c\u00f4t\u00e9 conscience et un c\u00f4t\u00e9 mati\u00e8re, et ces deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s\ndemeurent aussi irr\u00e9ductibles que les attributs fondamentaux, \u00e9tendue et\npens\u00e9e, du Dieu de Spinoza. Au fond, le monisme contemporain est du\nspinozisme pur.\nOr, comment se repr\u00e9sente-t-on cette conscience dont nous sommes tous si\nport\u00e9s \u00e0 admettre l'existence? Impossible de la d\u00e9finir, nous dit-on,\nmais nous en avons tous une intuition imm\u00e9diate: tout d'abord la\nconscience a conscience d'elle-m\u00eame. Demandez \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne que\nvous rencontrerez, homme ou femme, psychologue ou ignorant, et elle vous\nr\u00e9pondra qu'elle _se sent_ penser, jouir, souffrir, vouloir, tout comme\nelle se sent respirer. Elle per\u00e7oit directement sa vie spirituelle comme\nune esp\u00e8ce de courant int\u00e9rieur, actif, l\u00e9ger, fluide, d\u00e9licat, diaphane\npour ainsi dire, et absolument oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 quoi que ce soit de mat\u00e9riel.\nBref, la vie subjective ne para\u00eet pas seulement \u00eatre une condition\nlogiquement indispensable pour qu'il y ait un monde objectif qui\n_apparaisse_, c'est encore un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'exp\u00e9rience m\u00eame que nous\n\u00e9prouvons directement, au m\u00eame titre que nous \u00e9prouvons notre propre\ncorps.\nId\u00e9es et Choses, comment donc ne pas reconna\u00eetre leur dualisme?\nSentiments et Objets, comment douter de leur h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 absolue?\nLa psychologie soi-disant scientifique admet cette h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 comme\nl'ancienne psychologie spiritualiste l'admettait. Comment ne pas\nl'admettre? Chaque science d\u00e9coupe arbitrairement dans la trame des\nfaits un champ o\u00f9 elle se parque, et dont elle d\u00e9crit et \u00e9tudie le\ncontenu. La psychologie prend justement pour son domaine le champ des\nfaits de conscience. Elle les postule sans les critiquer, elle les\noppose aux faits mat\u00e9riels; et sans critiquer non plus la notion de ces\nderniers, elle les rattache \u00e0 la conscience par le lien myst\u00e9rieux de la\n_connaissance_, de, l'_aperception_ qui, pour elle, est un troisi\u00e8me\ngenre de fait fondamental et ultime. En suivant cette voie, la\npsychologie contemporaine a f\u00eat\u00e9 de grands triomphes. Elle a pu faire\nune esquisse de l'\u00e9volution de la vie consciente, en concevant cette\nderni\u00e8re comme s'adaptant de plus en plus compl\u00e8tement au milieu\nphysique environnant. Elle a pu \u00e9tablir un parall\u00e9lisme dans le\ndualisme, celui des faits psychiques et des \u00e9v\u00e9nements c\u00e9r\u00e9braux. Elle a\nexpliqu\u00e9 les illusions, les hallucinations, et jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point,\nles maladies mentales. Ce sont de beaux progr\u00e8s; mais il reste encore\nbien des probl\u00e8mes. La philosophie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale surtout, qui a pour devoir\nde scruter tous les postulats, trouve des paradoxes et des emp\u00eachements\nl\u00e0 o\u00f9 la science passe outre; et il n'y a que les amateurs de science\npopulaire qui ne sont jamais perplexes. Plus on va au fond des choses,\nplus on trouve d'\u00e9nigmes; et j'avoue pour ma part que depuis que je\nm'occupe s\u00e9rieusement de psychologie, ce vieux dualisme de mati\u00e8re et de\npens\u00e9e, cette h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 pos\u00e9e comme absolue des deux essences, m'a\ntoujours pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s. C'est de quelques-unes de ces\ndifficult\u00e9s que je voudrais maintenant vous entretenir.\nD'abord il y en a une, laquelle, j'en suis convaincu, vous aura frapp\u00e9s\ntous. Prenons la perception ext\u00e9rieure, la sensation directe que nous\ndonnent par exemple les murs de cette salle. Peut-on dire ici que le\npsychique et le physique sont absolument h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes? Au contraire, ils\nsont si peu h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes que si nous nous pla\u00e7ons au point de vue du sens\ncommun; si nous faisons abstraction de toutes les inventions\nexplicatives, des mol\u00e9cules et des ondulations \u00e9th\u00e9r\u00e9es, par exemple,\nqui au fond sont des entit\u00e9s m\u00e9taphysiques; si, en un mot, nous prenons\nla r\u00e9alit\u00e9 na\u00efvement et telle qu'elle nous est donn\u00e9e tout d'abord,\ncette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sensible d'o\u00f9 d\u00e9pendent nos int\u00e9r\u00eats vitaux, et sur\nlaquelle se portent toutes nos actions; eh bien, cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sensible\net la sensation que nous en avons sont, au moment o\u00f9 la sensation se\nproduit, absolument identiques l'une \u00e0 l'autre. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est\nl'aperception m\u00eame. Les mots \"murs de cette salle\" ne signifient que\ncette blancheur fra\u00eeche et sonore qui nous entoure, coup\u00e9e par ces\nfen\u00eatres, born\u00e9e par ces lignes et ces angles. Le physique ici n'a pas\nd'autre contenu que le psychique. Le sujet et l'objet se confondent.\nC'est Berkeley qui le premier a mis cette v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en honneur. _Esse est\npercipi._ Nos sensations ne sont pas de petits duplicats int\u00e9rieurs des\nchoses, elles sont les choses m\u00eames en tant que les choses nous sont\npr\u00e9sentes. Et quoi que l'on veuille penser de la vie absente, cach\u00e9e, et\npour ainsi dire priv\u00e9e, des choses, et quelles que soient les\nconstructions hypoth\u00e9tiques qu'on en fasse, il reste vrai que la vie\npublique des choses, cette actualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente par laquelle elles nous\nconfrontent, d'o\u00f9 d\u00e9rivent toutes nos constructions th\u00e9oriques, et \u00e0\nlaquelle elles doivent toutes revenir et se rattacher sous peine de\nflotter dans l'air et dans l'irr\u00e9el; cette actualit\u00e9, dis-je, est\nhomog\u00e8ne, et non pas seulement homog\u00e8ne, mais num\u00e9riquement une, avec\nune certaine partie de notre vie int\u00e9rieure.\nVoil\u00e0 pour la perception ext\u00e9rieure. Quand on s'adresse \u00e0 l'imagination,\n\u00e0 la m\u00e9moire ou aux facult\u00e9s de repr\u00e9sentation abstraite, bien que les\nfaits soient ici beaucoup plus compliqu\u00e9s, je crois que la m\u00eame\nhomog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 essentielle se d\u00e9gage. Pour simplifier le probl\u00e8me, excluons\nd'abord toute r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sensible. Prenons la pens\u00e9e pure, telle qu'elle\ns'effectue dans le r\u00eave ou la r\u00eaverie, ou dans la m\u00e9moire du pass\u00e9. Ici\nencore, l'\u00e9toffe de l'exp\u00e9rience ne fait-elle pas double emploi, le\nphysique et le psychique ne se confondent-ils pas? Si je r\u00eave d'une\nmontagne d'or, elle n'existe sans doute pas en dehors du r\u00eave, mais\n_dans_ le r\u00eave elle est de nature ou d'essence parfaitement physique,\nc'est _comme_ physique qu'elle m'appara\u00eet. Si en ce moment je me permets\nde me souvenir de ma maison en Am\u00e9rique, et des d\u00e9tails de mon\nembarquement r\u00e9cent pour l'Italie, le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne pur, le fait qui se\nproduit, qu'est-il? C'est, dit-on, ma pens\u00e9e, avec son contenu. Mais\nencore ce contenu, qu'est-il? Il porte la forme d'une partie du monde\nr\u00e9el, partie distante, il est vrai, de six mille kilom\u00e8tres d'espace et\nde six semaines de temps, mais reli\u00e9e \u00e0 la salle o\u00f9 nous sommes par une\nfoule de choses, objets et \u00e9v\u00e9nements, homog\u00e8nes d'une part avec la\nsalle et d'autre part avec l'objet de mes souvenirs.\nCe contenu ne se donne pas comme \u00e9tant d'abord un tout petit fait\nint\u00e9rieur que je projetterais ensuite au loin, il se pr\u00e9sente d'embl\u00e9e\ncomme le fait \u00e9loign\u00e9 m\u00eame. Et l'acte de penser ce contenu, la\nconscience que j'en ai, que sont-ils? Sont-ce au fond autre chose que\ndes mani\u00e8res r\u00e9trospectives de nommer le contenu lui-m\u00eame, lorsqu'on\nl'aura s\u00e9par\u00e9 de tous ces interm\u00e9diaires physiques, et reli\u00e9 \u00e0 un\nnouveau groupe d'associ\u00e9s qui le font rentrer dans ma vie mentale, les\n\u00e9motions par exemple qu'il a \u00e9veill\u00e9es en moi, l'attention que j'y\nporte, mes id\u00e9es de tout \u00e0 l'heure qui l'ont suscit\u00e9 comme souvenir? Ce\nn'est qu'en se rapportant \u00e0 ces derniers associ\u00e9s que le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\narrive \u00e0 \u00eatre class\u00e9 comme _pens\u00e9e_; tant qu'il ne se rapporte qu'aux\npremiers il demeure ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne _objectif_.\nIl est vrai que nous opposons habituellement nos images int\u00e9rieures aux\nobjets, et que nous les consid\u00e9rons comme de petites copies, comme des\ncalques ou doubles, affaiblis, de ces derniers. C'est qu'un objet\npr\u00e9sent a une vivacit\u00e9 et une nettet\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles de l'image.\nIl lui fait ainsi contraste; et pour me servir de l'excellent mot de\nTaine, il lui sert de _r\u00e9ducteur_. Quand les deux sont pr\u00e9sents\nensemble, l'objet prend le premier plan et l'image \"recule,\" devient une\nchose \"absente.\" Mais cet objet pr\u00e9sent, qu'est-il en lui-m\u00eame? De\nquelle \u00e9toffe est-il fait? De la m\u00eame \u00e9toffe que l'image. Il est fait de\n_sensations_; il est chose per\u00e7ue. Son _esse_ est _percipi_, et lui et\nl'image sont g\u00e9n\u00e9riquement homog\u00e8nes.\nSi je pense en ce moment \u00e0 mon chapeau que j'ai laiss\u00e9 tout \u00e0 l'heure au\nvestiaire, o\u00f9 est le dualisme, le discontinu, entre le chapeau pens\u00e9 et\nle chapeau r\u00e9el? C'est d'un vrai _chapeau absent_ que mon esprit\ns'occupe. J'en tiens compte pratiquement comme d'une r\u00e9alit\u00e9. S'il \u00e9tait\npr\u00e9sent sur cette table, le chapeau d\u00e9terminerait un mouvement de ma\nmain: je l'enl\u00e8verais. De m\u00eame ce chapeau con\u00e7u, ce chapeau en id\u00e9e,\nd\u00e9terminera tant\u00f4t la direction de mes pas. J'irai le prendre. L'id\u00e9e\nque j'en ai se continuera jusqu'\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence sensible du chapeau, et\ns'y fondra harmonieusement.\nJe conclus donc que,--bien qu'il y ait un dualisme pratique--puisque les\nimages se distinguent des objets, en tiennent lieu, et nous y m\u00e8nent, il\nn'y a pas lieu de leur attribuer une diff\u00e9rence de nature essentielle.\nPens\u00e9e et actualit\u00e9 sont faites d'une seule et m\u00eame \u00e9toffe, qui est\nl'\u00e9toffe de l'exp\u00e9rience en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nLa psychologie de la perception ext\u00e9rieure nous m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la m\u00eame\nconclusion. Quand j'aper\u00e7ois l'objet devant moi comme une table de telle\nforme, \u00e0 telle distance, on m'explique que ce fait est d\u00fb \u00e0 deux\nfacteurs, \u00e0 une mati\u00e8re de sensation qui me p\u00e9n\u00e8tre par la voie des yeux\net qui donne l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment d'ext\u00e9riorit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, et \u00e0 des id\u00e9es qui se\nr\u00e9veillent, vont \u00e0 la rencontre de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la classent et\nl'interpr\u00e8tent. Mais qui peut faire la part, dans la table concr\u00e8tement\naper\u00e7ue, de ce qui est sensation et de ce qui est id\u00e9e? L'externe et\nl'interne, l'\u00e9tendu et l'in\u00e9tendu, se fusionnent et font un mariage\nindissoluble. Cela rappelle ces panoramas circulaires, o\u00f9 des objets\nr\u00e9els, rochers, herbe, chariots bris\u00e9s, etc., qui occupent l'avant-plan,\nsont si ing\u00e9nieusement reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la toile qui fait le fond, et qui\nrepr\u00e9sente une bataille ou un vaste paysage, que l'on ne sait plus\ndistinguer ce qui est objet de ce qui est peinture. Les coutures et les\njoints sont imperceptibles.\nCela pourrait-il advenir si l'objet et l'id\u00e9e \u00e9taient absolument\ndissemblables de nature?\n*       *       *       *       *\nJe suis convaincu que des consid\u00e9rations pareilles \u00e0 celles que je viens\nd'exprimer auront d\u00e9j\u00e0 suscit\u00e9, chez vous aussi, des doutes au sujet du\ndualisme pr\u00e9tendu.\nEt d'autres raisons de douter surgissent encore. Il y a toute une sph\u00e8re\nd'adjectifs et d'attributs qui ne sont ni objectifs, ni subjectifs d'une\nmani\u00e8re exclusive, mais que nous employons tant\u00f4t d'une mani\u00e8re et\ntant\u00f4t d'une autre, comme si nous nous complaisions dans leur ambigu\u00eft\u00e9.\nJe parle des qualit\u00e9s que nous _appr\u00e9cions_, pour ainsi dire, dans les\nchoses, leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 esth\u00e9tique, moral, leur valeur pour nous. La beaut\u00e9,\npar exemple, o\u00f9 r\u00e9side-t-elle? Est-elle dans la statue, dans la sonate,\nou dans notre esprit? Mon coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 Harvard, George Santayana, a \u00e9crit\nun livre d'esth\u00e9tique,[117] o\u00f9 il appelle la beaut\u00e9 \"le plaisir\nobjectifi\u00e9\"; et en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, c'est bien ici qu'on pourrait parler de\nprojection au dehors. On dit indiff\u00e9remment une chaleur agr\u00e9able, ou une\nsensation agr\u00e9able de chaleur. La raret\u00e9, le pr\u00e9cieux du diamant nous en\nparaissent des qualit\u00e9s essentielles. Nous parlons d'un orage affreux,\nd'un homme ha\u00efssable, d'une action indigne, et nous croyons parler\nobjectivement, bien que ces termes n'expriment que des rapports \u00e0 notre\nsensibilit\u00e9 \u00e9motive propre. Nous disons m\u00eame un chemin p\u00e9nible, un ciel\ntriste, un coucher de soleil superbe. Toute cette mani\u00e8re animiste de\nregarder les choses qui para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on primitive de penser\ndes hommes, peut tr\u00e8s bien s'expliquer (et M. Santayana, dans un autre\nlivre tout r\u00e9cent,[118] l'a bien expliqu\u00e9e ainsi) par l'habitude\nd'attribuer \u00e0 l'objet _tout_ ce que nous ressentons en sa pr\u00e9sence. Le\npartage du subjectif et de l'objectif est le fait d'une r\u00e9flexion tr\u00e8s\navanc\u00e9e, que nous aimons encore ajourner dans beaucoup d'endroits. Quand\nles besoins pratiques ne nous en tirent pas forc\u00e9ment, il semble que\nnous aimons \u00e0 nous bercer dans le vague.\nLes qualit\u00e9s secondes elles-m\u00eames, chaleur, son, lumi\u00e8re, n'ont encore\naujourd'hui qu'une attribution vague. Pour le sens commun, pour la vie\npratique, elles sont absolument objectives, physiques. Pour le\nphysicien, elles sont subjectives. Pour lui, il n'y a que la forme, la\nmasse, le mouvement, qui aient une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure. Pour le\nphilosophe id\u00e9aliste, au contraire, forme et mouvement sont tout aussi\nsubjectifs que lumi\u00e8re et chaleur, et il n'y a que la chose-en-soi\ninconnue, le \"noum\u00e8ne,\" qui jouisse d'une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 extramentale compl\u00e8te.\nNos sensations intimes conservent encore de cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Il y a des\nillusions de mouvement qui prouvent que nos premi\u00e8res sensations de\nmouvement \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es. C'est le monde entier, avec nous, qui se\nmouvait. Maintenant nous distinguons notre propre mouvement de celui des\nobjets qui nous entourent, et parmi les objets nous en distinguons qui\ndemeurent en repos. Mais il est des \u00e9tats de vertige o\u00f9 nous retombons\nencore aujourd'hui dans l'indiff\u00e9renciation premi\u00e8re.\nVous connaissez tous sans doute cette th\u00e9orie qui a voulu faire des\n\u00e9motions des sommes de sensations visc\u00e9rales et musculaires. Elle a\ndonn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 bien des controverses, et aucune opinion n'a encore conquis\nl'unanimit\u00e9 des suffrages. Vous connaissez aussi les controverses sur la\nnature de l'activit\u00e9 mentale. Les uns soutiennent qu'elle est une force\npurement spirituelle que nous sommes en \u00e9tat d'apercevoir imm\u00e9diatement\ncomme telle. Les autres pr\u00e9tendent que ce que nous nommons activit\u00e9\nmentale (effort, attention, par exemple) n'est que le reflet senti de\ncertains effets dont notre organisme est le si\u00e8ge, tensions musculaires\nau cr\u00e2ne et au gosier, arr\u00eat ou passage de la respiration, afflux de\nsang, etc.\nDe quelque mani\u00e8re que se r\u00e9solvent ces controverses, leur existence\nprouve bien clairement une chose, c'est qu'il est tr\u00e8s difficile, ou\nm\u00eame absolument impossible de savoir, par la seule inspection intime de\ncertains ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, s'ils sont de nature physique, occupant de\nl'\u00e9tendue, etc., ou s'ils sont de nature purement psychique et\nint\u00e9rieure. Il nous faut toujours trouver des raisons pour appuyer notre\navis; il nous faut chercher la classification la plus probable du\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne; et en fin de compte il pourrait bien se trouver que toutes\nnos classifications usuelles eussent eu leurs motifs plut\u00f4t dans les\nbesoins de la pratique que dans quelque facult\u00e9 que nous aurions\nd'apercevoir deux essences ultimes et diverses qui composeraient\nensemble la trame des choses. Le corps de chacun de nous offre un\ncontraste pratique presque violent \u00e0 tout le reste du milieu ambiant.\nTout ce qui arrive au dedans de ce corps nous est plus intime et\nimportant que ce qui arrive ailleurs. Il s'identifie avec notre moi, il\nse classe avec lui. Ame, vie, souffle, qui saurait bien les distinguer\nexactement? M\u00eame nos images et nos souvenirs, qui n'agissent sur le\nmonde physique que par le moyen de notre corps, semblent appartenir \u00e0 ce\ndernier. Nous les traitons comme internes, nous les classons avec nos\nsentiments affectifs. Il faut bien avouer, en somme, que la question du\ndualisme de la pens\u00e9e et de la mati\u00e8re est bien loin d'\u00eatre finalement\nr\u00e9solue.\nEt voil\u00e0 termin\u00e9e la premi\u00e8re partie de mon discours. J'ai voulu vous\np\u00e9n\u00e9trer, Mesdames et Messieurs, de mes doutes et de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, aussi\nbien que de l'importance, du probl\u00e8me.\nQuant \u00e0 moi, apr\u00e8s de longues ann\u00e9es d'h\u00e9sitation, j'ai fini par prendre\nmon parti carr\u00e9ment. Je crois que la conscience, telle qu'on se la\nrepr\u00e9sente commun\u00e9ment, soit comme entit\u00e9, soit comme activit\u00e9 pure,\nmais en tout cas comme fluide, in\u00e9tendue, diaphane, vide de tout contenu\npropre, mais se connaissant directement elle-m\u00eame, spirituelle enfin, je\ncrois, dis-je, que cette conscience est une pure chim\u00e8re, et que la\nsomme de r\u00e9alit\u00e9s concr\u00e8tes que le mot conscience devrait couvrir,\nm\u00e9rite une toute autre description, description, du reste, qu'une\nphilosophie attentive aux faits et sachant faire un peu d'analyse,\nserait d\u00e9sormais en \u00e9tat de fournir ou plut\u00f4t de commencer \u00e0 fournir. Et\nces mots m'am\u00e8nent \u00e0 la seconde partie de mon discours. Elle sera\nbeaucoup plus courte que la premi\u00e8re, parce que si je la d\u00e9veloppais sur\nla m\u00eame \u00e9chelle, elle serait beaucoup trop longue. Il faut, par\ncons\u00e9quent, que je me restreigne aux seules indications indispensables.\n*       *       *       *       *\nAdmettons que la conscience, la _Bewusstheit_, con\u00e7ue comme essence,\nentit\u00e9, activit\u00e9, moiti\u00e9 irr\u00e9ductible de chaque exp\u00e9rience, soit\nsupprim\u00e9e, que le dualisme fondamental et pour ainsi dire ontologique\nsoit aboli et que ce que nous supposions exister soit seulement ce qu'on\na appel\u00e9 jusqu'ici le _contenu_, le _Inhalt_, de la conscience; comment\nla philosophie va-t-elle se tirer d'affaire avec l'esp\u00e8ce de monisme\nvague qui en r\u00e9sultera? Je vais t\u00e2cher de vous insinuer quelques\nsuggestions positives l\u00e0-dessus, bien que je craigne que, faute du\nd\u00e9veloppement n\u00e9cessaire, mes id\u00e9es ne r\u00e9pandront pas une clart\u00e9 tr\u00e8s\ngrande. Pourvu que j'indique un commencement de sentier, ce sera\npeut-\u00eatre assez.\nAu fond, pourquoi nous accrochons-nous d'une mani\u00e8re si tenace \u00e0 cette\nid\u00e9e d'une conscience surajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l'existence du contenu des choses?\nPourquoi la r\u00e9clamons-nous si fortement, que celui qui la nierait nous\nsemblerait plut\u00f4t un mauvais plaisant qu'un penseur? N'est-ce pas pour\nsauver ce fait ind\u00e9niable que le contenu de l'exp\u00e9rience n'a pas\nseulement une existence propre et comme immanente et intrins\u00e8que, mais\nque chaque partie de ce contenu d\u00e9teint pour ainsi dire sur ses\nvoisines, rend compte d'elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 d'autres, sort en quelque sorte de\nsoi pour \u00eatre sue et qu'ainsi tout le champ de l'exp\u00e9rience se trouve\n\u00eatre transparent de part en part, ou constitu\u00e9 comme un espace qui\nserait rempli de miroirs?\nCette bilat\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des parties de l'exp\u00e9rience,--\u00e0 savoir d'une part,\nqu'elles _sont_ avec des qualit\u00e9s propres; d'autre part, qu'elles sont\nrapport\u00e9es \u00e0 d'autres parties et _sues_--l'opinion r\u00e9gnante la constate\net l'explique par un dualisme fondamental de constitution appartenant \u00e0\nchaque morceau d'exp\u00e9rience en propre. Dans cette feuille de papier il\nn'y a pas seulement, dit-on, le contenu, blancheur, minceur, etc., mais\nil y a ce second fait de la conscience de cette blancheur et de cette\nminceur. Cette fonction d'\u00eatre \"rapport\u00e9,\" de faire partie de la trame\nenti\u00e8re d'une exp\u00e9rience plus compr\u00e9hensive, on l'\u00e9rige en fait\nontologique, et on loge ce fait dans l'int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame du papier, en\nl'accouplant \u00e0 sa blancheur et \u00e0 sa minceur. Ce n'est pas un rapport\nextrins\u00e8que qu'on suppose, c'est une moiti\u00e9 du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne m\u00eame.\nJe crois qu'en somme on se repr\u00e9sente la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 comme constitu\u00e9e de la\nfa\u00e7on dont sont faites les \"couleurs\" qui nous servent \u00e0 la peinture. Il\ny a d'abord des mati\u00e8res colorantes qui r\u00e9pondent au contenu, et il y a\nun v\u00e9hicule, huile ou colle, qui les tient en suspension et qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0\nla conscience. C'est un dualisme complet, o\u00f9, en employant certains\nproc\u00e9d\u00e9s, on peut s\u00e9parer chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'autre par voie de\nsoustraction. C'est ainsi qu'on nous assure qu'en faisant un grand\neffort d'abstraction introspective, nous pouvons saisir notre\nconscience sur le vif, comme une activit\u00e9 spirituelle pure, en\nn\u00e9gligeant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s compl\u00e8tement les mati\u00e8res qu'\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9\nelle \u00e9claire.\nMaintenant je vous demande si on ne pourrait pas tout aussi bien\nrenverser absolument cette mani\u00e8re de voir. Supposons, en effet, que la\nr\u00e9alit\u00e9 premi\u00e8re soit de nature neutre, et appelons-la par quelque nom\nencore ambigu, comme _ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne_, _donn\u00e9_, _Vorfindung_. Moi-m\u00eame j'en\nparle volontiers au pluriel, et je lui donne le nom d'_exp\u00e9riences\npures_. Ce sera un monisme, si vous voulez, mais un monisme tout \u00e0 fait\nrudimentaire et absolument oppos\u00e9 au soi-disant monisme bilat\u00e9ral du\npositivisme scientifique ou spinoziste.\nCes exp\u00e9riences pures existent et se succ\u00e8dent, entrent dans des\nrapports infiniment vari\u00e9s les unes avec les autres, rapports qui sont\neux-m\u00eames des parties essentielles de la trame des exp\u00e9riences. Il y a\n\"Conscience\" de ces rapports au m\u00eame titre qu'il y a \"Conscience\" de\nleurs termes. Il en r\u00e9sulte que des _groupes_ d'exp\u00e9riences se font\nremarquer et distinguer, et qu'une seule et m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience, vu la\ngrande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses rapports, peut jouer un r\u00f4le dans plusieurs\ngroupes \u00e0 la fois. C'est ainsi que dans un certain contexte de voisins,\nelle serait class\u00e9e comme un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne physique, tandis que dans un\nautre entourage elle figurerait comme un fait de conscience, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s\ncomme une m\u00eame particule d'encre peut appartenir simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 deux\nlignes, l'une verticale, l'autre horizontale, pourvu qu'elle soit situ\u00e9e\n\u00e0 leur intersection.\nPrenons, pour fixer nos id\u00e9es, l'exp\u00e9rience que nous avons \u00e0 ce moment\ndu local o\u00f9 nous sommes, de ces murailles, de cette table, de ces\nchaises, de cet espace. Dans cette exp\u00e9rience pleine, concr\u00e8te et\nindivise, telle qu'elle est l\u00e0, donn\u00e9e, le monde physique objectif et le\nmonde int\u00e9rieur et personnel de chacun de nous se rencontrent et se\nfusionnent comme des lignes se fusionnent \u00e0 leur intersection. Comme\nchose physique, cette salle a des rapports avec tout le reste du\nb\u00e2timent, b\u00e2timent que nous autres nous ne connaissons et ne conna\u00eetrons\npas. Elle doit son existence \u00e0 toute une histoire de financiers,\nd'architectes, d'ouvriers. Elle p\u00e8se sur le sol; elle durera\nind\u00e9finiment dans le temps; si le feu y \u00e9clatait, les chaises et la\ntable qu'elle contient seraient vite r\u00e9duites en cendres.\nComme exp\u00e9rience personnelle, au contraire, comme chose \"rapport\u00e9e,\"\nconnue, consciente, cette salle a de tout autres tenants et\naboutissants. Ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents ne sont pas des ouvriers, ce sont nos\npens\u00e9es respectives de tout \u00e0 l'heure. Bient\u00f4t elle ne figurera que\ncomme un fait fugitif dans nos biographies, associ\u00e9 \u00e0 d'agr\u00e9ables\nsouvenirs. Comme exp\u00e9rience psychique, elle n'a aucun poids, son\nameublement n'est pas combustible. Elle n'exerce de force physique que\nsur nos seuls cerveaux, et beaucoup d'entre nous nient encore cette\ninfluence; tandis que la salle physique est en rapport d'influence\nphysique avec tout le reste du monde.\nEt pourtant c'est de la m\u00eame salle absolument qu'il s'agit dans les deux\ncas. Tant que nous ne faisons pas de physique sp\u00e9culative, tant que\nnous nous pla\u00e7ons dans le sens commun, c'est la salle vue et sentie qui\nest bien la salle physique. De quoi parlons-nous donc si ce n'est de\n_cela_, de cette m\u00eame partie de la nature mat\u00e9rielle que tous nos\nesprits, \u00e0 ce m\u00eame moment, embrassent, qui entre telle quelle dans\nl'exp\u00e9rience actuelle et intime de chacun de nous, et que notre souvenir\nregardera toujours comme une partie int\u00e9grante de notre histoire. C'est\nabsolument une m\u00eame \u00e9toffe qui figure simultan\u00e9ment, selon le contexte\nque l'on consid\u00e8re, comme fait mat\u00e9riel et physique, ou comme fait de\nconscience intime.\nJe crois donc qu'on ne saurait traiter conscience et mati\u00e8re comme \u00e9tant\nd'essence disparate. On n'obtient ni l'une ni l'autre par soustraction,\nen n\u00e9gligeant chaque fois l'autre moiti\u00e9 d'une exp\u00e9rience de composition\ndouble. Les exp\u00e9riences sont au contraire primitivement de nature plut\u00f4t\nsimple. Elles _deviennent_ conscientes dans leur entier, elles\n_deviennent_ physiques dans leur entier; et c'est _par voie d'addition_\nque ce r\u00e9sultat se r\u00e9alise. Pour autant que des exp\u00e9riences se\nprolongent dans le temps, entrent dans des rapports d'influence\nphysique, se brisant, se chauffant, s'\u00e9clairant, etc., mutuellement,\nnous en faisons un groupe \u00e0 part que nous appelons le monde physique.\nPour autant, au contraire, qu'elles sont fugitives, inertes\nphysiquement, que leur succession ne suit pas d'ordre d\u00e9termin\u00e9, mais\nsemble plut\u00f4t ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des caprices \u00e9motifs, nous en faisons un autre\ngroupe que nous appelons le monde psychique. C'est en entrant \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\ndans un grand nombre de ces groupes psychiques que cette salle devient\nmaintenant chose consciente, chose rapport\u00e9e, chose sue. En faisant\nd\u00e9sormais partie de nos biographies respectives, elle ne sera pas suivie\nde cette sotte et monotone r\u00e9p\u00e9tition d'elle-m\u00eame dans le temps qui\ncaract\u00e9rise son existence physique. Elle sera suivie, au contraire, par\nd'autres exp\u00e9riences qui seront discontinues avec elle, ou qui auront ce\ngenre tout particulier de continuit\u00e9 que nous appelons souvenir. Demain,\nelle aura eu sa place dans chacun de nos pass\u00e9s; mais les pr\u00e9sents\ndivers auxquels tous ces pass\u00e9s seront li\u00e9s demain seront bien\ndiff\u00e9rents du pr\u00e9sent dont cette salle jouira demain comme entit\u00e9\nphysique.\nLes deux genres de groupes sont form\u00e9s d'exp\u00e9riences, mais les rapports\ndes exp\u00e9riences entre elles diff\u00e8rent d'un groupe \u00e0 l'autre. C'est donc\npar addition d'autres ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes qu'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne donn\u00e9 devient conscient\nou connu, ce n'est pas par un d\u00e9doublement d'essence int\u00e9rieure. La\nconnaissance des choses leur _survient_, elle ne leur est pas immanente.\nCe n'est le fait ni d'un moi transcendental, ni d'une _Bewusstheit_ ou\nacte de conscience qui les animerait chacune. _Elles se connaissent\nl'une l'autre_, ou plut\u00f4t il y en a qui connaissent les autres; et le\nrapport que nous nommons connaissance n'est lui-m\u00eame, dans beaucoup de\ncas, qu'une suite d'exp\u00e9riences interm\u00e9diaires parfaitement susceptibles\nd'\u00eatre d\u00e9crites en termes concrets. Il n'est nullement le myst\u00e8re\ntranscendant o\u00f9 se sont complus tant de philosophes.\nMais ceci nous m\u00e8nerait beaucoup trop loin. Je ne puis entrer ici dans\ntous les replis de la th\u00e9orie de la connaissance, ou de ce que, vous\nautres Italiens, vous appelez la gnos\u00e9ologie. Je dois me contenter de\nces remarques \u00e9court\u00e9es, ou simples suggestions, qui sont, je le crains,\nencore bien obscures faute des d\u00e9veloppements n\u00e9cessaires.\nPermettez donc que je me r\u00e9sume--trop sommairement, et en style\ndogmatique--dans les six th\u00e8ses suivantes:\n*       *       *       *       *\n_1^o La Conscience, telle qu'on l'entend ordinairement, n'existe pas,\npas plus que la Mati\u00e8re, \u00e0 laquelle Berkeley a donn\u00e9 le coup de gr\u00e2ce;_\n_2^o Ce qui existe et forme la part de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 que le mot de \"Conscience\"\nrecouvre, c'est la susceptibilit\u00e9 que poss\u00e8dent les parties de\nl'exp\u00e9rience d'\u00eatre rapport\u00e9es ou connues;_\n_3^o Cette susceptibilit\u00e9 s'explique par le fait que certaines\nexp\u00e9riences peuvent mener les unes aux autres par des exp\u00e9riences\ninterm\u00e9diaires nettement caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es, de telle sorte que les unes se\ntrouvent jouer le r\u00f4le de choses connues, les autres celui de sujets\nconnaissants;_\n_4^o On peut parfaitement d\u00e9finir ces deux r\u00f4les sans sortir de la\ntrame de l'exp\u00e9rience m\u00eame, et sans invoquer rien de transcendant;_\n_5^o Les attributions sujet et objet, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et repr\u00e9sentatif, chose\net pens\u00e9e, signifient donc une distinction pratique qui est de la\nderni\u00e8re importance, mais qui est d'ordre_ FONCTIONNEL _seulement, et\nnullement ontologique comme le dualisme classique se la repr\u00e9sente;_\n_6^o En fin de compte, les choses et les pens\u00e9es ne sont point\nfonci\u00e8rement h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes, mais elles sont faites d'une m\u00eame \u00e9toffe,\n\u00e9toffe qu'on ne peut d\u00e9finir comme telle, mais seulement \u00e9prouver, et\nque l'on peut nommer, si on veut, l'\u00e9toffe de l'exp\u00e9rience en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral._\nFOOTNOTES:\n[116] [A communication made (in French) at the Fifth International\nCongress of Psychology, in Rome, April 30, 1905.

[The series of articles referred to\nis reprinted above. ED.]\n[117] _The Sense of Beauty_, pp. 44 ff.\n[118] _The Life of Reason_ [vol. I, \"Reason in Common Sense,\" p. 142].\nIX\nIS RADICAL EMPIRICISM SOLIPSISTIC?[119]\nIf all the criticisms which the humanistic _Weltanschauung_ is receiving\nwere as _sachgem\u00e4ss_ as Mr. Bode's,[120] the truth of the matter would\nmore rapidly clear up. Not only is it excellently well written, but it\nbrings its own point of view out clearly, and admits of a perfectly\nstraight reply.\nThe argument (unless I fail to catch it) can be expressed as follows:\nIf a series of experiences be supposed, no one of which is endowed\nimmediately with the self-transcendent function of reference to a\nreality beyond itself, no motive will occur within the series for\nsupposing anything beyond it to exist. It will remain subjective, and\ncontentedly subjective, both as a whole and in its several parts.\nRadical empiricism, trying, as it does, to account for objective\nknowledge by means of such a series, egregiously fails. It can not\nexplain how the notion of a physical order, as distinguished from a\nsubjectively biographical order, of experiences, ever arose.\nIt pretends to explain the notion of a physical order, but does so by\nplaying fast and loose with the concept of objective reference. On the\none hand, it denies that such reference implies self-transcendency on\nthe part of any one experience; on the other hand, it claims that\nexperiences _point_. But, critically considered, there can be no\npointing unless self-transcendency be also allowed. The conjunctive\nfunction of pointing, as I have assumed it, is, according to my critic,\nvitiated by the fallacy of attaching a bilateral relation to a term _a\nquo_, as if it could stick out substantively and maintain itself in\nexistence in advance of the term _ad quem_ which is equally required for\nit to be a concretely experienced fact. If the relation be made\nconcrete, the term _ad quem_ is involved, which would mean (if I succeed\nin apprehending Mr. Bode rightly) that this latter term, although not\nempirically there, is yet _noetically_ there, in advance--in other words\nit would mean that any experience that 'points' must already have\ntranscended itself, in the ordinary 'epistemological' sense of the word\ntranscend.\nSomething like this, if I understand Mr. Bode's text, is the upshot of\nhis state of mind. It is a reasonable sounding state of mind, but it is\nexactly the state of mind which radical empiricism, by its doctrine of\nthe reality of conjunctive relations, seeks to dispel. I very much\nfear--so difficult does mutual understanding seem in these exalted\nregions--that my able critic has failed to understand that doctrine as\nit is meant to be understood. I suspect that he performs on all these\nconjunctive relations (of which the aforesaid 'pointing' is only one)\nthe usual rationalistic act of substitution--he takes them not as they\nare given in their first intention, as parts constitutive of\nexperience's living flow, but only as they appear in retrospect, each\nfixed as a determinate object of conception, static, therefore, and\ncontained within itself.\nAgainst this rationalistic tendency to treat experience as chopped up\ninto discontinuous static objects, radical empiricism protests. It\ninsists on taking conjunctions at their 'face-value,' just as they come.\nConsider, for example, such conjunctions as 'and,' 'with,' 'near,'\n'_plus_,' 'towards.' While we live in such conjunctions our state is one\nof _transition_ in the most literal sense. We are expectant of a 'more'\nto come, and before the more _has_ come, the transition, nevertheless,\nis directed _towards_ it. I fail otherwise to see how, if one kind of\nmore comes, there should be satisfaction and feeling of fulfilment; but\ndisappointment if the more comes in another shape. One more will\ncontinue, another more will arrest or deflect the direction, in which\nour experience is moving even now. We can not, it is true, _name_ our\ndifferent living 'ands' or 'withs' except by naming the different terms\ntowards which they are moving us, but we _live_ their specifications and\ndifferences before those terms explicitly arrive. Thus, though the\nvarious 'ands' are all bilateral relations, each requiring a term _ad\nquem_ to define it when viewed in retrospect and articulately conceived,\nyet in its living moment any one of them may be treated as if it 'stuck\nout' from its term _a quo_ and pointed in a special direction, much as a\ncompass-needle (to use Mr. Bode's excellent simile) points at the pole,\neven though it stirs not from its box.\nIn Professor H\u00f6ffding's massive little article in _The Journal of\nPhilosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods_,[121] he quotes a saying\nof Kierkegaard's to the effect that we live forwards, but we understand\nbackwards. Understanding backwards is, it must be confessed, a very\nfrequent weakness of philosophers, both of the rationalistic and of the\nordinary empiricist type. Radical empiricism alone insists on\nunderstanding forwards also, and refuses to substitute static concepts\nof the understanding for transitions in our moving life. A logic similar\nto that which my critic seems to employ here should, it seems to me,\nforbid him to say that our present is, while present, directed towards\nour future, or that any physical movement can have direction until its\ngoal is actually reached.\nAt this point does it not seem as if the quarrel about\nself-transcendency in knowledge might drop? Is it not a purely verbal\ndispute? Call it self-transcendency or call it pointing, whichever you\nlike--it makes no difference so long as real transitions towards real\ngoals are admitted as things given _in_ experience, and among\nexperience's most indefeasible parts. Radical empiricism, unable to\nclose its eyes to the transitions caught _in actu_, accounts for the\nself-transcendency or the pointing (whichever you may call it) as a\nprocess that occurs within experience, as an empirically mediated thing\nof which a perfectly definite description can be given. 'Epistemology,'\non the other hand, denies this; and pretends that the self-transcendency\nis unmediated or, if mediated, then mediated in a super-empirical world.\nTo justify this pretension, epistemology has first to transform all our\nconjunctions into static objects, and this, I submit, is an absolutely\narbitrary act. But in spite of Mr. Bode's mal-treatment of conjunctions,\nas I understand them--and as I understand him--I believe that at bottom\nwe are fighting for nothing different, but are both defending the same\ncontinuities of experience in different forms of words.\nThere are other criticisms in the article in question, but, as this\nseems the most vital one, I will for the present, at any rate, leave\nthem untouched.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[119] [Reprinted from _The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

PITKIN'S REFUTATION OF 'RADICAL EMPIRICISM'[122]\nAlthough Mr. Pitkin does not name me in his acute article on radical\nempiricism,[123] [...] I fear that some readers, knowing me to have\napplied that name to my own doctrine, may possibly consider themselves\nto have been in at my death.\nIn point of fact my withers are entirely unwrung. I have, indeed,\nsaid[124] that 'to be radical, an empiricism must not admit into its\nconstructions any element that is not directly experienced.' But in my\nown radical empiricism this is only a _methodological postulate_, not a\nconclusion supposed to flow from the intrinsic absurdity of\ntransempirical objects. I have never felt the slightest respect for the\nidealistic arguments which Mr. Pitkin attacks and of which Ferrier made\nsuch striking use; and I am perfectly willing to admit any number of\nnoumenal beings or events into philosophy if only their pragmatic value\ncan be shown.\nRadical empiricism and pragmatism have so many misunderstandings to\nsuffer from, that it seems my duty not to let this one go any farther,\nuncorrected.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMr. Pitkin's 'reply' to me,[125] [...] perplexes me by the obscurity of\nstyle which I find in almost all our younger philosophers. He asks me,\nhowever, two direct questions which I understand, so I take the liberty\nof answering.\nFirst he asks: Do not experience and science show 'that countless things\nare[126] experienced as that which they are not or are only partially?'\nI reply: Yes, assuredly, as, for example, 'things' distorted by\nrefractive media, 'molecules,' or whatever else is taken to be more\nultimately real than the immediate content of the perceptive moment.\nSecondly: \"If experience is self-supporting[127] (in _any_ intelligible\nsense) does this fact preclude the possibility of (a) something not\nexperienced and (b) action of experience upon a noumenon?\"\nMy reply is: Assuredly not the possibility of either--how could it? Yet\nin my opinion we should be wise not to _consider_ any thing or action of\nthat nature, and to restrict our universe of philosophic discourse to\nwhat is experienced or, at least, experienceable.[128]\nFOOTNOTES:\n[122] [Reprinted from the _Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and\nScientific Methods_, vol.

ED.]\nXI\nHUMANISM AND TRUTH ONCE MORE.[129]\nMr. Joseph's criticism of my article 'Humanism and Truth'[130] is a\nuseful contribution to the general clearing up. He has seriously tried\nto comprehend what the pragmatic movement may intelligibly mean; and if\nhe has failed, it is the fault neither of his patience nor of his\nsincerity, but rather of stubborn tricks of thought which he could not\neasily get rid of. Minute polemics, in which the parties try to rebut\nevery detail of each of the other's charges, are a useful exercise only\nto the disputants. They can but breed confusion in a reader. I will\ntherefore ignore as much as possible the text of both our articles (mine\nwas inadequate enough) and treat once more the general objective\nsituation.\nAs I apprehend the movement towards humanism, it is based on no\nparticular discovery or principle that can be driven into one precise\nformula which thereupon can be impaled upon a logical skewer. It is much\nmore like one of those secular changes that come upon public opinion\nover-night, as it were, borne upon tides 'too full for sound or foam,'\nthat survive all the crudities and extravagances of their advocates,\nthat you can pin to no one absolutely essential statement, nor kill by\nany one decisive stab.\nSuch have been the changes from aristocracy to democracy, from classic\nto romantic taste, from theistic to pantheistic feeling, from static to\nevolutionary ways of understanding life--changes of which we all have\nbeen spectators. Scholasticism still opposes to such changes the method\nof confutation by single decisive reasons, showing that the new view\ninvolves self-contradiction, or traverses some fundamental principle.\nThis is like stopping a river by planting a stick in the middle of its\nbed. Round your obstacle flows the water and 'gets there all the same.'\nIn reading Mr. Joseph, I am not a little reminded of those Catholic\nwriters who refute Darwinism by telling us that higher species can not\ncome from lower because _minus nequit gignere plus_, or that the notion\nof transformation is absurd, for it implies that species tend to their\nown destruction, and that would violate the principle that every reality\ntends to persevere in its own shape. The point of view is too myopic,\ntoo tight and close to take in the inductive argument. You can not\nsettle questions of fact by formal logic. I feel as if Mr. Joseph almost\npounced on my words singly, without giving the sentences time to get out\nof my mouth.\nThe one condition of understanding humanism is to become\ninductive-minded oneself, to drop rigorous definitions, and follow lines\nof least resistance 'on the whole.' \"In other words,\" Mr. Joseph may\nprobably say, \"resolve your intellect into a kind of slush.\" \"Even so,\"\nI make reply,--\"if you will consent to use no politer word.\" For\nhumanism, conceiving the more 'true' as the more 'satisfactory' (Dewey's\nterm) has to renounce sincerely rectilinear arguments and ancient ideals\nof rigor and finality. It is in just this temper of renunciation, so\ndifferent from that of pyrrhonistic scepticism, that the spirit of\nhumanism essentially consists. Satisfactoriness has to be measured by a\nmultitude of standards, of which some, for aught we know, may fail in\nany given case; and what is 'more' satisfactory than any alternative in\nsight, may to the end be a sum of _pluses_ and _minuses_, concerning\nwhich we can only trust that by ulterior corrections and improvements a\nmaximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day be\napproached. It means a real change of heart, a break with absolutistic\nhopes, when one takes up this view of the conditions of belief.\nThat humanism's critics have never imagined this attitude inwardly, is\nshown by their invariable tactics. They do not get into it far enough to\nsee objectively and from without what their own opposite notion of\ntruth is. Mr. Joseph is possessed by some such notion; he thinks his\nreaders to be full of it, he obeys it, works from it, but never even\nessays to tell us what it is. The nearest he comes to doing so is\nwhere[131] he says it is the way \"we ought to think,\" whether we be\npsychologically compelled to or not.\nOf course humanism agrees to this: it is only a manner of calling truth\nan ideal. But humanism explicates the summarizing word 'ought' into a\nmass of pragmatic motives from the midst of which our critics think that\ntruth itself takes flight. Truth is a name of double meaning. It stands\nnow for an abstract something defined only as that to which our thought\nought to conform; and again it stands for the concrete propositions\nwithin which we believe that conformity already reigns--they being so\nmany 'truths.' Humanism sees that the only conformity we ever have to\ndeal with concretely is that between our subjects and our predicates,\nusing these words in a very broad sense. It sees moreover that this\nconformity is 'validated' (to use Mr. Schiller's term) by an indefinite\nnumber of pragmatic tests that vary as the predicates and subjects vary.\nIf an S gets superseded by an SP that gives our mind a completer sum of\nsatisfactions, we always say, humanism points out, that we have advanced\nto a better position in regard to truth.\nNow many of our judgments thus attained are retrospective. The S'es, so\nthe judgment runs, were SP's already ere the fact was humanly recorded.\nCommon sense, struck by this state of things, now rearranges the whole\nfield; and traditional philosophy follows her example. The general\nrequirement that predicates must conform to their subject, they\ntranslate into an ontological theory. A most previous Subject of all is\nsubstituted for the lesser subjects and conceived of as an archetypal\nReality; and the conformity required of predicates in detail is\nreinterpreted as a relation which our whole mind, with all its subjects\nand predicates together, must get into with respect to this Reality.\nIt, meanwhile, is conceived as eternal, static, and unaffected by our\nthinking. Conformity to a non-human Archetype like this is probably the\nnotion of truth which my opponent shares with common sense and\nphilosophic rationalism.\nWhen now Humanism, fully admitting both the naturalness and the grandeur\nof this hypothesis, nevertheless points to its sterility, and declines\nto chime in with the substitution, keeping to the concrete and still\nlodging truth between the subjects and the predicates in detail, it\nprovokes the outcry which we hear and which my critic echoes.\nOne of the commonest parts of the outcry is that humanism is\nsubjectivistic altogether--it is supposed to labor under a necessity of\n'denying trans-perceptual reality.'[132] It is not hard to see how this\nmisconception of humanism may have arisen; and humanistic writers,\npartly from not having sufficiently guarded their expressions, and\npartly from not having yet \"got round\" (in the poverty of their\nliterature) to a full discussion of the subject, are doubtless in some\ndegree to blame. But I fail to understand how any one with a working\ngrasp of their principles can charge them wholesale with subjectivism. I\nmyself have never thought of humanism as being subjectivistic farther\nthan to this extent, that, inasmuch as it treats the thinker as being\nhimself one portion of reality, it must also allow that _some_ of the\nrealities that he declares for true are created by his being there. Such\nrealities of course are either acts of his, or relations between other\nthings and him, or relations between things, which, but for him, would\nnever have been traced. Humanists are subjectivistic, also in this,\nthat, unlike rationalists (who think they carry a warrant for the\nabsolute truth of what they now believe in in their present pocket),\nthey hold all present beliefs as subject to revision in the light of\nfuture experience. The future experience, however, may be of things\noutside the thinker; and that this is so the humanist may believe as\nfreely as any other kind of empiricist philosopher.\nThe critics of humanism (though here I follow them but darkly) appear to\nobject to any infusion whatever of subjectivism into truth. All must be\narchetypal; every truth must pre-exist to its perception. Humanism sees\nthat an enormous quantity of truth must be written down as having\npre-existed to its perception by us humans. In countless instances we\nfind it most satisfactory to believe that, though we were always\nignorant of the fact, it always _was_ a fact that S was SP. But humanism\nseparates this class of cases from those in which it is more\nsatisfactory to believe the opposite, e.g., that S is ephemeral, or P a\npassing event, or SP created by the perceiving act. Our critics seem on\nthe other hand, to wish to universalize the retrospective type of\ninstance. Reality must pre-exist to every assertion for which truth is\nclaimed. And, not content with this overuse of one particular type of\njudgment, our critics claim its monopoly. They appear to wish to cut off\nHumanism from its rights to any retrospection at all.\nHumanism says that satisfactoriness is what distinguishes the true from\nthe false. But satisfactoriness is both a subjective quality, and a\npresent one. _Ergo_ (the critics appear to reason) an object, _qu\u00e2_\ntrue, must always for humanism be both present and subjective, and a\nhumanist's belief can never be in anything that lives outside of the\nbelief itself or ante-dates it. Why so preposterous a charge should be\nso current, I find it hard to say. Nothing is more obvious than the fact\nthat both the objective and the past existence of the object may be the\nvery things about it that most seem satisfactory, and that most invite\nus to believe them. The past tense can figure in the humanist's world,\nas well of belief as of representation, quite as harmoniously as in the\nworld of any one else.\nMr. Joseph gives a special turn to this accusation. He charges me[133]\nwith being self-contradictory when I say that the main categories of\nthought were evolved in the course of experience itself. For I use these\nvery categories to define the course of experience by. Experience, as I\ntalk about it, is a product of their use; and yet I take it as true\nanteriorly to them. This seems to Mr. Joseph to be an absurdity. I hope\nit does not seem such to his readers; for if experiences can suggest\nhypotheses at all (and they notoriously do so) I can see no absurdity\nwhatever in the notion of a retrospective hypothesis having for its\nobject the very train of experiences by which its own being, along with\nthat of other things, has been brought about. If the hypothesis is\n'satisfactory' we must, of course, believe it to have been true\nanteriorly to its formulation by ourselves. Every explanation of a\npresent by a past seems to involve this kind of circle, which is not a\nvicious circle. The past is _causa existendi_ of the present, which in\nturn is _causa cognoscendi_ of the past. If the present were treated as\n_causa existendi_ of the past, the circle might indeed be vicious.\nClosely connected with this pseudo-difficulty is another one of wider\nscope and greater complication--more excusable therefore.[134]\nHumanism, namely, asking how truth in point of fact is reached, and\nseeing that it is by ever substituting more satisfactory for less\nsatisfactory opinions, is thereby led into a vague historic sketch of\ntruth's development. The earliest 'opinions,' it thinks, must have been\ndim, unconnected 'feelings,' and only little by little did more and more\norderly views of things replace them. Our own retrospective view of this\nwhole evolution is now, let us say, the latest candidate for 'truth' as\nyet reached in the process. To be a satisfactory candidate, it must give\nsome definite sort of a picture of what forces keep the process going.\nOn the subjective side we have a fairly definite picture--sensation,\nassociation, interest, hypothesis, these account in a general way for\nthe growth into a cosmos of the relative chaos with which the mind\nbegan.\nBut on the side of the object, so to call it roughly, our view is much\nless satisfactory. Of which of our many objects are we to believe that\nit truly _was_ there and at work before the human mind began? Time,\nspace, kind, number, serial order, cause, consciousness, are hard things\nnot to objectify--even transcendental idealism leaves them standing as\n'empirically real.' Substance, matter, force, fall down more easily\nbefore criticism, and secondary qualities make almost no resistance at\nall. Nevertheless, when we survey the field of speculation, from\nScholasticism through Kantism to Spencerism, we find an ever-recurring\ntendency to convert the pre-human into a merely logical object, an\nunknowable _ding-an-sich_, that but starts the process, or a vague\n_materia prima_ that but receives our forms.[135]\nThe reasons for this are not so much logical as they are material. We\ncan postulate an extra-mental _that_ freely enough (though some\nidealists have denied us the privilege), but when we have done so, the\n_what_ of it is hard to determine satisfactorily, because of the\noppositions and entanglements of the variously proposed _whats_ with one\nanother and with the history of the human mind. The literature of\nspeculative cosmology bears witness to this difficulty. Humanism suffers\nfrom it no more than any other philosophy suffers, but it makes all our\ncosmogonic theories so unsatisfactory that some thinkers seek relief in\nthe denial of any primal dualism. Absolute Thought or 'pure experience'\nis postulated, and endowed with attributes calculated to justify the\nbelief that it may 'run itself.' Both these truth-claiming hypotheses\nare non-dualistic in the old mind-and-matter sense; but the one is\nmonistic and the other pluralistic as to the world process itself. Some\nhumanists are non-dualists of this sort--I myself am one _und zwar_ of\nthe pluralistic brand. But doubtless dualistic humanists also exist, as\nwell as non-dualistic ones of the monistic wing.\nMr. Joseph pins these general philosophic difficulties on humanism\nalone, or possibly on me alone. My article spoke vaguely of a 'most\nchaotic pure experience' coming first, and building up the mind.[136]\nBut how can two structureless things interact so as to produce a\nstructure? my critic triumphantly asks. Of course they can't, as purely\nso-named entities. We must make additional hypotheses. We must beg a\nminimum of structure for them. The _kind_ of minimum that _might_ have\ntended to increase towards what we now find actually developed is the\nphilosophical desideratum here. The question is that of the most\nmaterially satisfactory hypothesis. Mr. Joseph handles it by formal\nlogic purely, as if he had no acquaintance with the logic of hypothesis\nat all.\nMr. Joseph again is much bewildered as to what a humanist can mean when\nhe uses the word knowledge. He tries to convict me[137] of vaguely\nidentifying it with any kind of good. Knowledge is a difficult thing to\ndefine briefly, and Mr. Joseph shows his own constructive hand here even\nless than in the rest of his article. I have myself put forth on\nseveral occasions a radically pragmatist account of knowledge,[138] the\nexistence of which account my critic probably does not know of--so\nperhaps I had better not say anything about knowledge until he reads and\nattacks that. I will say, however, that whatever the relation called\nknowing may itself prove to consist in, I can think of no conceivable\nkind of _object_ which may not become an object of knowledge on\nhumanistic principles as well as on the principles of any other\nphilosophy.[139]\nI confess that I am pretty steadily hampered by the habit, on the part\nof humanism's critics, of assuming that they have truer ideas than mine\nof truth and knowledge, the nature of which I must know of and can not\nneed to have re-defined. I have consequently to reconstruct these ideas\nin order to carry on the discussion (I have e.g. had to do so in some\nparts of this article) and I thereby expose myself to charges of\ncaricature. In one part of Mr. Joseph's attack, however, I rejoice that\nwe are free from this embarrassment. It is an important point and covers\nprobably a genuine difficulty, so I take it up last.\nWhen, following Schiller and Dewey, I define the true as that which\ngives the maximal combination of satisfactions, and say that\nsatisfaction is a many-dimensional term that can be realized in various\nways, Mr. Joseph replies, rightly enough, that the chief satisfaction of\na rational creature must always be his thought that what he believes is\n_true_, whether the truth brings him the satisfaction of collateral\nprofits or not. This would seem, however, to make of truth the prior\nconcept, and to relegate satisfaction to a secondary place.\nAgain, if to be satisfactory is what is meant by being true, _whose_\nsatisfactions, and _which_ of his satisfactions, are to count?\nDiscriminations notoriously have to be made; and the upshot is that only\nrational candidates and intellectual satisfactions stand the test. We\nare then driven to a purely theoretic notion of truth, and get out of\nthe pragmatic atmosphere altogether. And with this Mr. Joseph leaves\nus--truth is truth, and there is an end of the matter. But he makes a\nvery pretty show of convicting me of self-stultification in according to\nour purely theoretic satisfactions any place in the humanistic scheme.\nThey crowd the collateral satisfactions out of house and home, he\nthinks, and pragmatism has to go into bankruptcy if she recognizes them\nat all.\nThere is no room for disagreement about the facts here; but the\ndestructive force of the reasoning disappears as soon as we talk\nconcretely instead of abstractly, and ask, in our quality of good\npragmatists, just what the famous theoretic needs are known as and in\nwhat the intellectual satisfactions consist. Mr. Joseph, faithful to the\nhabits of his party, makes no attempt at characterizing them, but\nassumes that their nature is self-evident to all.\nAre they not all mere matters of _consistency_--and emphatically _not_\nof consistency between an Absolute Reality and the mind's copies of it,\nbut of actually felt consistency among judgments, objects, and manners\nof reacting, in the mind? And are not both our need of such consistency\nand our pleasure in it conceivable as outcomes of the natural fact that\nwe are beings that develop mental _habits_--habit itself proving\nadaptively beneficial in an environment where the same objects, or the\nsame kinds of objects, recur and follow 'law'? If this were so, what\nwould have come first would have been the collateral profits of habit,\nand the theoretic life would have grown up in aid of these. In point of\nfact this seems to have been the probable case. At life's origin, any\npresent perception may have been 'true'--if such a word could then be\napplicable. Later, when reactions became organized, the reactions became\n'true' whenever expectation was fulfilled by them. Otherwise they were\n'false' or 'mistaken' reactions. But the same class of objects needs the\nsame kind of reaction, so the impulse to react consistently must\ngradually have been established, with a disappointment felt whenever\nthe results frustrated expectation. Here is a perfectly plausible germ\nfor all our higher consistencies. Nowadays, if an object claims from us\na reaction of the kind habitually accorded only to the opposite class of\nobjects, our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly. The situation is\nintellectually unsatisfactory. To gain relief we seek either to preserve\nthe reaction by re-interpreting the object, or, leaving the object as it\nis, we react in a way contrary to the way claimed of us. Neither\nsolution is easy. Such a situation might be that of Mr. Joseph, with me\nclaiming assent to humanism from him. He can not apperceive it so as to\npermit him to gratify my claim; but there is enough appeal in the claim\nto induce him to write a whole article in justification of his refusal.\nIf he should assent to humanism, on the other hand, that would drag\nafter it an unwelcome, yea incredible, alteration of his previous mental\nbeliefs. Whichever alternative he might adopt, however, a new\nequilibrium of intellectual consistency would in the end be reached. He\nwould feel, whichever way he decided, that he was now thinking truly.\nBut if, with his old habits unaltered, he should simply add to them the\nnew one of advocating humanism quietly or noisily, his mind would be\nrent into two systems, each of which would accuse the other of\nfalsehood. The resultant situation, being profoundly unsatisfactory,\nwould also be instable.\nTheoretic truth is thus no relation between our mind and archetypal\nreality. It falls _within_ the mind, being the accord of some of its\nprocesses and objects with other processes and objects--'accord'\nconsisting here in well-definable relations. So long as the satisfaction\nof feeling such an accord is denied us, whatever collateral profits may\nseem to inure from what we believe in are but as dust in the\nbalance--provided always that we are highly organized intellectually,\nwhich the majority of us are not. The amount of accord which satisfies\nmost men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between their\nusual thoughts and statements and the limited sphere of\nsense-perceptions in which their lives are cast. The theoretic truth\nthat most of us think we 'ought' to attain to is thus the possession of\na set of predicates that do not contradict their subjects. We preserve\nit as often as not by leaving other predicates and subjects out.\nIn some men theory is a passion, just as music is in others. The form of\ninner consistency is pursued far beyond the line at which collateral\nprofits stop. Such men systematize and classify and schematize and make\nsynoptical tables and invent ideal objects for the pure love of\nunifying. Too often the results, glowing with 'truth' for the inventors,\nseem pathetically personal and artificial to bystanders. Which is as\nmuch as to say that the purely theoretic criterion of truth can leave us\nin the lurch as easily as any other criterion.\nI think that if Mr. Joseph will but consider all these things a little\nmore concretely, he may find that the humanistic scheme and the notion\nof theoretic truth fall into line consistently enough to yield him also\nintellectual satisfaction.\nFOOTNOTES:\n[129] [Reprinted without change from _Mind_, N.

Y.,\nNovember 4, 1904.\nXII\nABSOLUTISM AND EMPIRICISM[140]\nNo seeker of truth can fail to rejoice at the terre-\u00e0-terre sort of\ndiscussion of the issues between Empiricism and Transcendentalism (or,\nas the champions of the latter would probably prefer to say, between\nIrrationalism and Rationalism) that seems to have begun in _Mind_.[141]\nIt would seem as if, over concrete examples like Mr. J. S. Haldane's,\nboth parties ought inevitably to come to a better understanding. As a\nreader with a strong bias towards Irrationalism, I have studied his\narticle[142] with the liveliest admiration of its temper and its\npainstaking effort to be clear. But the cases discussed failed to\nsatisfy me, and I was at first tempted to write a Note animadverting\nupon them in detail. The growth of the limb, the sea's contour, the\nvicarious functioning of the nerve-centre, the digitalis curing the\nheart, are unfortunately _not_ cases where we can _see_ any\n_through-and-through_ conditioning of the parts by the whole. They are\nall cases of reciprocity where subjects, supposed independently to\nexist, acquire certain attributes through their relations to other\nsubjects. That they also _exist_ through similar relations is only an\nideal supposition, not verified to our understanding in these or any\nother concrete cases whatsoever.\nIf, however, one were to urge this solemnly, Mr. Haldane's friends could\neasily reply that he only gave us such examples on account of the\nhardness of our hearts. He knew full well their imperfection, but he\nhoped that to those who would not spontaneously ascend to the Notion of\nthe Totality, these cases might prove a spur and suggest and symbolize\nsomething better than themselves. No particular case that can be brought\nforward is a real concrete. They are all abstractions from the Whole,\nand of course the \"through-and-through\" character can not be found in\nthem. Each of them still contains among its elements what we call\n_things_, grammatical subjects, forming a sort of residual _caput\nmortuum_ of Existence after all the relations that figure in the\nexamples have been told off. On this \"existence,\" thinks popular\nphilosophy, things may live on, like the winter bears on their own fat,\nnever entering relations at all, or, if entering them, entering an\nentirely different set of them from those treated of in Mr. Haldane's\nexamples. Thus _if_ the digitalis were to weaken instead of\nstrengthening the heart, and to produce death (as sometimes happens), it\nwould determine itself, through determining the organism, to the\nfunction of \"kill\" instead of that of \"cure.\" The function and relation\nseem adventitious, depending on what kind of a heart the digitalis gets\nhold of, the digitalis and the heart being facts external and, so to\nspeak, accidental to each other. But this popular view, Mr. Haldane's\nfriends will continue, is an illusion. What seems to us the \"existence\"\nof digitalis and heart outside of the relations of killing or curing, is\nbut a function in a wider system of relations, of which, _pro hac vice_,\nwe take no account. The larger system determines the _existence_ just\nas absolutely as the system \"kill,\" or the system \"cure,\" determined the\n_function_ of the digitalis. Ascend to the absolute system, instead of\nbiding with these relative and partial ones, and you shall see that the\nlaw of through-and-throughness must and does obtain.\nOf course, this argument is entirely reasonable, and debars us\ncompletely from chopping logic about the concrete examples Mr. Haldane\nhas chosen. It is not his fault if his categories are so fine an\ninstrument that nothing but the sum total of things can be taken to show\nus the manner of their use. It is simply our misfortune that he has not\nthe sum total of things to show it by. Let us fall back from all\nconcrete attempts and see what we can do with his notion of\nthrough-and-throughness, avowedly taken _in abstracto_. In abstract\nsystems the \"through-and-through\" Ideal is realized on every hand. In\nany system, as such, the members are only _members_ in the system.\nAbolish the system and you abolish its members, for you have conceived\nthem through no other property than the abstract one of membership.\nNeither rightness nor leftness, except through bi-laterality. Neither\nmortgager nor mortgagee, except through mortgage. The logic of these\ncases is this:--_If_ A, then B; but _if_ B, then A: wherefore _if_\neither, Both; and if not Both, Nothing.\nIt costs nothing, not even a mental effort, to admit that the absolute\ntotality of things _may_ be organized exactly after the pattern of one\nof these \"through-and-through\" abstractions. In fact, it is the\npleasantest and freest of mental movements. Husband makes, and is made\nby, wife, through marriage; one makes other, by being itself other;\neverything self-created through its opposite--you go round like a\nsquirrel in a cage. But if you stop and reflect upon what you are about,\nyou lay bare the exact point at issue between common sense and the\n\"through-and-through\" school.\nWhat, in fact, is the logic of these abstract systems? It is, as we said\nabove: If any Member, then the Whole System; if not the Whole System,\nthen Nothing. But how can Logic possibly do anything more with these\ntwo hypotheses than combine them into the single disjunctive\nproposition--\"Either this Whole System, just as it stands, or Nothing at\nall.\" Is not that disjunction the ultimate word of Logic in the matter,\nand can any disjunction, as such, resolve _itself_? It may be that Mr.\nHaldane sees how one horn, the concept of the Whole System, carries real\nexistence with it. But if he has been as unsuccessful as I in\nassimilating the Hegelian re-editings of the Anselmian proof,[143] he\nwill have to say that though Logic may determine _what_ the system must\nbe, _if_ it is, something else than Logic must tell us _that_ it is. Mr.\nHaldane in this case would probably consciously, or unconsciously, make\nan appeal to Fact: the disjunction _is_ decided, since nobody can\ndispute that now, as a matter of fact, _something_, and not nothing,\n_is_. We must _therefore_, he would probably say, go on to admit the\nWhole System in the desiderated sense. Is not then the validity of the\nAnselmian proof the nucleus of the whole question between Logic and\nFact? Ought not the efforts of Mr. Haldane and his friends to be\nprincipally devoted to its elucidation? Is it not the real door of\nseparation between Empiricism and Rationalism? And if the Rationalists\nleave that door for a moment off its hinges, can any power keep that\nabstract, opaque, unmediated, external, irrational, and irresponsible\nmonster, known to the vulgar as bare Fact, from getting in and\ncontaminating the whole sanctuary with his presence? Can anything\nprevent Faust from changing \"Am Anfang war das Wort\" into \"Am Anfang war\ndie That?\"\nNothing in earth or heaven. Only the Anselmian proof can keep Fact out\nof philosophy. The question, \"Shall Fact be recognized as an ultimate\nprinciple?\" is the whole issue between the Rationalists and the\nEmpiricism of vulgar thought.\nOf course, if so recognized, Fact sets a limit to the\n\"through-and-through\" character of the world's rationality. That\nrationality might then mediate between all the members of our\nconception of the world, but not between the conception itself and\nreality. Reality would have to be given, not by Reason, but by Fact.\nFact holds out blankly, brutally and blindly, against that universal\ndeliquescence of everything into logical relations which the Absolutist\nLogic demands, and it is the only thing that does hold out. Hence the\nire of the Absolutist Logic--hence its non-recognition, its 'cutting' of\nFact.\nThe reasons it gives for the 'cutting' are that Fact is speechless, a\nmere word for the negation of thought, a vacuous unknowability, a\ndog-in-the-manger, in truth, which having no rights of its own, can find\nnothing else to do than to keep its betters out of theirs.\nThere are two points involved here: first the claim that certain things\nhave rights that are absolute, ubiquitous and all pervasive, and in\nregard to which nothing else can possibly exist in its _own_ right; and\nsecond that anything that denies _this_ assertion is _pure_ negativity\nwith no positive context whatsoever.\nTake the latter point first. Is it true that what is negative in one way\nis thereby convicted of incapacity to be positive in any other way? The\nword \"Fact\" is like the word \"Accident,\" like the word \"Absolute\"\nitself. They all have their negative connotation. In truth, their whole\nconnotation is negative and relative. All it says is that, whatever the\nthing may be that is denoted by the words, _other_ things do not control\nit. Where fact, where accident is, they must be silent, it alone can\nspeak. But that does not prevent its speaking as loudly as you please,\nin its own tongue. It may have an inward life, self-transparent and\nactive in the maximum degree. An indeterminate future volition on my\npart, for example, would be a strict accident as far as my present self\nis concerned. But that could not prevent it, _in the moment in which it\noccurred_, from being possibly the most intensely living and luminous\nexperience I ever had. Its quality of being a brute fact _ab extra_ says\nnothing whatever as to its inwardness. It simply says to _outsiders_:\n'Hands off!'\nAnd this brings us back to the first point of the Absolutist indictment\nof Fact. Is that point really anything more than a fantastic dislike to\nletting _anything_ say 'Hands off'? What else explains the contempt the\nAbsolutist authors exhibit for a freedom defined simply on its\n\"negative\" side, as freedom \"from,\" etc.? What else prompts them to\nderide such freedom? But, dislike for dislike, who shall decide? Why is\nnot their dislike at having me \"from\" them, entirely on a par with mine\nat having them \"through\" me?\nI know very well that in talking of dislikes to those who never mention\nthem, I am doing a very coarse thing, and making a sort of intellectual\nOrson of myself. But, for the life of me, I can not help it, because I\nfeel sure that likes and dislikes _must_ be among the ultimate factors\nof their philosophy as well as of mine. Would they but admit it! How\nsweetly we then could hold converse together! There is something finite\nabout us both, as we now stand. We do not know the Absolute Whole _yet_.\n_Part_ of it is still negative to us. Among the _whats_ of it still\nstalks a mob of opaque _thats_, without which we cannot think. But just\nas I admit that this is all possibly provisional, that even the\nAnselmian proof may come out all right, and creation _may_ be a rational\nsystem through-and-through, why might they not also admit that it may\nall be otherwise, and that the shadow, the opacity, the negativity, the\n\"from\"-ness, the plurality that is ultimate, _may_ never be wholly\ndriven from the scene. We should both then be avowedly making\nhypotheses, playing with Ideals. Ah! Why is the notion of hypothesis so\nabhorrent to the Hegelian mind?\nAnd once down on our common level of hypothesis, we might then admit\nscepticism, since the Whole is not yet revealed, to be the soundest\n_logical_ position. But since we are in the main not sceptics, we might\ngo on and frankly confess to each other the motives for our several\nfaiths. I frankly confess mine--I can not but think that at bottom they\nare of an \u00e6sthetic and not of a logical sort. The \"through-and-through\"\nuniverse seems to suffocate me with its infallible impeccable\nall-pervasiveness. Its necessity, with no possibilities; its relations,\nwith no subjects, make me feel as if I had entered into a contract with\nno reserved rights, or rather as if I had to live in a large seaside\nboarding-house with no private bed-room in which I might take refuge\nfrom the society of the place. I am distinctly aware, moreover, that the\nold quarrel of sinner and pharisee has something to do with the matter.\nCertainly, to my personal knowledge, all Hegelians are not prigs, but I\nsomehow feel as if all prigs ought to end, if developed, by becoming\nHegelians. There is a story of two clergymen asked by mistake to conduct\nthe same funeral. One came first and had got no farther than \"I am the\nResurrection and the Life,\" when the other entered. \"_I_ am the\nResurrection and the Life,\" cried the latter. The \"through-and-through\"\nphilosophy, as it actually exists, reminds many of us of that clergyman.\nIt seems too buttoned-up and white-chokered and clean-shaven a thing to\nspeak for the vast slow-breathing unconscious Kosmos with its dread\nabysses and its unknown tides. The \"freedom\" _we_ want to see there is\nnot the freedom, with a string tied to its leg and warranted not to fly\naway, of that philosophy. \"Let it fly away,\" we say, \"from _us_! What\nthen?\"\nAgain, I know I am exhibiting my mental grossness. But again, _Ich kann\nnicht anders._ I show my feelings; why _will_ they not show theirs? I\nknow they _have_ a personal feeling about the through-and-through\nuniverse, which is entirely different from mine, and which I should very\nlikely be much the better for gaining if they would only show me how.\nTheir persistence in telling me that feeling has nothing to do with the\nquestion, that it is a pure matter of absolute reason, keeps me for ever\nout of the pale. Still seeing a _that_ in things which Logic does not\nexpel, the most I can do is to _aspire_ to the expulsion. At present I\ndo not even aspire. Aspiration is a feeling. What can kindle feeling but\nthe example of feeling? And if the Hegelians _will_ refuse to set an\nexample, what can they expect the rest of us to do? To speak more\nseriously, the one _fundamental_ quarrel Empiricism has with Absolutism\nis over this repudiation by Absolutism of the personal and \u00e6sthetic\nfactor in the construction of philosophy. That we all of us have\nfeelings, Empiricism feels quite sure. That they may be as prophetic and\nanticipatory of truth as anything else we have, and some of them more so\nthan others, can not possibly be denied. But what hope is there of\nsquaring and settling opinions unless Absolutism will hold parley on\nthis common ground; and will admit that all philosophies are hypotheses,\nto which all our faculties, emotional as well as logical, help us, and\nthe truest of which will at the final integration of things be found in\npossession of the men whose faculties on the whole had the best divining\npower?\nFOOTNOTES:\n[140] [Reprinted from _Mind_, vol.

They are printed as delivered, without\ndevelopments or notes. The pragmatic movement, so-called--I do not like\nthe name, but apparently it is too late to change it--seems to have\nrather suddenly precipitated itself out of the air. A number of\ntendencies that have always existed in philosophy have all at once\nbecome conscious of themselves collectively, and of their combined\nmission; and this has occurred in so many countries, and from so many\ndifferent points of view, that much unconcerted statement has resulted.\nI have sought to unify the picture as it presents itself to my own eyes,\ndealing in broad strokes, and avoiding minute controversy. Much futile\ncontroversy might have been avoided, I believe, if our critics had been\nwilling to wait until we got our message fairly out.\nIf my lectures interest any reader in the general subject, he will\ndoubtless wish to read farther. I therefore give him a few references.\nIn America, John Dewey's 'Studies in Logical Theory' are the foundation.\nRead also by Dewey the articles in the Philosophical Review, vol.\nxv, pp. 113 and 465, in Mind, vol. xv, p. 293, and in the Journal of\nPhilosophy, vol. iv, p. 197.\nProbably the best statements to begin with however, are F. C. S.\nSchiller's in his 'Studies in Humanism,' especially the essays numbered\ni, v, vi, vii, xviii and xix. His previous essays and in general\nthe polemic literature of the subject are fully referred to in his\nfootnotes.\nFurthermore, see G. Milhaud: le Rationnel, 1898, and the fine articles\nby Le Roy in the Revue de Metaphysique, vols. 7, 8 and 9. Also articles\nby Blondel and de Sailly in the Annales de Philosophie Chretienne, 4me\nSerie, vols. 2 and 3. Papini announces a book on Pragmatism, in the\nFrench language, to be published very soon.\nTo avoid one misunderstanding at least, let me say that there is no\nlogical connexion between pragmatism, as I understand it, and a doctrine\nwhich I have recently set forth as 'radical empiricism.' The latter\nstands on its own feet. One may entirely reject it and still be a\npragmatist.\nHarvard University, April, 1907.\nContents\nLecture I\nThe Present Dilemma in Philosophy\nChesterton quoted. Everyone has a philosophy. Temperament is a factor in\nall philosophizing. Rationalists and empiricists. The tender-minded\nand the tough-minded. Most men wish both facts and religion. Empiricism\ngives facts without religion. Rationalism gives religion without facts.\nThe layman's dilemma. The unreality in rationalistic systems. Leibnitz\non the damned, as an example. M. I. Swift on the optimism of idealists.\nPragmatism as a mediating system. An objection. Reply: philosophies have\ncharacters like men, and are liable to as summary judgments. Spencer as\nan example.\nLecture II\nWhat Pragmatism Means\nThe squirrel. Pragmatism as a method. History of the method. Its\ncharacter and affinities. How it contrasts with rationalism and\nintellectualism. A 'corridor theory.' Pragmatism as a theory of truth,\nequivalent to 'humanism.' Earlier views of mathematical, logical, and\nnatural truth. More recent views. Schiller's and Dewey's 'instrumental'\nview. The formation of new beliefs. Older truth always has to be kept\naccount of. Older truth arose similarly. The 'humanistic' doctrine.\nRationalistic criticisms of it. Pragmatism as mediator between\nempiricism and religion. Barrenness of transcendental idealism. How far\nthe concept of the Absolute must be called true. The true is the good\nin the way of belief. The clash of truths. Pragmatism unstiffens\ndiscussion.\nLecture III\nSome Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered\nThe problem of substance. The Eucharist. Berkeley's pragmatic treatment\nof material substance. Locke's of personal identity. The problem of\nmaterialism. Rationalistic treatment of it. Pragmatic treatment. 'God'\nis no better than 'Matter' as a principle, unless he promise more.\nPragmatic comparison of the two principles. The problem of design.\n'Design' per se is barren. The question is WHAT design. The problem of\n'free-will.' Its relations to 'accountability.' Free-will a cosmological\ntheory. The pragmatic issue at stake in all these problems is what do\nthe alternatives PROMISE.\nLecture IV\nThe One and the Many\nTotal reflection. Philosophy seeks not only unity, but totality.\nRationalistic feeling about unity. Pragmatically considered, the world\nis one in many ways. One time and space. One subject of discourse. Its\nparts interact. Its oneness and manyness are co-ordinate. Question of\none origin. Generic oneness. One purpose. One story. One knower. Value\nof pragmatic method. Absolute monism. Vivekananda. Various types of\nunion discussed. Conclusion: We must oppose monistic dogmatism and\nfollow empirical findings.\nLecture V\nPragmatism and Common Sense\nNoetic pluralism. How our knowledge grows. Earlier ways of thinking\nremain. Prehistoric ancestors DISCOVERED the common sense concepts. List\nof them. They came gradually into use. Space and time. 'Things.' Kinds.\n'Cause' and 'law.' Common sense one stage in mental evolution, due\nto geniuses. The 'critical' stages: 1) scientific and 2) philosophic,\ncompared with common sense. Impossible to say which is the more 'true.'\nLecture VI\nPragmatism's Conception of Truth\nThe polemic situation. What does agreement with reality mean? It means\nverifiability. Verifiability means ability to guide us prosperously\nthrough experience. Completed verifications seldom needful. 'Eternal'\ntruths. Consistency, with language, with previous truths. Rationalist\nobjections. Truth is a good, like health, wealth, etc. It is expedient\nthinking. The past. Truth grows. Rationalist objections. Reply to them.\nLecture VII\nPragmatism and Humanism\nThe notion of THE Truth. Schiller on 'Humanism.' Three sorts of\nreality of which any new truth must take account. To 'take account' is\nambiguous. Absolutely independent reality is hard to find. The human\ncontribution is ubiquitous and builds out the given. Essence of\npragmatism's contrast with rationalism. Rationalism affirms a\ntransempirical world. Motives for this. Tough-mindedness rejects them. A\ngenuine alternative. Pragmatism mediates.\nLecture VIII\nPragmatism and Religion\nUtility of the Absolute. Whitman's poem 'To You.' Two ways of taking\nit. My friend's letter. Necessities versus possibilities. 'Possibility'\ndefined. Three views of the world's salvation. Pragmatism is\nmelioristic. We may create reality. Why should anything BE? Supposed\nchoice before creation. The healthy and the morbid reply. The 'tender'\nand the 'tough' types of religion. Pragmatism mediates.\nPRAGMATISM\nLecture I\nThe Present Dilemma in Philosophy\nIn the preface to that admirable collection of essays of his called\n'Heretics,' Mr. Chesterton writes these words: \"There are some\npeople--and I am one of them--who think that the most practical and\nimportant thing about a man is still his view of the universe. We think\nthat for a landlady considering a lodger, it is important to know his\nincome, but still more important to know his philosophy. We think that\nfor a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to know\nthe enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's\nphilosophy. We think the question is not whether the theory of the\ncosmos affects matters, but whether, in the long run, anything else\naffects them.\"\nI think with Mr. Chesterton in this matter. I know that you, ladies and\ngentlemen, have a philosophy, each and all of you, and that the most\ninteresting and important thing about you is the way in which it\ndetermines the perspective in your several worlds. You know the same\nof me. And yet I confess to a certain tremor at the audacity of the\nenterprise which I am about to begin. For the philosophy which is so\nimportant in each of us is not a technical matter; it is our more or\nless dumb sense of what life honestly and deeply means. It is only\npartly got from books; it is our individual way of just seeing and\nfeeling the total push and pressure of the cosmos. I have no right to\nassume that many of you are students of the cosmos in the class-room\nsense, yet here I stand desirous of interesting you in a philosophy\nwhich to no small extent has to be technically treated. I wish to fill\nyou with sympathy with a contemporaneous tendency in which I profoundly\nbelieve, and yet I have to talk like a professor to you who are not\nstudents. Whatever universe a professor believes in must at any rate be\na universe that lends itself to lengthy discourse. A universe definable\nin two sentences is something for which the professorial intellect has\nno use. No faith in anything of that cheap kind! I have heard friends\nand colleagues try to popularize philosophy in this very hall, but they\nsoon grew dry, and then technical, and the results were only partially\nencouraging. So my enterprise is a bold one. The founder of pragmatism\nhimself recently gave a course of lectures at the Lowell Institute with\nthat very word in its title-flashes of brilliant light relieved\nagainst Cimmerian darkness! None of us, I fancy, understood ALL that he\nsaid--yet here I stand, making a very similar venture.\nI risk it because the very lectures I speak of DREW--they brought good\naudiences. There is, it must be confessed, a curious fascination in\nhearing deep things talked about, even tho neither we nor the disputants\nunderstand them. We get the problematic thrill, we feel the presence of\nthe vastness. Let a controversy begin in a smoking-room anywhere, about\nfree-will or God's omniscience, or good and evil, and see how everyone\nin the place pricks up his ears. Philosophy's results concern us all\nmost vitally, and philosophy's queerest arguments tickle agreeably our\nsense of subtlety and ingenuity.\nBelieving in philosophy myself devoutly, and believing also that a kind\nof new dawn is breaking upon us philosophers, I feel impelled, per fas\naut nefas, to try to impart to you some news of the situation.\nPhilosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human\npursuits. It works in the minutest crannies and it opens out the widest\nvistas. It 'bakes no bread,' as has been said, but it can inspire our\nsouls with courage; and repugnant as its manners, its doubting and\nchallenging, its quibbling and dialectics, often are to common people,\nno one of us can get along without the far-flashing beams of light it\nsends over the world's perspectives. These illuminations at least, and\nthe contrast-effects of darkness and mystery that accompany them, give\nto what it says an interest that is much more than professional.\nThe history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash\nof human temperaments. Undignified as such a treatment may seem to some\nof my colleagues, I shall have to take account of this clash and explain\na good many of the divergencies of philosophers by it. Of whatever\ntemperament a professional philosopher is, he tries when philosophizing\nto sink the fact of his temperament. Temperament is no conventionally\nrecognized reason, so he urges impersonal reasons only for his\nconclusions. Yet his temperament really gives him a stronger bias than\nany of his more strictly objective premises. It loads the evidence\nfor him one way or the other, making for a more sentimental or a more\nhard-hearted view of the universe, just as this fact or that principle\nwould. He trusts his temperament. Wanting a universe that suits it, he\nbelieves in any representation of the universe that does suit it.\nHe feels men of opposite temper to be out of key with the world's\ncharacter, and in his heart considers them incompetent and 'not in\nit,' in the philosophic business, even tho they may far excel him in\ndialectical ability.\nYet in the forum he can make no claim, on the bare ground of his\ntemperament, to superior discernment or authority. There arises thus a\ncertain insincerity in our philosophic discussions: the potentest of\nall our premises is never mentioned. I am sure it would contribute to\nclearness if in these lectures we should break this rule and mention it,\nand I accordingly feel free to do so.\nOf course I am talking here of very positively marked men, men\nof radical idiosyncracy, who have set their stamp and likeness on\nphilosophy and figure in its history. Plato, Locke, Hegel, Spencer,\nare such temperamental thinkers. Most of us have, of course, no\nvery definite intellectual temperament, we are a mixture of opposite\ningredients, each one present very moderately. We hardly know our own\npreferences in abstract matters; some of us are easily talked out of\nthem, and end by following the fashion or taking up with the beliefs of\nthe most impressive philosopher in our neighborhood, whoever he may be.\nBut the one thing that has COUNTED so far in philosophy is that a man\nshould see things, see them straight in his own peculiar way, and be\ndissatisfied with any opposite way of seeing them. There is no reason\nto suppose that this strong temperamental vision is from now onward to\ncount no longer in the history of man's beliefs.\nNow the particular difference of temperament that I have in mind\nin making these remarks is one that has counted in literature, art,\ngovernment and manners as well as in philosophy. In manners we find\nformalists and free-and-easy persons. In government, authoritarians and\nanarchists. In literature, purists or academicals, and realists. In art,\nclassics and romantics. You recognize these contrasts as familiar; well,\nin philosophy we have a very similar contrast expressed in the pair of\nterms 'rationalist' and 'empiricist,' 'empiricist' meaning your lover of\nfacts in all their crude variety, 'rationalist' meaning your devotee to\nabstract and eternal principles. No one can live an hour without both\nfacts and principles, so it is a difference rather of emphasis; yet it\nbreeds antipathies of the most pungent character between those who\nlay the emphasis differently; and we shall find it extraordinarily\nconvenient to express a certain contrast in men's ways of taking their\nuniverse, by talking of the 'empiricist' and of the 'rationalist'\ntemper. These terms make the contrast simple and massive.\nMore simple and massive than are usually the men of whom the terms are\npredicated. For every sort of permutation and combination is possible in\nhuman nature; and if I now proceed to define more fully what I have in\nmind when I speak of rationalists and empiricists, by adding to each\nof those titles some secondary qualifying characteristics, I beg you to\nregard my conduct as to a certain extent arbitrary. I select types\nof combination that nature offers very frequently, but by no means\nuniformly, and I select them solely for their convenience in helping\nme to my ulterior purpose of characterizing pragmatism. Historically we\nfind the terms 'intellectualism' and 'sensationalism' used as synonyms\nof 'rationalism' and 'empiricism.' Well, nature seems to combine most\nfrequently with intellectualism an idealistic and optimistic tendency.\nEmpiricists on the other hand are not uncommonly materialistic, and\ntheir optimism is apt to be decidedly conditional and tremulous.\nRationalism is always monistic. It starts from wholes and universals,\nand makes much of the unity of things. Empiricism starts from the parts,\nand makes of the whole a collection-is not averse therefore to calling\nitself pluralistic. Rationalism usually considers itself more religious\nthan empiricism, but there is much to say about this claim, so I merely\nmention it. It is a true claim when the individual rationalist is what\nis called a man of feeling, and when the individual empiricist prides\nhimself on being hard-headed. In that case the rationalist will usually\nalso be in favor of what is called free-will, and the empiricist will\nbe a fatalist--I use the terms most popularly current. The rationalist\nfinally will be of dogmatic temper in his affirmations, while the\nempiricist may be more sceptical and open to discussion.\nI will write these traits down in two columns. I think you will\npractically recognize the two types of mental make-up that I mean if\nI head the columns by the titles 'tender-minded' and 'tough-minded'\nrespectively.\nTHE TENDER-MINDED\nRationalistic (going by 'principles'), Intellectualistic, Idealistic,\nOptimistic, Religious, Free-willist, Monistic, Dogmatical.\nTHE TOUGH-MINDED\nEmpiricist (going by 'facts'), Sensationalistic, Materialistic,\nPessimistic, Irreligious, Fatalistic, Pluralistic, Sceptical.\nPray postpone for a moment the question whether the two contrasted\nmixtures which I have written down are each inwardly coherent and\nself-consistent or not--I shall very soon have a good deal to say on\nthat point. It suffices for our immediate purpose that tender-minded and\ntough-minded people, characterized as I have written them down, do both\nexist. Each of you probably knows some well-marked example of each type,\nand you know what each example thinks of the example on the other side\nof the line. They have a low opinion of each other. Their antagonism,\nwhenever as individuals their temperaments have been intense, has formed\nin all ages a part of the philosophic atmosphere of the time. It forms a\npart of the philosophic atmosphere to-day. The tough think of the tender\nas sentimentalists and soft-heads. The tender feel the tough to be\nunrefined, callous, or brutal. Their mutual reaction is very much like\nthat that takes place when Bostonian tourists mingle with a population\nlike that of Cripple Creek. Each type believes the other to be inferior\nto itself; but disdain in the one case is mingled with amusement, in the\nother it has a dash of fear.\nNow, as I have already insisted, few of us are tender-foot Bostonians\npure and simple, and few are typical Rocky Mountain toughs, in\nphilosophy. Most of us have a hankering for the good things on both\nsides of the line. Facts are good, of course--give us lots of facts.\nPrinciples are good--give us plenty of principles. The world is\nindubitably one if you look at it in one way, but as indubitably is\nit many, if you look at it in another. It is both one and many--let us\nadopt a sort of pluralistic monism. Everything of course is necessarily\ndetermined, and yet of course our wills are free: a sort of free-will\ndeterminism is the true philosophy. The evil of the parts is undeniable;\nbut the whole can't be evil: so practical pessimism may be combined with\nmetaphysical optimism. And so forth--your ordinary philosophic layman\nnever being a radical, never straightening out his system, but living\nvaguely in one plausible compartment of it or another to suit the\ntemptations of successive hours.\nBut some of us are more than mere laymen in philosophy. We are worthy\nof the name of amateur athletes, and are vexed by too much inconsistency\nand vacillation in our creed. We cannot preserve a good intellectual\nconscience so long as we keep mixing incompatibles from opposite sides\nof the line.\nAnd now I come to the first positively important point which I wish to\nmake. Never were as many men of a decidedly empiricist proclivity in\nexistence as there are at the present day. Our children, one may say,\nare almost born scientific. But our esteem for facts has not neutralized\nin us all religiousness. It is itself almost religious. Our scientific\ntemper is devout. Now take a man of this type, and let him be also a\nphilosophic amateur, unwilling to mix a hodge-podge system after the\nfashion of a common layman, and what does he find his situation to be,\nin this blessed year of our Lord 1906? He wants facts; he wants\nscience; but he also wants a religion. And being an amateur and not an\nindependent originator in philosophy he naturally looks for guidance to\nthe experts and professionals whom he finds already in the field. A\nvery large number of you here present, possibly a majority of you, are\namateurs of just this sort.\nNow what kinds of philosophy do you find actually offered to meet your\nneed? You find an empirical philosophy that is not religious enough, and\na religious philosophy that is not empirical enough for your purpose.\nIf you look to the quarter where facts are most considered you find\nthe whole tough-minded program in operation, and the 'conflict between\nscience and religion' in full blast. Either it is that Rocky Mountain\ntough of a Haeckel with his materialistic monism, his ether-god and his\njest at your God as a 'gaseous vertebrate'; or it is Spencer treating\nthe world's history as a redistribution of matter and motion solely, and\nbowing religion politely out at the front door:--she may indeed continue\nto exist, but she must never show her face inside the temple. For a\nhundred and fifty years past the progress of science has seemed to mean\nthe enlargement of the material universe and the diminution of man's\nimportance. The result is what one may call the growth of naturalistic\nor positivistic feeling. Man is no law-giver to nature, he is an\nabsorber. She it is who stands firm; he it is who must accommodate\nhimself. Let him record truth, inhuman tho it be, and submit to it! The\nromantic spontaneity and courage are gone, the vision is materialistic\nand depressing. Ideals appear as inert by-products of physiology; what\nis higher is explained by what is lower and treated forever as a case of\n'nothing but'--nothing but something else of a quite inferior sort. You\nget, in short, a materialistic universe, in which only the tough-minded\nfind themselves congenially at home.\nIf now, on the other hand, you turn to the religious quarter for\nconsolation, and take counsel of the tender-minded philosophies, what do\nyou find?\nReligious philosophy in our day and generation is, among us\nEnglish-reading people, of two main types. One of these is more radical\nand aggressive, the other has more the air of fighting a slow retreat.\nBy the more radical wing of religious philosophy I mean the so-called\ntranscendental idealism of the Anglo-Hegelian school, the philosophy of\nsuch men as Green, the Cairds, Bosanquet, and Royce. This philosophy has\ngreatly influenced the more studious members of our protestant ministry.\nIt is pantheistic, and undoubtedly it has already blunted the edge of\nthe traditional theism in protestantism at large.\nThat theism remains, however. It is the lineal descendant, through one\nstage of concession after another, of the dogmatic scholastic theism\nstill taught rigorously in the seminaries of the catholic church. For a\nlong time it used to be called among us the philosophy of the Scottish\nschool. It is what I meant by the philosophy that has the air of\nfighting a slow retreat. Between the encroachments of the hegelians and\nother philosophers of the 'Absolute,' on the one hand, and those of the\nscientific evolutionists and agnostics, on the other, the men that\ngive us this kind of a philosophy, James Martineau, Professor Bowne,\nProfessor Ladd and others, must feel themselves rather tightly squeezed.\nFair-minded and candid as you like, this philosophy is not radical\nin temper. It is eclectic, a thing of compromises, that seeks a modus\nvivendi above all things. It accepts the facts of darwinism, the facts\nof cerebral physiology, but it does nothing active or enthusiastic with\nthem. It lacks the victorious and aggressive note. It lacks prestige in\nconsequence; whereas absolutism has a certain prestige due to the more\nradical style of it.\nThese two systems are what you have to choose between if you turn to the\ntender-minded school. And if you are the lovers of facts I have\nsupposed you to be, you find the trail of the serpent of rationalism, of\nintellectualism, over everything that lies on that side of the line. You\nescape indeed the materialism that goes with the reigning empiricism;\nbut you pay for your escape by losing contact with the concrete parts\nof life. The more absolutistic philosophers dwell on so high a level\nof abstraction that they never even try to come down. The absolute mind\nwhich they offer us, the mind that makes our universe by thinking it,\nmight, for aught they show us to the contrary, have made any one of a\nmillion other universes just as well as this. You can deduce no single\nactual particular from the notion of it. It is compatible with any state\nof things whatever being true here below. And the theistic God is almost\nas sterile a principle. You have to go to the world which he has created\nto get any inkling of his actual character: he is the kind of god that\nhas once for all made that kind of a world. The God of the theistic\nwriters lives on as purely abstract heights as does the Absolute.\nAbsolutism has a certain sweep and dash about it, while the usual theism\nis more insipid, but both are equally remote and vacuous. What you want\nis a philosophy that will not only exercise your powers of intellectual\nabstraction, but that will make some positive connexion with this actual\nworld of finite human lives.\nYou want a system that will combine both things, the scientific\nloyalty to facts and willingness to take account of them, the spirit of\nadaptation and accommodation, in short, but also the old confidence in\nhuman values and the resultant spontaneity, whether of the religious or\nof the romantic type. And this is then your dilemma: you find the two\nparts of your quaesitum hopelessly separated. You find empiricism with\ninhumanism and irreligion; or else you find a rationalistic philosophy\nthat indeed may call itself religious, but that keeps out of all\ndefinite touch with concrete facts and joys and sorrows.\nI am not sure how many of you live close enough to philosophy to realize\nfully what I mean by this last reproach, so I will dwell a little longer\non that unreality in all rationalistic systems by which your serious\nbeliever in facts is so apt to feel repelled.\nI wish that I had saved the first couple of pages of a thesis which\na student handed me a year or two ago. They illustrated my point so\nclearly that I am sorry I cannot read them to you now. This young man,\nwho was a graduate of some Western college, began by saying that he had\nalways taken for granted that when you entered a philosophic class-room\nyou had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one\nyou left behind you in the street. The two were supposed, he said, to\nhave so little to do with each other, that you could not possibly occupy\nyour mind with them at the same time. The world of concrete personal\nexperiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond\nimagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which\nyour philosophy-professor introduces you is simple, clean and noble.\nThe contradictions of real life are absent from it. Its architecture is\nclassic. Principles of reason trace its outlines, logical necessities\ncement its parts. Purity and dignity are what it most expresses. It is a\nkind of marble temple shining on a hill.\nIn point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than\na clear addition built upon it, a classic sanctuary in which the\nrationalist fancy may take refuge from the intolerably confused and\ngothic character which mere facts present. It is no EXPLANATION of our\nconcrete universe, it is another thing altogether, a substitute for it,\na remedy, a way of escape.\nIts temperament, if I may use the word temperament here, is utterly\nalien to the temperament of existence in the concrete. REFINEMENT is\nwhat characterizes our intellectualist philosophies. They exquisitely\nsatisfy that craving for a refined object of contemplation which is so\npowerful an appetite of the mind. But I ask you in all seriousness to\nlook abroad on this colossal universe of concrete facts, on their awful\nbewilderments, their surprises and cruelties, on the wildness which\nthey show, and then to tell me whether 'refined' is the one inevitable\ndescriptive adjective that springs to your lips.\nRefinement has its place in things, true enough. But a philosophy that\nbreathes out nothing but refinement will never satisfy the empiricist\ntemper of mind. It will seem rather a monument of artificiality. So we\nfind men of science preferring to turn their backs on metaphysics as on\nsomething altogether cloistered and spectral, and practical men shaking\nphilosophy's dust off their feet and following the call of the wild.\nTruly there is something a little ghastly in the satisfaction with which\na pure but unreal system will fill a rationalist mind. Leibnitz was\na rationalist mind, with infinitely more interest in facts than\nmost rationalist minds can show. Yet if you wish for superficiality\nincarnate, you have only to read that charmingly written 'Theodicee' of\nhis, in which he sought to justify the ways of God to man, and to prove\nthat the world we live in is the best of possible worlds. Let me quote a\nspecimen of what I mean.\nAmong other obstacles to his optimistic philosophy, it falls to Leibnitz\nto consider the number of the eternally damned. That it is infinitely\ngreater, in our human case, than that of those saved he assumes as a\npremise from the theologians, and then proceeds to argue in this way.\nEven then, he says:\n\"The evil will appear as almost nothing in comparison with the good, if\nwe once consider the real magnitude of the City of God. Coelius Secundus\nCurio has written a little book, 'De Amplitudine Regni Coelestis,' which\nwas reprinted not long ago. But he failed to compass the extent of the\nkingdom of the heavens. The ancients had small ideas of the works of\nGod. ... It seemed to them that only our earth had inhabitants, and even\nthe notion of our antipodes gave them pause. The rest of the world for\nthem consisted of some shining globes and a few crystalline spheres.\nBut to-day, whatever be the limits that we may grant or refuse to the\nUniverse we must recognize in it a countless number of globes, as big\nas ours or bigger, which have just as much right as it has to support\nrational inhabitants, tho it does not follow that these need all be men.\nOur earth is only one among the six principal satellites of our sun. As\nall the fixed stars are suns, one sees how small a place among visible\nthings our earth takes up, since it is only a satellite of one among\nthem. Now all these suns MAY be inhabited by none but happy creatures;\nand nothing obliges us to believe that the number of damned persons is\nvery great; for a VERY FEW INSTANCES AND SAMPLES SUFFICE FOR THE UTILITY\nWHICH GOOD DRAWS FROM EVIL. Moreover, since there is no reason to\nsuppose that there are stars everywhere, may there not be a great space\nbeyond the region of the stars? And this immense space, surrounding all\nthis region, ... may be replete with happiness and glory. ... What now\nbecomes of the consideration of our Earth and of its denizens? Does it\nnot dwindle to something incomparably less than a physical point, since\nour Earth is but a point compared with the distance of the fixed stars.\nThus the part of the Universe which we know, being almost lost in\nnothingness compared with that which is unknown to us, but which we\nare yet obliged to admit; and all the evils that we know lying in this\nalmost-nothing; it follows that the evils may be almost-nothing in\ncomparison with the goods that the Universe contains.\"\nLeibnitz continues elsewhere: \"There is a kind of justice which aims\nneither at the amendment of the criminal, nor at furnishing an example\nto others, nor at the reparation of the injury. This justice is founded\nin pure fitness, which finds a certain satisfaction in the expiation\nof a wicked deed. The Socinians and Hobbes objected to this punitive\njustice, which is properly vindictive justice and which God has reserved\nfor himself at many junctures. ... It is always founded in the fitness\nof things, and satisfies not only the offended party, but all wise\nlookers-on, even as beautiful music or a fine piece of architecture\nsatisfies a well-constituted mind. It is thus that the torments of the\ndamned continue, even tho they serve no longer to turn anyone away from\nsin, and that the rewards of the blest continue, even tho they confirm\nno one in good ways. The damned draw to themselves ever new penalties\nby their continuing sins, and the blest attract ever fresh joys by their\nunceasing progress in good. Both facts are founded on the principle of\nfitness, ... for God has made all things harmonious in perfection as I\nhave already said.\"\nLeibnitz's feeble grasp of reality is too obvious to need comment from\nme. It is evident that no realistic image of the experience of a damned\nsoul had ever approached the portals of his mind. Nor had it occurred to\nhim that the smaller is the number of 'samples' of the genus 'lost-soul'\nwhom God throws as a sop to the eternal fitness, the more unequitably\ngrounded is the glory of the blest. What he gives us is a cold literary\nexercise, whose cheerful substance even hell-fire does not warm.\nAnd do not tell me that to show the shallowness of rationalist\nphilosophizing I have had to go back to a shallow wigpated age. The\noptimism of present-day rationalism sounds just as shallow to the\nfact-loving mind. The actual universe is a thing wide open, but\nrationalism makes systems, and systems must be closed. For men in\npractical life perfection is something far off and still in process of\nachievement. This for rationalism is but the illusion of the finite\nand relative: the absolute ground of things is a perfection eternally\ncomplete.\nI find a fine example of revolt against the airy and shallow optimism\nof current religious philosophy in a publication of that valiant\nanarchistic writer Morrison I. Swift. Mr. Swift's anarchism goes a\nlittle farther than mine does, but I confess that I sympathize a\ngood deal, and some of you, I know, will sympathize heartily with his\ndissatisfaction with the idealistic optimisms now in vogue. He begins\nhis pamphlet on 'Human Submission' with a series of city reporter's\nitems from newspapers (suicides, deaths from starvation and the like) as\nspecimens of our civilized regime. For instance:\n\"'After trudging through the snow from one end of the city to the other\nin the vain hope of securing employment, and with his wife and six\nchildren without food and ordered to leave their home in an upper east\nside tenement house because of non-payment of rent, John Corcoran, a\nclerk, to-day ended his life by drinking carbolic acid. Corcoran lost\nhis position three weeks ago through illness, and during the period of\nidleness his scanty savings disappeared. Yesterday he obtained work with\na gang of city snow shovelers, but he was too weak from illness and was\nforced to quit after an hour's trial with the shovel. Then the\nweary task of looking for employment was again resumed. Thoroughly\ndiscouraged, Corcoran returned to his home late last night to find his\nwife and children without food and the notice of dispossession on the\ndoor.' On the following morning he drank the poison.\n\"The records of many more such cases lie before me [Mr. Swift goes on];\nan encyclopedia might easily be filled with their kind. These few I cite\nas an interpretation of the universe. 'We are aware of the presence of\nGod in His world,' says a writer in a recent English Review. [The very\npresence of ill in the temporal order is the condition of the perfection\nof the eternal order, writes Professor Royce ('The World and the\nIndividual,' II, 385).] 'The Absolute is the richer for every discord,\nand for all diversity which it embraces,' says F. H. Bradley (Appearance\nand Reality, 204). He means that these slain men make the universe\nricher, and that is Philosophy. But while Professors Royce and Bradley\nand a whole host of guileless thoroughfed thinkers are unveiling\nReality and the Absolute and explaining away evil and pain, this is the\ncondition of the only beings known to us anywhere in the universe with\na developed consciousness of what the universe is. What these people\nexperience IS Reality. It gives us an absolute phase of the universe. It\nis the personal experience of those most qualified in all our circle\nof knowledge to HAVE experience, to tell us WHAT is. Now, what does\nTHINKING ABOUT the experience of these persons come to compared with\ndirectly, personally feeling it, as they feel it? The philosophers are\ndealing in shades, while those who live and feel know truth. And the\nmind of mankind-not yet the mind of philosophers and of the proprietary\nclass-but of the great mass of the silently thinking and feeling men,\nis coming to this view. They are judging the universe as they have\nheretofore permitted the hierophants of religion and learning to judge\nTHEM. ...\n\"This Cleveland workingman, killing his children and himself [another\nof the cited cases], is one of the elemental, stupendous facts of this\nmodern world and of this universe. It cannot be glozed over or minimized\naway by all the treatises on God, and Love, and Being, helplessly\nexisting in their haughty monumental vacuity. This is one of the simple\nirreducible elements of this world's life after millions of years of\ndivine opportunity and twenty centuries of Christ. It is in the moral\nworld like atoms or sub-atoms in the physical, primary, indestructible.\nAnd what it blazons to man is the ... imposture of all philosophy\nwhich does not see in such events the consummate factor of conscious\nexperience. These facts invincibly prove religion a nullity. Man will\nnot give religion two thousand centuries or twenty centuries more to try\nitself and waste human time; its time is up, its probation is ended.\nIts own record ends it. Mankind has not sons and eternities to spare for\ntrying out discredited systems....\" [Footnote: Morrison I. Swift, Human\nSubmission, Part Second, Philadelphia, Liberty Press, 1905, pp. 4-10.]\nSuch is the reaction of an empiricist mind upon the rationalist bill of\nfare. It is an absolute 'No, I thank you.' \"Religion,\" says Mr. Swift,\n\"is like a sleep-walker to whom actual things are blank.\" And such,\ntho possibly less tensely charged with feeling, is the verdict of\nevery seriously inquiring amateur in philosophy to-day who turns to the\nphilosophy-professors for the wherewithal to satisfy the fulness of his\nnature's needs. Empiricist writers give him a materialism, rationalists\ngive him something religious, but to that religion \"actual things are\nblank.\" He becomes thus the judge of us philosophers. Tender or tough,\nhe finds us wanting. None of us may treat his verdicts disdainfully, for\nafter all, his is the typically perfect mind, the mind the sum of whose\ndemands is greatest, the mind whose criticisms and dissatisfactions are\nfatal in the long run.\nIt is at this point that my own solution begins to appear. I offer the\noddly-named thing pragmatism as a philosophy that can satisfy both kinds\nof demand. It can remain religious like the rationalisms, but at the\nsame time, like the empiricisms, it can preserve the richest intimacy\nwith facts. I hope I may be able to leave many of you with as favorable\nan opinion of it as I preserve myself. Yet, as I am near the end of my\nhour, I will not introduce pragmatism bodily now. I will begin with it\non the stroke of the clock next time. I prefer at the present moment to\nreturn a little on what I have said.\nIf any of you here are professional philosophers, and some of you I know\nto be such, you will doubtless have felt my discourse so far to have\nbeen crude in an unpardonable, nay, in an almost incredible degree.\nTender-minded and tough-minded, what a barbaric disjunction! And, in\ngeneral, when philosophy is all compacted of delicate intellectualities\nand subtleties and scrupulosities, and when every possible sort of\ncombination and transition obtains within its bounds, what a brutal\ncaricature and reduction of highest things to the lowest possible\nexpression is it to represent its field of conflict as a sort of\nrough-and-tumble fight between two hostile temperaments! What a\nchildishly external view! And again, how stupid it is to treat the\nabstractness of rationalist systems as a crime, and to damn them because\nthey offer themselves as sanctuaries and places of escape, rather than\nas prolongations of the world of facts. Are not all our theories just\nremedies and places of escape? And, if philosophy is to be religious,\nhow can she be anything else than a place of escape from the crassness\nof reality's surface? What better thing can she do than raise us out of\nour animal senses and show us another and a nobler home for our minds in\nthat great framework of ideal principles subtending all reality, which\nthe intellect divines? How can principles and general views ever be\nanything but abstract outlines? Was Cologne cathedral built without an\narchitect's plan on paper? Is refinement in itself an abomination? Is\nconcrete rudeness the only thing that's true?\nBelieve me, I feel the full force of the indictment. The picture I\nhave given is indeed monstrously over-simplified and rude. But like all\nabstractions, it will prove to have its use. If philosophers can treat\nthe life of the universe abstractly, they must not complain of an\nabstract treatment of the life of philosophy itself. In point of fact\nthe picture I have given is, however coarse and sketchy, literally true.\nTemperaments with their cravings and refusals do determine men in their\nphilosophies, and always will. The details of systems may be reasoned\nout piecemeal, and when the student is working at a system, he may\noften forget the forest for the single tree. But when the labor is\naccomplished, the mind always performs its big summarizing act, and the\nsystem forthwith stands over against one like a living thing, with that\nstrange simple note of individuality which haunts our memory, like the\nwraith of the man, when a friend or enemy of ours is dead.\nNot only Walt Whitman could write \"who touches this book touches a man.\"\nThe books of all the great philosophers are like so many men. Our\nsense of an essential personal flavor in each one of them, typical but\nindescribable, is the finest fruit of our own accomplished philosophic\neducation. What the system pretends to be is a picture of the great\nuniverse of God. What it is--and oh so flagrantly!--is the revelation of\nhow intensely odd the personal flavor of some fellow creature is. Once\nreduced to these terms (and all our philosophies get reduced to them in\nminds made critical by learning) our commerce with the systems reverts\nto the informal, to the instinctive human reaction of satisfaction or\ndislike. We grow as peremptory in our rejection or admission, as when a\nperson presents himself as a candidate for our favor; our verdicts are\ncouched in as simple adjectives of praise or dispraise. We measure the\ntotal character of the universe as we feel it, against the flavor of the\nphilosophy proffered us, and one word is enough.\n\"Statt der lebendigen Natur,\" we say, \"da Gott die Menschen schuf\nhinein\"--that nebulous concoction, that wooden, that straight-laced\nthing, that crabbed artificiality, that musty schoolroom product, that\nsick man's dream! Away with it. Away with all of them! Impossible!\nImpossible!\nOur work over the details of his system is indeed what gives us our\nresultant impression of the philosopher, but it is on the resultant\nimpression itself that we react. Expertness in philosophy is measured\nby the definiteness of our summarizing reactions, by the immediate\nperceptive epithet with which the expert hits such complex objects\noff. But great expertness is not necessary for the epithet to come. Few\npeople have definitely articulated philosophies of their own. But almost\neveryone has his own peculiar sense of a certain total character in\nthe universe, and of the inadequacy fully to match it of the peculiar\nsystems that he knows. They don't just cover HIS world. One will be too\ndapper, another too pedantic, a third too much of a job-lot of opinions,\na fourth too morbid, and a fifth too artificial, or what not. At any\nrate he and we know offhand that such philosophies are out of plumb and\nout of key and out of 'whack,' and have no business to speak up in the\nuniverse's name. Plato, Locke, Spinoza, Mill, Caird, Hegel--I prudently\navoid names nearer home!--I am sure that to many of you, my hearers,\nthese names are little more than reminders of as many curious personal\nways of falling short. It would be an obvious absurdity if such ways of\ntaking the universe were actually true. We philosophers have to reckon\nwith such feelings on your part. In the last resort, I repeat, it will\nbe by them that all our philosophies shall ultimately be judged. The\nfinally victorious way of looking at things will be the most completely\nIMPRESSIVE way to the normal run of minds.\nOne word more--namely about philosophies necessarily being abstract\noutlines. There are outlines and outlines, outlines of buildings\nthat are FAT, conceived in the cube by their planner, and outlines of\nbuildings invented flat on paper, with the aid of ruler and compass.\nThese remain skinny and emaciated even when set up in stone and mortar,\nand the outline already suggests that result. An outline in itself is\nmeagre, truly, but it does not necessarily suggest a meagre thing. It is\nthe essential meagreness of WHAT IS SUGGESTED by the usual rationalistic\nphilosophies that moves empiricists to their gesture of rejection. The\ncase of Herbert Spencer's system is much to the point here. Rationalists\nfeel his fearful array of insufficiencies. His dry schoolmaster\ntemperament, the hurdy-gurdy monotony of him, his preference for\ncheap makeshifts in argument, his lack of education even in mechanical\nprinciples, and in general the vagueness of all his fundamental ideas,\nhis whole system wooden, as if knocked together out of cracked hemlock\nboards--and yet the half of England wants to bury him in Westminster\nAbbey.\nWhy? Why does Spencer call out so much reverence in spite of his\nweakness in rationalistic eyes? Why should so many educated men who\nfeel that weakness, you and I perhaps, wish to see him in the Abbey\nnotwithstanding?\nSimply because we feel his heart to be IN THE RIGHT PLACE\nphilosophically. His principles may be all skin and bone, but at any\nrate his books try to mould themselves upon the particular shape of\nthis, particular world's carcase. The noise of facts resounds through\nall his chapters, the citations of fact never cease, he emphasizes\nfacts, turns his face towards their quarter; and that is enough. It\nmeans the right kind of thing for the empiricist mind.\nThe pragmatistic philosophy of which I hope to begin talking in my\nnext lecture preserves as cordial a relation with facts, and, unlike\nSpencer's philosophy, it neither begins nor ends by turning positive\nreligious constructions out of doors--it treats them cordially as well.\nI hope I may lead you to find it just the mediating way of thinking that\nyou require.\nLecture II\nWhat Pragmatism Means\nSome years ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I\nreturned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a ferocious\nmetaphysical dispute. The corpus of the dispute was a squirrel--a live\nsquirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over\nagainst the tree's opposite side a human being was imagined to stand.\nThis human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly\nround the tree, but no matter how fast he goes, the squirrel moves\nas fast in the opposite direction, and always keeps the tree between\nhimself and the man, so that never a glimpse of him is caught. The\nresultant metaphysical problem now is this: DOES THE MAN GO ROUND THE\nSQUIRREL OR NOT? He goes round the tree, sure enough, and the squirrel\nis on the tree; but does he go round the squirrel? In the unlimited\nleisure of the wilderness, discussion had been worn threadbare. Everyone\nhad taken sides, and was obstinate; and the numbers on both sides were\neven. Each side, when I appeared, therefore appealed to me to make it\na majority. Mindful of the scholastic adage that whenever you meet a\ncontradiction you must make a distinction, I immediately sought and\nfound one, as follows: \"Which party is right,\" I said, \"depends on what\nyou PRACTICALLY MEAN by 'going round' the squirrel. If you mean passing\nfrom the north of him to the east, then to the south, then to the west,\nand then to the north of him again, obviously the man does go round him,\nfor he occupies these successive positions. But if on the contrary you\nmean being first in front of him, then on the right of him, then behind\nhim, then on his left, and finally in front again, it is quite as\nobvious that the man fails to go round him, for by the compensating\nmovements the squirrel makes, he keeps his belly turned towards the man\nall the time, and his back turned away. Make the distinction, and there\nis no occasion for any farther dispute. You are both right and both\nwrong according as you conceive the verb 'to go round' in one practical\nfashion or the other.\"\nAltho one or two of the hotter disputants called my speech a shuffling\nevasion, saying they wanted no quibbling or scholastic hair-splitting,\nbut meant just plain honest English 'round,' the majority seemed to\nthink that the distinction had assuaged the dispute.\nI tell this trivial anecdote because it is a peculiarly simple example\nof what I wish now to speak of as THE PRAGMATIC METHOD. The pragmatic\nmethod is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that\notherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or many?--fated or\nfree?--material or spiritual?--here are notions either of which may\nor may not hold good of the world; and disputes over such notions are\nunending. The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each\nnotion by tracing its respective practical consequences. What difference\nwould it practically make to anyone if this notion rather than that\nnotion were true? If no practical difference whatever can be traced,\nthen the alternatives mean practically the same thing, and all dispute\nis idle. Whenever a dispute is serious, we ought to be able to show some\npractical difference that must follow from one side or the other's being\nright.\nA glance at the history of the idea will show you still better what\npragmatism means. The term is derived from the same Greek word [pi rho\nalpha gamma mu alpha], meaning action, from which our words 'practice'\nand 'practical' come. It was first introduced into philosophy by Mr.\nCharles Peirce in 1878. In an article entitled 'How to Make Our Ideas\nClear,' in the 'Popular Science Monthly' for January of that year\n[Footnote: Translated in the Revue Philosophique for January, 1879 (vol.\nvii).] Mr. Peirce, after pointing out that our beliefs are really rules\nfor action, said that to develope a thought's meaning, we need only\ndetermine what conduct it is fitted to produce: that conduct is for\nus its sole significance. And the tangible fact at the root of all our\nthought-distinctions, however subtle, is that there is no one of them so\nfine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice.\nTo attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need\nonly consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind the object\nmay involve--what sensations we are to expect from it, and what\nreactions we must prepare. Our conception of these effects, whether\nimmediate or remote, is then for us the whole of our conception of the\nobject, so far as that conception has positive significance at all.\nThis is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. It lay\nentirely unnoticed by anyone for twenty years, until I, in an address\nbefore Professor Howison's philosophical union at the university of\nCalifornia, brought it forward again and made a special application\nof it to religion. By that date (1898) the times seemed ripe for its\nreception. The word 'pragmatism' spread, and at present it fairly\nspots the pages of the philosophic journals. On all hands we find the\n'pragmatic movement' spoken of, sometimes with respect, sometimes with\ncontumely, seldom with clear understanding. It is evident that the term\napplies itself conveniently to a number of tendencies that hitherto have\nlacked a collective name, and that it has 'come to stay.'\nTo take in the importance of Peirce's principle, one must get accustomed\nto applying it to concrete cases. I found a few years ago that Ostwald,\nthe illustrious Leipzig chemist, had been making perfectly distinct\nuse of the principle of pragmatism in his lectures on the philosophy of\nscience, tho he had not called it by that name.\n\"All realities influence our practice,\" he wrote me, \"and that influence\nis their meaning for us. I am accustomed to put questions to my classes\nin this way: In what respects would the world be different if this\nalternative or that were true? If I can find nothing that would become\ndifferent, then the alternative has no sense.\"\nThat is, the rival views mean practically the same thing, and meaning,\nother than practical, there is for us none. Ostwald in a published\nlecture gives this example of what he means. Chemists have long wrangled\nover the inner constitution of certain bodies called 'tautomerous.'\nTheir properties seemed equally consistent with the notion that an\ninstable hydrogen atom oscillates inside of them, or that they are\ninstable mixtures of two bodies. Controversy raged; but never was\ndecided. \"It would never have begun,\" says Ostwald, \"if the combatants\nhad asked themselves what particular experimental fact could have been\nmade different by one or the other view being correct. For it would then\nhave appeared that no difference of fact could possibly ensue; and the\nquarrel was as unreal as if, theorizing in primitive times about the\nraising of dough by yeast, one party should have invoked a 'brownie,'\nwhile another insisted on an 'elf' as the true cause of the phenomenon.\"\n[Footnote: 'Theorie und Praxis,' Zeitsch. des Oesterreichischen\nIngenieur u. Architecten-Vereines, 1905, Nr. 4 u. 6. I find a still\nmore radical pragmatism than Ostwald's in an address by Professor W.\nS. Franklin: \"I think that the sickliest notion of physics, even if a\nstudent gets it, is that it is 'the science of masses, molecules and the\nether.' And I think that the healthiest notion, even if a student does\nnot wholly get it, is that physics is the science of the ways of taking\nhold of bodies and pushing them!\" (Science, January 2, 1903.)]\nIt is astonishing to see how many philosophical disputes collapse\ninto insignificance the moment you subject them to this simple test of\ntracing a concrete consequence. There can BE no difference any-where\nthat doesn't MAKE a difference elsewhere--no difference in abstract\ntruth that doesn't express itself in a difference in concrete fact and\nin conduct consequent upon that fact, imposed on somebody, somehow,\nsomewhere and somewhen. The whole function of philosophy ought to be\nto find out what definite difference it will make to you and me,\nat definite instants of our life, if this world-formula or that\nworld-formula be the true one.\nThere is absolutely nothing new in the pragmatic method. Socrates was\nan adept at it. Aristotle used it methodically. Locke, Berkeley and Hume\nmade momentous contributions to truth by its means. Shadworth Hodgson\nkeeps insisting that realities are only what they are 'known-as.'\nBut these forerunners of pragmatism used it in fragments: they were\npreluders only. Not until in our time has it generalized itself, become\nconscious of a universal mission, pretended to a conquering destiny. I\nbelieve in that destiny, and I hope I may end by inspiring you with my\nbelief.\nPragmatism represents a perfectly familiar attitude in philosophy, the\nempiricist attitude, but it represents it, as it seems to me, both in\na more radical and in a less objectionable form than it has ever yet\nassumed. A pragmatist turns his back resolutely and once for all upon\na lot of inveterate habits dear to professional philosophers. He turns\naway from abstraction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions, from bad\na priori reasons, from fixed principles, closed systems, and pretended\nabsolutes and origins. He turns towards concreteness and adequacy,\ntowards facts, towards action, and towards power. That means the\nempiricist temper regnant, and the rationalist temper sincerely given\nup. It means the open air and possibilities of nature, as against dogma,\nartificiality and the pretence of finality in truth.\nAt the same time it does not stand for any special results. It is\na method only. But the general triumph of that method would mean an\nenormous change in what I called in my last lecture the 'temperament'\nof philosophy. Teachers of the ultra-rationalistic type would be frozen\nout, much as the courtier type is frozen out in republics, as the\nultramontane type of priest is frozen out in protestant lands. Science\nand metaphysics would come much nearer together, would in fact work\nabsolutely hand in hand.\nMetaphysics has usually followed a very primitive kind of quest. You\nknow how men have always hankered after unlawful magic, and you know\nwhat a great part, in magic, WORDS have always played. If you have his\nname, or the formula of incantation that binds him, you can control the\nspirit, genie, afrite, or whatever the power may be. Solomon knew the\nnames of all the spirits, and having their names, he held them subject\nto his will. So the universe has always appeared to the natural mind as\na kind of enigma, of which the key must be sought in the shape of\nsome illuminating or power-bringing word or name. That word names the\nuniverse's PRINCIPLE, and to possess it is, after a fashion, to\npossess the universe itself. 'God,' 'Matter,' 'Reason,' 'the Absolute,'\n'Energy,' are so many solving names. You can rest when you have them.\nYou are at the end of your metaphysical quest.\nBut if you follow the pragmatic method, you cannot look on any such word\nas closing your quest. You must bring out of each word its practical\ncash-value, set it at work within the stream of your experience. It\nappears less as a solution, then, than as a program for more work,\nand more particularly as an indication of the ways in which existing\nrealities may be CHANGED.\nTHEORIES THUS BECOME INSTRUMENTS, NOT ANSWERS TO ENIGMAS, IN WHICH\nWE CAN REST. We don't lie back upon them, we move forward, and, on\noccasion, make nature over again by their aid. Pragmatism unstiffens all\nour theories, limbers them up and sets each one at work. Being nothing\nessentially new, it harmonizes with many ancient philosophic tendencies.\nIt agrees with nominalism for instance, in always appealing to\nparticulars; with utilitarianism in emphasizing practical aspects; with\npositivism in its disdain for verbal solutions, useless questions, and\nmetaphysical abstractions.\nAll these, you see, are ANTI-INTELLECTUALIST tendencies. Against\nrationalism as a pretension and a method, pragmatism is fully armed\nand militant. But, at the outset, at least, it stands for no particular\nresults. It has no dogmas, and no doctrines save its method. As the\nyoung Italian pragmatist Papini has well said, it lies in the midst of\nour theories, like a corridor in a hotel. Innumerable chambers open out\nof it. In one you may find a man writing an atheistic volume; in the\nnext someone on his knees praying for faith and strength; in a third\na chemist investigating a body's properties. In a fourth a system\nof idealistic metaphysics is being excogitated; in a fifth the\nimpossibility of metaphysics is being shown. But they all own the\ncorridor, and all must pass through it if they want a practicable way of\ngetting into or out of their respective rooms.\nNo particular results then, so far, but only an attitude of orientation,\nis what the pragmatic method means. THE ATTITUDE OF LOOKING AWAY FROM\nFIRST THINGS, PRINCIPLES, 'CATEGORIES,' SUPPOSED NECESSITIES; AND OF\nLOOKING TOWARDS LAST THINGS, FRUITS, CONSEQUENCES, FACTS.\nSo much for the pragmatic method! You may say that I have been praising\nit rather than explaining it to you, but I shall presently explain it\nabundantly enough by showing how it works on some familiar problems.\nMeanwhile the word pragmatism has come to be used in a still wider\nsense, as meaning also a certain theory of TRUTH. I mean to give a whole\nlecture to the statement of that theory, after first paving the way,\nso I can be very brief now. But brevity is hard to follow, so I ask\nfor your redoubled attention for a quarter of an hour. If much remains\nobscure, I hope to make it clearer in the later lectures.\nOne of the most successfully cultivated branches of philosophy in our\ntime is what is called inductive logic, the study of the conditions\nunder which our sciences have evolved. Writers on this subject have\nbegun to show a singular unanimity as to what the laws of nature and\nelements of fact mean, when formulated by mathematicians, physicists and\nchemists. When the first mathematical, logical and natural uniformities,\nthe first LAWS, were discovered, men were so carried away by the\nclearness, beauty and simplification that resulted, that they believed\nthemselves to have deciphered authentically the eternal thoughts of the\nAlmighty. His mind also thundered and reverberated in syllogisms.\nHe also thought in conic sections, squares and roots and ratios, and\ngeometrized like Euclid. He made Kepler's laws for the planets to\nfollow; he made velocity increase proportionally to the time in falling\nbodies; he made the law of the sines for light to obey when refracted;\nhe established the classes, orders, families and genera of plants and\nanimals, and fixed the distances between them. He thought the archetypes\nof all things, and devised their variations; and when we rediscover any\none of these his wondrous institutions, we seize his mind in its very\nliteral intention.\nBut as the sciences have developed farther, the notion has gained ground\nthat most, perhaps all, of our laws are only approximations. The laws\nthemselves, moreover, have grown so numerous that there is no counting\nthem; and so many rival formulations are proposed in all the branches of\nscience that investigators have become accustomed to the notion that no\ntheory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but that any one of them\nmay from some point of view be useful. Their great use is to summarize\nold facts and to lead to new ones. They are only a man-made language,\na conceptual shorthand, as someone calls them, in which we write our\nreports of nature; and languages, as is well known, tolerate much choice\nof expression and many dialects.\nThus human arbitrariness has driven divine necessity from scientific\nlogic. If I mention the names of Sigwart, Mach, Ostwald, Pearson,\nMilhaud, Poincare, Duhem, Ruyssen, those of you who are students will\neasily identify the tendency I speak of, and will think of additional\nnames.\nRiding now on the front of this wave of scientific logic Messrs.\nSchiller and Dewey appear with their pragmatistic account of what truth\neverywhere signifies. Everywhere, these teachers say, 'truth' in our\nideas and beliefs means the same thing that it means in science. It\nmeans, they say, nothing but this, THAT IDEAS (WHICH THEMSELVES ARE BUT\nPARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE) BECOME TRUE JUST IN SO FAR AS THEY HELP US TO\nGET INTO SATISFACTORY RELATION WITH OTHER PARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE, to\nsummarize them and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts instead\nof following the interminable succession of particular phenomena. Any\nidea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that will carry us\nprosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part,\nlinking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying,\nsaving labor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true\nINSTRUMENTALLY. This is the 'instrumental' view of truth taught so\nsuccessfully at Chicago, the view that truth in our ideas means their\npower to 'work,' promulgated so brilliantly at Oxford.\nMessrs. Dewey, Schiller and their allies, in reaching this general\nconception of all truth, have only followed the example of geologists,\nbiologists and philologists. In the establishment of these other\nsciences, the successful stroke was always to take some simple process\nactually observable in operation--as denudation by weather, say, or\nvariation from parental type, or change of dialect by incorporation of\nnew words and pronunciations--and then to generalize it, making it apply\nto all times, and produce great results by summating its effects through\nthe ages.\nThe observable process which Schiller and Dewey particularly singled out\nfor generalization is the familiar one by which any individual settles\ninto NEW OPINIONS. The process here is always the same. The individual\nhas a stock of old opinions already, but he meets a new experience that\nputs them to a strain. Somebody contradicts them; or in a reflective\nmoment he discovers that they contradict each other; or he hears of\nfacts with which they are incompatible; or desires arise in him which\nthey cease to satisfy. The result is an inward trouble to which his\nmind till then had been a stranger, and from which he seeks to escape\nby modifying his previous mass of opinions. He saves as much of it as he\ncan, for in this matter of belief we are all extreme conservatives. So\nhe tries to change first this opinion, and then that (for they resist\nchange very variously), until at last some new idea comes up which he\ncan graft upon the ancient stock with a minimum of disturbance of the\nlatter, some idea that mediates between the stock and the new experience\nand runs them into one another most felicitously and expediently.\nThis new idea is then adopted as the true one. It preserves the older\nstock of truths with a minimum of modification, stretching them just\nenough to make them admit the novelty, but conceiving that in ways as\nfamiliar as the case leaves possible. An outree explanation, violating\nall our preconceptions, would never pass for a true account of a\nnovelty. We should scratch round industriously till we found something\nless excentric. The most violent revolutions in an individual's beliefs\nleave most of his old order standing. Time and space, cause and effect,\nnature and history, and one's own biography remain untouched. New truth\nis always a go-between, a smoother-over of transitions. It marries old\nopinion to new fact so as ever to show a minimum of jolt, a maximum of\ncontinuity. We hold a theory true just in proportion to its success in\nsolving this 'problem of maxima and minima.' But success in solving\nthis problem is eminently a matter of approximation. We say this theory\nsolves it on the whole more satisfactorily than that theory; but that\nmeans more satisfactorily to ourselves, and individuals will emphasize\ntheir points of satisfaction differently. To a certain degree,\ntherefore, everything here is plastic.\nThe point I now urge you to observe particularly is the part played by\nthe older truths. Failure to take account of it is the source of much\nof the unjust criticism leveled against pragmatism. Their influence is\nabsolutely controlling. Loyalty to them is the first principle--in\nmost cases it is the only principle; for by far the most usual way\nof handling phenomena so novel that they would make for a serious\nrearrangement of our preconceptions is to ignore them altogether, or to\nabuse those who bear witness for them.\nYou doubtless wish examples of this process of truth's growth, and the\nonly trouble is their superabundance. The simplest case of new truth is\nof course the mere numerical addition of new kinds of facts, or of new\nsingle facts of old kinds, to our experience--an addition that involves\nno alteration in the old beliefs. Day follows day, and its contents are\nsimply added. The new contents themselves are not true, they simply COME\nand ARE. Truth is what we say about them, and when we say that they have\ncome, truth is satisfied by the plain additive formula.\nBut often the day's contents oblige a rearrangement. If I should now\nutter piercing shrieks and act like a maniac on this platform, it\nwould make many of you revise your ideas as to the probable worth of my\nphilosophy. 'Radium' came the other day as part of the day's content,\nand seemed for a moment to contradict our ideas of the whole order of\nnature, that order having come to be identified with what is called\nthe conservation of energy. The mere sight of radium paying heat away\nindefinitely out of its own pocket seemed to violate that conservation.\nWhat to think? If the radiations from it were nothing but an escape of\nunsuspected 'potential' energy, pre-existent inside of the atoms, the\nprinciple of conservation would be saved. The discovery of 'helium' as\nthe radiation's outcome, opened a way to this belief. So Ramsay's view\nis generally held to be true, because, altho it extends our old ideas of\nenergy, it causes a minimum of alteration in their nature.\nI need not multiply instances. A new opinion counts as 'true' just in\nproportion as it gratifies the individual's desire to assimilate the\nnovel in his experience to his beliefs in stock. It must both lean on\nold truth and grasp new fact; and its success (as I said a moment ago)\nin doing this, is a matter for the individual's appreciation. When\nold truth grows, then, by new truth's addition, it is for subjective\nreasons. We are in the process and obey the reasons. That new idea is\ntruest which performs most felicitously its function of satisfying our\ndouble urgency. It makes itself true, gets itself classed as true, by\nthe way it works; grafting itself then upon the ancient body of truth,\nwhich thus grows much as a tree grows by the activity of a new layer of\ncambium.\nNow Dewey and Schiller proceed to generalize this observation and\nto apply it to the most ancient parts of truth. They also once were\nplastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also\nmediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel\nobservations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose establishment the\nfunction of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of\nexperience with newer parts played no role whatever, is nowhere to be\nfound. The reasons why we call things true is the reason why they ARE\ntrue, for 'to be true' MEANS only to perform this marriage-function.\nThe trail of the human serpent is thus over everything. Truth\nindependent; truth that we FIND merely; truth no longer malleable to\nhuman need; truth incorrigible, in a word; such truth exists indeed\nsuperabundantly--or is supposed to exist by rationalistically minded\nthinkers; but then it means only the dead heart of the living tree, and\nits being there means only that truth also has its paleontology and its\n'prescription,' and may grow stiff with years of veteran service and\npetrified in men's regard by sheer antiquity. But how plastic even the\noldest truths nevertheless really are has been vividly shown in our\nday by the transformation of logical and mathematical ideas, a\ntransformation which seems even to be invading physics. The ancient\nformulas are reinterpreted as special expressions of much wider\nprinciples, principles that our ancestors never got a glimpse of in\ntheir present shape and formulation.\nMr. Schiller still gives to all this view of truth the name of\n'Humanism,' but, for this doctrine too, the name of pragmatism seems\nfairly to be in the ascendant, so I will treat it under the name of\npragmatism in these lectures.\nSuch then would be the scope of pragmatism--first, a method; and second,\na genetic theory of what is meant by truth. And these two things must be\nour future topics.\nWhat I have said of the theory of truth will, I am sure, have appeared\nobscure and unsatisfactory to most of you by reason of us brevity. I\nshall make amends for that hereafter. In a lecture on 'common sense' I\nshall try to show what I mean by truths grown petrified by antiquity. In\nanother lecture I shall expatiate on the idea that our thoughts become\ntrue in proportion as they successfully exert their go-between function.\nIn a third I shall show how hard it is to discriminate subjective from\nobjective factors in Truth's development. You may not follow me wholly\nin these lectures; and if you do, you may not wholly agree with me. But\nyou will, I know, regard me at least as serious, and treat my effort\nwith respectful consideration.\nYou will probably be surprised to learn, then, that Messrs. Schiller's\nand Dewey's theories have suffered a hailstorm of contempt and ridicule.\nAll rationalism has risen against them. In influential quarters Mr.\nSchiller, in particular, has been treated like an impudent schoolboy who\ndeserves a spanking. I should not mention this, but for the fact that it\nthrows so much sidelight upon that rationalistic temper to which I have\nopposed the temper of pragmatism. Pragmatism is uncomfortable away from\nfacts. Rationalism is comfortable only in the presence of abstractions.\nThis pragmatist talk about truths in the plural, about their utility\nand satisfactoriness, about the success with which they 'work,' etc.,\nsuggests to the typical intellectualist mind a sort of coarse lame\nsecond-rate makeshift article of truth. Such truths are not real truth.\nSuch tests are merely subjective. As against this, objective truth must\nbe something non-utilitarian, haughty, refined, remote, august, exalted.\nIt must be an absolute correspondence of our thoughts with an equally\nabsolute reality. It must be what we OUGHT to think, unconditionally.\nThe conditioned ways in which we DO think are so much irrelevance and\nmatter for psychology. Down with psychology, up with logic, in all this\nquestion!\nSee the exquisite contrast of the types of mind! The pragmatist clings\nto facts and concreteness, observes truth at its work in particular\ncases, and generalizes. Truth, for him, becomes a class-name for all\nsorts of definite working-values in experience. For the rationalist it\nremains a pure abstraction, to the bare name of which we must defer.\nWhen the pragmatist undertakes to show in detail just WHY we must defer,\nthe rationalist is unable to recognize the concretes from which his own\nabstraction is taken. He accuses us of DENYING truth; whereas we have\nonly sought to trace exactly why people follow it and always ought\nto follow it. Your typical ultra-abstractionist fairly shudders at\nconcreteness: other things equal, he positively prefers the pale and\nspectral. If the two universes were offered, he would always choose the\nskinny outline rather than the rich thicket of reality. It is so much\npurer, clearer, nobler.\nI hope that as these lectures go on, the concreteness and closeness to\nfacts of the pragmatism which they advocate may be what approves itself\nto you as its most satisfactory peculiarity. It only follows here the\nexample of the sister-sciences, interpreting the unobserved by the\nobserved. It brings old and new harmoniously together. It converts the\nabsolutely empty notion of a static relation of 'correspondence' (what\nthat may mean we must ask later) between our minds and reality, into\nthat of a rich and active commerce (that anyone may follow in detail and\nunderstand) between particular thoughts of ours, and the great universe\nof other experiences in which they play their parts and have their uses.\nBut enough of this at present? The justification of what I say must be\npostponed. I wish now to add a word in further explanation of the claim\nI made at our last meeting, that pragmatism may be a happy harmonizer\nof empiricist ways of thinking, with the more religious demands of human\nbeings.\nMen who are strongly of the fact-loving temperament, you may remember me\nto have said, are liable to be kept at a distance by the small sympathy\nwith facts which that philosophy from the present-day fashion of\nidealism offers them. It is far too intellectualistic. Old fashioned\ntheism was bad enough, with its notion of God as an exalted monarch,\nmade up of a lot of unintelligible or preposterous 'attributes'; but, so\nlong as it held strongly by the argument from design, it kept some touch\nwith concrete realities. Since, however, darwinism has once for all\ndisplaced design from the minds of the 'scientific,' theism has lost\nthat foothold; and some kind of an immanent or pantheistic deity working\nIN things rather than above them is, if any, the kind recommended to our\ncontemporary imagination. Aspirants to a philosophic religion turn, as a\nrule, more hopefully nowadays towards idealistic pantheism than towards\nthe older dualistic theism, in spite of the fact that the latter still\ncounts able defenders.\nBut, as I said in my first lecture, the brand of pantheism offered is\nhard for them to assimilate if they are lovers of facts, or empirically\nminded. It is the absolutistic brand, spurning the dust and reared upon\npure logic. It keeps no connexion whatever with concreteness. Affirming\nthe Absolute Mind, which is its substitute for God, to be the rational\npresupposition of all particulars of fact, whatever they may be, it\nremains supremely indifferent to what the particular facts in our world\nactually are. Be they what they may, the Absolute will father them. Like\nthe sick lion in Esop's fable, all footprints lead into his den,\nbut nulla vestigia retrorsum. You cannot redescend into the world of\nparticulars by the Absolute's aid, or deduce any necessary consequences\nof detail important for your life from your idea of his nature. He gives\nyou indeed the assurance that all is well with Him, and for his eternal\nway of thinking; but thereupon he leaves you to be finitely saved by\nyour own temporal devices.\nFar be it from me to deny the majesty of this conception, or its\ncapacity to yield religious comfort to a most respectable class of\nminds. But from the human point of view, no one can pretend that it\ndoesn't suffer from the faults of remoteness and abstractness. It is\neminently a product of what I have ventured to call the rationalistic\ntemper. It disdains empiricism's needs. It substitutes a pallid outline\nfor the real world's richness. It is dapper; it is noble in the bad\nsense, in the sense in which to be noble is to be inapt for humble\nservice. In this real world of sweat and dirt, it seems to me that\nwhen a view of things is 'noble,' that ought to count as a presumption\nagainst its truth, and as a philosophic disqualification. The prince of\ndarkness may be a gentleman, as we are told he is, but whatever the\nGod of earth and heaven is, he can surely be no gentleman. His menial\nservices are needed in the dust of our human trials, even more than his\ndignity is needed in the empyrean.\nNow pragmatism, devoted tho she be to facts, has no such materialistic\nbias as ordinary empiricism labors under. Moreover, she has no objection\nwhatever to the realizing of abstractions, so long as you get about\namong particulars with their aid and they actually carry you somewhere.\nInterested in no conclusions but those which our minds and our\nexperiences work out together, she has no a priori prejudices against\ntheology. IF THEOLOGICAL IDEAS PROVE TO HAVE A VALUE FOR CONCRETE LIFE,\nTHEY WILL BE TRUE, FOR PRAGMATISM, IN THE SENSE OF BEING GOOD FOR SO\nMUCH. FOR HOW MUCH MORE THEY ARE TRUE, WILL DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THEIR\nRELATIONS TO THE OTHER TRUTHS THAT ALSO HAVE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED.\nWhat I said just now about the Absolute of transcendental idealism is a\ncase in point. First, I called it majestic and said it yielded religious\ncomfort to a class of minds, and then I accused it of remoteness and\nsterility. But so far as it affords such comfort, it surely is not\nsterile; it has that amount of value; it performs a concrete function.\nAs a good pragmatist, I myself ought to call the Absolute true 'in so\nfar forth,' then; and I unhesitatingly now do so.\nBut what does TRUE IN SO FAR FORTH mean in this case? To answer, we need\nonly apply the pragmatic method. What do believers in the Absolute mean\nby saying that their belief affords them comfort? They mean that since\nin the Absolute finite evil is 'overruled' already, we may, therefore,\nwhenever we wish, treat the temporal as if it were potentially the\neternal, be sure that we can trust its outcome, and, without sin,\ndismiss our fear and drop the worry of our finite responsibility. In\nshort, they mean that we have a right ever and anon to take a moral\nholiday, to let the world wag in its own way, feeling that its issues\nare in better hands than ours and are none of our business.\nThe universe is a system of which the individual members may relax their\nanxieties occasionally, in which the don't-care mood is also right for\nmen, and moral holidays in order--that, if I mistake not, is part, at\nleast, of what the Absolute is 'known-as,' that is the great difference\nin our particular experiences which his being true makes for us, that\nis part of his cash-value when he is pragmatically interpreted. Farther\nthan that the ordinary lay-reader in philosophy who thinks favorably of\nabsolute idealism does not venture to sharpen his conceptions. He can\nuse the Absolute for so much, and so much is very precious. He is pained\nat hearing you speak incredulously of the Absolute, therefore, and\ndisregards your criticisms because they deal with aspects of the\nconception that he fails to follow.\nIf the Absolute means this, and means no more than this, who can\npossibly deny the truth of it? To deny it would be to insist that men\nshould never relax, and that holidays are never in order. I am well\naware how odd it must seem to some of you to hear me say that an idea is\n'true' so long as to believe it is profitable to our lives. That it is\nGOOD, for as much as it profits, you will gladly admit. If what we do\nby its aid is good, you will allow the idea itself to be good in so far\nforth, for we are the better for possessing it. But is it not a strange\nmisuse of the word 'truth,' you will say, to call ideas also 'true' for\nthis reason?\nTo answer this difficulty fully is impossible at this stage of\nmy account. You touch here upon the very central point of Messrs.\nSchiller's, Dewey's and my own doctrine of truth, which I cannot discuss\nwith detail until my sixth lecture. Let me now say only this, that truth\nis ONE SPECIES OF GOOD, and not, as is usually supposed, a category\ndistinct from good, and co-ordinate with it. THE TRUE IS THE NAME OF\nWHATEVER PROVES ITSELF TO BE GOOD IN THE WAY OF BELIEF, AND GOOD, TOO,\nFOR DEFINITE, ASSIGNABLE REASONS. Surely you must admit this, that if\nthere were NO good for life in true ideas, or if the knowledge of them\nwere positively disadvantageous and false ideas the only useful ones,\nthen the current notion that truth is divine and precious, and its\npursuit a duty, could never have grown up or become a dogma. In a world\nlike that, our duty would be to SHUN truth, rather. But in this world,\njust as certain foods are not only agreeable to our taste, but good for\nour teeth, our stomach and our tissues; so certain ideas are not only\nagreeable to think about, or agreeable as supporting other ideas that we\nare fond of, but they are also helpful in life's practical struggles. If\nthere be any life that it is really better we should lead, and if there\nbe any idea which, if believed in, would help us to lead that life,\nthen it would be really BETTER FOR US to believe in that idea, UNLESS,\nINDEED, BELIEF IN IT INCIDENTALLY CLASHED WITH OTHER GREATER VITAL\nBENEFITS.\n'What would be better for us to believe'! This sounds very like a\ndefinition of truth. It comes very near to saying 'what we OUGHT to\nbelieve': and in THAT definition none of you would find any oddity.\nOught we ever not to believe what it is BETTER FOR US to believe? And\ncan we then keep the notion of what is better for us, and what is true\nfor us, permanently apart?\nPragmatism says no, and I fully agree with her. Probably you also agree,\nso far as the abstract statement goes, but with a suspicion that if\nwe practically did believe everything that made for good in our own\npersonal lives, we should be found indulging all kinds of fancies about\nthis world's affairs, and all kinds of sentimental superstitions about a\nworld hereafter. Your suspicion here is undoubtedly well founded, and it\nis evident that something happens when you pass from the abstract to the\nconcrete, that complicates the situation.\nI said just now that what is better for us to believe is true UNLESS THE\nBELIEF INCIDENTALLY CLASHES WITH SOME OTHER VITAL BENEFIT. Now in real\nlife what vital benefits is any particular belief of ours most liable\nto clash with? What indeed except the vital benefits yielded by OTHER\nBELIEFS when these prove incompatible with the first ones? In other\nwords, the greatest enemy of any one of our truths may be the rest\nof our truths. Truths have once for all this desperate instinct of\nself-preservation and of desire to extinguish whatever contradicts them.\nMy belief in the Absolute, based on the good it does me, must run the\ngauntlet of all my other beliefs. Grant that it may be true in giving me\na moral holiday. Nevertheless, as I conceive it,--and let me speak now\nconfidentially, as it were, and merely in my own private person,--it\nclashes with other truths of mine whose benefits I hate to give up on\nits account. It happens to be associated with a kind of logic of which I\nam the enemy, I find that it entangles me in metaphysical paradoxes\nthat are inacceptable, etc., etc.. But as I have enough trouble in\nlife already without adding the trouble of carrying these intellectual\ninconsistencies, I personally just give up the Absolute. I just TAKE my\nmoral holidays; or else as a professional philosopher, I try to justify\nthem by some other principle.\nIf I could restrict my notion of the Absolute to its bare holiday-giving\nvalue, it wouldn't clash with my other truths. But we cannot easily thus\nrestrict our hypotheses. They carry supernumerary features, and these it\nis that clash so. My disbelief in the Absolute means then disbelief\nin those other supernumerary features, for I fully believe in the\nlegitimacy of taking moral holidays.\nYou see by this what I meant when I called pragmatism a mediator and\nreconciler and said, borrowing the word from Papini, that he unstiffens\nour theories. She has in fact no prejudices whatever, no obstructive\ndogmas, no rigid canons of what shall count as proof. She is completely\ngenial. She will entertain any hypothesis, she will consider any\nevidence. It follows that in the religious field she is at a great\nadvantage both over positivistic empiricism, with its anti-theological\nbias, and over religious rationalism, with its exclusive interest in\nthe remote, the noble, the simple, and the abstract in the way of\nconception.\nIn short, she widens the field of search for God. Rationalism sticks\nto logic and the empyrean. Empiricism sticks to the external senses.\nPragmatism is willing to take anything, to follow either logic or the\nsenses, and to count the humblest and most personal experiences. She\nwill count mystical experiences if they have practical consequences.\nShe will take a God who lives in the very dirt of private fact-if that\nshould seem a likely place to find him.\nHer only test of probable truth is what works best in the way of leading\nus, what fits every part of life best and combines with the collectivity\nof experience's demands, nothing being omitted. If theological ideas\nshould do this, if the notion of God, in particular, should prove to do\nit, how could pragmatism possibly deny God's existence? She could see\nno meaning in treating as 'not true' a notion that was pragmatically so\nsuccessful. What other kind of truth could there be, for her, than all\nthis agreement with concrete reality?\nIn my last lecture I shall return again to the relations of pragmatism\nwith religion. But you see already how democratic she is. Her manners\nare as various and flexible, her resources as rich and endless, and her\nconclusions as friendly as those of mother nature.\nLecture III\nSome Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered\nI am now to make the pragmatic method more familiar by giving you some\nillustrations of its application to particular problems. I will begin\nwith what is driest, and the first thing I shall take will be the\nproblem of Substance. Everyone uses the old distinction between\nsubstance and attribute, enshrined as it is in the very structure\nof human language, in the difference between grammatical subject and\npredicate. Here is a bit of blackboard crayon. Its modes, attributes,\nproperties, accidents, or affections,--use which term you will,--are\nwhiteness, friability, cylindrical shape, insolubility in water,\netc., etc. But the bearer of these attributes is so much chalk,\nwhich thereupon is called the substance in which they inhere. So the\nattributes of this desk inhere in the substance 'wood,' those of my coat\nin the substance 'wool,' and so forth. Chalk, wood and wool, show again,\nin spite of their differences, common properties, and in so far forth\nthey are themselves counted as modes of a still more primal substance,\nmatter, the attributes of which are space occupancy and impenetrability.\nSimilarly our thoughts and feelings are affections or properties of our\nseveral souls, which are substances, but again not wholly in their own\nright, for they are modes of the still deeper substance 'spirit.'\nNow it was very early seen that all we know of the chalk is\nthe whiteness, friability, etc., all WE KNOW of the wood is the\ncombustibility and fibrous structure. A group of attributes is what each\nsubstance here is known-as, they form its sole cash-value for our actual\nexperience. The substance is in every case revealed through THEM; if we\nwere cut off from THEM we should never suspect its existence; and if\nGod should keep sending them to us in an unchanged order, miraculously\nannihilating at a certain moment the substance that supported them, we\nnever could detect the moment, for our experiences themselves would be\nunaltered. Nominalists accordingly adopt the opinion that substance is\na spurious idea due to our inveterate human trick of turning names\ninto things. Phenomena come in groups--the chalk-group, the wood-group,\netc.--and each group gets its name. The name we then treat as in a\nway supporting the group of phenomena. The low thermometer to-day,\nfor instance, is supposed to come from something called the 'climate.'\nClimate is really only the name for a certain group of days, but it is\ntreated as if it lay BEHIND the day, and in general we place the name,\nas if it were a being, behind the facts it is the name of. But the\nphenomenal properties of things, nominalists say, surely do not\nreally inhere in names, and if not in names then they do not inhere\nin anything. They ADhere, or COhere, rather, WITH EACH OTHER, and the\nnotion of a substance inaccessible to us, which we think accounts\nfor such cohesion by supporting it, as cement might support pieces of\nmosaic, must be abandoned. The fact of the bare cohesion itself is all\nthat the notion of the substance signifies. Behind that fact is nothing.\nScholasticism has taken the notion of substance from common sense and\nmade it very technical and articulate. Few things would seem to have\nfewer pragmatic consequences for us than substances, cut off as we are\nfrom every contact with them. Yet in one case scholasticism has proved\nthe importance of the substance-idea by treating it pragmatically. I\nrefer to certain disputes about the mystery of the Eucharist. Substance\nhere would appear to have momentous pragmatic value. Since the accidents\nof the wafer don't change in the Lord's supper, and yet it has become\nthe very body of Christ, it must be that the change is in the substance\nsolely. The bread-substance must have been withdrawn, and the divine\nsubstance substituted miraculously without altering the immediate\nsensible properties. But tho these don't alter, a tremendous difference\nhas been made, no less a one than this, that we who take the sacrament,\nnow feed upon the very substance of divinity. The substance-notion\nbreaks into life, then, with tremendous effect, if once you allow that\nsubstances can separate from their accidents, and exchange these latter.\nThis is the only pragmatic application of the substance-idea with\nwhich I am acquainted; and it is obvious that it will only be treated\nseriously by those who already believe in the 'real presence' on\nindependent grounds.\nMATERIAL SUBSTANCE was criticized by Berkeley with such telling effect\nthat his name has reverberated through all subsequent philosophy.\nBerkeley's treatment of the notion of matter is so well known as to need\nhardly more than a mention. So far from denying the external world which\nwe know, Berkeley corroborated it. It was the scholastic notion of a\nmaterial substance unapproachable by us, BEHIND the external world,\ndeeper and more real than it, and needed to support it, which Berkeley\nmaintained to be the most effective of all reducers of the external\nworld to unreality. Abolish that substance, he said, believe that God,\nwhom you can understand and approach, sends you the sensible world\ndirectly, and you confirm the latter and back it up by his divine\nauthority. Berkeley's criticism of 'matter' was consequently absolutely\npragmatistic. Matter is known as our sensations of colour, figure,\nhardness and the like. They are the cash-value of the term. The\ndifference matter makes to us by truly being is that we then get such\nsensations; by not being, is that we lack them. These sensations then\nare its sole meaning. Berkeley doesn't deny matter, then; he simply\ntells us what it consists of. It is a true name for just so much in the\nway of sensations.\nLocke, and later Hume, applied a similar pragmatic criticism to the\nnotion of SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE. I will only mention Locke's treatment\nof our 'personal identity.' He immediately reduces this notion to its\npragmatic value in terms of experience. It means, he says, so much\nconsciousness,' namely the fact that at one moment of life we remember\nother moments, and feel them all as parts of one and the same personal\nhistory. Rationalism had explained this practical continuity in our life\nby the unity of our soul-substance. But Locke says: suppose that God\nshould take away the consciousness, should WE be any the better\nfor having still the soul-principle? Suppose he annexed the same\nconsciousness to different souls, | should we, as WE realize OURSELVES,\nbe any the worse for that fact? In Locke's day the soul was chiefly a\nthing to be rewarded or punished. See how Locke, discussing it from this\npoint of view, keeps the question pragmatic:\nSuppose, he says, one to think himself to be the same soul that once was\nNestor or Thersites. Can he think their actions his own any more than\nthe actions of any other man that ever existed? But | let him once find\nhimself CONSCIOUS of any of the actions of Nestor, he then finds himself\nthe same person with Nestor. ... In this personal identity is founded\nall the right and justice of reward and punishment. It may be reasonable\nto think, no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of,\nbut shall receive his doom, his consciousness accusing or excusing.\nSupposing a man punished now for what he had done in another life,\nwhereof he could be made to have no consciousness at all, what\ndifference is there between that punishment and being created miserable?\nOur personal identity, then, consists, for Locke, solely in\npragmatically definable particulars. Whether, apart from these\nverifiable facts, it also inheres in a spiritual principle, is a merely\ncurious speculation. Locke, compromiser that he was, passively tolerated\nthe belief in a substantial soul behind our consciousness. But his\nsuccessor Hume, and most empirical psychologists after him, have denied\nthe soul, save as the name for verifiable cohesions in our inner life.\nThey redescend into the stream of experience with it, and cash it into\nso much small-change value in the way of 'ideas' and their peculiar\nconnexions with each other. As I said of Berkeley's matter, the soul is\ngood or 'true' for just SO MUCH, but no more.\nThe mention of material substance naturally suggests the doctrine of\n'materialism,' but philosophical materialism is not necessarily knit\nup with belief in 'matter,' as a metaphysical principle. One may\ndeny matter in that sense, as strongly as Berkeley did, one may be a\nphenomenalist like Huxley, and yet one may still be a materialist in the\nwider sense, of explaining higher phenomena by lower ones, and leaving\nthe destinies of the world at the mercy of its blinder parts and forces.\nIt is in this wider sense of the word that materialism is opposed to\nspiritualism or theism. The laws of physical nature are what run things,\nmaterialism says. The highest productions of human genius might be\nciphered by one who had complete acquaintance with the facts, out of\ntheir physiological conditions, regardless whether nature be there only\nfor our minds, as idealists contend, or not. Our minds in any case would\nhave to record the kind of nature it is, and write it down as operating\nthrough blind laws of physics. This is the complexion of present day\nmaterialism, which may better be called naturalism. Over against it\nstands 'theism,' or what in a wide sense may be termed 'spiritualism.'\nSpiritualism says that mind not only witnesses and records things, but\nalso runs and operates them: the world being thus guided, not by its\nlower, but by its higher element.\nTreated as it often is, this question becomes little more than a\nconflict between aesthetic preferences. Matter is gross, coarse, crass,\nmuddy; spirit is pure, elevated, noble; and since it is more consonant\nwith the dignity of the universe to give the primacy in it to what\nappears superior, spirit must be affirmed as the ruling principle. To\ntreat abstract principles as finalities, before which our intellects\nmay come to rest in a state of admiring contemplation, is the great\nrationalist failing. Spiritualism, as often held, may be simply a\nstate of admiration for one kind, and of dislike for another kind,\nof abstraction. I remember a worthy spiritualist professor who always\nreferred to materialism as the 'mud-philosophy,' and deemed it thereby\nrefuted.\nTo such spiritualism as this there is an easy answer, and Mr. Spencer\nmakes it effectively. In some well-written pages at the end of the\nfirst volume of his Psychology he shows us that a 'matter' so infinitely\nsubtile, and performing motions as inconceivably quick and fine as those\nwhich modern science postulates in her explanations, has no trace of\ngrossness left. He shows that the conception of spirit, as we mortals\nhitherto have framed it, is itself too gross to cover the exquisite\ntenuity of nature's facts. Both terms, he says, are but symbols,\npointing to that one unknowable reality in which their oppositions\ncease.\nTo an abstract objection an abstract rejoinder suffices; and so far as\none's opposition to materialism springs from one's disdain of matter as\nsomething 'crass,' Mr. Spencer cuts the ground from under one. Matter is\nindeed infinitely and incredibly refined. To anyone who has ever looked\non the face of a dead child or parent the mere fact that matter COULD\nhave taken for a time that precious form, ought to make matter sacred\never after. It makes no difference what the PRINCIPLE of life may be,\nmaterial or immaterial, matter at any rate co-operates, lends itself\nto all life's purposes. That beloved incarnation was among matter's\npossibilities.\nBut now, instead of resting in principles after this stagnant\nintellectualist fashion, let us apply the pragmatic method to the\nquestion. What do we MEAN by matter? What practical difference can it\nmake NOW that the world should be run by matter or by spirit? I think we\nfind that the problem takes with this a rather different character.\nAnd first of all I call your attention to a curious fact. It makes not\na single jot of difference so far as the PAST of the world goes, whether\nwe deem it to have been the work of matter or whether we think a divine\nspirit was its author.\nImagine, in fact, the entire contents of the world to be once for all\nirrevocably given. Imagine it to end this very moment, and to have\nno future; and then let a theist and a materialist apply their rival\nexplanations to its history. The theist shows how a God made it; the\nmaterialist shows, and we will suppose with equal success, how it\nresulted from blind physical forces. Then let the pragmatist be asked to\nchoose between their theories. How can he apply his test if the world\nis already completed? Concepts for him are things to come back into\nexperience with, things to make us look for differences. But by\nhypothesis there is to be no more experience and no possible differences\ncan now be looked for. Both theories have shown all their consequences\nand, by the hypothesis we are adopting, these are identical. The\npragmatist must consequently say that the two theories, in spite of\ntheir different-sounding names, mean exactly the same thing, and that\nthe dispute is purely verbal. [I am opposing, of course, that the\ntheories HAVE been equally successful in their explanations of what is.]\nFor just consider the case sincerely, and say what would be the WORTH\nof a God if he WERE there, with his work accomplished and his world run\ndown. He would be worth no more than just that world was worth. To that\namount of result, with its mixed merits and defects, his creative power\ncould attain, but go no farther. And since there is to be no future;\nsince the whole value and meaning of the world has been already paid in\nand actualized in the feelings that went with it in the passing, and now\ngo with it in the ending; since it draws no supplemental significance\n(such as our real world draws) from its function of preparing something\nyet to come; why then, by it we take God's measure, as it were. He\nis the Being who could once for all do THAT; and for that much we\nare thankful to him, but for nothing more. But now, on the contrary\nhypothesis, namely, that the bits of matter following their laws could\nmake that world and do no less, should we not be just as thankful to\nthem? Wherein should we suffer loss, then, if we dropped God as an\nhypothesis and made the matter alone responsible? Where would any\nspecial deadness, or crassness, come in? And how, experience being what\nis once for all, would God's presence in it make it any more living or\nricher?\nCandidly, it is impossible to give any answer to this question. The\nactually experienced world is supposed to be the same in its details\non either hypothesis, \"the same, for our praise or blame,\" as Browning\nsays. It stands there indefeasibly: a gift which can't be taken back.\nCalling matter the cause of it retracts no single one of the items that\nhave made it up, nor does calling God the cause augment them. They are\nthe God or the atoms, respectively, of just that and no other world. The\nGod, if there, has been doing just what atoms could do--appearing in the\ncharacter of atoms, so to speak--and earning such gratitude as is due to\natoms, and no more. If his presence lends no different turn or issue to\nthe performance, it surely can lend it no increase of dignity. Nor would\nindignity come to it were he absent, and did the atoms remain the only\nactors on the stage. When a play is once over, and the curtain down,\nyou really make it no better by claiming an illustrious genius for its\nauthor, just as you make it no worse by calling him a common hack.\nThus if no future detail of experience or conduct is to be deduced from\nour hypothesis, the debate between materialism and theism becomes quite\nidle and insignificant. Matter and God in that event mean exactly the\nsame thing--the power, namely, neither more nor less, that could make\njust this completed world--and the wise man is he who in such a case\nwould turn his back on such a supererogatory discussion. Accordingly,\nmost men instinctively, and positivists and scientists deliberately,\ndo turn their backs on philosophical disputes from which nothing in the\nline of definite future consequences can be seen to follow. The verbal\nand empty character of philosophy is surely a reproach with which we\nare, but too familiar. If pragmatism be true, it is a perfectly sound\nreproach unless the theories under fire can be shown to have alternative\npractical outcomes, however delicate and distant these may be. The\ncommon man and the scientist say they discover no such outcomes, and if\nthe metaphysician can discern none either, the others certainly are\nin the right of it, as against him. His science is then but pompous\ntrifling; and the endowment of a professorship for such a being would be\nsilly.\nAccordingly, in every genuine metaphysical debate some practical issue,\nhowever conjectural and remote, is involved. To realize this, revert\nwith me to our question, and place yourselves this time in the world we\nlive in, in the world that HAS a future, that is yet uncompleted whilst\nwe speak. In this unfinished world the alternative of 'materialism or\ntheism?' is intensely practical; and it is worth while for us to spend\nsome minutes of our hour in seeing that it is so.\nHow, indeed, does the program differ for us, according as we consider\nthat the facts of experience up to date are purposeless configurations\nof blind atoms moving according to eternal laws, or that on the other\nhand they are due to the providence of God? As far as the past facts\ngo, indeed there is no difference. Those facts are in, are bagged, are\ncaptured; and the good that's in them is gained, be the atoms or be the\nGod their cause. There are accordingly many materialists about us\nto-day who, ignoring altogether the future and practical aspects of the\nquestion, seek to eliminate the odium attaching to the word materialism,\nand even to eliminate the word itself, by showing that, if matter could\ngive birth to all these gains, why then matter, functionally considered,\nis just as divine an entity as God, in fact coalesces with God, is what\nyou mean by God. Cease, these persons advise us, to use either of these\nterms, with their outgrown opposition. Use a term free of the clerical\nconnotations, on the one hand; of the suggestion of gross-ness,\ncoarseness, ignobility, on the other. Talk of the primal mystery, of the\nunknowable energy, of the one and only power, instead of saying either\nGod or matter. This is the course to which Mr. Spencer urges us; and if\nphilosophy were purely retrospective, he would thereby proclaim himself\nan excellent pragmatist.\nBut philosophy is prospective also, and, after finding what the world\nhas been and done and yielded, still asks the further question 'what\ndoes the world PROMISE?' Give us a matter that promises SUCCESS, that is\nbound by its laws to lead our world ever nearer to perfection, and any\nrational man will worship that matter as readily as Mr. Spencer\nworships his own so-called unknowable power. It not only has made for\nrighteousness up to date, but it will make for righteousness forever;\nand that is all we need. Doing practically all that a God can do, it is\nequivalent to God, its function is a God's function, and is exerted in\na world in which a God would now be superfluous; from such a world a God\ncould never lawfully be missed. 'Cosmic emotion' would here be the right\nname for religion.\nBut is the matter by which Mr. Spencer's process of cosmic evolution is\ncarried on any such principle of never-ending perfection as this? Indeed\nit is not, for the future end of every cosmically evolved thing or\nsystem of things is foretold by science to be death and tragedy; and\nMr. Spencer, in confining himself to the aesthetic and ignoring the\npractical side of the controversy, has really contributed nothing\nserious to its relief. But apply now our principle of practical results,\nand see what a vital significance the question of materialism or theism\nimmediately acquires.\nTheism and materialism, so indifferent when taken retrospectively,\npoint, when we take them prospectively, to wholly different outlooks of\nexperience. For, according to the theory of mechanical evolution, the\nlaws of redistribution of matter and motion, tho they are certainly to\nthank for all the good hours which our organisms have ever yielded\nus and for all the ideals which our minds now frame, are yet fatally\ncertain to undo their work again, and to redissolve everything that they\nhave once evolved. You all know the picture of the last state of the\nuniverse which evolutionary science foresees. I cannot state it better\nthan in Mr. Balfour's words: \"The energies of our system will decay, the\nglory of the sun will be dimmed, and the earth, tideless and inert,\nwill no longer tolerate the race which has for a moment disturbed its\nsolitude. Man will go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will\nperish. The uneasy, consciousness which in this obscure corner has for\na brief space broken the contented silence of the universe, will be at\nrest. Matter will know itself no longer. 'Imperishable monuments' and\n'immortal deeds,' death itself, and love stronger than death, will be as\nthough they had never been. Nor will anything that is, be better or be\nworse for all that the labour, genius, devotion, and suffering of man\nhave striven through countless generations to effect.\" [Footnote: The\nFoundations of Belief, p. 30.]\nThat is the sting of it, that in the vast driftings of the cosmic\nweather, tho many a jeweled shore appears, and many an enchanted\ncloud-bank floats away, long lingering ere it be dissolved--even as our\nworld now lingers, for our joy-yet when these transient products are\ngone, nothing, absolutely NOTHING remains, of represent those particular\nqualities, those elements of preciousness which they may have enshrined.\nDead and gone are they, gone utterly from the very sphere and room of\nbeing. Without an echo; without a memory; without an influence on aught\nthat may come after, to make it care for similar ideals. This utter\nfinal wreck and tragedy is of the essence of scientific materialism\nas at present understood. The lower and not the higher forces are the\neternal forces, or the last surviving forces within the only cycle of\nevolution which we can definitely see. Mr. Spencer believes this as much\nas anyone; so why should he argue with us as if we were making silly\naesthetic objections to the 'grossness' of 'matter and motion,' the\nprinciples of his philosophy, when what really dismays us is the\ndisconsolateness of its ulterior practical results?\nNo the true objection to materialism is not positive but negative. It\nwould be farcical at this day to make complaint of it for what it IS for\n'grossness.' Grossness is what grossness DOES--we now know THAT. We make\ncomplaint of it, on the contrary, for what it is NOT--not a permanent\nwarrant for our more ideal interests, not a fulfiller of our remotest\nhopes.\nThe notion of God, on the other hand, however inferior it may be\nin clearness to those mathematical notions so current in mechanical\nphilosophy, has at least this practical superiority over them, that it\nguarantees an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved. A world\nwith a God in it to say the last word, may indeed burn up or freeze,\nbut we then think of him as still mindful of the old ideals and sure to\nbring them elsewhere to fruition; so that, where he is, tragedy is\nonly provisional and partial, and shipwreck and dissolution not the\nabsolutely final things. This need of an eternal moral order is one\nof the deepest needs of our breast. And those poets, like Dante and\nWordsworth, who live on the conviction of such an order, owe to that\nfact the extraordinary tonic and consoling power of their verse. Here\nthen, in these different emotional and practical appeals, in these\nadjustments of our concrete attitudes of hope and expectation, and all\nthe delicate consequences which their differences entail, lie the\nreal meanings of materialism and spiritualism--not in hair-splitting\nabstractions about matter's inner essence, or about the metaphysical\nattributes of God. Materialism means simply the denial that the moral\norder is eternal, and the cutting off of ultimate hopes; spiritualism\nmeans the affirmation of an eternal moral order and the letting loose of\nhope. Surely here is an issue genuine enough, for anyone who feels\nit; and, as long as men are men, it will yield matter for a serious\nphilosophic debate.\nBut possibly some of you may still rally to their defence. Even whilst\nadmitting that spiritualism and materialism make different prophecies\nof the world's future, you may yourselves pooh-pooh the difference as\nsomething so infinitely remote as to mean nothing for a sane mind. The\nessence of a sane mind, you may say, is to take shorter views, and to\nfeel no concern about such chimaeras as the latter end of the world.\nWell, I can only say that if you say this, you do injustice to human\nnature. Religious melancholy is not disposed of by a simple flourish of\nthe word insanity. The absolute things, the last things, the overlapping\nthings, are the truly philosophic concerns; all superior minds feel\nseriously about them, and the mind with the shortest views is simply the\nmind of the more shallow man.\nThe issues of fact at stake in the debate are of course vaguely enough\nconceived by us at present. But spiritualistic faith in all its forms\ndeals with a world of PROMISE, while materialism's sun sets in a sea of\ndisappointment. Remember what I said of the Absolute: it grants us moral\nholidays. Any religious view does this. It not only incites our more\nstrenuous moments, but it also takes our joyous, careless, trustful\nmoments, and it justifies them. It paints the grounds of justification\nvaguely enough, to be sure. The exact features of the saving future\nfacts that our belief in God insures, will have to be ciphered out\nby the interminable methods of science: we can STUDY our God only by\nstudying his Creation. But we can ENJOY our God, if we have one, in\nadvance of all that labor. I myself believe that the evidence for God\nlies primarily in inner personal experiences. When they have once given\nyou your God, his name means at least the benefit of the holiday. You\nremember what I said yesterday about the way in which truths clash and\ntry to 'down' each other. The truth of 'God' has to run the gauntlet of\nall our other truths. It is on trial by them and they on trial by it.\nOur FINAL opinion about God can be settled only after all the truths\nhave straightened themselves out together. Let us hope that they shall\nfind a modus vivendi!\nLet me pass to a very cognate philosophic problem, the QUESTION of\nDESIGN IN NATURE. God's existence has from time immemorial been held to\nbe proved by certain natural facts. Many facts appear as if expressly\ndesigned in view of one another. Thus the woodpecker's bill, tongue,\nfeet, tail, etc., fit him wondrously for a world of trees with grubs hid\nin their bark to feed upon. The parts of our eye fit the laws of light\nto perfection, leading its rays to a sharp picture on our retina. Such\nmutual fitting of things diverse in origin argued design, it was held;\nand the designer was always treated as a man-loving deity.\nThe first step in these arguments was to prove that the design existed.\nNature was ransacked for results obtained through separate things being\nco-adapted. Our eyes, for instance, originate in intra-uterine darkness,\nand the light originates in the sun, yet see how they fit each other.\nThey are evidently made FOR each other. Vision is the end designed,\nlight and eyes the separate means devised for its attainment.\nIt is strange, considering how unanimously our ancestors felt the force\nof this argument, to see how little it counts for since the triumph\nof the darwinian theory. Darwin opened our minds to the power of\nchance-happenings to bring forth 'fit' results if only they have time\nto add themselves together. He showed the enormous waste of nature in\nproducing results that get destroyed because of their unfitness. He also\nemphasized the number of adaptations which, if designed, would argue\nan evil rather than a good designer. Here all depends upon the point\nof view. To the grub under the bark the exquisite fitness of the\nwoodpecker's organism to extract him would certainly argue a diabolical\ndesigner.\nTheologians have by this time stretched their minds so as to embrace\nthe darwinian facts, and yet to interpret them as still showing divine\npurpose. It used to be a question of purpose AGAINST mechanism, of\none OR the other. It was as if one should say \"My shoes are evidently\ndesigned to fit my feet, hence it is impossible that they should have\nbeen produced by machinery.\" We know that they are both: they are made\nby a machinery itself designed to fit the feet with shoes. Theology need\nonly stretch similarly the designs of God. As the aim of a football-team\nis not merely to get the ball to a certain goal (if that were so, they\nwould simply get up on some dark night and place it there), but to get\nit there by a fixed MACHINERY OF CONDITIONS--the game's rules and the\nopposing players; so the aim of God is not merely, let us say, to make\nmen and to save them, but rather to get this done through the sole\nagency of nature's vast machinery. Without nature's stupendous laws and\ncounterforces, man's creation and perfection, we might suppose, would be\ntoo insipid achievements for God to have designed them.\nThis saves the form of the design-argument at the expense of its old\neasy human content. The designer is no longer the old man-like deity.\nHis designs have grown so vast as to be incomprehensible to us humans.\nThe WHAT of them so overwhelms us that to establish the mere THAT of a\ndesigner for them becomes of very little consequence in comparison.\nWe can with difficulty comprehend the character of a cosmic mind whose\npurposes are fully revealed by the strange mixture of goods and evils\nthat we find in this actual world's particulars. Or rather we cannot by\nany possibility comprehend it. The mere word 'design' by itself has,\nwe see, no consequences and explains nothing. It is the barrenest of\nprinciples. The old question of WHETHER there is design is idle.\nThe real question is WHAT is the world, whether or not it have a\ndesigner--and that can be revealed only by the study of all nature's\nparticulars.\nRemember that no matter what nature may have produced or may be\nproducing, the means must necessarily have been adequate, must have been\nFITTED TO THAT PRODUCTION. The argument from fitness to design would\nconsequently always apply, whatever were the product's character. The\nrecent Mont-Pelee eruption, for example, required all previous history\nto produce that exact combination of ruined houses, human and animal\ncorpses, sunken ships, volcanic ashes, etc., in just that one hideous\nconfiguration of positions. France had to be a nation and colonize\nMartinique. Our country had to exist and send our ships there. IF God\naimed at just that result, the means by which the centuries bent their\ninfluences towards it, showed exquisite intelligence. And so of any\nstate of things whatever, either in nature or in history, which we\nfind actually realized. For the parts of things must always make SOME\ndefinite resultant, be it chaotic or harmonious. When we look at what\nhas actually come, the conditions must always appear perfectly designed\nto ensure it. We can always say, therefore, in any conceivable world, of\nany conceivable character, that the whole cosmic machinery MAY have been\ndesigned to produce it.\nPragmatically, then, the abstract word 'design' is a blank cartridge. It\ncarries no consequences, it does no execution. What sort of design? and\nwhat sort of a designer? are the only serious questions, and the study\nof facts is the only way of getting even approximate answers. Meanwhile,\npending the slow answer from facts, anyone who insists that there is a\ndesigner and who is sure he is a divine one, gets a certain pragmatic\nbenefit from the term--the same, in fact which we saw that the terms\nGod, Spirit, or the Absolute, yield us 'Design,' worthless tho it be\nas a mere rationalistic principle set above or behind things for our\nadmiration, becomes, if our faith concretes it into something theistic,\na term of PROMISE. Returning with it into experience, we gain a more\nconfiding outlook on the future. If not a blind force but a seeing\nforce runs things, we may reasonably expect better issues. This vague\nconfidence in the future is the sole pragmatic meaning at present\ndiscernible in the terms design and designer. But if cosmic confidence\nis right not wrong, better not worse, that is a most important meaning.\nThat much at least of possible 'truth' the terms will then have in them.\nLet me take up another well-worn controversy, THE FREE-WILL PROBLEM.\nMost persons who believe in what is called their free-will do so after\nthe rationalistic fashion. It is a principle, a positive faculty or\nvirtue added to man, by which his dignity is enigmatically augmented. He\nought to believe it for this reason. Determinists, who deny it, who say\nthat individual men originate nothing, but merely transmit to the\nfuture the whole push of the past cosmos of which they are so small\nan expression, diminish man. He is less admirable, stripped of this\ncreative principle. I imagine that more than half of you share our\ninstinctive belief in free-will, and that admiration of it as a\nprinciple of dignity has much to do with your fidelity.\nBut free-will has also been discussed pragmatically, and, strangely\nenough, the same pragmatic interpretation has been put upon it by both\ndisputants. You know how large a part questions of ACCOUNTABILITY have\nplayed in ethical controversy. To hear some persons, one would suppose\nthat all that ethics aims at is a code of merits and demerits. Thus does\nthe old legal and theological leaven, the interest in crime and sin and\npunishment abide with us. 'Who's to blame? whom can we punish? whom\nwill God punish?'--these preoccupations hang like a bad dream over man's\nreligious history.\nSo both free-will and determinism have been inveighed against and called\nabsurd, because each, in the eyes of its enemies, has seemed to prevent\nthe 'imputability' of good or bad deeds to their authors. Queer antinomy\nthis! Free-will means novelty, the grafting on to the past of something\nnot involved therein. If our acts were predetermined, if we merely\ntransmitted the push of the whole past, the free-willists say, how could\nwe be praised or blamed for anything? We should be 'agents' only, not\n'principals,' and where then would be our precious imputability and\nresponsibility?\nBut where would it be if we HAD free-will? rejoin the determinists. If a\n'free' act be a sheer novelty, that comes not FROM me, the previous\nme, but ex nihilo, and simply tacks itself on to me, how can _I_, the\nprevious I, be responsible? How can I have any permanent CHARACTER that\nwill stand still long enough for praise or blame to be awarded? The\nchaplet of my days tumbles into a cast of disconnected beads as soon\nas the thread of inner necessity is drawn out by the preposterous\nindeterminist doctrine. Messrs. Fullerton and McTaggart have recently\nlaid about them doughtily with this argument.\nIt may be good ad hominem, but otherwise it is pitiful. For I ask you,\nquite apart from other reasons, whether any man, woman or child, with a\nsense for realities, ought not to be ashamed to plead such principles\nas either dignity or imputability. Instinct and utility between them\ncan safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and\npraise. If a man does good acts we shall praise him, if he does bad acts\nwe shall punish him--anyhow, and quite apart from theories as to whether\nthe acts result from what was previous in him or are novelties in a\nstrict sense. To make our human ethics revolve about the question of\n'merit' is a piteous unreality--God alone can know our merits, if we\nhave any. The real ground for supposing free-will is indeed pragmatic,\nbut it has nothing to do with this contemptible right to punish which\nhad made such a noise in past discussions of the subject.\nFree-will pragmatically means NOVELTIES IN THE WORLD, the right to\nexpect that in its deepest elements as well as in its surface phenomena,\nthe future may not identically repeat and imitate the past. That\nimitation en masse is there, who can deny? The general 'uniformity\nof nature' is presupposed by every lesser law. But nature may be only\napproximately uniform; and persons in whom knowledge of the world's past\nhas bred pessimism (or doubts as to the world's good character, which\nbecome certainties if that character be supposed eternally fixed) may\nnaturally welcome free-will as a MELIORISTIC doctrine. It holds up\nimprovement as at least possible; whereas determinism assures us that\nour whole notion of possibility is born of human ignorance, and that\nnecessity and impossibility between them rule the destinies of the\nworld.\nFree-will is thus a general cosmological theory of PROMISE, just like\nthe Absolute, God, Spirit or Design. Taken abstractly, no one of these\nterms has any inner content, none of them gives us any picture, and\nno one of them would retain the least pragmatic value in a world\nwhose character was obviously perfect from the start. Elation at mere\nexistence, pure cosmic emotion and delight, would, it seems to me,\nquench all interest in those speculations, if the world were nothing but\na lubberland of happiness already. Our interest in religious metaphysics\narises in the fact that our empirical future feels to us unsafe, and\nneeds some higher guarantee. If the past and present were purely good,\nwho could wish that the future might possibly not resemble them? Who\ncould desire free-will? Who would not say, with Huxley, \"let me be wound\nup every day like a watch, to go right fatally, and I ask no better\nfreedom.\" 'Freedom' in a world already perfect could only mean\nfreedom to BE WORSE, and who could be so insane as to wish that? To be\nnecessarily what it is, to be impossibly aught else, would put the\nlast touch of perfection upon optimism's universe. Surely the only\nPOSSIBILITY that one can rationally claim is the possibility that things\nmay be BETTER. That possibility, I need hardly say, is one that, as the\nactual world goes, we have ample grounds for desiderating.\nFree-will thus has no meaning unless it be a doctrine of RELIEF. As\nsuch, it takes its place with other religious doctrines. Between them,\nthey build up the old wastes and repair the former desolations. Our\nspirit, shut within this courtyard of sense-experience, is always saying\nto the intellect upon the tower: 'Watchman, tell us of the night, if it\naught of promise bear,' and the intellect gives it then these terms of\npromise.\nOther than this practical significance, the words God, free-will,\ndesign, etc., have none. Yet dark tho they be in themselves, or\nintellectualistically taken, when we bear them into life's thicket with\nus the darkness THERE grows light about us. If you stop, in dealing with\nsuch words, with their definition, thinking that to be an intellectual\nfinality, where are you? Stupidly staring at a pretentious sham! \"Deus\nest Ens, a se, extra et supra omne genus, necessarium, unum, infinite\nperfectum, simplex, immutabile, immensum, aeternum, intelligens,\"\netc.,--wherein is such a definition really instructive? It means less,\nthan nothing, in its pompous robe of adjectives. Pragmatism alone can\nread a positive meaning into it, and for that she turns her back upon\nthe intellectualist point of view altogether. 'God's in his heaven;\nall's right with the world!'--THAT'S the heart of your theology, and for\nthat you need no rationalist definitions.\nWhy shouldn't we all of us, rationalists as well as pragmatists, confess\nthis? Pragmatism, so far from keeping her eyes bent on the immediate\npractical foreground, as she is accused of doing, dwells just as much\nupon the world's remotest perspectives.\nSee then how all these ultimate questions turn, as it were, up\ntheir hinges; and from looking backwards upon principles, upon an\nerkenntnisstheoretische Ich, a God, a Kausalitaetsprinzip, a Design, a\nFree-will, taken in themselves, as something august and exalted above\nfacts,--see, I say, how pragmatism shifts the emphasis and looks forward\ninto facts themselves. The really vital question for us all is, What is\nthis world going to be? What is life eventually to make of itself? The\ncentre of gravity of philosophy must therefore alter its place. The\nearth of things, long thrown into shadow by the glories of the upper\nether, must resume its rights. To shift the emphasis in this way means\nthat philosophic questions will fall to be treated by minds of a\nless abstractionist type than heretofore, minds more scientific and\nindividualistic in their tone yet not irreligious either. It will be\nan alteration in 'the seat of authority' that reminds one almost of the\nprotestant reformation. And as, to papal minds, protestantism has\noften seemed a mere mess of anarchy and confusion, such, no doubt, will\npragmatism often seem to ultra-rationalist minds in philosophy. It will\nseem so much sheer trash, philosophically. But life wags on, all the\nsame, and compasses its ends, in protestant countries. I venture to\nthink that philosophic protestantism will compass a not dissimilar\nprosperity.\nLecture IV\nThe One and the Many\nWe saw in the last lecture that the pragmatic method, in its dealings\nwith certain concepts, instead of ending with admiring contemplation,\nplunges forward into the river of experience with them and prolongs the\nperspective by their means. Design, free-will, the absolute mind, spirit\ninstead of matter, have for their sole meaning a better promise as to\nthis world's outcome. Be they false or be they true, the meaning of them\nis this meliorism. I have sometimes thought of the phenomenon called\n'total reflexion' in optics as a good symbol of the relation between\nabstract ideas and concrete realities, as pragmatism conceives it. Hold\na tumbler of water a little above your eyes and look up through the\nwater at its surface--or better still look similarly through the flat\nwall of an aquarium. You will then see an extraordinarily brilliant\nreflected image say of a candle-flame, or any other clear object,\nsituated on the opposite side of the vessel. No candle-ray, under these\ncircumstances gets beyond the water's surface: every ray is totally\nreflected back into the depths again. Now let the water represent the\nworld of sensible facts, and let the air above it represent the world of\nabstract ideas. Both worlds are real, of course, and interact; but they\ninteract only at their boundary, and the locus of everything that lives,\nand happens to us, so far as full experience goes, is the water. We are\nlike fishes swimming in the sea of sense, bounded above by the superior\nelement, but unable to breathe it pure or penetrate it. We get our\noxygen from it, however, we touch it incessantly, now in this part, now\nin that, and every time we touch it we are reflected back into the water\nwith our course re-determined and re-energized. The abstract ideas of\nwhich the air consists, indispensable for life, but irrespirable by\nthemselves, as it were, and only active in their re-directing function.\nAll similes are halting but this one rather takes my fancy. It shows\nhow something, not sufficient for life in itself, may nevertheless be an\neffective determinant of life elsewhere.\nIn this present hour I wish to illustrate the pragmatic method by one\nmore application. I wish to turn its light upon the ancient problem\nof 'the one and the many.' I suspect that in but few of you has this\nproblem occasioned sleepless nights, and I should not be astonished if\nsome of you told me it had never vexed you. I myself have come, by long\nbrooding over it, to consider it the most central of all philosophic\nproblems, central because so pregnant. I mean by this that if you know\nwhether a man is a decided monist or a decided pluralist, you perhaps\nknow more about the rest of his opinions than if you give him any other\nname ending in IST. To believe in the one or in the many, that is the\nclassification with the maximum number of consequences. So bear with\nme for an hour while I try to inspire you with my own interest in the\nproblem.\nPhilosophy has often been defined as the quest or the vision of the\nworld's unity. We never hear this definition challenged, and it is true\nas far as it goes, for philosophy has indeed manifested above all things\nits interest in unity. But how about the VARIETY in things? Is that such\nan irrelevant matter? If instead of using the term philosophy, we talk\nin general of our intellect and its needs we quickly see that unity\nis only one of these. Acquaintance with the details of fact is always\nreckoned, along with their reduction to system, as an indispensable\nmark of mental greatness. Your 'scholarly' mind, of encyclopedic,\nphilological type, your man essentially of learning, has never lacked\nfor praise along with your philosopher. What our intellect really aims\nat is neither variety nor unity taken singly but totality.[Footnote:\nCompare A. Bellanger: Les concepts de Cause, et l'activite intentionelle\nde l'Esprit. Paris, Alcan, 1905, p. 79 ff.] In this, acquaintance with\nreality's diversities is as important as understanding their connexion.\nThe human passion of curiosity runs on all fours with the systematizing\npassion.\nIn spite of this obvious fact the unity of things has always been\nconsidered more illustrious, as it were, than their variety. When a\nyoung man first conceives the notion that the whole world forms\none great fact, with all its parts moving abreast, as it were, and\ninterlocked, he feels as if he were enjoying a great insight, and looks\nsuperciliously on all who still fall short of this sublime conception.\nTaken thus abstractly as it first comes to one, the monistic insight is\nso vague as hardly to seem worth defending intellectually. Yet probably\neveryone in this audience in some way cherishes it. A certain abstract\nmonism, a certain emotional response to the character of oneness, as\nif it were a feature of the world not coordinate with its manyness, but\nvastly more excellent and eminent, is so prevalent in educated circles\nthat we might almost call it a part of philosophic common sense. Of\nCOURSE the world is one, we say. How else could it be a world at all?\nEmpiricists as a rule, are as stout monists of this abstract kind as\nrationalists are.\nThe difference is that the empiricists are less dazzled. Unity doesn't\nblind them to everything else, doesn't quench their curiosity for\nspecial facts, whereas there is a kind of rationalist who is sure to\ninterpret abstract unity mystically and to forget everything else, to\ntreat it as a principle; to admire and worship it; and thereupon to come\nto a full stop intellectually.\n'The world is One!'--the formula may become a sort of number-worship.\n'Three' and 'seven' have, it is true, been reckoned sacred numbers; but,\nabstractly taken, why is 'one' more excellent than 'forty-three,'\nor than 'two million and ten'? In this first vague conviction of the\nworld's unity, there is so little to take hold of that we hardly know\nwhat we mean by it.\nThe only way to get forward with our notion is to treat it\npragmatically. Granting the oneness to exist, what facts will be\ndifferent in consequence? What will the unity be known-as? The world is\none--yes, but HOW one? What is the practical value of the oneness for\nUS?\nAsking such questions, we pass from the vague to the definite, from the\nabstract to the concrete. Many distinct ways in which oneness predicated\nof the universe might make a difference, come to view. I will note\nsuccessively the more obvious of these ways.\n1. First, the world is at least ONE SUBJECT OF DISCOURSE. If its\nmanyness were so irremediable as to permit NO union whatever of it\nparts, not even our minds could 'mean' the whole of it at once: the\nwould be like eyes trying to look in opposite directions. But in point\nof fact we mean to cover the whole of it by our abstract term 'world' or\n'universe,' which expressly intends that no part shall be left out. Such\nunity of discourse carries obviously no farther monistic specifications.\nA 'chaos,' once so named, has as much unity of discourse as a cosmos.\nIt is an odd fact that many monists consider a great victory scored for\ntheir side when pluralists say 'the universe is many.' \"'The universe'!\"\nthey chuckle--\"his speech bewrayeth him. He stands confessed of monism\nout of his own mouth.\" Well, let things be one in that sense! You can\nthen fling such a word as universe at the whole collection of them, but\nwhat matters it? It still remains to be ascertained whether they are one\nin any other sense that is more valuable.\n2. Are they, for example, CONTINUOUS? Can you pass from one to another,\nkeeping always in your one universe without any danger of falling out?\nIn other words, do the parts of our universe HANG together, instead of\nbeing like detached grains of sand?\nEven grains of sand hang together through the space in which they are\nembedded, and if you can in any way move through such space, you can\npass continuously from number one of them to number two. Space and\ntime are thus vehicles of continuity, by which the world's parts hang\ntogether. The practical difference to us, resultant from these forms of\nunion, is immense. Our whole motor life is based upon them.\n3. There are innumerable other paths of practical continuity among\nthings. Lines of INFLUENCE can be traced by which they together.\nFollowing any such line you pass from one thing to another till you\nmay have covered a good part of the universe's extent. Gravity and\nheat-conduction are such all-uniting influences, so far as the physical\nworld goes. Electric, luminous and chemical influences follow similar\nlines of influence. But opaque and inert bodies interrupt the continuity\nhere, so that you have to step round them, or change your mode of\nprogress if you wish to get farther on that day. Practically, you have\nthen lost your universe's unity, SO FAR AS IT WAS CONSTITUTED BY THOSE\nFIRST LINES OF INFLUENCE. There are innumerable kinds of connexion that\nspecial things have with other special things; and the ENSEMBLE of any\none of these connexions forms one sort of system by which things are\nconjoined. Thus men are conjoined in a vast network of ACQUAINTANCESHIP.\nBrown knows Jones, Jones knows Robinson, etc.; and BY CHOOSING YOUR\nFARTHER INTERMEDIARIES RIGHTLY you may carry a message from Jones to the\nEmpress of China, or the Chief of the African Pigmies, or to anyone\nelse in the inhabited world. But you are stopped short, as by a\nnon-conductor, when you choose one man wrong in this experiment. What\nmay be called love-systems are grafted on the acquaintance-system. A\nloves (or hates) B; B loves (or hates) C, etc. But these systems are\nsmaller than the great acquaintance-system that they presuppose.\nHuman efforts are daily unifying the world more and more in definite\nsystematic ways. We found colonial, postal, consular, commercial\nsystems, all the parts of which obey definite influences that propagate\nthemselves within the system but not to facts outside of it. The result\nis innumerable little hangings-together of the world's parts within the\nlarger hangings-together, little worlds, not only of discourse but of\noperation, within the wider universe. Each system exemplifies one type\nor grade of union, its parts being strung on that peculiar kind of\nrelation, and the same part may figure in many different systems, as\na man may hold several offices and belong to various clubs. From this\n'systematic' point of view, therefore, the pragmatic value of the\nworld's unity is that all these definite networks actually and\npractically exist. Some are more enveloping and extensive, some less so;\nthey are superposed upon each other; and between them all they let no\nindividual elementary part of the universe escape. Enormous as is the\namount of disconnexion among things (for these systematic influences and\nconjunctions follow rigidly exclusive paths), everything that exists is\ninfluenced in SOME way by something else, if you can only pick the way\nout rightly Loosely speaking, and in general, it may be said that all\nthings cohere and adhere to each other SOMEHOW, and that the universe\nexists practically in reticulated or concatenated forms which make of\nit a continuous or 'integrated' affair. Any kind of influence whatever\nhelps to make the world one, so far as you can follow it from next\nto next. You may then say that 'the world IS One'--meaning in these\nrespects, namely, and just so far as they obtain. But just as definitely\nis it NOT one, so far as they do not obtain; and there is no species of\nconnexion which will not fail, if, instead of choosing conductors for\nit, you choose non-conductors. You are then arrested at your very\nfirst step and have to write the world down as a pure MANY from that\nparticular point of view. If our intellect had been as much interested\nin disjunctive as it is in conjunctive relations, philosophy would have\nequally successfully celebrated the world's DISUNION.\nThe great point is to notice that the oneness and the manyness are\nabsolutely co-ordinate here. Neither is primordial or more essential or\nexcellent than the other. Just as with space, whose separating of things\nseems exactly on a par with its uniting of them, but sometimes one\nfunction and sometimes the other is what come home to us most, so,\nin our general dealings with the world of influences, we now need\nconductors and now need non-conductors, and wisdom lies in knowing which\nis which at the appropriate moment.\n4. All these systems of influence or non-influence may be listed under\nthe general problem of the world's CAUSAL UNITY. If the minor causal\ninfluences among things should converge towards one common causal origin\nof them in the past, one great first cause for all that is, one might\nthen speak of the absolute causal unity of the world. God's fiat on\ncreation's day has figured in traditional philosophy as such an absolute\ncause and origin. Transcendental Idealism, translating 'creation' into\n'thinking' (or 'willing to' think') calls the divine act 'eternal'\nrather than 'first'; but the union of the many here is absolute, just\nthe same--the many would not BE, save for the One. Against this notion\nof the unity of origin of all there has always stood the pluralistic\nnotion of an eternal self-existing many in the shape of atoms or even of\nspiritual units of some sort. The alternative has doubtless a pragmatic\nmeaning, but perhaps, as far as these lectures go, we had better leave\nthe question of unity of origin unsettled.\n5. The most important sort of union that obtains among things,\npragmatically speaking, is their GENERIC UNITY. Things exist in kinds,\nthere are many specimens in each kind, and what the 'kind' implies for\none specimen, it implies also for every other specimen of that kind. We\ncan easily conceive that every fact in the world might be singular,\nthat is, unlike any other fact and sole of its kind. In such a world of\nsingulars our logic would be useless, for logic works by predicating\nof the single instance what is true of all its kind. With no two\nthings alike in the world, we should be unable to reason from our past\nexperiences to our future ones. The existence of so much generic unity\nin things is thus perhaps the most momentous pragmatic specification of\nwhat it may mean to say 'the world is One.' ABSOLUTE generic unity would\nobtain if there were one summum genus under which all things without\nexception could be eventually subsumed. 'Beings,' 'thinkables,'\n'experiences,' would be candidates for this position. Whether the\nalternatives expressed by such words have any pragmatic significance or\nnot, is another question which I prefer to leave unsettled just now.\n6. Another specification of what the phrase 'the world is One' may mean\nis UNITY OF PURPOSE. An enormous number of things in the world subserve\na common purpose. All the man-made systems, administrative, industrial,\nmilitary, or what not, exist each for its controlling purpose. Every\nliving being pursues its own peculiar purposes. They co-operate,\naccording to the degree of their development, in collective or tribal\npurposes, larger ends thus enveloping lesser ones, until an absolutely\nsingle, final and climacteric purpose subserved by all things without\nexception might conceivably be reached. It is needless to say that the\nappearances conflict with such a view. Any resultant, as I said in\nmy third lecture, MAY have been purposed in advance, but none of the\nresults we actually know in is world have in point of fact been purposed\nin advance in all their details. Men and nations start with a vague\nnotion of being rich, or great, or good. Each step they make brings\nunforeseen chances into sight, and shuts out older vistas, and the\nspecifications of the general purpose have to be daily changed. What is\nreached in the end may be better or worse than what was proposed, but it\nis always more complex and different.\nOur different purposes also are at war with each other. Where one can't\ncrush the other out, they compromise; and the result is again different\nfrom what anyone distinctly proposed beforehand. Vaguely and generally,\nmuch of what was purposed may be gained; but everything makes strongly\nfor the view that our world is incompletely unified teleologically and\nis still trying to get its unification better organized.\nWhoever claims ABSOLUTE teleological unity, saying that there is one\npurpose that every detail of the universe subserves, dogmatizes at\nhis own risk. Theologians who dogmalize thus find it more and more\nimpossible, as our acquaintance with the warring interests of the\nworld's parts grows more concrete, to imagine what the one climacteric\npurpose may possibly be like. We see indeed that certain evils minister\nto ulterior goods, that the bitter makes the cocktail better, and that\na bit of danger or hardship puts us agreeably to our trumps. We can\nvaguely generalize this into the doctrine that all the evil in the\nuniverse is but instrumental to its greater perfection. But the scale\nof the evil actually in sight defies all human tolerance; and\ntranscendental idealism, in the pages of a Bradley or a Royce, brings us\nno farther than the book of Job did--God's ways are not our ways, so let\nus put our hands upon our mouth. A God who can relish such superfluities\nof horror is no God for human beings to appeal to. His animal spirits\nare too high. In other words the 'Absolute' with his one purpose, is not\nthe man-like God of common people.\n7. AESTHETIC UNION among things also obtains, and is very analogous to\nideological union. Things tell a story. Their parts hang together so as\nto work out a climax. They play into each other's hands expressively.\nRetrospectively, we can see that altho no definite purpose presided\nover a chain of events, yet the events fell into a dramatic form, with\na start, a middle, and a finish. In point of fact all stories end; and\nhere again the point of view of a many is that more natural one to take.\nThe world is full of partial stories that run parallel to one another,\nbeginning and ending at odd times. They mutually interlace and interfere\nat points, but we cannot unify them completely in our minds. In\nfollowing your life-history, I must temporarily turn my attention from\nmy own. Even a biographer of twins would have to press them alternately\nupon his reader's attention.\nIt follows that whoever says that the whole world tells one story utters\nanother of those monistic dogmas that a man believes at his risk. It is\neasy to see the world's history pluralistically, as a rope of which each\nfibre tells a separate tale; but to conceive of each cross-section of\nthe rope as an absolutely single fact, and to sum the whole longitudinal\nseries into one being living an undivided life, is harder. We have\nindeed the analogy of embryology to help us. The microscopist makes a\nhundred flat cross-sections of a given embryo, and mentally unites them\ninto one solid whole. But the great world's ingredients, so far as\nthey are beings, seem, like the rope's fibres, to be discontinuous\ncross-wise, and to cohere only in the longitudinal direction. Followed\nin that direction they are many. Even the embryologist, when he follows\nthe DEVELOPMENT of his object, has to treat the history of each single\norgan in turn. ABSOLUTE aesthetic union is thus another barely abstract\nideal. The world appears as something more epic than dramatic.\nSo far, then, we see how the world is unified by its many systems,\nkinds, purposes, and dramas. That there is more union in all these ways\nthan openly appears is certainly true. That there MAY be one sovereign\npurpose, system, kind, and story, is a legitimate hypothesis. All I\nsay here is that it is rash to affirm this dogmatically without better\nevidence than we possess at present.\n8. The GREAT monistic DENKMITTEL for a hundred years past has been\nthe notion of THE ONE KNOWER. The many exist only as objects for his\nthought--exist in his dream, as it were; and AS HE KNOWS them, they have\none purpose, form one system, tell one tale for him. This notion of an\nALL-ENVELOPING NOETIC UNITY in things is the sublimest achievement of\nintellectualist philosophy. Those who believe in the Absolute, as the\nall-knower is termed, usually say that they do so for coercive reasons,\nwhich clear thinkers cannot evade. The Absolute has far-reaching\npractical consequences, some of which I drew attention in my second\nlecture. Many kinds of difference important to us would surely follow\nfrom its being true. I cannot here enter into all the logical proofs of\nsuch a Being's existence, farther than to say that none of them seem to\nme sound. I must therefore treat the notion of an All-Knower simply as\nan hypothesis, exactly on a par logically with the pluralist notion that\nthere is no point of view, no focus of information extant, from\nwhich the entire content of the universe is visible at once. \"God's\nconsciousness,\" says Professor Royce,[Footnote: The Conception of\nGod, New York, 1897, p. 292.] \"forms in its wholeness one luminously\ntransparent conscious moment\"--this is the type of noetic unity on which\nrationalism insists. Empiricism on the other hand is satisfied with the\ntype of noetic unity that is humanly familiar. Everything gets known by\nSOME knower along with something else; but the knowers may in the end be\nirreducibly many, and the greatest knower of them all may yet not know\nthe whole of everything, or even know what he does know at one single\nstroke:--he may be liable to forget. Whichever type obtained, the world\nwould still be a universe noetically. Its parts would be conjoined\nby knowledge, but in the one case the knowledge would be absolutely\nunified, in the other it would be strung along and overlapped.\nThe notion of one instantaneous or eternal Knower--either adjective\nhere means the same thing--is, as I said, the great intellectualist\nachievement of our time. It has practically driven out that conception\nof 'Substance' which earlier philosophers set such store by, and by\nwhich so much unifying work used to be done--universal substance which\nalone has being in and from itself, and of which all the particulars\nof experience are but forms to which it gives support. Substance has\nsuccumbed to the pragmatic criticisms of the English school. It appears\nnow only as another name for the fact that phenomena as they come are\nactually grouped and given in coherent forms, the very forms in which\nwe finite knowers experience or think them together. These forms of\nconjunction are as much parts of the tissue of experience as are the\nterms which they connect; and it is a great pragmatic achievement for\nrecent idealism to have made the world hang together in these directly\nrepresentable ways instead of drawing its unity from the 'inherence' of\nits parts--whatever that may mean--in an unimaginable principle behind\nthe scenes.\n'The world is one,' therefore, just so far as we experience it to be\nconcatenated, one by as many definite conjunctions as appear. But then\nalso NOT one by just as many definite DISjunctions as we find. The\noneness and the manyness of it thus obtain in respects which can\nbe separately named. It is neither a universe pure and simple nor\na multiverse pure and simple. And its various manners of being one\nsuggest, for their accurate ascertainment, so many distinct programs\nof scientific work. Thus the pragmatic question 'What is the oneness\nknown-as? What practical difference will it make?' saves us from all\nfeverish excitement over it as a principle of sublimity and carries us\nforward into the stream of experience with a cool head. The stream may\nindeed reveal far more connexion and union than we now suspect, but we\nare not entitled on pragmatic principles to claim absolute oneness in\nany respect in advance.\nIt is so difficult to see definitely what absolute oneness can mean,\nthat probably the majority of you are satisfied with the sober attitude\nwhich we have reached. Nevertheless there are possibly some radically\nmonistic souls among you who are not content to leave the one and the\nmany on a par. Union of various grades, union of diverse types, union\nthat stops at non-conductors, union that merely goes from next to next,\nand means in many cases outer nextness only, and not a more internal\nbond, union of concatenation, in short; all that sort of thing seems to\nyou a halfway stage of thought. The oneness of things, superior to their\nmanyness, you think must also be more deeply true, must be the more\nreal aspect of the world. The pragmatic view, you are sure, gives us\na universe imperfectly rational. The real universe must form an\nunconditional unit of being, something consolidated, with its parts\nco-implicated through and through. Only then could we consider our\nestate completely rational. There is no doubt whatever that this\nultra-monistic way of thinking means a great deal to many minds. \"One\nLife, One Truth, one Love, one Principle, One Good, One God\"--I quote\nfrom a Christian Science leaflet which the day's mail brings into my\nhands--beyond doubt such a confession of faith has pragmatically an\nemotional value, and beyond doubt the word 'one' contributes to the\nvalue quite as much as the other words. But if we try to realize\nINTELLECTUALLY what we can possibly MEAN by such a glut of oneness we\nare thrown right back upon our pragmatistic determinations again. It\nmeans either the mere name One, the universe of discourse; or it means\nthe sum total of all the ascertainable particular conjunctions and\nconcatenations; or, finally, it means some one vehicle of conjunction\ntreated as all-inclusive, like one origin, one purpose, or one knower.\nIn point of fact it always means one KNOWER to those who take it\nintellectually to-day. The one knower involves, they think, the other\nforms of conjunction. His world must have all its parts co-implicated\nin the one logical-aesthetical-teleological unit-picture which is his\neternal dream.\nThe character of the absolute knower's picture is however so impossible\nfor us to represent clearly, that we may fairly suppose that the\nauthority which absolute monism undoubtedly possesses, and probably\nalways will possess over some persons, draws its strength far less from\nintellectual than from mystical grounds. To interpret absolute monism\nworthily, be a mystic. Mystical states of mind in every degree are shown\nby history, usually tho not always, to make for the monistic view. This\nis no proper occasion to enter upon the general subject of mysticism,\nbut I will quote one mystical pronouncement to show just what I mean.\nThe paragon of all monistic systems is the Vedanta philosophy of\nHindostan, and the paragon of Vedantist missionaries was the late\nSwami Vivekananda who visited our shores some years ago. The method of\nVedantism is the mystical method. You do not reason, but after going\nthrough a certain discipline YOU SEE, and having seen, you can report\nthe truth. Vivekananda thus reports the truth in one of his lectures\nhere:\n\"Where is any more misery for him who sees this Oneness in the\nUniverse...this Oneness of life, Oneness of everything? ...This\nseparation between man and man, man and woman, man and child, nation\nfrom nation, earth from moon, moon from sun, this separation between\natom and atom is the cause really of all the misery, and the Vedanta\nsays this separation does not exist, it is not real. It is merely\napparent, on the surface. In the heart of things there is Unity still.\nIf you go inside you find that Unity between man and man, women and\nchildren, races and races, high and low, rich and poor, the gods and\nmen: all are One, and animals too, if you go deep enough, and he who has\nattained to that has no more delusion. ... Where is any more delusion\nfor him? What can delude him? He knows the reality of everything, the\nsecret of everything. Where is there any more misery for him? What does\nhe desire? He has traced the reality of everything unto the Lord, that\ncentre, that Unity of everything, and that is Eternal Bliss, Eternal\nKnowledge, Eternal Existence. Neither death nor disease, nor sorrow nor\nmisery, nor discontent is there ... in the centre, the reality, there\nis no one to be mourned for, no one to be sorry for. He has penetrated\neverything, the Pure One, the Formless, the Bodiless, the Stainless, He\nthe Knower, He the Great Poet, the Self-Existent, He who is giving to\neveryone what he deserves.\"\nObserve how radical the character of the monism here is. Separation is\nnot simply overcome by the One, it is denied to exist. There is no many.\nWe are not parts of the One; It has no parts; and since in a sense we\nundeniably ARE, it must be that each of us is the One, indivisibly and\ntotally. AN ABSOLUTE ONE, AND I THAT ONE--surely we have here a religion\nwhich, emotionally considered, has a high pragmatic value; it imparts a\nperfect sumptuosity of security. As our Swami says in another place:\n\"When man has seen himself as one with the infinite Being of the\nuniverse, when all separateness has ceased, when all men, all women, all\nangels, all gods, all animals, all plants, the whole universe has been\nmelted into that oneness, then all fear disappears. Whom to fear? Can\nI hurt myself? Can I kill myself? Can I injure myself? Do you fear\nyourself? Then will all sorrow disappear. What can cause me sorrow? I am\nthe One Existence of the universe. Then all jealousies will disappear;\nof whom to be jealous? Of myself? Then all bad feelings disappear.\nAgainst whom will I have this bad feeling? Against myself? There is none\nin the universe but me. ... Kill out this differentiation; kill out this\nsuperstition that there are many. 'He who, in this world of many, sees\nthat One; he who in this mass of insentiency sees that One Sentient\nBeing; he who in this world of shadow catches that Reality, unto him\nbelongs eternal peace, unto none else, unto none else.'\"\nWe all have some ear for this monistic music: it elevates and reassures.\nWe all have at least the germ of mysticism in us. And when our idealists\nrecite their arguments for the Absolute, saying that the slightest union\nadmitted anywhere carries logically absolute Oneness with it, and that\nthe slightest separation admitted anywhere logically carries disunion\nremediless and complete, I cannot help suspecting that the palpable weak\nplaces in the intellectual reasonings they use are protected from their\nown criticism by a mystical feeling that, logic or no logic, absolute\nOneness must somehow at any cost be true. Oneness overcomes MORAL\nseparateness at any rate. In the passion of love we have the mystic germ\nof what might mean a total union of all sentient life. This mystical\ngerm wakes up in us on hearing the monistic utterances, acknowledges\ntheir authority, and assigns to intellectual considerations a secondary\nplace.\nI will dwell no longer on these religious and moral aspects of the\nquestion in this lecture. When I come to my final lecture there will be\nsomething more to say.\nLeave then out of consideration for the moment the authority which\nmystical insights may be conjectured eventually to possess; treat the\nproblem of the One and the Many in a purely intellectual way; and we\nsee clearly enough where pragmatism stands. With her criterion of the\npractical differences that theories make, we see that she must equally\nabjure absolute monism and absolute pluralism. The world is one just\nso far as its parts hang together by any definite connexion. It is many\njust so far as any definite connexion fails to obtain. And finally it\nis growing more and more unified by those systems of connexion at least\nwhich human energy keeps framing as time goes on.\nIt is possible to imagine alternative universes to the one we know, in\nwhich the most various grades and types of union should be embodied.\nThus the lowest grade of universe would be a world of mere WITHNESS, of\nwhich the parts were only strung together by the conjunction 'and.' Such\na universe is even now the collection of our several inner lives. The\nspaces and times of your imagination, the objects and events of your\nday-dreams are not only more or less incoherent inter se, but are wholly\nout of definite relation with the similar contents of anyone else's\nmind. Our various reveries now as we sit here compenetrate each other\nidly without influencing or interfering. They coexist, but in no order\nand in no receptacle, being the nearest approach to an absolute 'many'\nthat we can conceive. We cannot even imagine any reason why they SHOULD\nbe known all together, and we can imagine even less, if they were known\ntogether, how they could be known as one systematic whole.\nBut add our sensations and bodily actions, and the union mounts to\na much higher grade. Our audita et visa and our acts fall into those\nreceptacles of time and space in which each event finds its date and\nplace. They form 'things' and are of 'kinds' too, and can be classed.\nYet we can imagine a world of things and of kinds in which the causal\ninteractions with which we are so familiar should not exist. Everything\nthere might be inert towards everything else, and refuse to propagate\nits influence. Or gross mechanical influences might pass, but no\nchemical action. Such worlds would be far less unified than ours. Again\nthere might be complete physico-chemical interaction, but no minds; or\nminds, but altogether private ones, with no social life; or social\nlife limited to acquaintance, but no love; or love, but no customs\nor institutions that should systematize it. No one of these grades of\nuniverse would be absolutely irrational or disintegrated, inferior tho\nit might appear when looked at from the higher grades. For instance, if\nour minds should ever become 'telepathically' connected, so that we knew\nimmediately, or could under certain conditions know immediately, each\nwhat the other was thinking, the world we now live in would appear to\nthe thinkers in that world to have been of an inferior grade.\nWith the whole of past eternity open for our conjectures to range in, it\nmay be lawful to wonder whether the various kinds of union now realized\nin the universe that we inhabit may not possibly have been successively\nevolved after the fashion in which we now see human systems evolving in\nconsequence of human needs. If such an hypothesis were legitimate, total\noneness would appear at the end of things rather than at their origin.\nIn other words the notion of the 'Absolute' would have to be replaced by\nthat of the 'Ultimate.' The two notions would have the same content--the\nmaximally unified content of fact, namely--but their time-relations\nwould be positively reversed. [Footnote: Compare on the Ultimate,\nMr. Schiller's essay \"Activity and Substance,\" in his book entitled\nHumanism, p. 204.]\nAfter discussing the unity of the universe in this pragmatic way, you\nought to see why I said in my second lecture, borrowing the word from my\nfriend G. Papini, that pragmatism tends to UNSTIFFEN all our theories.\nThe world's oneness has generally been affirmed abstractly only, and as\nif anyone who questioned it must be an idiot. The temper of monists has\nbeen so vehement, as almost at times to be convulsive; and this way of\nholding a doctrine does not easily go with reasonable discussion and the\ndrawing of distinctions. The theory of the Absolute, in particular, has\nhad to be an article of faith, affirmed dogmatically and exclusively.\nThe One and All, first in the order of being and of knowing, logically\nnecessary itself, and uniting all lesser things in the bonds of mutual\nnecessity, how could it allow of any mitigation of its inner\nrigidity? The slightest suspicion of pluralism, the minutest wiggle of\nindependence of any one of its parts from the control of the totality,\nwould ruin it. Absolute unity brooks no degrees--as well might you claim\nabsolute purity for a glass of water because it contains but a single\nlittle cholera-germ. The independence, however infinitesimal, of a part,\nhowever small, would be to the Absolute as fatal as a cholera-germ.\nPluralism on the other hand has no need of this dogmatic rigoristic\ntemper. Provided you grant SOME separation among things, some tremor of\nindependence, some free play of parts on one another, some real novelty\nor chance, however minute, she is amply satisfied, and will allow you\nany amount, however great, of real union. How much of union there may\nbe is a question that she thinks can only be decided empirically. The\namount may be enormous, colossal; but absolute monism is shattered if,\nalong with all the union, there has to be granted the slightest modicum,\nthe most incipient nascency, or the most residual trace, of a separation\nthat is not 'overcome.'\nPragmatism, pending the final empirical ascertainment of just what the\nbalance of union and disunion among things may be, must obviously range\nherself upon the pluralistic side. Some day, she admits, even total\nunion, with one knower, one origin, and a universe consolidated in\nevery conceivable way, may turn out to be the most acceptable of all\nhypotheses. Meanwhile the opposite hypothesis, of a world imperfectly\nunified still, and perhaps always to remain so, must be sincerely\nentertained. This latter hypothesis is pluralism's doctrine. Since\nabsolute monism forbids its being even considered seriously, branding it\nas irrational from the start, it is clear that pragmatism must turn its\nback on absolute monism, and follow pluralism's more empirical path.\nThis leaves us with the common-sense world, in which we find things\npartly joined and partly disjoined. 'Things,' then, and their\n'conjunctions'--what do such words mean, pragmatically handled? In\nmy next lecture, I will apply the pragmatic method to the stage of\nphilosophizing known as Common Sense.\nLecture V\nPragmatism and Common Sense\nIn the last lecture we turned ourselves from the usual way of talking\nof the universe's oneness as a principle, sublime in all its blankness,\ntowards a study of the special kinds of union which the universe\nenfolds. We found many of these to coexist with kinds of separation\nequally real. \"How far am I verified?\" is the question which each\nkind of union and each kind of separation asks us here, so as good\npragmatists we have to turn our face towards experience, towards\n'facts.'\nAbsolute oneness remains, but only as an hypothesis, and that hypothesis\nis reduced nowadays to that of an omniscient knower who sees all things\nwithout exception as forming one single systematic fact. But the knower\nin question may still be conceived either as an Absolute or as an\nUltimate; and over against the hypothesis of him in either form the\ncounter-hypothesis that the widest field of knowledge that ever was or\nwill be still contains some ignorance, may be legitimately held. Some\nbits of information always may escape.\nThis is the hypothesis of NOETIC PLURALISM, which monists consider so\nabsurd. Since we are bound to treat it as respectfully as noetic monism,\nuntil the facts shall have tipped the beam, we find that our pragmatism,\ntho originally nothing but a method, has forced us to be friendly to the\npluralistic view. It MAY be that some parts of the world are connected\nso loosely with some other parts as to be strung along by nothing but\nthe copula AND. They might even come and go without those other parts\nsuffering any internal change. This pluralistic view, of a world of\nADDITIVE constitution, is one that pragmatism is unable to rule out from\nserious consideration. But this view leads one to the farther hypothesis\nthat the actual world, instead of being complete 'eternally,' as the\nmonists assure us, may be eternally incomplete, and at all times subject\nto addition or liable to loss.\nIt IS at any rate incomplete in one respect, and flagrantly so. The very\nfact that we debate this question shows that our KNOWLEDGE is incomplete\nat present and subject to addition. In respect of the knowledge it\ncontains the world does genuinely change and grow. Some general remarks\non the way in which our knowledge completes itself--when it does\ncomplete itself--will lead us very conveniently into our subject for\nthis lecture, which is 'Common Sense.'\nTo begin with, our knowledge grows IN SPOTS. The spots may be large or\nsmall, but the knowledge never grows all over: some old knowledge always\nremains what it was. Your knowledge of pragmatism, let us suppose, is\ngrowing now. Later, its growth may involve considerable modification of\nopinions which you previously held to be true. But such modifications\nare apt to be gradual. To take the nearest possible example, consider\nthese lectures of mine. What you first gain from them is probably a\nsmall amount of new information, a few new definitions, or distinctions,\nor points of view. But while these special ideas are being added, the\nrest of your knowledge stands still, and only gradually will you 'line\nup' your previous opinions with the novelties I am trying to instil, and\nmodify to some slight degree their mass.\nYou listen to me now, I suppose, with certain prepossessions as to my\ncompetency, and these affect your reception of what I say, but were I\nsuddenly to break off lecturing, and to begin to sing 'We won't go home\ntill morning' in a rich baritone voice, not only would that new fact be\nadded to your stock, but it would oblige you to define me differently,\nand that might alter your opinion of the pragmatic philosophy, and in\ngeneral bring about a rearrangement of a number of your ideas. Your mind\nin such processes is strained, and sometimes painfully so, between its\nolder beliefs and the novelties which experience brings along.\nOur minds thus grow in spots; and like grease-spots, the spots spread.\nBut we let them spread as little as possible: we keep unaltered as much\nof our old knowledge, as many of our old prejudices and beliefs, as we\ncan. We patch and tinker more than we renew. The novelty soaks in; it\nstains the ancient mass; but it is also tinged by what absorbs it. Our\npast apperceives and co-operates; and in the new equilibrium in which\neach step forward in the process of learning terminates, it happens\nrelatively seldom that the new fact is added RAW. More usually it is\nembedded cooked, as one might say, or stewed down in the sauce of the\nold.\nNew truths thus are resultants of new experiences and of old truths\ncombined and mutually modifying one another. And since this is the case\nin the changes of opinion of to-day, there is no reason to assume that\nit has not been so at all times. It follows that very ancient modes\nof thought may have survived through all the later changes in men's\nopinions. The most primitive ways of thinking may not yet be wholly\nexpunged. Like our five fingers, our ear-bones, our rudimentary caudal\nappendage, or our other 'vestigial' peculiarities, they may remain as\nindelible tokens of events in our race-history. Our ancestors may at\ncertain moments have struck into ways of thinking which they might\nconceivably not have found. But once they did so, and after the fact,\nthe inheritance continues. When you begin a piece of music in a certain\nkey, you must keep the key to the end. You may alter your house ad\nlibitum, but the ground-plan of the first architect persists--you can\nmake great changes, but you cannot change a Gothic church into a Doric\ntemple. You may rinse and rinse the bottle, but you can't get the taste\nof the medicine or whiskey that first filled it wholly out.\nMy thesis now is this, that OUR FUNDAMENTAL WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT\nTHINGS ARE DISCOVERIES OF EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE ANCESTORS, WHICH HAVE BEEN\nABLE TO PRESERVE THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL SUBSEQUENT\nTIME. They form one great stage of equilibrium in the human mind's\ndevelopment, the stage of common sense. Other stages have grafted\nthemselves upon this stage, but have never succeeded in displacing it.\nLet us consider this common-sense stage first, as if it might be final.\nIn practical talk, a man's common sense means his good judgment, his\nfreedom from excentricity, his GUMPTION, to use the vernacular word. In\nphilosophy it means something entirely different, it means his use of\ncertain intellectual forms or categories of thought. Were we lobsters,\nor bees, it might be that our organization would have led to our using\nquite different modes from these of apprehending our experiences. It\nMIGHT be too (we cannot dogmatically deny this) that such categories,\nunimaginable by us to-day, would have proved on the whole as serviceable\nfor handling our experiences mentally as those which we actually use.\nIf this sounds paradoxical to anyone, let him think of analytical\ngeometry. The identical figures which Euclid defined by intrinsic\nrelations were defined by Descartes by the relations of their points to\nadventitious co-ordinates, the result being an absolutely different and\nvastly more potent way of handling curves. All our conceptions are what\nthe Germans call denkmittel, means by which we handle facts by thinking\nthem. Experience merely as such doesn't come ticketed and labeled, we\nhave first to discover what it is. Kant speaks of it as being in\nits first intention a gewuehl der erscheinungen, a rhapsodie der\nwahrnehmungen, a mere motley which we have to unify by our wits. What\nwe usually do is first to frame some system of concepts mentally\nclassified, serialized, or connected in some intellectual way, and then\nto use this as a tally by which we 'keep tab' on the impressions that\npresent themselves. When each is referred to some possible place in the\nconceptual system, it is thereby 'understood.' This notion of parallel\n'manifolds' with their elements standing reciprocally in 'one-to-one\nrelations,' is proving so convenient nowadays in mathematics and logic\nas to supersede more and more the older classificatory conceptions.\nThere are many conceptual systems of this sort; and the sense\nmanifold is also such a system. Find a one-to-one relation for your\nsense-impressions ANYWHERE among the concepts, and in so far forth you\nrationalize the impressions. But obviously you can rationalize them by\nusing various conceptual systems.\nThe old common-sense way of rationalizing them is by a set of concepts\nof which the most important are these:\nThing;\nThe same or different;\nKinds;\nMinds;\nBodies;\nOne Time;\nOne Space;\nSubjects and attributes;\nCausal influences;\nThe fancied;\nThe real.\nWe are now so familiar with the order that these notions have woven for\nus out of the everlasting weather of our perceptions that we find it\nhard to realize how little of a fixed routine the perceptions follow\nwhen taken by themselves. The word weather is a good one to use here.\nIn Boston, for example, the weather has almost no routine, the only law\nbeing that if you have had any weather for two days, you will probably\nbut not certainly have another weather on the third. Weather-experience\nas it thus comes to Boston, is discontinuous and chaotic. In point of\ntemperature, of wind, rain or sunshine, it MAY change three times a\nday. But the Washington weather-bureau intellectualizes this disorder by\nmaking each successive bit of Boston weather EPISODIC. It refers it to\nits place and moment in a continental cyclone, on the history of which\nthe local changes everywhere are strung as beads are strung upon a cord.\nNow it seems almost certain that young children and the inferior animals\ntake all their experiences very much as uninstructed Bostonians take\ntheir weather. They know no more of time or space as world-receptacles,\nor of permanent subjects and changing predicates, or of causes,\nor kinds, or thoughts, or things, than our common people know of\ncontinental cyclones. A baby's rattle drops out of his hand, but the\nbaby looks not for it. It has 'gone out' for him, as a candle-flame goes\nout; and it comes back, when you replace it in his hand, as the flame\ncomes back when relit. The idea of its being a 'thing,' whose permanent\nexistence by itself he might interpolate between its successive\napparitions has evidently not occurred to him. It is the same with dogs.\nOut of sight, out of mind, with them. It is pretty evident that they\nhave no GENERAL tendency to interpolate 'things.' Let me quote here a\npassage from my colleague G. Santayana's book.\n\"If a dog, while sniffing about contentedly, sees afar off his master\narriving after long absence...the poor brute asks for no reason why\nhis master went, why he has come again, why he should be loved, or why\npresently while lying at his feet you forget him and begin to grunt and\ndream of the chase--all that is an utter mystery, utterly unconsidered.\nSuch experience has variety, scenery, and a certain vital rhythm;\nits story might be told in dithyrambic verse. It moves wholly by\ninspiration; every event is providential, every act unpremeditated.\nAbsolute freedom and absolute helplessness have met together: you\ndepend wholly on divine favour, yet that unfathomable agency is not\ndistinguishable from your own life. ...[But] the figures even of that\ndisordered drama have their exits and their entrances; and their cues\ncan be gradually discovered by a being capable of fixing his\nattention and retaining the order of events. ...In proportion as such\nunderstanding advances each moment of experience becomes consequential\nand prophetic of the rest. The calm places in life are filled with power\nand its spasms with resource. No emotion can overwhelm the mind, for\nof none is the basis or issue wholly hidden; no event can disconcert it\naltogether, because it sees beyond. Means can be looked for to escape\nfrom the worst predicament; and whereas each moment had been formerly\nfilled with nothing but its own adventure and surprised emotion, each\nnow makes room for the lesson of what went before and surmises what\nmay be the plot of the whole.\"[Footnote: The Life of Reason: Reason in\nCommon Sense, 1905, p. 59.]\nEven to-day science and philosophy are still laboriously trying to part\nfancies from realities in our experience; and in primitive times they\nmade only the most incipient distinctions in this line. Men believed\nwhatever they thought with any liveliness, and they mixed their dreams\nwith their realities inextricably. The categories of 'thought' and\n'things' are indispensable here--instead of being realities we now call\ncertain experiences only 'thoughts.' There is not a category, among\nthose enumerated, of which we may not imagine the use to have thus\noriginated historically and only gradually spread.\nThat one Time which we all believe in and in which each event has its\ndefinite date, that one Space in which each thing has its position,\nthese abstract notions unify the world incomparably; but in their\nfinished shape as concepts how different they are from the loose\nunordered time-and-space experiences of natural men! Everything that\nhappens to us brings its own duration and extension, and both are\nvaguely surrounded by a marginal 'more' that runs into the duration\nand extension of the next thing that comes. But we soon lose all our\ndefinite bearings; and not only do our children make no distinction\nbetween yesterday and the day before yesterday, the whole past being\nchurned up together, but we adults still do so whenever the times are\nlarge. It is the same with spaces. On a map I can distinctly see the\nrelation of London, Constantinople, and Pekin to the place where I am;\nin reality I utterly fail to FEEL the facts which the map symbolizes.\nThe directions and distances are vague, confused and mixed. Cosmic space\nand cosmic time, so far from being the intuitions that Kant said they\nwere, are constructions as patently artificial as any that science can\nshow. The great majority of the human race never use these notions, but\nlive in plural times and spaces, interpenetrant and DURCHEINANDER.\nPermanent 'things' again; the 'same' thing and its various 'appearances'\nand 'alterations'; the different 'kinds' of thing; with the 'kind' used\nfinally as a 'predicate,' of which the thing remains the 'subject'--what\na straightening of the tangle of our experience's immediate flux and\nsensible variety does this list of terms suggest! And it is only\nthe smallest part of his experience's flux that anyone actually does\nstraighten out by applying to it these conceptual instruments. Out of\nthem all our lowest ancestors probably used only, and then most vaguely\nand inaccurately, the notion of 'the same again.' But even then if\nyou had asked them whether the same were a 'thing' that had endured\nthroughout the unseen interval, they would probably have been at a\nloss, and would have said that they had never asked that question, or\nconsidered matters in that light.\nKinds, and sameness of kind--what colossally useful DENKMITTEL for\nfinding our way among the many! The manyness might conceivably have\nbeen absolute. Experiences might have all been singulars, no one of them\noccurring twice. In such a world logic would have had no application;\nfor kind and sameness of kind are logic's only instruments. Once we know\nthat whatever is of a kind is also of that kind's kind, we can travel\nthrough the universe as if with seven-league boots. Brutes surely never\nuse these abstractions, and civilized men use them in most various\namounts.\nCausal influence, again! This, if anything, seems to have been an\nantediluvian conception; for we find primitive men thinking that almost\neverything is significant and can exert influence of some sort. The\nsearch for the more definite influences seems to have started in the\nquestion: \"Who, or what, is to blame?\"--for any illness, namely, or\ndisaster, or untoward thing. From this centre the search for causal\ninfluences has spread. Hume and 'Science' together have tried to\neliminate the whole notion of influence, substituting the entirely\ndifferent DENKMITTEL of 'law.' But law is a comparatively recent\ninvention, and influence reigns supreme in the older realm of common\nsense.\nThe 'possible,' as something less than the actual and more than the\nwholly unreal, is another of these magisterial notions of common sense.\nCriticize them as you may, they persist; and we fly back to them the\nmoment critical pressure is relaxed. 'Self,' 'body,' in the substantial\nor metaphysical sense--no one escapes subjection to THOSE forms\nof thought. In practice, the common-sense DENKMITTEL are uniformly\nvictorious. Everyone, however instructed, still thinks of a 'thing' in\nthe common-sense way, as a permanent unit-subject that 'supports' its\nattributes interchangeably. No one stably or sincerely uses the more\ncritical notion, of a group of sense-qualities united by a law. With\nthese categories in our hand, we make our plans and plot together, and\nconnect all the remoter parts of experience with what lies before our\neyes. Our later and more critical philosophies are mere fads and fancies\ncompared with this natural mother-tongue of thought.\nCommon sense appears thus as a perfectly definite stage in our\nunderstanding of things, a stage that satisfies in an extraordinarily\nsuccessful way the purposes for which we think. 'Things' do exist, even\nwhen we do not see them. Their 'kinds' also exist. Their 'qualities' are\nwhat they act by, and are what we act on; and these also exist. These\nlamps shed their quality of light on every object in this room. We\nintercept IT on its way whenever we hold up an opaque screen. It is\nthe very sound that my lips emit that travels into your ears. It is the\nsensible heat of the fire that migrates into the water in which we boil\nan egg; and we can change the heat into coolness by dropping in a\nlump of ice. At this stage of philosophy all non-European men without\nexception have remained. It suffices for all the necessary practical\nends of life; and, among our own race even, it is only the highly\nsophisticated specimens, the minds debauched by learning, as Berkeley\ncalls them, who have ever even suspected common sense of not being\nabsolutely true.\nBut when we look back, and speculate as to how the common-sense\ncategories may have achieved their wonderful supremacy, no reason\nappears why it may not have been by a process just like that by which\nthe conceptions due to Democritus, Berkeley, or Darwin, achieved their\nsimilar triumphs in more recent times. In other words, they may have\nbeen successfully DISCOVERED by prehistoric geniuses whose names the\nnight of antiquity has covered up; they may have been verified by the\nimmediate facts of experience which they first fitted; and then from\nfact to fact and from man to man they may have SPREAD, until all\nlanguage rested on them and we are now incapable of thinking naturally\nin any other terms. Such a view would only follow the rule that has\nproved elsewhere so fertile, of assuming the vast and remote to conform\nto the laws of formation that we can observe at work in the small and\nnear.\nFor all utilitarian practical purposes these conceptions amply suffice;\nbut that they began at special points of discovery and only gradually\nspread from one thing to another, seems proved by the exceedingly\ndubious limits of their application to-day. We assume for certain\npurposes one 'objective' Time that AEQUABILITER FLUIT, but we don't\nlivingly believe in or realize any such equally-flowing time. 'Space'\nis a less vague notion; but 'things,' what are they? Is a constellation\nproperly a thing? or an army? or is an ENS RATIONIS such as space or\njustice a thing? Is a knife whose handle and blade are changed the\n'same'? Is the 'changeling,' whom Locke so seriously discusses, of the\nhuman 'kind'? Is 'telepathy' a 'fancy' or a 'fact'? The moment you pass\nbeyond the practical use of these categories (a use usually suggested\nsufficiently by the circumstances of the special case) to a merely\ncurious or speculative way of thinking, you find it impossible to say\nwithin just what limits of fact any one of them shall apply.\nThe peripatetic philosophy, obeying rationalist propensities, has\ntried to eternalize the common-sense categories by treating them very\ntechnically and articulately. A 'thing' for instance is a being, or\nENS. An ENS is a subject in which qualities 'inhere.' A subject is a\nsubstance. Substances are of kinds, and kinds are definite in number,\nand discrete. These distinctions are fundamental and eternal. As terms\nof DISCOURSE they are indeed magnificently useful, but what they mean,\napart from their use in steering our discourse to profitable issues,\ndoes not appear. If you ask a scholastic philosopher what a substance\nmay be in itself, apart from its being the support of attributes, he\nsimply says that your intellect knows perfectly what the word means.\nBut what the intellect knows clearly is only the word itself and its\nsteering function. So it comes about that intellects SIBI PERMISSI,\nintellects only curious and idle, have forsaken the common-sense level\nfor what in general terms may be called the 'critical' level of thought.\nNot merely SUCH intellects either--your Humes and Berkeleys and Hegels;\nbut practical observers of facts, your Galileos, Daltons, Faradays, have\nfound it impossible to treat the NAIFS sense-termini of common sense\nas ultimately real. As common sense interpolates her constant 'things'\nbetween our intermittent sensations, so science EXTRApolates her world\nof 'primary' qualities, her atoms, her ether, her magnetic fields, and\nthe like, beyond the common-sense world. The 'things' are now invisible\nimpalpable things; and the old visible common-sense things are supposed\nto result from the mixture of these invisibles. Or else the whole NAIF\nconception of thing gets superseded, and a thing's name is interpreted\nas denoting only the law or REGEL DER VERBINDUNG by which certain of our\nsensations habitually succeed or coexist.\nScience and critical philosophy thus burst the bounds of common sense.\nWith science NAIF realism ceases: 'Secondary' qualities become unreal;\nprimary ones alone remain. With critical philosophy, havoc is made of\neverything. The common-sense categories one and all cease to represent\nanything in the way of BEING; they are but sublime tricks of human\nthought, our ways of escaping bewilderment in the midst of sensation's\nirremediable flow.\nBut the scientific tendency in critical thought, tho inspired at first\nby purely intellectual motives, has opened an entirely unexpected range\nof practical utilities to our astonished view. Galileo gave us accurate\nclocks and accurate artillery-practice; the chemists flood us with new\nmedicines and dye-stuffs; Ampere and Faraday have endowed us with the\nNew York subway and with Marconi telegrams. The hypothetical things that\nsuch men have invented, defined as they have defined them, are showing\nan extraordinary fertility in consequences verifiable by sense. Our\nlogic can deduce from them a consequence due under certain conditions,\nwe can then bring about the conditions, and presto, the consequence\nis there before our eyes. The scope of the practical control of nature\nnewly put into our hand by scientific ways of thinking vastly exceeds\nthe scope of the old control grounded on common sense. Its rate of\nincrease accelerates so that no one can trace the limit; one may even\nfear that the BEING of man may be crushed by his own powers, that his\nfixed nature as an organism may not prove adequate to stand the strain\nof the ever increasingly tremendous functions, almost divine creative\nfunctions, which his intellect will more and more enable him to wield.\nHe may drown in his wealth like a child in a bath-tub, who has turned on\nthe water and who cannot turn it off.\nThe philosophic stage of criticism, much more thorough in its negations\nthan the scientific stage, so far gives us no new range of practical\npower. Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, have all been utterly\nsterile, so far as shedding any light on the details of nature goes, and\nI can think of no invention or discovery that can be directly traced\nto anything in their peculiar thought, for neither with Berkeley's\ntar-water nor with Kant's nebular hypothesis had their respective\nphilosophic tenets anything to do. The satisfactions they yield to their\ndisciples are intellectual, not practical; and even then we have to\nconfess that there is a large minus-side to the account.\nThere are thus at least three well-characterized levels, stages or types\nof thought about the world we live in, and the notions of one stage\nhave one kind of merit, those of another stage another kind. It is\nimpossible, however, to say that any stage as yet in sight is absolutely\nmore TRUE than any other. Common sense is the more CONSOLIDATED stage,\nbecause it got its innings first, and made all language into its ally.\nWhether it or science be the more AUGUST stage may be left to private\njudgment. But neither consolidation nor augustness are decisive marks of\ntruth. If common sense were true, why should science have had to\nbrand the secondary qualities, to which our world owes all its living\ninterest, as false, and to invent an invisible world of points and\ncurves and mathematical equations instead? Why should it have needed\nto transform causes and activities into laws of 'functional variation'?\nVainly did scholasticism, common sense's college-trained younger sister,\nseek to stereotype the forms the human family had always talked with,\nto make them definite and fix them for eternity. Substantial forms (in\nother words our secondary qualities) hardly outlasted the year of our\nLord 1600. People were already tired of them then; and Galileo, and\nDescartes, with his 'new philosophy,' gave them only a little later\ntheir coup de grace.\nBut now if the new kinds of scientific 'thing,' the corpuscular and\netheric world, were essentially more 'true,' why should they have\nexcited so much criticism within the body of science itself? Scientific\nlogicians are saying on every hand that these entities and their\ndeterminations, however definitely conceived, should not be held for\nliterally real. It is AS IF they existed; but in reality they are like\nco-ordinates or logarithms, only artificial short-cuts for taking us\nfrom one part to another of experience's flux. We can cipher fruitfully\nwith them; they serve us wonderfully; but we must not be their dupes.\nThere is no RINGING conclusion possible when we compare these types\nof thinking, with a view to telling which is the more absolutely true.\nTheir naturalness, their intellectual economy, their fruitfulness for\npractice, all start up as distinct tests of their veracity, and as a\nresult we get confused. Common sense is BETTER for one sphere of life,\nscience for another, philosophic criticism for a third; but whether\neither be TRUER absolutely, Heaven only knows. Just now, if I understand\nthe matter rightly, we are witnessing a curious reversion to the\ncommon-sense way of looking at physical nature, in the philosophy of\nscience favored by such men as Mach, Ostwald and Duhem. According to\nthese teachers no hypothesis is truer than any other in the sense of\nbeing a more literal copy of reality. They are all but ways of talking\non our part, to be compared solely from the point of view of their USE.\nThe only literally true thing is REALITY; and the only reality we know\nis, for these logicians, sensible reality, the flux of our sensations\nand emotions as they pass. 'Energy' is the collective name (according\nto Ostwald) for the sensations just as they present themselves (the\nmovement, heat, magnetic pull, or light, or whatever it may be) when\nthey are measured in certain ways. So measuring them, we are enabled\nto describe the correlated changes which they show us, in formulas\nmatchless for their simplicity and fruitfulness for human use. They are\nsovereign triumphs of economy in thought.\nNo one can fail to admire the 'energetic' philosophy. But the\nhypersensible entities, the corpuscles and vibrations, hold their own\nwith most physicists and chemists, in spite of its appeal. It seems too\neconomical to be all-sufficient. Profusion, not economy, may after all\nbe reality's key-note.\nI am dealing here with highly technical matters, hardly suitable for\npopular lecturing, and in which my own competence is small. All the\nbetter for my conclusion, however, which at this point is this. The\nwhole notion of truth, which naturally and without reflexion we assume\nto mean the simple duplication by the mind of a ready-made and given\nreality, proves hard to understand clearly. There is no simple test\navailable for adjudicating offhand between the divers types of thought\nthat claim to possess it. Common sense, common science or corpuscular\nphilosophy, ultra-critical science, or energetics, and critical or\nidealistic philosophy, all seem insufficiently true in some regard and\nleave some dissatisfaction. It is evident that the conflict of these so\nwidely differing systems obliges us to overhaul the very idea of truth,\nfor at present we have no definite notion of what the word may mean. I\nshall face that task in my next lecture, and will add but a few words,\nin finishing the present one.\nThere are only two points that I wish you to retain from the present\nlecture. The first one relates to common sense. We have seen reason to\nsuspect it, to suspect that in spite of their being so venerable, of\ntheir being so universally used and built into the very structure\nof language, its categories may after all be only a collection of\nextraordinarily successful hypotheses (historically discovered or\ninvented by single men, but gradually communicated, and used by\neverybody) by which our forefathers have from time immemorial unified\nand straightened the discontinuity of their immediate experiences,\nand put themselves into an equilibrium with the surface of nature so\nsatisfactory for ordinary practical purposes that it certainly would\nhave lasted forever, but for the excessive intellectual vivacity of\nDemocritus, Archimedes, Galileo, Berkeley, and other excentric geniuses\nwhom the example of such men inflamed. Retain, I pray you, this\nsuspicion about common sense.\nThe other point is this. Ought not the existence of the various types of\nthinking which we have reviewed, each so splendid for certain purposes,\nyet all conflicting still, and neither one of them able to support a\nclaim of absolute veracity, to awaken a presumption favorable to the\npragmatistic view that all our theories are INSTRUMENTAL, are mental\nmodes of ADAPTATION to reality, rather than revelations or gnostic\nanswers to some divinely instituted world-enigma? I expressed this view\nas clearly as I could in the second of these lectures. Certainly the\nrestlessness of the actual theoretic situation, the value for some\npurposes of each thought-level, and the inability of either to expel the\nothers decisively, suggest this pragmatistic view, which I hope that the\nnext lectures may soon make entirely convincing. May there not after all\nbe a possible ambiguity in truth?\nLecture VI\nPragmatism's Conception of Truth\nWhen Clerk Maxwell was a child it is written that he had a mania for\nhaving everything explained to him, and that when people put him off\nwith vague verbal accounts of any phenomenon he would interrupt them\nimpatiently by saying, \"Yes; but I want you to tell me the PARTICULAR GO\nof it!\" Had his question been about truth, only a pragmatist could\nhave told him the particular go of it. I believe that our contemporary\npragmatists, especially Messrs. Schiller and Dewey, have given the only\ntenable account of this subject. It is a very ticklish subject, sending\nsubtle rootlets into all kinds of crannies, and hard to treat in the\nsketchy way that alone befits a public lecture. But the Schiller-Dewey\nview of truth has been so ferociously attacked by rationalistic\nphilosophers, and so abominably misunderstood, that here, if anywhere,\nis the point where a clear and simple statement should be made.\nI fully expect to see the pragmatist view of truth run through the\nclassic stages of a theory's career. First, you know, a new theory is\nattacked as absurd; then it is admitted to be true, but obvious\nand insignificant; finally it is seen to be so important that its\nadversaries claim that they themselves discovered it. Our doctrine of\ntruth is at present in the first of these three stages, with symptoms\nof the second stage having begun in certain quarters. I wish that this\nlecture might help it beyond the first stage in the eyes of many of you.\nTruth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our\nideas. It means their 'agreement,' as falsity means their disagreement,\nwith 'reality.' Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this\ndefinition as a matter of course. They begin to quarrel only after\nthe question is raised as to what may precisely be meant by the term\n'agreement,' and what by the term 'reality,' when reality is taken as\nsomething for our ideas to agree with.\nIn answering these questions the pragmatists are more analytic and\npainstaking, the intellectualists more offhand and irreflective. The\npopular notion is that a true idea must copy its reality. Like\nother popular views, this one follows the analogy of the most usual\nexperience. Our true ideas of sensible things do indeed copy them. Shut\nyour eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get just such\na true picture or copy of its dial. But your idea of its 'works' (unless\nyou are a clock-maker) is much less of a copy, yet it passes muster, for\nit in no way clashes with the reality. Even tho it should shrink to the\nmere word 'works,' that word still serves you truly; and when you\nspeak of the 'time-keeping function' of the clock, or of its spring's\n'elasticity,' it is hard to see exactly what your ideas can copy.\nYou perceive that there is a problem here. Where our ideas cannot copy\ndefinitely their object, what does agreement with that object mean?\nSome idealists seem to say that they are true whenever they are what\nGod means that we ought to think about that object. Others hold the\ncopy-view all through, and speak as if our ideas possessed truth just\nin proportion as they approach to being copies of the Absolute's eternal\nway of thinking.\nThese views, you see, invite pragmatistic discussion. But the great\nassumption of the intellectualists is that truth means essentially\nan inert static relation. When you've got your true idea of anything,\nthere's an end of the matter. You're in possession; you KNOW; you have\nfulfilled your thinking destiny. You are where you ought to be mentally;\nyou have obeyed your categorical imperative; and nothing more need\nfollow on that climax of your rational destiny. Epistemologically you\nare in stable equilibrium.\nPragmatism, on the other hand, asks its usual question. \"Grant an idea\nor belief to be true,\" it says, \"what concrete difference will its being\ntrue make in anyone's actual life? How will the truth be realized?\nWhat experiences will be different from those which would obtain if\nthe belief were false? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in\nexperiential terms?\"\nThe moment pragmatism asks this question, it sees the answer: TRUE IDEAS\nARE THOSE THAT WE CAN ASSIMILATE, VALIDATE, CORROBORATE AND VERIFY.\nFALSE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CANNOT. That is the practical difference\nit makes to us to have true ideas; that, therefore, is the meaning of\ntruth, for it is all that truth is known-as.\nThis thesis is what I have to defend. The truth of an idea is not a\nstagnant property inherent in it. Truth HAPPENS to an idea. It BECOMES\ntrue, is MADE true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process:\nthe process namely of its verifying itself, its veri-FICATION. Its\nvalidity is the process of its valid-ATION.\nBut what do the words verification and validation themselves\npragmatically mean? They again signify certain practical consequences of\nthe verified and validated idea. It is hard to find any one phrase\nthat characterizes these consequences better than the ordinary\nagreement-formula--just such consequences being what we have in mind\nwhenever we say that our ideas 'agree' with reality. They lead us,\nnamely, through the acts and other ideas which they instigate, into or\nup to, or towards, other parts of experience with which we feel all the\nwhile-such feeling being among our potentialities--that the original\nideas remain in agreement. The connexions and transitions come to us\nfrom point to point as being progressive, harmonious, satisfactory. This\nfunction of agreeable leading is what we mean by an idea's verification.\nSuch an account is vague and it sounds at first quite trivial, but it\nhas results which it will take the rest of my hour to explain.\nLet me begin by reminding you of the fact that the possession of true\nthoughts means everywhere the possession of invaluable instruments\nof action; and that our duty to gain truth, so far from being a\nblank command from out of the blue, or a 'stunt' self-imposed by our\nintellect, can account for itself by excellent practical reasons.\nThe importance to human life of having true beliefs about matters of\nfact is a thing too notorious. We live in a world of realities that can\nbe infinitely useful or infinitely harmful. Ideas that tell us which\nof them to expect count as the true ideas in all this primary sphere of\nverification, and the pursuit of such ideas is a primary human duty. The\npossession of truth, so far from being here an end in itself, is only a\npreliminary means towards other vital satisfactions. If I am lost in\nthe woods and starved, and find what looks like a cow-path, it is of the\nutmost importance that I should think of a human habitation at the end\nof it, for if I do so and follow it, I save myself. The true thought\nis useful here because the house which is its object is useful. The\npractical value of true ideas is thus primarily derived from the\npractical importance of their objects to us. Their objects are, indeed,\nnot important at all times. I may on another occasion have no use\nfor the house; and then my idea of it, however verifiable, will be\npractically irrelevant, and had better remain latent. Yet since almost\nany object may some day become temporarily important, the advantage of\nhaving a general stock of extra truths, of ideas that shall be true of\nmerely possible situations, is obvious. We store such extra truths away\nin our memories, and with the overflow we fill our books of reference.\nWhenever such an extra truth becomes practically relevant to one of our\nemergencies, it passes from cold-storage to do work in the world, and\nour belief in it grows active. You can say of it then either that 'it\nis useful because it is true' or that 'it is true because it is useful.'\nBoth these phrases mean exactly the same thing, namely that here is\nan idea that gets fulfilled and can be verified. True is the name for\nwhatever idea starts the verification-process, useful is the name for\nits completed function in experience. True ideas would never have been\nsingled out as such, would never have acquired a class-name, least of\nall a name suggesting value, unless they had been useful from the outset\nin this way.\nFrom this simple cue pragmatism gets her general notion of truth as\nsomething essentially bound up with the way in which one moment in our\nexperience may lead us towards other moments which it will be worth\nwhile to have been led to. Primarily, and on the common-sense level, the\ntruth of a state of mind means this function of A LEADING THAT IS WORTH\nWHILE. When a moment in our experience, of any kind whatever, inspires\nus with a thought that is true, that means that sooner or later we dip\nby that thought's guidance into the particulars of experience again and\nmake advantageous connexion with them. This is a vague enough statement,\nbut I beg you to retain it, for it is essential.\nOur experience meanwhile is all shot through with regularities. One\nbit of it can warn us to get ready for another bit, can 'intend' or\nbe 'significant of' that remoter object. The object's advent is the\nsignificance's verification. Truth, in these cases, meaning nothing but\neventual verification, is manifestly incompatible with waywardness on\nour part. Woe to him whose beliefs play fast and loose with the order\nwhich realities follow in his experience: they will lead him nowhere or\nelse make false connexions.\nBy 'realities' or 'objects' here, we mean either things of common sense,\nsensibly present, or else common-sense relations, such as dates, places,\ndistances, kinds, activities. Following our mental image of a house\nalong the cow-path, we actually come to see the house; we get the\nimage's full verification. SUCH SIMPLY AND FULLY VERIFIED LEADINGS ARE\nCERTAINLY THE ORIGINALS AND PROTOTYPES OF THE TRUTH-PROCESS. Experience\noffers indeed other forms of truth-process, but they are all conceivable\nas being primary verifications arrested, multiplied or substituted one\nfor another.\nTake, for instance, yonder object on the wall. You and I consider it to\nbe a 'clock,' altho no one of us has seen the hidden works that make it\none. We let our notion pass for true without attempting to verify. If\ntruths mean verification-process essentially, ought we then to call such\nunverified truths as this abortive? No, for they form the overwhelmingly\nlarge number of the truths we live by. Indirect as well as direct\nverifications pass muster. Where circumstantial evidence is sufficient,\nwe can go without eye-witnessing. Just as we here assume Japan to exist\nwithout ever having been there, because it WORKS to do so, everything we\nknow conspiring with the belief, and nothing interfering, so we assume\nthat thing to be a clock. We USE it as a clock, regulating the length\nof our lecture by it. The verification of the assumption here means its\nleading to no frustration or contradiction. VerifiABILITY of wheels and\nweights and pendulum is as good as verification. For one truth-process\ncompleted there are a million in our lives that function in this state\nof nascency. They turn us TOWARDS direct verification; lead us into the\nSURROUNDINGS of the objects they envisage; and then, if everything runs\non harmoniously, we are so sure that verification is possible that we\nomit it, and are usually justified by all that happens.\nTruth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system. Our\nthoughts and beliefs 'pass,' so long as nothing challenges them, just as\nbank-notes pass so long as nobody refuses them. But this all points to\ndirect face-to-face verifications somewhere, without which the fabric of\ntruth collapses like a financial system with no cash-basis whatever.\nYou accept my verification of one thing, I yours of another. We trade on\neach other's truth. But beliefs verified concretely by SOMEBODY are the\nposts of the whole superstructure.\nAnother great reason--beside economy of time--for waiving complete\nverification in the usual business of life is that all things exist\nin kinds and not singly. Our world is found once for all to have that\npeculiarity. So that when we have once directly verified our ideas about\none specimen of a kind, we consider ourselves free to apply them to\nother specimens without verification. A mind that habitually\ndiscerns the kind of thing before it, and acts by the law of the\nkind immediately, without pausing to verify, will be a 'true' mind\nin ninety-nine out of a hundred emergencies, proved so by its conduct\nfitting everything it meets, and getting no refutation.\nINDIRECTLY OR ONLY POTENTIALLY VERIFYING PROCESSES MAY THUS BE TRUE AS\nWELL AS FULL VERIFICATION-PROCESSES. They work as true processes would\nwork, give us the same advantages, and claim our recognition for the\nsame reasons. All this on the common-sense level of, matters of fact,\nwhich we are alone considering.\nBut matters of fact are not our only stock in trade. RELATIONS AMONG\nPURELY MENTAL IDEAS form another sphere where true and false beliefs\nobtain, and here the beliefs are absolute, or unconditional. When they\nare true they bear the name either of definitions or of principles. It\nis either a principle or a definition that 1 and 1 make 2, that 2 and 1\nmake 3, and so on; that white differs less from gray than it does from\nblack; that when the cause begins to act the effect also commences. Such\npropositions hold of all possible 'ones,' of all conceivable 'whites'\nand 'grays' and 'causes.' The objects here are mental objects.\nTheir relations are perceptually obvious at a glance, and no\nsense-verification is necessary. Moreover, once true, always true, of\nthose same mental objects. Truth here has an 'eternal' character. If you\ncan find a concrete thing anywhere that is 'one' or 'white' or 'gray,'\nor an 'effect,' then your principles will everlastingly apply to it. It\nis but a case of ascertaining the kind, and then applying the law of its\nkind to the particular object. You are sure to get truth if you can but\nname the kind rightly, for your mental relations hold good of everything\nof that kind without exception. If you then, nevertheless, failed to get\ntruth concretely, you would say that you had classed your real objects\nwrongly.\nIn this realm of mental relations, truth again is an affair of leading.\nWe relate one abstract idea with another, framing in the end great\nsystems of logical and mathematical truth, under the respective terms of\nwhich the sensible facts of experience eventually arrange themselves,\nso that our eternal truths hold good of realities also. This marriage of\nfact and theory is endlessly fertile. What we say is here already true\nin advance of special verification, IF WE HAVE SUBSUMED OUR OBJECTS\nRIGHTLY. Our ready-made ideal framework for all sorts of possible\nobjects follows from the very structure of our thinking. We can no more\nplay fast and loose with these abstract relations than we can do so with\nour sense-experiences. They coerce us; we must treat them consistently,\nwhether or not we like the results. The rules of addition apply to our\ndebts as rigorously as to our assets. The hundredth decimal of pi, the\nratio of the circumference to its diameter, is predetermined ideally\nnow, tho no one may have computed it. If we should ever need the figure\nin our dealings with an actual circle we should need to have it given\nrightly, calculated by the usual rules; for it is the same kind of truth\nthat those rules elsewhere calculate.\nBetween the coercions of the sensible order and those of the ideal\norder, our mind is thus wedged tightly. Our ideas must agree with\nrealities, be such realities concrete or abstract, be they facts or be\nthey principles, under penalty of endless inconsistency and frustration.\nSo far, intellectualists can raise no protest. They can only say that we\nhave barely touched the skin of the matter.\nRealities mean, then, either concrete facts, or abstract kinds of things\nand relations perceived intuitively between them. They furthermore and\nthirdly mean, as things that new ideas of ours must no less take account\nof, the whole body of other truths already in our possession. But what\nnow does 'agreement' with such three-fold realities mean?--to use again\nthe definition that is current.\nHere it is that pragmatism and intellectualism begin to part company.\nPrimarily, no doubt, to agree means to copy, but we saw that the mere\nword 'clock' would do instead of a mental picture of its works, and that\nof many realities our ideas can only be symbols and not copies. 'Past\ntime,' 'power,' 'spontaneity'--how can our mind copy such realities?\nTo 'agree' in the widest sense with a reality, CAN ONLY MEAN TO BE\nGUIDED EITHER STRAIGHT UP TO IT OR INTO ITS SURROUNDINGS, OR TO BE PUT\nINTO SUCH WORKING TOUCH WITH IT AS TO HANDLE EITHER IT OR SOMETHING\nCONNECTED WITH IT BETTER THAN IF WE DISAGREED. Better either\nintellectually or practically! And often agreement will only mean\nthe negative fact that nothing contradictory from the quarter of that\nreality comes to interfere with the way in which our ideas guide us\nelsewhere. To copy a reality is, indeed, one very important way of\nagreeing with it, but it is far from being essential. The essential\nthing is the process of being guided. Any idea that helps us to DEAL,\nwhether practically or intellectually, with either the reality or its\nbelongings, that doesn't entangle our progress in frustrations, that\nFITS, in fact, and adapts our life to the reality's whole setting, will\nagree sufficiently to meet the requirement. It will hold true of that\nreality.\nThus, NAMES are just as 'true' or 'false' as definite mental pictures\nare. They set up similar verification-processes, and lead to fully\nequivalent practical results.\nAll human thinking gets discursified; we exchange ideas; we lend and\nborrow verifications, get them from one another by means of social\nintercourse. All truth thus gets verbally built out, stored up, and made\navailable for everyone. Hence, we must TALK consistently just as we must\nTHINK consistently: for both in talk and thought we deal with kinds.\nNames are arbitrary, but once understood they must be kept to. We\nmustn't now call Abel 'Cain' or Cain 'Abel.' If we do, we ungear\nourselves from the whole book of Genesis, and from all its connexions\nwith the universe of speech and fact down to the present time. We throw\nourselves out of whatever truth that entire system of speech and fact\nmay embody.\nThe overwhelming majority of our true ideas admit of no direct or\nface-to-face verification-those of past history, for example, as of Cain\nand Abel. The stream of time can be remounted only verbally, or verified\nindirectly by the present prolongations or effects of what the past\nharbored. Yet if they agree with these verbalities and effects, we can\nknow that our ideas of the past are true. AS TRUE AS PAST TIME ITSELF\nWAS, so true was Julius Caesar, so true were antediluvian monsters,\nall in their proper dates and settings. That past time itself was, is\nguaranteed by its coherence with everything that's present. True as the\npresent is, the past was also.\nAgreement thus turns out to be essentially an affair of leading--leading\nthat is useful because it is into quarters that contain objects that are\nimportant. True ideas lead us into useful verbal and conceptual\nquarters as well as directly up to useful sensible termini. They lead\nto consistency, stability and flowing human intercourse. They lead away\nfrom excentricity and isolation, from foiled and barren thinking. The\nuntrammeled flowing of the leading-process, its general freedom from\nclash and contradiction, passes for its indirect verification; but all\nroads lead to Rome, and in the end and eventually, all true processes\nmust lead to the face of directly verifying sensible experiences\nSOMEWHERE, which somebody's ideas have copied.\nSuch is the large loose way in which the pragmatist interprets the word\nagreement. He treats it altogether practically. He lets it cover any\nprocess of conduction from a present idea to a future terminus, provided\nonly it run prosperously. It is only thus that 'scientific' ideas,\nflying as they do beyond common sense, can be said to agree with their\nrealities. It is, as I have already said, as if reality were made of\nether, atoms or electrons, but we mustn't think so literally. The term\n'energy' doesn't even pretend to stand for anything 'objective.' It is\nonly a way of measuring the surface of phenomena so as to string their\nchanges on a simple formula.\nYet in the choice of these man-made formulas we cannot be capricious\nwith impunity any more than we can be capricious on the common-sense\npractical level. We must find a theory that will WORK; and that means\nsomething extremely difficult; for our theory must mediate between all\nprevious truths and certain new experiences. It must derange common\nsense and previous belief as little as possible, and it must lead to\nsome sensible terminus or other that can be verified exactly. To 'work'\nmeans both these things; and the squeeze is so tight that there is\nlittle loose play for any hypothesis. Our theories are wedged and\ncontrolled as nothing else is. Yet sometimes alternative theoretic\nformulas are equally compatible with all the truths we know, and then we\nchoose between them for subjective reasons. We choose the kind of theory\nto which we are already partial; we follow 'elegance' or 'economy.'\nClerk Maxwell somewhere says it would be \"poor scientific taste\" to\nchoose the more complicated of two equally well-evidenced conceptions;\nand you will all agree with him. Truth in science is what gives us the\nmaximum possible sum of satisfactions, taste included, but consistency\nboth with previous truth and with novel fact is always the most\nimperious claimant.\nI have led you through a very sandy desert. But now, if I may be allowed\nso vulgar an expression, we begin to taste the milk in the cocoanut. Our\nrationalist critics here discharge their batteries upon us, and to reply\nto them will take us out from all this dryness into full sight of a\nmomentous philosophical alternative.\nOur account of truth is an account of truths in the plural, of processes\nof leading, realized in rebus, and having only this quality in common,\nthat they PAY. They pay by guiding us into or towards some part of a\nsystem that dips at numerous points into sense-percepts, which we may\ncopy mentally or not, but with which at any rate we are now in the kind\nof commerce vaguely designated as verification. Truth for us is simply\na collective name for verification-processes, just as health, wealth,\nstrength, etc., are names for other processes connected with life, and\nalso pursued because it pays to pursue them. Truth is MADE, just as\nhealth, wealth and strength are made, in the course of experience.\nHere rationalism is instantaneously up in arms against us. I can imagine\na rationalist to talk as follows:\n\"Truth is not made,\" he will say; \"it absolutely obtains, being a unique\nrelation that does not wait upon any process, but shoots straight over\nthe head of experience, and hits its reality every time. Our belief that\nyon thing on the wall is a clock is true already, altho no one in\nthe whole history of the world should verify it. The bare quality of\nstanding in that transcendent relation is what makes any thought true\nthat possesses it, whether or not there be verification. You pragmatists\nput the cart before the horse in making truth's being reside in\nverification-processes. These are merely signs of its being, merely our\nlame ways of ascertaining after the fact, which of our ideas already has\npossessed the wondrous quality. The quality itself is timeless, like all\nessences and natures. Thoughts partake of it directly, as they partake\nof falsity or of irrelevancy. It can't be analyzed away into pragmatic\nconsequences.\"\nThe whole plausibility of this rationalist tirade is due to the fact\nto which we have already paid so much attention. In our world,\nnamely, abounding as it does in things of similar kinds and similarly\nassociated, one verification serves for others of its kind, and one\ngreat use of knowing things is to be led not so much to them as to their\nassociates, especially to human talk about them. The quality of truth,\nobtaining ante rem, pragmatically means, then, the fact that in such a\nworld innumerable ideas work better by their indirect or possible than\nby their direct and actual verification. Truth ante rem means only\nverifiability, then; or else it is a case of the stock rationalist trick\nof treating the NAME of a concrete phenomenal reality as an independent\nprior entity, and placing it behind the reality as its explanation.\nProfessor Mach quotes somewhere an epigram of Lessing's:\nSagt Hanschen Schlau zu Vetter Fritz, \"Wie kommt es, Vetter Fritzen,\nDass grad' die Reichsten in der Welt, Das meiste Geld besitzen?\"\nHanschen Schlau here treats the principle 'wealth' as something distinct\nfrom the facts denoted by the man's being rich. It antedates them; the\nfacts become only a sort of secondary coincidence with the rich man's\nessential nature.\nIn the case of 'wealth' we all see the fallacy. We know that wealth is\nbut a name for concrete processes that certain men's lives play a\npart in, and not a natural excellence found in Messrs. Rockefeller and\nCarnegie, but not in the rest of us.\nLike wealth, health also lives in rebus. It is a name for processes,\nas digestion, circulation, sleep, etc., that go on happily, tho in this\ninstance we are more inclined to think of it as a principle and to say\nthe man digests and sleeps so well BECAUSE he is so healthy.\nWith 'strength' we are, I think, more rationalistic still, and decidedly\ninclined to treat it as an excellence pre-existing in the man and\nexplanatory of the herculean performances of his muscles.\nWith 'truth' most people go over the border entirely, and treat the\nrationalistic account as self-evident. But really all these words in TH\nare exactly similar. Truth exists ante rem just as much and as little as\nthe other things do.\nThe scholastics, following Aristotle, made much of the distinction\nbetween habit and act. Health in actu means, among other things, good\nsleeping and digesting. But a healthy man need not always be sleeping,\nor always digesting, any more than a wealthy man need be always handling\nmoney, or a strong man always lifting weights. All such qualities sink\nto the status of 'habits' between their times of exercise; and similarly\ntruth becomes a habit of certain of our ideas and beliefs in their\nintervals of rest from their verifying activities. But those activities\nare the root of the whole matter, and the condition of there being any\nhabit to exist in the intervals.\n'The true,' to put it very briefly, is only the expedient in the way of\nour thinking, just as 'the right' is only the expedient in the way of\nour behaving. Expedient in almost any fashion; and expedient in the\nlong run and on the whole of course; for what meets expediently all\nthe experience in sight won't necessarily meet all farther experiences\nequally satisfactorily. Experience, as we know, has ways of BOILING\nOVER, and making us correct our present formulas.\nThe 'absolutely' true, meaning what no farther experience will ever\nalter, is that ideal vanishing-point towards which we imagine that all\nour temporary truths will some day converge. It runs on all fours with\nthe perfectly wise man, and with the absolutely complete experience;\nand, if these ideals are ever realized, they will all be realized\ntogether. Meanwhile we have to live to-day by what truth we can\nget to-day, and be ready to-morrow to call it falsehood. Ptolemaic\nastronomy, euclidean space, aristotelian logic, scholastic metaphysics,\nwere expedient for centuries, but human experience has boiled over\nthose limits, and we now call these things only relatively true, or true\nwithin those borders of experience. 'Absolutely' they are false; for we\nknow that those limits were casual, and might have been transcended by\npast theorists just as they are by present thinkers.\nWhen new experiences lead to retrospective judgments, using the past\ntense, what these judgments utter WAS true, even tho no past thinker\nhad been led there. We live forwards, a Danish thinker has said, but we\nunderstand backwards. The present sheds a backward light on the world's\nprevious processes. They may have been truth-processes for the actors\nin them. They are not so for one who knows the later revelations of the\nstory.\nThis regulative notion of a potential better truth to be established\nlater, possibly to be established some day absolutely, and having powers\nof retroactive legislation, turns its face, like all pragmatist\nnotions, towards concreteness of fact, and towards the future. Like the\nhalf-truths, the absolute truth will have to be MADE, made as a relation\nincidental to the growth of a mass of verification-experience, to which\nthe half-true ideas are all along contributing their quota.\nI have already insisted on the fact that truth is made largely out\nof previous truths. Men's beliefs at any time are so much experience\nfunded. But the beliefs are themselves parts of the sum total of the\nworld's experience, and become matter, therefore, for the next day's\nfunding operations. So far as reality means experienceable reality,\nboth it and the truths men gain about it are everlastingly in process\nof mutation-mutation towards a definite goal, it may be--but still\nmutation.\nMathematicians can solve problems with two variables. On the Newtonian\ntheory, for instance, acceleration varies with distance, but distance\nalso varies with acceleration. In the realm of truth-processes facts\ncome independently and determine our beliefs provisionally. But these\nbeliefs make us act, and as fast as they do so, they bring into sight or\ninto existence new facts which re-determine the beliefs accordingly. So\nthe whole coil and ball of truth, as it rolls up, is the product of a\ndouble influence. Truths emerge from facts; but they dip forward into\nfacts again and add to them; which facts again create or reveal new\ntruth (the word is indifferent) and so on indefinitely. The 'facts'\nthemselves meanwhile are not TRUE. They simply ARE. Truth is the\nfunction of the beliefs that start and terminate among them.\nThe case is like a snowball's growth, due as it is to the distribution\nof the snow on the one hand, and to the successive pushes of the boys on\nthe other, with these factors co-determining each other incessantly.\nThe most fateful point of difference between being a rationalist and\nbeing a pragmatist is now fully in sight. Experience is in mutation,\nand our psychological ascertainments of truth are in mutation--so much\nrationalism will allow; but never that either reality itself or truth\nitself is mutable. Reality stands complete and ready-made from all\neternity, rationalism insists, and the agreement of our ideas with it\nis that unique unanalyzable virtue in them of which she has already told\nus. As that intrinsic excellence, their truth has nothing to do with our\nexperiences. It adds nothing to the content of experience. It makes\nno difference to reality itself; it is supervenient, inert, static, a\nreflexion merely. It doesn't EXIST, it HOLDS or OBTAINS, it belongs to\nanother dimension from that of either facts or fact-relations, belongs,\nin short, to the epistemological dimension--and with that big word\nrationalism closes the discussion.\nThus, just as pragmatism faces forward to the future, so does\nrationalism here again face backward to a past eternity. True to her\ninveterate habit, rationalism reverts to 'principles,' and thinks that\nwhen an abstraction once is named, we own an oracular solution.\nThe tremendous pregnancy in the way of consequences for life of this\nradical difference of outlook will only become apparent in my later\nlectures. I wish meanwhile to close this lecture by showing that\nrationalism's sublimity does not save it from inanity.\nWhen, namely, you ask rationalists, instead of accusing pragmatism\nof desecrating the notion of truth, to define it themselves by saying\nexactly what THEY understand by it, the only positive attempts I can\nthink of are these two:\n1. \"Truth is just the system of propositions which have an\nun-conditional claim to be recognized as valid.\" [Footnote: A. E.\nTaylor, Philosophical Review, vol. xiv, p. 288.]\n2. Truth is a name for all those judgments which we find ourselves under\nobligation to make by a kind of imperative duty. [Footnote: H.\nRickert, Der Gegenstand der Erkenntniss, chapter on 'Die\nUrtheilsnothwendigkeit.']\nThe first thing that strikes one in such definitions is their\nunutterable triviality. They are absolutely true, of course, but\nabsolutely insignificant until you handle them pragmatically. What do\nyou mean by 'claim' here, and what do you mean by 'duty'? As\nsummary names for the concrete reasons why thinking in true ways is\noverwhelmingly expedient and good for mortal men, it is all right to\ntalk of claims on reality's part to be agreed with, and of obligations\non our part to agree. We feel both the claims and the obligations, and\nwe feel them for just those reasons.\nBut the rationalists who talk of claim and obligation EXPRESSLY SAY\nTHAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR PRACTICAL INTERESTS OR PERSONAL\nREASONS. Our reasons for agreeing are psychological facts, they say,\nrelative to each thinker, and to the accidents of his life. They are his\nevidence merely, they are no part of the life of truth itself. That\nlife transacts itself in a purely logical or epistemological, as\ndistinguished from a psychological, dimension, and its claims antedate\nand exceed all personal motivations whatsoever. Tho neither man nor God\nshould ever ascertain truth, the word would still have to be defined as\nthat which OUGHT to be ascertained and recognized.\nThere never was a more exquisite example of an idea abstracted from the\nconcretes of experience and then used to oppose and negate what it was\nabstracted from.\nPhilosophy and common life abound in similar instances. The\n'sentimentalist fallacy' is to shed tears over abstract justice and\ngenerosity, beauty, etc., and never to know these qualities when you\nmeet them in the street, because there the circumstances make them\nvulgar. Thus I read in the privately printed biography of an eminently\nrationalistic mind: \"It was strange that with such admiration for beauty\nin the abstract, my brother had no enthusiasm for fine architecture, for\nbeautiful painting, or for flowers.\" And in almost the last philosophic\nwork I have read, I find such passages as the following: \"Justice\nis ideal, solely ideal. Reason conceives that it ought to exist, but\nexperience shows that it can-not. ... Truth, which ought to be, cannot\nbe. ... Reason is deformed by experience. As soon as reason enters\nexperience, it becomes contrary to reason.\"\nThe rationalist's fallacy here is exactly like the sentimentalist's.\nBoth extract a quality from the muddy particulars of experience, and\nfind it so pure when extracted that they contrast it with each and all\nits muddy instances as an opposite and higher nature. All the while it\nis THEIR nature. It is the nature of truths to be validated, verified.\nIt pays for our ideas to be validated. Our obligation to seek truth is\npart of our general obligation to do what pays. The payments true ideas\nbring are the sole why of our duty to follow them.\nIdentical whys exist in the case of wealth and health. Truth makes no\nother kind of claim and imposes no other kind of ought than health and\nwealth do. All these claims are conditional; the concrete benefits we\ngain are what we mean by calling the pursuit a duty. In the case of\ntruth, untrue beliefs work as perniciously in the long run as true\nbeliefs work beneficially. Talking abstractly, the quality 'true' may\nthus be said to grow absolutely precious, and the quality 'untrue'\nabsolutely damnable: the one may be called good, the other bad,\nunconditionally. We ought to think the true, we ought to shun the false,\nimperatively.\nBut if we treat all this abstraction literally and oppose it to its\nmother soil in experience, see what a preposterous position we work\nourselves into.\nWe cannot then take a step forward in our actual thinking. When shall\nI acknowledge this truth and when that? Shall the acknowledgment be\nloud?--or silent? If sometimes loud, sometimes silent, which NOW? When\nmay a truth go into cold-storage in the encyclopedia? and when shall it\ncome out for battle? Must I constantly be repeating the truth 'twice\ntwo are four' because of its eternal claim on recognition? or is\nit sometimes irrelevant? Must my thoughts dwell night and day on my\npersonal sins and blemishes, because I truly have them?--or may I sink\nand ignore them in order to be a decent social unit, and not a mass of\nmorbid melancholy and apology?\nIt is quite evident that our obligation to acknowledge truth, so far\nfrom being unconditional, is tremendously conditioned. Truth with a big\nT, and in the singular, claims abstractly to be recognized, of course;\nbut concrete truths in the plural need be recognized only when their\nrecognition is expedient. A truth must always be preferred to a\nfalsehood when both relate to the situation; but when neither does,\ntruth is as little of a duty as falsehood. If you ask me what o'clock it\nis and I tell you that I live at 95 Irving Street, my answer may indeed\nbe true, but you don't see why it is my duty to give it. A false address\nwould be as much to the purpose.\nWith this admission that there are conditions that limit the application\nof the abstract imperative, THE PRAGMATISTIC TREATMENT OF TRUTH SWEEPS\nBACK UPON US IN ITS FULNESS. Our duty to agree with reality is seen to\nbe grounded in a perfect jungle of concrete expediencies.\nWhen Berkeley had explained what people meant by matter, people thought\nthat he denied matter's existence. When Messrs. Schiller and Dewey\nnow explain what people mean by truth, they are accused of denying ITS\nexistence. These pragmatists destroy all objective standards, critics\nsay, and put foolishness and wisdom on one level. A favorite formula for\ndescribing Mr. Schiller's doctrines and mine is that we are persons who\nthink that by saying whatever you find it pleasant to say and calling it\ntruth you fulfil every pragmatistic requirement.\nI leave it to you to judge whether this be not an impudent slander. Pent\nin, as the pragmatist more than anyone else sees himself to be, between\nthe whole body of funded truths squeezed from the past and the coercions\nof the world of sense about him, who so well as he feels the immense\npressure of objective control under which our minds perform their\noperations? If anyone imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its\ncommandment one day, says Emerson. We have heard much of late of the\nuses of the imagination in science. It is high time to urge the use of\na little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our\ncritics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our\nstatements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know\nin recent philosophic history. Schiller says the true is that which\n'works.' Thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to\nthe lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives\n'satisfaction.' He is treated as one who believes in calling everything\ntrue which, if it were true, would be pleasant.\nOur critics certainly need more imagination of realities. I have\nhonestly tried to stretch my own imagination and to read the best\npossible meaning into the rationalist conception, but I have to confess\nthat it still completely baffles me. The notion of a reality calling on\nus to 'agree' with it, and that for no reasons, but simply because\nits claim is 'unconditional' or 'transcendent,' is one that I can make\nneither head nor tail of. I try to imagine myself as the sole reality\nin the world, and then to imagine what more I would 'claim' if I were\nallowed to. If you suggest the possibility of my claiming that a mind\nshould come into being from out of the void inane and stand and COPY me,\nI can indeed imagine what the copying might mean, but I can conjure up\nno motive. What good it would do me to be copied, or what good it would\ndo that mind to copy me, if farther consequences are expressly and\nin principle ruled out as motives for the claim (as they are by our\nrationalist authorities) I cannot fathom. When the Irishman's admirers\nran him along to the place of banquet in a sedan chair with no bottom,\nhe said, \"Faith, if it wasn't for the honor of the thing, I might as\nwell have come on foot.\" So here: but for the honor of the thing, I\nmight as well have remained uncopied. Copying is one genuine mode\nof knowing (which for some strange reason our contemporary\ntranscendentalists seem to be tumbling over each other to repudiate);\nbut when we get beyond copying, and fall back on unnamed forms of\nagreeing that are expressly denied to be either copyings or leadings or\nfittings, or any other processes pragmatically definable, the WHAT of\nthe 'agreement' claimed becomes as unintelligible as the why of it.\nNeither content nor motive can be imagined for it. It is an absolutely\nmeaningless abstraction. [Footnote: I am not forgetting that Professor\nRickert long ago gave up the whole notion of truth being founded on\nagreement with reality. Reality, according to him, is whatever agrees\nwith truth, and truth is founded solely on our primal duty. This\nfantastic flight, together with Mr. Joachim's candid confession of\nfailure in his book The Nature of Truth, seems to me to mark the\nbankruptcy of rationalism when dealing with this subject. Rickert deals\nwith part of the pragmatistic position under the head of what he calls\n'Relativismus.' I cannot discuss his text here. Suffice it to say\nthat his argumentation in that chapter is so feeble as to seem almost\nincredible in so generally able a writer.]\nSurely in this field of truth it is the pragmatists and not the\nrationalists who are the more genuine defenders of the universe's\nrationality.\nLecture VII\nPragmatism and Humanism\nWhat hardens the heart of everyone I approach with the view of truth\nsketched in my last lecture is that typical idol of the tribe, the\nnotion of THE Truth, conceived as the one answer, determinate and\ncomplete, to the one fixed enigma which the world is believed to\npropound. For popular tradition, it is all the better if the answer\nbe oracular, so as itself to awaken wonder as an enigma of the second\norder, veiling rather than revealing what its profundities are supposed\nto contain. All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle,\nsuch as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the\nDialectic Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration\nthat men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in\nphilosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as\na queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a\nmonotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect\nidol of the rationalistic mind! I read in an old letter--from a gifted\nfriend who died too young--these words: \"In everything, in science, art,\nmorals and religion, there MUST be one system that is right and EVERY\nother wrong.\" How characteristic of the enthusiasm of a certain stage of\nyouth! At twenty-one we rise to such a challenge and expect to find the\nsystem. It never occurs to most of us even later that the question 'what\nis THE truth?' is no real question (being irrelative to all conditions)\nand that the whole notion of THE truth is an abstraction from the fact\nof truths in the plural, a mere useful summarizing phrase like THE Latin\nLanguage or THE Law.\nCommon-law judges sometimes talk about the law, and school-masters talk\nabout the latin tongue, in a way to make their hearers think they mean\nentities pre-existent to the decisions or to the words and syntax,\ndetermining them unequivocally and requiring them to obey. But the\nslightest exercise of reflexion makes us see that, instead of being\nprinciples of this kind, both law and latin are results. Distinctions\nbetween the lawful and the unlawful in conduct, or between the\ncorrect and incorrect in speech, have grown up incidentally among the\ninteractions of men's experiences in detail; and in no other way do\ndistinctions between the true and the false in belief ever grow up.\nTruth grafts itself on previous truth, modifying it in the process, just\nas idiom grafts itself on previous idiom, and law on previous law. Given\nprevious law and a novel case, and the judge will twist them into fresh\nlaw. Previous idiom; new slang or metaphor or oddity that hits the\npublic taste:--and presto, a new idiom is made. Previous truth; fresh\nfacts:--and our mind finds a new truth.\nAll the while, however, we pretend that the eternal is unrolling, that\nthe one previous justice, grammar or truth is simply fulgurating, and\nnot being made. But imagine a youth in the courtroom trying cases with\nhis abstract notion of 'the' law, or a censor of speech let loose\namong the theatres with his idea of 'the' mother-tongue, or a professor\nsetting up to lecture on the actual universe with his rationalistic\nnotion of 'the Truth' with a big T, and what progress do they make?\nTruth, law, and language fairly boil away from them at the least touch\nof novel fact. These things MAKE THEMSELVES as we go. Our rights,\nwrongs, prohibitions, penalties, words, forms, idioms, beliefs, are so\nmany new creations that add themselves as fast as history proceeds.\nFar from being antecedent principles that animate the process, law,\nlanguage, truth are but abstract names for its results.\nLaws and languages at any rate are thus seen to be man-made: things.\nMr. Schiller applies the analogy to beliefs, and proposes the name of\n'Humanism' for the doctrine that to an unascertainable extent our truths\nare man-made products too. Human motives sharpen all our questions,\nhuman satisfactions lurk in all our answers, all our formulas have a\nhuman twist. This element is so inextricable in the products that Mr.\nSchiller sometimes seems almost to leave it an open question whether\nthere be anything else. \"The world,\" he says, \"is essentially [u lambda\nnu], it is what we make of it. It is fruitless to define it by what it\noriginally was or by what it is apart from us; it IS what is made of it.\nHence ... the world is PLASTIC.\" [Footnote: Personal Idealism, p. 60.]\nHe adds that we can learn the limits of the plasticity only by trying,\nand that we ought to start as if it were wholly plastic, acting\nmethodically on that assumption, and stopping only when we are\ndecisively rebuked.\nThis is Mr. Schiller's butt-end-foremost statement of the humanist\nposition, and it has exposed him to severe attack. I mean to defend the\nhumanist position in this lecture, so I will insinuate a few remarks at\nthis point.\nMr. Schiller admits as emphatically as anyone the presence of resisting\nfactors in every actual experience of truth-making, of which the\nnew-made special truth must take account, and with which it has perforce\nto 'agree.' All our truths are beliefs about 'Reality'; and in any\nparticular belief the reality acts as something independent, as a thing\nFOUND, not manufactured. Let me here recall a bit of my last lecture.\n'REALITY' IS IN GENERAL WHAT TRUTHS HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF; [Footnote:\nMr. Taylor in his Elements of Metaphysics uses this excellent pragmatic\ndefinition.] and the FIRST part of reality from this point of view is\nthe flux of our sensations. Sensations are forced upon us, coming we\nknow not whence. Over their nature, order, and quantity we have as good\nas no control. THEY are neither true nor false; they simply ARE. It is\nonly what we say about them, only the names we give them, our theories\nof their source and nature and remote relations, that may be true or\nnot.\nThe SECOND part of reality, as something that our beliefs must also\nobediently take account of, is the RELATIONS that obtain between our\nsensations or between their copies in our minds. This part falls into\ntwo sub-parts: 1) the relations that are mutable and accidental, as\nthose of date and place; and 2) those that are fixed and essential\nbecause they are grounded on the inner natures of their terms--such as\nlikeness and unlikeness. Both sorts of relation are matters of immediate\nperception. Both are 'facts.' But it is the latter kind of fact that\nforms the more important sub-part of reality for our theories of\nknowledge. Inner relations namely are 'eternal,' are perceived whenever\ntheir sensible terms are compared; and of them our thought--mathematical\nand logical thought, so-called--must eternally take account.\nThe THIRD part of reality, additional to these perceptions (tho largely\nbased upon them), is the PREVIOUS TRUTHS of which every new inquiry\ntakes account. This third part is a much less obdurately resisting\nfactor: it often ends by giving way. In speaking of these three portions\nof reality as at all times controlling our belief's formation, I am only\nreminding you of what we heard in our last hour.\nNow however fixed these elements of reality may be, we still have a\ncertain freedom in our dealings with them. Take our sensations. THAT\nthey are is undoubtedly beyond our control; but WHICH we attend to,\nnote, and make emphatic in our conclusions depends on our own interests;\nand, according as we lay the emphasis here or there, quite different\nformulations of truth result. We read the same facts differently.\n'Waterloo,' with the same fixed details, spells a 'victory' for an\nenglishman; for a frenchman it spells a 'defeat.' So, for an optimist\nphilosopher the universe spells victory, for a pessimist, defeat.\nWhat we say about reality thus depends on the perspective into which we\nthrow it. The THAT of it is its own; but the WHAT depends on the WHICH;\nand the which depends on US. Both the sensational and the relational\nparts of reality are dumb: they say absolutely nothing about themselves.\nWe it is who have to speak for them. This dumbness of sensations has\nled such intellectualists as T.H. Green and Edward Caird to shove them\nalmost beyond the pale of philosophic recognition, but pragmatists\nrefuse to go so far. A sensation is rather like a client who has given\nhis case to a lawyer and then has passively to listen in the courtroom\nto whatever account of his affairs, pleasant or unpleasant, the lawyer\nfinds it most expedient to give.\nHence, even in the field of sensation, our minds exert a certain\narbitrary choice. By our inclusions and omissions we trace the field's\nextent; by our emphasis we mark its foreground and its background; by\nour order we read it in this direction or in that. We receive in short\nthe block of marble, but we carve the statue ourselves.\nThis applies to the 'eternal' parts of reality as well: we shuffle our\nperceptions of intrinsic relation and arrange them just as freely. We\nread them in one serial order or another, class them in this way or\nin that, treat one or the other as more fundamental, until our beliefs\nabout them form those bodies of truth known as logics, geometries, or\narithmetics, in each and all of which the form and order in which the\nwhole is cast is flagrantly man-made.\nThus, to say nothing of the new FACTS which men add to the matter of\nreality by the acts of their own lives, they have already impressed\ntheir mental forms on that whole third of reality which I have called\n'previous truths.' Every hour brings its new percepts, its own facts of\nsensation and relation, to be truly taken account of; but the whole\nof our PAST dealings with such facts is already funded in the previous\ntruths. It is therefore only the smallest and recentest fraction of the\nfirst two parts of reality that comes to us without the human touch, and\nthat fraction has immediately to become humanized in the sense of being\nsquared, assimilated, or in some way adapted, to the humanized mass\nalready there. As a matter of fact we can hardly take in an impression\nat all, in the absence of a pre-conception of what impressions there may\npossibly be.\nWhen we talk of reality 'independent' of human thinking, then, it seems\na thing very hard to find. It reduces to the notion of what is just\nentering into experience, and yet to be named, or else to some imagined\naboriginal presence in experience, before any belief about the presence\nhad arisen, before any human conception had been applied. It is what is\nabsolutely dumb and evanescent, the merely ideal limit of our minds.\nWe may glimpse it, but we never grasp it; what we grasp is always some\nsubstitute for it which previous human thinking has peptonized and\ncooked for our consumption. If so vulgar an expression were allowed us,\nwe might say that wherever we find it, it has been already FAKED. This\nis what Mr. Schiller has in mind when he calls independent reality a\nmere unresisting [u lambda nu], which IS only to be made over by us.\nThat is Mr. Schiller's belief about the sensible core of reality.\nWe 'encounter' it (in Mr. Bradley's words) but don't possess it.\nSuperficially this sounds like Kant's view; but between categories\nfulminated before nature began, and categories gradually forming\nthemselves in nature's presence, the whole chasm between rationalism and\nempiricism yawns. To the genuine 'Kantianer' Schiller will always be to\nKant as a satyr to Hyperion.\nOther pragmatists may reach more positive beliefs about the sensible\ncore of reality. They may think to get at it in its independent nature,\nby peeling off the successive man-made wrappings. They may make theories\nthat tell us where it comes from and all about it; and if these theories\nwork satisfactorily they will be true. The transcendental idealists say\nthere is no core, the finally completed wrapping being reality and truth\nin one. Scholasticism still teaches that the core is 'matter.' Professor\nBergson, Heymans, Strong, and others, believe in the core and bravely\ntry to define it. Messrs. Dewey and Schiller treat it as a 'limit.'\nWhich is the truer of all these diverse accounts, or of others\ncomparable with them, unless it be the one that finally proves the most\nsatisfactory? On the one hand there will stand reality, on the other\nan account of it which proves impossible to better or to alter. If\nthe impossibility prove permanent, the truth of the account will be\nabsolute. Other content of truth than this I can find nowhere. If the\nanti-pragmatists have any other meaning, let them for heaven's sake\nreveal it, let them grant us access to it!\nNot BEING reality, but only our belief ABOUT reality, it will contain\nhuman elements, but these will KNOW the non-human element, in the only\nsense in which there can be knowledge of anything. Does the river make\nits banks, or do the banks make the river? Does a man walk with his\nright leg or with his left leg more essentially? Just as impossible may\nit be to separate the real from the human factors in the growth of our\ncognitive experience.\nLet this stand as a first brief indication of the humanistic position.\nDoes it seem paradoxical? If so, I will try to make it plausible by a\nfew illustrations, which will lead to a fuller acquaintance with the\nsubject.\nIn many familiar objects everyone will recognize the human element. We\nconceive a given reality in this way or in that, to suit our purpose,\nand the reality passively submits to the conception. You can take the\nnumber 27 as the cube of 3, or as the product of 3 and 9, or as 26 PLUS\n1, or 100 MINUS 73, or in countless other ways, of which one will be\njust as true as another. You can take a chessboard as black squares on\na white ground, or as white squares on a black ground, and neither\nconception is a false one. You can treat the adjoined figure [Figure of\na 'Star of David'] as a star, as two big triangles crossing each other,\nas a hexagon with legs set up on its angles, as six equal triangles\nhanging together by their tips, etc. All these treatments are true\ntreatments--the sensible THAT upon the paper resists no one of them. You\ncan say of a line that it runs east, or you can say that it runs west,\nand the line per se accepts both descriptions without rebelling at the\ninconsistency.\nWe carve out groups of stars in the heavens, and call them\nconstellations, and the stars patiently suffer us to do so--tho if they\nknew what we were doing, some of them might feel much surprised at the\npartners we had given them. We name the same constellation diversely, as\nCharles's Wain, the Great Bear, or the Dipper. None of the names will be\nfalse, and one will be as true as another, for all are applicable.\nIn all these cases we humanly make an addition to some sensible reality,\nand that reality tolerates the addition. All the additions 'agree' with\nthe reality; they fit it, while they build it out. No one of them is\nfalse. Which may be treated as the more true, depends altogether on\nthe human use of it. If the 27 is a number of dollars which I find in\na drawer where I had left 28, it is 28 minus 1. If it is the number of\ninches in a shelf which I wish to insert into a cupboard 26 inches wide,\nit is 26 plus 1. If I wish to ennoble the heavens by the constellations\nI see there, 'Charles's Wain' would be more true than 'Dipper.' My\nfriend Frederick Myers was humorously indignant that that prodigious\nstar-group should remind us Americans of nothing but a culinary utensil.\nWhat shall we call a THING anyhow? It seems quite arbitrary, for we\ncarve out everything, just as we carve out constellations, to suit our\nhuman purposes. For me, this whole 'audience' is one thing, which grows\nnow restless, now attentive. I have no use at present for its individual\nunits, so I don't consider them. So of an 'army,' of a 'nation.' But\nin your own eyes, ladies and gentlemen, to call you 'audience' is an\naccidental way of taking you. The permanently real things for you are\nyour individual persons. To an anatomist, again, those persons are but\norganisms, and the real things are the organs. Not the organs, so much\nas their constituent cells, say the histologists; not the cells, but\ntheir molecules, say in turn the chemists.\nWe break the flux of sensible reality into things, then, at our will. We\ncreate the subjects of our true as well as of our false propositions.\nWe create the predicates also. Many of the predicates of things express\nonly the relations of the things to us and to our feelings. Such\npredicates of course are human additions. Caesar crossed the Rubicon,\nand was a menace to Rome's freedom. He is also an American school-room\npest, made into one by the reaction of our schoolboys on his writings.\nThe added predicate is as true of him as the earlier ones.\nYou see how naturally one comes to the humanistic principle: you can't\nweed out the human contribution. Our nouns and adjectives are all\nhumanized heirlooms, and in the theories we build them into, the inner\norder and arrangement is wholly dictated by human considerations,\nintellectual consistency being one of them. Mathematics and logic\nthemselves are fermenting with human rearrangements; physics, astronomy\nand biology follow massive cues of preference. We plunge forward into\nthe field of fresh experience with the beliefs our ancestors and we have\nmade already; these determine what we notice; what we notice determines\nwhat we do; what we do again determines what we experience; so from\none thing to another, altho the stubborn fact remains that there IS a\nsensible flux, what is true of it seems from first to last to be largely\na matter of our own creation.\nWe build the flux out inevitably. The great question is: does it,\nwith our additions, rise or fall in value? Are the additions WORTHY or\nUNWORTHY? Suppose a universe composed of seven stars, and nothing else\nbut three human witnesses and their critic. One witness names the\nstars 'Great Bear'; one calls them 'Charles's Wain'; one calls them the\n'Dipper.' Which human addition has made the best universe of the given\nstellar material? If Frederick Myers were the critic, he would have no\nhesitation in 'turning-down' the American witness.\nLotze has in several places made a deep suggestion. We naively assume,\nhe says, a relation between reality and our minds which may be just the\nopposite of the true one. Reality, we naturally think, stands ready-made\nand complete, and our intellects supervene with the one simple duty\nof describing it as it is already. But may not our descriptions, Lotze\nasks, be themselves important additions to reality? And may not previous\nreality itself be there, far less for the purpose of reappearing\nunaltered in our knowledge, than for the very purpose of stimulating\nour minds to such additions as shall enhance the universe's total value.\n\"Die erhohung des vorgefundenen daseins\" is a phrase used by Professor\nEucken somewhere, which reminds one of this suggestion by the great\nLotze.\nIt is identically our pragmatistic conception. In our cognitive as well\nas in our active life we are creative. We ADD, both to the subject and\nto the predicate part of reality. The world stands really malleable,\nwaiting to receive its final touches at our hands. Like the kingdom of\nheaven, it suffers human violence willingly. Man ENGENDERS truths upon\nit.\nNo one can deny that such a role would add both to our dignity and to\nour responsibility as thinkers. To some of us it proves a most inspiring\nnotion. Signer Papini, the leader of italian pragmatism, grows fairly\ndithyrambic over the view that it opens, of man's divinely-creative\nfunctions.\nThe import of the difference between pragmatism and rationalism is now\nin sight throughout its whole extent. The essential contrast is that for\nrationalism reality is ready-made and complete from all eternity,\nwhile for pragmatism it is still in the making, and awaits part of its\ncomplexion from the future. On the one side the universe is absolutely\nsecure, on the other it is still pursuing its adventures.\nWe have got into rather deep water with this humanistic view, and it is\nno wonder that misunderstanding gathers round it. It is accused of being\na doctrine of caprice. Mr. Bradley, for example, says that a humanist,\nif he understood his own doctrine, would have to \"hold any end however\nperverted to be rational if I insist on it personally, and any idea\nhowever mad to be the truth if only some one is resolved that he will\nhave it so.\" The humanist view of 'reality,' as something resisting, yet\nmalleable, which controls our thinking as an energy that must be\ntaken 'account' of incessantly (tho not necessarily merely COPIED) is\nevidently a difficult one to introduce to novices. The situation reminds\nme of one that I have personally gone through. I once wrote an essay on\nour right to believe, which I unluckily called the WILL to Believe.\nAll the critics, neglecting the essay, pounced upon the title.\nPsychologically it was impossible, morally it was iniquitous. The\n\"will to deceive,\" the \"will to make-believe,\" were wittily proposed as\nsubstitutes for it.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN PRAGMATISM AND RATIONALISM, IN THE SHAPE IN\nWHICH WE NOW HAVE IT BEFORE US, IS NO LONGER A QUESTION IN THE THEORY OF\nKNOWLEDGE, IT CONCERNS THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF.\nOn the pragmatist side we have only one edition of the universe,\nunfinished, growing in all sorts of places, especially in the places\nwhere thinking beings are at work.\nOn the rationalist side we have a universe in many editions, one real\none, the infinite folio, or edition de luxe, eternally complete; and\nthen the various finite editions, full of false readings, distorted and\nmutilated each in its own way.\nSo the rival metaphysical hypotheses of pluralism and monism here come\nback upon us. I will develope their differences during the remainder of\nour hour.\nAnd first let me say that it is impossible not to see a temperamental\ndifference at work in the choice of sides. The rationalist mind,\nradically taken, is of a doctrinaire and authoritative complexion: the\nphrase 'must be' is ever on its lips. The belly-band of its\nuniverse must be tight. A radical pragmatist on the other hand is a\nhappy-go-lucky anarchistic sort of creature. If he had to live in a tub\nlike Diogenes he wouldn't mind at all if the hoops were loose and the\nstaves let in the sun.\nNow the idea of this loose universe affects your typical rationalists\nin much the same way as 'freedom of the press' might affect a veteran\nofficial in the russian bureau of censorship; or as 'simplified\nspelling' might affect an elderly schoolmistress. It affects him as\nthe swarm of protestant sects affects a papist onlooker. It appears\nas backboneless and devoid of principle as 'opportunism' in politics\nappears to an old-fashioned french legitimist, or to a fanatical\nbeliever in the divine right of the people.\nFor pluralistic pragmatism, truth grows up inside of all the finite\nexperiences. They lean on each other, but the whole of them, if such a\nwhole there be, leans on nothing. All 'homes' are in finite experience;\nfinite experience as such is homeless. Nothing outside of the flux\nsecures the issue of it. It can hope salvation only from its own\nintrinsic promises and potencies.\nTo rationalists this describes a tramp and vagrant world, adrift in\nspace, with neither elephant nor tortoise to plant the sole of its foot\nupon. It is a set of stars hurled into heaven without even a centre of\ngravity to pull against. In other spheres of life it is true that we\nhave got used to living in a state of relative insecurity. The authority\nof 'the State,' and that of an absolute 'moral law,' have resolved\nthemselves into expediencies, and holy church has resolved itself into\n'meeting-houses.' Not so as yet within the philosophic class-rooms.\nA universe with such as US contributing to create its truth, a world\ndelivered to OUR opportunisms and OUR private judgments! Home-rule for\nIreland would be a millennium in comparison. We're no more fit for such\na part than the Filipinos are 'fit for self-government.' Such a world\nwould not be RESPECTABLE, philosophically. It is a trunk without a tag,\na dog without a collar, in the eyes of most professors of philosophy.\nWhat then would tighten this loose universe, according to the\nprofessors?\nSomething to support the finite many, to tie it to, to unify and anchor\nit. Something unexposed to accident, something eternal and unalterable.\nThe mutable in experience must be founded on immutability. Behind our de\nfacto world, our world in act, there must be a de jure duplicate fixed\nand previous, with all that can happen here already there in posse,\nevery drop of blood, every smallest item, appointed and provided,\nstamped and branded, without chance of variation. The negatives that\nhaunt our ideals here below must be themselves negated in the absolutely\nReal. This alone makes the universe solid. This is the resting deep.\nWe live upon the stormy surface; but with this our anchor holds, for it\ngrapples rocky bottom. This is Wordsworth's \"central peace subsisting at\nthe heart of endless agitation.\" This is Vivekananda's mystical One of\nwhich I read to you. This is Reality with the big R, reality that makes\nthe timeless claim, reality to which defeat can't happen. This is\nwhat the men of principles, and in general all the men whom I called\ntender-minded in my first lecture, think themselves obliged to\npostulate.\nAnd this, exactly this, is what the tough-minded of that lecture find\nthemselves moved to call a piece of perverse abstraction-worship. The\ntough-minded are the men whose alpha and omega are FACTS. Behind the\nbare phenomenal facts, as my tough-minded old friend Chauncey Wright,\nthe great Harvard empiricist of my youth, used to say, there is NOTHING.\nWhen a rationalist insists that behind the facts there is the GROUND of\nthe facts, the POSSIBILITY of the facts, the tougher empiricists accuse\nhim of taking the mere name and nature of a fact and clapping it behind\nthe fact as a duplicate entity to make it possible. That such sham\ngrounds are often invoked is notorious. At a surgical operation I heard\na bystander ask a doctor why the patient breathed so deeply. \"Because\nether is a respiratory stimulant,\" the doctor answered. \"Ah!\" said the\nquestioner, as if relieved by the explanation. But this is like saying\nthat cyanide of potassium kills because it is a 'poison,' or that it is\nso cold to-night because it is 'winter,' or that we have five fingers\nbecause we are 'pentadactyls.' These are but names for the facts,\ntaken from the facts, and then treated as previous and explanatory.\nThe tender-minded notion of an absolute reality is, according to the\nradically tough-minded, framed on just this pattern. It is but our\nsummarizing name for the whole spread-out and strung-along mass of\nphenomena, treated as if it were a different entity, both one and\nprevious.\nYou see how differently people take things. The world we live in exists\ndiffused and distributed, in the form of an indefinitely numerous lot of\neaches, coherent in all sorts of ways and degrees; and the tough-minded\nare perfectly willing to keep them at that valuation. They can stand\nthat kind of world, their temper being well adapted to its insecurity.\nNot so the tender-minded party. They must back the world we find\nourselves born into by \"another and a better\" world in which the eaches\nform an All and the All a One that logically presupposes, co-implicates,\nand secures each EACH without exception.\nMust we as pragmatists be radically tough-minded? or can we treat\nthe absolute edition of the world as a legitimate hypothesis? It is\ncertainly legitimate, for it is thinkable, whether we take it in its\nabstract or in its concrete shape.\nBy taking it abstractly I mean placing it behind our finite life as we\nplace the word 'winter' behind to-night's cold weather. 'Winter' is\nonly the name for a certain number of days which we find generally\ncharacterized by cold weather, but it guarantees nothing in that line,\nfor our thermometer to-morrow may soar into the 70's. Nevertheless\nthe word is a useful one to plunge forward with into the stream of our\nexperience. It cuts off certain probabilities and sets up others: you\ncan put away your straw-hats; you can unpack your arctics. It is a\nsummary of things to look for. It names a part of nature's habits,\nand gets you ready for their continuation. It is a definite instrument\nabstracted from experience, a conceptual reality that you must take\naccount of, and which reflects you totally back into sensible\nrealities. The pragmatist is the last person to deny the reality of such\nabstractions. They are so much past experience funded.\nBut taking the absolute edition of the world concretely means a\ndifferent hypothesis. Rationalists take it concretely and OPPOSE it to\nthe world's finite editions. They give it a particular nature. It is\nperfect, finished. Everything known there is known along with everything\nelse; here, where ignorance reigns, far otherwise. If there is want\nthere, there also is the satisfaction provided. Here all is process;\nthat world is timeless. Possibilities obtain in our world; in the\nabsolute world, where all that is NOT is from eternity impossible,\nand all that IS is necessary, the category of possibility has no\napplication. In this world crimes and horrors are regrettable. In that\ntotalized world regret obtains not, for \"the existence of ill in the\ntemporal order is the very condition of the perfection of the eternal\norder.\"\nOnce more, either hypothesis is legitimate in pragmatist eyes, for\neither has its uses. Abstractly, or taken like the word winter, as a\nmemorandum of past experience that orients us towards the future, the\nnotion of the absolute world is indispensable. Concretely taken, it is\nalso indispensable, at least to certain minds, for it determines them\nreligiously, being often a thing to change their lives by, and by\nchanging their lives, to change whatever in the outer order depends on\nthem.\nWe cannot therefore methodically join the tough minds in their rejection\nof the whole notion of a world beyond our finite experience. One\nmisunderstanding of pragmatism is to identify it with positivistic\ntough-mindedness, to suppose that it scorns every rationalistic notion\nas so much jabber and gesticulation, that it loves intellectual anarchy\nas such and prefers a sort of wolf-world absolutely unpent and wild\nand without a master or a collar to any philosophic class-room\nproduct, whatsoever. I have said so much in these lectures against\nthe over-tender forms of rationalism, that I am prepared for some\nmisunderstanding here, but I confess that the amount of it that I have\nfound in this very audience surprises me, for I have simultaneously\ndefended rationalistic hypotheses so far as these re-direct you\nfruitfully into experience.\nFor instance I receive this morning this question on a post-card: \"Is a\npragmatist necessarily a complete materialist and agnostic?\" One of my\noldest friends, who ought to know me better, writes me a letter that\naccuses the pragmatism I am recommending, of shutting out all wider\nmetaphysical views and condemning us to the most terre-a-terre\nnaturalism. Let me read you some extracts from it.\n\"It seems to me,\" my friend writes, \"that the pragmatic objection to\npragmatism lies in the fact that it might accentuate the narrowness of\nnarrow minds.\n\"Your call to the rejection of the namby-pamby and the wishy-washy is of\ncourse inspiring. But although it is salutary and stimulating to be told\nthat one should be responsible for the immediate issues and bearings\nof his words and thoughts, I decline to be deprived of the pleasure and\nprofit of dwelling also on remoter bearings and issues, and it is the\nTENDENCY of pragmatism to refuse this privilege.\n\"In short, it seems to me that the limitations, or rather the dangers,\nof the pragmatic tendency, are analogous to those which beset the unwary\nfollowers of the 'natural sciences.' Chemistry and physics are eminently\npragmatic and many of their devotees, smugly content with the data that\ntheir weights and measures furnish, feel an infinite pity and disdain\nfor all students of philosophy and meta-physics, whomsoever. And\nof course everything can be expressed--after a fashion, and\n'theoretically'--in terms of chemistry and physics, that is, EVERYTHING\nEXCEPT THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE, and that, they say, there is no\npragmatic use in trying to express; it has no bearings--FOR THEM. I for\nmy part refuse to be persuaded that we cannot look beyond the obvious\npluralism of the naturalist and the pragmatist to a logical unity in\nwhich they take no interest.\"\nHow is such a conception of the pragmatism I am advocating possible,\nafter my first and second lectures? I have all along been offering it\nexpressly as a mediator between tough-mindedness and tender-mindedness.\nIf the notion of a world ante rem, whether taken abstractly like the\nword winter, or concretely as the hypothesis of an Absolute, can be\nshown to have any consequences whatever for our life, it has a meaning.\nIf the meaning works, it will have SOME truth that ought to be held to\nthrough all possible reformulations, for pragmatism.\nThe absolutistic hypothesis, that perfection is eternal, aboriginal, and\nmost real, has a perfectly definite meaning, and it works religiously.\nTo examine how, will be the subject of my next and final lecture.\nLecture VIII\nPragmatism and Religion\nAt the close of the last lecture I reminded you of the first one,\nin which I had opposed tough-mindedness to tender-mindedness and\nrecommended pragmatism as their mediator. Tough-mindedness positively\nrejects tender-mindedness's hypothesis of an eternal perfect edition of\nthe universe coexisting with our finite experience.\nOn pragmatic principles we cannot reject any hypothesis if consequences\nuseful to life flow from it. Universal conceptions, as things to take\naccount of, may be as real for pragmatism as particular sensations are.\nThey have indeed no meaning and no reality if they have no use. But if\nthey have any use they have that amount of meaning. And the meaning will\nbe true if the use squares well with life's other uses.\nWell, the use of the Absolute is proved by the whole course of\nmen's religious history. The eternal arms are then beneath. Remember\nVivekananda's use of the Atman: it is indeed not a scientific use,\nfor we can make no particular deductions from it. It is emotional and\nspiritual altogether.\nIt is always best to discuss things by the help of concrete examples.\nLet me read therefore some of those verses entitled \"To You\" by Walt\nWhitman--\"You\" of course meaning the reader or hearer of the poem\nwhosoever he or she may be.\nWhoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my poem; I\nwhisper with my lips close to your ear, I have loved many women and men,\nbut I love none better than you.\nO I have been dilatory and dumb; I should have made my way straight\nto you long ago; I should have blabb'd nothing but you, I should have\nchanted nothing but you.\nI will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you; None have\nunderstood you, but I understand you; None have done justice to you--you\nhave not done justice to yourself; None but have found you imperfect--I\nonly find no imperfection in you.\nO I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you! You have not known\nwhat you are--you have slumber'd upon yourself all your life; What you\nhave done returns already in mockeries.\nBut the mockeries are not you; Underneath them, and within them, I see\nyou lurk; I pursue you where none else has pursued you; Silence, the\ndesk, the flippant expression, the night, the accustom'd routine, if\nthese conceal you from others, or from yourself, they do not conceal you\nfrom me; The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if\nthese balk others, they do not balk me, The pert apparel, the deform'd\nattitude, drunkenness, greed, premature death, all these I part aside.\nThere is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you; There\nis no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in you; No\npluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you; No pleasure\nwaiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you.\nWhoever you are! claim your own at any hazard! These shows of the\neast and west are tame, compared to you; These immense meadows--these\ninterminable rivers--you are immense and interminable as they; You are\nhe or she who is master or mistress over them, Master or mistress in\nyour own right over Nature, elements, pain, passion, dissolution.\nThe hopples fall from your ankles--you find an unfailing sufficiency;\nOld or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever\nyou are promulges itself; Through birth, life, death, burial, the means\nare provided, nothing is scanted; Through angers, losses, ambition,\nignorance, ennui, what you are picks its way.\nVerily a fine and moving poem, in any case, but there are two ways of\ntaking it, both useful.\nOne is the monistic way, the mystical way of pure cosmic emotion. The\nglories and grandeurs, they are yours absolutely, even in the midst of\nyour defacements. Whatever may happen to you, whatever you may appear to\nbe, inwardly you are safe. Look back, LIE back, on your true principle\nof being! This is the famous way of quietism, of indifferentism. Its\nenemies compare it to a spiritual opium. Yet pragmatism must respect\nthis way, for it has massive historic vindication.\nBut pragmatism sees another way to be respected also, the pluralistic\nway of interpreting the poem. The you so glorified, to which the hymn\nis sung, may mean your better possibilities phenomenally taken, or the\nspecific redemptive effects even of your failures, upon yourself or\nothers. It may mean your loyalty to the possibilities of others whom you\nadmire and love so, that you are willing to accept your own poor life,\nfor it is that glory's partner. You can at least appreciate, applaud,\nfurnish the audience, of so brave a total world. Forget the low in\nyourself, then, think only of the high. Identify your life therewith;\nthen, through angers, losses, ignorance, ennui, whatever you thus make\nyourself, whatever you thus most deeply are, picks its way.\nIn either way of taking the poem, it encourages fidelity to ourselves.\nBoth ways satisfy; both sanctify the human flux. Both paint the portrait\nof the YOU on a gold-background. But the background of the first way\nis the static One, while in the second way it means possibles in the\nplural, genuine possibles, and it has all the restlessness of that\nconception.\nNoble enough is either way of reading the poem; but plainly the\npluralistic way agrees with the pragmatic temper best, for it\nimmediately suggests an infinitely larger number of the details of\nfuture experience to our mind. It sets definite activities in us at\nwork. Altho this second way seems prosaic and earthborn in comparison\nwith the first way, yet no one can accuse it of tough-mindedness in any\nbrutal sense of the term. Yet if, as pragmatists, you should positively\nset up the second way AGAINST the first way, you would very likely be\nmisunderstood. You would be accused of denying nobler conceptions, and\nof being an ally of tough-mindedness in the worst sense.\nYou remember the letter from a member of this audience from which I read\nsome extracts at our previous meeting. Let me read you an additional\nextract now. It shows a vagueness in realizing the alternatives before\nus which I think is very widespread.\n\"I believe,\" writes my friend and correspondent, \"in pluralism; I\nbelieve that in our search for truth we leap from one floating cake of\nice to another, on an infinite sea, and that by each of our acts we make\nnew truths possible and old ones impossible; I believe that each man is\nresponsible for making the universe better, and that if he does not do\nthis it will be in so far left undone.\n\"Yet at the same time I am willing to endure that my children should be\nincurably sick and suffering (as they are not) and I myself stupid\nand yet with brains enough to see my stupidity, only on one condition,\nnamely, that through the construction, in imagination and by reasoning,\nof a RATIONAL UNITY OF ALL THINGS, I can conceive my acts and my\nthoughts and my troubles as SUPPLEMENTED: BY ALL THE OTHER PHENOMENA\nOF THE WORLD, AND AS FORMING--WHEN THUS SUPPLEMENTED--A SCHEME WHICH I\nAPPROVE AND ADOPT AS MY I OWN; and for my part I refuse to be persuaded\nthat we cannot look beyond the obvious pluralism of the naturalist and\npragmatist to a logical unity in which they take no interest or stock.\"\nSuch a fine expression of personal faith warms the heart of the hearer.\nBut how much does it clear his philosophic head? Does the writer\nconsistently favor the monistic, or the pluralistic, interpretation of\nthe world's poem? His troubles become atoned for WHEN THUS SUPPLEMENTED,\nhe says, supplemented, that is, by all the remedies that THE OTHER\nPHENOMENA may supply. Obviously here the writer faces forward into\nthe particulars of experience, which he interprets in a\npluralistic-melioristic way.\nBut he believes himself to face backward. He speaks of what he calls\nthe rational UNITY of things, when all the while he really means their\npossible empirical UNIFICATION. He supposes at the same time that the\npragmatist, because he criticizes rationalism's abstract One, is cut\noff from the consolation of believing in the saving possibilities of\nthe concrete many. He fails in short to distinguish between taking the\nworld's perfection as a necessary principle, and taking it only as a\npossible terminus ad quem.\nI regard the writer of this letter as a genuine pragmatist, but as a\npragmatist sans le savoir. He appears to me as one of that numerous\nclass of philosophic amateurs whom I spoke of in my first lecture, as\nwishing to have all the good things going, without being too careful\nas to how they agree or disagree. \"Rational unity of all things\" is\nso inspiring a formula, that he brandishes it offhand, and abstractly\naccuses pluralism of conflicting with it (for the bare names do\nconflict), altho concretely he means by it just the pragmatistically\nunified and ameliorated world. Most of us remain in this essential\nvagueness, and it is well that we should; but in the interest of\nclear-headedness it is well that some of us should go farther, so I\nwill try now to focus a little more discriminatingly on this particular\nreligious point.\nIs then this you of yous, this absolutely real world, this unity that\nyields the moral inspiration and has the religious value, to be taken\nmonistically or pluralistically? Is it ante rem or in rebus? Is it a\nprinciple or an end, an absolute or an ultimate, a first or a last? Does\nit make you look forward or lie back? It is certainly worth while not to\nclump the two things together, for if discriminated, they have decidedly\ndiverse meanings for life.\nPlease observe that the whole dilemma revolves pragmatically about the\nnotion of the world's possibilities. Intellectually, rationalism invokes\nits absolute principle of unity as a ground of possibility for the\nmany facts. Emotionally, it sees it as a container and limiter of\npossibilities, a guarantee that the upshot shall be good. Taken in this\nway, the absolute makes all good things certain, and all bad things\nimpossible (in the eternal, namely), and may be said to transmute the\nentire category of possibility into categories more secure. One sees at\nthis point that the great religious difference lies between the men who\ninsist that the world MUST AND SHALL BE, and those who are contented\nwith believing that the world MAY BE, saved. The whole clash of\nrationalistic and empiricist religion is thus over the validity of\npossibility. It is necessary therefore to begin by focusing upon that\nword. What may the word 'possible' definitely mean?\nTo unreflecting men the possible means a sort of third estate of being,\nless real than existence, more real than non-existence, a twilight\nrealm, a hybrid status, a limbo into which and out of which realities\never and anon are made to pass. Such a conception is of course too\nvague and nondescript to satisfy us. Here, as elsewhere, the only way to\nextract a term's meaning is to use the pragmatic method on it. When you\nsay that a thing is possible, what difference does it make?\nIt makes at least this difference that if anyone calls it impossible you\ncan contradict him, if anyone calls it actual you can contradict HIM,\nand if anyone calls it necessary you can contradict him too. But these\nprivileges of contradiction don't amount to much. When you say a thing\nis possible, does not that make some farther difference in terms of\nactual fact?\nIt makes at least this negative difference that if the statement be\ntrue, it follows that there is nothing extant capable of preventing the\npossible thing. The absence of real grounds of interference may thus be\nsaid to make things not impossible, possible therefore in the bare or\nabstract sense.\nBut most possibles are not bare, they are concretely grounded, or\nwell-grounded, as we say. What does this mean pragmatically? It means,\nnot only that there are no preventive conditions present, but that some\nof the conditions of production of the possible thing actually are here.\nThus a concretely possible chicken means: (1) that the idea of chicken\ncontains no essential self-contradiction; (2) that no boys, skunks, or\nother enemies are about; and (3) that at least an actual egg exists.\nPossible chicken means actual egg--plus actual sitting hen, or\nincubator, or what not. As the actual conditions approach completeness\nthe chicken becomes a better-and-better-grounded possibility. When the\nconditions are entirely complete, it ceases to be a possibility, and\nturns into an actual fact.\nLet us apply this notion to the salvation of the world. What does it\npragmatically mean to say that this is possible? It means that some of\nthe conditions of the world's deliverance do actually exist. The more of\nthem there are existent, the fewer preventing conditions you can find,\nthe better-grounded is the salvation's possibility, the more PROBABLE\ndoes the fact of the deliverance become.\nSo much for our preliminary look at possibility.\nNow it would contradict the very spirit of life to say that our minds\nmust be indifferent and neutral in questions like that of the world's\nsalvation. Anyone who pretends to be neutral writes himself down here\nas a fool and a sham. We all do wish to minimize the insecurity of the\nuniverse; we are and ought to be unhappy when we regard it as exposed to\nevery enemy and open to every life-destroying draft. Nevertheless there\nare unhappy men who think the salvation of the world impossible. Theirs\nis the doctrine known as pessimism.\nOptimism in turn would be the doctrine that thinks the world's salvation\ninevitable.\nMidway between the two there stands what may be called the doctrine of\nmeliorism, tho it has hitherto figured less as a doctrine than as an\nattitude in human affairs. Optimism has always been the regnant DOCTRINE\nin european philosophy. Pessimism was only recently introduced by\nSchopenhauer and counts few systematic defenders as yet. Meliorism\ntreats salvation as neither inevitable nor impossible. It treats it as\na possibility, which becomes more and more of a probability the more\nnumerous the actual conditions of salvation become.\nIt is clear that pragmatism must incline towards meliorism. Some\nconditions of the world's salvation are actually extant, and she cannot\npossibly close her eyes to this fact: and should the residual conditions\ncome, salvation would become an accomplished reality. Naturally the\nterms I use here are exceedingly summary. You may interpret the\nword 'salvation' in any way you like, and make it as diffuse and\ndistributive, or as climacteric and integral a phenomenon as you please.\nTake, for example, any one of us in this room with the ideals which\nhe cherishes, and is willing to live and work for. Every such ideal\nrealized will be one moment in the world's salvation. But these\nparticular ideals are not bare abstract possibilities. They are\ngrounded, they are LIVE possibilities, for we are their live champions\nand pledges, and if the complementary conditions come and add\nthemselves, our ideals will become actual things. What now are the\ncomplementary conditions? They are first such a mixture of things as\nwill in the fulness of time give us a chance, a gap that we can spring\ninto, and, finally, OUR ACT.\nDoes our act then CREATE the world's salvation so far as it makes room\nfor itself, so far as it leaps into the gap? Does it create, not the\nwhole world's salvation of course, but just so much of this as itself\ncovers of the world's extent?\nHere I take the bull by the horns, and in spite of the whole crew of\nrationalists and monists, of whatever brand they be, I ask WHY NOT? Our\nacts, our turning-places, where we seem to ourselves to make ourselves\nand grow, are the parts of the world to which we are closest, the parts\nof which our knowledge is the most intimate and complete. Why should\nwe not take them at their face-value? Why may they not be the actual\nturning-places and growing-places which they seem to be, of the\nworld--why not the workshop of being, where we catch fact in the making,\nso that nowhere may the world grow in any other kind of way than this?\nIrrational! we are told. How can new being come in local spots and\npatches which add themselves or stay away at random, independently of\nthe rest? There must be a reason for our acts, and where in the last\nresort can any reason be looked for save in the material pressure or the\nlogical compulsion of the total nature of the world? There can be but\none real agent of growth, or seeming growth, anywhere, and that agent is\nthe integral world itself. It may grow all-over, if growth there be, but\nthat single parts should grow per se is irrational.\nBut if one talks of rationality and of reasons for things, and insists\nthat they can't just come in spots, what KIND of a reason can there\nultimately be why anything should come at all? Talk of logic and\nnecessity and categories and the absolute and the contents of the whole\nphilosophical machine-shop as you will, the only REAL reason I can think\nof why anything should ever come is that someone wishes it to be here.\nIt is DEMANDED, demanded, it may be, to give relief to no matter\nhow small a fraction of the world's mass. This is living reason, and\ncompared with it material causes and logical necessities are spectral\nthings.\nIn short the only fully rational world would be the world of\nwishing-caps, the world of telepathy, where every desire is fulfilled\ninstanter, without having to consider or placate surrounding or\nintermediate powers. This is the Absolute's own world. He calls upon the\nphenomenal world to be, and it IS, exactly as he calls for it, no other\ncondition being required. In our world, the wishes of the individual are\nonly one condition. Other individuals are there with other wishes\nand they must be propitiated first. So Being grows under all sorts\nof resistances in this world of the many, and, from compromise to\ncompromise, only gets organized gradually into what may be called\nsecondarily rational shape. We approach the wishing-cap type of\norganization only in a few departments of life. We want water and we\nturn a faucet. We want a kodak-picture and we press a button. We want\ninformation and we telephone. We want to travel and we buy a ticket. In\nthese and similar cases, we hardly need to do more than the wishing--the\nworld is rationally organized to do the rest.\nBut this talk of rationality is a parenthesis and a digression. What\nwe were discussing was the idea of a world growing not integrally but\npiecemeal by the contributions of its several parts. Take the hypothesis\nseriously and as a live one. Suppose that the world's author put the\ncase to you before creation, saying: \"I am going to make a world\nnot certain to be saved, a world the perfection of which shall be\nconditional merely, the condition being that each several agent does its\nown 'level best.' I offer you the chance of taking part in such a world.\nIts safety, you see, is unwarranted. It is a real adventure, with real\ndanger, yet it may win through. It is a social scheme of co-operative\nwork genuinely to be done. Will you join the procession? Will you trust\nyourself and trust the other agents enough to face the risk?\"\nShould you in all seriousness, if participation in such a world were\nproposed to you, feel bound to reject it as not safe enough? Would you\nsay that, rather than be part and parcel of so fundamentally pluralistic\nand irrational a universe, you preferred to relapse into the slumber of\nnonentity from which you had been momentarily aroused by the tempter's\nvoice?\nOf course if you are normally constituted, you would do nothing of the\nsort. There is a healthy-minded buoyancy in most of us which such a\nuniverse would exactly fit. We would therefore accept the offer--\"Top!\nund schlag auf schlag!\" It would be just like the world we practically\nlive in; and loyalty to our old nurse Nature would forbid us to say no.\nThe world proposed would seem 'rational' to us in the most living way.\nMost of us, I say, would therefore welcome the proposition and add our\nfiat to the fiat of the creator. Yet perhaps some would not; for there\nare morbid minds in every human collection, and to them the prospect of\na universe with only a fighting chance of safety would probably make no\nappeal. There are moments of discouragement in us all, when we are sick\nof self and tired of vainly striving. Our own life breaks down, and we\nfall into the attitude of the prodigal son. We mistrust the chances\nof things. We want a universe where we can just give up, fall on our\nfather's neck, and be absorbed into the absolute life as a drop of water\nmelts into the river or the sea.\nThe peace and rest, the security desiderated at such moments is security\nagainst the bewildering accidents of so much finite experience. Nirvana\nmeans safety from this everlasting round of adventures of which the\nworld of sense consists. The hindoo and the buddhist, for this\nis essentially their attitude, are simply afraid, afraid of more\nexperience, afraid of life.\nAnd to men of this complexion, religious monism comes with its consoling\nwords: \"All is needed and essential--even you with your sick soul and\nheart. All are one with God, and with God all is well. The everlasting\narms are beneath, whether in the world of finite appearances you seem to\nfail or to succeed.\" There can be no doubt that when men are reduced\nto their last sick extremity absolutism is the only saving scheme.\nPluralistic moralism simply makes their teeth chatter, it refrigerates\nthe very heart within their breast.\nSo we see concretely two types of religion in sharp contrast. Using our\nold terms of comparison, we may say that the absolutistic scheme appeals\nto the tender-minded while the pluralistic scheme appeals to the tough.\nMany persons would refuse to call the pluralistic scheme religious at\nall. They would call it moralistic, and would apply the word religious\nto the monistic scheme alone. Religion in the sense of self-surrender,\nand moralism in the sense of self-sufficingness, have been pitted\nagainst each other as incompatibles frequently enough in the history of\nhuman thought.\nWe stand here before the final question of philosophy. I said in my\nfourth lecture that I believed the monistic-pluralistic alternative to\nbe the deepest and most pregnant question that our minds can frame. Can\nit be that the disjunction is a final one? that only one side can be\ntrue? Are a pluralism and monism genuine incompatibles? So that, if\nthe world were really pluralistically constituted, if it really existed\ndistributively and were made up of a lot of eaches, it could only be\nsaved piecemeal and de facto as the result of their behavior, and its\nepic history in no wise short-circuited by some essential oneness in\nwhich the severalness were already 'taken up' beforehand and eternally\n'overcome'? If this were so, we should have to choose one philosophy or\nthe other. We could not say 'yes, yes' to both alternatives. There would\nhave to be a 'no' in our relations with the possible. We should confess\nan ultimate disappointment: we could not remain healthy-minded and\nsick-minded in one indivisible act.\nOf course as human beings we can be healthy minds on one day and sick\nsouls on the next; and as amateur dabblers in philosophy we may\nperhaps be allowed to call ourselves monistic pluralists, or free-will\ndeterminists, or whatever else may occur to us of a reconciling kind.\nBut as philosophers aiming at clearness and consistency, and feeling the\npragmatistic need of squaring truth with truth, the question is forced\nupon us of frankly adopting either the tender or the robustious type of\nthought. In particular THIS query has always come home to me: May not\nthe claims of tender-mindedness go too far? May not the notion of a\nworld already saved in toto anyhow, be too saccharine to stand? May not\nreligious optimism be too idyllic? Must ALL be saved? Is NO price to be\npaid in the work of salvation? Is the last word sweet? Is all 'yes,\nyes' in the universe? Doesn't the fact of 'no' stand at the very core of\nlife? Doesn't the very 'seriousness' that we attribute to life mean that\nineluctable noes and losses form a part of it, that there are genuine\nsacrifices somewhere, and that something permanently drastic and bitter\nalways remains at the bottom of its cup?\nI can not speak officially as a pragmatist here; all I can say is that\nmy own pragmatism offers no objection to my taking sides with this more\nmoralistic view, and giving up the claim of total reconciliation. The\npossibility of this is involved in the pragmatistic willingness to treat\npluralism as a serious hypothesis. In the end it is our faith and not\nour logic that decides such questions, and I deny the right of any\npretended logic to veto my own faith. I find myself willing to take\nthe universe to be really dangerous and adventurous, without therefore\nbacking out and crying 'no play.' I am willing to think that the\nprodigal-son attitude, open to us as it is in many vicissitudes, is not\nthe right and final attitude towards the whole of life. I am willing\nthat there should be real losses and real losers, and no total\npreservation of all that is. I can believe in the ideal as an ultimate,\nnot as an origin, and as an extract, not the whole. When the cup is\npoured off, the dregs are left behind forever, but the possibility of\nwhat is poured off is sweet enough to accept.\nAs a matter of fact countless human imaginations live in this moralistic\nand epic kind of a universe, and find its disseminated and strung-along\nsuccesses sufficient for their rational needs. There is a finely\ntranslated epigram in the greek anthology which admirably expresses this\nstate of mind, this acceptance of loss as unatoned for, even tho the\nlost element might be one's self:\n\"A shipwrecked sailor, buried on this coast, Bids you set sail. Full\nmany a gallant bark, when we were lost, Weathered the gale.\"\nThose puritans who answered 'yes' to the question: Are you willing to be\ndamned for God's glory? were in this objective and magnanimous condition\nof mind. The way of escape from evil on this system is NOT by getting\nit 'aufgehoben,' or preserved in the whole as an element essential but\n'overcome.' It is by dropping it out altogether, throwing it overboard\nand getting beyond it, helping to make a universe that shall forget its\nvery place and name.\nIt is then perfectly possible to accept sincerely a drastic kind of a\nuniverse from which the element of 'seriousness' is not to be expelled.\nWhoso does so is, it seems to me, a genuine pragmatist. He is willing to\nlive on a scheme of uncertified possibilities which he trusts; willing\nto pay with his own person, if need be, for the realization of the\nideals which he frames.\nWhat now actually ARE the other forces which he trusts to co-operate\nwith him, in a universe of such a type? They are at least his fellow\nmen, in the stage of being which our actual universe has reached. But\nare there not superhuman forces also, such as religious men of the\npluralistic type we have been considering have always believed in? Their\nwords may have sounded monistic when they said \"there is no God but\nGod\"; but the original polytheism of mankind has only imperfectly and\nvaguely sublimated itself into monotheism, and monotheism itself, so far\nas it was religious and not a scheme of class-room instruction for the\nmetaphysicians, has always viewed God as but one helper, primus inter\npares, in the midst of all the shapers of the great world's fate.\nI fear that my previous lectures, confined as they have been to human\nand humanistic aspects, may have left the impression on many of you that\npragmatism means methodically to leave the superhuman out. I have shown\nsmall respect indeed for the Absolute, and I have until this moment\nspoken of no other superhuman hypothesis but that. But I trust that you\nsee sufficiently that the Absolute has nothing but its superhumanness\nin common with the theistic God. On pragmatistic principles, if the\nhypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word,\nit is true. Now whatever its residual difficulties may be, experience\nshows that it certainly does work, and that the problem is to build it\nout and determine it, so that it will combine satisfactorily with all\nthe other working truths. I cannot start upon a whole theology at the\nend of this last lecture; but when I tell you that I have written a book\non men's religious experience, which on the whole has been regarded as\nmaking for the reality of God, you will perhaps exempt my own pragmatism\nfrom the charge of being an atheistic system. I firmly disbelieve,\nmyself, that our human experience is the highest form of experience\nextant in the universe. I believe rather that we stand in much the same\nrelation to the whole of the universe as our canine and feline pets\ndo to the whole of human life. They inhabit our drawing-rooms and\nlibraries. They take part in scenes of whose significance they have no\ninkling. They are merely tangent to curves of history the beginnings and\nends and forms of which pass wholly beyond their ken. So we are tangents\nto the wider life of things. But, just as many of the dog's and cat's\nideals coincide with our ideals, and the dogs and cats have daily living\nproof of the fact, so we may well believe, on the proofs that religious\nexperience affords, that higher powers exist and are at work to save the\nworld on ideal lines similar to our own.\nYou see that pragmatism can be called religious, if you allow that\nreligion can be pluralistic or merely melioristic in type. But whether\nyou will finally put up with that type of religion or not is a question\nthat only you yourself can decide. Pragmatism has to postpone dogmatic\nanswer, for we do not yet know certainly which type of religion is going\nto work best in the long run. The various overbeliefs of men, their\nseveral faith-ventures, are in fact what are needed to bring the\nevidence in. You will probably make your own ventures severally. If\nradically tough, the hurly-burly of the sensible facts of nature will\nbe enough for you, and you will need no religion at all. If radically\ntender, you will take up with the more monistic form of religion:\nthe pluralistic form, with its reliance on possibilities that are not\nnecessities, will not seem to afford you security enough.\nBut if you are neither tough nor tender in an extreme and radical\nsense, but mixed as most of us are, it may seem to you that the type\nof pluralistic and moralistic religion that I have offered is as good a\nreligious synthesis as you are likely to find. Between the two extremes\nof crude naturalism on the one hand and transcendental absolutism on\nthe other, you may find that what I take the liberty of calling the\npragmatistic or melioristic type of theism is exactly what you require.\nThe End", "source": "pragmatism.txt"}
{"text": "LECTURE I. RELIGION AND NEUROLOGY.\nIt is with no small amount of trepidation that I take my place behind this\ndesk, and face this learned audience. To us Americans, the experience of\nreceiving instruction from the living voice, as well as from the books, of\nEuropean scholars, is very familiar. At my own University of Harvard, not\na winter passes without its harvest, large or small, of lectures from\nScottish, English, French, or German representatives of the science or\nliterature of their respective countries whom we have either induced to\ncross the ocean to address us, or captured on the wing as they were\nvisiting our land. It seems the natural thing for us to listen whilst the\nEuropeans talk. The contrary habit, of talking whilst the Europeans\nlisten, we have not yet acquired; and in him who first makes the adventure\nit begets a certain sense of apology being due for so presumptuous an act.\nParticularly must this be the case on a soil as sacred to the American\nimagination as that of Edinburgh. The glories of the philosophic chair of\nthis university were deeply impressed on my imagination in boyhood.\nProfessor Fraser\u2019s Essays in Philosophy, then just published, was the\nfirst philosophic book I ever looked into, and I well remember the awe\u2010\nstruck feeling I received from the account of Sir William Hamilton\u2019s\nclass\u2010room therein contained. Hamilton\u2019s own lectures were the first\nphilosophic writings I ever forced myself to study, and after that I was\nimmersed in Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown. Such juvenile emotions of\nreverence never get outgrown; and I confess that to find my humble self\npromoted from my native wilderness to be actually for the time an official\nhere, and transmuted into a colleague of these illustrious names, carries\nwith it a sense of dreamland quite as much as of reality.\nBut since I have received the honor of this appointment I have felt that\nit would never do to decline. The academic career also has its heroic\nobligations, so I stand here without further deprecatory words. Let me say\nonly this, that now that the current, here and at Aberdeen, has begun to\nrun from west to east, I hope it may continue to do so. As the years go\nby, I hope that many of my countrymen may be asked to lecture in the\nScottish universities, changing places with Scotsmen lecturing in the\nUnited States; I hope that our people may become in all these higher\nmatters even as one people; and that the peculiar philosophic temperament,\nas well as the peculiar political temperament, that goes with our English\nspeech may more and more pervade and influence the world.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nAs regards the manner in which I shall have to administer this\nlectureship, I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the\nhistory of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch\nof learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the\nreligious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other\nof the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem,\ntherefore, that, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to\ninvite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities.\nIf the inquiry be psychological, not religious institutions, but rather\nreligious feelings and religious impulses must be its subject, and I must\nconfine myself to those more developed subjective phenomena recorded in\nliterature produced by articulate and fully self\u2010conscious men, in works\nof piety and autobiography. Interesting as the origins and early stages of\na subject always are, yet when one seeks earnestly for its full\nsignificance, one must always look to its more completely evolved and\nperfect forms. It follows from this that the documents that will most\nconcern us will be those of the men who were most accomplished in the\nreligious life and best able to give an intelligible account of their\nideas and motives. These men, of course, are either comparatively modern\nwriters, or else such earlier ones as have become religious classics. The\n_documents humains_ which we shall find most instructive need not then be\nsought for in the haunts of special erudition\u2014they lie along the beaten\nhighway; and this circumstance, which flows so naturally from the\ncharacter of our problem, suits admirably also your lecturer\u2019s lack of\nspecial theological learning. I may take my citations, my sentences and\nparagraphs of personal confession, from books that most of you at some\ntime will have had already in your hands, and yet this will be no\ndetriment to the value of my conclusions. It is true that some more\nadventurous reader and investigator, lecturing here in future, may unearth\nfrom the shelves of libraries documents that will make a more delectable\nand curious entertainment to listen to than mine. Yet I doubt whether he\nwill necessarily, by his control of so much more out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010way material,\nget much closer to the essence of the matter in hand.\nThe question, What are the religious propensities? and the question, What\nis their philosophic significance? are two entirely different orders of\nquestion from the logical point of view; and, as a failure to recognize\nthis fact distinctly may breed confusion, I wish to insist upon the point\na little before we enter into the documents and materials to which I have\nreferred.\nIn recent books on logic, distinction is made between two orders of\ninquiry concerning anything. First, what is the nature of it? how did it\ncome about? what is its constitution, origin, and history? And second,\nWhat is its importance, meaning, or significance, now that it is once\nhere? The answer to the one question is given in an _existential judgment_\nor proposition. The answer to the other is a _proposition of value_, what\nthe Germans call a _Werthurtheil_, or what we may, if we like, denominate\na _spiritual judgment_. Neither judgment can be deduced immediately from\nthe other. They proceed from diverse intellectual preoccupations, and the\nmind combines them only by making them first separately, and then adding\nthem together.\nIn the matter of religions it is particularly easy to distinguish the two\norders of question. Every religious phenomenon has its history and its\nderivation from natural antecedents. What is nowadays called the higher\ncriticism of the Bible is only a study of the Bible from this existential\npoint of view, neglected too much by the earlier church. Under just what\nbiographic conditions did the sacred writers bring forth their various\ncontributions to the holy volume? And what had they exactly in their\nseveral individual minds, when they delivered their utterances? These are\nmanifestly questions of historical fact, and one does not see how the\nanswer to them can decide offhand the still further question: of what use\nshould such a volume, with its manner of coming into existence so defined,\nbe to us as a guide to life and a revelation? To answer this other\nquestion we must have already in our mind some sort of a general theory as\nto what the peculiarities in a thing should be which give it value for\npurposes of revelation; and this theory itself would be what I just called\na spiritual judgment. Combining it with our existential judgment, we might\nindeed deduce another spiritual judgment as to the Bible\u2019s worth. Thus if\nour theory of revelation\u2010value were to affirm that any book, to possess\nit, must have been composed automatically or not by the free caprice of\nthe writer, or that it must exhibit no scientific and historic errors and\nexpress no local or personal passions, the Bible would probably fare ill\nat our hands. But if, on the other hand, our theory should allow that a\nbook may well be a revelation in spite of errors and passions and\ndeliberate human composition, if only it be a true record of the inner\nexperiences of great\u2010souled persons wrestling with the crises of their\nfate, then the verdict would be much more favorable. You see that the\nexistential facts by themselves are insufficient for determining the\nvalue; and the best adepts of the higher criticism accordingly never\nconfound the existential with the spiritual problem. With the same\nconclusions of fact before them, some take one view, and some another, of\nthe Bible\u2019s value as a revelation, according as their spiritual judgment\nas to the foundation of values differs.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI make these general remarks about the two sorts of judgment, because\nthere are many religious persons\u2014some of you now present, possibly, are\namong them\u2014who do not yet make a working use of the distinction, and who\nmay therefore feel at first a little startled at the purely existential\npoint of view from which in the following lectures the phenomena of\nreligious experience must be considered. When I handle them biologically\nand psychologically as if they were mere curious facts of individual\nhistory, some of you may think it a degradation of so sublime a subject,\nand may even suspect me, until my purpose gets more fully expressed, of\ndeliberately seeking to discredit the religious side of life.\nSuch a result is of course absolutely alien to my intention; and since\nsuch a prejudice on your part would seriously obstruct the due effect of\nmuch of what I have to relate, I will devote a few more words to the\npoint.\nThere can be no doubt that as a matter of fact a religious life,\nexclusively pursued, does tend to make the person exceptional and\neccentric. I speak not now of your ordinary religious believer, who\nfollows the conventional observances of his country, whether it be\nBuddhist, Christian, or Mohammedan. His religion has been made for him by\nothers, communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by\nimitation, and retained by habit. It would profit us little to study this\nsecond\u2010hand religious life. We must make search rather for the original\nexperiences which were the pattern\u2010setters to all this mass of suggested\nfeeling and imitated conduct. These experiences we can only find in\nindividuals for whom religion exists not as a dull habit, but as an acute\nfever rather. But such individuals are \u201cgeniuses\u201d in the religious line;\nand like many other geniuses who have brought forth fruits effective\nenough for commemoration in the pages of biography, such religious\ngeniuses have often shown symptoms of nervous instability. Even more\nperhaps than other kinds of genius, religious leaders have been subject to\nabnormal psychical visitations. Invariably they have been creatures of\nexalted emotional sensibility. Often they have led a discordant inner\nlife, and had melancholy during a part of their career. They have known no\nmeasure, been liable to obsessions and fixed ideas; and frequently they\nhave fallen into trances, heard voices, seen visions, and presented all\nsorts of peculiarities which are ordinarily classed as pathological.\nOften, moreover, these pathological features in their career have helped\nto give them their religious authority and influence.\nIf you ask for a concrete example, there can be no better one than is\nfurnished by the person of George Fox. The Quaker religion which he\nfounded is something which it is impossible to overpraise. In a day of\nshams, it was a religion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a\nreturn to something more like the original gospel truth than men had ever\nknown in England. So far as our Christian sects to\u2010day are evolving into\nliberality, they are simply reverting in essence to the position which Fox\nand the early Quakers so long ago assumed. No one can pretend for a moment\nthat in point of spiritual sagacity and capacity, Fox\u2019s mind was unsound.\nEvery one who confronted him personally, from Oliver Cromwell down to\ncounty magistrates and jailers, seems to have acknowledged his superior\npower. Yet from the point of view of his nervous constitution, Fox was a\npsychopath or _d\u00e9traqu\u00e9_ of the deepest dye. His Journal abounds in\nentries of this sort:\u2014\n\u201cAs I was walking with several friends, I lifted up my head, and\nsaw three steeple\u2010house spires, and they struck at my life. I\nasked them what place that was? They said, Lichfield. Immediately\nthe word of the Lord came to me, that I must go thither. Being\ncome to the house we were going to, I wished the friends to walk\ninto the house, saying nothing to them of whither I was to go. As\nsoon as they were gone I stept away, and went by my eye over hedge\nand ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield; where, in a\ngreat field, shepherds were keeping their sheep. Then was I\ncommanded by the Lord to pull off my shoes. I stood still, for it\nwas winter: but the word of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I\nput off my shoes, and left them with the shepherds; and the poor\nshepherds trembled, and were astonished. Then I walked on about a\nmile, and as soon as I was got within the city, the word of the\nLord came to me again, saying: Cry, \u2018Wo to the bloody city of\nLichfield!\u2019 So I went up and down the streets, crying with a loud\nvoice, Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield! It being market day, I\nwent into the market\u2010place, and to and fro in the several parts of\nit, and made stands, crying as before, Wo to the bloody city of\nLichfield! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus crying\nthrough the streets, there seemed to me to be a channel of blood\nrunning down the streets, and the market\u2010place appeared like a\npool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt\nmyself clear, I went out of the town in peace; and returning to\nthe shepherds gave them some money, and took my shoes of them\nagain. But the fire of the Lord was so on my feet, and all over\nme, that I did not matter to put on my shoes again, and was at a\nstand whether I should or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord so\nto do: then, after I had washed my feet, I put on my shoes again.\nAfter this a deep consideration came upon me, for what reason I\nshould be sent to cry against that city, and call it The bloody\ncity! For though the parliament had the minister one while, and\nthe king another, and much blood had been shed in the town during\nthe wars between them, yet there was no more than had befallen\nmany other places. But afterwards I came to understand, that in\nthe Emperor Diocletian\u2019s time a thousand Christians were martyr\u2019d\nin Lichfield. So I was to go, without my shoes, through the\nchannel of their blood, and into the pool of their blood in the\nmarket\u2010place, that I might raise up the memorial of the blood of\nthose martyrs, which had been shed above a thousand years before,\nand lay cold in their streets. So the sense of this blood was upon\nme, and I obeyed the word of the Lord.\u201d\nBent as we are on studying religion\u2019s existential conditions, we cannot\npossibly ignore these pathological aspects of the subject. We must\ndescribe and name them just as if they occurred in non\u2010religious men. It\nis true that we instinctively recoil from seeing an object to which our\nemotions and affections are committed handled by the intellect as any\nother object is handled. The first thing the intellect does with an object\nis to class it along with something else. But any object that is\ninfinitely important to us and awakens our devotion feels to us also as if\nit must be _sui generis_ and unique. Probably a crab would be filled with\na sense of personal outrage if it could hear us class it without ado or\napology as a crustacean, and thus dispose of it. \u201cI am no such thing,\u201d it\nwould say; \u201cI am MYSELF, MYSELF alone.\u201d\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next thing the intellect does is to lay bare the causes in which the\nthing originates. Spinoza says: \u201cI will analyze the actions and appetites\nof men as if it were a question of lines, of planes, and of solids.\u201d And\nelsewhere he remarks that he will consider our passions and their\nproperties with the same eye with which he looks on all other natural\nthings, since the consequences of our affections flow from their nature\nwith the same necessity as it results from the nature of a triangle that\nits three angles should be equal to two right angles. Similarly M. Taine,\nin the introduction to his history of English literature, has written:\n\u201cWhether facts be moral or physical, it makes no matter. They always have\ntheir causes. There are causes for ambition, courage, veracity, just as\nthere are for digestion, muscular movement, animal heat. Vice and virtue\nare products like vitriol and sugar.\u201d When we read such proclamations of\nthe intellect bent on showing the existential conditions of absolutely\neverything, we feel\u2014quite apart from our legitimate impatience at the\nsomewhat ridiculous swagger of the program, in view of what the authors\nare actually able to perform\u2014menaced and negated in the springs of our\ninnermost life. Such cold\u2010blooded assimilations threaten, we think, to\nundo our soul\u2019s vital secrets, as if the same breath which should succeed\nin explaining their origin would simultaneously explain away their\nsignificance, and make them appear of no more preciousness, either, than\nthe useful groceries of which M. Taine speaks.\nPerhaps the commonest expression of this assumption that spiritual value\nis undone if lowly origin be asserted is seen in those comments which\nunsentimental people so often pass on their more sentimental\nacquaintances. Alfred believes in immortality so strongly because his\ntemperament is so emotional. Fanny\u2019s extraordinary conscientiousness is\nmerely a matter of over\u2010instigated nerves. William\u2019s melancholy about the\nuniverse is due to bad digestion\u2014probably his liver is torpid. Eliza\u2019s\ndelight in her church is a symptom of her hysterical constitution. Peter\nwould be less troubled about his soul if he would take more exercise in\nthe open air, etc. A more fully developed example of the same kind of\nreasoning is the fashion, quite common nowadays among certain writers, of\ncriticising the religious emotions by showing a connection between them\nand the sexual life. Conversion is a crisis of puberty and adolescence.\nThe macerations of saints, and the devotion of missionaries, are only\ninstances of the parental instinct of self\u2010sacrifice gone astray. For the\nhysterical nun, starving for natural life, Christ is but an imaginary\nsubstitute for a more earthly object of affection. And the like.(1)\nWe are surely all familiar in a general way with this method of\ndiscrediting states of mind for which we have an antipathy. We all use it\nto some degree in criticising persons whose states of mind we regard as\noverstrained. But when other people criticise our own more exalted soul\u2010\nflights by calling them \u201cnothing but\u201d expressions of our organic\ndisposition, we feel outraged and hurt, for we know that, whatever be our\norganism\u2019s peculiarities, our mental states have their substantive value\nas revelations of the living truth; and we wish that all this medical\nmaterialism could be made to hold its tongue.\nMedical materialism seems indeed a good appellation for the too simple\u2010\nminded system of thought which we are considering. Medical materialism\nfinishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision on the road to Damascus a\ndischarging lesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic. It\nsnuffs out Saint Teresa as an hysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi as an\nhereditary degenerate. George Fox\u2019s discontent with the shams of his age,\nand his pining for spiritual veracity, it treats as a symptom of a\ndisordered colon. Carlyle\u2019s organ\u2010tones of misery it accounts for by a\ngastro\u2010duodenal catarrh. All such mental over\u2010tensions, it says, are, when\nyou come to the bottom of the matter, mere affairs of diathesis (auto\u2010\nintoxications most probably), due to the perverted action of various\nglands which physiology will yet discover.\nAnd medical materialism then thinks that the spiritual authority of all\nsuch personages is successfully undermined.(2)\nLet us ourselves look at the matter in the largest possible way. Modern\npsychology, finding definite psycho\u2010physical connections to hold good,\nassumes as a convenient hypothesis that the dependence of mental states\nupon bodily conditions must be thorough\u2010going and complete. If we adopt\nthe assumption, then of course what medical materialism insists on must be\ntrue in a general way, if not in every detail: Saint Paul certainly had\nonce an epileptoid, if not an epileptic seizure; George Fox was an\nhereditary degenerate; Carlyle was undoubtedly auto\u2010intoxicated by some\norgan or other, no matter which,\u2014and the rest. But now, I ask you, how can\nsuch an existential account of facts of mental history decide in one way\nor another upon their spiritual significance? According to the general\npostulate of psychology just referred to, there is not a single one of our\nstates of mind, high or low, healthy or morbid, that has not some organic\nprocess as its condition. Scientific theories are organically conditioned\njust as much as religious emotions are; and if we only knew the facts\nintimately enough, we should doubtless see \u201cthe liver\u201d determining the\ndicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as it does those of the\nMethodist under conviction anxious about his soul. When it alters in one\nway the blood that percolates it, we get the methodist, when in another\nway, we get the atheist form of mind. So of all our raptures and our\ndrynesses, our longings and pantings, our questions and beliefs. They are\nequally organically founded, be they of religious or of non\u2010religious\ncontent.\nTo plead the organic causation of a religious state of mind, then, in\nrefutation of its claim to possess superior spiritual value, is quite\nillogical and arbitrary, unless one have already worked out in advance\nsome psycho\u2010physical theory connecting spiritual values in general with\ndeterminate sorts of physiological change. Otherwise none of our thoughts\nand feelings, not even our scientific doctrines, not even our\n_dis_\u2010beliefs, could retain any value as revelations of the truth, for\nevery one of them without exception flows from the state of their\npossessor\u2019s body at the time.\nIt is needless to say that medical materialism draws in point of fact no\nsuch sweeping skeptical conclusion. It is sure, just as every simple man\nis sure, that some states of mind are inwardly superior to others, and\nreveal to us more truth, and in this it simply makes use of an ordinary\nspiritual judgment. It has no physiological theory of the production of\nthese its favorite states, by which it may accredit them; and its attempt\nto discredit the states which it dislikes, by vaguely associating them\nwith nerves and liver, and connecting them with names connoting bodily\naffliction, is altogether illogical and inconsistent.\nLet us play fair in this whole matter, and be quite candid with ourselves\nand with the facts. When we think certain states of mind superior to\nothers, is it ever because of what we know concerning their organic\nantecedents? No! it is always for two entirely different reasons. It is\neither because we take an immediate delight in them; or else it is because\nwe believe them to bring us good consequential fruits for life. When we\nspeak disparagingly of \u201cfeverish fancies,\u201d surely the fever\u2010process as\nsuch is not the ground of our disesteem\u2014for aught we know to the contrary,\n103\u00b0 or 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit might be a much more favorable temperature for\ntruths to germinate and sprout in, than the more ordinary blood\u2010heat of 97\nor 98 degrees. It is either the disagreeableness itself of the fancies, or\ntheir inability to bear the criticisms of the convalescent hour. When we\npraise the thoughts which health brings, health\u2019s peculiar chemical\nmetabolisms have nothing to do with determining our judgment. We know in\nfact almost nothing about these metabolisms. It is the character of inner\nhappiness in the thoughts which stamps them as good, or else their\nconsistency with our other opinions and their serviceability for our\nneeds, which make them pass for true in our esteem.\nNow the more intrinsic and the more remote of these criteria do not always\nhang together. Inner happiness and serviceability do not always agree.\nWhat immediately feels most \u201cgood\u201d is not always most \u201ctrue,\u201d when\nmeasured by the verdict of the rest of experience. The difference between\nPhilip drunk and Philip sober is the classic instance in corroboration. If\nmerely \u201cfeeling good\u201d could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely\nvalid human experience. But its revelations, however acutely satisfying at\nthe moment, are inserted into an environment which refuses to bear them\nout for any length of time. The consequence of this discrepancy of the two\ncriteria is the uncertainty which still prevails over so many of our\nspiritual judgments. There are moments of sentimental and mystical\nexperience\u2014we shall hereafter hear much of them\u2014that carry an enormous\nsense of inner authority and illumination with them when they come. But\nthey come seldom, and they do not come to every one; and the rest of life\nmakes either no connection with them, or tends to contradict them more\nthan it confirms them. Some persons follow more the voice of the moment in\nthese cases, some prefer to be guided by the average results. Hence the\nsad discordancy of so many of the spiritual judgments of human beings; a\ndiscordancy which will be brought home to us acutely enough before these\nlectures end.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIt is, however, a discordancy that can never be resolved by any merely\nmedical test. A good example of the impossibility of holding strictly to\nthe medical tests is seen in the theory of the pathological causation of\ngenius promulgated by recent authors. \u201cGenius,\u201d said Dr. Moreau, \u201cis but\none of the many branches of the neuropathic tree.\u201d \u201cGenius,\u201d says Dr.\nLombroso, \u201cis a symptom of hereditary degeneration of the epileptoid\nvariety, and is allied to moral insanity.\u201d \u201cWhenever a man\u2019s life,\u201d writes\nMr. Nisbet, \u201cis at once sufficiently illustrious and recorded with\nsufficient fullness to be a subject of profitable study, he inevitably\nfalls into the morbid category.... And it is worthy of remark that, as a\nrule, the greater the genius, the greater the unsoundness.\u201d(3)\nNow do these authors, after having succeeded in establishing to their own\nsatisfaction that the works of genius are fruits of disease, consistently\nproceed thereupon to impugn the _value_ of the fruits? Do they deduce a\nnew spiritual judgment from their new doctrine of existential conditions?\nDo they frankly forbid us to admire the productions of genius from now\nonwards? and say outright that no neuropath can ever be a revealer of new\ntruth?\nNo! their immediate spiritual instincts are too strong for them here, and\nhold their own against inferences which, in mere love of logical\nconsistency, medical materialism ought to be only too glad to draw. One\ndisciple of the school, indeed, has striven to impugn the value of works\nof genius in a wholesale way (such works of contemporary art, namely, as\nhe himself is unable to enjoy, and they are many) by using medical\narguments.(4) But for the most part the masterpieces are left\nunchallenged; and the medical line of attack either confines itself to\nsuch secular productions as every one admits to be intrinsically\neccentric, or else addresses itself exclusively to religious\nmanifestations. And then it is because the religious manifestations have\nbeen already condemned because the critic dislikes them on internal or\nspiritual grounds.\nIn the natural sciences and industrial arts it never occurs to any one to\ntry to refute opinions by showing up their author\u2019s neurotic constitution.\nOpinions here are invariably tested by logic and by experiment, no matter\nwhat may be their author\u2019s neurological type. It should be no otherwise\nwith religious opinions. Their value can only be ascertained by spiritual\njudgments directly passed upon them, judgments based on our own immediate\nfeeling primarily; and secondarily on what we can ascertain of their\nexperiential relations to our moral needs and to the rest of what we hold\nas true.\n_Immediate luminousness_, in short, _philosophical reasonableness_, and\n_moral helpfulness_ are the only available criteria. Saint Teresa might\nhave had the nervous system of the placidest cow, and it would not now\nsave her theology, if the trial of the theology by these other tests\nshould show it to be contemptible. And conversely if her theology can\nstand these other tests, it will make no difference how hysterical or\nnervously off her balance Saint Teresa may have been when she was with us\nhere below.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nYou see that at bottom we are thrown back upon the general principles by\nwhich the empirical philosophy has always contended that we must be guided\nin our search for truth. Dogmatic philosophies have sought for tests for\ntruth which might dispense us from appealing to the future. Some direct\nmark, by noting which we can be protected immediately and absolutely, now\nand forever, against all mistake\u2014such has been the darling dream of\nphilosophic dogmatists. It is clear that the _origin_ of the truth would\nbe an admirable criterion of this sort, if only the various origins could\nbe discriminated from one another from this point of view, and the history\nof dogmatic opinion shows that origin has always been a favorite test.\nOrigin in immediate intuition; origin in pontifical authority; origin in\nsupernatural revelation, as by vision, hearing, or unaccountable\nimpression; origin in direct possession by a higher spirit, expressing\nitself in prophecy and warning; origin in automatic utterance\ngenerally,\u2014these origins have been stock warrants for the truth of one\nopinion after another which we find represented in religious history. The\nmedical materialists are therefore only so many belated dogmatists, neatly\nturning the tables on their predecessors by using the criterion of origin\nin a destructive instead of an accreditive way.\nThey are effective with their talk of pathological origin only so long as\nsupernatural origin is pleaded by the other side, and nothing but the\nargument from origin is under discussion. But the argument from origin has\nseldom been used alone, for it is too obviously insufficient. Dr. Maudsley\nis perhaps the cleverest of the rebutters of supernatural religion on\ngrounds of origin. Yet he finds himself forced to write:\u2014\n\u201cWhat right have we to believe Nature under any obligation to do her work\nby means of complete minds only? She may find an incomplete mind a more\nsuitable instrument for a particular purpose. It is the work that is done,\nand the quality in the worker by which it was done, that is alone of\nmoment; and it may be no great matter from a cosmical standpoint, if in\nother qualities of character he was singularly defective\u2014if indeed he were\nhypocrite, adulterer, eccentric, or lunatic.... Home we come again, then,\nto the old and last resort of certitude,\u2014namely the common assent of\nmankind, or of the competent by instruction and training among\nmankind.\u201d(5)\nIn other words, not its origin, but _the way in which it works on the\nwhole_, is Dr. Maudsley\u2019s final test of a belief. This is our own\nempiricist criterion; and this criterion the stoutest insisters on\nsupernatural origin have also been forced to use in the end. Among the\nvisions and messages some have always been too patently silly, among the\ntrances and convulsive seizures some have been too fruitless for conduct\nand character, to pass themselves off as significant, still less as\ndivine. In the history of Christian mysticism the problem how to\ndiscriminate between such messages and experiences as were really divine\nmiracles, and such others as the demon in his malice was able to\ncounterfeit, thus making the religious person twofold more the child of\nhell he was before, has always been a difficult one to solve, needing all\nthe sagacity and experience of the best directors of conscience. In the\nend it had to come to our empiricist criterion: By their fruits ye shall\nknow them, not by their roots, Jonathan Edwards\u2019s Treatise on Religious\nAffections is an elaborate working out of this thesis. The _roots_ of a\nman\u2019s virtue are inaccessible to us. No appearances whatever are\ninfallible proofs of grace. Our practice is the only sure evidence, even\nto ourselves, that we are genuinely Christians.\n\u201cIn forming a judgment of ourselves now,\u201d Edwards writes, \u201cwe\nshould certainly adopt that evidence which our supreme Judge will\nchiefly make use of when we come to stand before him at the last\nday.... There is not one grace of the Spirit of God, of the\nexistence of which, in any professor of religion, Christian\npractice is not the most decisive evidence.... The degree in which\nour experience is productive of practice shows the degree in which\nour experience is spiritual and divine.\u201d\nCatholic writers are equally emphatic. The good dispositions which a\nvision, or voice, or other apparent heavenly favor leave behind them are\nthe only marks by which we may be sure they are not possible deceptions of\nthe tempter. Says Saint Teresa:\u2014\n\u201cLike imperfect sleep which, instead of giving more strength to\nthe head, doth but leave it the more exhausted, the result of mere\noperations of the imagination is but to weaken the soul. Instead\nof nourishment and energy she reaps only lassitude and disgust:\nwhereas a genuine heavenly vision yields to her a harvest of\nineffable spiritual riches, and an admirable renewal of bodily\nstrength. I alleged these reasons to those who so often accused my\nvisions of being the work of the enemy of mankind and the sport of\nmy imagination.... I showed them the jewels which the divine hand\nhad left with me:\u2014they were my actual dispositions. All those who\nknew me saw that I was changed; my confessor bore witness to the\nfact; this improvement, palpable in all respects, far from being\nhidden, was brilliantly evident to all men. As for myself, it was\nimpossible to believe that if the demon were its author, he could\nhave used, in order to lose me and lead me to hell, an expedient\nso contrary to his own interests as that of uprooting my vices,\nand filling me with masculine courage and other virtues instead,\nfor I saw clearly that a single one of these visions was enough to\nenrich me with all that wealth.\u201d(6)\nI fear I may have made a longer excursus than was necessary, and that\nfewer words would have dispelled the uneasiness which may have arisen\namong some of you as I announced my pathological programme. At any rate\nyou must all be ready now to judge the religious life by its results\nexclusively, and I shall assume that the bugaboo of morbid origin will\nscandalize your piety no more.\nStill, you may ask me, if its results are to be the ground of our final\nspiritual estimate of a religious phenomenon, why threaten us at all with\nso much existential study of its conditions? Why not simply leave\npathological questions out?\nTo this I reply in two ways: First, I say, irrepressible curiosity\nimperiously leads one on; and I say, secondly, that it always leads to a\nbetter understanding of a thing\u2019s significance to consider its\nexaggerations and perversions, its equivalents and substitutes and nearest\nrelatives elsewhere. Not that we may thereby swamp the thing in the\nwholesale condemnation which we pass on its inferior congeners, but rather\nthat we may by contrast ascertain the more precisely in what its merits\nconsist, by learning at the same time to what particular dangers of\ncorruption it may also be exposed.\nInsane conditions have this advantage, that they isolate special factors\nof the mental life, and enable us to inspect them unmasked by their more\nusual surroundings. They play the part in mental anatomy which the scalpel\nand the microscope play in the anatomy of the body. To understand a thing\nrightly we need to see it both out of its environment and in it, and to\nhave acquaintance with the whole range of its variations. The study of\nhallucinations has in this way been for psychologists the key to their\ncomprehension of normal sensation, that of illusions has been the key to\nthe right comprehension of perception. Morbid impulses and imperative\nconceptions, \u201cfixed ideas,\u201d so called, have thrown a flood of light on the\npsychology of the normal will; and obsessions and delusions have performed\nthe same service for that of the normal faculty of belief.\nSimilarly, the nature of genius has been illuminated by the attempts, of\nwhich I already made mention, to class it with psychopathical phenomena.\nBorderland insanity, crankiness, insane temperament, loss of mental\nbalance, psychopathic degeneration (to use a few of the many synonyms by\nwhich it has been called), has certain peculiarities and liabilities\nwhich, when combined with a superior quality of intellect in an\nindividual, make it more probable that he will make his mark and affect\nhis age, than if his temperament were less neurotic. There is of course no\nspecial affinity between crankiness as such and superior intellect,(7) for\nmost psychopaths have feeble intellects, and superior intellects more\ncommonly have normal nervous systems. But the psychopathic temperament,\nwhatever be the intellect with which it finds itself paired, often brings\nwith it ardor and excitability of character. The cranky person has\nextraordinary emotional susceptibility. He is liable to fixed ideas and\nobsessions. His conceptions tend to pass immediately into belief and\naction; and when he gets a new idea, he has no rest till he proclaims it,\nor in some way \u201cworks it off.\u201d \u201cWhat shall I think of it?\u201d a common person\nsays to himself about a vexed question; but in a \u201ccranky\u201d mind \u201cWhat must\nI do about it?\u201d is the form the question tends to take. In the\nautobiography of that high\u2010souled woman, Mrs. Annie Besant, I read the\nfollowing passage: \u201cPlenty of people wish well to any good cause, but very\nfew care to exert themselves to help it, and still fewer will risk\nanything in its support. \u2018Some one ought to do it, but why should I?\u2019 is\nthe ever re\u00ebchoed phrase of weak\u2010kneed amiability. \u2018Some one ought to do\nit, so why not I?\u2019 is the cry of some earnest servant of man, eagerly\nforward springing to face some perilous duty. Between these two sentences\nlie whole centuries of moral evolution.\u201d True enough! and between these\ntwo sentences lie also the different destinies of the ordinary sluggard\nand the psychopathic man. Thus, when a superior intellect and a\npsychopathic temperament coalesce\u2014as in the endless permutations and\ncombinations of human faculty, they are bound to coalesce often enough\u2014in\nthe same individual, we have the best possible condition for the kind of\neffective genius that gets into the biographical dictionaries. Such men do\nnot remain mere critics and understanders with their intellect. Their\nideas possess them, they inflict them, for better or worse, upon their\ncompanions or their age. It is they who get counted when Messrs Lombroso,\nNisbet, and others invoke statistics to defend their paradox.\nTo pass now to religious phenomena, take the melancholy which, as we shall\nsee, constitutes an essential moment in every complete religious\nevolution. Take the happiness which achieved religious belief confers.\nTake the trance\u2010like states of insight into truth which all religious\nmystics report.(8) These are each and all of them special cases of kinds\nof human experience of much wider scope. Religious melancholy, whatever\npeculiarities it may have _qu\u00e2_ religious, is at any rate melancholy.\nReligious happiness is happiness. Religious trance is trance. And the\nmoment we renounce the absurd notion that a thing is exploded away as soon\nas it is classed with others, or its origin is shown; the moment we agree\nto stand by experimental results and inner quality, in judging of\nvalues,\u2014who does not see that we are likely to ascertain the distinctive\nsignificance of religious melancholy and happiness, or of religious\ntrances, far better by comparing them as conscientiously as we can with\nother varieties of melancholy, happiness, and trance, than by refusing to\nconsider their place in any more general series, and treating them as if\nthey were outside of nature\u2019s order altogether?\nI hope that the course of these lectures will confirm us in this\nsupposition. As regards the psychopathic origin of so many religious\nphenomena, that would not be in the least surprising or disconcerting,\neven were such phenomena certified from on high to be the most precious of\nhuman experiences. No one organism can possibly yield to its owner the\nwhole body of truth. Few of us are not in some way infirm, or even\ndiseased; and our very infirmities help us unexpectedly. In the\npsychopathic temperament we have the emotionality which is the _sine qu\u00e2\nnon_ of moral perception; we have the intensity and tendency to emphasis\nwhich are the essence of practical moral vigor; and we have the love of\nmetaphysics and mysticism which carry one\u2019s interests beyond the surface\nof the sensible world. What, then, is more natural than that this\ntemperament should introduce one to regions of religious truth, to corners\nof the universe, which your robust Philistine type of nervous system,\nforever offering its biceps to be felt, thumping its breast, and thanking\nHeaven that it hasn\u2019t a single morbid fibre in its composition, would be\nsure to hide forever from its self\u2010satisfied possessors?\nIf there were such a thing as inspiration from a higher realm, it might\nwell be that the neurotic temperament would furnish the chief condition of\nthe requisite receptivity. And having said thus much, I think that I may\nlet the matter of religion and neuroticism drop.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe mass of collateral phenomena, morbid or healthy, with which the\nvarious religious phenomena must be compared in order to understand them\nbetter, forms what in the slang of pedagogics is termed \u201cthe apperceiving\nmass\u201d by which we comprehend them. The only novelty that I can imagine\nthis course of lectures to possess lies in the breadth of the apperceiving\nmass. I may succeed in discussing religious experiences in a wider context\nthan has been usual in university courses.\nLECTURE II. CIRCUMSCRIPTION OF THE TOPIC.\nMost books on the philosophy of religion try to begin with a precise\ndefinition of what its essence consists of. Some of these would\u2010be\ndefinitions may possibly come before us in later portions of this course,\nand I shall not be pedantic enough to enumerate any of them to you now.\nMeanwhile the very fact that they are so many and so different from one\nanother is enough to prove that the word \u201creligion\u201d cannot stand for any\nsingle principle or essence, but is rather a collective name. The\ntheorizing mind tends always to the over\u2010simplification of its materials.\nThis is the root of all that absolutism and one\u2010sided dogmatism by which\nboth philosophy and religion have been infested. Let us not fall\nimmediately into a one\u2010sided view of our subject, but let us rather admit\nfreely at the outset that we may very likely find no one essence, but many\ncharacters which may alternately be equally important in religion. If we\nshould inquire for the essence of \u201cgovernment,\u201d for example, one man might\ntell us it was authority, another submission, another police, another an\narmy, another an assembly, another a system of laws; yet all the while it\nwould be true that no concrete government can exist without all these\nthings, one of which is more important at one moment and others at\nanother. The man who knows governments most completely is he who troubles\nhimself least about a definition which shall give their essence. Enjoying\nan intimate acquaintance with all their particularities in turn, he would\nnaturally regard an abstract conception in which these were unified as a\nthing more misleading than enlightening. And why may not religion be a\nconception equally complex?(9)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nConsider also the \u201creligious sentiment\u201d which we see referred to in so\nmany books, as if it were a single sort of mental entity.\nIn the psychologies and in the philosophies of religion, we find the\nauthors attempting to specify just what entity it is. One man allies it to\nthe feeling of dependence; one makes it a derivative from fear; others\nconnect it with the sexual life; others still identify it with the feeling\nof the infinite; and so on. Such different ways of conceiving it ought of\nthemselves to arouse doubt as to whether it possibly can be one specific\nthing; and the moment we are willing to treat the term \u201creligious\nsentiment\u201d as a collective name for the many sentiments which religious\nobjects may arouse in alternation, we see that it probably contains\nnothing whatever of a psychologically specific nature. There is religious\nfear, religious love, religious awe, religious joy, and so forth. But\nreligious love is only man\u2019s natural emotion of love directed to a\nreligious object; religious fear is only the ordinary fear of commerce, so\nto speak, the common quaking of the human breast, in so far as the notion\nof divine retribution may arouse it; religious awe is the same organic\nthrill which we feel in a forest at twilight, or in a mountain gorge; only\nthis time it comes over us at the thought of our supernatural relations;\nand similarly of all the various sentiments which may be called into play\nin the lives of religious persons. As concrete states of mind, made up of\na feeling _plus_ a specific sort of object, religious emotions of course\nare psychic entities distinguishable from other concrete emotions; but\nthere is no ground for assuming a simple abstract \u201creligious emotion\u201d to\nexist as a distinct elementary mental affection by itself, present in\nevery religious experience without exception.\nAs there thus seems to be no one elementary religious emotion, but only a\ncommon storehouse of emotions upon which religious objects may draw, so\nthere might conceivably also prove to be no one specific and essential\nkind of religious object, and no one specific and essential kind of\nreligious act.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe field of religion being as wide as this, it is manifestly impossible\nthat I should pretend to cover it. My lectures must be limited to a\nfraction of the subject. And, although it would indeed be foolish to set\nup an abstract definition of religion\u2019s essence, and then proceed to\ndefend that definition against all comers, yet this need not prevent me\nfrom taking my own narrow view of what religion shall consist in _for the\npurpose of these lectures_, or, out of the many meanings of the word, from\nchoosing the one meaning in which I wish to interest you particularly, and\nproclaiming arbitrarily that when I say \u201creligion\u201d I mean _that_. This, in\nfact, is what I must do, and I will now preliminarily seek to mark out the\nfield I choose.\nOne way to mark it out easily is to say what aspects of the subject we\nleave out. At the outset we are struck by one great partition which\ndivides the religious field. On the one side of it lies institutional, on\nthe other personal religion. As M. P. Sabatier says, one branch of\nreligion keeps the divinity, another keeps man most in view. Worship and\nsacrifice, procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity,\ntheology and ceremony and ecclesiastical organization, are the essentials\nof religion in the institutional branch. Were we to limit our view to it,\nwe should have to define religion as an external art, the art of winning\nthe favor of the gods. In the more personal branch of religion it is on\nthe contrary the inner dispositions of man himself which form the centre\nof interest, his conscience, his deserts, his helplessness, his\nincompleteness. And although the favor of the God, as forfeited or gained,\nis still an essential feature of the story, and theology plays a vital\npart therein, yet the acts to which this sort of religion prompts are\npersonal not ritual acts, the individual transacts the business by himself\nalone, and the ecclesiastical organization, with its priests and\nsacraments and other go\u2010betweens, sinks to an altogether secondary place.\nThe relation goes direct from heart to heart, from soul to soul, between\nman and his maker.\nNow in these lectures I propose to ignore the institutional branch\nentirely, to say nothing of the ecclesiastical organization, to consider\nas little as possible the systematic theology and the ideas about the gods\nthemselves, and to confine myself as far as I can to personal religion\npure and simple. To some of you personal religion, thus nakedly\nconsidered, will no doubt seem too incomplete a thing to wear the general\nname. \u201cIt is a part of religion,\u201d you will say, \u201cbut only its unorganized\nrudiment; if we are to name it by itself, we had better call it man\u2019s\nconscience or morality than his religion. The name \u2018religion\u2019 should be\nreserved for the fully organized system of feeling, thought, and\ninstitution, for the Church, in short, of which this personal religion, so\ncalled, is but a fractional element.\u201d\nBut if you say this, it will only show the more plainly how much the\nquestion of definition tends to become a dispute about names. Rather than\nprolong such a dispute, I am willing to accept almost any name for the\npersonal religion of which I propose to treat. Call it conscience or\nmorality, if you yourselves prefer, and not religion\u2014under either name it\nwill be equally worthy of our study. As for myself, I think it will prove\nto contain some elements which morality pure and simple does not contain,\nand these elements I shall soon seek to point out; so I will myself\ncontinue to apply the word \u201creligion\u201d to it; and in the last lecture of\nall, I will bring in the theologies and the ecclesiasticisms, and say\nsomething of its relation to them.\nIn one sense at least the personal religion will prove itself more\nfundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism. Churches, when once\nestablished, live at second\u2010hand upon tradition; but the _founders_ of\nevery church owed their power originally to the fact of their direct\npersonal communion with the divine. Not only the superhuman founders, the\nChrist, the Buddha, Mahomet, but all the originators of Christian sects\nhave been in this case;\u2014so personal religion should still seem the\nprimordial thing, even to those who continue to esteem it incomplete.\nThere are, it is true, other things in religion chronologically more\nprimordial than personal devoutness in the moral sense. Fetishism and\nmagic seem to have preceded inward piety historically\u2014at least our records\nof inward piety do not reach back so far. And if fetishism and magic be\nregarded as stages of religion, one may say that personal religion in the\ninward sense and the genuinely spiritual ecclesiasticisms which it founds\nare phenomena of secondary or even tertiary order. But, quite apart from\nthe fact that many anthropologists\u2014for instance, Jevons and\nFrazer\u2014expressly oppose \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmagic\u201d to each other, it is\ncertain that the whole system of thought which leads to magic, fetishism,\nand the lower superstitions may just as well be called primitive science\nas called primitive religion. The question thus becomes a verbal one\nagain; and our knowledge of all these early stages of thought and feeling\nis in any case so conjectural and imperfect that farther discussion would\nnot be worth while.\nReligion, therefore, as I now ask you arbitrarily to take it, shall mean\nfor us _the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their\nsolitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to\nwhatever they may consider the divine_. Since the relation may be either\nmoral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in the\nsense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical\norganizations may secondarily grow. In these lectures, however, as I have\nalready said, the immediate personal experiences will amply fill our time,\nand we shall hardly consider theology or ecclesiasticism at all.\nWe escape much controversial matter by this arbitrary definition of our\nfield. But, still, a chance of controversy comes up over the word \u201cdivine\u201d\nif we take it in the definition in too narrow a sense. There are systems\nof thought which the world usually calls religious, and yet which do not\npositively assume a God. Buddhism is in this case. Popularly, of course,\nthe Buddha himself stands in place of a God; but in strictness the\nBuddhistic system is atheistic. Modern transcendental idealism,\nEmersonianism, for instance, also seems to let God evaporate into abstract\nIdeality. Not a deity _in concreto_, not a superhuman person, but the\nimmanent divinity in things, the essentially spiritual structure of the\nuniverse, is the object of the transcendentalist cult. In that address to\nthe graduating class at Divinity College in 1838 which made Emerson\nfamous, the frank expression of this worship of mere abstract laws was\nwhat made the scandal of the performance.\n\u201cThese laws,\u201d said the speaker, \u201cexecute themselves. They are out\nof time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance: Thus, in\nthe soul of man there is a justice whose retributions are instant\nand entire. He who does a good deed is instantly ennobled. He who\ndoes a mean deed is by the action itself contracted. He who puts\noff impurity thereby puts on purity. If a man is at heart just,\nthen in so far is he God; the safety of God, the immortality of\nGod, the majesty of God, do enter into that man with justice. If a\nman dissemble, deceive, he deceives himself, and goes out of\nacquaintance with his own being. Character is always known. Thefts\nnever enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of\nstone walls. The least admixture of a lie\u2014for example, the taint\nof vanity, any attempt to make a good impression, a favorable\nappearance\u2014will instantly vitiate the effect. But speak the truth,\nand all things alive or brute are vouchers, and the very roots of\nthe grass underground there do seem to stir and move to bear your\nwitness. For all things proceed out of the same spirit, which is\ndifferently named love, justice, temperance, in its different\napplications, just as the ocean receives different names on the\nseveral shores which it washes. In so far as he roves from these\nends, a man bereaves himself of power, of auxiliaries. His being\nshrinks ... he becomes less and less, a mote, a point, until\nabsolute badness is absolute death. The perception of this law\nawakens in the mind a sentiment which we call the religious\nsentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its\npower to charm and to command. It is a mountain air. It is the\nembalmer of the world. It makes the sky and the hills sublime, and\nthe silent song of the stars is it. It is the beatitude of man. It\nmakes him illimitable. When he says \u2018I ought\u2019; when love warns\nhim; when he chooses, warned from on high, the good and great\ndeed; then, deep melodies wander through his soul from supreme\nwisdom. Then he can worship, and be enlarged by his worship; for\nhe can never go behind this sentiment. All the expressions of this\nsentiment are sacred and permanent in proportion to their purity.\n[They] affect us more than all other compositions. The sentences\nof the olden time, which ejaculate this piety, are still fresh and\nfragrant. And the unique impression of Jesus upon mankind, whose\nname is not so much written as ploughed into the history of this\nworld, is proof of the subtle virtue of this infusion.\u201d(10)\nSuch is the Emersonian religion. The universe has a divine soul of order,\nwhich soul is moral, being also the soul within the soul of man. But\nwhether this soul of the universe be a mere quality like the eye\u2019s\nbrilliancy or the skin\u2019s softness, or whether it be a self\u2010conscious life\nlike the eye\u2019s seeing or the skin\u2019s feeling, is a decision that never\nunmistakably appears in Emerson\u2019s pages. It quivers on the boundary of\nthese things, sometimes leaning one way, sometimes the other, to suit the\nliterary rather than the philosophic need. Whatever it is, though, it is\nactive. As much as if it were a God, we can trust it to protect all ideal\ninterests and keep the world\u2019s balance straight. The sentences in which\nEmerson, to the very end, gave utterance to this faith are as fine as\nanything in literature: \u201cIf you love and serve men, you cannot by any\nhiding or stratagem escape the remuneration. Secret retributions are\nalways restoring the level, when disturbed, of the divine justice. It is\nimpossible to tilt the beam. All the tyrants and proprietors and\nmonopolists of the world in vain set their shoulders to heave the bar.\nSettles forevermore the ponderous equator to its line, and man and mote,\nand star and sun, must range to it, or be pulverized by the recoil.\u201d(11)\nNow it would be too absurd to say that the inner experiences that underlie\nsuch expressions of faith as this and impel the writer to their utterance\nare quite unworthy to be called religious experiences. The sort of appeal\nthat Emersonian optimism, on the one hand, and Buddhistic pessimism, on\nthe other, make to the individual and the sort of response which he makes\nto them in his life are in fact indistinguishable from, and in many\nrespects identical with, the best Christian appeal and response. We must\ntherefore, from the experiential point of view, call these godless or\nquasi\u2010godless creeds \u201creligions\u201d; and accordingly when in our definition\nof religion we speak of the individual\u2019s relation to \u201cwhat he considers\nthe divine,\u201d we must interpret the term \u201cdivine\u201d very broadly, as denoting\nany object that is god_like_, whether it be a concrete deity or not.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut the term \u201cgodlike,\u201d if thus treated as a floating general quality,\nbecomes exceedingly vague, for many gods have flourished in religious\nhistory, and their attributes have been discrepant enough. What then is\nthat essentially godlike quality\u2014be it embodied in a concrete deity or\nnot\u2014our relation to which determines our character as religious men? It\nwill repay us to seek some answer to this question before we proceed\nfarther.\nFor one thing, gods are conceived to be first things in the way of being\nand power. They overarch and envelop, and from them there is no escape.\nWhat relates to them is the first and last word in the way of truth.\nWhatever then were most primal and enveloping and deeply true might at\nthis rate be treated as godlike, and a man\u2019s religion might thus be\nidentified with his attitude, whatever it might be, towards what he felt\nto be the primal truth.\nSuch a definition as this would in a way be defensible. Religion, whatever\nit is, is a man\u2019s total reaction upon life, so why not say that any total\nreaction upon life is a religion? Total reactions are different from\ncasual reactions, and total attitudes are different from usual or\nprofessional attitudes. To get at them you must go behind the foreground\nof existence and reach down to that curious sense of the whole residual\ncosmos as an everlasting presence, intimate or alien, terrible or amusing,\nlovable or odious, which in some degree every one possesses. This sense of\nthe world\u2019s presence, appealing as it does to our peculiar individual\ntemperament, makes us either strenuous or careless, devout or blasphemous,\ngloomy or exultant, about life at large; and our reaction, involuntary and\ninarticulate and often half unconscious as it is, is the completest of all\nour answers to the question, \u201cWhat is the character of this universe in\nwhich we dwell?\u201d It expresses our individual sense of it in the most\ndefinite way. Why then not call these reactions our religion, no matter\nwhat specific character they may have? Non\u2010religious as some of these\nreactions may be, in one sense of the word \u201creligious,\u201d they yet belong to\n_the general sphere of the religious life_, and so should generically be\nclassed as religious reactions. \u201cHe believes in No\u2010God, and he worships\nhim,\u201d said a colleague of mine of a student who was manifesting a fine\natheistic ardor; and the more fervent opponents of Christian doctrine have\noften enough shown a temper which, psychologically considered, is\nindistinguishable from religious zeal.\nBut so very broad a use of the word \u201creligion\u201d would be inconvenient,\nhowever defensible it might remain on logical grounds. There are trifling,\nsneering attitudes even towards the whole of life; and in some men these\nattitudes are final and systematic. It would strain the ordinary use of\nlanguage too much to call such attitudes religious, even though, from the\npoint of view of an unbiased critical philosophy, they might conceivably\nbe perfectly reasonable ways of looking upon life. Voltaire, for example,\nwrites thus to a friend, at the age of seventy\u2010three: \u201cAs for myself,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cweak as I am, I carry on the war to the last moment, I get a\nhundred pike\u2010thrusts, I return two hundred, and I laugh. I see near my\ndoor Geneva on fire with quarrels over nothing, and I laugh again; and,\nthank God, I can look upon the world as a farce even when it becomes as\ntragic as it sometimes does. All comes out even at the end of the day, and\nall comes out still more even when all the days are over.\u201d\nMuch as we may admire such a robust old gamecock spirit in a\nvaletudinarian, to call it a religious spirit would be odd. Yet it is for\nthe moment Voltaire\u2019s reaction on the whole of life. _Je m\u2019en fiche_ is\nthe vulgar French equivalent for our English ejaculation \u201cWho cares?\u201d And\nthe happy term _je m\u2019en fichisme_ recently has been invented to designate\nthe systematic determination not to take anything in life too solemnly.\n\u201cAll is vanity\u201d is the relieving word in all difficult crises for this\nmode of thought, which that exquisite literary genius Renan took pleasure,\nin his later days of sweet decay, in putting into coquettishly\nsacrilegious forms which remain to us as excellent expressions of the \u201call\nis vanity\u201d state of mind. Take the following passage, for example,\u2014we must\nhold to duty, even against the evidence, Renan says,\u2014but he then goes on:\u2014\n\u201cThere are many chances that the world may be nothing but a fairy\npantomime of which no God has care. We must therefore arrange\nourselves so that on neither hypothesis we shall be completely\nwrong. We must listen to the superior voices, but in such a way\nthat if the second hypothesis were true we should not have been\ntoo completely duped. If in effect the world be not a serious\nthing, it is the dogmatic people who will be the shallow ones, and\nthe worldly minded whom the theologians now call frivolous will be\nthose who are really wise.\n\u201c_In utrumque paratus_, then. Be ready for anything\u2014that perhaps\nis wisdom. Give ourselves up, according to the hour, to\nconfidence, to skepticism, to optimism, to irony, and we may be\nsure that at certain moments at least we shall be with the\ntruth.... Good\u2010humor is a philosophic state of mind; it seems to\nsay to Nature that we take her no more seriously than she takes\nus. I maintain that one should always talk of philosophy with a\nsmile. We owe it to the Eternal to be virtuous; but we have the\nright to add to this tribute our irony as a sort of personal\nreprisal. In this way we return to the right quarter jest for\njest; we play the trick that has been played on us. Saint\nAugustine\u2019s phrase: _Lord, if we are deceived, it is by thee!_\nremains a fine one, well suited to our modern feeling. Only we\nwish the Eternal to know that if we accept the fraud, we accept it\nknowingly and willingly. We are resigned in advance to losing the\ninterest on our investments of virtue, but we wish not to appear\nridiculous by having counted on them too securely.\u201d(12)\nSurely all the usual associations of the word \u201creligion\u201d would have to be\nstripped away if such a systematic _parti pris_ of irony were also to be\ndenoted by the name. For common men \u201creligion,\u201d whatever more special\nmeanings it may have, signifies always a _serious_ state of mind. If any\none phrase could gather its universal message, that phrase would be, \u201cAll\nis _not_ vanity in this Universe, whatever the appearances may suggest.\u201d\nIf it can stop anything, religion as commonly apprehended can stop just\nsuch chaffing talk as Renan\u2019s. It favors gravity, not pertness; it says\n\u201chush\u201d to all vain chatter and smart wit.\nBut if hostile to light irony, religion is equally hostile to heavy\ngrumbling and complaint. The world appears tragic enough in some\nreligions, but the tragedy is realized as purging, and a way of\ndeliverance is held to exist. We shall see enough of the religious\nmelancholy in a future lecture; but melancholy, according to our ordinary\nuse of language, forfeits all title to be called religious when, in Marcus\nAurelius\u2019s racy words, the sufferer simply lies kicking and screaming\nafter the fashion of a sacrificed pig. The mood of a Schopenhauer or a\nNietzsche,\u2014and in a less degree one may sometimes say the same of our own\nsad Carlyle,\u2014though often an ennobling sadness, is almost as often only\npeevishness running away with the bit between its teeth. The sallies of\nthe two German authors remind one, half the time, of the sick shriekings\nof two dying rats. They lack the purgatorial note which religious sadness\ngives forth.\nThere must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude\nwhich we denominate religious. If glad, it must not grin or snicker; if\nsad, it must not scream or curse. It is precisely as being _solemn_\nexperiences that I wish to interest you in religious experiences. So I\npropose\u2014arbitrarily again, if you please\u2014to narrow our definition once\nmore by saying that the word \u201cdivine,\u201d as employed therein, shall mean for\nus not merely the primal and enveloping and real, for that meaning if\ntaken without restriction might well prove too broad. The divine shall\nmean for us only such a primal reality as the individual feels impelled to\nrespond to solemnly and gravely, and neither by a curse nor a jest.\nBut solemnity, and gravity, and all such emotional attributes, admit of\nvarious shades; and, do what we will with our defining, the truth must at\nlast be confronted that we are dealing with a field of experience where\nthere is not a single conception that can be sharply drawn. The\npretension, under such conditions, to be rigorously \u201cscientific\u201d or\n\u201cexact\u201d in our terms would only stamp us as lacking in understanding of\nour task. Things are more or less divine, states of mind are more or less\nreligious, reactions are more or less total, but the boundaries are always\nmisty, and it is everywhere a question of amount and degree. Nevertheless,\nat their extreme of development, there can never be any question as to\nwhat experiences are religious. The divinity of the object and the\nsolemnity of the reaction are too well marked for doubt. Hesitation as to\nwhether a state of mind is \u201creligious,\u201d or \u201cirreligious,\u201d or \u201cmoral,\u201d or\n\u201cphilosophical,\u201d is only likely to arise when the state of mind is weakly\ncharacterized, but in that case it will be hardly worthy of our study at\nall. With states that can only by courtesy be called religious we need\nhave nothing to do, our only profitable business being with what nobody\ncan possibly feel tempted to call anything else. I said in my former\nlecture that we learn most about a thing when we view it under a\nmicroscope, as it were, or in its most exaggerated form. This is as true\nof religious phenomena as of any other kind of fact. The only cases likely\nto be profitable enough to repay our attention will therefore be cases\nwhere the religious spirit is unmistakable and extreme. Its fainter\nmanifestations we may tranquilly pass by. Here, for example, is the total\nreaction upon life of Frederick Locker Lampson, whose autobiography,\nentitled \u201cConfidences,\u201d proves him to have been a most amiable man.\n\u201cI am so far resigned to my lot that I feel small pain at the\nthought of having to part from what has been called the pleasant\nhabit of existence, the sweet fable of life. I would not care to\nlive my wasted life over again, and so to prolong my span. Strange\nto say, I have but little wish to be younger. I submit with a\nchill at my heart. I humbly submit because it is the Divine Will,\nand my appointed destiny. I dread the increase of infirmities that\nwill make me a burden to those around me, those dear to me. No!\nlet me slip away as quietly and comfortably as I can. Let the end\ncome, if peace come with it.\n\u201cI do not know that there is a great deal to be said for this\nworld, or our sojourn here upon it; but it has pleased God so to\nplace us, and it must please me also. I ask you, what is human\nlife? Is not it a maimed happiness\u2014care and weariness, weariness\nand care, with the baseless expectation, the strange cozenage of a\nbrighter to\u2010morrow? At best it is but a froward child, that must\nbe played with and humored, to keep it quiet till it falls asleep,\nand then the care is over.\u201d(13)\nThis is a complex, a tender, a submissive, and a graceful state of mind.\nFor myself, I should have no objection to calling it on the whole a\nreligious state of mind, although I dare say that to many of you it may\nseem too listless and half\u2010hearted to merit so good a name. But what\nmatters it in the end whether we call such a state of mind religious or\nnot? It is too insignificant for our instruction in any case; and its very\npossessor wrote it down in terms which he would not have used unless he\nhad been thinking of more energetically religious moods in others, with\nwhich he found himself unable to compete. It is with these more energetic\nstates that our sole business lies, and we can perfectly well afford to\nlet the minor notes and the uncertain border go.\nIt was the extremer cases that I had in mind a little while ago when I\nsaid that personal religion, even without theology or ritual, would prove\nto embody some elements that morality pure and simple does not contain.\nYou may remember that I promised shortly to point out what those elements\nwere. In a general way I can now say what I had in mind.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\n\u201cI accept the universe\u201d is reported to have been a favorite utterance of\nour New England transcendentalist, Margaret Fuller; and when some one\nrepeated this phrase to Thomas Carlyle, his sardonic comment is said to\nhave been: \u201cGad! she\u2019d better!\u201d At bottom the whole concern of both\nmorality and religion is with the manner of our acceptance of the\nuniverse. Do we accept it only in part and grudgingly, or heartily and\naltogether? Shall our protests against certain things in it be radical and\nunforgiving, or shall we think that, even with evil, there are ways of\nliving that must lead to good? If we accept the whole, shall we do so as\nif stunned into submission,\u2014as Carlyle would have us\u2014\u201cGad! we\u2019d\nbetter!\u201d\u2014or shall we do so with enthusiastic assent? Morality pure and\nsimple accepts the law of the whole which it finds reigning, so far as to\nacknowledge and obey it, but it may obey it with the heaviest and coldest\nheart, and never cease to feel it as a yoke. But for religion, in its\nstrong and fully developed manifestations, the service of the highest\nnever is felt as a yoke. Dull submission is left far behind, and a mood of\nwelcome, which may fill any place on the scale between cheerful serenity\nand enthusiastic gladness, has taken its place.\nIt makes a tremendous emotional and practical difference to one whether\none accept the universe in the drab discolored way of stoic resignation to\nnecessity, or with the passionate happiness of Christian saints. The\ndifference is as great as that between passivity and activity, as that\nbetween the defensive and the aggressive mood. Gradual as are the steps by\nwhich an individual may grow from one state into the other, many as are\nthe intermediate stages which different individuals represent, yet when\nyou place the typical extremes beside each other for comparison, you feel\nthat two discontinuous psychological universes confront you, and that in\npassing from one to the other a \u201ccritical point\u201d has been overcome.\nIf we compare stoic with Christian ejaculations we see much more than a\ndifference of doctrine; rather is it a difference of emotional mood that\nparts them. When Marcus Aurelius reflects on the eternal reason that has\nordered things, there is a frosty chill about his words which you rarely\nfind in a Jewish, and never in a Christian piece of religious writing. The\nuniverse is \u201caccepted\u201d by all these writers; but how devoid of passion or\nexultation the spirit of the Roman Emperor is! Compare his fine sentence:\n\u201cIf gods care not for me or my children, here is a reason for it,\u201d with\nJob\u2019s cry: \u201cThough he slay me, yet will I trust in him!\u201d and you\nimmediately see the difference I mean. The _anima mundi_, to whose\ndisposal of his own personal destiny the Stoic consents, is there to be\nrespected and submitted to, but the Christian God is there to be loved;\nand the difference of emotional atmosphere is like that between an arctic\nclimate and the tropics, though the outcome in the way of accepting actual\nconditions uncomplainingly may seem in abstract terms to be much the same.\n\u201cIt is a man\u2019s duty,\u201d says Marcus Aurelius, \u201cto comfort himself\nand wait for the natural dissolution, and not to be vexed, but to\nfind refreshment solely in these thoughts\u2014first that nothing will\nhappen to me which is not conformable to the nature of the\nuniverse; and secondly that I need do nothing contrary to the God\nand deity within me; for there is no man who can compel me to\ntransgress.(14) He is an abscess on the universe who withdraws and\nseparates himself from the reason of our common nature, through\nbeing displeased with the things which happen. For the same nature\nproduces these, and has produced thee too. And so accept\neverything which happens, even if it seem disagreeable, because it\nleads to this, the health of the universe and to the prosperity\nand felicity of Zeus. For he would not have brought on any man\nwhat he has brought, if it were not useful for the whole. The\nintegrity of the whole is mutilated if thou cuttest off anything.\nAnd thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy power, when thou art\ndissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out of the\nway.\u201d(15)\nCompare now this mood with that of the old Christian author of the\nTheologia Germanica:\u2014\n\u201cWhere men are enlightened with the true light, they renounce all\ndesire and choice, and commit and commend themselves and all\nthings to the eternal Goodness, so that every enlightened man\ncould say: \u2018I would fain be to the Eternal Goodness what his own\nhand is to a man.\u2019 Such men are in a state of freedom, because\nthey have lost the fear of pain or hell, and the hope of reward or\nheaven, and are living in pure submission to the eternal Goodness,\nin the perfect freedom of fervent love. When a man truly\nperceiveth and considereth himself, who and what he is, and\nfindeth himself utterly vile and wicked and unworthy, he falleth\ninto such a deep abasement that it seemeth to him reasonable that\nall creatures in heaven and earth should rise up against him. And\ntherefore he will not and dare not desire any consolation and\nrelease; but he is willing to be unconsoled and unreleased; and he\ndoth not grieve over his sufferings, for they are right in his\neyes, and he hath nothing to say against them. This is what is\nmeant by true repentance for sin; and he who in this present time\nentereth into this hell, none may console him. Now God hath not\nforsaken a man in this hell, but He is laying his hand upon him,\nthat the man may not desire nor regard anything but the eternal\nGood only. And then, when the man neither careth for nor desireth\nanything but the eternal Good alone, and seeketh not himself nor\nhis own things, but the honour of God only, he is made a partaker\nof all manner of joy, bliss, peace, rest, and consolation, and so\nthe man is henceforth in the kingdom of heaven. This hell and this\nheaven are two good safe ways for a man, and happy is he who truly\nfindeth them.\u201d(16)\nHow much more active and positive the impulse of the Christian writer to\naccept his place in the universe is! Marcus Aurelius agrees _to_ the\nscheme\u2014the German theologian agrees _with_ it. He literally _abounds_ in\nagreement, he runs out to embrace the divine decrees.\nOccasionally, it is true, the Stoic rises to something like a Christian\nwarmth of sentiment, as in the often quoted passage of Marcus Aurelius:\u2014\n\u201cEverything harmonizes with me which is harmonious to thee, O\nUniverse. Nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in\ndue time for thee. Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons\nbring, O Nature: from thee are all things, in thee are all things,\nto thee all things return. The poet says, Dear City of Cecrops;\nand wilt thou not say, Dear City of Zeus?\u201d(17)\nBut compare even as devout a passage as this with a genuine Christian\noutpouring, and it seems a little cold. Turn, for instance, to the\nImitation of Christ:\u2014\n\u201cLord, thou knowest what is best; let this or that be according as\nthou wilt. Give what thou wilt, so much as thou wilt, when thou\nwilt. Do with me as thou knowest best, and as shall be most to\nthine honour. Place me where thou wilt, and freely work thy will\nwith me in all things.... When could it be evil when thou wert\nnear? I had rather be poor for thy sake than rich without thee. I\nchoose rather to be a pilgrim upon the earth with thee, than\nwithout thee to possess heaven. Where thou art, there is heaven;\nand where thou art not, behold there death and hell.\u201d(18)\nIt is a good rule in physiology, when we are studying the meaning of an\norgan, to ask after its most peculiar and characteristic sort of\nperformance, and to seek its office in that one of its functions which no\nother organ can possibly exert. Surely the same maxim holds good in our\npresent quest. The essence of religious experiences, the thing by which we\nfinally must judge them, must be that element or quality in them which we\ncan meet nowhere else. And such a quality will be of course most prominent\nand easy to notice in those religious experiences which are most one\u2010\nsided, exaggerated, and intense.\nNow when we compare these intenser experiences with the experiences of\ntamer minds, so cool and reasonable that we are tempted to call them\nphilosophical rather than religious, we find a character that is perfectly\ndistinct. That character, it seems to me, should be regarded as the\npractically important _differentia_ of religion for our purpose; and just\nwhat it is can easily be brought out by comparing the mind of an\nabstractly conceived Christian with that of a moralist similarly\nconceived.\nA life is manly, stoical, moral, or philosophical, we say, in proportion\nas it is less swayed by paltry personal considerations and more by\nobjective ends that call for energy, even though that energy bring\npersonal loss and pain. This is the good side of war, in so far as it\ncalls for \u201cvolunteers.\u201d And for morality life is a war, and the service of\nthe highest is a sort of cosmic patriotism which also calls for\nvolunteers. Even a sick man, unable to be militant outwardly, can carry on\nthe moral warfare. He can willfully turn his attention away from his own\nfuture, whether in this world or the next. He can train himself to\nindifference to his present drawbacks and immerse himself in whatever\nobjective interests still remain accessible. He can follow public news,\nand sympathize with other people\u2019s affairs. He can cultivate cheerful\nmanners, and be silent about his miseries. He can contemplate whatever\nideal aspects of existence his philosophy is able to present to him, and\npractice whatever duties, such as patience, resignation, trust, his\nethical system requires. Such a man lives on his loftiest, largest plane.\nHe is a high\u2010hearted freeman and no pining slave. And yet he lacks\nsomething which the Christian _par excellence_, the mystic and ascetic\nsaint, for example, has in abundant measure, and which makes of him a\nhuman being of an altogether different denomination.\nThe Christian also spurns the pinched and mumping sick\u2010room attitude, and\nthe lives of saints are full of a kind of callousness to diseased\nconditions of body which probably no other human records show. But whereas\nthe merely moralistic spurning takes an effort of volition, the Christian\nspurning is the result of the excitement of a higher kind of emotion, in\nthe presence of which no exertion of volition is required. The moralist\nmust hold his breath and keep his muscles tense; and so long as this\nathletic attitude is possible all goes well\u2014morality suffices. But the\nathletic attitude tends ever to break down, and it inevitably does break\ndown even in the most stalwart when the organism begins to decay, or when\nmorbid fears invade the mind. To suggest personal will and effort to one\nall sicklied o\u2019er with the sense of irremediable impotence is to suggest\nthe most impossible of things. What he craves is to be consoled in his\nvery powerlessness, to feel that the spirit of the universe recognizes and\nsecures him, all decaying and failing as he is. Well, we are all such\nhelpless failures in the last resort. The sanest and best of us are of one\nclay with lunatics and prison inmates, and death finally runs the\nrobustest of us down. And whenever we feel this, such a sense of the\nvanity and provisionality of our voluntary career comes over us that all\nour morality appears but as a plaster hiding a sore it can never cure, and\nall our well\u2010doing as the hollowest substitute for that well\u2010_being_ that\nour lives ought to be grounded in, but, alas! are not.\nAnd here religion comes to our rescue and takes our fate into her hands.\nThere is a state of mind, known to religious men, but to no others, in\nwhich the will to assert ourselves and hold our own has been displaced by\na willingness to close our mouths and be as nothing in the floods and\nwaterspouts of God. In this state of mind, what we most dreaded has become\nthe habitation of our safety, and the hour of our moral death has turned\ninto our spiritual birthday. The time for tension in our soul is over, and\nthat of happy relaxation, of calm deep breathing, of an eternal present,\nwith no discordant future to be anxious about, has arrived. Fear is not\nheld in abeyance as it is by mere morality, it is positively expunged and\nwashed away.\nWe shall see abundant examples of this happy state of mind in later\nlectures of this course. We shall see how infinitely passionate a thing\nreligion at its highest flights can be. Like love, like wrath, like hope,\nambition, jealousy, like every other instinctive eagerness and impulse, it\nadds to life an enchantment which is not rationally or logically deducible\nfrom anything else. This enchantment, coming as a gift when it does\ncome,\u2014a gift of our organism, the physiologists will tell us, a gift of\nGod\u2019s grace, the theologians say,\u2014is either there or not there for us, and\nthere are persons who can no more become possessed by it than they can\nfall in love with a given woman by mere word of command. Religious feeling\nis thus an absolute addition to the Subject\u2019s range of life. It gives him\na new sphere of power. When the outward battle is lost, and the outer\nworld disowns him, it redeems and vivifies an interior world which\notherwise would be an empty waste.\nIf religion is to mean anything definite for us, it seems to me that we\nought to take it as meaning this added dimension of emotion, this\nenthusiastic temper of espousal, in regions where morality strictly so\ncalled can at best but bow its head and acquiesce. It ought to mean\nnothing short of this new reach of freedom for us, with the struggle over,\nthe keynote of the universe sounding in our ears, and everlasting\npossession spread before our eyes.(19)\nThis sort of happiness in the absolute and everlasting is what we find\nnowhere but in religion. It is parted off from all mere animal happiness,\nall mere enjoyment of the present, by that element of solemnity of which I\nhave already made so much account. Solemnity is a hard thing to define\nabstractly, but certain of its marks are patent enough. A solemn state of\nmind is never crude or simple\u2014it seems to contain a certain measure of its\nown opposite in solution. A solemn joy preserves a sort of bitter in its\nsweetness; a solemn sorrow is one to which we intimately consent. But\nthere are writers who, realizing that happiness of a supreme sort is the\nprerogative of religion, forget this complication, and call all happiness,\nas such, religious. Mr. Havelock Ellis, for example, identifies religion\nwith the entire field of the soul\u2019s liberation from oppressive moods.\n\u201cThe simplest functions of physiological life,\u201d he writes, \u201cmay be\nits ministers. Every one who is at all acquainted with the Persian\nmystics knows how wine may be regarded as an instrument of\nreligion. Indeed, in all countries and in all ages, some form of\nphysical enlargement\u2014singing, dancing, drinking, sexual\nexcitement\u2014has been intimately associated with worship. Even the\nmomentary expansion of the soul in laughter is, to however slight\nan extent, a religious exercise.... Whenever an impulse from the\nworld strikes against the organism, and the resultant is not\ndiscomfort or pain, not even the muscular contraction of strenuous\nmanhood, but a joyous expansion or aspiration of the whole\nsoul\u2014there is religion. It is the infinite for which we hunger,\nand we ride gladly on every little wave that promises to bear us\ntowards it.\u201d(20)\nBut such a straight identification of religion with any and every form of\nhappiness leaves the essential peculiarity of religious happiness out. The\nmore commonplace happinesses which we get are \u201creliefs,\u201d occasioned by our\nmomentary escapes from evils either experienced or threatened. But in its\nmost characteristic embodiments, religious happiness is no mere feeling of\nescape. It cares no longer to escape. It consents to the evil outwardly as\na form of sacrifice\u2014inwardly it knows it to be permanently overcome. If\nyou ask _how_ religion thus falls on the thorns and faces death, and in\nthe very act annuls annihilation, I cannot explain the matter, for it is\nreligion\u2019s secret, and to understand it you must yourself have been a\nreligious man of the extremer type. In our future examples, even of the\nsimplest and healthiest\u2010minded type of religious consciousness, we shall\nfind this complex sacrificial constitution, in which a higher happiness\nholds a lower unhappiness in check. In the Louvre there is a picture, by\nGuido Reni, of St. Michael with his foot on Satan\u2019s neck. The richness of\nthe picture is in large part due to the fiend\u2019s figure being there. The\nrichness of its allegorical meaning also is due to his being there\u2014that\nis, the world is all the richer for having a devil in it, _so long as we\nkeep our foot upon his neck_. In the religious consciousness, that is just\nthe position in which the fiend, the negative or tragic principle, is\nfound; and for that very reason the religious consciousness is so rich\nfrom the emotional point of view.(21) We shall see how in certain men and\nwomen it takes on a monstrously ascetic form. There are saints who have\nliterally fed on the negative principle, on humiliation and privation, and\nthe thought of suffering and death,\u2014their souls growing in happiness just\nin proportion as their outward state grew more intolerable. No other\nemotion than religious emotion can bring a man to this peculiar pass. And\nit is for that reason that when we ask our question about the value of\nreligion for human life, I think we ought to look for the answer among\nthese violenter examples rather than among those of a more moderate hue.\nHaving the phenomenon of our study in its acutest possible form to start\nwith, we can shade down as much as we please later. And if in these cases,\nrepulsive as they are to our ordinary worldly way of judging, we find\nourselves compelled to acknowledge religion\u2019s value and treat it with\nrespect, it will have proved in some way its value for life at large. By\nsubtracting and toning down extravagances we may thereupon proceed to\ntrace the boundaries of its legitimate sway.\nTo be sure, it makes our task difficult to have to deal so much with\neccentricities and extremes. \u201cHow _can_ religion on the whole be the most\nimportant of all human functions,\u201d you may ask, \u201cif every several\nmanifestation of it in turn have to be corrected and sobered down and\npruned away?\u201d Such a thesis seems a paradox impossible to sustain\nreasonably,\u2014yet I believe that something like it will have to be our final\ncontention. That personal attitude which the individual finds himself\nimpelled to take up towards what he apprehends to be the divine\u2014and you\nwill remember that this was our definition\u2014will prove to be both a\nhelpless and a sacrificial attitude. That is, we shall have to confess to\nat least some amount of dependence on sheer mercy, and to practice some\namount of renunciation, great or small, to save our souls alive. The\nconstitution of the world we live in requires it:\u2014\n\u201cEntbehren sollst du! sollst entbehren!\nDas ist der ewige Gesang\nDer jedem an die Ohren klingt,\nDen, unser ganzes Leben lang\nUns heiser jede Stunde singt.\u201d\nFor when all is said and done, we are in the end absolutely dependent on\nthe universe; and into sacrifices and surrenders of some sort,\ndeliberately looked at and accepted, we are drawn and pressed as into our\nonly permanent positions of repose. Now in those states of mind which fall\nshort of religion, the surrender is submitted to as an imposition of\nnecessity, and the sacrifice is undergone at the very best without\ncomplaint. In the religious life, on the contrary, surrender and sacrifice\nare positively espoused: even unnecessary givings\u2010up are added in order\nthat the happiness may increase. _Religion thus makes easy and felicitous\nwhat in any case is necessary_; and if it be the only agency that can\naccomplish this result, its vital importance as a human faculty stands\nvindicated beyond dispute. It becomes an essential organ of our life,\nperforming a function which no other portion of our nature can so\nsuccessfully fulfill. From the merely biological point of view, so to call\nit, this is a conclusion to which, so far as I can now see, we shall\ninevitably be led, and led moreover by following the purely empirical\nmethod of demonstration which I sketched to you in the first lecture. Of\nthe farther office of religion as a metaphysical revelation I will say\nnothing now.\nBut to foreshadow the terminus of one\u2019s investigations is one thing, and\nto arrive there safely is another. In the next lecture, abandoning the\nextreme generalities which have engrossed us hitherto, I propose that we\nbegin our actual journey by addressing ourselves directly to the concrete\nfacts.\nLECTURE III. THE REALITY OF THE UNSEEN.\nWere one asked to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and\nmost general terms possible, one might say that it consists of the belief\nthat there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in\nharmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. This belief and this adjustment\nare the religious attitude in the soul. I wish during this hour to call\nyour attention to some of the psychological peculiarities of such an\nattitude as this, of belief in an object which we cannot see. All our\nattitudes, moral, practical, or emotional, as well as religious, are due\nto the \u201cobjects\u201d of our consciousness, the things which we believe to\nexist, whether really or ideally, along with ourselves. Such objects may\nbe present to our senses, or they may be present only to our thought. In\neither case they elicit from us a _reaction_; and the reaction due to\nthings of thought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due to\nsensible presences. It may be even stronger. The memory of an insult may\nmake us angrier than the insult did when we received it. We are frequently\nmore ashamed of our blunders afterwards than we were at the moment of\nmaking them; and in general our whole higher prudential and moral life is\nbased on the fact that material sensations actually present may have a\nweaker influence on our action than ideas of remoter facts.\nThe more concrete objects of most men\u2019s religion, the deities whom they\nworship, are known to them only in idea. It has been vouchsafed, for\nexample, to very few Christian believers to have had a sensible vision of\ntheir Saviour; though enough appearances of this sort are on record, by\nway of miraculous exception, to merit our attention later. The whole force\nof the Christian religion, therefore, so far as belief in the divine\npersonages determines the prevalent attitude of the believer, is in\ngeneral exerted by the instrumentality of pure ideas, of which nothing in\nthe individual\u2019s past experience directly serves as a model.\nBut in addition to these ideas of the more concrete religious objects,\nreligion is full of abstract objects which prove to have an equal power.\nGod\u2019s attributes as such, his holiness, his justice, his mercy, his\nabsoluteness, his infinity, his omniscience, his tri\u2010unity, the various\nmysteries of the redemptive process, the operation of the sacraments,\netc., have proved fertile wells of inspiring meditation for Christian\nbelievers.(22) We shall see later that the absence of definite sensible\nimages is positively insisted on by the mystical authorities in all\nreligions as the _sine qua non_ of a successful orison, or contemplation\nof the higher divine truths. Such contemplations are expected (and\nabundantly verify the expectation, as we shall also see) to influence the\nbeliever\u2019s subsequent attitude very powerfully for good.\nImmanuel Kant held a curious doctrine about such objects of belief as God,\nthe design of creation, the soul, its freedom, and the life hereafter.\nThese things, he said, are properly not objects of knowledge at all. Our\nconceptions always require a sense\u2010content to work with, and as the words\n\u201csoul,\u201d \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cimmortality,\u201d cover no distinctive sense\u2010content whatever,\nit follows that theoretically speaking they are words devoid of any\nsignificance. Yet strangely enough they have a definite meaning _for our\npractice_. We can act _as if_ there were a God; feel _as if_ we were free;\nconsider Nature _as if_ she were full of special designs; lay plans _as\nif_ we were to be immortal; and we find then that these words do make a\ngenuine difference in our moral life. Our faith _that_ these\nunintelligible objects actually exist proves thus to be a full equivalent\nin _praktischer Hinsicht_, as Kant calls it, or from the point of view of\nour action, for a knowledge of _what_ they might be, in case we were\npermitted positively to conceive them. So we have the strange phenomenon,\nas Kant assures us, of a mind believing with all its strength in the real\npresence of a set of things of no one of which it can form any notion\nwhatsoever.\nMy object in thus recalling Kant\u2019s doctrine to your mind is not to express\nany opinion as to the accuracy of this particularly uncouth part of his\nphilosophy, but only to illustrate the characteristic of human nature\nwhich we are considering, by an example so classical in its exaggeration.\nThe sentiment of reality can indeed attach itself so strongly to our\nobject of belief that our whole life is polarized through and through, so\nto speak, by its sense of the existence of the thing believed in, and yet\nthat thing, for purpose of definite description, can hardly be said to be\npresent to our mind at all. It is as if a bar of iron, without touch or\nsight, with no representative faculty whatever, might nevertheless be\nstrongly endowed with an inner capacity for magnetic feeling; and as if,\nthrough the various arousals of its magnetism by magnets coming and going\nin its neighborhood, it might be consciously determined to different\nattitudes and tendencies. Such a bar of iron could never give you an\noutward description of the agencies that had the power of stirring it so\nstrongly; yet of their presence, and of their significance for its life,\nit would be intensely aware through every fibre of its being.\nIt is not only the Ideas of pure Reason, as Kant styled them, that have\nthis power of making us vitally feel presences that we are impotent\narticulately to describe. All sorts of higher abstractions bring with them\nthe same kind of impalpable appeal. Remember those passages from Emerson\nwhich I read at my last lecture. The whole universe of concrete objects,\nas we know them, swims, not only for such a transcendentalist writer, but\nfor all of us, in a wider and higher universe of abstract ideas, that lend\nit its significance. As time, space, and the ether soak through all\nthings, so (we feel) do abstract and essential goodness, beauty, strength,\nsignificance, justice, soak through all things good, strong, significant,\nand just.\nSuch ideas, and others equally abstract, form the background for all our\nfacts, the fountain\u2010head of all the possibilities we conceive of. They\ngive its \u201cnature,\u201d as we call it, to every special thing. Everything we\nknow is \u201cwhat\u201d it is by sharing in the nature of one of these\nabstractions. We can never look directly at them, for they are bodiless\nand featureless and footless, but we grasp all other things by their\nmeans, and in handling the real world we should be stricken with\nhelplessness in just so far forth as we might lose these mental objects,\nthese adjectives and adverbs and predicates and heads of classification\nand conception.\nThis absolute determinability of our mind by abstractions is one of the\ncardinal facts in our human constitution. Polarizing and magnetizing us as\nthey do, we turn towards them and from them, we seek them, hold them, hate\nthem, bless them, just as if they were so many concrete beings. And beings\nthey are, beings as real in the realm which they inhabit as the changing\nthings of sense are in the realm of space.\nPlato gave so brilliant and impressive a defense of this common human\nfeeling, that the doctrine of the reality of abstract objects has been\nknown as the platonic theory of ideas ever since. Abstract Beauty, for\nexample, is for Plato a perfectly definite individual being, of which the\nintellect is aware as of something additional to all the perishing\nbeauties of the earth. \u201cThe true order of going,\u201d he says, in the often\nquoted passage in his \u201cBanquet,\u201d \u201cis to use the beauties of earth as steps\nalong which one mounts upwards for the sake of that other Beauty, going\nfrom one to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to\nfair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair\nnotions he arrives at the notion of absolute Beauty, and at last knows\nwhat the essence of Beauty is.\u201d(23) In our last lecture we had a glimpse\nof the way in which a platonizing writer like Emerson may treat the\nabstract divineness of things, the moral structure of the universe, as a\nfact worthy of worship. In those various churches without a God which to\u2010\nday are spreading through the world under the name of ethical societies,\nwe have a similar worship of the abstract divine, the moral law believed\nin as an ultimate object. \u201cScience\u201d in many minds is genuinely taking the\nplace of a religion. Where this is so, the scientist treats the \u201cLaws of\nNature\u201d as objective facts to be revered. A brilliant school of\ninterpretation of Greek mythology would have it that in their origin the\nGreek gods were only half\u2010metaphoric personifications of those great\nspheres of abstract law and order into which the natural world falls\napart\u2014the sky\u2010sphere, the ocean\u2010sphere, the earth\u2010sphere, and the like;\njust as even now we may speak of the smile of the morning, the kiss of the\nbreeze, or the bite of the cold, without really meaning that these\nphenomena of nature actually wear a human face.(24)\nAs regards the origin of the Greek gods, we need not at present seek an\nopinion. But the whole array of our instances leads to a conclusion\nsomething like this: It is as if there were in the human consciousness a\n_sense of reality, a feeling of objective presence, a perception_ of what\nwe may call \u201c_something there_,\u201d more deep and more general than any of\nthe special and particular \u201csenses\u201d by which the current psychology\nsupposes existent realities to be originally revealed. If this were so, we\nmight suppose the senses to waken our attitudes and conduct as they so\nhabitually do, by first exciting this sense of reality; but anything else,\nany idea, for example, that might similarly excite it, would have that\nsame prerogative of appearing real which objects of sense normally\npossess. So far as religious conceptions were able to touch this reality\u2010\nfeeling, they would be believed in in spite of criticism, even though they\nmight be so vague and remote as to be almost unimaginable, even though\nthey might be such non\u2010entities in point of _whatness_, as Kant makes the\nobjects of his moral theology to be.\nThe most curious proofs of the existence of such an undifferentiated sense\nof reality as this are found in experiences of hallucination. It often\nhappens that an hallucination is imperfectly developed: the person\naffected will feel a \u201cpresence\u201d in the room, definitely localized, facing\nin one particular way, real in the most emphatic sense of the word, often\ncoming suddenly, and as suddenly gone; and yet neither seen, heard,\ntouched, nor cognized in any of the usual \u201csensible\u201d ways. Let me give you\nan example of this, before I pass to the objects with whose presence\nreligion is more peculiarly concerned.\nAn intimate friend of mine, one of the keenest intellects I know, has had\nseveral experiences of this sort. He writes as follows in response to my\ninquiries:\u2014\n\u201cI have several times within the past few years felt the so\u2010called\n\u2018consciousness of a presence.\u2019 The experiences which I have in\nmind are clearly distinguishable from another kind of experience\nwhich I have had very frequently, and which I fancy many persons\nwould also call the \u2018consciousness of a presence.\u2019 But the\ndifference for me between the two sets of experience is as great\nas the difference between feeling a slight warmth originating I\nknow not where, and standing in the midst of a conflagration with\nall the ordinary senses alert.\n\u201cIt was about September, 1884, when I had the first experience. On\nthe previous night I had had, after getting into bed at my rooms\nin College, a vivid tactile hallucination of being grasped by the\narm, which made me get up and search the room for an intruder; but\nthe sense of presence properly so called came on the next night.\nAfter I had got into bed and blown out the candle, I lay awake\nawhile thinking on the previous night\u2019s experience, when suddenly\nI _felt_ something come into the room and stay close to my bed. It\nremained only a minute or two. I did not recognize it by any\nordinary sense, and yet there was a horribly unpleasant\n\u2018sensation\u2019 connected with it. It stirred something more at the\nroots of my being than any ordinary perception. The feeling had\nsomething of the quality of a very large tearing vital pain\nspreading chiefly over the chest, but within the organism\u2014and yet\nthe feeling was not _pain_ so much as _abhorrence_. At all events,\nsomething was present with me, and I knew its presence far more\nsurely than I have ever known the presence of any fleshly living\ncreature. I was conscious of its departure as of its coming: an\nalmost instantaneously swift going through the door, and the\n\u2018horrible sensation\u2019 disappeared.\n\u201cOn the third night when I retired my mind was absorbed in some\nlectures which I was preparing, and I was still absorbed in these\nwhen I became aware of the actual presence (though not of the\n_coming_) of the thing that was there the night before, and of the\n\u2018horrible sensation.\u2019 I then mentally concentrated all my effort\nto charge this \u2018thing,\u2019 if it was evil, to depart, if it was _not_\nevil, to tell me who or what it was, and if it could not explain\nitself, to go, and that I would compel it to go. It went as on the\nprevious night, and my body quickly recovered its normal state.\n\u201cOn two other occasions in my life I have had precisely the same\n\u2018horrible sensation.\u2019 Once it lasted a full quarter of an hour. In\nall three instances the certainty that there in outward space\nthere stood _something_ was indescribably _stronger_ than the\nordinary certainty of companionship when we are in the close\npresence of ordinary living people. The something seemed close to\nme, and intensely more real than any ordinary perception. Although\nI felt it to be like unto myself, so to speak, or finite, small,\nand distressful, as it were, I didn\u2019t recognize it as any\nindividual being or person.\u201d\nOf course such an experience as this does not connect itself with the\nreligious sphere. Yet it may upon occasion do so; and the same\ncorrespondent informs me that at more than one other conjuncture he had\nthe sense of presence developed with equal intensity and abruptness, only\nthen it was filled with a quality of joy.\n\u201cThere was not a mere consciousness of something there, but fused\nin the central happiness of it, a startling awareness of some\nineffable good. Not vague either, not like the emotional effect of\nsome poem, or scene, or blossom, of music, but the sure knowledge\nof the close presence of a sort of mighty person, and after it\nwent, the memory persisted as the one perception of reality.\nEverything else might be a dream, but not that.\u201d\nMy friend, as it oddly happens, does not interpret these latter\nexperiences theistically, as signifying the presence of God. But it would\nclearly not have been unnatural to interpret them as a revelation of the\ndeity\u2019s existence. When we reach the subject of mysticism, we shall have\nmuch more to say upon this head.\nLest the oddity of these phenomena should disconcert you, I will venture\nto read you a couple of similar narratives, much shorter, merely to show\nthat we are dealing with a well\u2010marked natural kind of fact. In the first\ncase, which I take from the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research,\nthe sense of presence developed in a few moments into a distinctly\nvisualized hallucination,\u2014but I leave that part of the story out.\n\u201cI had read,\u201d the narrator says, \u201csome twenty minutes or so, was\nthoroughly absorbed in the book, my mind was perfectly quiet, and\nfor the time being my friends were quite forgotten, when suddenly\nwithout a moment\u2019s warning my whole being seemed roused to the\nhighest state of tension or aliveness, and I was aware, with an\nintenseness not easily imagined by those who had never experienced\nit, that another being or presence was not only in the room, but\nquite close to me. I put my book down, and although my excitement\nwas great, I felt quite collected, and not conscious of any sense\nof fear. Without changing my position, and looking straight at the\nfire, I knew somehow that my friend A. H. was standing at my left\nelbow, but so far behind me as to be hidden by the armchair in\nwhich I was leaning back. Moving my eyes round slightly without\notherwise changing my position, the lower portion of one leg\nbecame visible, and I instantly recognized the gray\u2010blue material\nof trousers he often wore, but the stuff appeared semi\u2010\ntransparent, reminding me of tobacco smoke in\nconsistency,\u201d(25)\u2014and hereupon the visual hallucination came.\nAnother informant writes:\u2014\n\u201cQuite early in the night I was awakened.... I felt as if I had\nbeen aroused intentionally, and at first thought some one was\nbreaking into the house.... I then turned on my side to go to\nsleep again, and immediately felt a consciousness of a presence in\nthe room, and singular to state, it was not the consciousness of a\nlive person, but of a spiritual presence. This may provoke a\nsmile, but I can only tell you the facts as they occurred to me. I\ndo not know how to better describe my sensations than by simply\nstating that I felt a consciousness of a spiritual presence.... I\nfelt also at the same time a strong feeling of superstitious\ndread, as if something strange and fearful were about to\nhappen.\u201d(26)\nProfessor Flournoy of Geneva gives me the following testimony of a friend\nof his, a lady, who has the gift of automatic or involuntary writing:\u2014\n\u201cWhenever I practice automatic writing, what makes me feel that it\nis not due to a subconscious self is the feeling I always have of\na foreign presence, external to my body. It is sometimes so\ndefinitely characterized that I could point to its exact position.\nThis impression of presence is impossible to describe. It varies\nin intensity and clearness according to the personality from whom\nthe writing professes to come. If it is some one whom I love, I\nfeel it immediately, before any writing has come. My heart seems\nto recognize it.\u201d\nIn an earlier book of mine I have cited at full length a curious case of\npresence felt by a blind man. The presence was that of the figure of a\ngray\u2010bearded man dressed in a pepper and salt suit, squeezing himself\nunder the crack of the door and moving across the floor of the room\ntowards a sofa. The blind subject of this quasi\u2010hallucination is an\nexceptionally intelligent reporter. He is entirely without internal visual\nimagery and cannot represent light or colors to himself, and is positive\nthat his other senses, hearing, etc., were not involved in this false\nperception. It seems to have been an abstract conception rather, with the\nfeelings of reality and spatial outwardness directly attached to it\u2014in\nother words, a fully objectified and exteriorized _idea_.\nSuch cases, taken along with others which would be too tedious for\nquotation, seem sufficiently to prove the existence in our mental\nmachinery of a sense of present reality more diffused and general than\nthat which our special senses yield. For the psychologists the tracing of\nthe organic seat of such a feeling would form a pretty problem\u2014nothing\ncould be more natural than to connect it with the muscular sense, with the\nfeeling that our muscles were innervating themselves for action.\nWhatsoever thus innervated our activity, or \u201cmade our flesh creep,\u201d\u2014our\nsenses are what do so oftenest,\u2014might then appear real and present, even\nthough it were but an abstract idea. But with such vague conjectures we\nhave no concern at present, for our interest lies with the faculty rather\nthan with its organic seat.\nLike all positive affections of consciousness, the sense of reality has\nits negative counterpart in the shape of a feeling of unreality by which\npersons may be haunted, and of which one sometimes hears complaint:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I reflect on the fact that I have made my appearance by\naccident upon a globe itself whirled through space as the sport of\nthe catastrophes of the heavens,\u201d says Madame Ackermann; \u201cwhen I\nsee myself surrounded by beings as ephemeral and incomprehensible\nas I am myself, and all excitedly pursuing pure chimeras, I\nexperience a strange feeling of being in a dream. It seems to me\nas if I have loved and suffered and that erelong I shall die, in a\ndream. My last word will be, \u2018I have been dreaming.\u2019 \u201d(27)\nIn another lecture we shall see how in morbid melancholy this sense of the\nunreality of things may become a carking pain, and even lead to suicide.\nWe may now lay it down as certain that in the distinctively religious\nsphere of experience, many persons (how many we cannot tell) possess the\nobjects of their belief, not in the form of mere conceptions which their\nintellect accepts as true, but rather in the form of quasi\u2010sensible\nrealities directly apprehended. As his sense of the real presence of these\nobjects fluctuates, so the believer alternates between warmth and coldness\nin his faith. Other examples will bring this home to one better than\nabstract description, so I proceed immediately to cite some. The first\nexample is a negative one, deploring the loss of the sense in question. I\nhave extracted it from an account given me by a scientific man of my\nacquaintance, of his religious life. It seems to me to show clearly that\nthe feeling of reality may be something more like a sensation than an\nintellectual operation properly so\u2010called.\n\u201cBetween twenty and thirty I gradually became more and more\nagnostic and irreligious, yet I cannot say that I ever lost that\n\u2018indefinite consciousness\u2019 which Herbert Spencer describes so\nwell, of an Absolute Reality behind phenomena. For me this Reality\nwas not the pure Unknowable of Spencer\u2019s philosophy, for although\nI had ceased my childish prayers to God, and never prayed to _It_\nin a formal manner, yet my more recent experience shows me to have\nbeen in a relation to _It_ which practically was the same thing as\nprayer. Whenever I had any trouble, especially when I had conflict\nwith other people, either domestically or in the way of business,\nor when I was depressed in spirits or anxious about affairs, I now\nrecognize that I used to fall back for support upon this curious\nrelation I felt myself to be in to this fundamental cosmical _It_.\nIt was on my side, or I was on Its side, however you please to\nterm it, in the particular trouble, and it always strengthened me\nand seemed to give me endless vitality to feel its underlying and\nsupporting presence. In fact, it was an unfailing fountain of\nliving justice, truth, and strength, to which I instinctively\nturned at times of weakness, and it always brought me out. I know\nnow that it was a personal relation I was in to it, because of\nlate years the power of communicating with it has left me, and I\nam conscious of a perfectly definite loss. I used never to fail to\nfind it when I turned to it. Then came a set of years when\nsometimes I found it, and then again I would be wholly unable to\nmake connection with it. I remember many occasions on which at\nnight in bed, I would be unable to get to sleep on account of\nworry. I turned this way and that in the darkness, and groped\nmentally for the familiar sense of that higher mind of my mind\nwhich had always seemed to be close at hand as it were, closing\nthe passage, and yielding support, but there was no electric\ncurrent. A blank was there instead of _It_: I couldn\u2019t find\nanything. Now, at the age of nearly fifty, my power of getting\ninto connection with it has entirely left me; and I have to\nconfess that a great help has gone out of my life. Life has become\ncuriously dead and indifferent; and I can now see that my old\nexperience was probably exactly the same thing as the prayers of\nthe orthodox, only I did not call them by that name. What I have\nspoken of as \u2018It\u2019 was practically not Spencer\u2019s Unknowable, but\njust my own instinctive and individual God, whom I relied upon for\nhigher sympathy, but whom somehow I have lost.\u201d\nNothing is more common in the pages of religious biography than the way in\nwhich seasons of lively and of difficult faith are described as\nalternating. Probably every religious person has the recollection of\nparticular crises in which a directer vision of the truth, a direct\nperception, perhaps, of a living God\u2019s existence, swept in and overwhelmed\nthe languor of the more ordinary belief. In James Russell Lowell\u2019s\ncorrespondence there is a brief memorandum of an experience of this kind:\u2014\n\u201cI had a revelation last Friday evening. I was at Mary\u2019s, and\nhappening to say something of the presence of spirits (of whom, I\nsaid, I was often dimly aware), Mr. Putnam entered into an\nargument with me on spiritual matters. As I was speaking, the\nwhole system rose up before me like a vague destiny looming from\nthe Abyss. I never before so clearly felt the Spirit of God in me\nand around me. The whole room seemed to me full of God. The air\nseemed to waver to and fro with the presence of Something I knew\nnot what. I spoke with the calmness and clearness of a prophet. I\ncannot tell you what this revelation was. I have not yet studied\nit enough. But I shall perfect it one day, and then you shall hear\nit and acknowledge its grandeur.\u201d(28)\nHere is a longer and more developed experience from a manuscript\ncommunication by a clergyman,\u2014I take it from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript\ncollection:\u2014\n\u201cI remember the night, and almost the very spot on the hilltop,\nwhere my soul opened out, as it were, into the Infinite, and there\nwas a rushing together of the two worlds, the inner and the outer.\nIt was deep calling unto deep,\u2014the deep that my own struggle had\nopened up within being answered by the unfathomable deep without,\nreaching beyond the stars. I stood alone with Him who had made me,\nand all the beauty of the world, and love, and sorrow, and even\ntemptation. I did not seek Him, but felt the perfect unison of my\nspirit with His. The ordinary sense of things around me faded. For\nthe moment nothing but an ineffable joy and exaltation remained.\nIt is impossible fully to describe the experience. It was like the\neffect of some great orchestra when all the separate notes have\nmelted into one swelling harmony that leaves the listener\nconscious of nothing save that his soul is being wafted upwards,\nand almost bursting with its own emotion. The perfect stillness of\nthe night was thrilled by a more solemn silence. The darkness held\na presence that was all the more felt because it was not seen. I\ncould not any more have doubted that _He_ was there than that I\nwas. Indeed, I felt myself to be, if possible, the less real of\nthe two.\n\u201cMy highest faith in God and truest idea of him were then born in\nme. I have stood upon the Mount of Vision since, and felt the\nEternal round about me. But never since has there come quite the\nsame stirring of the heart. Then, if ever, I believe, I stood face\nto face with God, and was born anew of his spirit. There was, as I\nrecall it, no sudden change of thought or of belief, except that\nmy early crude conception had, as it were, burst into flower.\nThere was no destruction of the old, but a rapid, wonderful\nunfolding. Since that time no discussion that I have heard of the\nproofs of God\u2019s existence has been able to shake my faith. Having\nonce felt the presence of God\u2019s spirit, I have never lost it again\nfor long. My most assuring evidence of his existence is deeply\nrooted in that hour of vision, in the memory of that supreme\nexperience, and in the conviction, gained from reading and\nreflection, that something the same has come to all who have found\nGod. I am aware that it may justly be called mystical. I am not\nenough acquainted with philosophy to defend it from that or any\nother charge. I feel that in writing of it I have overlaid it with\nwords rather than put it clearly to your thought. But, such as it\nis, I have described it as carefully as I now am able to do.\u201d\nHere is another document, even more definite in character, which, the\nwriter being a Swiss, I translate from the French original.(29)\n\u201cI was in perfect health: we were on our sixth day of tramping,\nand in good training. We had come the day before from Sixt to\nTrient by Buet. I felt neither fatigue, hunger, nor thirst, and my\nstate of mind was equally healthy. I had had at Forlaz good news\nfrom home; I was subject to no anxiety, either near or remote, for\nwe had a good guide, and there was not a shadow of uncertainty\nabout the road we should follow. I can best describe the condition\nin which I was by calling it a state of equilibrium. When all at\nonce I experienced a feeling of being raised above myself, I felt\nthe presence of God\u2014I tell of the thing just as I was conscious of\nit\u2014as if his goodness and his power were penetrating me\naltogether. The throb of emotion was so violent that I could\nbarely tell the boys to pass on and not wait for me. I then sat\ndown on a stone, unable to stand any longer, and my eyes\noverflowed with tears. I thanked God that in the course of my life\nhe had taught me to know him, that he sustained my life and took\npity both on the insignificant creature and on the sinner that I\nwas. I begged him ardently that my life might be consecrated to\nthe doing of his will. I felt his reply, which was that I should\ndo his will from day to day, in humility and poverty, leaving him,\nthe Almighty God, to be judge of whether I should some time be\ncalled to bear witness more conspicuously. Then, slowly, the\necstasy left my heart; that is, I felt that God had withdrawn the\ncommunion which he had granted, and I was able to walk on, but\nvery slowly, so strongly was I still possessed by the interior\nemotion. Besides, I had wept uninterruptedly for several minutes,\nmy eyes were swollen, and I did not wish my companions to see me.\nThe state of ecstasy may have lasted four or five minutes,\nalthough it seemed at the time to last much longer. My comrades\nwaited for me ten minutes at the cross of Barine, but I took about\ntwenty\u2010five or thirty minutes to join them, for as well as I can\nremember, they said that I had kept them back for about half an\nhour. The impression had been so profound that in climbing slowly\nthe slope I asked myself if it were possible that Moses on Sinai\ncould have had a more intimate communication with God. I think it\nwell to add that in this ecstasy of mine God had neither form,\ncolor, odor, nor taste; moreover, that the feeling of his presence\nwas accompanied with no determinate localization. It was rather as\nif my personality had been transformed by the presence of a\n_spiritual spirit_. But the more I seek words to express this\nintimate intercourse, the more I feel the impossibility of\ndescribing the thing by any of our usual images. At bottom the\nexpression most apt to render what I felt is this: God was\npresent, though invisible; he fell under no one of my senses, yet\nmy consciousness perceived him.\u201d\nThe adjective \u201cmystical\u201d is technically applied, most often, to states\nthat are of brief duration. Of course such hours of rapture as the last\ntwo persons describe are mystical experiences, of which in a later lecture\nI shall have much to say. Meanwhile here is the abridged record of another\nmystical or semi\u2010mystical experience, in a mind evidently framed by nature\nfor ardent piety. I owe it to Starbuck\u2019s collection. The lady who gives\nthe account is the daughter of a man well known in his time as a writer\nagainst Christianity. The suddenness of her conversion shows well how\nnative the sense of God\u2019s presence must be to certain minds. She relates\nthat she was brought up in entire ignorance of Christian doctrine, but,\nwhen in Germany, after being talked to by Christian friends, she read the\nBible and prayed, and finally the plan of salvation flashed upon her like\na stream of light.\n\u201cTo this day,\u201d she writes, \u201cI cannot understand dallying with\nreligion and the commands of God. The very instant I heard my\nFather\u2019s cry calling unto me, my heart bounded in recognition. I\nran, I stretched forth my arms, I cried aloud, \u2018Here, here I am,\nmy Father.\u2019 Oh, happy child, what should I do? \u2018Love me,\u2019 answered\nmy God. \u2018I do, I do,\u2019 I cried passionately. \u2018Come unto me,\u2019 called\nmy Father. \u2018I will,\u2019 my heart panted. Did I stop to ask a single\nquestion? Not one. It never occurred to me to ask whether I was\ngood enough, or to hesitate over my unfitness, or to find out what\nI thought of his church, or ... to wait until I should be\nsatisfied. Satisfied! I was satisfied. Had I not found my God and\nmy Father? Did he not love me? Had he not called me? Was there not\na Church into which I might enter?... Since then I have had direct\nanswers to prayer\u2014so significant as to be almost like talking with\nGod and hearing his answer. The idea of God\u2019s reality has never\nleft me for one moment.\u201d\nHere is still another case, the writer being a man aged twenty\u2010seven, in\nwhich the experience, probably almost as characteristic, is less vividly\ndescribed:\u2014\n\u201cI have on a number of occasions felt that I had enjoyed a period\nof intimate communion with the divine. These meetings came unasked\nand unexpected, and seemed to consist merely in the temporary\nobliteration of the conventionalities which usually surround and\ncover my life.... Once it was when from the summit of a high\nmountain I looked over a gashed and corrugated landscape extending\nto a long convex of ocean that ascended to the horizon, and again\nfrom the same point when I could see nothing beneath me but a\nboundless expanse of white cloud, on the blown surface of which a\nfew high peaks, including the one I was on, seemed plunging about\nas if they were dragging their anchors. What I felt on these\noccasions was a temporary loss of my own identity, accompanied by\nan illumination which revealed to me a deeper significance than I\nhad been wont to attach to life. It is in this that I find my\njustification for saying that I have enjoyed communication with\nGod. Of course the absence of such a being as this would be chaos.\nI cannot conceive of life without its presence.\u201d\nOf the more habitual and so to speak chronic sense of God\u2019s presence the\nfollowing sample from Professor Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection may serve\nto give an idea. It is from a man aged forty\u2010nine,\u2014probably thousands of\nunpretending Christians would write an almost identical account.\n\u201cGod is more real to me than any thought or thing or person. I\nfeel his presence positively, and the more as I live in closer\nharmony with his laws as written in my body and mind. I feel him\nin the sunshine or rain; and awe mingled with a delicious\nrestfulness most nearly describes my feelings. I talk to him as to\na companion in prayer and praise, and our communion is delightful.\nHe answers me again and again, often in words so clearly spoken\nthat it seems my outer ear must have carried the tone, but\ngenerally in strong mental impressions. Usually a text of\nScripture, unfolding some new view of him and his love for me, and\ncare for my safety. I could give hundreds of instances, in school\nmatters, social problems, financial difficulties, etc. That he is\nmine and I am his never leaves me, it is an abiding joy. Without\nit life would be a blank, a desert, a shoreless, trackless waste.\u201d\nI subjoin some more examples from writers of different ages and sexes.\nThey are also from Professor Starbuck\u2019s collection, and their number might\nbe greatly multiplied. The first is from a man twenty\u2010seven years old:\u2014\n\u201cGod is quite real to me. I talk to him and often get answers.\nThoughts sudden and distinct from any I have been entertaining\ncome to my mind after asking God for his direction. Something over\na year ago I was for some weeks in the direst perplexity. When the\ntrouble first appeared before me I was dazed, but before long (two\nor three hours) I could hear distinctly a passage of Scripture:\n\u2018My grace is sufficient for thee.\u2019 Every time my thoughts turned\nto the trouble I could hear this quotation. I don\u2019t think I ever\ndoubted the existence of God, or had him drop out of my\nconsciousness. God has frequently stepped into my affairs very\nperceptibly, and I feel that he directs many little details all\nthe time. But on two or three occasions he has ordered ways for me\nvery contrary to my ambitions and plans.\u201d\nAnother statement (none the less valuable psychologically for being so\ndecidedly childish) is that of a boy of seventeen:\u2014\n\u201cSometimes as I go to church, I sit down, join in the service, and\nbefore I go out I feel as if God was with me, right side of me,\nsinging and reading the Psalms with me.... And then again I feel\nas if I could sit beside him, and put my arms around him, kiss\nhim, etc. When I am taking Holy Communion at the altar, I try to\nget with him and generally feel his presence.\u201d\nI let a few other cases follow at random:\u2014\n\u201cGod surrounds me like the physical atmosphere. He is closer to me\nthan my own breath. In him literally I live and move and have my\nbeing.\u201d\u2014\n\u201cThere are times when I seem to stand, in his very presence, to\ntalk with him. Answers to prayer have come, sometimes direct and\noverwhelming in their revelation of his presence and powers. There\nare times when God seems far off, but this is always my own\nfault.\u201d\u2014\n\u201cI have the sense of a presence, strong, and at the same time\nsoothing, which hovers over me. Sometimes it seems to enwrap me\nwith sustaining arms.\u201d\nSuch is the human ontological imagination, and such is the convincingness\nof what it brings to birth. Unpicturable beings are realized, and realized\nwith an intensity almost like that of an hallucination. They determine our\nvital attitude as decisively as the vital attitude of lovers is determined\nby the habitual sense, by which each is haunted, of the other being in the\nworld. A lover has notoriously this sense of the continuous being of his\nidol, even when his attention is addressed to other matters and he no\nlonger represents her features. He cannot forget her; she uninterruptedly\naffects him through and through.\nI spoke of the convincingness of these feelings of reality, and I must\ndwell a moment longer on that point. They are as convincing to those who\nhave them as any direct sensible experiences can be, and they are, as a\nrule, much more convincing than results established by mere logic ever\nare. One may indeed be entirely without them; probably more than one of\nyou here present is without them in any marked degree; but if you do have\nthem, and have them at all strongly, the probability is that you cannot\nhelp regarding them as genuine perceptions of truth, as revelations of a\nkind of reality which no adverse argument, however unanswerable by you in\nwords, can expel from your belief. The opinion opposed to mysticism in\nphilosophy is sometimes spoken of as _rationalism_. Rationalism insists\nthat all our beliefs ought ultimately to find for themselves articulate\ngrounds. Such grounds, for rationalism, must consist of four things: (1)\ndefinitely statable abstract principles; (2) definite facts of sensation;\n(3) definite hypotheses based on such facts; and (4) definite inferences\nlogically drawn. Vague impressions of something indefinable have no place\nin the rationalistic system, which on its positive side is surely a\nsplendid intellectual tendency, for not only are all our philosophies\nfruits of it, but physical science (amongst other good things) is its\nresult.\nNevertheless, if we look on man\u2019s whole mental life as it exists, on the\nlife of men that lies in them apart from their learning and science, and\nthat they inwardly and privately follow, we have to confess that the part\nof it of which rationalism can give an account is relatively superficial.\nIt is the part that has the _prestige_ undoubtedly, for it has the\nloquacity, it can challenge you for proofs, and chop logic, and put you\ndown with words. But it will fail to convince or convert you all the same,\nif your dumb intuitions are opposed to its conclusions. If you have\nintuitions at all, they come from a deeper level of your nature than the\nloquacious level which rationalism inhabits. Your whole subconscious life,\nyour impulses, your faiths, your needs, your divinations, have prepared\nthe premises, of which your consciousness now feels the weight of the\nresult; and something in you absolutely _knows_ that that result must be\ntruer than any logic\u2010chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may\ncontradict it. This inferiority of the rationalistic level in founding\nbelief is just as manifest when rationalism argues for religion as when it\nargues against it. That vast literature of proofs of God\u2019s existence drawn\nfrom the order of nature, which a century ago seemed so overwhelmingly\nconvincing, to\u2010day does little more than gather dust in libraries, for the\nsimple reason that our generation has ceased to believe in the kind of God\nit argued for. Whatever sort of a being God may be, we _know_ to\u2010day that\nhe is nevermore that mere external inventor of \u201ccontrivances\u201d intended to\nmake manifest his \u201cglory\u201d in which our great\u2010grandfathers took such\nsatisfaction, though just how we know this we cannot possibly make clear\nby words either to others or to ourselves. I defy any of you here fully to\naccount for your persuasion that if a God exist he must be a more cosmic\nand tragic personage than that Being.\nThe truth is that in the metaphysical and religious sphere, articulate\nreasons are cogent for us only when our inarticulate feelings of reality\nhave already been impressed in favor of the same conclusion. Then, indeed,\nour intuitions and our reason work together, and great world\u2010ruling\nsystems, like that of the Buddhist or of the Catholic philosophy, may grow\nup. Our impulsive belief is here always what sets up the original body of\ntruth, and our articulately verbalized philosophy is but its showy\ntranslation into formulas. The unreasoned and immediate assurance is the\ndeep thing in us, the reasoned argument is but a surface exhibition.\nInstinct leads, intelligence does but follow. If a person feels the\npresence of a living God after the fashion shown by my quotations, your\ncritical arguments, be they never so superior, will vainly set themselves\nto change his faith.\nPlease observe, however, that I do not yet say that it is _better_ that\nthe subconscious and non\u2010rational should thus hold primacy in the\nreligious realm. I confine myself to simply pointing out that they do so\nhold it as a matter of fact.\nSo much for our sense of the reality of the religious objects. Let me now\nsay a brief word more about the attitudes they characteristically awaken.\nWe have already agreed that they are _solemn_; and we have seen reason to\nthink that the most distinctive of them is the sort of joy which may\nresult in extreme cases from absolute self\u2010surrender. The sense of the\nkind of object to which the surrender is made has much to do with\ndetermining the precise complexion of the joy; and the whole phenomenon is\nmore complex than any simple formula allows. In the literature of the\nsubject, sadness and gladness have each been emphasized in turn. The\nancient saying that the first maker of the Gods was fear receives\nvoluminous corroboration from every age of religious history; but none the\nless does religious history show the part which joy has evermore tended to\nplay. Sometimes the joy has been primary; sometimes secondary, being the\ngladness of deliverance from the fear. This latter state of things, being\nthe more complex, is also the more complete; and as we proceed, I think we\nshall have abundant reason for refusing to leave out either the sadness or\nthe gladness, if we look at religion with the breadth of view which it\ndemands. Stated in the completest possible terms, a man\u2019s religion\ninvolves both moods of contraction and moods of expansion of his being.\nBut the quantitative mixture and order of these moods vary so much from\none age of the world, from one system of thought, and from one individual\nto another, that you may insist either on the dread and the submission, or\non the peace and the freedom as the essence of the matter, and still\nremain materially within the limits of the truth. The constitutionally\nsombre and the constitutionally sanguine onlooker are bound to emphasize\nopposite aspects of what lies before their eyes.\nThe constitutionally sombre religious person makes even of his religious\npeace a very sober thing. Danger still hovers in the air about it. Flexion\nand contraction are not wholly checked. It were sparrowlike and childish\nafter our deliverance to explode into twittering laughter and caper\u2010\ncutting, and utterly to forget the imminent hawk on bough. Lie low,\nrather, lie low; for you are in the hands of a living God. In the Book of\nJob, for example, the impotence of man and the omnipotence of God is the\nexclusive burden of its author\u2019s mind. \u201cIt is as high as heaven; what\ncanst thou do?\u2014deeper than hell; what canst thou know?\u201d There is an\nastringent relish about the truth of this conviction which some men can\nfeel, and which for them is as near an approach as can be made to the\nfeeling of religious joy.\n\u201cIn Job,\u201d says that coldly truthful writer, the author of Mark\nRutherford, \u201cGod reminds us that man is not the measure of his\ncreation. The world is immense, constructed on no plan or theory\nwhich the intellect of man can grasp. It is _transcendent_\neverywhere. This is the burden of every verse, and is the secret,\nif there be one, of the poem. Sufficient or insufficient, there is\nnothing more.... God is great, we know not his ways. He takes from\nus all we have, but yet if we possess our souls in patience, we\n_may_ pass the valley of the shadow, and come out in sunlight\nagain. We may or we may not!... What more have we to say now than\nGod said from the whirlwind over two thousand five hundred years\nago?\u201d(30)\nIf we turn to the sanguine onlooker, on the other hand, we find that\ndeliverance is felt as incomplete unless the burden be altogether overcome\nand the danger forgotten. Such onlookers give us definitions that seem to\nthe sombre minds of whom we have just been speaking to leave out all the\nsolemnity that makes religious peace so different from merely animal joys.\nIn the opinion of some writers an attitude might be called religious,\nthough no touch were left in it of sacrifice or submission, no tendency to\nflexion, no bowing of the head. Any \u201chabitual and regulated admiration,\u201d\nsays Professor J. R. Seeley,(31) \u201cis worthy to be called a religion\u201d; and\naccordingly he thinks that our Music, our Science, and our so\u2010called\n\u201cCivilization,\u201d as these things are now organized and admiringly believed\nin, form the more genuine religions of our time. Certainly the\nunhesitating and unreasoning way in which we feel that we must inflict our\ncivilization upon \u201clower\u201d races, by means of Hotchkiss guns, etc., reminds\none of nothing so much as of the early spirit of Islam spreading its\nreligion by the sword.\nIn my last lecture I quoted to you the ultra\u2010radical opinion of Mr.\nHavelock Ellis, that laughter of any sort may be considered a religious\nexercise, for it bears witness to the soul\u2019s emancipation. I quoted this\nopinion in order to deny its adequacy. But we must now settle our scores\nmore carefully with this whole optimistic way of thinking. It is far too\ncomplex to be decided off\u2010hand. I propose accordingly that we make of\nreligious optimism the theme of the next two lectures.\nLECTURES IV AND V. THE RELIGION OF HEALTHY\u2010MINDEDNESS.\nIf we were to ask the question: \u201cWhat is human life\u2019s chief concern?\u201d one\nof the answers we should receive would be: \u201cIt is happiness.\u201d How to gain,\nhow to keep, how to recover happiness, is in fact for most men at all\ntimes the secret motive of all they do, and of all they are willing to\nendure. The hedonistic school in ethics deduces the moral life wholly from\nthe experiences of happiness and unhappiness which different kinds of\nconduct bring; and, even more in the religious life than in the moral\nlife, happiness and unhappiness seem to be the poles round which the\ninterest revolves. We need not go so far as to say with the author whom I\nlately quoted that any persistent enthusiasm is, as such, religion, nor\nneed we call mere laughter a religious exercise; but we must admit that\nany persistent enjoyment may _produce_ the sort of religion which consists\nin a grateful admiration of the gift of so happy an existence; and we must\nalso acknowledge that the more complex ways of experiencing religion are\nnew manners of producing happiness, wonderful inner paths to a\nsupernatural kind of happiness, when the first gift of natural existence\nis unhappy, as it so often proves itself to be.\nWith such relations between religion and happiness, it is perhaps not\nsurprising that men come to regard the happiness which a religious belief\naffords as a proof of its truth. If a creed makes a man feel happy, he\nalmost inevitably adopts it. Such a belief ought to be true; therefore it\nis true\u2014such, rightly or wrongly, is one of the \u201cimmediate inferences\u201d of\nthe religious logic used by ordinary men.\n\u201cThe near presence of God\u2019s spirit,\u201d says a German writer,(32)\n\u201cmay be experienced in its reality\u2014indeed _only_ experienced. And\nthe mark by which the spirit\u2019s existence and nearness are made\nirrefutably clear to those who have ever had the experience is the\nutterly incomparable _feeling of happiness_ which is connected\nwith the nearness, and which is therefore not only a possible and\naltogether proper feeling for us to have here below, but is the\nbest and most indispensable proof of God\u2019s reality. No other proof\nis equally convincing, and therefore happiness is the point from\nwhich every efficacious new theology should start.\u201d\nIn the hour immediately before us, I shall invite you to consider the\nsimpler kinds of religious happiness, leaving the more complex sorts to be\ntreated on a later day.\nIn many persons, happiness is congenital and irreclaimable. \u201cCosmic\nemotion\u201d inevitably takes in them the form of enthusiasm and freedom. I\nspeak not only of those who are animally happy. I mean those who, when\nunhappiness is offered or proposed to them, positively refuse to feel it,\nas if it were something mean and wrong. We find such persons in every age,\npassionately flinging themselves upon their sense of the goodness of life,\nin spite of the hardships of their own condition, and in spite of the\nsinister theologies into which they may be born. From the outset their\nreligion is one of union with the divine. The heretics who went before the\nreformation are lavishly accused by the church writers of antinomian\npractices, just as the first Christians were accused of indulgence in\norgies by the Romans. It is probable that there never has been a century\nin which the deliberate refusal to think ill of life has not been\nidealized by a sufficient number of persons to form sects, open or secret,\nwho claimed all natural things to be permitted. Saint Augustine\u2019s maxim,\n_Dilige et quod vis fac_,\u2014if you but love [God], you may do as you\nincline,\u2014is morally one of the profoundest of observations, yet it is\npregnant, for such persons, with passports beyond the bounds of\nconventional morality. According to their characters they have been\nrefined or gross; but their belief has been at all times systematic enough\nto constitute a definite religious attitude. God was for them a giver of\nfreedom, and the sting of evil was overcome. Saint Francis and his\nimmediate disciples were, on the whole, of this company of spirits, of\nwhich there are of course infinite varieties. Rousseau in the earlier\nyears of his writing, Diderot, B. de Saint Pierre, and many of the leaders\nof the eighteenth century anti\u2010christian movement were of this optimistic\ntype. They owed their influence to a certain authoritativeness in their\nfeeling that Nature, if you will only trust her sufficiently, is\nabsolutely good.\nIt is to be hoped that we all have some friend, perhaps more often\nfeminine than masculine, and young than old, whose soul is of this sky\u2010\nblue tint, whose affinities are rather with flowers and birds and all\nenchanting innocencies than with dark human passions, who can think no ill\nof man or God, and in whom religious gladness, being in possession from\nthe outset, needs no deliverance from any antecedent burden.\n\u201cGod has two families of children on this earth,\u201d says Francis W.\nNewman,(33) \u201c_the once\u2010born_ and _the twice\u2010born_,\u201d and the once\u2010\nborn he describes as follows: \u201cThey see God, not as a strict\nJudge, not as a Glorious Potentate; but as the animating Spirit of\na beautiful harmonious world, Beneficent and Kind, Merciful as\nwell as Pure. The same characters generally have no metaphysical\ntendencies: they do not look back into themselves. Hence they are\nnot distressed by their own imperfections: yet it would be absurd\nto call them self\u2010righteous; for they hardly think of themselves\n_at all_. This childlike quality of their nature makes the opening\nof religion very happy to them: for they no more shrink from God,\nthan a child from an emperor, before whom the parent trembles: in\nfact, they have no vivid conception of _any_ of the qualities in\nwhich the severer Majesty of God consists.(34) He is to them the\nimpersonation of Kindness and Beauty. They read his character, not\nin the disordered world of man, but in romantic and harmonious\nnature. Of human sin they know perhaps little in their own hearts\nand not very much in the world; and human suffering does but melt\nthem to tenderness. Thus, when they approach God, no inward\ndisturbance ensues; and without being as yet spiritual, they have\na certain complacency and perhaps romantic sense of excitement in\ntheir simple worship.\u201d\nIn the Romish Church such characters find a more congenial soil to grow in\nthan in Protestantism, whose fashions of feeling have been set by minds of\na decidedly pessimistic order. But even in Protestantism they have been\nabundant enough; and in its recent \u201cliberal\u201d developments of Unitarianism\nand latitudinarianism generally, minds of this order have played and still\nare playing leading and constructive parts. Emerson himself is an\nadmirable example. Theodore Parker is another,\u2014here are a couple of\ncharacteristic passages from Parker\u2019s correspondence.(35)\n\u201cOrthodox scholars say: \u2018In the heathen classics you find no\nconsciousness of sin.\u2019 It is very true\u2014God be thanked for it. They\nwere conscious of wrath, of cruelty, avarice, drunkenness, lust,\nsloth, cowardice, and other actual vices, and struggled and got\nrid of the deformities, but they were not conscious of \u2018enmity\nagainst God,\u2019 and didn\u2019t sit down and whine and groan against non\u2010\nexistent evil. I have done wrong things enough in my life, and do\nthem now; I miss the mark, draw bow, and try again. But I am not\nconscious of hating God, or man, or right, or love, and I know\nthere is much \u2018health in me\u2019; and in my body, even now, there\ndwelleth many a good thing, spite of consumption and Saint Paul.\u201d\nIn another letter Parker writes: \u201cI have swum in clear sweet\nwaters all my days; and if sometimes they were a little cold, and\nthe stream ran adverse and something rough, it was never too\nstrong to be breasted and swum through. From the days of earliest\nboyhood, when I went stumbling through the grass,... up to the\ngray\u2010bearded manhood of this time, there is none but has left me\nhoney in the hive of memory that I now feed on for present\ndelight. When I recall the years ... I am filled with a sense of\nsweetness and wonder that such little things can make a mortal so\nexceedingly rich. But I must confess that the chiefest of all my\ndelights is still the religious.\u201d\nAnother good expression of the \u201conce\u2010born\u201d type of consciousness,\ndeveloping straight and natural, with no element of morbid compunction or\ncrisis, is contained in the answer of Dr. Edward Everett Hale, the eminent\nUnitarian preacher and writer, to one of Dr. Starbuck\u2019s circulars. I quote\na part of it:\u2014\n\u201cI observe, with profound regret, the religious struggles which\ncome into many biographies, as if almost essential to the\nformation of the hero. I ought to speak of these, to say that any\nman has an advantage, not to be estimated, who is born, as I was,\ninto a family where the religion is simple and rational; who is\ntrained in the theory of such a religion, so that he never knows,\nfor an hour, what these religious or irreligious struggles are. I\nalways knew God loved me, and I was always grateful to him for the\nworld he placed me in. I always liked to tell him so, and was\nalways glad to receive his suggestions to me.... I can remember\nperfectly that when I was coming to manhood, the half\u2010\nphilosophical novels of the time had a deal to say about the young\nmen and maidens who were facing the \u2018problem of life.\u2019 I had no\nidea whatever what the problem of life was. To live with all my\nmight seemed to me easy; to learn where there was so much to learn\nseemed pleasant and almost of course; to lend a hand, if one had a\nchance, natural; and if one did this, why, he enjoyed life because\nhe could not help it, and without proving to himself that he ought\nto enjoy it.... A child who is early taught that he is God\u2019s\nchild, that he may live and move and have his being in God, and\nthat he has, therefore, infinite strength at hand for the\nconquering of any difficulty, will take life more easily, and\nprobably will make more of it, than one who is told that he is\nborn the child of wrath and wholly incapable of good.\u201d(36)\nOne can but recognize in such writers as these the presence of a\ntemperament organically weighted on the side of cheer and fatally\nforbidden to linger, as those of opposite temperament linger, over the\ndarker aspects of the universe. In some individuals optimism may become\nquasi\u2010pathological. The capacity for even a transient sadness or a\nmomentary humility seems cut off from them as by a kind of congenital\nan\u00e6sthesia.(37)\nThe supreme contemporary example of such an inability to feel evil is of\ncourse Walt Whitman.\n\u201cHis favorite occupation,\u201d writes his disciple, Dr. Bucke, \u201cseemed\nto be strolling or sauntering about outdoors by himself, looking\nat the grass, the trees, the flowers, the vistas of light, the\nvarying aspects of the sky, and listening to the birds, the\ncrickets, the tree frogs, and all the hundreds of natural sounds.\nIt was evident that these things gave him a pleasure far beyond\nwhat they give to ordinary people. Until I knew the man,\u201d\ncontinues Dr. Bucke, \u201cit had not occurred to me that any one could\nderive so much absolute happiness from these things as he did. He\nwas very fond of flowers, either wild or cultivated; liked all\nsorts. I think he admired lilacs and sunflowers just as much as\nroses. Perhaps, indeed, no man who ever lived liked so many things\nand disliked so few as Walt Whitman. All natural objects seemed to\nhave a charm for him. All sights and sounds seemed to please him.\nHe appeared to like (and I believe he did like) all the men,\nwomen, and children he saw (though I never knew him to say that he\nliked any one), but each who knew him felt that he liked him or\nher, and that he liked others also. I never knew him to argue or\ndispute, and he never spoke about money. He always justified,\nsometimes playfully, sometimes quite seriously, those who spoke\nharshly of himself or his writings, and I often thought he even\ntook pleasure in the opposition of enemies. When I first knew\n[him], I used to think that he watched himself, and would not\nallow his tongue to give expression to fretfulness, antipathy,\ncomplaint, and remonstrance. It did not occur to me as possible\nthat these mental states could be absent in him. After long\nobservation, however, I satisfied myself that such absence or\nunconsciousness was entirely real. He never spoke deprecatingly of\nany nationality or class of men, or time in the world\u2019s history,\nor against any trades or occupations\u2014not even against any animals,\ninsects, or inanimate things, nor any of the laws of nature, nor\nany of the results of those laws, such as illness, deformity, and\ndeath. He never complained or grumbled either at the weather,\npain, illness, or anything else. He never swore. He could not very\nwell, since he never spoke in anger and apparently never was\nangry. He never exhibited fear, and I do not believe he ever felt\nit.\u201d(38)\nWalt Whitman owes his importance in literature to the systematic expulsion\nfrom his writings of all contractile elements. The only sentiments he\nallowed himself to express were of the expansive order; and he expressed\nthese in the first person, not as your mere monstrously conceited\nindividual might so express them, but vicariously for all men, so that a\npassionate and mystic ontological emotion suffuses his words, and ends by\npersuading the reader that men and women, life and death, and all things\nare divinely good.\nThus it has come about that many persons to\u2010day regard Walt Whitman as the\nrestorer of the eternal natural religion. He has infected them with his\nown love of comrades, with his own gladness that he and they exist.\nSocieties are actually formed for his cult; a periodical organ exists for\nits propagation, in which the lines of orthodoxy and heterodoxy are\nalready beginning to be drawn;(39) hymns are written by others in his\npeculiar prosody; and he is even explicitly compared with the founder of\nthe Christian religion, not altogether to the advantage of the latter.\nWhitman is often spoken of as a \u201cpagan.\u201d The word nowadays means sometimes\nthe mere natural animal man without a sense of sin; sometimes it means a\nGreek or Roman with his own peculiar religious consciousness. In neither\nof these senses does it fitly define this poet. He is more than your mere\nanimal man who has not tasted of the tree of good and evil. He is aware\nenough of sin for a swagger to be present in his indifference towards it,\na conscious pride in his freedom from flexions and contractions, which\nyour genuine pagan in the first sense of the word would never show.\n\u201cI could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self\u2010\ncontained,\nI stand and look at them long and long;\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition.\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\nowning things,\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\nyears ago,\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\u201d(40)\nNo natural pagan could have written these well\u2010known lines. But on the\nother hand Whitman is less than a Greek or Roman; for their consciousness,\neven in Homeric times, was full to the brim of the sad mortality of this\nsunlit world, and such a consciousness Walt Whitman resolutely refuses to\nadopt. When, for example, Achilles, about to slay Lycaon, Priam\u2019s young\nson, hears him sue for mercy, he stops to say:\u2014\n\u201cAh, friend, thou too must die: why thus lamentest thou? Patroclos\ntoo is dead, who was better far than thou.... Over me too hang\ndeath and forceful fate. There cometh morn or eve or some noonday\nwhen my life too some man shall take in battle, whether with spear\nhe smite, or arrow from the string.\u201d(41)\nThen Achilles savagely severs the poor boy\u2019s neck with his sword, heaves\nhim by the foot into the Scamander, and calls to the fishes of the river\nto eat the white fat of Lycaon. Just as here the cruelty and the sympathy\neach ring true, and do not mix or interfere with one another, so did the\nGreeks and Romans keep all their sadnesses and gladnesses unmingled and\nentire. Instinctive good they did not reckon sin; nor had they any such\ndesire to save the credit of the universe as to make them insist, as so\nmany of _us_ insist, that what immediately appears as evil must be \u201cgood\nin the making,\u201d or something equally ingenious. Good was good, and bad\njust bad, for the earlier Greeks. They neither denied the ills of\nnature,\u2014Walt Whitman\u2019s verse, \u201cWhat is called good is perfect and what is\ncalled bad is just as perfect,\u201d would have been mere silliness to\nthem,\u2014nor did they, in order to escape from those ills, invent \u201canother\nand a better world\u201d of the imagination, in which, along with the ills, the\ninnocent goods of sense would also find no place. This integrity of the\ninstinctive reactions, this freedom from all moral sophistry and strain,\ngives a pathetic dignity to ancient pagan feeling. And this quality\nWhitman\u2019s outpourings have not got. His optimism is too voluntary and\ndefiant; his gospel has a touch of bravado and an affected twist,(42) and\nthis diminishes its effect on many readers who yet are well disposed\ntowards optimism, and on the whole quite willing to admit that in\nimportant respects Whitman is of the genuine lineage of the prophets.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIf, then, we give the name of healthy\u2010mindedness to the tendency which\nlooks on all things and sees that they are good, we find that we must\ndistinguish between a more involuntary and a more voluntary or systematic\nway of being healthy\u2010minded. In its involuntary variety, healthy\u2010\nmindedness is a way of feeling happy about things immediately. In its\nsystematical variety, it is an abstract way of conceiving things as good.\nEvery abstract way of conceiving things selects some one aspect of them as\ntheir essence for the time being, and disregards the other aspects.\nSystematic healthy\u2010mindedness, conceiving good as the essential and\nuniversal aspect of being, deliberately excludes evil from its field of\nvision; and although, when thus nakedly stated, this might seem a\ndifficult feat to perform for one who is intellectually sincere with\nhimself and honest about facts, a little reflection shows that the\nsituation is too complex to lie open to so simple a criticism.\nIn the first place, happiness, like every other emotional state, has\nblindness and insensibility to opposing facts given it as its instinctive\nweapon for self\u2010protection against disturbance. When happiness is actually\nin possession, the thought of evil can no more acquire the feeling of\nreality than the thought of good can gain reality when melancholy rules.\nTo the man actively happy, from whatever cause, evil simply cannot then\nand there be believed in. He must ignore it; and to the bystander he may\nthen seem perversely to shut his eyes to it and hush it up.\nBut more than this: the hushing of it up may, in a perfectly candid and\nhonest mind, grow into a deliberate religious policy, or _parti pris_.\nMuch of what we call evil is due entirely to the way men take the\nphenomenon. It can so often be converted into a bracing and tonic good by\na simple change of the sufferer\u2019s inner attitude from one of fear to one\nof fight; its sting so often departs and turns into a relish when, after\nvainly seeking to shun it, we agree to face about and bear it cheerfully,\nthat a man is simply bound in honor, with reference to many of the facts\nthat seem at first to disconcert his peace, to adopt this way of escape.\nRefuse to admit their badness; despise their power; ignore their presence;\nturn your attention the other way; and so far as you yourself are\nconcerned at any rate, though the facts may still exist, their evil\ncharacter exists no longer. Since you make them evil or good by your own\nthoughts about them, it is the ruling of your thoughts which proves to be\nyour principal concern.\nThe deliberate adoption of an optimistic turn of mind thus makes its\nentrance into philosophy. And once in, it is hard to trace its lawful\nbounds. Not only does the human instinct for happiness, bent on self\u2010\nprotection by ignoring, keep working in its favor, but higher inner ideals\nhave weighty words to say. The attitude of unhappiness is not only\npainful, it is mean and ugly. What can be more base and unworthy than the\npining, puling, mumping mood, no matter by what outward ills it may have\nbeen engendered? What is more injurious to others? What less helpful as a\nway out of the difficulty? It but fastens and perpetuates the trouble\nwhich occasioned it, and increases the total evil of the situation. At all\ncosts, then, we ought to reduce the sway of that mood; we ought to scout\nit in ourselves and others, and never show it tolerance. But it is\nimpossible to carry on this discipline in the subjective sphere without\nzealously emphasizing the brighter and minimizing the darker aspects of\nthe objective sphere of things at the same time. And thus our resolution\nnot to indulge in misery, beginning at a comparatively small point within\nourselves, may not stop until it has brought the entire frame of reality\nunder a systematic conception optimistic enough to be congenial with its\nneeds.\nIn all this I say nothing of any mystical insight or persuasion that the\ntotal frame of things absolutely must be good. Such mystical persuasion\nplays an enormous part in the history of the religious consciousness, and\nwe must look at it later with some care. But we need not go so far at\npresent. More ordinary non\u2010mystical conditions of rapture suffice for my\nimmediate contention. All invasive moral states and passionate enthusiasms\nmake one feelingless to evil in some direction. The common penalties cease\nto deter the patriot, the usual prudences are flung by the lover to the\nwinds. When the passion is extreme, suffering may actually be gloried in,\nprovided it be for the ideal cause, death may lose its sting, the grave\nits victory. In these states, the ordinary contrast of good and ill seems\nto be swallowed up in a higher denomination, an omnipotent excitement\nwhich engulfs the evil, and which the human being welcomes as the crowning\nexperience of his life. This, he says, is truly to live, and I exult in\nthe heroic opportunity and adventure.\nThe systematic cultivation of healthy\u2010mindedness as a religious attitude\nis therefore consonant with important currents in human nature, and is\nanything but absurd. In fact, we all do cultivate it more or less, even\nwhen our professed theology should in consistency forbid it. We divert our\nattention from disease and death as much as we can; and the slaughter\u2010\nhouses and indecencies without end on which our life is founded are\nhuddled out of sight and never mentioned, so that the world we recognize\nofficially in literature and in society is a poetic fiction far handsomer\nand cleaner and better than the world that really is.(43)\nThe advance of liberalism, so\u2010called, in Christianity, during the past\nfifty years, may fairly be called a victory of healthy\u2010mindedness within\nthe church over the morbidness with which the old hell\u2010fire theology was\nmore harmoniously related. We have now whole congregations whose\npreachers, far from magnifying our consciousness of sin, seem devoted\nrather to making little of it. They ignore, or even deny, eternal\npunishment, and insist on the dignity rather than on the depravity of man.\nThey look at the continual preoccupation of the old\u2010fashioned Christian\nwith the salvation of his soul as something sickly and reprehensible\nrather than admirable; and a sanguine and \u201cmuscular\u201d attitude, which to\nour forefathers would have seemed purely heathen, has become in their eyes\nan ideal element of Christian character. I am not asking whether or not\nthey are right, I am only pointing out the change.\nThe persons to whom I refer have still retained for the most part their\nnominal connection with Christianity, in spite of their discarding of its\nmore pessimistic theological elements. But in that \u201ctheory of evolution\u201d\nwhich, gathering momentum for a century, has within the past twenty\u2010five\nyears swept so rapidly over Europe and America, we see the ground laid for\na new sort of religion of Nature, which has entirely displaced\nChristianity from the thought of a large part of our generation. The idea\nof a universal evolution lends itself to a doctrine of general meliorism\nand progress which fits the religious needs of the healthy\u2010minded so well\nthat it seems almost as if it might have been created for their use.\nAccordingly we find \u201cevolutionism\u201d interpreted thus optimistically and\nembraced as a substitute for the religion they were born in, by a\nmultitude of our contemporaries who have either been trained\nscientifically, or been fond of reading popular science, and who had\nalready begun to be inwardly dissatisfied with what seemed to them the\nharshness and irrationality of the orthodox Christian scheme. As examples\nare better than descriptions, I will quote a document received in answer\nto Professor Starbuck\u2019s circular of questions. The writer\u2019s state of mind\nmay by courtesy be called a religion, for it is his reaction on the whole\nnature of things, it is systematic and reflective, and it loyally binds\nhim to certain inner ideals. I think you will recognize in him, coarse\u2010\nmeated and incapable of wounded spirit as he is, a sufficiently familiar\ncontemporary type.\nQ. _What does Religion mean to you?_\nA. It means nothing; and it seems, so far as I can observe,\nuseless to others. I am sixty\u2010seven years of age and have resided\nin X. fifty years, and have been in business forty\u2010five,\nconsequently I have some little experience of life and men, and\nsome women too, and I find that the most religious and pious\npeople are as a rule those most lacking in uprightness and\nmorality. The men who do not go to church or have any religious\nconvictions are the best. Praying, singing of hymns, and\nsermonizing are pernicious\u2014they teach us to rely on some\nsupernatural power, when we ought to rely on ourselves. I\n_tee_totally disbelieve in a God. The God\u2010idea was begotten in\nignorance, fear, and a general lack of any knowledge of Nature. If\nI were to die now, being in a healthy condition for my age, both\nmentally and physically, I would just as lief, yes, rather, die\nwith a hearty enjoyment of music, sport, or any other rational\npastime. As a timepiece stops, we die\u2014there being no immortality\nin either case.\nQ. _What comes before your mind corresponding to the words God,\nHeaven, Angels, etc.?_\nA. Nothing whatever. I am a man without a religion. These words\nmean so much mythic bosh.\nQ. _Have you had any experiences which appeared providential?_\nA. None whatever. There is no agency of the superintending kind. A\nlittle judicious observation as well as knowledge of scientific\nlaw will convince any one of this fact.\nQ. _What things work most strongly on your emotions?_\nA. Lively songs and music; Pinafore instead of an Oratorio. I like\nScott, Burns, Byron, Longfellow, especially Shakespeare, etc.,\netc. Of songs, the Star\u2010spangled Banner, America, Marseillaise,\nand all moral and soul\u2010stirring songs, but wishy\u2010washy hymns are\nmy detestation. I greatly enjoy nature, especially fine weather,\nand until within a few years used to walk Sundays into the\ncountry, twelve miles often, with no fatigue, and bicycle forty or\nfifty. I have dropped the bicycle. I never go to church, but\nattend lectures when there are any good ones. All of my thoughts\nand cogitations have been of a healthy and cheerful kind, for\ninstead of doubts and fears I see things as they are, for I\nendeavor to adjust myself to my environment. This I regard as the\ndeepest law. Mankind is a progressive animal. I am satisfied he\nwill have made a great advance over his present status a thousand\nyears hence.\nQ. _What is your notion of sin?_\nA. It seems to me that sin is a condition, a disease, incidental\nto man\u2019s development not being yet advanced enough. Morbidness\nover it increases the disease. We should think that a million of\nyears hence equity, justice, and mental and physical good order\nwill be so fixed and organized that no one will have any idea of\nevil or sin.\nQ. _What is your temperament?_\nA. Nervous, active, wide\u2010awake, mentally and physically. Sorry\nthat Nature compels us to sleep at all.\nIf we are in search of a broken and a contrite heart, clearly we need not\nlook to this brother. His contentment with the finite incases him like a\nlobster\u2010shell and shields him from all morbid repining at his distance\nfrom the Infinite. We have in him an excellent example of the optimism\nwhich may be encouraged by popular science.\nTo my mind a current far more important and interesting religiously than\nthat which sets in from natural science towards healthy\u2010mindedness is that\nwhich has recently poured over America and seems to be gathering force\nevery day,\u2014I am ignorant what foothold it may yet have acquired in Great\nBritain,\u2014and to which, for the sake of having a brief designation, I will\ngive the title of the \u201cMind\u2010cure movement.\u201d There are various sects of\nthis \u201cNew Thought,\u201d to use another of the names by which it calls itself;\nbut their agreements are so profound that their differences may be\nneglected for my present purpose, and I will treat the movement, without\napology, as if it were a simple thing.\nIt is a deliberately optimistic scheme of life, with both a speculative\nand a practical side. In its gradual development during the last quarter\nof a century, it has taken up into itself a number of contributory\nelements, and it must now be reckoned with as a genuine religious power.\nIt has reached the stage, for example, when the demand for its literature\nis great enough for insincere stuff, mechanically produced for the market,\nto be to a certain extent supplied by publishers,\u2014a phenomenon never\nobserved, I imagine, until a religion has got well past its earliest\ninsecure beginnings.\nOne of the doctrinal sources of Mind\u2010cure is the four Gospels; another is\nEmersonianism or New England transcendentalism; another is Berkeleyan\nidealism; another is spiritism, with its messages of \u201claw\u201d and \u201cprogress\u201d\nand \u201cdevelopment\u201d; another the optimistic popular science evolutionism of\nwhich I have recently spoken; and, finally, Hinduism has contributed a\nstrain. But the most characteristic feature of the mind\u2010cure movement is\nan inspiration much more direct. The leaders in this faith have had an\nintuitive belief in the all\u2010saving power of healthy\u2010minded attitudes as\nsuch, in the conquering efficacy of courage, hope, and trust, and a\ncorrelative contempt for doubt, fear, worry, and all nervously\nprecautionary states of mind.(44) Their belief has in a general way been\ncorroborated by the practical experience of their disciples; and this\nexperience forms to\u2010day a mass imposing in amount.\nThe blind have been made to see, the halt to walk; lifelong invalids have\nhad their health restored. The moral fruits have been no less remarkable.\nThe deliberate adoption of a healthy\u2010minded attitude has proved possible\nto many who never supposed they had it in them; regeneration of character\nhas gone on on an extensive scale; and cheerfulness has been restored to\ncountless homes. The indirect influence of this has been great. The mind\u2010\ncure principles are beginning so to pervade the air that one catches their\nspirit at second\u2010hand. One hears of the \u201cGospel of Relaxation,\u201d of the\n\u201cDon\u2019t Worry Movement,\u201d of people who repeat to themselves, \u201cYouth,\nhealth, vigor!\u201d when dressing in the morning, as their motto for the day.\nComplaints of the weather are getting to be forbidden in many households;\nand more and more people are recognizing it to be bad form to speak of\ndisagreeable sensations, or to make much of the ordinary inconveniences\nand ailments of life. These general tonic effects on public opinion would\nbe good even if the more striking results were non\u2010existent. But the\nlatter abound so that we can afford to overlook the innumerable failures\nand self\u2010deceptions that are mixed in with them (for in everything human\nfailure is a matter of course), and we can also overlook the verbiage of a\ngood deal of the mind\u2010cure literature, some of which is so moonstruck with\noptimism and so vaguely expressed that an academically trained intellect\nfinds it almost impossible to read it at all.\nThe plain fact remains that the spread of the movement has been due to\npractical fruits, and the extremely practical turn of character of the\nAmerican people has never been better shown than by the fact that this,\ntheir only decidedly original contribution to the systematic philosophy of\nlife, should be so intimately knit up with concrete therapeutics. To the\nimportance of mind\u2010cure the medical and clerical professions in the United\nStates are beginning, though with much recalcitrancy and protesting, to\nopen their eyes. It is evidently bound to develop still farther, both\nspeculatively and practically, and its latest writers are far and away the\nablest of the group.(45) It matters nothing that, just as there are hosts\nof persons who cannot pray, so there are greater hosts who cannot by any\npossibility be influenced by the mind\u2010curers\u2019 ideas. For our immediate\npurpose, the important point is that so large a number should exist who\n_can_ be so influenced. They form a psychic type to be studied with\nrespect.(46)\nTo come now to a little closer quarters with their creed. The fundamental\npillar on which it rests is nothing more than the general basis of all\nreligious experience, the fact that man has a dual nature, and is\nconnected with two spheres of thought, a shallower and a profounder\nsphere, in either of which he may learn to live more habitually. The\nshallower and lower sphere is that of the fleshly sensations, instincts,\nand desires, of egotism, doubt, and the lower personal interests. But\nwhereas Christian theology has always considered _frowardness_ to be the\nessential vice of this part of human nature, the mind\u2010curers say that the\nmark of the beast in it is _fear_; and this is what gives such an entirely\nnew religious turn to their persuasion.\n\u201cFear,\u201d to quote a writer of the school, \u201chas had its uses in the\nevolutionary process, and seems to constitute the whole of\nforethought in most animals; but that it should remain any part of\nthe mental equipment of human civilized life is an absurdity. I\nfind that the fear element of forethought is not stimulating to\nthose more civilized persons to whom duty and attraction are the\nnatural motives, but is weakening and deterrent. As soon as it\nbecomes unnecessary, fear becomes a positive deterrent, and should\nbe entirely removed, as dead flesh is removed from living tissue.\nTo assist in the analysis of fear, and in the denunciation of its\nexpressions, I have coined the word _fearthought_ to stand for the\nunprofitable element of forethought, and have defined the word\n\u2018worry\u2019 as _fearthought in contradistinction to forethought_. I\nhave also defined fearthought as _the self\u2010imposed or self\u2010\npermitted suggestion of inferiority_, in order to place it where\nit really belongs, in the category of harmful, unnecessary, and\ntherefore not respectable things.\u201d(47)\nThe \u201cmisery\u2010habit,\u201d the \u201cmartyr\u2010habit,\u201d engendered by the prevalent\n\u201cfearthought,\u201d get pungent criticism from the mind\u2010cure writers:\u2014\n\u201cConsider for a moment the habits of life into which we are born.\nThere are certain social conventions or customs and alleged\nrequirements, there is a theological bias, a general view of the\nworld. There are conservative ideas in regard to our early\ntraining, our education, marriage, and occupation in life.\nFollowing close upon this, there is a long series of\nanticipations, namely, that we shall suffer certain children\u2019s\ndiseases, diseases of middle life, and of old age; the thought\nthat we shall grow old, lose our faculties, and again become\nchildlike; while crowning all is the fear of death. Then there is\na long line of particular fears and trouble\u2010bearing expectations,\nsuch, for example, as ideas associated with certain articles of\nfood, the dread of the east wind, the terrors of hot weather, the\naches and pains associated with cold weather, the fear of catching\ncold if one sits in a draught, the coming of hay\u2010fever upon the\n14th of August in the middle of the day, and so on through a long\nlist of fears, dreads, worriments, anxieties, anticipations,\nexpectations, pessimisms, morbidities, and the whole ghostly train\nof fateful shapes which our fellow\u2010men, and especially physicians,\nare ready to help us conjure up, an array worthy to rank with\nBradley\u2019s \u2018unearthly ballet of bloodless categories.\u2019\n\u201cYet this is not all. This vast array is swelled by innumerable\nvolunteers from daily life,\u2014the fear of accident, the possibility\nof calamity, the loss of property, the chance of robbery, of fire,\nor the outbreak of war. And it is not deemed sufficient to fear\nfor ourselves. When a friend is taken ill, we must forthwith fear\nthe worst and apprehend death. If one meets with sorrow ...\nsympathy means to enter into and increase the suffering.\u201d(48)\n\u201cMan,\u201d to quote another writer, \u201coften has fear stamped upon him\nbefore his entrance into the outer world; he is reared in fear;\nall his life is passed in bondage to fear of disease and death,\nand thus his whole mentality becomes cramped, limited, and\ndepressed, and his body follows its shrunken pattern and\nspecification.... Think of the millions of sensitive and\nresponsive souls among our ancestors who have been under the\ndominion of such a perpetual nightmare! Is it not surprising that\nhealth exists at all? Nothing but the boundless divine love,\nexuberance, and vitality, constantly poured in, even though\nunconsciously to us, could in some degree neutralize such an ocean\nof morbidity.\u201d(49)\nAlthough the disciples of the mind\u2010cure often use Christian terminology,\none sees from such quotations how widely their notion of the fall of man\ndiverges from that of ordinary Christians.(50)\nTheir notion of man\u2019s higher nature is hardly less divergent, being\ndecidedly pantheistic. The spiritual in man appears in the mind\u2010cure\nphilosophy as partly conscious, but chiefly subconscious; and through the\nsubconscious part of it we are already one with the Divine without any\nmiracle of grace, or abrupt creation of a new inner man. As this view is\nvariously expressed by different writers, we find in it traces of\nChristian mysticism, of transcendental idealism, of vedantism, and of the\nmodern psychology of the subliminal self. A quotation or two will put us\nat the central point of view:\u2014\n\u201cThe great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite\nlife and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and\nthrough all. This spirit of infinite life and power that is back\nof all is what I call God. I care not what term you may use, be it\nKindly Light, Providence, the Over\u2010Soul, Omnipotence, or whatever\nterm may be most convenient, so long as we are agreed in regard to\nthe great central fact itself. God then fills the universe alone,\nso that all is from Him and in Him, and there is nothing that is\noutside. He is the life of our life, our very life itself. We are\npartakers of the life of God; and though we differ from Him in\nthat we are individualized spirits, while He is the Infinite\nSpirit, including us, as well as all else beside, yet in essence\nthe life of God and the life of man are identically the same, and\nso are one. They differ not in essence or quality; they differ in\ndegree.\n\u201cThe great central fact in human life is the coming into a\nconscious vital realization of our oneness with this Infinite\nLife, and the opening of ourselves fully to this divine inflow. In\njust the degree that we come into a conscious realization of our\noneness with the Infinite Life, and open ourselves to this divine\ninflow, do we actualize in ourselves the qualities and powers of\nthe Infinite Life, do we make ourselves channels through which the\nInfinite Intelligence and Power can work. In just the degree in\nwhich you realize your oneness with the Infinite Spirit, you will\nexchange dis\u2010ease for ease, inharmony for harmony, suffering and\npain for abounding health and strength. To recognize our own\ndivinity, and our intimate relation to the Universal, is to attach\nthe belts of our machinery to the powerhouse of the Universe. One\nneed remain in hell no longer than one chooses to; we can rise to\nany heaven we ourselves choose; and when we choose so to rise, all\nthe higher powers of the Universe combine to help us\nheavenward.\u201d(51)\nLet me now pass from these abstracter statements to some more concrete\naccounts of experience with the mind\u2010cure religion. I have many answers\nfrom correspondents\u2014the only difficulty is to choose. The first two whom I\nshall quote are my personal friends. One of them, a woman, writing as\nfollows, expresses well the feeling of continuity with the Infinite Power,\nby which all mind\u2010cure disciples are inspired.\n\u201cThe first underlying cause of all sickness, weakness, or\ndepression is the _human sense of separateness_ from that Divine\nEnergy which we call God. The soul which can feel and affirm in\nserene but jubilant confidence, as did the Nazarene: \u2018I and my\nFather are one,\u2019 has no further need of healer, or of healing.\nThis is the whole truth in a nutshell, and other foundation for\nwholeness can no man lay than this fact of impregnable divine\nunion. Disease can no longer attack one whose feet are planted on\nthis rock, who feels hourly, momently, the influx of the Deific\nBreath. If one with Omnipotence, how can weariness enter the\nconsciousness, how illness assail that indomitable spark?\n\u201cThis possibility of annulling forever the law of fatigue has been\nabundantly proven in my own case; for my earlier life bears a\nrecord of many, many years of bedridden invalidism, with spine and\nlower limbs paralyzed. My thoughts were no more impure than they\nare to\u2010day, although my belief in the necessity of illness was\ndense and unenlightened; but since my resurrection in the flesh, I\nhave worked as a healer unceasingly for fourteen years without a\nvacation, and can truthfully assert that I have never known a\nmoment of fatigue or pain, although coming in touch constantly\nwith excessive weakness, illness, and disease of all kinds. For\nhow can a conscious part of Deity be sick?\u2014since \u2018Greater is he\nthat is _with_ us than all that can strive against us.\u2019 \u201d\nMy second correspondent, also a woman, sends me the following statement:\u2014\n\u201cLife seemed difficult to me at one time. I was always breaking\ndown, and had several attacks of what is called nervous\nprostration, with terrible insomnia, being on the verge of\ninsanity; besides having many other troubles, especially of the\ndigestive organs. I had been sent away from home in charge of\ndoctors, had taken all the narcotics, stopped all work, been fed\nup, and in fact knew all the doctors within reach. But I never\nrecovered permanently till this New Thought took possession of me.\n\u201cI think that the one thing which impressed me most was learning\nthe fact that we must be in absolutely constant relation or mental\ntouch (this word is to me very expressive) with that essence of\nlife which permeates all and which we call God. This is almost\nunrecognizable unless we live it into ourselves _actually_, that\nis, by a constant turning to the very innermost, deepest\nconsciousness of our real selves or of God in us, for illumination\nfrom within, just as we turn to the sun for light, warmth, and\ninvigoration without. When you do this consciously, realizing that\nto turn inward to the light within you is to live in the presence\nof God or your divine self, you soon discover the unreality of the\nobjects to which you have hitherto been turning and which have\nengrossed you without.\n\u201cI have come to disregard the meaning of this attitude for bodily\nhealth _as such_, because that comes of itself, as an incidental\nresult, and cannot be found by any special mental act or desire to\nhave it, beyond that general attitude of mind I have referred to\nabove. That which we usually make the object of life, those outer\nthings we are all so wildly seeking, which we so often live and\ndie for, but which then do not give us peace and happiness, they\nshould all come of themselves as accessory, and as the mere\noutcome or natural result of a far higher life sunk deep in the\nbosom of the spirit. This life is the real seeking of the kingdom\nof God, the desire for his supremacy in our hearts, so that all\nelse comes as that which shall be \u2018added unto you\u2019\u2014as quite\nincidental and as a surprise to us, perhaps; and yet it is the\nproof of the reality of the perfect poise in the very centre of\nour being.\n\u201cWhen I say that we commonly make the object of our life that\nwhich we should not work for primarily, I mean many things which\nthe world considers praiseworthy and excellent, such as success in\nbusiness, fame as author or artist, physician or lawyer, or renown\nin philanthropic undertakings. Such things should be results, not\nobjects. I would also include pleasures of many kinds which seem\nharmless and good at the time, and are pursued because many accept\nthem\u2014I mean conventionalities, sociabilities, and fashions in\ntheir various development, these being mostly approved by the\nmasses, although they may be unreal, and even unhealthy\nsuperfluities.\u201d\nHere is another case, more concrete, also that of a woman. I read you\nthese cases without comment,\u2014they express so many varieties of the state\nof mind we are studying.\n\u201cI had been a sufferer from my childhood till my fortieth year.\n[Details of ill\u2010health are given which I omit.] I had been in\nVermont several months hoping for good from the change of air, but\nsteadily growing weaker, when one day during the latter part of\nOctober, while resting in the afternoon, I suddenly heard as it\nwere these words: \u2018You will be healed and do a work you never\ndreamed of.\u2019 These words were impressed upon my mind with such\npower I said at once that only God could have put them there. I\nbelieved them in spite of myself and of my suffering and weakness,\nwhich continued until Christmas, when I returned to Boston. Within\ntwo days a young friend offered to take me to a mental healer\n(this was January 7, 1881). The healer said: \u2018There is nothing but\nMind; we are expressions of the One Mind; body is only a mortal\nbelief; as a man thinketh so is he.\u2019 I could not accept all she\nsaid, but I translated all that was there for _me_ in this way:\n\u2018There is nothing but God; I am created by Him, and am absolutely\ndependent upon Him; mind is given me to use; and by just so much\nof it as I will put upon the thought of right action in body I\nshall be lifted out of bondage to my ignorance and fear and past\nexperience.\u2019 That day I commenced accordingly to take a little of\nevery food provided for the family, constantly saying to myself:\n\u2018The Power that created the stomach must take care of what I have\neaten.\u2019 By holding these suggestions through the evening I went to\nbed and fell asleep, saying: \u2018I am soul, spirit, just one with\nGod\u2019s Thought of me,\u2019 and slept all night without waking, for the\nfirst time in several years [the distress\u2010turns had usually\nrecurred about two o\u2019clock in the night]. I felt the next day like\nan escaped prisoner, and believed I had found the secret that\nwould in time give me perfect health. Within ten days I was able\nto eat anything provided for others, and after two weeks I began\nto have my own positive mental suggestions of Truth, which were to\nme like stepping\u2010stones. I will note a few of them; they came\nabout two weeks apart.\n\u201c1st. I am Soul, therefore it is well with me.\n\u201c2d. I am Soul, therefore I _am_ well.\n\u201c3d. A sort of inner vision of myself as a four\u2010footed beast with\na protuberance on every part of my body where I had suffering,\nwith my own face, begging me to acknowledge it as myself. I\nresolutely fixed my attention on being well, and refused to even\nlook at my old self in this form.\n\u201c4th. Again the vision of the beast far in the background, with\nfaint voice. Again refusal to acknowledge.\n\u201c5th. Once more the vision, but only of my eyes with the longing\nlook; and again the refusal. Then came the conviction, the inner\nconsciousness, that I was perfectly well and always had been, for\nI was Soul, an expression of God\u2019s Perfect Thought. That was to me\nthe perfect and completed separation between what I was and what I\nappeared to be. I succeeded in never losing sight after this of my\nreal being, by constantly affirming this truth, and by degrees\n(though it took me two years of hard work to get there) _I\nexpressed health continuously throughout my whole body_.\n\u201cIn my subsequent nineteen years\u2019 experience I have never known\nthis Truth to fail when I applied it, though in my ignorance I\nhave often failed to apply it, but through my failures I have\nlearned the simplicity and trustfulness of the little child.\u201d\nBut I fear that I risk tiring you by so many examples, and I must lead you\nback to philosophic generalities again. You see already by such records of\nexperience how impossible it is not to class mind\u2010cure as primarily a\nreligious movement. Its doctrine of the oneness of our life with God\u2019s\nlife is in fact quite indistinguishable from an interpretation of Christ\u2019s\nmessage which in these very Gifford lectures has been defended by some of\nyour very ablest Scottish religious philosophers.(52)\nBut philosophers usually profess to give a quasi\u2010logical explanation of\nthe existence of evil, whereas of the general fact of evil in the world,\nthe existence of the selfish, suffering, timorous finite consciousness,\nthe mind\u2010curers, so far as I am acquainted with them, profess to give no\nspeculative explanation. Evil is empirically there for them as it is for\neverybody, but the practical point of view predominates, and it would ill\nagree with the spirit of their system to spend time in worrying over it as\na \u201cmystery\u201d or \u201cproblem,\u201d or in \u201claying to heart\u201d the lesson of its\nexperience, after the manner of the Evangelicals. Don\u2019t reason about it,\nas Dante says, but give a glance and pass beyond! It is Avidhya,\nignorance! something merely to be outgrown and left behind, transcended\nand forgotten. Christian Science so\u2010called, the sect of Mrs. Eddy, is the\nmost radical branch of mind\u2010cure in its dealings with evil. For it evil is\nsimply a _lie_, and any one who mentions it is a liar. The optimistic\nideal of duty forbids us to pay it the compliment even of explicit\nattention. Of course, as our next lectures will show us, this is a bad\nspeculative omission, but it is intimately linked with the practical\nmerits of the system we are examining. Why regret a philosophy of evil, a\nmind\u2010curer would ask us, if I can put you in possession of a life of good?\nAfter all, it is the life that tells; and mind\u2010cure has developed a living\nsystem of mental hygiene which may well claim to have thrown all previous\nliterature of the _Di\u00e4tetik der Seele_ into the shade. This system is\nwholly and exclusively compacted of optimism: \u201cPessimism leads to\nweakness. Optimism leads to power.\u201d \u201cThoughts are things,\u201d as one of the\nmost vigorous mind\u2010cure writers prints in bold type at the bottom of each\nof his pages; and if your thoughts are of health, youth, vigor, and\nsuccess, before you know it these things will also be your outward\nportion. No one can fail of the regenerative influence of optimistic\nthinking, pertinaciously pursued. Every man owns indefeasibly this inlet\nto the divine. Fear, on the contrary, and all the contracted and egoistic\nmodes of thought, are inlets to destruction. Most mind\u2010curers here bring\nin a doctrine that thoughts are \u201cforces,\u201d and that, by virtue of a law\nthat like attracts like, one man\u2019s thoughts draw to themselves as allies\nall the thoughts of the same character that exist the world over. Thus one\ngets, by one\u2019s thinking, reinforcements from elsewhere for the realization\nof one\u2019s desires; and the great point in the conduct of life is to get the\nheavenly forces on one\u2019s side by opening one\u2019s own mind to their influx.\nOn the whole, one is struck by a psychological similarity between the\nmind\u2010cure movement and the Lutheran and Wesleyan movements. To the\nbeliever in moralism and works, with his anxious query, \u201cWhat shall I do\nto be saved?\u201d Luther and Wesley replied: \u201cYou are saved now, if you would\nbut believe it.\u201d And the mind\u2010curers come with precisely similar words of\nemancipation. They speak, it is true, to persons for whom the conception\nof salvation has lost its ancient theological meaning, but who labor\nnevertheless with the same eternal human difficulty. _Things are wrong\nwith them_; and \u201cWhat shall I do to be clear, right, sound, whole, well?\u201d\nis the form of their question. And the answer is: \u201cYou _are_ well, sound,\nand clear already, if you did but know it.\u201d \u201cThe whole matter may be\nsummed up in one sentence,\u201d says one of the authors whom I have already\nquoted, \u201c_God is well, and so are you_. You must awaken to the knowledge\nof your real being.\u201d\nThe adequacy of their message to the mental needs of a large fraction of\nmankind is what gave force to those earlier gospels. Exactly the same\nadequacy holds in the case of the mind\u2010cure message, foolish as it may\nsound upon its surface; and seeing its rapid growth in influence, and its\ntherapeutic triumphs, one is tempted to ask whether it may not be destined\n(probably by very reason of the crudity and extravagance of many of its\nmanifestations(53)) to play a part almost as great in the evolution of the\npopular religion of the future as did those earlier movements in their\nday.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut I here fear that I may begin to \u201cjar upon the nerves\u201d of some of the\nmembers of this academic audience. Such contemporary vagaries, you may\nthink, should hardly take so large a place in dignified Gifford lectures.\nI can only beseech you to have patience. The whole outcome of these\nlectures will, I imagine, be the emphasizing to your mind of the enormous\ndiversities which the spiritual lives of different men exhibit. Their\nwants, their susceptibilities, and their capacities all vary and must be\nclassed under different heads. The result is that we have really different\ntypes of religious experience; and, seeking in these lectures closer\nacquaintance with the healthy\u2010minded type, we must take it where we find\nit in most radical form. The psychology of individual types of character\nhas hardly begun even to be sketched as yet\u2014our lectures may possibly\nserve as a crumb\u2010like contribution to the structure. The first thing to\nbear in mind (especially if we ourselves belong to the clerico\u2010academic\u2010\nscientific type, the officially and conventionally \u201ccorrect\u201d type, \u201cthe\ndeadly respectable\u201d type, for which to ignore others is a besetting\ntemptation) is that nothing can be more stupid than to bar out phenomena\nfrom our notice, merely because we are incapable of taking part in\nanything like them ourselves.\nNow the history of Lutheran salvation by faith, of methodistic\nconversions, and of what I call the mind\u2010cure movement seems to prove the\nexistence of numerous persons in whom\u2014at any rate at a certain stage in\ntheir development\u2014a change of character for the better, so far from being\nfacilitated by the rules laid down by official moralists, will take place\nall the more successfully if those rules be exactly reversed. Official\nmoralists advise us never to relax our strenuousness. \u201cBe vigilant, day\nand night,\u201d they adjure us; \u201chold your passive tendencies in check; shrink\nfrom no effort; keep your will like a bow always bent.\u201d But the persons I\nspeak of find that all this conscious effort leads to nothing but failure\nand vexation in their hands, and only makes them two\u2010fold more the\nchildren of hell they were before. The tense and voluntary attitude\nbecomes in them an impossible fever and torment. Their machinery refuses\nto run at all when the bearings are made so hot and the belts so tight.\nUnder these circumstances the way to success, as vouched for by\ninnumerable authentic personal narrations, is by an anti\u2010moralistic\nmethod, by the \u201csurrender\u201d of which I spoke in my second lecture.\nPassivity, not activity; relaxation, not intentness, should be now the\nrule. Give up the feeling of responsibility, let go your hold, resign the\ncare of your destiny to higher powers, be genuinely indifferent as to what\nbecomes of it all, and you will find not only that you gain a perfect\ninward relief, but often also, in addition, the particular goods you\nsincerely thought you were renouncing. This is the salvation through self\u2010\ndespair, the dying to be truly born, of Lutheran theology, the passage\ninto _nothing_ of which Jacob Behmen writes. To get to it, a critical\npoint must usually be passed, a corner turned within one. Something must\ngive way, a native hardness must break down and liquefy; and this event\n(as we shall abundantly see hereafter) is frequently sudden and automatic,\nand leaves on the Subject an impression that he has been wrought on by an\nexternal power.\nWhatever its ultimate significance may prove to be, this is certainly one\nfundamental form of human experience. Some say that the capacity or\nincapacity for it is what divides the religious from the merely moralistic\ncharacter. With those who undergo it in its fullness, no criticism avails\nto cast doubt on its reality. They _know_; for they have actually _felt_\nthe higher powers, in giving up the tension of their personal will.\nA story which revivalist preachers often tell is that of a man who found\nhimself at night slipping down the side of a precipice. At last he caught\na branch which stopped his fall, and remained clinging to it in misery for\nhours. But finally his fingers had to loose their hold, and with a\ndespairing farewell to life, he let himself drop. He fell just six inches.\nIf he had given up the struggle earlier, his agony would have been spared.\nAs the mother earth received him, so, the preachers tell us, will the\neverlasting arms receive _us_ if we confide absolutely in them, and give\nup the hereditary habit of relying on our personal strength, with its\nprecautions that cannot shelter and safeguards that never save.\nThe mind\u2010curers have given the widest scope to this sort of experience.\nThey have demonstrated that a form of regeneration by relaxing, by letting\ngo, psychologically indistinguishable from the Lutheran justification by\nfaith and the Wesleyan acceptance of free grace, is within the reach of\npersons who have no conviction of sin and care nothing for the Lutheran\ntheology. It is but giving your little private convulsive self a rest, and\nfinding that a greater Self is there. The results, slow or sudden, or\ngreat or small, of the combined optimism and expectancy, the regenerative\nphenomena which ensue on the abandonment of effort, remain firm facts of\nhuman nature, no matter whether we adopt a theistic, a pantheistic\u2010\nidealistic, or a medical\u2010materialistic view of their ultimate causal\nexplanation.(54)\nWhen we take up the phenomena of revivalistic conversion, we shall learn\nsomething more about all this. Meanwhile I will say a brief word about the\nmind\u2010curer\u2019s _methods_.\nThey are of course largely suggestive. The suggestive influence of\nenvironment plays an enormous part in all spiritual education. But the\nword \u201csuggestion,\u201d having acquired official status, is unfortunately\nalready beginning to play in many quarters the part of a wet blanket upon\ninvestigation, being used to fend off all inquiry into the varying\nsusceptibilities of individual cases. \u201cSuggestion\u201d is only another name\nfor the power of ideas, _so far as they prove efficacious over belief and\nconduct_. Ideas efficacious over some people prove inefficacious over\nothers. Ideas efficacious at some times and in some human surroundings are\nnot so at other times and elsewhere. The ideas of Christian churches are\nnot efficacious in the therapeutic direction to\u2010day, whatever they may\nhave been in earlier centuries; and when the whole question is as to why\nthe salt has lost its savor here or gained it there, the mere blank waving\nof the word \u201csuggestion\u201d as if it were a banner gives no light. Dr.\nGoddard, whose candid psychological essay on Faith Cures ascribes them to\nnothing but ordinary suggestion, concludes by saying that \u201cReligion [and\nby this he seems to mean our popular Christianity] has in it all there is\nin mental therapeutics, and has it in its best form. Living up to [our\nreligious] ideas will do anything for us that can be done.\u201d And this in\nspite of the actual fact that the popular Christianity does absolutely\n_nothing_, or did nothing until mind\u2010cure came to the rescue.(55)\nAn idea, to be suggestive, must come to the individual with the force of a\nrevelation. The mind\u2010cure with its gospel of healthy\u2010mindedness has come\nas a revelation to many whose hearts the church Christianity had left\nhardened. It has let loose their springs of higher life. In what can the\noriginality of any religious movement consist, save in finding a channel,\nuntil then sealed up, through which those springs may be set free in some\ngroup of human beings?\nThe force of personal faith, enthusiasm, and example, and above all the\nforce of novelty, are always the prime suggestive agency in this kind of\nsuccess. If mind\u2010cure should ever become official, respectable, and\nintrenched, these elements of suggestive efficacy will be lost. In its\nacuter stages every religion must be a homeless Arab of the desert. The\nchurch knows this well enough, with its everlasting inner struggle of the\nacute religion of the few against the chronic religion of the many,\nindurated into an obstructiveness worse than that which irreligion opposes\nto the movings of the Spirit. \u201cWe may pray,\u201d says Jonathan Edwards,\n\u201cconcerning all those saints that are not lively Christians, that they may\neither be enlivened, or taken away; if that be true that is often said by\nsome at this day, that these cold dead saints do more hurt than natural\nmen, and lead more souls to hell, and that it would be well for mankind if\nthey were all dead.\u201d(56)\nThe next condition of success is the apparent existence, in large numbers,\nof minds who unite healthy\u2010mindedness with readiness for regeneration by\nletting go. Protestantism has been too pessimistic as regards the natural\nman, Catholicism has been too legalistic and moralistic, for either the\none or the other to appeal in any generous way to the type of character\nformed of this peculiar mingling of elements. However few of us here\npresent may belong to such a type, it is now evident that it forms a\nspecific moral combination, well represented in the world.\nFinally, mind\u2010cure has made what in our protestant countries is an\nunprecedentedly great use of the subconscious life. To their reasoned\nadvice and dogmatic assertion, its founders have added systematic exercise\nin passive relaxation, concentration, and meditation, and have even\ninvoked something like hypnotic practice. I quote some passages at\nrandom:\u2014\n\u201cThe value, the potency of ideals is the great practical truth on\nwhich the New Thought most strongly insists,\u2014the development\nnamely from within outward, from small to great.(57) Consequently\none\u2019s thought should be centred on the ideal outcome, even though\nthis trust be literally like a step in the dark.(58) To attain the\nability thus effectively to direct the mind, the New Thought\nadvises the practice of concentration, or in other words, the\nattainment of self\u2010control. One is to learn to marshal the\ntendencies of the mind, so that they may be held together as a\nunit by the chosen ideal. To this end, one should set apart times\nfor silent meditation, by one\u2019s self, preferably in a room where\nthe surroundings are favorable to spiritual thought. In New\nThought terms, this is called \u2018entering the silence.\u2019 \u201d(59)\n\u201cThe time will come when in the busy office or on the noisy street\nyou can enter into the silence by simply drawing the mantle of\nyour own thoughts about you and realizing that there and\neverywhere the Spirit of Infinite Life, Love, Wisdom, Peace,\nPower, and Plenty is guiding, keeping, protecting, leading you.\nThis is the spirit of continual prayer.(60) One of the most\nintuitive men we ever met had a desk at a city office where\nseveral other gentlemen were doing business constantly, and often\ntalking loudly. Entirely undisturbed by the many various sounds\nabout him, this self\u2010centred faithful man would, in any moment of\nperplexity, draw the curtains of privacy so completely about him\nthat he would be as fully inclosed in his own psychic aura, and\nthereby as effectually removed from all distractions, as though he\nwere alone in some primeval wood. Taking his difficulty with him\ninto the mystic silence in the form of a direct question, to which\nhe expected a certain answer, he would remain utterly passive\nuntil the reply came, and never once through many years\u2019\nexperience did he find himself disappointed or misled.\u201d(61)\nWherein, I should like to know, does this _intrinsically_ differ from the\npractice of \u201crecollection\u201d which plays so great a part in Catholic\ndiscipline? Otherwise called the practice of the presence of God (and so\nknown among ourselves, as for instance in Jeremy Taylor), it is thus\ndefined by the eminent teacher Alvarez de Paz in his work on\nContemplation.\n\u201cIt is the recollection of God, the thought of God, which in all\nplaces and circumstances makes us see him present, lets us commune\nrespectfully and lovingly with him, and fills us with desire and\naffection for him.... Would you escape from every ill? Never lose\nthis recollection of God, neither in prosperity nor in adversity,\nnor on any occasion whichsoever it be. Invoke not, to excuse\nyourself from this duty, either the difficulty or the importance\nof your business, for you can always remember that God sees you,\nthat you are under his eye. If a thousand times an hour you forget\nhim, reanimate a thousand times the recollection. If you cannot\npractice this exercise continuously, at least make yourself as\nfamiliar with it as possible; and, like unto those who in a\nrigorous winter draw near the fire as often as they can, go as\noften as you can to that ardent fire which will warm your\nsoul.\u201d(62)\nAll the external associations of the Catholic discipline are of course\nunlike anything in mind\u2010cure thought, but the purely spiritual part of the\nexercise is identical in both communions, and in both communions those who\nurge it write with authority, for they have evidently experienced in their\nown persons that whereof they tell. Compare again some mind\u2010cure\nutterances:\u2014\n\u201cHigh, healthful, pure thinking can be encouraged, promoted, and\nstrengthened. Its current can be turned upon grand ideals until it\nforms a habit and wears a channel. By means of such discipline the\nmental horizon can be flooded with the sunshine of beauty,\nwholeness, and harmony. To inaugurate pure and lofty thinking may\nat first seem difficult, even almost mechanical, but perseverance\nwill at length render it easy, then pleasant, and finally\ndelightful.\n\u201cThe soul\u2019s real world is that which it has built of its thoughts,\nmental states, and imaginations. If we _will_, we can turn our\nbacks upon the lower and sensuous plane, and lift ourselves into\nthe realm of the spiritual and Real, and there gain a residence.\nThe assumption of states of expectancy and receptivity will\nattract spiritual sunshine, and it will flow in as naturally as\nair inclines to a vacuum.... Whenever the thought is not occupied\nwith one\u2019s daily duty or profession, it should be sent aloft into\nthe spiritual atmosphere. There are quiet leisure moments by day,\nand wakeful hours at night, when this wholesome and delightful\nexercise may be engaged in to great advantage. If one who has\nnever made any systematic effort to lift and control the thought\u2010\nforces will, for a single month, earnestly pursue the course here\nsuggested, he will be surprised and delighted at the result, and\nnothing will induce him to go back to careless, aimless, and\nsuperficial thinking. At such favorable seasons the outside world,\nwith all its current of daily events, is barred out, and one goes\ninto the silent sanctuary of the inner temple of soul to commune\nand aspire. The spiritual hearing becomes delicately sensitive, so\nthat the \u2018still, small voice\u2019 is audible, the tumultuous waves of\nexternal sense are hushed, and there is a great calm. The ego\ngradually becomes conscious that it is face to face with the\nDivine Presence; that mighty, healing, loving, Fatherly life which\nis nearer to us than we are to ourselves. There is soul\u2010contact\nwith the Parent\u2010Soul, and an influx of life, love, virtue, health,\nand happiness from the Inexhaustible Fountain.\u201d(63)\nWhen we reach the subject of mysticism, you will undergo so deep an\nimmersion into these exalted states of consciousness as to be wet all\nover, if I may so express myself; and the cold shiver of doubt with which\nthis little sprinkling may affect you will have long since passed\naway\u2014doubt, I mean, as to whether all such writing be not mere abstract\ntalk and rhetoric set down _pour encourager les autres_. You will then be\nconvinced, I trust, that these states of consciousness of \u201cunion\u201d form a\nperfectly definite class of experiences, of which the soul may\noccasionally partake, and which certain persons may live by in a deeper\nsense than they live by anything else with which they have acquaintance.\nThis brings me to a general philosophical reflection with which I should\nlike to pass from the subject of healthy\u2010mindedness, and close a topic\nwhich I fear is already only too long drawn out. It concerns the relation\nof all this systematized healthy\u2010mindedness and mind\u2010cure religion to\nscientific method and the scientific life.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn a later lecture I shall have to treat explicitly of the relation of\nreligion to science on the one hand, and to primeval savage thought on the\nother. There are plenty of persons to\u2010day\u2014\u201cscientists\u201d or \u201cpositivists,\u201d\nthey are fond of calling themselves\u2014who will tell you that religious\nthought is a mere survival, an atavistic reversion to a type of\nconsciousness which humanity in its more enlightened examples has long\nsince left behind and outgrown. If you ask them to explain themselves more\nfully, they will probably say that for primitive thought everything is\nconceived of under the form of personality. The savage thinks that things\noperate by personal forces, and for the sake of individual ends. For him,\neven external nature obeys individual needs and claims, just as if these\nwere so many elementary powers. Now science, on the other hand, these\npositivists say, has proved that personality, so far from being an\nelementary force in nature, is but a passive resultant of the really\nelementary forces, physical, chemical, physiological, and psycho\u2010physical,\nwhich are all impersonal and general in character. Nothing individual\naccomplishes anything in the universe save in so far as it obeys and\nexemplifies some universal law. Should you then inquire of them by what\nmeans science has thus supplanted primitive thought, and discredited its\npersonal way of looking at things, they would undoubtedly say it has been\nby the strict use of the method of experimental verification. Follow out\nscience\u2019s conceptions practically, they will say, the conceptions that\nignore personality altogether, and you will always be corroborated. The\nworld is so made that all your expectations will be experientially\nverified so long, and only so long, as you keep the terms from which you\ninfer them impersonal and universal.\nBut here we have mind\u2010cure, with her diametrically opposite philosophy,\nsetting up an exactly identical claim. Live as if I were true, she says,\nand every day will practically prove you right. That the controlling\nenergies of nature are personal, that your own personal thoughts are\nforces, that the powers of the universe will directly respond to your\nindividual appeals and needs, are propositions which your whole bodily and\nmental experience will verify. And that experience does largely verify\nthese primeval religious ideas is proved by the fact that the mind\u2010cure\nmovement spreads as it does, not by proclamation and assertion simply, but\nby palpable experiential results. Here, in the very heyday of science\u2019s\nauthority, it carries on an aggressive warfare against the scientific\nphilosophy, and succeeds by using science\u2019s own peculiar methods and\nweapons. Believing that a higher power will take care of us in certain\nways better than we can take care of ourselves, if we only genuinely throw\nourselves upon it and consent to use it, it finds the belief, not only not\nimpugned, but corroborated by its observation.\nHow conversions are thus made, and converts confirmed, is evident enough\nfrom the narratives which I have quoted. I will quote yet another couple\nof shorter ones to give the matter a perfectly concrete turn. Here is\none:\u2014\n\u201cOne of my first experiences in applying my teaching was two\nmonths after I first saw the healer. I fell, spraining my right\nankle, which I had done once four years before, having then had to\nuse a crutch and elastic anklet for some months, and carefully\nguarding it ever since. As soon as I was on my feet I made the\npositive suggestion (and felt it through all my being): \u2018There is\nnothing but God, all life comes from him perfectly. I cannot be\nsprained or hurt, I will let him take care of it.\u2019 Well, I never\nhad a sensation in it, and I walked two miles that day.\u201d\nThe next case not only illustrates experiment and verification, but also\nthe element of passivity and surrender of which awhile ago I made such\naccount.\n\u201cI went into town to do some shopping one morning, and I had not\nbeen gone long before I began to feel ill. The ill feeling\nincreased rapidly, until I had pains in all my bones, nausea and\nfaintness, headache, all the symptoms in short that precede an\nattack of influenza. I thought that I was going to have the\ngrippe, epidemic then in Boston, or something worse. The mind\u2010cure\nteachings that I had been listening to all the winter thereupon\ncame into my mind, and I thought that here was an opportunity to\ntest myself. On my way home I met a friend, and I refrained with\nsome effort from telling her how I felt. That was the first step\ngained. I went to bed immediately, and my husband wished to send\nfor the doctor. But I told him that I would rather wait until\nmorning and see how I felt. Then followed one of the most\nbeautiful experiences of my life.\n\u201cI cannot express it in any other way than to say that I did \u2018lie\ndown in the stream of life and let it flow over me.\u2019 I gave up all\nfear of any impending disease; I was perfectly willing and\nobedient. There was no intellectual effort, or train of thought.\nMy dominant idea was: \u2018Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto\nme even as thou wilt,\u2019 and a perfect confidence that all would be\nwell, that all _was_ well. The creative life was flowing into me\nevery instant, and I felt myself allied with the Infinite, in\nharmony, and full of the peace that passeth understanding. There\nwas no place in my mind for a jarring body. I had no consciousness\nof time or space or persons; but only of love and happiness and\nfaith.\n\u201cI do not know how long this state lasted, nor when I fell asleep;\nbut when I woke up in the morning, _I was well_.\u201d\nThese are exceedingly trivial instances,(64) but in them, if we have\nanything at all, we have the method of experiment and verification. For\nthe point I am driving at now, it makes no difference whether you consider\nthe patients to be deluded victims of their imagination or not. That they\nseemed to _themselves_ to have been cured by the experiments tried was\nenough to make them converts to the system. And although it is evident\nthat one must be of a certain mental mould to get such results (for not\nevery one can get thus cured to his own satisfaction any more than every\none can be cured by the first regular practitioner whom he calls in), yet\nit would surely be pedantic and over\u2010scrupulous for those who _can_ get\ntheir savage and primitive philosophy of mental healing verified in such\nexperimental ways as this, to give them up at word of command for more\nscientific therapeutics. What are we to think of all this? Has science\nmade too wide a claim?\nI believe that the claims of the sectarian scientist are, to say the\nleast, premature. The experiences which we have been studying during this\nhour (and a great many other kinds of religious experiences are like them)\nplainly show the universe to be a more many\u2010sided affair than any sect,\neven the scientific sect, allows for. What, in the end, are all our\nverifications but experiences that agree with more or less isolated\nsystems of ideas (conceptual systems) that our minds have framed? But why\nin the name of common sense need we assume that only one such system of\nideas can be true? The obvious outcome of our total experience is that the\nworld can be handled according to many systems of ideas, and is so handled\nby different men, and will each time give some characteristic kind of\nprofit, for which he cares, to the handler, while at the same time some\nother kind of profit has to be omitted or postponed. Science gives to all\nof us telegraphy, electric lighting, and diagnosis, and succeeds in\npreventing and curing a certain amount of disease. Religion in the shape\nof mind\u2010cure gives to some of us serenity, moral poise, and happiness, and\nprevents certain forms of disease as well as science does, or even better\nin a certain class of persons. Evidently, then, the science and the\nreligion are both of them genuine keys for unlocking the world\u2019s treasure\u2010\nhouse to him who can use either of them practically. Just as evidently\nneither is exhaustive or exclusive of the other\u2019s simultaneous use. And\nwhy, after all, may not the world be so complex as to consist of many\ninterpenetrating spheres of reality, which we can thus approach in\nalternation by using different conceptions and assuming different\nattitudes, just as mathematicians handle the same numerical and spatial\nfacts by geometry, by analytical geometry, by algebra, by the calculus, or\nby quaternions, and each time come out right? On this view religion and\nscience, each verified in its own way from hour to hour and from life to\nlife, would be co\u2010eternal. Primitive thought, with its belief in\nindividualized personal forces, seems at any rate as far as ever from\nbeing driven by science from the field to\u2010day. Numbers of educated people\nstill find it the directest experimental channel by which to carry on\ntheir intercourse with reality.(65)\nThe case of mind\u2010cure lay so ready to my hand that I could not resist the\ntemptation of using it to bring these last truths home to your attention,\nbut I must content myself to\u2010day with this very brief indication. In a\nlater lecture the relations of religion both to science and to primitive\nthought will have to receive much more explicit attention.\nAppendix\n(See note to p. 121.)\nCASE I. \u201cMy own experience is this: I had long been ill, and one\nof the first results of my illness, a dozen years before, had been\na diplopia which deprived me of the use of my eyes for reading and\nwriting almost entirely, while a later one had been to shut me out\nfrom exercise of any kind under penalty of immediate and great\nexhaustion. I had been under the care of doctors of the highest\nstanding both in Europe and America, men in whose power to help me\nI had had great faith, with no or ill result. Then, at a time when\nI seemed to be rather rapidly losing ground, I heard some things\nthat gave me interest enough in mental healing to make me try it;\nI had no great hope of getting any good from it\u2014it was a _chance_\nI tried, partly because my thought was interested by the new\npossibility it seemed to open, partly because it was the only\nchance I then could see. I went to X. in Boston, from whom some\nfriends of mine had got, or thought that they had got, great help;\nthe treatment was a silent one; little was said, and that little\ncarried no conviction to my mind; whatever influence was exerted\nwas that of another person\u2019s thought or feeling silently projected\non to my unconscious mind, into my nervous system as it were, as\nwe sat still together. I believed from the start in the\n_possibility_ of such action, for I knew the power of the mind to\nshape, helping or hindering, the body\u2019s nerve\u2010activities, and I\nthought telepathy probable, although unproved, but I had no belief\nin it as more than a possibility, and no strong conviction nor any\nmystic or religious faith connected with my thought of it that\nmight have brought imagination strongly into play.\n\u201cI sat quietly with the healer for half an hour each day, at first\nwith no result; then, after ten days or so, I became quite\nsuddenly and swiftly conscious of a tide of new energy rising\nwithin me, a sense of power to pass beyond old halting\u2010places, of\npower to break the bounds that, though often tried before, had\nlong been veritable walls about my life, too high to climb. I\nbegan to read and walk as I had not done for years, and the change\nwas sudden, marked, and unmistakable. This tide seemed to mount\nfor some weeks, three or four perhaps, when, summer having come, I\ncame away, taking the treatment up again a few months later. The\nlift I got proved permanent, and left me slowly gaining ground\ninstead of losing it, but with this lift the influence seemed in a\nway to have spent itself, and, though my confidence in the reality\nof the power had gained immensely from this first experience, and\nshould have helped me to make further gain in health and strength\nif my belief in it had been the potent factor there, I never after\nthis got any result at all as striking or as clearly marked as\nthis which came when I made trial of it first, with little faith\nand doubtful expectation. It is difficult to put all the evidence\nin such a matter into words, to gather up into a distinct\nstatement all that one bases one\u2019s conclusions on, but I have\nalways felt that I had abundant evidence to justify (to myself, at\nleast) the conclusion that I came to then, and since have held to,\nthat the physical change which came at that time was, first, the\nresult of a change wrought within me by a change of mental state;\nand, secondly, that that change of mental state was not, save in a\nvery secondary way, brought about through the influence of an\nexcited imagination, or a _consciously_ received suggestion of an\nhypnotic sort. Lastly, I believe that this change was the result\nof my receiving telepathically, and upon a mental stratum quite\nbelow the level of immediate consciousness, a healthier and more\nenergetic attitude, receiving it from another person whose thought\nwas directed upon me with the intention of impressing the idea of\nthis attitude upon me. In my case the disease was distinctly what\nwould be classed as nervous, not organic; but from such\nopportunities as I have had of observing, I have come to the\nconclusion that the dividing line that has been drawn is an\narbitrary one, the nerves controlling the internal activities and\nthe nutrition of the body throughout; and I believe that the\ncentral nervous system, by starting and inhibiting local centres,\ncan exercise a vast influence upon disease of any kind, if it can\nbe brought to bear. In my judgment the question is simply how to\nbring it to bear, and I think that the uncertainty and remarkable\ndifferences in the results obtained through mental healing do but\nshow how ignorant we are as yet of the forces at work and of the\nmeans we should take to make them effective. That these results\nare not due to chance coincidences my observation of myself and\nothers makes me sure; that the conscious mind, the imagination,\nenters into them as a factor in many cases is doubtless true, but\nin many others, and sometimes very extraordinary ones, it hardly\nseems to enter in at all. On the whole I am inclined to think that\nas the healing action, like the morbid one, springs from the plane\nof the normally _un_conscious mind, so the strongest and most\neffective impressions are those which _it_ receives, in some as\nyet unknown, subtle way, _directly_ from a healthier mind whose\nstate, through a hidden law of sympathy, it reproduces.\u201d\nCASE II. \u201cAt the urgent request of friends, and with no faith and\nhardly any hope (possibly owing to a previous unsuccessful\nexperience with a Christian Scientist), our little daughter was\nplaced under the care of a healer, and cured of a trouble about\nwhich the physician had been very discouraging in his diagnosis.\nThis interested me, and I began studying earnestly the method and\nphilosophy of this method of healing. Gradually an inner peace and\ntranquillity came to me in so positive a way that my manner\nchanged greatly. My children and friends noticed the change and\ncommented upon it. All feelings of irritability disappeared. Even\nthe expression of my face changed noticeably.\n\u201cI had been bigoted, aggressive, and intolerant in discussion,\nboth in public and private. I grew broadly tolerant and receptive\ntoward the views of others. I had been nervous and irritable,\ncoming home two or three times a week with a sick headache\ninduced, as I then supposed, by dyspepsia and catarrh. I grew\nserene and gentle, and the physical troubles entirely disappeared.\nI had been in the habit of approaching every business interview\nwith an almost morbid dread. I now meet every one with confidence\nand inner calm.\n\u201cI may say that the growth has all been toward the elimination of\nselfishness. I do not mean simply the grosser, more sensual forms,\nbut those subtler and generally unrecognized kinds, such as\nexpress themselves in sorrow, grief, regret, envy, etc. It has\nbeen in the direction of a practical, working realization of the\nimmanence of God and the Divinity of man\u2019s true, inner self.\u201d\nLECTURES VI AND VII. THE SICK SOUL.\nAt our last meeting, we considered the healthy\u2010minded temperament, the\ntemperament which has a constitutional incapacity for prolonged suffering,\nand in which the tendency to see things optimistically is like a water of\ncrystallization in which the individual\u2019s character is set. We saw how\nthis temperament may become the basis for a peculiar type of religion, a\nreligion in which good, even the good of this world\u2019s life, is regarded as\nthe essential thing for a rational being to attend to. This religion\ndirects him to settle his scores with the more evil aspects of the\nuniverse by systematically declining to lay them to heart or make much of\nthem, by ignoring them in his reflective calculations, or even, on\noccasion, by denying outright that they exist. Evil is a disease; and\nworry over disease is itself an additional form of disease, which only\nadds to the original complaint. Even repentance and remorse, affections\nwhich come in the character of ministers of good, may be but sickly and\nrelaxing impulses. The best repentance is to up and act for righteousness,\nand forget that you ever had relations with sin.\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy has this sort of healthy\u2010mindedness woven into the\nheart of it, and this has been one secret of its fascination. He whom\nReason leads, according to Spinoza, is led altogether by the influence\nover his mind of good. Knowledge of evil is an \u201cinadequate\u201d knowledge, fit\nonly for slavish minds. So Spinoza categorically condemns repentance. When\nmen make mistakes, he says,\u2014\n\u201cOne might perhaps expect gnawings of conscience and repentance to\nhelp to bring them on the right path, and might thereupon conclude\n(as every one does conclude) that these affections are good\nthings. Yet when we look at the matter closely, we shall find that\nnot only are they not good, but on the contrary deleterious and\nevil passions. For it is manifest that we can always get along\nbetter by reason and love of truth than by worry of conscience and\nremorse. Harmful are these and evil, inasmuch as they form a\nparticular kind of sadness; and the disadvantages of sadness,\u201d he\ncontinues, \u201cI have already proved, and shown that we should strive\nto keep it from our life. Just so we should endeavor, since\nuneasiness of conscience and remorse are of this kind of\ncomplexion, to flee and shun these states of mind.\u201d(66)\nWithin the Christian body, for which repentance of sins has from the\nbeginning been the critical religious act, healthy\u2010mindedness has always\ncome forward with its milder interpretation. Repentance according to such\nhealthy\u2010minded Christians means _getting away from_ the sin, not groaning\nand writhing over its commission. The Catholic practice of confession and\nabsolution is in one of its aspects little more than a systematic method\nof keeping healthy\u2010mindedness on top. By it a man\u2019s accounts with evil are\nperiodically squared and audited, so that he may start the clean page with\nno old debts inscribed. Any Catholic will tell us how clean and fresh and\nfree he feels after the purging operation. Martin Luther by no means\nbelonged to the healthy\u2010minded type in the radical sense in which we have\ndiscussed it, and he repudiated priestly absolution for sin. Yet in this\nmatter of repentance he had some very healthy\u2010minded ideas, due in the\nmain to the largeness of his conception of God.\n\u201cWhen I was a monk,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought that I was utterly cast\naway, if at any time I felt the lust of the flesh: that is to say,\nif I felt any evil motion, fleshly lust, wrath, hatred, or envy\nagainst any brother. I assayed many ways to help to quiet my\nconscience, but it would not be; for the concupiscence and lust of\nmy flesh did always return, so that I could not rest, but was\ncontinually vexed with these thoughts: This or that sin thou hast\ncommitted: thou art infected with envy, with impatiency, and such\nother sins: therefore thou art entered into this holy order in\nvain, and all thy good works are unprofitable. But if then I had\nrightly understood these sentences of Paul: \u2018The flesh lusteth\ncontrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh; and\nthese two are one against another, so that ye cannot do the things\nthat ye would do,\u2019 I should not have so miserably tormented\nmyself, but should have thought and said to myself, as now\ncommonly I do, \u2018Martin, thou shalt not utterly be without sin, for\nthou hast flesh; thou shalt therefore feel the battle thereof.\u2019 I\nremember that Staupitz was wont to say, \u2018I have vowed unto God\nabove a thousand times that I would become a better man: but I\nnever performed that which I vowed. Hereafter I will make no such\nvow: for I have now learned by experience that I am not able to\nperform it. Unless, therefore, God be favorable and merciful unto\nme for Christ\u2019s sake, I shall not be able, with all my vows and\nall my good deeds, to stand before him.\u2019 This (of Staupitz\u2019s) was\nnot only a true, but also a godly and a holy desperation; and this\nmust they all confess, both with mouth and heart, who will be\nsaved. For the godly trust not to their own righteousness. They\nlook unto Christ their reconciler, who gave his life for their\nsins. Moreover, they know that the remnant of sin which is in\ntheir flesh is not laid to their charge, but freely pardoned.\nNotwithstanding, in the mean while they fight in spirit against\nthe flesh, lest they should _fulfill_ the lusts thereof; and\nalthough they feel the flesh to rage and rebel, and themselves\nalso do fall sometimes into sin through infirmity, yet are they\nnot discouraged, nor think therefore that their state and kind of\nlife, and the works which are done according to their calling,\ndisplease God; but they raise up themselves by faith.\u201d(67)\nOne of the heresies for which the Jesuits got that spiritual genius,\nMolinos, the founder of Quietism, so abominably condemned was his healthy\u2010\nminded opinion of repentance:\u2014\n\u201cWhen thou fallest into a fault, in what matter soever it be, do\nnot trouble nor afflict thyself for it. For they are effects of\nour frail Nature, stained by Original Sin. The common enemy will\nmake thee believe, as soon as thou fallest into any fault, that\nthou walkest in error, and therefore art out of God and his favor,\nand herewith would he make thee distrust of the divine Grace,\ntelling thee of thy misery, and making a giant of it; and putting\nit into thy head that every day thy soul grows worse instead of\nbetter, whilst it so often repeats these failings. O blessed Soul,\nopen thine eyes; and shut the gate against these diabolical\nsuggestions, knowing thy misery, and trusting in the mercy divine.\nWould not he be a mere fool who, running at tournament with\nothers, and falling in the best of the career, should lie weeping\non the ground and afflicting himself with discourses upon his\nfall? Man (they would tell him), lose no time, get up and take the\ncourse again, for he that rises again quickly and continues his\nrace is as if he had never fallen. If thou seest thyself fallen\nonce and a thousand times, thou oughtest to make use of the remedy\nwhich I have given thee, that is, a loving confidence in the\ndivine mercy. These are the weapons with which thou must fight and\nconquer cowardice and vain thoughts. This is the means thou\noughtest to use\u2014not to lose time, not to disturb thyself, and reap\nno good.\u201d(68)\nNow in contrast with such healthy\u2010minded views as these, if we treat them\nas a way of deliberately minimizing evil, stands a radically opposite\nview, a way of maximizing evil, if you please so to call it, based on the\npersuasion that the evil aspects of our life are of its very essence, and\nthat the world\u2019s meaning most comes home to us when we lay them most to\nheart. We have now to address ourselves to this more morbid way of looking\nat the situation. But as I closed our last hour with a general\nphilosophical reflection on the healthy\u2010minded way of taking life, I\nshould like at this point to make another philosophical reflection upon it\nbefore turning to that heavier task. You will excuse the brief delay.\nIf we admit that evil is an essential part of our being and the key to the\ninterpretation of our life, we load ourselves down with a difficulty that\nhas always proved burdensome in philosophies of religion. Theism, whenever\nit has erected itself into a systematic philosophy of the universe, has\nshown a reluctance to let God be anything less than All\u2010in\u2010All. In other\nwords, philosophic theism has always shown a tendency to become\npantheistic and monistic, and to consider the world as one unit of\nabsolute fact; and this has been at variance with popular or practical\ntheism, which latter has ever been more or less frankly pluralistic, not\nto say polytheistic, and shown itself perfectly well satisfied with a\nuniverse composed of many original principles, provided we be only allowed\nto believe that the divine principle remains supreme, and that the others\nare subordinate. In this latter case God is not necessarily responsible\nfor the existence of evil; he would only be responsible if it were not\nfinally overcome. But on the monistic or pantheistic view, evil, like\neverything else, must have its foundation in God; and the difficulty is to\nsee how this can possibly be the case if God be absolutely good. This\ndifficulty faces us in every form of philosophy in which the world appears\nas one flawless unit of fact. Such a unit is an _Individual_, and in it\nthe worst parts must be as essential as the best, must be as necessary to\nmake the individual what he is; since if any part whatever in an\nindividual were to vanish or alter, it would no longer be _that_\nindividual at all. The philosophy of absolute idealism, so vigorously\nrepresented both in Scotland and America to\u2010day, has to struggle with this\ndifficulty quite as much as scholastic theism struggled in its time; and\nalthough it would be premature to say that there is no speculative issue\nwhatever from the puzzle, it is perfectly fair to say that there is no\nclear or easy issue, and that the only _obvious_ escape from paradox here\nis to cut loose from the monistic assumption altogether, and to allow the\nworld to have existed from its origin in pluralistic form, as an aggregate\nor collection of higher and lower things and principles, rather than an\nabsolutely unitary fact. For then evil would not need to be essential; it\nmight be, and may always have been, an independent portion that had no\nrational or absolute right to live with the rest, and which we might\nconceivably hope to see got rid of at last.\nNow the gospel of healthy\u2010mindedness, as we have described it, casts its\nvote distinctly for this pluralistic view. Whereas the monistic\nphilosopher finds himself more or less bound to say, as Hegel said, that\neverything actual is rational, and that evil, as an element dialectically\nrequired, must be pinned in and kept and consecrated and have a function\nawarded to it in the final system of truth, healthy\u2010mindedness refuses to\nsay anything of the sort.(69) Evil, it says, is emphatically irrational,\nand _not_ to be pinned in, or preserved, or consecrated in any final\nsystem of truth. It is a pure abomination to the Lord, an alien unreality,\na waste element, to be sloughed off and negated, and the very memory of\nit, if possible, wiped out and forgotten. The ideal, so far from being co\u2010\nextensive with the whole actual, is a mere _extract_ from the actual,\nmarked by its deliverance from all contact with this diseased, inferior,\nand excrementitious stuff.\nHere we have the interesting notion fairly and squarely presented to us,\nof there being elements of the universe which may make no rational whole\nin conjunction with the other elements, and which, from the point of view\nof any system which those other elements make up, can only be considered\nso much irrelevance and accident\u2014so much \u201cdirt,\u201d as it were, and matter\nout of place. I ask you now not to forget this notion; for although most\nphilosophers seem either to forget it or to disdain it too much ever to\nmention it, I believe that we shall have to admit it ourselves in the end\nas containing an element of truth. The mind\u2010cure gospel thus once more\nappears to us as having dignity and importance. We have seen it to be a\ngenuine religion, and no mere silly appeal to imagination to cure disease;\nwe have seen its method of experimental verification to be not unlike the\nmethod of all science; and now here we find mind\u2010cure as the champion of a\nperfectly definite conception of the metaphysical structure of the world.\nI hope that, in view of all this, you will not regret my having pressed it\nupon your attention at such length.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLet us now say good\u2010by for a while to all this way of thinking, and turn\ntowards those persons who cannot so swiftly throw off the burden of the\nconsciousness of evil, but are congenitally fated to suffer from its\npresence. Just as we saw that in healthy\u2010mindedness there are shallower\nand profounder levels, happiness like that of the mere animal, and more\nregenerate sorts of happiness, so also are there different levels of the\nmorbid mind, and the one is much more formidable than the other. There are\npeople for whom evil means only a mal\u2010adjustment with _things_, a wrong\ncorrespondence of one\u2019s life with the environment. Such evil as this is\ncurable, in principle at least, upon the natural plane, for merely by\nmodifying either the self or the things, or both at once, the two terms\nmay be made to fit, and all go merry as a marriage bell again. But there\nare others for whom evil is no mere relation of the subject to particular\nouter things, but something more radical and general, a wrongness or vice\nin his essential nature, which no alteration of the environment, or any\nsuperficial rearrangement of the inner self, can cure, and which requires\na supernatural remedy. On the whole, the Latin races have leaned more\ntowards the former way of looking upon evil, as made up of ills and sins\nin the plural, removable in detail; while the Germanic races have tended\nrather to think of Sin in the singular, and with a capital S, as of\nsomething ineradicably ingrained in our natural subjectivity, and never to\nbe removed by any superficial piecemeal operations.(70) These comparisons\nof races are always open to exception, but undoubtedly the northern tone\nin religion has inclined to the more intimately pessimistic persuasion,\nand this way of feeling, being the more extreme, we shall find by far the\nmore instructive for our study.\nRecent psychology has found great use for the word \u201cthreshold\u201d as a\nsymbolic designation for the point at which one state of mind passes into\nanother. Thus we speak of the threshold of a man\u2019s consciousness in\ngeneral, to indicate the amount of noise, pressure, or other outer\nstimulus which it takes to arouse his attention at all. One with a high\nthreshold will doze through an amount of racket by which one with a low\nthreshold would be immediately waked. Similarly, when one is sensitive to\nsmall differences in any order of sensation, we say he has a low\n\u201cdifference\u2010threshold\u201d\u2014his mind easily steps over it into the\nconsciousness of the differences in question. And just so we might speak\nof a \u201cpain\u2010threshold,\u201d a \u201cfear\u2010threshold,\u201d a \u201cmisery\u2010threshold,\u201d and find\nit quickly overpassed by the consciousness of some individuals, but lying\ntoo high in others to be often reached by their consciousness. The\nsanguine and healthy\u2010minded live habitually on the sunny side of their\nmisery\u2010line, the depressed and melancholy live beyond it, in darkness and\napprehension. There are men who seem to have started in life with a bottle\nor two of champagne inscribed to their credit; whilst others seem to have\nbeen born close to the pain\u2010threshold, which the slightest irritants\nfatally send them over.\nDoes it not appear as if one who lived more habitually on one side of the\npain\u2010threshold might need a different sort of religion from one who\nhabitually lived on the other? This question, of the relativity of\ndifferent types of religion to different types of need, arises naturally\nat this point, and will become a serious problem ere we have done. But\nbefore we confront it in general terms, we must address ourselves to the\nunpleasant task of hearing what the sick souls, as we may call them in\ncontrast to the healthy\u2010minded, have to say of the secrets of their\nprison\u2010house, their own peculiar form of consciousness. Let us then\nresolutely turn our backs on the once\u2010born and their sky\u2010blue optimistic\ngospel; let us not simply cry out, in spite of all appearances, \u201cHurrah\nfor the Universe!\u2014God\u2019s in his Heaven, all\u2019s right with the world.\u201d Let us\nsee rather whether pity, pain, and fear, and the sentiment of human\nhelplessness may not open a profounder view and put into our hands a more\ncomplicated key to the meaning of the situation.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nTo begin with, how _can_ things so insecure as the successful experiences\nof this world afford a stable anchorage? A chain is no stronger than its\nweakest link, and life is after all a chain. In the healthiest and most\nprosperous existence, how many links of illness, danger, and disaster are\nalways interposed? Unsuspectedly from the bottom of every fountain of\npleasure, as the old poet said, something bitter rises up: a touch of\nnausea, a falling dead of the delight, a whiff of melancholy, things that\nsound a knell, for fugitive as they may be, they bring a feeling of coming\nfrom a deeper region and often have an appalling convincingness. The buzz\nof life ceases at their touch as a piano\u2010string stops sounding when the\ndamper falls upon it.\nOf course the music can commence again;\u2014and again and again,\u2014at intervals.\nBut with this the healthy\u2010minded consciousness is left with an\nirremediable sense of precariousness. It is a bell with a crack; it draws\nits breath on sufferance and by an accident.\nEven if we suppose a man so packed with healthy\u2010mindedness as never to\nhave experienced in his own person any of these sobering intervals, still,\nif he is a reflecting being, he must generalize and class his own lot with\nthat of others; and, doing so, he must see that his escape is just a lucky\nchance and no essential difference. He might just as well have been born\nto an entirely different fortune. And then indeed the hollow security!\nWhat kind of a frame of things is it of which the best you can say is,\n\u201cThank God, it has let me off clear this time!\u201d Is not its blessedness a\nfragile fiction? Is not your joy in it a very vulgar glee, not much unlike\nthe snicker of any rogue at his success? If indeed it were all success,\neven on such terms as that! But take the happiest man, the one most envied\nby the world, and in nine cases out of ten his inmost consciousness is one\nof failure. Either his ideals in the line of his achievements are pitched\nfar higher than the achievements themselves, or else he has secret ideals\nof which the world knows nothing, and in regard to which he inwardly knows\nhimself to be found wanting.\nWhen such a conquering optimist as Goethe can express himself in this\nwise, how must it be with less successful men?\n\u201cI will say nothing,\u201d writes Goethe in 1824, \u201cagainst the course\nof my existence. But at bottom it has been nothing but pain and\nburden, and I can affirm that during the whole of my 75 years, I\nhave not had four weeks of genuine well\u2010being. It is but the\nperpetual rolling of a rock that must be raised up again forever.\u201d\nWhat single\u2010handed man was ever on the whole as successful as Luther? yet\nwhen he had grown old, he looked back on his life as if it were an\nabsolute failure.\n\u201cI am utterly weary of life. I pray the Lord will come forthwith\nand carry me hence. Let him come, above all, with his last\nJudgment: I will stretch out my neck, the thunder will burst\nforth, and I shall be at rest.\u201d\u2014And having a necklace of white\nagates in his hand at the time he added: \u201cO God, grant that it may\ncome without delay. I would readily eat up this necklace to\u2010day,\nfor the Judgment to come to\u2010morrow.\u201d\u2014The Electress Dowager, one\nday when Luther was dining with her, said to him: \u201cDoctor, I wish\nyou may live forty years to come.\u201d \u201cMadam,\u201d replied he, \u201crather\nthan live forty years more, I would give up my chance of\nParadise.\u201d\nFailure, then, failure! so the world stamps us at every turn. We strew it\nwith our blunders, our misdeeds, our lost opportunities, with all the\nmemorials of our inadequacy to our vocation. And with what a damning\nemphasis does it then blot us out! No easy fine, no mere apology or formal\nexpiation, will satisfy the world\u2019s demands, but every pound of flesh\nexacted is soaked with all its blood. The subtlest forms of suffering\nknown to man are connected with the poisonous humiliations incidental to\nthese results.\nAnd they are pivotal human experiences. A process so ubiquitous and\neverlasting is evidently an integral part of life. \u201cThere is indeed one\nelement in human destiny,\u201d Robert Louis Stevenson writes, \u201cthat not\nblindness itself can controvert. Whatever else we are intended to do, we\nare not intended to succeed; failure is the fate allotted.\u201d(71) And our\nnature being thus rooted in failure, is it any wonder that theologians\nshould have held it to be essential, and thought that only through the\npersonal experience of humiliation which it engenders the deeper sense of\nlife\u2019s significance is reached?(72)\nBut this is only the first stage of the world\u2010sickness. Make the human\nbeing\u2019s sensitiveness a little greater, carry him a little farther over\nthe misery\u2010threshold, and the good quality of the successful moments\nthemselves when they occur is spoiled and vitiated. All natural goods\nperish. Riches take wings; fame is a breath; love is a cheat; youth and\nhealth and pleasure vanish. Can things whose end is always dust and\ndisappointment be the real goods which our souls require? Back of\neverything is the great spectre of universal death, the all\u2010encompassing\nblackness:\u2014\n\u201cWhat profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under\nthe Sun? I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and\nbehold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit. For that which\nbefalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; as the one dieth, so\ndieth the other; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust\nagain.... The dead know not anything, neither have they any more a\nreward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love and\ntheir hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any\nmore a portion for ever in anything that is done under the Sun....\nTruly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes\nto behold the Sun: but if a man live many years and rejoice in\nthem all, yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they\nshall be many.\u201d\nIn short, life and its negation are beaten up inextricably together. But\nif the life be good, the negation of it must be bad. Yet the two are\nequally essential facts of existence; and all natural happiness thus seems\ninfected with a contradiction. The breath of the sepulchre surrounds it.\nTo a mind attentive to this state of things and rightly subject to the\njoy\u2010destroying chill which such a contemplation engenders, the only relief\nthat healthy\u2010mindedness can give is by saying: \u201cStuff and nonsense, get\nout into the open air!\u201d or \u201cCheer up, old fellow, you\u2019ll be all right\nerelong, if you will only drop your morbidness!\u201d But in all seriousness,\ncan such bald animal talk as that be treated as a rational answer? To\nascribe religious value to mere happy\u2010go\u2010lucky contentment with one\u2019s\nbrief chance at natural good is but the very consecration of forgetfulness\nand superficiality. Our troubles lie indeed too deep for _that_ cure. The\nfact that we _can_ die, that we _can_ be ill at all, is what perplexes us;\nthe fact that we now for a moment live and are well is irrelevant to that\nperplexity. We need a life not correlated with death, a health not liable\nto illness, a kind of good that will not perish, a good in fact that flies\nbeyond the Goods of nature.\nIt all depends on how sensitive the soul may become to discords. \u201cThe\ntrouble with me is that I believe too much in common happiness and\ngoodness,\u201d said a friend of mine whose consciousness was of this sort,\n\u201cand nothing can console me for their transiency. I am appalled and\ndisconcerted at its being possible.\u201d And so with most of us: a little\ncooling down of animal excitability and instinct, a little loss of animal\ntoughness, a little irritable weakness and descent of the pain\u2010threshold,\nwill bring the worm at the core of all our usual springs of delight into\nfull view, and turn us into melancholy metaphysicians. The pride of life\nand glory of the world will shrivel. It is after all but the standing\nquarrel of hot youth and hoary eld. Old age has the last word: the purely\nnaturalistic look at life, however enthusiastically it may begin, is sure\nto end in sadness.\nThis sadness lies at the heart of every merely positivistic, agnostic, or\nnaturalistic scheme of philosophy. Let sanguine healthy\u2010mindedness do its\nbest with its strange power of living in the moment and ignoring and\nforgetting, still the evil background is really there to be thought of,\nand the skull will grin in at the banquet. In the practical life of the\nindividual, we know how his whole gloom or glee about any present fact\ndepends on the remoter schemes and hopes with which it stands related. Its\nsignificance and framing give it the chief part of its value. Let it be\nknown to lead nowhere, and however agreeable it may be in its immediacy,\nits glow and gilding vanish. The old man, sick with an insidious internal\ndisease, may laugh and quaff his wine at first as well as ever, but he\nknows his fate now, for the doctors have revealed it; and the knowledge\nknocks the satisfaction out of all these functions. They are partners of\ndeath and the worm is their brother, and they turn to a mere flatness.\nThe lustre of the present hour is always borrowed from the background of\npossibilities it goes with. Let our common experiences be enveloped in an\neternal moral order; let our suffering have an immortal significance; let\nHeaven smile upon the earth, and deities pay their visits; let faith and\nhope be the atmosphere which man breathes in;\u2014and his days pass by with\nzest; they stir with prospects, they thrill with remoter values. Place\nround them on the contrary the curdling cold and gloom and absence of all\npermanent meaning which for pure naturalism and the popular science\nevolutionism of our time are all that is visible ultimately, and the\nthrill stops short, or turns rather to an anxious trembling.\nFor naturalism, fed on recent cosmological speculations, mankind is in a\nposition similar to that of a set of people living on a frozen lake,\nsurrounded by cliffs over which there is no escape, yet knowing that\nlittle by little the ice is melting, and the inevitable day drawing near\nwhen the last film of it will disappear, and to be drowned ignominiously\nwill be the human creature\u2019s portion. The merrier the skating, the warmer\nand more sparkling the sun by day, and the ruddier the bonfires at night,\nthe more poignant the sadness with which one must take in the meaning of\nthe total situation.\nThe early Greeks are continually held up to us in literary works as models\nof the healthy\u2010minded joyousness which the religion of nature may\nengender. There was indeed much joyousness among the Greeks\u2014Homer\u2019s flow\nof enthusiasm for most things that the sun shines upon is steady. But even\nin Homer the reflective passages are cheerless,(73) and the moment the\nGreeks grew systematically pensive and thought of ultimates, they became\nunmitigated pessimists.(74) The jealousy of the gods, the nemesis that\nfollows too much happiness, the all\u2010encompassing death, fate\u2019s dark\nopacity, the ultimate and unintelligible cruelty, were the fixed\nbackground of their imagination. The beautiful joyousness of their\npolytheism is only a poetic modern fiction. They knew no joys comparable\nin quality of preciousness to those which we shall erelong see that\nBrahmans, Buddhists, Christians, Mohammedans, twice\u2010born people whose\nreligion is non\u2010naturalistic, get from their several creeds of mysticism\nand renunciation.\nStoic insensibility and Epicurean resignation were the farthest advance\nwhich the Greek mind made in that direction. The Epicurean said: \u201cSeek not\nto be happy, but rather to escape unhappiness; strong happiness is always\nlinked with pain; therefore hug the safe shore, and do not tempt the\ndeeper raptures. Avoid disappointment by expecting little, and by aiming\nlow; and above all do not fret.\u201d The Stoic said: \u201cThe only genuine good\nthat life can yield a man is the free possession of his own soul; all\nother goods are lies.\u201d Each of these philosophies is in its degree a\nphilosophy of despair in nature\u2019s boons. Trustful self\u2010abandonment to the\njoys that freely offer has entirely departed from both Epicurean and\nStoic; and what each proposes is a way of rescue from the resultant dust\u2010\nand\u2010ashes state of mind. The Epicurean still awaits results from economy\nof indulgence and damping of desire. The Stoic hopes for no results, and\ngives up natural good altogether. There is dignity in both these forms of\nresignation. They represent distinct stages in the sobering process which\nman\u2019s primitive intoxication with sense\u2010happiness is sure to undergo. In\nthe one the hot blood has grown cool, in the other it has become quite\ncold; and although I have spoken of them in the past tense, as if they\nwere merely historic, yet Stoicism and Epicureanism will probably be to\nall time typical attitudes, marking a certain definite stage accomplished\nin the evolution of the world\u2010sick soul.(75) They mark the conclusion of\nwhat we call the once\u2010born period, and represent the highest flights of\nwhat twice\u2010born religion would call the purely natural man\u2014Epicureanism,\nwhich can only by great courtesy be called a religion, showing his\nrefinement, and Stoicism exhibiting his moral will. They leave the world\nin the shape of an unreconciled contradiction, and seek no higher unity.\nCompared with the complex ecstasies which the supernaturally regenerated\nChristian may enjoy, or the oriental pantheist indulge in, their receipts\nfor equanimity are expedients which seem almost crude in their simplicity.\nPlease observe, however, that I am not yet pretending finally to _judge_\nany of these attitudes. I am only describing their variety.\nThe securest way to the rapturous sorts of happiness of which the twice\u2010\nborn make report has as an historic matter of fact been through a more\nradical pessimism than anything that we have yet considered. We have seen\nhow the lustre and enchantment may be rubbed off from the goods of nature.\nBut there is a pitch of unhappiness so great that the goods of nature may\nbe entirely forgotten, and all sentiment of their existence vanish from\nthe mental field. For this extremity of pessimism to be reached, something\nmore is needed than observation of life and reflection upon death. The\nindividual must in his own person become the prey of a pathological\nmelancholy. As the healthy\u2010minded enthusiast succeeds in ignoring evil\u2019s\nvery existence, so the subject of melancholy is forced in spite of himself\nto ignore that of all good whatever: for him it may no longer have the\nleast reality. Such sensitiveness and susceptibility to mental pain is a\nrare occurrence where the nervous constitution is entirely normal; one\nseldom finds it in a healthy subject even where he is the victim of the\nmost atrocious cruelties of outward fortune. So we note here the neurotic\nconstitution, of which I said so much in my first lecture, making its\nactive entrance on our scene, and destined to play a part in much that\nfollows. Since these experiences of melancholy are in the first instance\nabsolutely private and individual, I can now help myself out with personal\ndocuments. Painful indeed they will be to listen to, and there is almost\nan indecency in handling them in public. Yet they lie right in the middle\nof our path; and if we are to touch the psychology of religion at all\nseriously, we must be willing to forget conventionalities, and dive below\nthe smooth and lying official conversational surface.\nOne can distinguish many kinds of pathological depression. Sometimes it is\nmere passive joylessness and dreariness, discouragement, dejection, lack\nof taste and zest and spring. Professor Ribot has proposed the name\n_anhedonia_ to designate this condition.\n\u201cThe state of _anhedonia_, if I may coin a new word to pair off\nwith _analgesia_,\u201d he writes, \u201chas been very little studied, but\nit exists. A young girl was smitten with a liver disease which for\nsome time altered her constitution. She felt no longer any\naffection for her father and mother. She would have played with\nher doll, but it was impossible to find the least pleasure in the\nact. The same things which formerly convulsed her with laughter\nentirely failed to interest her now. Esquirol observed the case of\na very intelligent magistrate who was also a prey to hepatic\ndisease. Every emotion appeared dead within him. He manifested\nneither perversion nor violence, but complete absence of emotional\nreaction. If he went to the theatre, which he did out of habit, he\ncould find no pleasure there. The thought of his house, of his\nhome, of his wife, and of his absent children moved him as little,\nhe said, as a theorem of Euclid.\u201d(76)\nProlonged seasickness will in most persons produce a temporary condition\nof anhedonia. Every good, terrestrial or celestial, is imagined only to be\nturned from with disgust. A temporary condition of this sort, connected\nwith the religious evolution of a singularly lofty character, both\nintellectual and moral, is well described by the Catholic philosopher,\nFather Gratry, in his autobiographical recollections. In consequence of\nmental isolation and excessive study at the Polytechnic school, young\nGratry fell into a state of nervous exhaustion with symptoms which he thus\ndescribes:\u2014\n\u201cI had such a universal terror that I woke at night with a start,\nthinking that the Pantheon was tumbling on the Polytechnic school,\nor that the school was in flames, or that the Seine was pouring\ninto the Catacombs, and that Paris was being swallowed up. And\nwhen these impressions were past, all day long without respite I\nsuffered an incurable and intolerable desolation, verging on\ndespair. I thought myself, in fact, rejected by God, lost, damned!\nI felt something like the suffering of hell. Before that I had\nnever even thought of hell. My mind had never turned in that\ndirection. Neither discourses nor reflections had impressed me in\nthat way. I took no account of hell. Now, and all at once, I\nsuffered in a measure what is suffered there.\n\u201cBut what was perhaps still more dreadful is that every idea of\nheaven was taken away from me: I could no longer conceive of\nanything of the sort. Heaven did not seem to me worth going to. It\nwas like a vacuum; a mythological elysium, an abode of shadows\nless real than the earth. I could conceive no joy, no pleasure in\ninhabiting it. Happiness, joy, light, affection, love\u2014all these\nwords were now devoid of sense. Without doubt I could still have\ntalked of all these things, but I had become incapable of feeling\nanything in them, of understanding anything about them, of hoping\nanything from them, or of believing them to exist. There was my\ngreat and inconsolable grief! I neither perceived nor conceived\nany longer the existence of happiness or perfection. An abstract\nheaven over a naked rock. Such was my present abode for\neternity.\u201d(77)\nSo much for melancholy in the sense of incapacity for joyous feeling. A\nmuch worse form of it is positive and active anguish, a sort of psychical\nneuralgia wholly unknown to healthy life. Such anguish may partake of\nvarious characters, having sometimes more the quality of loathing;\nsometimes that of irritation and exasperation; or again of self\u2010mistrust\nand self\u2010despair; or of suspicion, anxiety, trepidation, fear. The patient\nmay rebel or submit; may accuse himself, or accuse outside powers; and he\nmay or he may not be tormented by the theoretical mystery of why he should\nso have to suffer. Most cases are mixed cases, and we should not treat our\nclassifications with too much respect. Moreover, it is only a relatively\nsmall proportion of cases that connect themselves with the religious\nsphere of experience at all. Exasperated cases, for instance, as a rule do\nnot. I quote now literally from the first case of melancholy on which I\nlay my hand. It is a letter from a patient in a French asylum.\n\u201cI suffer too much in this hospital, both physically and morally.\nBesides the burnings and the sleeplessness (for I no longer sleep\nsince I am shut up here, and the little rest I get is broken by\nbad dreams, and I am waked with a jump by nightmares, dreadful\nvisions, lightning, thunder, and the rest), fear, atrocious fear,\npresses me down, holds me without respite, never lets me go. Where\nis the justice in it all! What have I done to deserve this excess\nof severity? Under what form will this fear crush me? What would I\nnot owe to any one who would rid me of my life! Eat, drink, lie\nawake all night, suffer without interruption\u2014such is the fine\nlegacy I have received from my mother! What I fail to understand\nis this abuse of power. There are limits to everything, there is a\nmiddle way. But God knows neither middle way nor limits. I say\nGod, but why? All I have known so far has been the devil. After\nall, I am afraid of God as much as of the devil, so I drift along,\nthinking of nothing but suicide, but with neither courage nor\nmeans here to execute the act. As you read this, it will easily\nprove to you my insanity. The style and the ideas are incoherent\nenough\u2014I can see that myself. But I cannot keep myself from being\neither crazy or an idiot; and, as things are, from whom should I\nask pity? I am defenseless against the invisible enemy who is\ntightening his coils around me. I should be no better armed\nagainst him even if I saw him, or had seen him. Oh, if he would\nbut kill me, devil take him! Death, death, once for all! But I\nstop. I have raved to you long enough. I say raved, for I can\nwrite no otherwise, having neither brain nor thoughts left. O God!\nwhat a misfortune to be born! Born like a mushroom, doubtless\nbetween an evening and a morning; and how true and right I was\nwhen in our philosophy\u2010year in college I chewed the cud of\nbitterness with the pessimists. Yes, indeed, there is more pain in\nlife than gladness\u2014it is one long agony until the grave. Think how\ngay it makes me to remember that this horrible misery of mine,\ncoupled with this unspeakable fear, may last fifty, one hundred,\nwho knows how many more years!\u201d(78)\nThis letter shows two things. First, you see how the entire consciousness\nof the poor man is so choked with the feeling of evil that the sense of\nthere being any good in the world is lost for him altogether. His\nattention excludes it, cannot admit it: the sun has left his heaven. And\nsecondly you see how the querulous temper of his misery keeps his mind\nfrom taking a religious direction. Querulousness of mind tends in fact\nrather towards irreligion; and it has played, so far as I know, no part\nwhatever in the construction of religious systems.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nReligious melancholy must be cast in a more melting mood. Tolstoy has left\nus, in his book called My Confession, a wonderful account of the attack of\nmelancholy which led him to his own religious conclusions. The latter in\nsome respects are peculiar; but the melancholy presents two characters\nwhich make it a typical document for our present purpose. First it is a\nwell\u2010marked case of anhedonia, of passive loss of appetite for all life\u2019s\nvalues; and second, it shows how the altered and estranged aspect which\nthe world assumed in consequence of this stimulated Tolstoy\u2019s intellect to\na gnawing, carking questioning and effort for philosophic relief. I mean\nto quote Tolstoy at some length; but before doing so, I will make a\ngeneral remark on each of these two points.\nFirst on our spiritual judgments and the sense of value in general.\nIt is notorious that facts are compatible with opposite emotional\ncomments, since the same fact will inspire entirely different feelings in\ndifferent persons, and at different times in the same person; and there is\nno rationally deducible connection between any outer fact and the\nsentiments it may happen to provoke. These have their source in another\nsphere of existence altogether, in the animal and spiritual region of the\nsubject\u2019s being. Conceive yourself, if possible, suddenly stripped of all\nthe emotion with which your world now inspires you, and try to imagine it\n_as it exists_, purely by itself, without your favorable or unfavorable,\nhopeful or apprehensive comment. It will be almost impossible for you to\nrealize such a condition of negativity and deadness. No one portion of the\nuniverse would then have importance beyond another; and the whole\ncollection of its things and series of its events would be without\nsignificance, character, expression, or perspective. Whatever of value,\ninterest, or meaning our respective worlds may appear endued with are thus\npure gifts of the spectator\u2019s mind. The passion of love is the most\nfamiliar and extreme example of this fact. If it comes, it comes; if it\ndoes not come, no process of reasoning can force it. Yet it transforms the\nvalue of the creature loved as utterly as the sunrise transforms Mont\nBlanc from a corpse\u2010like gray to a rosy enchantment; and it sets the whole\nworld to a new tune for the lover and gives a new issue to his life. So\nwith fear, with indignation, jealousy, ambition, worship. If they are\nthere, life changes. And whether they shall be there or not depends almost\nalways upon non\u2010logical, often on organic conditions. And as the excited\ninterest which these passions put into the world is our gift to the world,\njust so are the passions themselves _gifts_,\u2014gifts to us, from sources\nsometimes low and sometimes high; but almost always non\u2010logical and beyond\nour control. How can the moribund old man reason back to himself the\nromance, the mystery, the imminence of great things with which our old\nearth tingled for him in the days when he was young and well? Gifts,\neither of the flesh or of the spirit; and the spirit bloweth where it\nlisteth; and the world\u2019s materials lend their surface passively to all the\ngifts alike, as the stage\u2010setting receives indifferently whatever\nalternating colored lights may be shed upon it from the optical apparatus\nin the gallery.\nMeanwhile the practically real world for each one of us, the effective\nworld of the individual, is the compound world, the physical facts and\nemotional values in indistinguishable combination. Withdraw or pervert\neither factor of this complex resultant, and the kind of experience we\ncall pathological ensues.\nIn Tolstoy\u2019s case the sense that life had any meaning whatever was for a\ntime wholly withdrawn. The result was a transformation in the whole\nexpression of reality. When we come to study the phenomenon of conversion\nor religious regeneration, we shall see that a not infrequent consequence\nof the change operated in the subject is a transfiguration of the face of\nnature in his eyes. A new heaven seems to shine upon a new earth. In\nmelancholiacs there is usually a similar change, only it is in the reverse\ndirection. The world now looks remote, strange, sinister, uncanny. Its\ncolor is gone, its breath is cold, there is no speculation in the eyes it\nglares with. \u201cIt is as if I lived in another century,\u201d says one asylum\npatient.\u2014\u201cI see everything through a cloud,\u201d says another, \u201cthings are not\nas they were, and I am changed.\u201d\u2014\u201cI see,\u201d says a third, \u201cI touch, but the\nthings do not come near me, a thick veil alters the hue and look of\neverything.\u201d\u2014\u201cPersons move like shadows, and sounds seem to come from a\ndistant world.\u201d\u2014\u201cThere is no longer any past for me; people appear so\nstrange; it is as if I could not see any reality, as if I were in a\ntheatre; as if people were actors, and everything were scenery; I can no\nlonger find myself; I walk, but why? Everything floats before my eyes, but\nleaves no impression.\u201d\u2014\u201cI weep false tears, I have unreal hands: the\nthings I see are not real things.\u201d\u2014Such are expressions that naturally\nrise to the lips of melancholy subjects describing their changed\nstate.(79)\nNow there are some subjects whom all this leaves a prey to the profoundest\nastonishment. The strangeness is wrong. The unreality cannot be. A mystery\nis concealed, and a metaphysical solution must exist. If the natural world\nis so double\u2010faced and unhomelike, what world, what thing is real? An\nurgent wondering and questioning is set up, a poring theoretic activity,\nand in the desperate effort to get into right relations with the matter,\nthe sufferer is often led to what becomes for him a satisfying religious\nsolution.\nAt about the age of fifty, Tolstoy relates that he began to have moments\nof perplexity, of what he calls arrest, as if he knew not \u201chow to live,\u201d\nor what to do. It is obvious that these were moments in which the\nexcitement and interest which our functions naturally bring had ceased.\nLife had been enchanting, it was now flat sober, more than sober, dead.\nThings were meaningless whose meaning had always been self\u2010evident. The\nquestions \u201cWhy?\u201d and \u201cWhat next?\u201d began to beset him more and more\nfrequently. At first it seemed as if such questions must be answerable,\nand as if he could easily find the answers if he would take the time; but\nas they ever became more urgent, he perceived that it was like those first\ndiscomforts of a sick man, to which he pays but little attention till they\nrun into one continuous suffering, and then he realizes that what he took\nfor a passing disorder means the most momentous thing in the world for\nhim, means his death.\nThese questions \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWherefore?\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d found no response.\n\u201cI felt,\u201d says Tolstoy, \u201cthat something had broken within me on\nwhich my life had always rested, that I had nothing left to hold\non to, and that morally my life had stopped. An invincible force\nimpelled me to get rid of my existence, in one way or another. It\ncannot be said exactly that I _wished_ to kill myself, for the\nforce which drew me away from life was fuller, more powerful, more\ngeneral than any mere desire. It was a force like my old\naspiration to live, only it impelled me in the opposite direction.\nIt was an aspiration of my whole being to get out of life.\n\u201cBehold me then, a man happy and in good health, hiding the rope\nin order not to hang myself to the rafters of the room where every\nnight I went to sleep alone; behold me no longer going shooting,\nlest I should yield to the too easy temptation of putting an end\nto myself with my gun.\n\u201cI did not know what I wanted. I was afraid of life; I was driven\nto leave it; and in spite of that I still hoped something from it.\n\u201cAll this took place at a time when so far as all my outer\ncircumstances went, I ought to have been completely happy. I had a\ngood wife who loved me and whom I loved; good children and a large\nproperty which was increasing with no pains taken on my part. I\nwas more respected by my kinsfolk and acquaintance than I had ever\nbeen; I was loaded with praise by strangers; and without\nexaggeration I could believe my name already famous. Moreover I\nwas neither insane nor ill. On the contrary, I possessed a\nphysical and mental strength which I have rarely met in persons of\nmy age. I could mow as well as the peasants, I could work with my\nbrain eight hours uninterruptedly and feel no bad effects.\n\u201cAnd yet I could give no reasonable meaning to any actions of my\nlife. And I was surprised that I had not understood this from the\nvery beginning. My state of mind was as if some wicked and stupid\njest was being played upon me by some one. One can live only so\nlong as one is intoxicated, drunk with life; but when one grows\nsober one cannot fail to see that it is all a stupid cheat. What\nis truest about it is that there is nothing even funny or silly in\nit; it is cruel and stupid, purely and simply.\n\u201cThe oriental fable of the traveler surprised in the desert by a\nwild beast is very old.\n\u201cSeeking to save himself from the fierce animal, the traveler\njumps into a well with no water in it; but at the bottom of this\nwell he sees a dragon waiting with open mouth to devour him. And\nthe unhappy man, not daring to go out lest he should be the prey\nof the beast, not daring to jump to the bottom lest he should be\ndevoured by the dragon, clings to the branches of a wild bush\nwhich grows out of one of the cracks of the well. His hands\nweaken, and he feels that he must soon give way to certain fate;\nbut still he clings, and sees two mice, one white, the other\nblack, evenly moving round the bush to which he hangs, and gnawing\noff its roots.\n\u201cThe traveler sees this and knows that he must inevitably perish;\nbut while thus hanging he looks about him and finds on the leaves\nof the bush some drops of honey. These he reaches with his tongue\nand licks them off with rapture.\n\u201cThus I hang upon the boughs of life, knowing that the inevitable\ndragon of death is waiting ready to tear me, and I cannot\ncomprehend why I am thus made a martyr. I try to suck the honey\nwhich formerly consoled me; but the honey pleases me no longer,\nand day and night the white mouse and the black mouse gnaw the\nbranch to which I cling. I can see but one thing: the inevitable\ndragon and the mice\u2014I cannot turn my gaze away from them.\n\u201cThis is no fable, but the literal incontestable truth which every\none may understand. What will be the outcome of what I do to\u2010day?\nOf what I shall do to\u2010morrow? What will be the outcome of all my\nlife? Why should I live? Why should I do anything? Is there in\nlife any purpose which the inevitable death which awaits me does\nnot undo and destroy?\n\u201cThese questions are the simplest in the world. From the stupid\nchild to the wisest old man, they are in the soul of every human\nbeing. Without an answer to them, it is impossible, as I\nexperienced, for life to go on.\n\u201c \u2018But perhaps,\u2019 I often said to myself, \u2018there may be something I\nhave failed to notice or to comprehend. It is not possible that\nthis condition of despair should be natural to mankind.\u2019 And I\nsought for an explanation in all the branches of knowledge\nacquired by men. I questioned painfully and protractedly and with\nno idle curiosity. I sought, not with indolence, but laboriously\nand obstinately for days and nights together. I sought like a man\nwho is lost and seeks to save himself,\u2014and I found nothing. I\nbecame convinced, moreover, that all those who before me had\nsought for an answer in the sciences have also found nothing. And\nnot only this, but that they have recognized that the very thing\nwhich was leading me to despair\u2014the meaningless absurdity of\nlife\u2014is the only incontestable knowledge accessible to man.\u201d\nTo prove this point, Tolstoy quotes the Buddha, Solomon, and Schopenhauer.\nAnd he finds only four ways in which men of his own class and society are\naccustomed to meet the situation. Either mere animal blindness, sucking\nthe honey without seeing the dragon or the mice,\u2014\u201cand from such a way,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cI can learn nothing, after what I now know;\u201d or reflective\nepicureanism, snatching what it can while the day lasts,\u2014which is only a\nmore deliberate sort of stupefaction than the first; or manly suicide; or\nseeing the mice and dragon and yet weakly and plaintively clinging to the\nbush of life.\nSuicide was naturally the consistent course dictated by the logical\nintellect.\n\u201cYet,\u201d says Tolstoy, \u201cwhilst my intellect was working, something\nelse in me was working too, and kept me from the deed\u2014a\nconsciousness of life, as I may call it, which was like a force\nthat obliged my mind to fix itself in another direction and draw\nme out of my situation of despair.... During the whole course of\nthis year, when I almost unceasingly kept asking myself how to end\nthe business, whether by the rope or by the bullet, during all\nthat time, alongside of all those movements of my ideas and\nobservations, my heart kept languishing with another pining\nemotion. I can call this by no other name than that of a thirst\nfor God. This craving for God had nothing to do with the movement\nof my ideas,\u2014in fact, it was the direct contrary of that\nmovement,\u2014but it came from my heart. It was like a feeling of\ndread that made me seem like an orphan and isolated in the midst\nof all these things that were so foreign. And this feeling of\ndread was mitigated by the hope of finding the assistance of some\none.\u201d(80)\nOf the process, intellectual as well as emotional, which, starting from\nthis idea of God, led to Tolstoy\u2019s recovery, I will say nothing in this\nlecture, reserving it for a later hour. The only thing that need interest\nus now is the phenomenon of his absolute disenchantment with ordinary\nlife, and the fact that the whole range of habitual values may, to a man\nas powerful and full of faculty as he was, come to appear so ghastly a\nmockery.\nWhen disillusionment has gone as far as this, there is seldom a\n_restitutio ad integrum_. One has tasted of the fruit of the tree, and the\nhappiness of Eden never comes again. The happiness that comes, when any\ndoes come,\u2014and often enough it fails to return in an acute form, though\nits form is sometimes very acute,\u2014is not the simple ignorance of ill, but\nsomething vastly more complex, including natural evil as one of its\nelements, but finding natural evil no such stumbling\u2010block and terror\nbecause it now sees it swallowed up in supernatural good. The process is\none of redemption, not of mere reversion to natural health, and the\nsufferer, when saved, is saved by what seems to him a second birth, a\ndeeper kind of conscious being than he could enjoy before.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWe find a somewhat different type of religious melancholy enshrined in\nliterature in John Bunyan\u2019s autobiography. Tolstoy\u2019s preoccupations were\nlargely objective, for the purpose and meaning of life in general was what\nso troubled him; but poor Bunyan\u2019s troubles were over the condition of his\nown personal self. He was a typical case of the psychopathic temperament,\nsensitive of conscience to a diseased degree, beset by doubts, fears, and\ninsistent ideas, and a victim of verbal automatisms, both motor and\nsensory. These were usually texts of Scripture which, sometimes damnatory\nand sometimes favorable, would come in a half\u2010hallucinatory form as if\nthey were voices, and fasten on his mind and buffet it between them like a\nshuttlecock. Added to this were a fearful melancholy self\u2010contempt and\ndespair.\n\u201cNay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse; now I am farther from\nconversion than ever I was before. If now I should have burned at\nthe stake, I could not believe that Christ had love for me; alas,\nI could neither hear him, nor see him, nor feel him, nor savor any\nof his things. Sometimes I would tell my condition to the people\nof God, which, when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell\nof the Promises. But they had as good have told me that I must\nreach the Sun with my finger as have bidden me receive or rely\nupon the Promise. [Yet] all this while as to the act of sinning, I\nnever was more tender than now; I durst not take a pin or stick,\nthough but so big as a straw, for my conscience now was sore, and\nwould smart at every touch; I could not tell how to speak my\nwords, for fear I should misplace them. Oh, how gingerly did I\nthen go, in all I did or said! I found myself as on a miry bog\nthat shook if I did but stir; and was as there left both by God\nand Christ, and the spirit, and all good things.\n\u201cBut my original and inward pollution, that was my plague and my\naffliction. By reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own eyes\nthan was a toad; and I thought I was so in God\u2019s eyes too. Sin and\ncorruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of my heart as\nwater would bubble out of a fountain. I could have changed heart\nwith anybody. I thought none but the Devil himself could equal me\nfor inward wickedness and pollution of mind. Sure, thought I, I am\nforsaken of God; and thus I continued a long while, even for some\nyears together.\n\u201cAnd now I was sorry that God had made me a man. The beasts,\nbirds, fishes, etc., I blessed their condition, for they had not a\nsinful nature; they were not obnoxious to the wrath of God; they\nwere not to go to hell\u2010fire after death. I could therefore have\nrejoiced, had my condition been as any of theirs. Now I blessed\nthe condition of the dog and toad, yea, gladly would I have been\nin the condition of the dog or horse, for I knew they had no soul\nto perish under the everlasting weight of Hell or Sin, as mine was\nlike to do. Nay, and though I saw this, felt this, and was broken\nto pieces with it, yet that which added to my sorrow was, that I\ncould not find with all my soul that I did desire deliverance. My\nheart was at times exceedingly hard. If I would have given a\nthousand pounds for a tear, I could not shed one; no, nor\nsometimes scarce desire to shed one.\n\u201cI was both a burthen and a terror to myself; nor did I ever so\nknow, as now, what it was to be weary of my life, and yet afraid\nto die. How gladly would I have been anything but myself! Anything\nbut a man! and in any condition but my own.\u201d(81)\nPoor patient Bunyan, like Tolstoy, saw the light again, but we must also\npostpone that part of his story to another hour. In a later lecture I will\nalso give the end of the experience of Henry Alline, a devoted evangelist\nwho worked in Nova Scotia a hundred years ago, and who thus vividly\ndescribes the high\u2010water mark of the religious melancholy which formed its\nbeginning. The type was not unlike Bunyan\u2019s.\n\u201cEverything I saw seemed to be a burden to me; the earth seemed\naccursed for my sake: all trees, plants, rocks, hills, and vales\nseemed to be dressed in mourning and groaning, under the weight of\nthe curse, and everything around me seemed to be conspiring my\nruin. My sins seemed to be laid open; so that I thought that every\none I saw knew them, and sometimes I was almost ready to\nacknowledge many things, which I thought they knew: yea sometimes\nit seemed to me as if every one was pointing me out as the most\nguilty wretch upon earth. I had now so great a sense of the vanity\nand emptiness of all things here below, that I knew the whole\nworld could not possibly make me happy, no, nor the whole system\nof creation. When I waked in the morning, the first thought would\nbe, Oh, my wretched soul, what shall I do, where shall I go? And\nwhen I laid down, would say, I shall be perhaps in hell before\nmorning. I would many times look on the beasts with envy, wishing\nwith all my heart I was in their place, that I might have no soul\nto lose; and when I have seen birds flying over my head, have\noften thought within myself, Oh, that I could fly away from my\ndanger and distress! Oh, how happy should I be, if I were in their\nplace!\u201d(82)\nEnvy of the placid beasts seems to be a very widespread affection in this\ntype of sadness.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe worst kind of melancholy is that which takes the form of panic fear.\nHere is an excellent example, for permission to print which I have to\nthank the sufferer. The original is in French, and though the subject was\nevidently in a bad nervous condition at the time of which he writes, his\ncase has otherwise the merit of extreme simplicity. I translate freely.\n\u201cWhilst in this state of philosophic pessimism and general\ndepression of spirits about my prospects, I went one evening into\na dressing\u2010room in the twilight to procure some article that was\nthere; when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just\nas if it came out of the darkness, a horrible fear of my own\nexistence. Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an\nepileptic patient whom I had seen in the asylum, a black\u2010haired\nyouth with greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all\nday on one of the benches, or rather shelves against the wall,\nwith his knees drawn up against his chin, and the coarse gray\nundershirt, which was his only garment, drawn over them inclosing\nhis entire figure. He sat there like a sort of sculptured Egyptian\ncat or Peruvian mummy, moving nothing but his black eyes and\nlooking absolutely non\u2010human. This image and my fear entered into\na species of combination with each other. _That shape am I_, I\nfelt, potentially. Nothing that I possess can defend me against\nthat fate, if the hour for it should strike for me as it struck\nfor him. There was such a horror of him, and such a perception of\nmy own merely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was as if\nsomething hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I\nbecame a mass of quivering fear. After this the universe was\nchanged for me altogether. I awoke morning after morning with a\nhorrible dread at the pit of my stomach, and with a sense of the\ninsecurity of life that I never knew before, and that I have never\nfelt since.(83) It was like a revelation; and although the\nimmediate feelings passed away, the experience has made me\nsympathetic with the morbid feelings of others ever since. It\ngradually faded, but for months I was unable to go out into the\ndark alone.\n\u201cIn general I dreaded to be left alone. I remember wondering how\nother people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so\nunconscious of that pit of insecurity beneath the surface of life.\nMy mother in particular, a very cheerful person, seemed to me a\nperfect paradox in her unconsciousness of danger, which you may\nwell believe I was very careful not to disturb by revelations of\nmy own state of mind. I have always thought that this experience\nof melancholia of mine had a religious bearing.\u201d\nOn asking this correspondent to explain more fully what he meant by these\nlast words, the answer he wrote was this:\u2014\n\u201cI mean that the fear was so invasive and powerful that if I had\nnot clung to scripture\u2010texts like \u2018The eternal God is my refuge,\u2019\netc., \u2018Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy\u2010laden,\u2019 etc.,\n\u2018I am the resurrection and the life,\u2019 etc., I think I should have\ngrown really insane.\u201d(84)\nThere is no need of more examples. The cases we have looked at are enough.\nOne of them gives us the vanity of mortal things; another the sense of\nsin; and the remaining one describes the fear of the universe;\u2014and in one\nor other of these three ways it always is that man\u2019s original optimism and\nself\u2010satisfaction get leveled with the dust.\nIn none of these cases was there any intellectual insanity or delusion\nabout matters of fact; but were we disposed to open the chapter of really\ninsane melancholia, with its hallucinations and delusions, it would be a\nworse story still\u2014desperation absolute and complete, the whole universe\ncoagulating about the sufferer into a material of overwhelming horror,\nsurrounding him without opening or end. Not the conception or intellectual\nperception of evil, but the grisly blood\u2010freezing heart\u2010palsying sensation\nof it close upon one, and no other conception or sensation able to live\nfor a moment in its presence. How irrelevantly remote seem all our usual\nrefined optimisms and intellectual and moral consolations in presence of a\nneed of help like this! Here is the real core of the religious problem:\nHelp! help! No prophet can claim to bring a final message unless he says\nthings that will have a sound of reality in the ears of victims such as\nthese. But the deliverance must come in as strong a form as the complaint,\nif it is to take effect; and that seems a reason why the coarser\nreligions, revivalistic, orgiastic, with blood and miracles and\nsupernatural operations, may possibly never be displaced. Some\nconstitutions need them too much.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nArrived at this point, we can see how great an antagonism may naturally\narise between the healthy\u2010minded way of viewing life and the way that\ntakes all this experience of evil as something essential. To this latter\nway, the morbid\u2010minded way, as we might call it, healthy\u2010mindedness pure\nand simple seems unspeakably blind and shallow. To the healthy\u2010minded way,\non the other hand, the way of the sick soul seems unmanly and diseased.\nWith their grubbing in rat\u2010holes instead of living in the light; with\ntheir manufacture of fears, and preoccupation with every unwholesome kind\nof misery, there is something almost obscene about these children of wrath\nand cravers of a second birth. If religious intolerance and hanging and\nburning could again become the order of the day, there is little doubt\nthat, however it may have been in the past, the healthy\u2010minded would at\npresent show themselves the less indulgent party of the two.\nIn our own attitude, not yet abandoned, of impartial onlookers, what are\nwe to say of this quarrel? It seems to me that we are bound to say that\nmorbid\u2010mindedness ranges over the wider scale of experience, and that its\nsurvey is the one that overlaps. The method of averting one\u2019s attention\nfrom evil, and living simply in the light of good is splendid as long as\nit will work. It will work with many persons; it will work far more\ngenerally than most of us are ready to suppose; and within the sphere of\nits successful operation there is nothing to be said against it as a\nreligious solution. But it breaks down impotently as soon as melancholy\ncomes; and even though one be quite free from melancholy one\u2019s self, there\nis no doubt that healthy\u2010mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical\ndoctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account\nfor are a genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best\nkey to life\u2019s significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to\nthe deepest levels of truth.\nThe normal process of life contains moments as bad as any of those which\ninsane melancholy is filled with, moments in which radical evil gets its\ninnings and takes its solid turn. The lunatic\u2019s visions of horror are all\ndrawn from the material of daily fact. Our civilization is founded on the\nshambles, and every individual existence goes out in a lonely spasm of\nhelpless agony. If you protest, my friend, wait till you arrive there\nyourself! To believe in the carnivorous reptiles of geologic times is hard\nfor our imagination\u2014they seem too much like mere museum specimens. Yet\nthere is no tooth in any one of those museum\u2010skulls that did not daily\nthrough long years of the foretime hold fast to the body struggling in\ndespair of some fated living victim. Forms of horror just as dreadful to\ntheir victims, if on a smaller spatial scale, fill the world about us to\u2010\nday. Here on our very hearths and in our gardens the infernal cat plays\nwith the panting mouse, or holds the hot bird fluttering in her jaws.\nCrocodiles and rattlesnakes and pythons are at this moment vessels of life\nas real as we are; their loathsome existence fills every minute of every\nday that drags its length along; and whenever they or other wild beasts\nclutch their living prey, the deadly horror which an agitated melancholiac\nfeels is the literally right reaction on the situation.(85)\nIt may indeed be that no religious reconciliation with the absolute\ntotality of things is possible. Some evils, indeed, are ministerial to\nhigher forms of good; but it may be that there are forms of evil so\nextreme as to enter into no good system whatsoever, and that, in respect\nof such evil, dumb submission or neglect to notice is the only practical\nresource. This question must confront us on a later day. But\nprovisionally, and as a mere matter of program and method, since the evil\nfacts are as genuine parts of nature as the good ones, the philosophic\npresumption should be that they have some rational significance, and that\nsystematic healthy\u2010mindedness, failing as it does to accord to sorrow,\npain, and death any positive and active attention whatever, is formally\nless complete than systems that try at least to include these elements in\ntheir scope.\nThe completest religions would therefore seem to be those in which the\npessimistic elements are best developed. Buddhism, of course, and\nChristianity are the best known to us of these. They are essentially\nreligions of deliverance: the man must die to an unreal life before he can\nbe born into the real life. In my next lecture, I will try to discuss some\nof the psychological conditions of this second birth. Fortunately from now\nonward we shall have to deal with more cheerful subjects than those which\nwe have recently been dwelling on.\nLECTURE VIII. THE DIVIDED SELF, AND THE PROCESS OF ITS UNIFICATION.\nThe last lecture was a painful one, dealing as it did with evil as a\npervasive element of the world we live in. At the close of it we were\nbrought into full view of the contrast between the two ways of looking at\nlife which are characteristic respectively of what we called the healthy\u2010\nminded, who need to be born only once, and of the sick souls, who must be\ntwice\u2010born in order to be happy. The result is two different conceptions\nof the universe of our experience. In the religion of the once\u2010born the\nworld is a sort of rectilinear or one\u2010storied affair, whose accounts are\nkept in one denomination, whose parts have just the values which naturally\nthey appear to have, and of which a simple algebraic sum of pluses and\nminuses will give the total worth. Happiness and religious peace consist\nin living on the plus side of the account. In the religion of the twice\u2010\nborn, on the other hand, the world is a double\u2010storied mystery. Peace\ncannot be reached by the simple addition of pluses and elimination of\nminuses from life. Natural good is not simply insufficient in amount and\ntransient, there lurks a falsity in its very being. Cancelled as it all is\nby death if not by earlier enemies, it gives no final balance, and can\nnever be the thing intended for our lasting worship. It keeps us from our\nreal good, rather; and renunciation and despair of it are our first step\nin the direction of the truth. There are two lives, the natural and the\nspiritual, and we must lose the one before we can participate in the\nother.\nIn their extreme forms, of pure naturalism and pure salvationism, the two\ntypes are violently contrasted; though here as in most other current\nclassifications, the radical extremes are somewhat ideal abstractions, and\nthe concrete human beings whom we oftenest meet are intermediate varieties\nand mixtures. Practically, however, you all recognize the difference: you\nunderstand, for example, the disdain of the methodist convert for the mere\nsky\u2010blue healthy\u2010minded moralist; and you likewise enter into the aversion\nof the latter to what seems to him the diseased subjectivism of the\nMethodist, dying to live, as he calls it, and making of paradox and the\ninversion of natural appearances the essence of God\u2019s truth.(86)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe psychological basis of the twice\u2010born character seems to be a certain\ndiscordancy or heterogeneity in the native temperament of the subject, an\nincompletely unified moral and intellectual constitution.\n\u201cHomo duplex, homo duplex!\u201d writes Alphonse Daudet. \u201cThe first\ntime that I perceived that I was two was at the death of my\nbrother Henri, when my father cried out so dramatically, \u2018He is\ndead, he is dead!\u2019 While my first self wept, my second self\nthought, \u2018How truly given was that cry, how fine it would be at\nthe theatre.\u2019 I was then fourteen years old.\n\u201cThis horrible duality has often given me matter for reflection.\nOh, this terrible second me, always seated whilst the other is on\nfoot, acting, living, suffering, bestirring itself. This second me\nthat I have never been able to intoxicate, to make shed tears, or\nput to sleep. And how it sees into things, and how it mocks!\u201d(87)\nRecent works on the psychology of character have had much to say upon this\npoint.(88) Some persons are born with an inner constitution which is\nharmonious and well balanced from the outset. Their impulses are\nconsistent with one another, their will follows without trouble the\nguidance of their intellect, their passions are not excessive, and their\nlives are little haunted by regrets. Others are oppositely constituted;\nand are so in degrees which may vary from something so slight as to result\nin a merely odd or whimsical inconsistency, to a discordancy of which the\nconsequences may be inconvenient in the extreme. Of the more innocent\nkinds of heterogeneity I find a good example in Mrs. Annie Besant\u2019s\nautobiography.\n\u201cI have ever been the queerest mixture of weakness and strength,\nand have paid heavily for the weakness. As a child I used to\nsuffer tortures of shyness, and if my shoe\u2010lace was untied would\nfeel shamefacedly that every eye was fixed on the unlucky string;\nas a girl I would shrink away from strangers and think myself\nunwanted and unliked, so that I was full of eager gratitude to any\none who noticed me kindly; as the young mistress of a house I was\nafraid of my servants, and would let careless work pass rather\nthan bear the pain of reproving the ill\u2010doer; when I have been\nlecturing and debating with no lack of spirit on the platform, I\nhave preferred to go without what I wanted at the hotel rather\nthan to ring and make the waiter fetch it. Combative on the\nplatform in defense of any cause I cared for, I shrink from\nquarrel or disapproval in the house, and am a coward at heart in\nprivate while a good fighter in public. How often have I passed\nunhappy quarters of an hour screwing up my courage to find fault\nwith some subordinate whom my duty compelled me to reprove, and\nhow often have I jeered at myself for a fraud as the doughty\nplatform combatant, when shrinking from blaming some lad or lass\nfor doing their work badly. An unkind look or word has availed to\nmake me shrink into myself as a snail into its shell, while, on\nthe platform, opposition makes me speak my best.\u201d(89)\nThis amount of inconsistency will only count as amiable weakness; but a\nstronger degree of heterogeneity may make havoc of the subject\u2019s life.\nThere are persons whose existence is little more than a series of zigzags,\nas now one tendency and now another gets the upper hand. Their spirit wars\nwith their flesh, they wish for incompatibles, wayward impulses interrupt\ntheir most deliberate plans, and their lives are one long drama of\nrepentance and of effort to repair misdemeanors and mistakes.\nHeterogeneous personality has been explained as the result of\ninheritance\u2014the traits of character of incompatible and antagonistic\nancestors are supposed to be preserved alongside of each other.(90) This\nexplanation may pass for what it is worth\u2014it certainly needs\ncorroboration. But whatever the cause of heterogeneous personality may be,\nwe find the extreme examples of it in the psychopathic temperament, of\nwhich I spoke in my first lecture. All writers about that temperament make\nthe inner heterogeneity prominent in their descriptions. Frequently,\nindeed, it is only this trait that leads us to ascribe that temperament to\na man at all. A \u201cd\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieur\u201d is simply a man of sensibility in\nmany directions, who finds more difficulty than is common in keeping his\nspiritual house in order and running his furrow straight, because his\nfeelings and impulses are too keen and too discrepant mutually. In the\nhaunting and insistent ideas, in the irrational impulses, the morbid\nscruples, dreads, and inhibitions which beset the psychopathic temperament\nwhen it is thoroughly pronounced, we have exquisite examples of\nheterogeneous personality. Bunyan had an obsession of the words, \u201cSell\nChrist for this, sell him for that, sell him, sell him!\u201d which would run\nthrough his mind a hundred times together, until one day out of breath\nwith retorting, \u201cI will not, I will not,\u201d he impulsively said, \u201cLet him go\nif he will,\u201d and this loss of the battle kept him in despair for over a\nyear. The lives of the saints are full of such blasphemous obsessions,\nascribed invariably to the direct agency of Satan. The phenomenon connects\nitself with the life of the subconscious self, so\u2010called, of which we must\nere\u2010long speak more directly.\nNow in all of us, however constituted, but to a degree the greater in\nproportion as we are intense and sensitive and subject to diversified\ntemptations, and to the greatest possible degree if we are decidedly\npsychopathic, does the normal evolution of character chiefly consist in\nthe straightening out and unifying of the inner self. The higher and the\nlower feelings, the useful and the erring impulses, begin by being a\ncomparative chaos within us\u2014they must end by forming a stable system of\nfunctions in right subordination. Unhappiness is apt to characterize the\nperiod of order\u2010making and struggle. If the individual be of tender\nconscience and religiously quickened, the unhappiness will take the form\nof moral remorse and compunction, of feeling inwardly vile and wrong, and\nof standing in false relations to the author of one\u2019s being and appointer\nof one\u2019s spiritual fate. This is the religious melancholy and \u201cconviction\nof sin\u201d that have played so large a part in the history of Protestant\nChristianity. The man\u2019s interior is a battle\u2010ground for what he feels to\nbe two deadly hostile selves, one actual, the other ideal. As Victor Hugo\nmakes his Mahomet say:\u2014\n\u201cJe suis le champ vil des sublimes combats:\nTant\u00f4t l\u2019homme d\u2019en haut, et tant\u00f4t l\u2019homme d\u2019en bas;\nEt le mal dans ma bouche avec le bien alterne,\nComme dans le d\u00e9sert le sable et la citerne.\u201d\nWrong living, impotent aspirations; \u201cWhat I would, that do I not; but what\nI hate, that do I,\u201d as Saint Paul says; self\u2010loathing, self\u2010despair; an\nunintelligible and intolerable burden to which one is mysteriously the\nheir.\nLet me quote from some typical cases of discordant personality, with\nmelancholy in the form of self\u2010condemnation and sense of sin. Saint\nAugustine\u2019s case is a classic example. You all remember his half\u2010pagan,\nhalf\u2010Christian bringing up at Carthage, his emigration to Rome and Milan,\nhis adoption of Manicheism and subsequent skepticism, and his restless\nsearch for truth and purity of life; and finally how, distracted by the\nstruggle between the two souls in his breast, and ashamed of his own\nweakness of will, when so many others whom he knew and knew of had thrown\noff the shackles of sensuality and dedicated themselves to chastity and\nthe higher life, he heard a voice in the garden say, \u201c_Sume, lege_\u201d (take\nand read), and opening the Bible at random, saw the text, \u201cnot in\nchambering and wantonness,\u201d etc., which seemed directly sent to his\naddress, and laid the inner storm to rest forever.(91) Augustine\u2019s\npsychological genius has given an account of the trouble of having a\ndivided self which has never been surpassed.\n\u201cThe new will which I began to have was not yet strong enough to\novercome that other will, strengthened by long indulgence. So\nthese two wills, one old, one new, one carnal, the other\nspiritual, contended with each other and disturbed my soul. I\nunderstood by my own experience what I had read, \u2018flesh lusteth\nagainst spirit, and spirit against flesh.\u2019 It was myself indeed in\nboth the wills, yet more myself in that which I approved in myself\nthan in that which I disapproved in myself. Yet it was through\nmyself that habit had attained so fierce a mastery over me,\nbecause I had willingly come whither I willed not. Still bound to\nearth, I refused, O God, to fight on thy side, as much afraid to\nbe freed from all bonds, as I ought to have feared being trammeled\nby them.\n\u201cThus the thoughts by which I meditated upon thee were like the\nefforts of one who would awake, but being overpowered with\nsleepiness is soon asleep again. Often does a man when heavy\nsleepiness is on his limbs defer to shake it off, and though not\napproving it, encourage it; even so I was sure it was better to\nsurrender to thy love than to yield to my own lusts, yet, though\nthe former course convinced me, the latter pleased and held me\nbound. There was naught in me to answer thy call, \u2018Awake, thou\nsleeper,\u2019 but only drawling, drowsy words, \u2018Presently; yes,\npresently; wait a little while.\u2019 But the \u2018presently\u2019 had no\n\u2018present,\u2019 and the \u2018little while\u2019 grew long.... For I was afraid\nthou wouldst hear me too soon, and heal me at once of my disease\nof lust, which I wished to satiate rather than to see\nextinguished. With what lashes of words did I not scourge my own\nsoul. Yet it shrank back; it refused, though it had no excuse to\noffer.... I said within myself: \u2018Come, let it be done now,\u2019 and as\nI said it, I was on the point of the resolve. I all but did it,\nyet I did not do it. And I made another effort, and almost\nsucceeded, yet I did not reach it, and did not grasp it,\nhesitating to die to death, and live to life; and the evil to\nwhich I was so wonted held me more than the better life I had not\ntried.\u201d(92)\nThere could be no more perfect description of the divided will, when the\nhigher wishes lack just that last acuteness, that touch of explosive\nintensity, of dynamogenic quality (to use the slang of the psychologists),\nthat enables them to burst their shell, and make irruption efficaciously\ninto life and quell the lower tendencies forever. In a later lecture we\nshall have much to say about this higher excitability.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI find another good description of the divided will in the autobiography\nof Henry Alline, the Nova Scotian evangelist, of whose melancholy I read a\nbrief account in my last lecture. The poor youth\u2019s sins were, as you will\nsee, of the most harmless order, yet they interfered with what proved to\nbe his truest vocation, so they gave him great distress.\n\u201cI was now very moral in my life, but found no rest of conscience.\nI now began to be esteemed in young company, who knew nothing of\nmy mind all this while, and their esteem began to be a snare to my\nsoul, for I soon began to be fond of carnal mirth, though I still\nflattered myself that if I did not get drunk, nor curse, nor\nswear, there would be no sin in frolicking and carnal mirth, and I\nthought God would indulge young people with some (what I called\nsimple or civil) recreation. I still kept a round of duties, and\nwould not suffer myself to run into any open vices, and so got\nalong very well in time of health and prosperity, but when I was\ndistressed or threatened by sickness, death, or heavy storms of\nthunder, my religion would not do, and I found there was something\nwanting, and would begin to repent my going so much to frolics,\nbut when the distress was over, the devil and my own wicked heart,\nwith the solicitations of my associates, and my fondness for young\ncompany, were such strong allurements, I would again give way, and\nthus I got to be very wild and rude, at the same time kept up my\nrounds of secret prayer and reading; but God, not willing I should\ndestroy myself, still followed me with his calls, and moved with\nsuch power upon my conscience, that I could not satisfy myself\nwith my diversions, and in the midst of my mirth sometimes would\nhave such a sense of my lost and undone condition, that I would\nwish myself from the company, and after it was over, when I went\nhome, would make many promises that I would attend no more on\nthese frolics, and would beg forgiveness for hours and hours; but\nwhen I came to have the temptation again, I would give way: no\nsooner would I hear the music and drink a glass of wine, but I\nwould find my mind elevated and soon proceed to any sort of\nmerriment or diversion, that I thought was not debauched or openly\nvicious; but when I returned from my carnal mirth I felt as guilty\nas ever, and could sometimes not close my eyes for some hours\nafter I had gone to my bed. I was one of the most unhappy\ncreatures on earth.\n\u201cSometimes I would leave the company (often speaking to the\nfiddler to cease from playing, as if I was tired), and go out and\nwalk about crying and praying, as if my very heart would break,\nand beseeching God that he would not cut me off, nor give me up to\nhardness of heart. Oh, what unhappy hours and nights I thus wore\naway! When I met sometimes with merry companions, and my heart was\nready to sink, I would labor to put on as cheerful a countenance\nas possible, that they might not distrust anything, and sometimes\nwould begin some discourse with young men or young women on\npurpose, or propose a merry song, lest the distress of my soul\nwould be discovered, or mistrusted, when at the same time I would\nthen rather have been in a wilderness in exile, than with them or\nany of their pleasures or enjoyments. Thus for many months when I\nwas in company, I would act the hypocrite and feign a merry heart,\nbut at the same time would endeavor as much as I could to shun\ntheir company, oh wretched and unhappy mortal that I was!\nEverything I did, and wherever I went, I was still in a storm, and\nyet I continued to be the chief contriver and ringleader of the\nfrolics for many months after; though it was a toil and torment to\nattend them; but the devil and my own wicked heart drove me about\nlike a slave, telling me that I must do this and do that, and bear\nthis and bear that, and turn here and turn there, to keep my\ncredit up, and retain the esteem of my associates: and all this\nwhile I continued as strict as possible in my duties, and left no\nstone unturned to pacify my conscience, watching even against my\nthoughts, and praying continually wherever I went: for I did not\nthink there was any sin in my conduct, when I was among carnal\ncompany, because I did not take any satisfaction there, but only\nfollowed it, I thought, for sufficient reasons.\n\u201cBut still, all that I did or could do, conscience would roar\nnight and day.\u201d\nSaint Augustine and Alline both emerged into the smooth waters of inner\nunity and peace, and I shall next ask you to consider more closely some of\nthe peculiarities of the process of unification, when it occurs. It may\ncome gradually, or it may occur abruptly; it may come through altered\nfeelings, or through altered powers of action; or it may come through new\nintellectual insights, or through experiences which we shall later have to\ndesignate as \u201cmystical.\u201d However it come, it brings a characteristic sort\nof relief; and never such extreme relief as when it is cast into the\nreligious mould. Happiness! happiness! religion is only one of the ways in\nwhich men gain that gift. Easily, permanently, and successfully, it often\ntransforms the most intolerable misery into the profoundest and most\nenduring happiness.\nBut to find religion is only one out of many ways of reaching unity; and\nthe process of remedying inner incompleteness and reducing inner discord\nis a general psychological process, which may take place with any sort of\nmental material, and need not necessarily assume the religious form. In\njudging of the religious types of regeneration which we are about to\nstudy, it is important to recognize that they are only one species of a\ngenus that contains other types as well. For example, the new birth may be\naway from religion into incredulity; or it may be from moral scrupulosity\ninto freedom and license; or it may be produced by the irruption into the\nindividual\u2019s life of some new stimulus or passion, such as love, ambition,\ncupidity, revenge, or patriotic devotion. In all these instances we have\nprecisely the same psychological form of event,\u2014a firmness, stability, and\nequilibrium succeeding a period of storm and stress and inconsistency. In\nthese non\u2010religious cases the new man may also be born either gradually or\nsuddenly.\nThe French philosopher Jouffroy has left an eloquent memorial of his own\n\u201ccounter\u2010conversion,\u201d as the transition from orthodoxy to infidelity has\nbeen well styled by Mr. Starbuck. Jouffroy\u2019s doubts had long harassed him;\nbut he dates his final crisis from a certain night when his disbelief grew\nfixed and stable, and where the immediate result was sadness at the\nillusions he had lost.\n\u201cI shall never forget that night of December,\u201d writes Jouffroy,\n\u201cin which the veil that concealed from me my own incredulity was\ntorn. I hear again my steps in that narrow naked chamber where\nlong after the hour of sleep had come I had the habit of walking\nup and down. I see again that moon, half\u2010veiled by clouds, which\nnow and again illuminated the frigid window\u2010panes. The hours of\nthe night flowed on and I did not note their passage. Anxiously I\nfollowed my thoughts, as from layer to layer they descended\ntowards the foundation of my consciousness, and, scattering one by\none all the illusions which until then had screened its windings\nfrom my view, made them every moment more clearly visible.\n\u201cVainly I clung to these last beliefs as a shipwrecked sailor\nclings to the fragments of his vessel; vainly, frightened at the\nunknown void in which I was about to float, I turned with them\ntowards my childhood, my family, my country, all that was dear and\nsacred to me: the inflexible current of my thought was too\nstrong,\u2014parents, family, memory, beliefs, it forced me to let go\nof everything. The investigation went on more obstinate and more\nsevere as it drew near its term, and did not stop until the end\nwas reached. I knew then that in the depth of my mind nothing was\nleft that stood erect.\n\u201cThis moment was a frightful one; and when towards morning I threw\nmyself exhausted on my bed, I seemed to feel my earlier life, so\nsmiling and so full, go out like a fire, and before me another\nlife opened, sombre and unpeopled, where in future I must live\nalone, alone with my fatal thought which had exiled me thither,\nand which I was tempted to curse. The days which followed this\ndiscovery were the saddest of my life.\u201d(93)\nIn John Foster\u2019s Essay on Decision of Character, there is an account of a\ncase of sudden conversion to avarice, which is illustrative enough to\nquote:\u2014\nA young man, it appears, \u201cwasted, in two or three years, a large\npatrimony in profligate revels with a number of worthless\nassociates who called themselves his friends, and who, when his\nlast means were exhausted, treated him of course with neglect or\ncontempt. Reduced to absolute want, he one day went out of the\nhouse with an intention to put an end to his life; but wandering\nawhile almost unconsciously, he came to the brow of an eminence\nwhich overlooked what were lately his estates. Here he sat down,\nand remained fixed in thought a number of hours, at the end of\nwhich he sprang from the ground with a vehement, exulting emotion.\nHe had formed his resolution, which was, that all these estates\nshould be his again; he had formed his plan, too, which he\ninstantly began to execute. He walked hastily forward, determined\nto seize the first opportunity, of however humble a kind, to gain\nany money, though it were ever so despicable a trifle, and\nresolved absolutely not to spend, if he could help it, a farthing\nof whatever he might obtain. The first thing that drew his\nattention was a heap of coals shot out of carts on the pavement\nbefore a house. He offered himself to shovel or wheel them into\nthe place where they were to be laid, and was employed. He\nreceived a few pence for the labor; and then, in pursuance of the\nsaving part of his plan, requested some small gratuity of meat and\ndrink, which was given him. He then looked out for the next thing\nthat might chance; and went, with indefatigable industry, through\na succession of servile employments in different places, of longer\nand shorter duration, still scrupulous in avoiding, as far as\npossible, the expense of a penny. He promptly seized every\nopportunity which could advance his design, without regarding the\nmeanness of occupation or appearance. By this method he had\ngained, after a considerable time, money enough to purchase in\norder to sell again a few cattle, of which he had taken pains to\nunderstand the value. He speedily but cautiously turned his first\ngains into second advantages; retained without a single deviation\nhis extreme parsimony; and thus advanced by degrees into larger\ntransactions and incipient wealth. I did not hear, or have\nforgotten, the continued course of his life, but the final result\nwas, that he more than recovered his lost possessions, and died an\ninveterate miser, worth \u00a360,000.\u201d(94)\nLet me turn now to the kind of case, the religious case, namely, that\nimmediately concerns us. Here is one of the simplest possible type, an\naccount of the conversion to the systematic religion of healthy\u2010mindedness\nof a man who must already have been naturally of the healthy\u2010minded type.\nIt shows how, when the fruit is ripe, a touch will make it fall.\nMr. Horace Fletcher, in his little book called Menticulture, relates that\na friend with whom he was talking of the self\u2010control attained by the\nJapanese through their practice of the Buddhist discipline said:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018You must first get rid of anger and worry.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018is\nthat possible?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 replied he; \u2018it is possible to the\nJapanese, and ought to be possible to us.\u2019\n\u201cOn my way back I could think of nothing else but the words \u2018get\nrid, get rid\u2019; and the idea must have continued to possess me\nduring my sleeping hours, for the first consciousness in the\nmorning brought back the same thought, with the revelation of a\ndiscovery, which framed itself into the reasoning, \u2018If it is\npossible to get rid of anger and worry, why is it necessary to\nhave them at all?\u2019 I felt the strength of the argument, and at\nonce accepted the reasoning. The baby had discovered that it could\nwalk. It would scorn to creep any longer.\n\u201cFrom the instant I realized that these cancer spots of worry and\nanger were removable, they left me. With the discovery of their\nweakness they were exorcised. From that time life has had an\nentirely different aspect.\n\u201cAlthough from that moment the possibility and desirability of\nfreedom from the depressing passions has been a reality to me, it\ntook me some months to feel absolute security in my new position;\nbut, as the usual occasions for worry and anger have presented\nthemselves over and over again, and I have been unable to feel\nthem in the slightest degree, I no longer dread or guard against\nthem, and I am amazed at my increased energy and vigor of mind; at\nmy strength to meet situations of all kinds, and at my disposition\nto love and appreciate everything.\n\u201cI have had occasion to travel more than ten thousand miles by\nrail since that morning. The same Pullman porter, conductor,\nhotel\u2010waiter, peddler, book\u2010agent, cabman, and others who were\nformerly a source of annoyance and irritation have been met, but I\nam not conscious of a single incivility. All at once the whole\nworld has turned good to me. I have become, as it were, sensitive\nonly to the rays of good.\n\u201cI could recount many experiences which prove a brand\u2010new\ncondition of mind, but one will be sufficient. Without the\nslightest feeling of annoyance or impatience, I have seen a train\nthat I had planned to take with a good deal of interested and\npleasurable anticipation move out of the station without me,\nbecause my baggage did not arrive. The porter from the hotel came\nrunning and panting into the station just as the train pulled out\nof sight. When he saw me, he looked as if he feared a scolding,\nand began to tell of being blocked in a crowded street and unable\nto get out. When he had finished, I said to him: \u2018It doesn\u2019t\nmatter at all, you couldn\u2019t help it, so we will try again to\u2010\nmorrow. Here is your fee, I am sorry you had all this trouble in\nearning it.\u2019 The look of surprise that came over his face was so\nfilled with pleasure that I was repaid on the spot for the delay\nin my departure. Next day he would not accept a cent for the\nservice, and he and I are friends for life.\n\u201cDuring the first weeks of my experience I was on guard only\nagainst worry and anger; but, in the mean time, having noticed the\nabsence of the other depressing and dwarfing passions, I began to\ntrace a relationship, until I was convinced that they are all\ngrowths from the two roots I have specified. I have felt the\nfreedom now for so long a time that I am sure of my relation\ntoward it; and I could no more harbor any of the thieving and\ndepressing influences that once I nursed as a heritage of humanity\nthan a fop would voluntarily wallow in a filthy gutter.\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that pure Christianity and pure\nBuddhism, and the Mental Sciences and all Religions, fundamentally\nteach what has been a discovery to me; but none of them have\npresented it in the light of a simple and easy process of\nelimination. At one time I wondered if the elimination would not\nyield to indifference and sloth. In my experience, the contrary is\nthe result. I feel such an increased desire to do something useful\nthat it seems as if I were a boy again and the energy for play had\nreturned. I could fight as readily as (and better than) ever, if\nthere were occasion for it. It does not make one a coward. It\ncan\u2019t, since fear is one of the things eliminated. I notice the\nabsence of timidity in the presence of any audience. When a boy, I\nwas standing under a tree which was struck by lightning, and\nreceived a shock from the effects of which I never knew exemption\nuntil I had dissolved partnership with worry. Since then,\nlightning and thunder have been encountered under conditions which\nwould formerly have caused great depression and discomfort,\nwithout [my] experiencing a trace of either. Surprise is also\ngreatly modified, and one is less liable to become startled by\nunexpected sights or noises.\n\u201cAs far as I am individually concerned, I am not bothering myself\nat present as to what the results of this emancipated condition\nmay be. I have no doubt that the perfect health aimed at by\nChristian Science may be one of the possibilities, for I note a\nmarked improvement in the way my stomach does its duty in\nassimilating the food I give it to handle, and I am sure it works\nbetter to the sound of a song than under the friction of a frown.\nNeither am I wasting any of this precious time formulating an idea\nof a future existence or a future Heaven. The Heaven that I have\nwithin myself is as attractive as any that has been promised or\nthat I can imagine; and I am willing to let the growth lead where\nit will, as long as the anger and their brood have no part in\nmisguiding it.\u201d(95)\nThe older medicine used to speak of two ways, _lysis_ and _crisis_, one\ngradual, the other abrupt, in which one might recover from a bodily\ndisease. In the spiritual realm there are also two ways, one gradual, the\nother sudden, in which inner unification may occur. Tolstoy and Bunyan may\nagain serve us as examples, examples, as it happens, of the gradual way,\nthough it must be confessed at the outset that it is hard to follow these\nwindings of the hearts of others, and one feels that their words do not\nreveal their total secret.\nHowe\u2019er this be, Tolstoy, pursuing his unending questioning, seemed to\ncome to one insight after another. First he perceived that his conviction\nthat life was meaningless took only this finite life into account. He was\nlooking for the value of one finite term in that of another, and the whole\nresult could only be one of those indeterminate equations in mathematics\nwhich end with 0=0. Yet this is as far as the reasoning intellect by\nitself can go, unless irrational sentiment or faith brings in the\ninfinite. Believe in the infinite as common people do, and life grows\npossible again.\n\u201cSince mankind has existed, wherever life has been, there also has\nbeen the faith that gave the possibility of living. Faith is the\nsense of life, that sense by virtue of which man does not destroy\nhimself, but continues to live on. It is the force whereby we\nlive. If Man did not believe that he must live for something, he\nwould not live at all. The idea of an infinite God, of the\ndivinity of the soul, of the union of men\u2019s actions with God\u2014these\nare ideas elaborated in the infinite secret depths of human\nthought. They are ideas without which there would be no life,\nwithout which I myself,\u201d said Tolstoy, \u201cwould not exist. I began\nto see that I had no right to rely on my individual reasoning and\nneglect these answers given by faith, for they are the only\nanswers to the question.\u201d\nYet how believe as the common people believe, steeped as they are in\ngrossest superstition? It is impossible,\u2014but yet their life! their life!\nIt is normal. It is happy! It is an answer to the question!\nLittle by little, Tolstoy came to the settled conviction\u2014he says it took\nhim two years to arrive there\u2014that his trouble had not been with life in\ngeneral, not with the common life of common men, but with the life of the\nupper, intellectual, artistic classes, the life which he had personally\nalways led, the cerebral life, the life of conventionality, artificiality,\nand personal ambition. He had been living wrongly and must change. To work\nfor animal needs, to abjure lies and vanities, to relieve common wants, to\nbe simple, to believe in God, therein lay happiness again.\n\u201cI remember,\u201d he says, \u201cone day in early spring, I was alone in\nthe forest, lending my ear to its mysterious noises. I listened,\nand my thought went back to what for these three years it always\nwas busy with\u2014the quest of God. But the idea of him, I said, how\ndid I ever come by the idea?\n\u201cAnd again there arose in me, with this thought, glad aspirations\ntowards life. Everything in me awoke and received a meaning....\nWhy do I look farther? a voice within me asked. He is there: he,\nwithout whom one cannot live. To acknowledge God and to live are\none and the same thing. God is what life is. Well, then! live,\nseek God, and there will be no life without him....\n\u201cAfter this, things cleared up within me and about me better than\never, and the light has never wholly died away. I was saved from\nsuicide. Just how or when the change took place I cannot tell. But\nas insensibly and gradually as the force of life had been annulled\nwithin me, and I had reached my moral death\u2010bed, just as gradually\nand imperceptibly did the energy of life come back. And what was\nstrange was that this energy that came back was nothing new. It\nwas my ancient juvenile force of faith, the belief that the sole\npurpose of my life was to be _better_. I gave up the life of the\nconventional world, recognizing it to be no life, but a parody on\nlife, which its superfluities simply keep us from\ncomprehending,\u201d\u2014and Tolstoy thereupon embraced the life of the\npeasants, and has felt right and happy, or at least relatively so,\never since.(96)\nAs I interpret his melancholy, then, it was not merely an accidental\nvitiation of his humors, though it was doubtless also that. It was\nlogically called for by the clash between his inner character and his\nouter activities and aims. Although a literary artist, Tolstoy was one of\nthose primitive oaks of men to whom the superfluities and insincerities,\nthe cupidities, complications, and cruelties of our polite civilization\nare profoundly unsatisfying, and for whom the eternal veracities lie with\nmore natural and animal things. His crisis was the getting of his soul in\norder, the discovery of its genuine habitat and vocation, the escape from\nfalsehoods into what for him were ways of truth. It was a case of\nheterogeneous personality tardily and slowly finding its unity and level.\nAnd though not many of us can imitate Tolstoy, not having enough, perhaps,\nof the aboriginal human marrow in our bones, most of us may at least feel\nas if it might be better for us if we could.\nBunyan\u2019s recovery seems to have been even slower. For years together he\nwas alternately haunted with texts of Scripture, now up and now down, but\nat last with an ever growing relief in his salvation through the blood of\nChrist.\n\u201cMy peace would be in and out twenty times a day; comfort now and\ntrouble presently; peace now and before I could go a furlong as\nfull of guilt and fear as ever heart could hold.\u201d When a good text\ncomes home to him, \u201cThis,\u201d he writes, \u201cgave me good encouragement\nfor the space of two or three hours\u201d; or \u201cThis was a good day to\nme, I hope I shall not forget it\u201d; or \u201cThe glory of these words\nwas then so weighty on me that I was ready to swoon as I sat; yet\nnot with grief and trouble, but with solid joy and peace\u201d; or\n\u201cThis made a strange seizure on my spirit; it brought light with\nit, and commanded a silence in my heart of all those tumultuous\nthoughts that before did use, like masterless hell\u2010hounds, to roar\nand bellow and make a hideous noise within me. It showed me that\nJesus Christ had not quite forsaken and cast off my Soul.\u201d\nSuch periods accumulate until he can write: \u201cAnd now remained only\nthe hinder part of the tempest, for the thunder was gone beyond\nme, only some drops would still remain, that now and then would\nfall upon me\u201d;\u2014and at last: \u201cNow did my chains fall off my legs\nindeed; I was loosed from my afflictions and irons; my temptations\nalso fled away; so that from that time, those dreadful Scriptures\nof God left off to trouble me; now went I also home rejoicing, for\nthe grace and love of God.... Now could I see myself in Heaven and\nEarth at once; in Heaven by my Christ, by my Head, by my\nRighteousness and Life, though on Earth by my body or person....\nChrist was a precious Christ to my soul that night; I could scarce\nlie in my bed for joy and peace and triumph through Christ.\u201d\nBunyan became a minister of the gospel, and in spite of his neurotic\nconstitution, and of the twelve years he lay in prison for his non\u2010\nconformity, his life was turned to active use. He was a peacemaker and\ndoer of good, and the immortal Allegory which he wrote has brought the\nvery spirit of religious patience home to English hearts.\nBut neither Bunyan nor Tolstoy could become what we have called healthy\u2010\nminded. They had drunk too deeply of the cup of bitterness ever to forget\nits taste, and their redemption is into a universe two stories deep. Each\nof them realized a good which broke the effective edge of his sadness; yet\nthe sadness was preserved as a minor ingredient in the heart of the faith\nby which it was overcome. The fact of interest for us is that as a matter\nof fact they could and did find _something_ welling up in the inner\nreaches of their consciousness, by which such extreme sadness could be\novercome. Tolstoy does well to talk of it as _that by which men live_; for\nthat is exactly what it is, a stimulus, an excitement, a faith, a force\nthat re\u2010infuses the positive willingness to live, even in full presence of\nthe evil perceptions that erewhile made life seem unbearable. For\nTolstoy\u2019s perceptions of evil appear within their sphere to have remained\nunmodified. His later works show him implacable to the whole system of\nofficial values: the ignobility of fashionable life; the infamies of\nempire; the spuriousness of the church, the vain conceit of the\nprofessions; the meannesses and cruelties that go with great success; and\nevery other pompous crime and lying institution of this world. To all\npatience with such things his experience has been for him a permanent\nministry of death.\nBunyan also leaves this world to the enemy.\n\u201cI must first pass a sentence of death,\u201d he says, \u201cupon everything\nthat can properly be called a thing of this life, even to reckon\nmyself, my wife, my children, my health, my enjoyments, and all,\nas dead to me, and myself as dead to them; to trust in God through\nChrist, as touching the world to come; and as touching this world,\nto count the grave my house, to make my bed in darkness, and to\nsay to corruption, Thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou art\nmy mother and sister.... The parting with my wife and my poor\nchildren hath often been to me as the pulling of my flesh from my\nbones, especially my poor blind child who lay nearer my heart than\nall I had besides. Poor child, thought I, what sorrow art thou\nlike to have for thy portion in this world! Thou must be beaten,\nmust beg, suffer hunger, cold, nakedness, and a thousand\ncalamities, though I cannot now endure that the wind should blow\nupon thee. But yet I must venture you all with God, though it\ngoeth to the quick to leave you.\u201d(97)\nThe \u201chue of resolution\u201d is there, but the full flood of ecstatic\nliberation seems never to have poured over poor John Bunyan\u2019s soul.\nThese examples may suffice to acquaint us in a general way with the\nphenomenon technically called \u201cConversion.\u201d In the next lecture I shall\ninvite you to study its peculiarities and concomitants in some detail.\nLECTURE IX. CONVERSION.\nTo be converted, to be regenerated, to receive grace, to experience\nreligion, to gain an assurance, are so many phrases which denote the\nprocess, gradual or sudden, by which a self hitherto divided, and\nconsciously wrong inferior and unhappy, becomes unified and consciously\nright superior and happy, in consequence of its firmer hold upon religious\nrealities. This at least is what conversion signifies in general terms,\nwhether or not we believe that a direct divine operation is needed to\nbring such a moral change about.\nBefore entering upon a minuter study of the process, let me enliven our\nunderstanding of the definition by a concrete example. I choose the quaint\ncase of an unlettered man, Stephen H. Bradley, whose experience is related\nin a scarce American pamphlet.(98)\nI select this case because it shows how in these inner alterations one may\nfind one unsuspected depth below another, as if the possibilities of\ncharacter lay disposed in a series of layers or shells, of whose existence\nwe have no premonitory knowledge.\nBradley thought that he had been already fully converted at the age of\nfourteen.\n\u201cI thought I saw the Saviour, by faith, in human shape, for about\none second in the room, with arms extended, appearing to say to\nme, Come. The next day I rejoiced with trembling; soon after, my\nhappiness was so great that I said that I wanted to die; this\nworld had no place in my affections, as I knew of, and every day\nappeared as solemn to me as the Sabbath. I had an ardent desire\nthat all mankind might feel as I did; I wanted to have them all\nlove God supremely. Previous to this time I was very selfish and\nself\u2010righteous; but now I desired the welfare of all mankind, and\ncould with a feeling heart forgive my worst enemies, and I felt as\nif I should be willing to bear the scoffs and sneers of any\nperson, and suffer anything for His sake, if I could be the means\nin the hands of God, of the conversion of one soul.\u201d\nNine years later, in 1829, Mr. Bradley heard of a revival of\nreligion that had begun in his neighborhood. \u201cMany of the young\nconverts,\u201d he says, \u201cwould come to me when in meeting and ask me\nif I had religion, and my reply generally was, I hope I have. This\ndid not appear to satisfy them; they said they _knew they_ had it.\nI requested them to pray for me, thinking with myself, that if I\nhad not got religion now, after so long a time professing to be a\nChristian, that it was time I had, and hoped their prayers would\nbe answered in my behalf.\n\u201cOne Sabbath, I went to hear the Methodist at the Academy. He\nspoke of the ushering in of the day of general judgment; and he\nset it forth in such a solemn and terrible manner as I never heard\nbefore. The scene of that day appeared to be taking place, and so\nawakened were all the powers of my mind that, like Felix, I\ntrembled involuntarily on the bench where I was sitting, though I\nfelt nothing at heart. The next day evening I went to hear him\nagain. He took his text from Revelation: \u2018And I saw the dead,\nsmall and great, stand before God.\u2019 And he represented the terrors\nof that day in such a manner that it appeared as if it would melt\nthe heart of stone. When he finished his discourse, an old\ngentleman turned to me and said, \u2018This is what I call preaching.\u2019\nI thought the same; but my feelings were still unmoved by what he\nsaid, and I did not enjoy religion, but I believe he did.\n\u201cI will now relate my experience of the power of the Holy Spirit\nwhich took place on the same night. Had any person told me\nprevious to this that I could have experienced the power of the\nHoly Spirit in the manner which I did, I could not have believed\nit, and should have thought the person deluded that told me so. I\nwent directly home after the meeting, and when I got home I\nwondered what made me feel so stupid. I retired to rest soon after\nI got home, and felt indifferent to the things of religion until I\nbegan to be exercised by the Holy Spirit, which began in about\nfive minutes after, in the following manner:\u2014\n\u201cAt first, I began to feel my heart beat very quick all on a\nsudden, which made me at first think that perhaps something is\ngoing to ail me, though I was not alarmed, for I felt no pain. My\nheart increased in its beating, which soon convinced me that it\nwas the Holy Spirit from the effect it had on me. I began to feel\nexceedingly happy and humble, and such a sense of unworthiness as\nI never felt before. I could not very well help speaking out,\nwhich I did, and said, Lord, I do not deserve this happiness, or\nwords to that effect, while there was a stream (resembling air in\nfeeling) came into my mouth and heart in a more sensible manner\nthan that of drinking anything, which continued, as near as I\ncould judge, five minutes or more, which appeared to be the cause\nof such a palpitation of my heart. It took complete possession of\nmy soul, and I am certain that I desired the Lord, while in the\nmidst of it, not to give me any more happiness, for it seemed as\nif I could not contain what I had got. My heart seemed as if it\nwould burst, but it did not stop until I felt as if I was\nunutterably full of the love and grace of God. In the mean time\nwhile thus exercised, a thought arose in my mind, what can it\nmean? and all at once, as if to answer it, my memory became\nexceedingly clear, and it appeared to me just as if the New\nTestament was placed open before me, eighth chapter of Romans, and\nas light as if some candle lighted was held for me to read the\n26th and 27th verses of that chapter, and I read these words: \u2018The\nSpirit helpeth our infirmities with groanings which cannot be\nuttered.\u2019 And all the time that my heart was a\u2010beating, it made me\ngroan like a person in distress, which was not very easy to stop,\nthough I was in no pain at all, and my brother being in bed in\nanother room came and opened the door, and asked me if I had got\nthe toothache. I told him no, and that he might get to sleep. I\ntried to stop. I felt unwilling to go to sleep myself, I was so\nhappy, fearing I should lose it\u2014thinking within myself\n\u2018My willing soul would stay\nIn such a frame as this.\u2019\nAnd while I lay reflecting, after my heart stopped beating,\nfeeling as if my soul was full of the Holy Spirit, I thought that\nperhaps there might be angels hovering round my bed. I felt just\nas if I wanted to converse with them, and finally I spoke, saying,\n\u2018O ye affectionate angels! how is it that ye can take so much\ninterest in our welfare, and we take so little interest in our\nown.\u2019 After this, with difficulty I got to sleep; and when I awoke\nin the morning my first thoughts were: What has become of my\nhappiness? and, feeling a degree of it in my heart, I asked for\nmore, which was given to me as quick as thought. I then got up to\ndress myself, and found to my surprise that I could but just\nstand. It appeared to me as if it was a little heaven upon earth.\nMy soul felt as completely raised above the fears of death as of\ngoing to sleep; and like a bird in a cage, I had a desire, if it\nwas the will of God, to get released from my body and to dwell\nwith Christ, though willing to live to do good to others, and to\nwarn sinners to repent. I went downstairs feeling as solemn as if\nI had lost all my friends, and thinking with myself, that I would\nnot let my parents know it until I had first looked into the\nTestament. I went directly to the shelf and looked into it, at the\neighth chapter of Romans, and every verse seemed to almost speak\nand to confirm it to be truly the Word of God, and as if my\nfeelings corresponded with the meaning of the word. I then told my\nparents of it, and told them that I thought that they must see\nthat when I spoke, that it was not my own voice, for it appeared\nso to me. My speech seemed entirely under the control of the\nSpirit within me; I do not mean that the words which I spoke were\nnot my own, for they were. I thought that I was influenced similar\nto the Apostles on the day of Pentecost (with the exception of\nhaving power to give it to others, and doing what they did). After\nbreakfast I went round to converse with my neighbors on religion,\nwhich I could not have been hired to have done before this, and at\ntheir request I prayed with them, though I had never prayed in\npublic before.\n\u201cI now feel as if I had discharged my duty by telling the truth,\nand hope by the blessing of God, it may do some good to all who\nshall read it. He has fulfilled his promise in sending the Holy\nSpirit down into our hearts, or mine at least, and I now defy all\nthe Deists and Atheists in the world to shake my faith in Christ.\u201d\nSo much for Mr. Bradley and his conversion, of the effect of which upon\nhis later life we gain no information. Now for a minuter survey of the\nconstituent elements of the conversion process.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIf you open the chapter on Association, of any treatise on Psychology, you\nwill read that a man\u2019s ideas, aims, and objects form diverse internal\ngroups and systems, relatively independent of one another. Each \u201caim\u201d\nwhich he follows awakens a certain specific kind of interested excitement,\nand gathers a certain group of ideas together in subordination to it as\nits associates; and if the aims and excitements are distinct in kind,\ntheir groups of ideas may have little in common. When one group is present\nand engrosses the interest, all the ideas connected with other groups may\nbe excluded from the mental field. The President of the United States\nwhen, with paddle, gun, and fishing\u2010rod, he goes camping in the wilderness\nfor a vacation, changes his system of ideas from top to bottom. The\npresidential anxieties have lapsed into the background entirely; the\nofficial habits are replaced by the habits of a son of nature, and those\nwho knew the man only as the strenuous magistrate would not \u201cknow him for\nthe same person\u201d if they saw him as the camper.\nIf now he should never go back, and never again suffer political interests\nto gain dominion over him, he would be for practical intents and purposes\na permanently transformed being. Our ordinary alterations of character, as\nwe pass from one of our aims to another, are not commonly called\ntransformations, because each of them is so rapidly succeeded by another\nin the reverse direction; but whenever one aim grows so stable as to expel\ndefinitively its previous rivals from the individual\u2019s life, we tend to\nspeak of the phenomenon, and perhaps to wonder at it, as a\n\u201ctransformation.\u201d\nThese alternations are the completest of the ways in which a self may be\ndivided. A less complete way is the simultaneous coexistence of two or\nmore different groups of aims, of which one practically holds the right of\nway and instigates activity, whilst the others are only pious wishes, and\nnever practically come to anything. Saint Augustine\u2019s aspirations to a\npurer life, in our last lecture, were for a while an example. Another\nwould be the President in his full pride of office, wondering whether it\nwere not all vanity, and whether the life of a wood\u2010chopper were not the\nwholesomer destiny. Such fleeting aspirations are mere _velleitates_,\nwhimsies. They exist on the remoter outskirts of the mind, and the real\nself of the man, the centre of his energies, is occupied with an entirely\ndifferent system. As life goes on, there is a constant change of our\ninterests, and a consequent change of place in our systems of ideas, from\nmore central to more peripheral, and from more peripheral to more central\nparts of consciousness. I remember, for instance, that one evening when I\nwas a youth, my father read aloud from a Boston newspaper that part of\nLord Gifford\u2019s will which founded these four lectureships. At that time I\ndid not think of being a teacher of philosophy: and what I listened to was\nas remote from my own life as if it related to the planet Mars. Yet here I\nam, with the Gifford system part and parcel of my very self, and all my\nenergies, for the time being, devoted to successfully identifying myself\nwith it. My soul stands now planted in what once was for it a practically\nunreal object, and speaks from it as from its proper habitat and centre.\nWhen I say \u201cSoul,\u201d you need not take me in the ontological sense unless\nyou prefer to; for although ontological language is instinctive in such\nmatters, yet Buddhists or Humians can perfectly well describe the facts in\nthe phenomenal terms which are their favorites. For them the soul is only\na succession of fields of consciousness: yet there is found in each field\na part, or sub\u2010field, which figures as focal and contains the excitement,\nand from which, as from a centre, the aim seems to be taken. Talking of\nthis part, we involuntarily apply words of perspective to distinguish it\nfrom the rest, words like \u201chere,\u201d \u201cthis,\u201d \u201cnow,\u201d \u201cmine,\u201d or \u201cme\u201d; and we\nascribe to the other parts the positions \u201cthere,\u201d \u201cthen,\u201d \u201cthat,\u201d \u201chis\u201d or\n\u201cthine,\u201d \u201cit,\u201d \u201cnot me.\u201d But a \u201chere\u201d can change to a \u201cthere,\u201d and a\n\u201cthere\u201d become a \u201chere,\u201d and what was \u201cmine\u201d and what was \u201cnot mine\u201d\nchange their places.\nWhat brings such changes about is the way in which emotional excitement\nalters. Things hot and vital to us to\u2010day are cold to\u2010morrow. It is as if\nseen from the hot parts of the field that the other parts appear to us,\nand from these hot parts personal desire and volition make their sallies.\nThey are in short the centres of our dynamic energy, whereas the cold\nparts leave us indifferent and passive in proportion to their coldness.\nWhether such language be rigorously exact is for the present of no\nimportance. It is exact enough, if you recognize from your own experience\nthe facts which I seek to designate by it.\nNow there may be great oscillation in the emotional interest, and the hot\nplaces may shift before one almost as rapidly as the sparks that run\nthrough burnt\u2010up paper. Then we have the wavering and divided self we\nheard so much of in the previous lecture. Or the focus of excitement and\nheat, the point of view from which the aim is taken, may come to lie\npermanently within a certain system; and then, if the change be a\nreligious one, we call it a _conversion_, especially if it be by crisis,\nor sudden.\nLet us hereafter, in speaking of the hot place in a man\u2019s consciousness,\nthe group of ideas to which he devotes himself, and from which he works,\ncall it _the habitual centre of his personal energy_. It makes a great\ndifference to a man whether one set of his ideas, or another, be the\ncentre of his energy; and it makes a great difference, as regards any set\nof ideas which he may possess, whether they become central or remain\nperipheral in him. To say that a man is \u201cconverted\u201d means, in these terms,\nthat religious ideas, previously peripheral in his consciousness, now take\na central place, and that religious aims form the habitual centre of his\nenergy.\nNow if you ask of psychology just _how_ the excitement shifts in a man\u2019s\nmental system, and _why_ aims that were peripheral become at a certain\nmoment central, psychology has to reply that although she can give a\ngeneral description of what happens, she is unable in a given case to\naccount accurately for all the single forces at work. Neither an outside\nobserver nor the Subject who undergoes the process can explain fully how\nparticular experiences are able to change one\u2019s centre of energy so\ndecisively, or why they so often have to bide their hour to do so. We have\na thought, or we perform an act, repeatedly, but on a certain day the real\nmeaning of the thought peals through us for the first time, or the act has\nsuddenly turned into a moral impossibility. All we know is that there are\ndead feelings, dead ideas, and cold beliefs, and there are hot and live\nones; and when one grows hot and alive within us, everything has to re\u2010\ncrystallize about it. We may say that the heat and liveliness mean only\nthe \u201cmotor efficacy,\u201d long deferred but now operative, of the idea; but\nsuch talk itself is only circumlocution, for whence the sudden motor\nefficacy? And our explanations then get so vague and general that one\nrealizes all the more the intense individuality of the whole phenomenon.\nIn the end we fall back on the hackneyed symbolism of a mechanical\nequilibrium. A mind is a system of ideas, each with the excitement it\narouses, and with tendencies impulsive and inhibitive, which mutually\ncheck or reinforce one another. The collection of ideas alters by\nsubtraction or by addition in the course of experience, and the tendencies\nalter as the organism gets more aged. A mental system may be undermined or\nweakened by this interstitial alteration just as a building is, and yet\nfor a time keep upright by dead habit. But a new perception, a sudden\nemotional shock, or an occasion which lays bare the organic alteration,\nwill make the whole fabric fall together; and then the centre of gravity\nsinks into an attitude more stable, for the new ideas that reach the\ncentre in the rearrangement seem now to be locked there, and the new\nstructure remains permanent.\nFormed associations of ideas and habits are usually factors of retardation\nin such changes of equilibrium. New information, however acquired, plays\nan accelerating part in the changes; and the slow mutation of our\ninstincts and propensities, under the \u201cunimaginable touch of time\u201d has an\nenormous influence. Moreover, all these influences may work subconsciously\nor half unconsciously.(99) And when you get a Subject in whom the\nsubconscious life\u2014of which I must speak more fully soon\u2014is largely\ndeveloped, and in whom motives habitually ripen in silence, you get a case\nof which you can never give a full account, and in which, both to the\nSubject and the onlookers, there may appear an element of marvel.\nEmotional occasions, especially violent ones, are extremely potent in\nprecipitating mental rearrangements. The sudden and explosive ways in\nwhich love, jealousy, guilt, fear, remorse, or anger can seize upon one\nare known to everybody.(100) Hope, happiness, security, resolve, emotions\ncharacteristic of conversion, can be equally explosive. And emotions that\ncome in this explosive way seldom leave things as they found them.\nIn his recent work on the Psychology of Religion, Professor Starbuck of\nCalifornia has shown by a statistical inquiry how closely parallel in its\nmanifestations the ordinary \u201cconversion\u201d which occurs in young people\nbrought up in evangelical circles is to that growth into a larger\nspiritual life which is a normal phase of adolescence in every class of\nhuman beings. The age is the same, falling usually between fourteen and\nseventeen. The symptoms are the same,\u2014sense of incompleteness and\nimperfection; brooding, depression, morbid introspection, and sense of\nsin; anxiety about the hereafter; distress over doubts, and the like. And\nthe result is the same,\u2014a happy relief and objectivity, as the confidence\nin self gets greater through the adjustment of the faculties to the wider\noutlook. In spontaneous religious awakening, apart from revivalistic\nexamples, and in the ordinary storm and stress and moulting\u2010time of\nadolescence, we also may meet with mystical experiences, astonishing the\nsubjects by their suddenness, just as in revivalistic conversion. The\nanalogy, in fact, is complete; and Starbuck\u2019s conclusion as to these\nordinary youthful conversions would seem to be the only sound one:\nConversion is in its essence a normal adolescent phenomenon, incidental to\nthe passage from the child\u2019s small universe to the wider intellectual and\nspiritual life of maturity.\n\u201cTheology,\u201d says Dr. Starbuck, \u201ctakes the adolescent tendencies and builds\nupon them; it sees that the essential thing in adolescent growth is\nbringing the person out of childhood into the new life of maturity and\npersonal insight. It accordingly brings those means to bear which will\nintensify the normal tendencies. It shortens up the period of duration of\nstorm and stress.\u201d The conversion phenomena of \u201cconviction of sin\u201d last,\nby this investigator\u2019s statistics, about one fifth as long as the periods\nof adolescent storm and stress phenomena of which he also got statistics,\nbut they are very much more intense. Bodily accompaniments, loss of sleep\nand appetite, for example, are much more frequent in them. \u201cThe essential\ndistinction appears to be that conversion intensifies but shortens the\nperiod by bringing the person to a definite crisis.\u201d(101)\nThe conversions which Dr. Starbuck here has in mind are of course mainly\nthose of very commonplace persons, kept true to a pre\u2010appointed type by\ninstruction, appeal, and example. The particular form which they affect is\nthe result of suggestion and imitation.(102) If they went through their\ngrowth\u2010crisis in other faiths and other countries, although the essence of\nthe change would be the same (since it is one in the main so inevitable),\nits accidents would be different. In Catholic lands, for example, and in\nour own Episcopalian sects, no such anxiety and conviction of sin is usual\nas in sects that encourage revivals. The sacraments being more relied on\nin these more strictly ecclesiastical bodies, the individual\u2019s personal\nacceptance of salvation needs less to be accentuated and led up to.\nBut every imitative phenomenon must once have had its original, and I\npropose that for the future we keep as close as may be to the more first\u2010\nhand and original forms of experience. These are more likely to be found\nin sporadic adult cases.\nProfessor Leuba, in a valuable article on the psychology of\nconversion,(103) subordinates the theological aspect of the religious life\nalmost entirely to its moral aspect. The religious sense he defines as\n\u201cthe feeling of un\u2010wholeness, of moral imperfection, of sin, to use the\ntechnical word, accompanied by the yearning after the peace of unity.\u201d\n\u201cThe word \u2018religion,\u2019 \u201d he says, \u201cis getting more and more to signify the\nconglomerate of desires and emotions springing from the sense of sin and\nits release\u201d; and he gives a large number of examples, in which the sin\nranges from drunkenness to spiritual pride, to show that the sense of it\nmay beset one and crave relief as urgently as does the anguish of the\nsickened flesh or any form of physical misery.\nUndoubtedly this conception covers an immense number of cases. A good one\nto use as an example is that of Mr. S. H. Hadley, who after his conversion\nbecame an active and useful rescuer of drunkards in New York. His\nexperience runs as follows:\u2014\n\u201cOne Tuesday evening I sat in a saloon in Harlem, a homeless,\nfriendless, dying drunkard. I had pawned or sold everything that\nwould bring a drink. I could not sleep unless I was dead drunk. I\nhad not eaten for days, and for four nights preceding I had\nsuffered with delirium tremens, or the horrors, from midnight till\nmorning. I had often said, \u2018I will never be a tramp. I will never\nbe cornered, for when that time comes, if ever it comes, I will\nfind a home in the bottom of the river.\u2019 But the Lord so ordered\nit that when that time did come I was not able to walk one quarter\nof the way to the river. As I sat there thinking, I seemed to feel\nsome great and mighty presence. I did not know then what it was. I\ndid learn afterwards that it was Jesus, the sinner\u2019s friend. I\nwalked up to the bar and pounded it with my fist till I made the\nglasses rattle. Those who stood by drinking looked on with\nscornful curiosity. I said I would never take another drink, if I\ndied on the street, and really I felt as though that would happen\nbefore morning. Something said, \u2018If you want to keep this promise,\ngo and have yourself locked up.\u2019 I went to the nearest station\u2010\nhouse and had myself locked up.\n\u201cI was placed in a narrow cell, and it seemed as though all the\ndemons that could find room came in that place with me. This was\nnot all the company I had, either. No, praise the Lord; that dear\nSpirit that came to me in the saloon was present, and said, Pray.\nI did pray, and though I did not feel any great help, I kept on\npraying. As soon as I was able to leave my cell I was taken to the\npolice court and remanded back to the cell. I was finally\nreleased, and found my way to my brother\u2019s house, where every care\nwas given me. While lying in bed the admonishing Spirit never left\nme, and when I arose the following Sabbath morning I felt that day\nwould decide my fate, and toward evening it came into my head to\ngo to Jerry M\u2019Auley\u2019s Mission. I went. The house was packed, and\nwith great difficulty I made my way to the space near the\nplatform. There I saw the apostle to the drunkard and the\noutcast\u2014that man of God, Jerry M\u2019Auley. He rose, and amid deep\nsilence told his experience. There was a sincerity about this man\nthat carried conviction with it, and I found myself saying, \u2018I\nwonder if God can save _me_?\u2019 I listened to the testimony of\ntwenty\u2010five or thirty persons, every one of whom had been saved\nfrom rum, and I made up my mind that I would be saved or die right\nthere. When the invitation was given, I knelt down with a crowd of\ndrunkards. Jerry made the first prayer. Then Mrs. M\u2019Auley prayed\nfervently for us. Oh, what a conflict was going on for my poor\nsoul! A blessed whisper said, \u2018Come\u2019; the devil said, \u2018Be\ncareful.\u2019 I halted but a moment, and then, with a breaking heart,\nI said, \u2018Dear Jesus, can you help me?\u2019 Never with mortal tongue\ncan I describe that moment. Although up to that moment my soul had\nbeen filled with indescribable gloom, I felt the glorious\nbrightness of the noonday sun shine into my heart. I felt I was a\nfree man. Oh, the precious feeling of safety, of freedom, of\nresting on Jesus! I felt that Christ with all his brightness and\npower had come into my life; that, indeed, old things had passed\naway and all things had become new.\n\u201cFrom that moment till now I have never wanted a drink of whiskey,\nand I have never seen money enough to make me take one. I promised\nGod that night that if he would take away the appetite for strong\ndrink, I would work for him all my life. He has done his part, and\nI have been trying to do mine.\u201d(104)\nDr. Leuba rightly remarks that there is little doctrinal theology in such\nan experience, which starts with the absolute need of a higher helper, and\nends with the sense that he has helped us. He gives other cases of\ndrunkards\u2019 conversions which are purely ethical, containing, as recorded,\nno theological beliefs whatever. John B. Gough\u2019s case, for instance, is\npractically, says Dr. Leuba, the conversion of an atheist\u2014neither God nor\nJesus being mentioned.(105) But in spite of the importance of this type of\nregeneration, with little or no intellectual readjustment, this writer\nsurely makes it too exclusive. It corresponds to the subjectively centred\nform of morbid melancholy, of which Bunyan and Alline were examples. But\nwe saw in our seventh lecture that there are objective forms of melancholy\nalso, in which the lack of rational meaning of the universe, and of life\nanyhow, is the burden that weighs upon one\u2014you remember Tolstoy\u2019s\ncase.(106) So there are distinct elements in conversion, and their\nrelations to individual lives deserve to be discriminated.(107)\nSome persons, for instance, never are, and possibly never under any\ncircumstances could be, converted. Religious ideas cannot become the\ncentre of their spiritual energy. They may be excellent persons, servants\nof God in practical ways, but they are not children of his kingdom. They\nare either incapable of imagining the invisible; or else, in the language\nof devotion, they are life\u2010long subjects of \u201cbarrenness\u201d and \u201cdryness.\u201d\nSuch inaptitude for religious faith may in some cases be intellectual in\nits origin. Their religious faculties may be checked in their natural\ntendency to expand, by beliefs about the world that are inhibitive, the\npessimistic and materialistic beliefs, for example, within which so many\ngood souls, who in former times would have freely indulged their religious\npropensities, find themselves nowadays, as it were, frozen; or the\nagnostic vetoes upon faith as something weak and shameful, under which so\nmany of us to\u2010day lie cowering, afraid to use our instincts. In many\npersons such inhibitions are never overcome. To the end of their days they\nrefuse to believe, their personal energy never gets to its religious\ncentre, and the latter remains inactive in perpetuity.\nIn other persons the trouble is profounder. There are men an\u00e6sthetic on\nthe religious side, deficient in that category of sensibility. Just as a\nbloodless organism can never, in spite of all its goodwill, attain to the\nreckless \u201canimal spirits\u201d enjoyed by those of sanguine temperament; so the\nnature which is spiritually barren may admire and envy faith in others,\nbut can never compass the enthusiasm and peace which those who are\ntemperamentally qualified for faith enjoy. All this may, however, turn out\neventually to have been a matter of temporary inhibition. Even late in\nlife some thaw, some release may take place, some bolt be shot back in the\nbarrenest breast, and the man\u2019s hard heart may soften and break into\nreligious feeling. Such cases more than any others suggest the idea that\nsudden conversion is by miracle. So long as they exist, we must not\nimagine ourselves to deal with irretrievably fixed classes.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nNow there are two forms of mental occurrence in human beings, which lead\nto a striking difference in the conversion process, a difference to which\nProfessor Starbuck has called attention. You know how it is when you try\nto recollect a forgotten name. Usually you help the recall by working for\nit, by mentally running over the places, persons, and things with which\nthe word was connected. But sometimes this effort fails: you feel then as\nif the harder you tried the less hope there would be, as though the name\nwere _jammed_, and pressure in its direction only kept it all the more\nfrom rising. And then the opposite expedient often succeeds. Give up the\neffort entirely; think of something altogether different, and in half an\nhour the lost name comes sauntering into your mind, as Emerson says, as\ncarelessly as if it had never been invited. Some hidden process was\nstarted in you by the effort, which went on after the effort ceased, and\nmade the result come as if it came spontaneously. A certain music teacher,\nsays Dr. Starbuck, says to her pupils after the thing to be done has been\nclearly pointed out, and unsuccessfully attempted: \u201cStop trying and it\nwill do itself!\u201d(108)\nThere is thus a conscious and voluntary way and an involuntary and\nunconscious way in which mental results may get accomplished; and we find\nboth ways exemplified in the history of conversion, giving us two types,\nwhich Starbuck calls the _volitional type_ and the _type by self\u2010\nsurrender_ respectively.\nIn the volitional type the regenerative change is usually gradual, and\nconsists in the building up, piece by piece, of a new set of moral and\nspiritual habits. But there are always critical points here at which the\nmovement forward seems much more rapid. This psychological fact is\nabundantly illustrated by Dr. Starbuck. Our education in any practical\naccomplishment proceeds apparently by jerks and starts, just as the growth\nof our physical bodies does.\n\u201cAn athlete ... sometimes awakens suddenly to an understanding of\nthe fine points of the game and to a real enjoyment of it, just as\nthe convert awakens to an appreciation of religion. If he keeps on\nengaging in the sport, there may come a day when all at once the\ngame plays itself through him\u2014when he loses himself in some great\ncontest. In the same way, a musician may suddenly reach a point at\nwhich pleasure in the technique of the art entirely falls away,\nand in some moment of inspiration he becomes the instrument\nthrough which music flows. The writer has chanced to hear two\ndifferent married persons, both of whose wedded lives had been\nbeautiful from the beginning, relate that not until a year or more\nafter marriage did they awake to the full blessedness of married\nlife. So it is with the religious experience of these persons we\nare studying.\u201d(109)\nWe shall erelong hear still more remarkable illustrations of\nsubconsciously maturing processes eventuating in results of which we\nsuddenly grow conscious. Sir William Hamilton and Professor Laycock of\nEdinburgh were among the first to call attention to this class of effects;\nbut Dr. Carpenter first, unless I am mistaken, introduced the term\n\u201cunconscious cerebration,\u201d which has since then been a popular phrase of\nexplanation. The facts are now known to us far more extensively than he\ncould know them, and the adjective \u201cunconscious,\u201d being for many of them\nalmost certainly a misnomer, is better replaced by the vaguer term\n\u201csubconscious\u201d or \u201csubliminal.\u201d\nOf the volitional type of conversion it would be easy to give\nexamples,(110) but they are as a rule less interesting than those of the\nself\u2010surrender type, in which the subconscious effects are more abundant\nand often startling. I will therefore hurry to the latter, the more so\nbecause the difference between the two types is after all not radical.\nEven in the most voluntarily built\u2010up sort of regeneration there are\npassages of partial self\u2010surrender interposed; and in the great majority\nof all cases, when the will has done its uttermost towards bringing one\nclose to the complete unification aspired after, it seems that the very\nlast step must be left to other forces and performed without the help of\nits activity. In other words, self\u2010surrender becomes then indispensable.\n\u201cThe personal will,\u201d says Dr. Starbuck, \u201cmust be given up. In many cases\nrelief persistently refuses to come until the person ceases to resist, or\nto make an effort in the direction he desires to go.\u201d\n\u201cI had said I would not give up; but when my will was broken, it\nwas all over,\u201d writes one of Starbuck\u2019s correspondents.\u2014Another\nsays: \u201cI simply said: \u2018Lord, I have done all I can; I leave the\nwhole matter with Thee;\u2019 and immediately there came to me a great\npeace.\u201d\u2014Another: \u201cAll at once it occurred to me that I might be\nsaved, too, if I would stop trying to do it all myself, and follow\nJesus: somehow I lost my load.\u201d\u2014Another: \u201cI finally ceased to\nresist, and gave myself up, though it was a hard struggle.\nGradually the feeling came over me that I had done my part, and\nGod was willing to do his.\u201d(111)\u2014\u201cLord, Thy will be done; damn or\nsave!\u201d cries John Nelson,(112) exhausted with the anxious struggle\nto escape damnation; and at that moment his soul was filled with\npeace.\nDr. Starbuck gives an interesting, and it seems to me a true, account\u2014so\nfar as conceptions so schematic can claim truth at all\u2014of the reasons why\nself\u2010surrender at the last moment should be so indispensable. To begin\nwith, there are two things in the mind of the candidate for conversion:\nfirst, the present incompleteness or wrongness, the \u201csin\u201d which he is\neager to escape from; and, second, the positive ideal which he longs to\ncompass. Now with most of us the sense of our present wrongness is a far\nmore distinct piece of our consciousness than is the imagination of any\npositive ideal we can aim at. In a majority of cases, indeed, the \u201csin\u201d\nalmost exclusively engrosses the attention, so that conversion is \u201c_a\nprocess of struggling away from sin rather than of striving towards\nrighteousness_.\u201d(113) A man\u2019s conscious wit and will, so far as they\nstrain towards the ideal, are aiming at something only dimly and\ninaccurately imagined. Yet all the while the forces of mere organic\nripening within him are going on towards their own prefigured result, and\nhis conscious strainings are letting loose subconscious allies behind the\nscenes, which in their way work towards rearrangement; and the\nrearrangement towards which all these deeper forces tend is pretty surely\ndefinite, and definitely different from what he consciously conceives and\ndetermines. It may consequently be actually interfered with (_jammed_, as\nit were, like the lost word when we seek too energetically to recall it),\nby his voluntary efforts slanting from the true direction.\nStarbuck seems to put his finger on the root of the matter when he says\nthat to exercise the personal will is still to live in the region where\nthe imperfect self is the thing most emphasized. Where, on the contrary,\nthe subconscious forces take the lead, it is more probably the better self\n_in posse_ which directs the operation. Instead of being clumsily and\nvaguely aimed at from without, it is then itself the organizing centre.\nWhat then must the person do? \u201cHe must relax,\u201d says Dr. Starbuck,\u2014\u201cthat\nis, he must fall back on the larger Power that makes for righteousness,\nwhich has been welling up in his own being, and let it finish in its own\nway the work it has begun.... The act of yielding, in this point of view,\nis giving one\u2019s self over to the new life, making it the centre of a new\npersonality, and living, from within, the truth of it which had before\nbeen viewed objectively.\u201d(114)\n\u201cMan\u2019s extremity is God\u2019s opportunity\u201d is the theological way of putting\nthis fact of the need of self\u2010surrender; whilst the physiological way of\nstating it would be, \u201cLet one do all in one\u2019s power, and one\u2019s nervous\nsystem will do the rest.\u201d Both statements acknowledge the same fact.(115)\nTo state it in terms of our own symbolism: When the new centre of personal\nenergy has been subconsciously incubated so long as to be just ready to\nopen into flower, \u201chands off\u201d is the only word for us, it must burst forth\nunaided!\nWe have used the vague and abstract language of psychology. But since, in\nany terms, the crisis described is the throwing of our conscious selves\nupon the mercy of powers which, whatever they may be, are more ideal than\nwe are actually, and make for our redemption, you see why self\u2010surrender\nhas been and always must be regarded as the vital turning\u2010point of the\nreligious life, so far as the religious life is spiritual and no affair of\nouter works and ritual and sacraments. One may say that the whole\ndevelopment of Christianity in inwardness has consisted in little more\nthan the greater and greater emphasis attached to this crisis of self\u2010\nsurrender. From Catholicism to Lutheranism, and then to Calvinism; from\nthat to Wesleyanism; and from this, outside of technical Christianity\naltogether, to pure \u201cliberalism\u201d or transcendental idealism, whether or\nnot of the mind\u2010cure type, taking in the medi\u00e6val mystics, the quietists,\nthe pietists, and quakers by the way, we can trace the stages of progress\ntowards the idea of an immediate spiritual help, experienced by the\nindividual in his forlornness and standing in no essential need of\ndoctrinal apparatus or propitiatory machinery.\nPsychology and religion are thus in perfect harmony up to this point,\nsince both admit that there are forces seemingly outside of the conscious\nindividual that bring redemption to his life. Nevertheless psychology,\ndefining these forces as \u201csubconscious,\u201d and speaking of their effects as\ndue to \u201cincubation,\u201d or \u201ccerebration,\u201d implies that they do not transcend\nthe individual\u2019s personality; and herein she diverges from Christian\ntheology, which insists that they are direct supernatural operations of\nthe Deity. I propose to you that we do not yet consider this divergence\nfinal, but leave the question for a while in abeyance\u2014continued inquiry\nmay enable us to get rid of some of the apparent discord.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nRevert, then, for a moment more to the psychology of self\u2010surrender.\nWhen you find a man living on the ragged edge of his consciousness, pent\nin to his sin and want and incompleteness, and consequently inconsolable,\nand then simply tell him that all is well with him, that he must stop his\nworry, break with his discontent, and give up his anxiety, you seem to him\nto come with pure absurdities. The only positive consciousness he has\ntells him that all is _not_ well, and the better way you offer sounds\nsimply as if you proposed to him to assert cold\u2010blooded falsehoods. \u201cThe\nwill to believe\u201d cannot be stretched as far as that. We can make ourselves\nmore faithful to a belief of which we have the rudiments, but we cannot\ncreate a belief out of whole cloth when our perception actively assures us\nof its opposite. The better mind proposed to us comes in that case in the\nform of a pure negation of the only mind we have, and we cannot actively\nwill a pure negation.\nThere are only two ways in which it is possible to get rid of anger,\nworry, fear, despair, or other undesirable affections. One is that an\nopposite affection should overpoweringly break over us, and the other is\nby getting so exhausted with the struggle that we have to stop,\u2014so we drop\ndown, give up, and _don\u2019t care_ any longer. Our emotional brain\u2010centres\nstrike work, and we lapse into a temporary apathy. Now there is\ndocumentary proof that this state of temporary exhaustion not infrequently\nforms part of the conversion crisis. So long as the egoistic worry of the\nsick soul guards the door, the expansive confidence of the soul of faith\ngains no presence. But let the former faint away, even but for a moment,\nand the latter can profit by the opportunity, and, having once acquired\npossession, may retain it. Carlyle\u2019s Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh passes from the\neverlasting No to the everlasting Yes through a \u201cCentre of Indifference.\u201d\nLet me give you a good illustration of this feature in the conversion\nprocess. That genuine saint, David Brainerd, describes his own crisis in\nthe following words:\u2014\n\u201cOne morning, while I was walking in a solitary place as usual, I\nat once saw that all my contrivances and projects to effect or\nprocure deliverance and salvation for myself were utterly in vain;\nI was brought quite to a stand, as finding myself totally lost. I\nsaw that it was forever impossible for me to do anything towards\nhelping or delivering myself, that I had made all the pleas I ever\ncould have made to all eternity; and that all my pleas were vain,\nfor I saw that self\u2010interest had led me to pray, and that I had\nnever once prayed from any respect to the glory of God. I saw that\nthere was no necessary connection between my prayers and the\nbestowment of divine mercy; that they laid not the least\nobligation upon God to bestow his grace upon me; and that there\nwas no more virtue or goodness in them than there would be in my\npaddling with my hand in the water. I saw that I had been heaping\nup my devotions before God, fasting, praying, etc., pretending,\nand indeed really thinking sometimes that I was aiming at the\nglory of God; whereas I never once truly intended it, but only my\nown happiness. I saw that as I had never done anything for God, I\nhad no claim on anything from him but perdition, on account of my\nhypocrisy and mockery. When I saw evidently that I had regard to\nnothing but self\u2010interest, then my duties appeared a vile mockery\nand a continual course of lies, for the whole was nothing but\nself\u2010worship, and an horrid abuse of God.\n\u201cI continued, as I remember, in this state of mind, from Friday\nmorning till the Sabbath evening following (July 12, 1739), when I\nwas walking again in the same solitary place. Here, in a mournful\nmelancholy state _I was attempting to pray; but found no heart to\nengage in that or any other duty; my former concern, exercise, and\nreligious affections were now gone. I thought that the Spirit of\nGod had quite left me; but still was not distressed; yet\ndisconsolate, as if there was nothing in heaven or earth could\nmake me happy. Having been thus endeavoring to pray\u2014though, as I\nthought, very stupid and senseless_\u2014for near half an hour; then,\nas I was walking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory seemed to\nopen to the apprehension of my soul. I do not mean any external\nbrightness, nor any imagination of a body of light, but it was a\nnew inward apprehension or view that I had of God, such as I never\nhad before, nor anything which had the least resemblance to it. I\nhad no particular apprehension of any one person in the Trinity,\neither the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost; but it appeared to\nbe Divine glory. My soul rejoiced with joy unspeakable, to see\nsuch a God, such a glorious Divine Being; and I was inwardly\npleased and satisfied that he should be God over all for ever and\never. My soul was so captivated and delighted with the excellency\nof God that I was even swallowed up in him; at least to that\ndegree that I had no thought about my own salvation, and scarce\nreflected that there was such a creature as myself. I continued in\nthis state of inward joy, peace, and astonishing, till near dark\nwithout any sensible abatement; and then began to think and\nexamine what I had seen; and felt sweetly composed in my mind all\nthe evening following. I felt myself in a new world, and\neverything about me appeared with a different aspect from what it\nwas wont to do. At this time, the way of salvation opened to me\nwith such infinite wisdom, suitableness, and excellency, that I\nwondered I should ever think of any other way of salvation; was\namazed that I had not dropped my own contrivances, and complied\nwith this lovely, blessed, and excellent way before. If I could\nhave been saved by my own duties or any other way that I had\nformerly contrived, my whole soul would now have refused it. I\nwondered that all the world did not see and comply with this way\nof salvation, entirely by the righteousness of Christ.\u201d(116)\nI have italicized the passage which records the exhaustion of the anxious\nemotion hitherto habitual. In a large proportion, perhaps the majority, of\nreports, the writers speak as if the exhaustion of the lower and the\nentrance of the higher emotion were simultaneous,(117) yet often again\nthey speak as if the higher actively drove the lower out. This is\nundoubtedly true in a great many instances, as we shall presently see. But\noften there seems little doubt that both conditions\u2014subconscious ripening\nof the one affection and exhaustion of the other\u2014must simultaneously have\nconspired, in order to produce the result.\nT. W. B., a convert of Nettleton\u2019s, being brought to an acute\nparoxysm of conviction of sin, ate nothing all day, locked himself\nin his room in the evening in complete despair, crying aloud, \u201cHow\nlong, O Lord, how long?\u201d \u201cAfter repeating this and similar\nlanguage,\u201d he says, \u201cseveral times, _I seemed to sink away into a\nstate of insensibility_. When I came to myself again I was on my\nknees, praying not for myself but for others. I felt submission to\nthe will of God, willing that he should do with me as should seem\ngood in his sight. My concern seemed all lost in concern for\nothers.\u201d(118)\nOur great American revivalist Finney writes: \u201cI said to myself:\n\u2018What is this? I must have grieved the Holy Ghost entirely away. I\nhave lost all my conviction. I have not a particle of concern\nabout my soul; and it must be that the Spirit has left me.\u2019 \u2018Why!\u2019\nthought I, \u2018I never was so far from being concerned about my own\nsalvation in my life.\u2019... I tried to recall my convictions, to get\nback again the load of sin under which I had been laboring. I\ntried in vain to make myself anxious. I was so quiet and peaceful\nthat I tried to feel concerned about that, lest it should be the\nresult of my having grieved the Spirit away.\u201d(119)\nBut beyond all question there are persons in whom, quite independently of\nany exhaustion in the Subject\u2019s capacity for feeling, or even in the\nabsence of any acute previous feeling, the higher condition, having\nreached the due degree of energy, bursts through all barriers and sweeps\nin like a sudden flood. These are the most striking and memorable cases,\nthe cases of instantaneous conversion to which the conception of divine\ngrace has been most peculiarly attached. I have given one of them at\nlength\u2014the case of Mr. Bradley. But I had better reserve the other cases\nand my comments on the rest of the subject for the following lecture.\nLECTURE X. CONVERSION\u2014CONCLUDED.\nIn this lecture we have to finish the subject of Conversion, considering\nat first those striking instantaneous instances of which Saint Paul\u2019s is\nthe most eminent, and in which, often amid tremendous emotional excitement\nor perturbation of the senses, a complete division is established in the\ntwinkling of an eye between the old life and the new. Conversion of this\ntype is an important phase of religious experience, owing to the part\nwhich it has played in Protestant theology, and it behooves us to study it\nconscientiously on that account.\nI think I had better cite two or three of these cases before proceeding to\na more generalized account. One must know concrete instances first; for,\nas Professor Agassiz used to say, one can see no farther into a\ngeneralization than just so far as one\u2019s previous acquaintance with\nparticulars enables one to take it in. I will go back, then, to the case\nof our friend Henry Alline, and quote his report of the 26th of March,\n1775, on which his poor divided mind became unified for good.\n\u201cAs I was about sunset wandering in the fields lamenting my\nmiserable lost and undone condition, and almost ready to sink\nunder my burden, I thought I was in such a miserable case as never\nany man was before. I returned to the house, and when I got to the\ndoor, just as I was stepping off the threshold, the following\nimpressions came into my mind like a powerful but small still\nvoice. You have been seeking, praying, reforming, laboring,\nreading, hearing, and meditating, and what have you done by it\ntowards your salvation? Are you any nearer to conversion now than\nwhen you first began? Are you any more prepared for heaven, or\nfitter to appear before the impartial bar of God, than when you\nfirst began to seek?\n\u201cIt brought such conviction on me that I was obliged to say that I\ndid not think I was one step nearer than at first, but as much\ncondemned, as much exposed, and as miserable as before. I cried\nout within myself, O Lord God, I am lost, and if thou, O Lord,\ndost not find out some new way, I know nothing of, I shall never\nbe saved, for the ways and methods I have prescribed to myself\nhave all failed me, and I am willing they should fail. O Lord,\nhave mercy! O Lord, have mercy!\n\u201cThese discoveries continued until I went into the house and sat\ndown. After I sat down, being all in confusion, like a drowning\nman that was just giving up to sink, and almost in an agony, I\nturned very suddenly round in my chair, and seeing part of an old\nBible lying in one of the chairs, I caught hold of it in great\nhaste; and opening it without any premeditation, cast my eyes on\nthe 38th Psalm, which was the first time I ever saw the word of\nGod: it took hold of me with such power that it seemed to go\nthrough my whole soul, so that it seemed as if God was praying in,\nwith, and for me. About this time my father called the family to\nattend prayers; I attended, but paid no regard to what he said in\nhis prayer, but continued praying in those words of the Psalm. Oh,\nhelp me, help me! cried I, thou Redeemer of souls, and save me, or\nI am gone forever; thou canst this night, if thou pleasest, with\none drop of thy blood atone for my sins, and appease the wrath of\nan angry God. At that instant of time when I gave all up to him to\ndo with me as he pleased, and was willing that God should rule\nover me at his pleasure, redeeming love broke into my soul with\nrepeated scriptures, with such power that my whole soul seemed to\nbe melted down with love; the burden of guilt and condemnation was\ngone, darkness was expelled, my heart humbled and filled with\ngratitude, and my whole soul, that was a few minutes ago groaning\nunder mountains of death, and crying to an unknown God for help,\nwas now filled with immortal love, soaring on the wings of faith,\nfreed from the chains of death and darkness, and crying out, My\nLord and my God; thou art my rock and my fortress, my shield and\nmy high tower, my life, my joy, my present and my everlasting\nportion. Looking up, I thought I saw that same light [he had on\nmore than one previous occasion seen subjectively a bright blaze\nof light], though it appeared different; and as soon as I saw it,\nthe design was opened to me, according to his promise, and I was\nobliged to cry out: Enough, enough, O blessed God! The work of\nconversion, the change, and the manifestations of it are no more\ndisputable than that light which I see, or anything that ever I\nsaw.\n\u201cIn the midst of all my joys, in less than half an hour after my\nsoul was set at liberty, the Lord discovered to me my labor in the\nministry and call to preach the gospel. I cried out, Amen, Lord,\nI\u2019ll go; send me, send me. I spent the greatest part of the night\nin ecstasies of joy, praising and adoring the Ancient of Days for\nhis free and unbounded grace. After I had been so long in this\ntransport and heavenly frame that my nature seemed to require\nsleep, I thought to close my eyes for a few moments; then the\ndevil stepped in, and told me that if I went to sleep, I should\nlose it all, and when I should awake in the morning I would find\nit to be nothing but a fancy and delusion. I immediately cried\nout, O Lord God, if I am deceived, undeceive me.\n\u201cI then closed my eyes for a few minutes, and seemed to be\nrefreshed with sleep; and when I awoke, the first inquiry was,\nWhere is my God? And in an instant of time, my soul seemed awake\nin and with God, and surrounded by the arms of everlasting love.\nAbout sunrise I arose with joy to relate to my parents what God\nhad done for my soul, and declared to them the miracle of God\u2019s\nunbounded grace. I took a Bible to show them the words that were\nimpressed by God on my soul the evening before; but when I came to\nopen the Bible, it appeared all new to me.\n\u201cI so longed to be useful in the cause of Christ, in preaching the\ngospel, that it seemed as if I could not rest any longer, but go I\nmust and tell the wonders of redeeming love. I lost all taste for\ncarnal pleasures, and carnal company, and was enabled to forsake\nthem.\u201d(120)\nYoung Mr. Alline, after the briefest of delays, and with no book\u2010learning\nbut his Bible, and no teaching save that of his own experience, became a\nChristian minister, and thenceforward his life was fit to rank, for its\nausterity and single\u2010mindedness, with that of the most devoted saints. But\nhappy as he became in his strenuous way, he never got his taste for even\nthe most innocent carnal pleasures back. We must class him, like Bunyan\nand Tolstoy, amongst those upon whose soul the iron of melancholy left a\npermanent imprint. His redemption was into another universe than this mere\nnatural world, and life remained for him a sad and patient trial. Years\nlater we can find him making such an entry as this in his diary: \u201cOn\nWednesday the 12th I preached at a wedding, and had the happiness thereby\nto be the means of excluding carnal mirth.\u201d\nThe next case I will give is that of a correspondent of Professor Leuba,\nprinted in the latter\u2019s article, already cited, in vol. vi. of the\nAmerican Journal of Psychology. This subject was an Oxford graduate, the\nson of a clergyman, and the story resembles in many points the classic\ncase of Colonel Gardiner, which everybody may be supposed to know. Here it\nis, somewhat abridged:\u2014\n\u201cBetween the period of leaving Oxford and my conversion I never\ndarkened the door of my father\u2019s church, although I lived with him\nfor eight years, making what money I wanted by journalism, and\nspending it in high carousal with any one who would sit with me\nand drink it away. So I lived, sometimes drunk for a week\ntogether, and then a terrible repentance, and would not touch a\ndrop for a whole month.\n\u201cIn all this period, that is, up to thirty\u2010three years of age, I\nnever had a desire to reform on religious grounds. But all my\npangs were due to some terrible remorse I used to feel after a\nheavy carousal, the remorse taking the shape of regret after my\nfolly in wasting my life in such a way\u2014a man of superior talents\nand education. This terrible remorse turned me gray in one night,\nand whenever it came upon me I was perceptibly grayer the next\nmorning. What I suffered in this way is beyond the expression of\nwords. It was hell\u2010fire in all its most dreadful tortures. Often\ndid I vow that if I got over \u2018this time\u2019 I would reform. Alas, in\nabout three days I fully recovered, and was as happy as ever. So\nit went on for years, but, with a physique like a rhinoceros, I\nalways recovered, and as long as I let drink alone, no man was as\ncapable of enjoying life as I was.\n\u201cI was converted in my own bedroom in my father\u2019s rectory house at\nprecisely three o\u2019clock in the afternoon of a hot July day (July\n13, 1886). I was in perfect health, having been off from the drink\nfor nearly a month. I was in no way troubled about my soul. In\nfact, God was not in my thoughts that day. A young lady friend\nsent me a copy of Professor Drummond\u2019s Natural Law in the\nSpiritual World, asking me my opinion of it as a literary work\nonly. Being proud of my critical talents and wishing to enhance\nmyself in my new friend\u2019s esteem, I took the book to my bedroom\nfor quiet, intending to give it a thorough study, and then write\nher what I thought of it. It was here that God met me face to\nface, and I shall never forget the meeting. \u2018He that hath the Son\nhath life eternal, he that hath not the Son hath not life.\u2019 I had\nread this scores of times before, but this made all the\ndifference. I was now in God\u2019s presence and my attention was\nabsolutely \u2018soldered\u2019 on to this verse, and I was not allowed to\nproceed with the book till I had fairly considered what these\nwords really involved. Only then was I allowed to proceed, feeling\nall the while that there was another being in my bedroom, though\nnot seen by me. The stillness was very marvelous, and I felt\nsupremely happy. It was most unquestionably shown me, in one\nsecond of time, that I had never touched the Eternal: and that if\nI died then, I must inevitably be lost. I was undone. I knew it as\nwell as I now know I am saved. The Spirit of God showed it me in\nineffable love; there was no terror in it; I felt God\u2019s love so\npowerfully upon me that only a mighty sorrow crept over me that I\nhad lost all through my own folly; and what was I to do? What\ncould I do? I did not repent even; God never asked me to repent.\nAll I felt was \u2018I am undone,\u2019 and God cannot help it, although he\nloves me. No fault on the part of the Almighty. All the time I was\nsupremely happy: I felt like a little child before his father. I\nhad done wrong, but my Father did not scold me, but loved me most\nwondrously. Still my doom was sealed. I was lost to a certainty,\nand being naturally of a brave disposition I did not quail under\nit, but deep sorrow for the past, mixed with regret for what I had\nlost, took hold upon me, and my soul thrilled within me to think\nit was all over. Then there crept in upon me so gently, so\nlovingly, so unmistakably, a way of escape, and what was it after\nall? The old, old story over again, told in the simplest way:\n\u2018There is no name under heaven whereby ye can be saved except that\nof the Lord Jesus Christ.\u2019 No words were spoken to me; my soul\nseemed to see my Saviour in the spirit, and from that hour to\nthis, nearly nine years now, there has never been in my life one\ndoubt that the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father both worked\nupon me that afternoon in July, both differently, and both in the\nmost perfect love conceivable, and I rejoiced there and then in a\nconversion so astounding that the whole village heard of it in\nless than twenty\u2010four hours.\n\u201cBut a time of trouble was yet to come. The day after my\nconversion I went into the hay\u2010field to lend a hand with the\nharvest, and not having made any promise to God to abstain or\ndrink in moderation only, I took too much and came home drunk. My\npoor sister was heart\u2010broken; and I felt ashamed of myself and got\nto my bedroom at once, where she followed me, weeping copiously.\nShe said I had been converted and fallen away instantly. But\nalthough I was quite full of drink (not muddled, however), I knew\nthat God\u2019s work begun in me was not going to be wasted. About\nmidday I made on my knees the first prayer before God for twenty\nyears. I did not ask to be forgiven; I felt that was no good, for\nI would be sure to fall again. Well, what did I do? I committed\nmyself to him in the profoundest belief that my individuality was\ngoing to be destroyed, that he would take all from me, and I was\nwilling. In such a surrender lies the secret of a holy life. From\nthat hour drink has had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never\nwant it. The same thing occurred with my pipe: after being a\nregular smoker from my twelfth year the desire for it went at\nonce, and has never returned. So with every known sin, the\ndeliverance in each case being permanent and complete. I have had\nno temptation since conversion, God seemingly having shut out\nSatan from that course with me. He gets a free hand in other ways,\nbut never on sins of the flesh. Since I gave up to God all\nownership in my own life, he has guided me in a thousand ways, and\nhas opened my path in a way almost incredible to those who do not\nenjoy the blessing of a truly surrendered life.\u201d\nSo much for our graduate of Oxford, in whom you notice the complete\nabolition of an ancient appetite as one of the conversion\u2019s fruits.\nThe most curious record of sudden conversion with which I am acquainted is\nthat of M. Alphonse Ratisbonne, a freethinking French Jew, to Catholicism,\nat Rome in 1842. In a letter to a clerical friend, written a few months\nlater, the convert gives a palpitating account of the circumstances.(121)\nThe predisposing conditions appear to have been slight. He had an elder\nbrother who had been converted and was a Catholic priest. He was himself\nirreligious, and nourished an antipathy to the apostate brother and\ngenerally to his \u201ccloth.\u201d Finding himself at Rome in his twenty\u2010ninth\nyear, he fell in with a French gentleman who tried to make a proselyte of\nhim, but who succeeded no farther after two or three conversations than to\nget him to hang (half jocosely) a religious medal round his neck, and to\naccept and read a copy of a short prayer to the Virgin. M. Ratisbonne\nrepresents his own part in the conversations as having been of a light and\nchaffing order; but he notes the fact that for some days he was unable to\nbanish the words of the prayer from his mind, and that the night before\nthe crisis he had a sort of nightmare, in the imagery of which a black\ncross with no Christ upon it figured. Nevertheless, until noon of the next\nday he was free in mind and spent the time in trivial conversations. I now\ngive his own words.\n\u201cIf at this time any one had accosted me, saying: \u2018Alphonse, in a\nquarter of an hour you shall be adoring Jesus Christ as your God\nand Saviour; you shall lie prostrate with your face upon the\nground in a humble church; you shall be smiting your breast at the\nfoot of a priest; you shall pass the carnival in a college of\nJesuits to prepare yourself to receive baptism, ready to give your\nlife for the Catholic faith; you shall renounce the world and its\npomps and pleasures; renounce your fortune, your hopes, and if\nneed be, your betrothed; the affections of your family, the esteem\nof your friends, and your attachment to the Jewish people; you\nshall have no other aspiration than to follow Christ and bear his\ncross till death;\u2019\u2014if, I say, a prophet had come to me with such a\nprediction, I should have judged that only one person could be\nmore mad than he,\u2014whosoever, namely, might believe in the\npossibility of such senseless folly becoming true. And yet that\nfolly is at present my only wisdom, my sole happiness.\n\u201cComing out of the caf\u00e9 I met the carriage of Monsieur B. [the\nproselyting friend]. He stopped and invited me in for a drive, but\nfirst asked me to wait for a few minutes whilst he attended to\nsome duty at the church of San Andrea delle Fratte. Instead of\nwaiting in the carriage, I entered the church myself to look at\nit. The church of San Andrea was poor, small, and empty; I believe\nthat I found myself there almost alone. No work of art attracted\nmy attention; and I passed my eyes mechanically over its interior\nwithout being arrested by any particular thought. I can only\nremember an entirely black dog which went trotting and turning\nbefore me as I mused. In an instant the dog had disappeared, the\nwhole church had vanished, I no longer saw anything, ... or more\ntruly I saw, O my God, one thing alone.\n\u201cHeavens, how can I speak of it? Oh no! human words cannot attain\nto expressing the inexpressible. Any description, however sublime\nit might be, could be but a profanation of the unspeakable truth.\n\u201cI was there prostrate on the ground, bathed in my tears, with my\nheart beside itself, when M. B. called me back to life. I could\nnot reply to the questions which followed from him one upon the\nother. But finally I took the medal which I had on my breast, and\nwith all the effusion of my soul I kissed the image of the Virgin,\nradiant with grace, which it bore. Oh, indeed, it was She! It was\nindeed She! [What he had seen had been a vision of the Virgin.]\n\u201cI did not know where I was: I did not know whether I was Alphonse\nor another. I only felt myself changed and believed myself another\nme; I looked for myself in myself and did not find myself. In the\nbottom of my soul I felt an explosion of the most ardent joy; I\ncould not speak; I had no wish to reveal what had happened. But I\nfelt something solemn and sacred within me which made me ask for a\npriest. I was led to one; and there, alone, after he had given me\nthe positive order, I spoke as best I could, kneeling, and with my\nheart still trembling. I could give no account to myself of the\ntruth of which I had acquired a knowledge and a faith. All that I\ncan say is that in an instant the bandage had fallen from my eyes;\nand not one bandage only, but the whole manifold of bandages in\nwhich I had been brought up. One after another they rapidly\ndisappeared, even as the mud and ice disappear under the rays of\nthe burning sun.\n\u201cI came out as from a sepulchre, from an abyss of darkness; and I\nwas living, perfectly living. But I wept, for at the bottom of\nthat gulf I saw the extreme of misery from which I had been saved\nby an infinite mercy; and I shuddered at the sight of my\niniquities, stupefied, melted, overwhelmed with wonder and with\ngratitude. You may ask me how I came to this new insight, for\ntruly I had never opened a book of religion nor even read a single\npage of the Bible, and the dogma of original sin is either\nentirely denied or forgotten by the Hebrews of to\u2010day, so that I\nhad thought so little about it that I doubt whether I ever knew\nits name. But how came I, then, to this perception of it? I can\nanswer nothing save this, that on entering that church I was in\ndarkness altogether, and on coming out of it I saw the fullness of\nthe light. I can explain the change no better than by the simile\nof a profound sleep or the analogy of one born blind who should\nsuddenly open his eyes to the day. He sees, but cannot define the\nlight which bathes him and by means of which he sees the objects\nwhich excite his wonder. If we cannot explain physical light, how\ncan we explain the light which is the truth itself? And I think I\nremain within the limits of veracity when I say that without\nhaving any knowledge of the letter of religious doctrine, I now\nintuitively perceived its sense and spirit. Better than if I saw\nthem, I _felt_ those hidden things; I felt them by the\ninexplicable effects they produced in me. It all happened in my\ninterior mind; and those impressions, more rapid than thought,\nshook my soul, revolved and turned it, as it were, in another\ndirection, towards other aims, by other paths. I express myself\nbadly. But do you wish, Lord, that I should inclose in poor and\nbarren words sentiments which the heart alone can understand?\u201d\nI might multiply cases almost indefinitely, but these will suffice to show\nyou how real, definite, and memorable an event a sudden conversion may be\nto him who has the experience. Throughout the height of it he undoubtedly\nseems to himself a passive spectator or undergoer of an astounding process\nperformed upon him from above. There is too much evidence of this for any\ndoubt of it to be possible. Theology, combining this fact with the\ndoctrines of election and grace, has concluded that the spirit of God is\nwith us at these dramatic moments in a peculiarly miraculous way, unlike\nwhat happens at any other juncture of our lives. At that moment, it\nbelieves, an absolutely new nature is breathed into us, and we become\npartakers of the very substance of the Deity.\nThat the conversion should be instantaneous seems called for on this view,\nand the Moravian Protestants appear to have been the first to see this\nlogical consequence. The Methodists soon followed suit, practically if not\ndogmatically, and a short time ere his death, John Wesley wrote:\u2014\n\u201cIn London alone I found 652 members of our Society who were\nexceeding clear in their experience, and whose testimony I could\nsee no reason to doubt. And every one of these (without a single\nexception) has declared that his deliverance from sin was\ninstantaneous; that the change was wrought in a moment. Had half\nof these, or one third, or one in twenty, declared it was\n_gradually_ wrought in _them_, I should have believed this, with\nregard to _them_, and thought that _some_ were gradually\nsanctified and some instantaneously. But as I have not found, in\nso long a space of time, a single person speaking thus, I cannot\nbut believe that sanctification is commonly, if not always, an\ninstantaneous work.\u201d Tyerman\u2019s Life of Wesley, i. 463.\nAll this while the more usual sects of Protestantism have set no such\nstore by instantaneous conversion. For them as for the Catholic Church,\nChrist\u2019s blood, the sacraments, and the individual\u2019s ordinary religious\nduties are practically supposed to suffice to his salvation, even though\nno acute crisis of self\u2010despair and surrender followed by relief should be\nexperienced. For Methodism, on the contrary, unless there have been a\ncrisis of this sort, salvation is only offered, not effectively received,\nand Christ\u2019s sacrifice in so far forth is incomplete. Methodism surely\nhere follows, if not the healthier\u2010minded, yet on the whole the profounder\nspiritual instinct. The individual models which it has set up as typical\nand worthy of imitation are not only the more interesting dramatically,\nbut psychologically they have been the more complete.\nIn the fully evolved Revivalism of Great Britain and America we have, so\nto speak, the codified and stereotyped procedure to which this way of\nthinking has led. In spite of the unquestionable fact that saints of the\nonce\u2010born type exist, that there may be a gradual growth in holiness\nwithout a cataclysm; in spite of the obvious leakage (as one may say) of\nmuch mere natural goodness into the scheme of salvation; revivalism has\nalways assumed that only its own type of religious experience can be\nperfect; you must first be nailed on the cross of natural despair and\nagony, and then in the twinkling of an eye be miraculously released.\nIt is natural that those who personally have traversed such an experience\nshould carry away a feeling of its being a miracle rather than a natural\nprocess. Voices are often heard, lights seen, or visions witnessed;\nautomatic motor phenomena occur; and it always seems, after the surrender\nof the personal will, as if an extraneous higher power had flooded in and\ntaken possession. Moreover the sense of renovation, safety, cleanness,\nrightness, can be so marvelous and jubilant as well to warrant one\u2019s\nbelief in a radically new substantial nature.\n\u201cConversion,\u201d writes the New England Puritan, Joseph Alleine, \u201cis\nnot the putting in a patch of holiness; but with the true convert\nholiness is woven into all his powers, principles, and practice.\nThe sincere Christian is quite a new fabric, from the foundation\nto the top\u2010stone. He is a new man, a new creature.\u201d\nAnd Jonathan Edwards says in the same strain: \u201cThose gracious\ninfluences which are the effects of the Spirit of God are\naltogether supernatural\u2014are quite different from anything that\nunregenerate men experience. They are what no improvement, or\ncomposition of natural qualifications or principles will ever\nproduce; because they not only differ from what is natural, and\nfrom everything that natural men experience in degree and\ncircumstances, but also in kind, and are of a nature far more\nexcellent. From hence it follows that in gracious affections there\nare [also] new perceptions and sensations entirely different in\ntheir nature and kind from anything experienced by the [same]\nsaints before they were sanctified.... The conceptions which the\nsaints have of the loveliness of God, and that kind of delight\nwhich they experience in it, are quite peculiar, and entirely\ndifferent from anything which a natural man can possess, or of\nwhich he can form any proper notion.\u201d\nAnd that such a glorious transformation as this ought of necessity to be\npreceded by despair is shown by Edwards in another passage.\n\u201cSurely it cannot be unreasonable,\u201d he says, \u201cthat before God\ndelivers us from a state of sin and liability to everlasting woe,\nhe should give us some considerable sense of the evil from which\nhe delivers us, in order that we may know and feel the importance\nof salvation, and be enabled to appreciate the value of what God\nis pleased to do for us. As those who are saved are successively\nin two extremely different states\u2014first in a state of condemnation\nand then in a state of justification and blessedness\u2014and as God,\nin the salvation of men, deals with them as rational and\nintelligent creatures, it appears agreeable to this wisdom, that\nthose who are saved should be made sensible of their Being, in\nthose two different states. In the first place, that they should\nbe made sensible of their state of condemnation; and afterwards,\nof their state of deliverance and happiness.\u201d\nSuch quotations express sufficiently well for our purpose the doctrinal\ninterpretation of these changes. Whatever part suggestion and imitation\nmay have played in producing them in men and women in excited assemblies,\nthey have at any rate been in countless individual instances an original\nand unborrowed experience. Were we writing the story of the mind from the\npurely natural\u2010history point of view, with no religious interest whatever,\nwe should still have to write down man\u2019s liability to sudden and complete\nconversion as one of his most curious peculiarities.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWhat, now, must we ourselves think of this question? Is an instantaneous\nconversion a miracle in which God is present as he is present in no change\nof heart less strikingly abrupt? Are there two classes of human beings,\neven among the apparently regenerate, of which the one class really\npartakes of Christ\u2019s nature while the other merely seems to do so? Or, on\nthe contrary, may the whole phenomenon of regeneration, even in these\nstartling instantaneous examples, possibly be a strictly natural process,\ndivine in its fruits, of course, but in one case more and in another less\nso, and neither more nor less divine in its mere causation and mechanism\nthan any other process, high or low, of man\u2019s interior life?\nBefore proceeding to answer this question, I must ask you to listen to\nsome more psychological remarks. At our last lecture, I explained the\nshifting of men\u2019s centres of personal energy within them and the lighting\nup of new crises of emotion. I explained the phenomena as partly due to\nexplicitly conscious processes of thought and will, but as due largely\nalso to the subconscious incubation and maturing of motives deposited by\nthe experiences of life. When ripe, the results hatch out, or burst into\nflower. I have now to speak of the subconscious region, in which such\nprocesses of flowering may occur, in a somewhat less vague way. I only\nregret that my limits of time here force me to be so short.\nThe expression \u201cfield of consciousness\u201d has but recently come into vogue\nin the psychology books. Until quite lately the unit of mental life which\nfigured most was the single \u201cidea\u201d supposed to be a definitely outlined\nthing. But at present psychologists are tending, first, to admit that the\nactual unit is more probably the total mental state, the entire wave of\nconsciousness or field of objects present to the thought at any time; and,\nsecond, to see that it is impossible to outline this wave, this field,\nwith any definiteness.\nAs our mental fields succeed one another, each has its centre of interest,\naround which the objects of which we are less and less attentively\nconscious fade to a margin so faint that its limits are unassignable. Some\nfields are narrow fields and some are wide fields. Usually when we have a\nwide field we rejoice, for we then see masses of truth together, and often\nget glimpses of relations which we divine rather than see, for they shoot\nbeyond the field into still remoter regions of objectivity, regions which\nwe seem rather to be about to perceive than to perceive actually. At other\ntimes, of drowsiness, illness, or fatigue, our fields may narrow almost to\na point, and we find ourselves correspondingly oppressed and contracted.\nDifferent individuals present constitutional differences in this matter of\nwidth of field. Your great organizing geniuses are men with habitually\nvast fields of mental vision, in which a whole programme of future\noperations will appear dotted out at once, the rays shooting far ahead\ninto definite directions of advance. In common people there is never this\nmagnificent inclusive view of a topic. They stumble along, feeling their\nway, as it were, from point to point, and often stop entirely. In certain\ndiseased conditions consciousness is a mere spark, without memory of the\npast or thought of the future, and with the present narrowed down to some\none simple emotion or sensation of the body.\nThe important fact which this \u201cfield\u201d formula commemorates is the\nindetermination of the margin. Inattentively realized as is the matter\nwhich the margin contains, it is nevertheless there, and helps both to\nguide our behavior and to determine the next movement of our attention. It\nlies around us like a \u201cmagnetic field,\u201d inside of which our centre of\nenergy turns like a compass\u2010needle, as the present phase of consciousness\nalters into its successor. Our whole past store of memories floats beyond\nthis margin, ready at a touch to come in; and the entire mass of residual\npowers, impulses, and knowledges that constitute our empirical self\nstretches continuously beyond it. So vaguely drawn are the outlines\nbetween what is actual and what is only potential at any moment of our\nconscious life, that it is always hard to say of certain mental elements\nwhether we are conscious of them or not.\nThe ordinary psychology, admitting fully the difficulty of tracing the\nmarginal outline, has nevertheless taken for granted, first, that all the\nconsciousness the person now has, be the same focal or marginal,\ninattentive or attentive, is there in the \u201cfield\u201d of the moment, all dim\nand impossible to assign as the latter\u2019s outline may be; and, second, that\nwhat is absolutely extra\u2010marginal is absolutely non\u2010existent, and cannot\nbe a fact of consciousness at all.\nAnd having reached this point, I must now ask you to recall what I said in\nmy last lecture about the subconscious life. I said, as you may recollect,\nthat those who first laid stress upon these phenomena could not know the\nfacts as we now know them. My first duty now is to tell you what I meant\nby such a statement.\nI cannot but think that the most important step forward that has occurred\nin psychology since I have been a student of that science is the\ndiscovery, first made in 1886, that, in certain subjects at least, there\nis not only the consciousness of the ordinary field, with its usual centre\nand margin, but an addition thereto in the shape of a set of memories,\nthoughts, and feelings which are extra\u2010marginal and outside of the primary\nconsciousness altogether, but yet must be classed as conscious facts of\nsome sort, able to reveal their presence by unmistakable signs. I call\nthis the most important step forward because, unlike the other advances\nwhich psychology has made, this discovery has revealed to us an entirely\nunsuspected peculiarity in the constitution of human nature. No other step\nforward which psychology has made can proffer any such claim as this.\nIn particular this discovery of a consciousness existing beyond the field,\nor subliminally as Mr. Myers terms it, casts light on many phenomena of\nreligious biography. That is why I have to advert to it now, although it\nis naturally impossible for me in this place to give you any account of\nthe evidence on which the admission of such a consciousness is based. You\nwill find it set forth in many recent books, Binet\u2019s Alterations of\nPersonality(122) being perhaps as good a one as any to recommend.\nThe human material on which the demonstration has been made has so far\nbeen rather limited and, in part at least, eccentric, consisting of\nunusually suggestible hypnotic subjects, and of hysteric patients. Yet the\nelementary mechanisms of our life are presumably so uniform that what is\nshown to be true in a marked degree of some persons is probably true in\nsome degree of all, and may in a few be true in an extraordinarily high\ndegree.\nThe most important consequence of having a strongly developed ultra\u2010\nmarginal life of this sort is that one\u2019s ordinary fields of consciousness\nare liable to incursions from it of which the subject does not guess the\nsource, and which, therefore, take for him the form of unaccountable\nimpulses to act, or inhibitions of action, of obsessive ideas, or even of\nhallucinations of sight or hearing. The impulses may take the direction of\nautomatic speech or writing, the meaning of which the subject himself may\nnot understand even while he utters it; and generalizing this phenomenon,\nMr. Myers has given the name of _automatism_, sensory or motor, emotional\nor intellectual, to this whole sphere of effects, due to \u201cuprushes\u201d into\nthe ordinary consciousness of energies originating in the subliminal parts\nof the mind.\nThe simplest instance of an automatism is the phenomenon of post\u2010hypnotic\nsuggestion, so\u2010called. You give to a hypnotized subject, adequately\nsusceptible, an order to perform some designated act\u2014usual or eccentric,\nit makes no difference\u2014after he wakes from his hypnotic sleep. Punctually,\nwhen the signal comes or the time elapses upon which you have told him\nthat the act must ensue, he performs it;\u2014but in so doing he has no\nrecollection of your suggestion, and he always trumps up an improvised\npretext for his behavior if the act be of an eccentric kind. It may even\nbe suggested to a subject to have a vision or to hear a voice at a certain\ninterval after waking, and when the time comes the vision is seen or the\nvoice heard, with no inkling on the subject\u2019s part of its source. In the\nwonderful explorations by Binet, Janet, Breuer, Freud, Mason, Prince, and\nothers, of the subliminal consciousness of patients with hysteria, we have\nrevealed to us whole systems of underground life, in the shape of memories\nof a painful sort which lead a parasitic existence, buried outside of the\nprimary fields of consciousness, and making irruptions thereinto with\nhallucinations, pains, convulsions, paralyses of feeling and of motion,\nand the whole procession of symptoms of hysteric disease of body and of\nmind. Alter or abolish by suggestion these subconscious memories, and the\npatient immediately gets well. His symptoms were automatisms, in Mr.\nMyers\u2019s sense of the word. These clinical records sound like fairy\u2010tales\nwhen one first reads them, yet it is impossible to doubt their accuracy;\nand, the path having been once opened by these first observers, similar\nobservations have been made elsewhere. They throw, as I said, a wholly new\nlight upon our natural constitution.\nAnd it seems to me that they make a farther step inevitable. Interpreting\nthe unknown after the analogy of the known, it seems to me that hereafter,\nwherever we meet with a phenomenon of automatism, be it motor impulses, or\nobsessive idea, or unaccountable caprice, or delusion, or hallucination,\nwe are bound first of all to make search whether it be not an explosion,\ninto the fields of ordinary consciousness, of ideas elaborated outside of\nthose fields in subliminal regions of the mind. We should look, therefore,\nfor its source in the Subject\u2019s subconscious life. In the hypnotic cases,\nwe ourselves create the source by our suggestion, so we know it directly.\nIn the hysteric cases, the lost memories which are the source have to be\nextracted from the patient\u2019s Subliminal by a number of ingenious methods,\nfor an account of which you must consult the books. In other pathological\ncases, insane delusions, for example, or psychopathic obsessions, the\nsource is yet to seek, but by analogy it also should be in subliminal\nregions which improvements in our methods may yet conceivably put on tap.\nThere lies the mechanism logically to be assumed,\u2014but the assumption\ninvolves a vast program of work to be done in the way of verification, in\nwhich the religious experiences of man must play their part.(123)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nAnd thus I return to our own specific subject of instantaneous\nconversions. You remember the cases of Alline, Bradley, Brainerd, and the\ngraduate of Oxford converted at three in the afternoon. Similar\noccurrences abound, some with and some without luminous visions, all with\na sense of astonished happiness, and of being wrought on by a higher\ncontrol. If, abstracting altogether from the question of their value for\nthe future spiritual life of the individual, we take them on their\npsychological side exclusively, so many peculiarities in them remind us of\nwhat we find outside of conversion that we are tempted to class them along\nwith other automatisms, and to suspect that what makes the difference\nbetween a sudden and a gradual convert is not necessarily the presence of\ndivine miracle in the case of one and of something less divine in that of\nthe other, but rather a simple psychological peculiarity, the fact,\nnamely, that in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we have one\nof those Subjects who are in possession of a large region in which mental\nwork can go on subliminally, and from which invasive experiences, abruptly\nupsetting the equilibrium of the primary consciousness, may come.\nI do not see why Methodists need object to such a view. Pray go back and\nrecollect one of the conclusions to which I sought to lead you in my very\nfirst lecture. You may remember how I there argued against the notion that\nthe worth of a thing can be decided by its origin. Our spiritual judgment,\nI said, our opinion of the significance and value of a human event or\ncondition, must be decided on empirical grounds exclusively. If the\n_fruits for life_ of the state of conversion are good, we ought to\nidealize and venerate it, even though it be a piece of natural psychology;\nif not, we ought to make short work with it, no matter what supernatural\nbeing may have infused it.\nWell, how is it with these fruits? If we except the class of pre\u00ebminent\nsaints of whom the names illumine history, and consider only the usual run\nof \u201csaints,\u201d the shopkeeping church\u2010members and ordinary youthful or\nmiddle\u2010aged recipients of instantaneous conversion, whether at revivals or\nin the spontaneous course of methodistic growth, you will probably agree\nthat no splendor worthy of a wholly supernatural creature fulgurates from\nthem, or sets them apart from the mortals who have never experienced that\nfavor. Were it true that a suddenly converted man as such is, as Edwards\nsays,(124) of an entirely different kind from a natural man, partaking as\nhe does directly of Christ\u2019s substance, there surely ought to be some\nexquisite class\u2010mark, some distinctive radiance attaching even to the\nlowliest specimen of this genus, to which no one of us could remain\ninsensible, and which, so far as it went, would prove him more excellent\nthan ever the most highly gifted among mere natural men. But notoriously\nthere is no such radiance. Converted men as a class are indistinguishable\nfrom natural men; some natural men even excel some converted men in their\nfruits; and no one ignorant of doctrinal theology could guess by mere\nevery\u2010day inspection of the \u201caccidents\u201d of the two groups of persons\nbefore him, that their substance differed as much as divine differs from\nhuman substance.\nThe believers in the non\u2010natural character of sudden conversion have had\npractically to admit that there is no unmistakable class\u2010mark distinctive\nof all true converts. The super\u2010normal incidents, such as voices and\nvisions and overpowering impressions of the meaning of suddenly presented\nscripture texts, the melting emotions and tumultuous affections connected\nwith the crisis of change, may all come by way of nature, or worse still,\nbe counterfeited by Satan. The real witness of the spirit to the second\nbirth is to be found only in the disposition of the genuine child of God,\nthe permanently patient heart, the love of self eradicated. And this, it\nhas to be admitted, is also found in those who pass no crisis, and may\neven be found outside of Christianity altogether.\nThroughout Jonathan Edwards\u2019s admirably rich and delicate description of\nthe supernaturally infused condition, in his Treatise on Religious\nAffections, there is not one decisive trait, not one mark, that\nunmistakably parts it off from what may possibly be only an exceptionally\nhigh degree of natural goodness. In fact, one could hardly read a clearer\nargument than this book unwittingly offers in favor of the thesis that no\nchasm exists between the orders of human excellence, but that here as\nelsewhere, nature shows continuous differences, and generation and\nregeneration are matters of degree.\nAll which denial of two objective classes of human beings separated by a\nchasm must not leave us blind to the extraordinary momentousness of the\nfact of his conversion to the individual himself who gets converted. There\nare higher and lower limits of possibility set to each personal life. If a\nflood but goes above one\u2019s head, its absolute elevation becomes a matter\nof small importance; and when we touch our own upper limit and live in our\nown highest centre of energy, we may call ourselves saved, no matter how\nmuch higher some one else\u2019s centre may be. A small man\u2019s salvation will\nalways be a great salvation and the greatest of all facts _for him_, and\nwe should remember this when the fruits of our ordinary evangelicism look\ndiscouraging. Who knows how much less ideal still the lives of these\nspiritual grubs and earthworms, these Crumps and Stigginses, might have\nbeen, if such poor grace as they have received had never touched them at\nall?(125)\nIf we roughly arrange human beings in classes, each class standing for a\ngrade of spiritual excellence, I believe we shall find natural men and\nconverts both sudden and gradual in all the classes. The forms which\nregenerative change effects have, then, no general spiritual significance,\nbut only a psychological significance. We have seen how Starbuck\u2019s\nlaborious statistical studies tend to assimilate conversion to ordinary\nspiritual growth. Another American psychologist, Prof. George A. Coe,(126)\nhas analyzed the cases of seventy\u2010seven converts or ex\u2010candidates for\nconversion, known to him, and the results strikingly confirm the view that\nsudden conversion is connected with the possession of an active subliminal\nself. Examining his subjects with reference to their hypnotic sensibility\nand to such automatisms as hypnagogic hallucinations, odd impulses,\nreligious dreams about the time of their conversion, etc., he found these\nrelatively much more frequent in the group of converts whose\ntransformation had been \u201cstriking,\u201d \u201cstriking\u201d transformation being\ndefined as a change which, though not necessarily instantaneous, seems to\nthe subject of it to be distinctly different from a process of growth,\nhowever rapid.(127) Candidates for conversion at revivals are, as you\nknow, often disappointed: they experience nothing striking. Professor Coe\nhad a number of persons of this class among his seventy\u2010seven subjects,\nand they almost all, when tested by hypnotism, proved to belong to a\nsubclass which he calls \u201cspontaneous,\u201d that is, fertile in self\u2010\nsuggestions, as distinguished from a \u201cpassive\u201d subclass, to which most of\nthe subjects of striking transformation belonged. His inference is that\nself\u2010suggestion of impossibility had prevented the influence upon these\npersons of an environment which, on the more \u201cpassive\u201d subjects, had\neasily brought forth the effects they looked for. Sharp distinctions are\ndifficult in these regions, and Professor Coe\u2019s numbers are small. But his\nmethods were careful, and the results tally with what one might expect;\nand they seem, on the whole, to justify his practical conclusion, which is\nthat if you should expose to a converting influence a subject in whom\nthree factors unite: first, pronounced emotional sensibility; second,\ntendency to automatisms; and third, suggestibility of the passive type;\nyou might then safely predict the result: there would be a sudden\nconversion, a transformation of the striking kind.\nDoes this temperamental origin diminish the significance of the sudden\nconversion when it has occurred? Not in the least, as Professor Coe well\nsays; for \u201cthe ultimate test of religious values is nothing psychological,\nnothing definable in terms of _how it happens_, but something ethical,\ndefinable only in terms of _what is attained_.\u201d(128)\nAs we proceed farther in our inquiry we shall see that what is attained is\noften an altogether new level of spiritual vitality, a relatively heroic\nlevel, in which impossible things have become possible, and new energies\nand endurances are shown. The personality is changed, the man _is_ born\nanew, whether or not his psychological idiosyncrasies are what give the\nparticular shape to his metamorphosis. \u201cSanctification\u201d is the technical\nname of this result; and erelong examples of it shall be brought before\nyou. In this lecture I have still only to add a few remarks on the\nassurance and peace which fill the hour of change itself.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOne word more, though, before proceeding to that point, lest the final\npurpose of my explanation of suddenness by subliminal activity be\nmisunderstood. I do indeed believe that if the Subject have no liability\nto such subconscious activity, or if his conscious fields have a hard rind\nof a margin that resists incursions from beyond it, his conversion must be\ngradual if it occur, and must resemble any simple growth into new habits.\nHis possession of a developed subliminal self, and of a leaky or pervious\nmargin, is thus a _conditio sine qua non_ of the Subject\u2019s becoming\nconverted in the instantaneous way. But if you, being orthodox Christians,\nask me as a psychologist whether the reference of a phenomenon to a\nsubliminal self does not exclude the notion of the direct presence of the\nDeity altogether, I have to say frankly that as a psychologist I do not\nsee why it necessarily should. The lower manifestations of the Subliminal,\nindeed, fall within the resources of the personal subject: his ordinary\nsense\u2010material, inattentively taken in and subconsciously remembered and\ncombined, will account for all his usual automatisms. But just as our\nprimary wide\u2010awake consciousness throws open our senses to the touch of\nthings material, so it is logically conceivable that _if there be_ higher\nspiritual agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological condition\nof their doing so _might be_ our possession of a subconscious region which\nalone should yield access to them. The hubbub of the waking life might\nclose a door which in the dreamy Subliminal might remain ajar or open.\nThus that perception of external control which is so essential a feature\nin conversion might, in some cases at any rate, be interpreted as the\northodox interpret it: forces transcending the finite individual might\nimpress him, on condition of his being what we may call a subliminal human\nspecimen. But in any case the _value_ of these forces would have to be\ndetermined by their effects, and the mere fact of their transcendency\nwould of itself establish no presumption that they were more divine than\ndiabolical.\nI confess that this is the way in which I should rather see the topic left\nlying in your minds until I come to a much later lecture, when I hope once\nmore to gather these dropped threads together into more definitive\nconclusions. The notion of a subconscious self certainly ought not at this\npoint of our inquiry to be held to _exclude_ all notion of a higher\npenetration. If there be higher powers able to impress us, they may get\naccess to us only through the subliminal door. (See below, p. 515 ff.)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLet us turn now to the feelings which immediately fill the hour of the\nconversion experience. The first one to be noted is just this sense of\nhigher control. It is not always, but it is very often present. We saw\nexamples of it in Alline, Bradley, Brainerd, and elsewhere. The need of\nsuch a higher controlling agency is well expressed in the short reference\nwhich the eminent French Protestant Adolphe Monod makes to the crisis of\nhis own conversion. It was at Naples in his early manhood, in the summer\nof 1827.\n\u201cMy sadness,\u201d he says, \u201cwas without limit, and having got entire\npossession of me, it filled my life from the most indifferent\nexternal acts to the most secret thoughts, and corrupted at their\nsource my feelings, my judgment, and my happiness. It was then\nthat I saw that to expect to put a stop to this disorder by my\nreason and my will, which were themselves diseased, would be to\nact like a blind man who should pretend to correct one of his eyes\nby the aid of the other equally blind one. I had then no resource\nsave in _some influence from without_. I remembered the promise of\nthe Holy Ghost; and what the positive declarations of the Gospel\nhad never succeeded in bringing home to me, I learned at last from\nnecessity, and believed, for the first time in my life, in this\npromise, in the only sense in which it answered the needs of my\nsoul, in that, namely, of a real external supernatural action,\ncapable of giving me thoughts, and taking them away from me, and\nexerted on me by a God as truly master of my heart as he is of the\nrest of nature. Renouncing then all merit, all strength,\nabandoning all my personal resources, and acknowledging no other\ntitle to his mercy than my own utter misery, I went home and threw\nmyself on my knees, and prayed as I never yet prayed in my life.\nFrom this day onwards a new interior life began for me: not that\nmy melancholy had disappeared, but it had lost its sting. Hope had\nentered into my heart, and once entered on the path, the God of\nJesus Christ, to whom I then had learned to give myself up, little\nby little did the rest.\u201d(129)\nIt is needless to remind you once more of the admirable congruity of\nProtestant theology with the structure of the mind as shown in such\nexperiences. In the extreme of melancholy the self that consciously _is_\ncan do absolutely nothing. It is completely bankrupt and without resource,\nand no works it can accomplish will avail. Redemption from such subjective\nconditions must be a free gift or nothing, and grace through Christ\u2019s\naccomplished sacrifice is such a gift.\n\u201cGod,\u201d says Luther, \u201cis the God of the humble, the miserable, the\noppressed, and the desperate, and of those that are brought even\nto nothing; and his nature is to give sight to the blind, to\ncomfort the broken\u2010hearted, to justify sinners, to save the very\ndesperate and damned. Now that pernicious and pestilent opinion of\nman\u2019s own righteousness, which will not be a sinner, unclean,\nmiserable, and damnable, but righteous and holy, suffereth not God\nto come to his own natural and proper work. Therefore God must\ntake this maul in hand (the law, I mean) to beat in pieces and\nbring to nothing this beast with her vain confidence, that she may\nso learn at length by her own misery that she is utterly forlorn\nand damned. But here lieth the difficulty, that when a man is\nterrified and cast down, he is so little able to raise himself up\nagain and say, \u2018Now I am bruised and afflicted enough; now is the\ntime of grace; now is the time to hear Christ.\u2019 The foolishness of\nman\u2019s heart is so great that then he rather seeketh to himself\nmore laws to satisfy his conscience. \u2018If I live,\u2019 saith he, \u2018I\nwill amend my life: I will do this, I will do that.\u2019 But here,\nexcept thou do the quite contrary, except thou send Moses away\nwith his law, and in these terrors and this anguish lay hold upon\nChrist who died for thy sins, look for no salvation. Thy cowl, thy\nshaven crown, thy chastity, thy obedience, thy poverty, thy works,\nthy merits? what shall all these do? what shall the law of Moses\navail? If I, wretched and damnable sinner, through works or merits\ncould have loved the Son of God, and so come to him, what needed\nhe to deliver himself for me? If I, being a wretch and damned\nsinner, could be redeemed by any other price, what needed the Son\nof God to be given? But because there was no other price,\ntherefore he delivered neither sheep, ox, gold, nor silver, but\neven God himself, entirely and wholly \u2018for me,\u2019 even \u2018for me,\u2019 I\nsay, a miserable, wretched sinner. Now, therefore, I take comfort\nand apply this to _myself_. And this manner of applying is the\nvery true force and power of faith. For he died _not_ to justify\nthe righteous, but the _un_\u2010righteous, and to make _them_ the\nchildren of God.\u201d(130)\nThat is, the more literally lost you are, the more literally you are the\nvery being whom Christ\u2019s sacrifice has already saved. Nothing in Catholic\ntheology, I imagine, has ever spoken to sick souls as straight as this\nmessage from Luther\u2019s personal experience. As Protestants are not all sick\nsouls, of course reliance on what Luther exults in calling the dung of\none\u2019s merits, the filthy puddle of one\u2019s own righteousness, has come to\nthe front again in their religion; but the adequacy of his view of\nChristianity to the deeper parts of our human mental structure is shown by\nits wildfire contagiousness when it was a new and quickening thing.\nFaith that Christ has genuinely done his work was part of what Luther\nmeant by faith, which so far is faith in a fact intellectually conceived\nof. But this is only one part of Luther\u2019s faith, the other part being far\nmore vital. This other part is something not intellectual but immediate\nand intuitive, the assurance, namely, that I, this individual I, just as I\nstand, without one plea, etc., am saved now and forever.(131)\nProfessor Leuba is undoubtedly right in contending that the conceptual\nbelief about Christ\u2019s work, although so often efficacious and antecedent,\nis really accessory and non\u2010essential, and that the \u201cjoyous conviction\u201d\ncan also come by far other channels than this conception. It is to the\njoyous conviction itself, the assurance that all is well with one, that he\nwould give the name of faith _par excellence_.\n\u201cWhen the sense of estrangement,\u201d he writes, \u201cfencing man about in\na narrowly limited ego, breaks down, the individual finds himself\n\u2018at one with all creation.\u2019 He lives in the universal life; he and\nman, he and nature, he and God, are one. That state of confidence,\ntrust, union with all things, following upon the achievement of\nmoral unity, is the _Faith\u2010state_. Various dogmatic beliefs\nsuddenly, on the advent of the faith\u2010state, acquire a character of\ncertainty, assume a new reality, become an object of faith. As the\nground of assurance here is not rational, argumentation is\nirrelevant. But such conviction being a mere casual offshoot of\nthe faith\u2010state, it is a gross error to imagine that the chief\npractical value of the faith\u2010state is its power to stamp with the\nseal of reality certain particular theological conceptions.(132)\nOn the contrary, its value lies solely in the fact that it is the\npsychic correlate of a biological growth reducing contending\ndesires to one direction; a growth which expresses itself in new\naffective states and new reactions; in larger, nobler, more\nChrist\u2010like activities. The ground of the specific assurance in\nreligious dogmas is then an affective experience. The objects of\nfaith may even be preposterous; the affective stream will float\nthem along, and invest them with unshakable certitude. The more\nstartling the affective experience, the less explicable it seems,\nthe easier it is to make it the carrier of unsubstantiated\nnotions.\u201d(133)\nThe characteristics of the affective experience which, to avoid ambiguity,\nshould, I think, be called the state of assurance rather than the faith\u2010\nstate, can be easily enumerated, though it is probably difficult to\nrealize their intensity, unless one have been through the experience one\u2019s\nself.\nThe central one is the loss of all the worry, the sense that all is\nultimately well with one, the peace, the harmony, the _willingness to be_,\neven though the outer conditions should remain the same. The certainty of\nGod\u2019s \u201cgrace,\u201d of \u201cjustification,\u201d \u201csalvation,\u201d is an objective belief\nthat usually accompanies the change in Christians; but this may be\nentirely lacking and yet the affective peace remain the same\u2014you will\nrecollect the case of the Oxford graduate: and many might be given where\nthe assurance of personal salvation was only a later result. A passion of\nwillingness, of acquiescence, of admiration, is the glowing centre of this\nstate of mind.\nThe second feature is the sense of perceiving truths not known before. The\nmysteries of life become lucid, as Professor Leuba says; and often, nay\nusually, the solution is more or less unutterable in words. But these more\nintellectual phenomena may be postponed until we treat of mysticism.\nA third peculiarity of the assurance state is the objective change which\nthe world often appears to undergo. \u201cAn appearance of newness beautifies\nevery object,\u201d the precise opposite of that other sort of newness, that\ndreadful unreality and strangeness in the appearance of the world, which\nis experienced by melancholy patients, and of which you may recall my\nrelating some examples.(134) This sense of clean and beautiful newness\nwithin and without is one of the commonest entries in conversion records.\nJonathan Edwards thus describes it in himself:\u2014\n\u201cAfter this my sense of divine things gradually increased, and\nbecame more and more lively, and had more of that inward\nsweetness. The appearance of everything was altered; there seemed\nto be, as it were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine\nglory, in almost everything. God\u2019s excellency, his wisdom, his\npurity and love, seemed to appear in everything; in the sun, moon,\nand stars; in the clouds and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, and\ntrees; in the water and all nature; which used greatly to fix my\nmind. And scarce anything, among all the works of nature, was so\nsweet to me as thunder and lightning; formerly nothing had been so\nterrible to me. Before, I used to be uncommonly terrified with\nthunder, and to be struck with terror when I saw a thunderstorm\nrising; but now, on the contrary, it rejoices me.\u201d(135)\nBilly Bray, an excellent little illiterate English evangelist, records his\nsense of newness thus:\u2014\n\u201cI said to the Lord: \u2018Thou hast said, they that ask shall receive,\nthey that seek shall find, and to them that knock the door shall\nbe opened, and I have faith to believe it.\u2019 In an instant the Lord\nmade me so happy that I cannot express what I felt. I shouted for\njoy. I praised God with my whole heart.... I think this was in\nNovember, 1823, but what day of the month I do not know. I\nremember this, that everything looked new to me, the people, the\nfields, the cattle, the trees. I was like a new man in a new\nworld. I spent the greater part of my time in praising the\nLord.\u201d(136)\nStarbuck and Leuba both illustrate this sense of newness by quotations. I\ntake the two following from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection. One, a\nwoman, says:\u2014\n\u201cI was taken to a camp\u2010meeting, mother and religious friends\nseeking and praying for my conversion. My emotional nature was\nstirred to its depths; confessions of depravity and pleading with\nGod for salvation from sin made me oblivious of all surroundings.\nI plead for mercy, and had a vivid realization of forgiveness and\nrenewal of my nature. When rising from my knees I exclaimed, \u2018Old\nthings have passed away, all things have become new.\u2019 It was like\nentering another world, a new state of existence. Natural objects\nwere glorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw\nbeauty in every material object in the universe, the woods were\nvocal with heavenly music; my soul exulted in the love of God, and\nI wanted everybody to share in my joy.\u201d\nThe next case is that of a man:\u2014\n\u201cI know not how I got back into the encampment, but found myself\nstaggering up to Rev. \u2014\u2014\u2019s Holiness tent\u2014and as it was full of\nseekers and a terrible noise inside, some groaning, some laughing,\nand some shouting, and by a large oak, ten feet from the tent, I\nfell on my face by a bench, and tried to pray, and every time I\nwould call on God, something like a man\u2019s hand would strangle me\nby choking. I don\u2019t know whether there were any one around or near\nme or not. I thought I should surely die if I did not get help,\nbut just as often as I would pray, that unseen hand was felt on my\nthroat and my breath squeezed off. Finally something said:\n\u2018Venture on the atonement, for you will die anyway if you don\u2019t.\u2019\nSo I made one final struggle to call on God for mercy, with the\nsame choking and strangling, determined to finish the sentence of\nprayer for Mercy, if I did strangle and die, and the last I\nremember that time was falling back on the ground with the same\nunseen hand on my throat. I don\u2019t know how long I lay there or\nwhat was going on. None of my folks were present. When I came to\nmyself, there were a crowd around me praising God. The very\nheavens seemed to open and pour down rays of light and glory. Not\nfor a moment only, but all day and night, floods of light and\nglory seemed to pour through my soul, and oh, how I was changed,\nand everything became new. My horses and hogs and even everybody\nseemed changed.\u201d\nThis man\u2019s case introduces the feature of automatisms, which in\nsuggestible subjects have been so startling a feature at revivals since,\nin Edwards\u2019s, Wesley\u2019s, and Whitfield\u2019s time, these became a regular means\nof gospel propagation. They were at first supposed to be semi\u2010miraculous\nproofs of \u201cpower\u201d on the part of the Holy Ghost; but great divergence of\nopinion quickly arose concerning them. Edwards, in his Thoughts on the\nRevival of Religion in New England, has to defend them against their\ncritics; and their value has long been matter of debate even within the\nrevivalistic denominations.(137) They undoubtedly have no essential\nspiritual significance, and although their presence makes his conversion\nmore memorable to the convert, it has never been proved that converts who\nshow them are more persevering or fertile in good fruits than those whose\nchange of heart has had less violent accompaniments. On the whole,\nunconsciousness, convulsions, visions, involuntary vocal utterances, and\nsuffocation, must be simply ascribed to the subject\u2019s having a large\nsubliminal region, involving nervous instability. This is often the\nsubject\u2019s own view of the matter afterwards. One of Starbuck\u2019s\ncorrespondents writes, for instance:\u2014\n\u201cI have been through the experience which is known as conversion.\nMy explanation of it is this: the subject works his emotions up to\nthe breaking point, at the same time resisting their physical\nmanifestations, such as quickened pulse, etc., and then suddenly\nlets them have their full sway over his body. The relief is\nsomething wonderful, and the pleasurable effects of the emotions\nare experienced to the highest degree.\u201d\nThere is one form of sensory automatism which possibly deserves special\nnotice on account of its frequency. I refer to hallucinatory or pseudo\u2010\nhallucinatory luminous phenomena, _photisms_, to use the term of the\npsychologists. Saint Paul\u2019s blinding heavenly vision seems to have been a\nphenomenon of this sort; so does Constantine\u2019s cross in the sky. The last\ncase but one which I quoted mentions floods of light and glory. Henry\nAlline mentions a light, about whose externality he seems uncertain.\nColonel Gardiner sees a blazing light. President Finney writes:\u2014\n\u201cAll at once the glory of God shone upon and round about me in a\nmanner almost marvelous.... A light perfectly ineffable shone in\nmy soul, that almost prostrated me on the ground.... This light\nseemed like the brightness of the sun in every direction. It was\ntoo intense for the eyes.... I think I knew something then, by\nactual experience, of that light that prostrated Paul on the way\nto Damascus. It was surely a light such as I could not have\nendured long.\u201d(138)\nSuch reports of photisms are indeed far from uncommon. Here is another\nfrom Starbuck\u2019s collection, where the light appeared evidently external:\u2014\n\u201cI had attended a series of revival services for about two weeks\noff and on. Had been invited to the altar several times, all the\ntime becoming more deeply impressed, when finally I decided I must\ndo this, or I should be lost. Realization of conversion was very\nvivid, like a ton\u2019s weight being lifted from my heart; a strange\nlight which seemed to light up the whole room (for it was dark); a\nconscious supreme bliss which caused me to repeat \u2018Glory to God\u2019\nfor a long time. Decided to be God\u2019s child for life, and to give\nup my pet ambition, wealth and social position. My former habits\nof life hindered my growth somewhat, but I set about overcoming\nthese systematically, and in one year my whole nature was changed,\ni.e., my ambitions were of a different order.\u201d\nHere is another one of Starbuck\u2019s cases, involving a luminous element:\u2014\n\u201cI had been clearly converted twenty\u2010three years before, or rather\nreclaimed. My experience in regeneration was then clear and\nspiritual, and I had not backslidden. But I experienced entire\nsanctification on the 15th day of March, 1893, about eleven\no\u2019clock in the morning. The particular accompaniments of the\nexperience were entirely unexpected. I was quietly sitting at home\nsinging selections out of Pentecostal Hymns. Suddenly there seemed\nto be a something sweeping into me and inflating my entire\nbeing\u2014such a sensation as I had never experienced before. When\nthis experience came, I seemed to be conducted around a large,\ncapacious, well\u2010lighted room. As I walked with my invisible\nconductor and looked around, a clear thought was coined in my\nmind, \u2018They are not here, they are gone.\u2019 As soon as the thought\nwas definitely formed in my mind, though no word was spoken, the\nHoly Spirit impressed me that I was surveying my own soul. Then,\nfor the first time in all my life, did I know that I was cleansed\nfrom all sin, and filled with the fullness of God.\u201d\nLeuba quotes the case of a Mr. Peek, where the luminous affection reminds\none of the chromatic hallucinations produced by the intoxicant cactus buds\ncalled mescal by the Mexicans:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I went in the morning into the fields to work, the glory of\nGod appeared in all his visible creation. I well remember we\nreaped oats, and how every straw and head of the oats seemed, as\nit were, arrayed in a kind of rainbow glory, or to glow, if I may\nso express it, in the glory of God.\u201d(139)\nThe most characteristic of all the elements of the conversion crisis, and\nthe last one of which I shall speak, is the ecstasy of happiness produced.\nWe have already heard several accounts of it, but I will add a couple\nmore. President Finney\u2019s is so vivid that I give it at length:\u2014\n\u201cAll my feelings seemed to rise and flow out; and the utterance of\nmy heart was, \u2018I want to pour my whole soul out to God.\u2019 The\nrising of my soul was so great that I rushed into the back room of\nthe front office, to pray. There was no fire and no light in the\nroom; nevertheless it appeared to me as if it were perfectly\nlight. As I went in and shut the door after me, it seemed as if I\nmet the Lord Jesus Christ face to face. It did not occur to me\nthen, nor did it for some time afterwards, that it was wholly a\nmental state. On the contrary, it seemed to me that I saw him as I\nwould see any other man. He said nothing, but looked at me in such\na manner as to break me right down at his feet. I have always\nsince regarded this as a most remarkable state of mind; for it\nseemed to me a reality that he stood before me, and I fell down at\nhis feet and poured out my soul to him. I wept aloud like a child,\nand made such confessions as I could with my choked utterance. It\nseemed to me that I bathed his feet with my tears; and yet I had\nno distinct impression that I touched him, that I recollect. I\nmust have continued in this state for a good while; but my mind\nwas too much absorbed with the interview to recollect anything\nthat I said. But I know, as soon as my mind became calm enough to\nbreak off from the interview, I returned to the front office, and\nfound that the fire that I had made of large wood was nearly\nburned out. But as I turned and was about to take a seat by the\nfire, I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. Without any\nexpectation of it, without ever having the thought in my mind that\nthere was any such thing for me, without any recollection that I\nhad ever heard the thing mentioned by any person in the world, the\nHoly Spirit descended upon me in a manner that seemed to go\nthrough me, body and soul. I could feel the impression, like a\nwave of electricity, going through and through me. Indeed, it\nseemed to come in waves and waves of liquid love; for I could not\nexpress it in any other way. It seemed like the very breath of\nGod. I can recollect distinctly that it seemed to fan me, like\nimmense wings.\n\u201cNo words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in\nmy heart. I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do not know but I\nshould say I literally bellowed out the unutterable gushings of my\nheart. These waves came over me, and over me, and over me, one\nafter the other, until I recollect I cried out, \u2018I shall die if\nthese waves continue to pass over me.\u2019 I said, \u2018Lord, I cannot\nbear any more;\u2019 yet I had no fear of death.\n\u201cHow long I continued in this state, with this baptism continuing\nto roll over me and go through me, I do not know. But I know it\nwas late in the evening when a member of my choir\u2014for I was the\nleader of the choir\u2014came into the office to see me. He was a\nmember of the church. He found me in this state of loud weeping,\nand said to me, \u2018Mr. Finney, what ails you?\u2019 I could make him no\nanswer for some time. He then said, \u2018Are you in pain?\u2019 I gathered\nmyself up as best I could, and replied, \u2018No, but so happy that I\ncannot live.\u2019 \u201d\nI just now quoted Billy Bray; I cannot do better than give his own brief\naccount of his post\u2010conversion feelings:\u2014\n\u201cI can\u2019t help praising the Lord. As I go along the street, I lift\nup one foot, and it seems to say \u2018Glory\u2019; and I lift up the other,\nand it seems to say \u2018Amen\u2019; and so they keep up like that all the\ntime I am walking.\u201d(140)\nOne word, before I close this lecture, on the question of the transiency\nor permanence of these abrupt conversions. Some of you, I feel sure,\nknowing that numerous backslidings and relapses take place, make of these\ntheir apperceiving mass for interpreting the whole subject, and dismiss it\nwith a pitying smile at so much \u201chysterics.\u201d Psychologically, as well as\nreligiously, however, this is shallow. It misses the point of serious\ninterest, which is not so much the duration as the nature and quality of\nthese shiftings of character to higher levels. Men lapse from every\nlevel\u2014we need no statistics to tell us that. Love is, for instance, well\nknown not to be irrevocable, yet, constant or inconstant, it reveals new\nflights and reaches of ideality while it lasts. These revelations form its\nsignificance to men and women, whatever be its duration. So with the\nconversion experience: that it should for even a short time show a human\nbeing what the high\u2010water mark of his spiritual capacity is, this is what\nconstitutes its importance,\u2014an importance which backsliding cannot\ndiminish, although persistence might increase it. As a matter of fact, all\nthe more striking instances of conversion, all those, for instance, which\nI have quoted, _have_ been permanent. The case of which there might be\nmost doubt, on account of its suggesting so strongly an epileptoid\nseizure, was the case of M. Ratisbonne. Yet I am informed that\nRatisbonne\u2019s whole future was shaped by those few minutes. He gave up his\nproject of marriage, became a priest, founded at Jerusalem, where he went\nto dwell, a mission of nuns for the conversion of the Jews, showed no\ntendency to use for egotistic purposes the notoriety given him by the\npeculiar circumstances of his conversion,\u2014which, for the rest, he could\nseldom refer to without tears,\u2014and in short remained an exemplary son of\nthe Church until he died, late in the 80\u2019s, if I remember rightly.\nThe only statistics I know of, on the subject of the duration of\nconversions, are those collected for Professor Starbuck by Miss Johnston.\nThey embrace only a hundred persons, evangelical church\u2010members, more than\nhalf being Methodists. According to the statement of the subjects\nthemselves, there had been backsliding of some sort in nearly all the\ncases, 93 per cent. of the women, 77 per cent. of the men. Discussing the\nreturns more minutely, Starbuck finds that only 6 per cent. are relapses\nfrom the religious faith which the conversion confirmed, and that the\nbacksliding complained of is in most only a fluctuation in the ardor of\nsentiment. Only six of the hundred cases report a change of faith.\nStarbuck\u2019s conclusion is that the effect of conversion is to bring with it\n\u201ca changed attitude towards life, which is fairly constant and permanent,\nalthough the feelings fluctuate.... In other words, the persons who have\npassed through conversion, having once taken a stand for the religious\nlife, tend to feel themselves identified with it, no matter how much their\nreligious enthusiasm declines.\u201d(141)\nLECTURES XI, XII, AND XIII. SAINTLINESS.\nThe last lecture left us in a state of expectancy. What may the practical\nfruits for life have been, of such movingly happy conversions as those we\nheard of? With this question the really important part of our task opens,\nfor you remember that we began all this empirical inquiry not merely to\nopen a curious chapter in the natural history of human consciousness, but\nrather to attain a spiritual judgment as to the total value and positive\nmeaning of all the religious trouble and happiness which we have seen. We\nmust, therefore, first describe the fruits of the religious life, and then\nwe must judge them. This divides our inquiry into two distinct parts. Let\nus without further preamble proceed to the descriptive task.\nIt ought to be the pleasantest portion of our business in these lectures.\nSome small pieces of it, it is true, may be painful, or may show human\nnature in a pathetic light, but it will be mainly pleasant, because the\nbest fruits of religious experience are the best things that history has\nto show. They have always been esteemed so; here if anywhere is the\ngenuinely strenuous life; and to call to mind a succession of such\nexamples as I have lately had to wander through, though it has been only\nin the reading of them, is to feel encouraged and uplifted and washed in\nbetter moral air.\nThe highest flights of charity, devotion, trust, patience, bravery to\nwhich the wings of human nature have spread themselves have been flown for\nreligious ideals. I can do no better than quote, as to this, some remarks\nwhich Sainte\u2010Beuve in his History of Port\u2010Royal makes on the results of\nconversion or the state of grace.\n\u201cEven from the purely human point of view,\u201d Sainte\u2010Beuve says, \u201cthe\nphenomenon of grace must still appear sufficiently extraordinary, eminent,\nand rare, both in its nature and in its effects, to deserve a closer\nstudy. For the soul arrives thereby at a certain fixed and invincible\nstate, a state which is genuinely heroic, and from out of which the\ngreatest deeds which it ever performs are executed. Through all the\ndifferent forms of communion, and all the diversity of the means which\nhelp to produce this state, whether it be reached by a jubilee, by a\ngeneral confession, by a solitary prayer and effusion, whatever in short\nbe the place and the occasion, it is easy to recognize that it is\nfundamentally one state in spirit and in fruits. Penetrate a little\nbeneath the diversity of circumstances, and it becomes evident that in\nChristians of different epochs it is always one and the same modification\nby which they are affected: there is veritably a single fundamental and\nidentical spirit of piety and charity, common to those who have received\ngrace; an inner state which before all things is one of love and humility,\nof infinite confidence in God, and of severity for one\u2019s self, accompanied\nwith tenderness for others. The fruits peculiar to this condition of the\nsoul have the same savor in all, under distant suns and in different\nsurroundings, in Saint Teresa of Avila just as in any Moravian brother of\nHerrnhut.\u201d(142)\nSainte\u2010Beuve has here only the more eminent instances of regeneration in\nmind, and these are of course the instructive ones for us also to\nconsider. These devotees have often laid their course so differently from\nother men that, judging them by worldly law, we might be tempted to call\nthem monstrous aberrations from the path of nature. I begin, therefore, by\nasking a general psychological question as to what the inner conditions\nare which may make one human character differ so extremely from another.\nI reply at once that where the character, as something distinguished from\nthe intellect, is concerned, the causes of human diversity lie chiefly in\nour _differing susceptibilities of emotional excitement_, and in the\n_different impulses and inhibitions_ which these bring in their train. Let\nme make this more clear.\nSpeaking generally, our moral and practical attitude, at any given time,\nis always a resultant of two sets of forces within us, impulses pushing us\none way and obstructions and inhibitions holding us back. \u201cYes! yes!\u201d say\nthe impulses; \u201cNo! no!\u201d say the inhibitions. Few people who have not\nexpressly reflected on the matter realize how constantly this factor of\ninhibition is upon us, how it contains and moulds us by its restrictive\npressure almost as if we were fluids pent within the cavity of a jar. The\ninfluence is so incessant that it becomes subconscious. All of you, for\nexample, sit here with a certain constraint at this moment, and entirely\nwithout express consciousness of the fact, because of the influence of the\noccasion. If left alone in the room, each of you would probably\ninvoluntarily rearrange himself, and make his attitude more \u201cfree and\neasy.\u201d But proprieties and their inhibitions snap like cobwebs if any\ngreat emotional excitement supervenes. I have seen a dandy appear in the\nstreet with his face covered with shaving\u2010lather because a house across\nthe way was on fire; and a woman will run among strangers in her nightgown\nif it be a question of saving her baby\u2019s life or her own. Take a self\u2010\nindulgent woman\u2019s life in general. She will yield to every inhibition set\nby her disagreeable sensations, lie late in bed, live upon tea or\nbromides, keep indoors from the cold. Every difficulty finds her obedient\nto its \u201cno.\u201d But make a mother of her, and what have you? Possessed by\nmaternal excitement, she now confronts wakefulness, weariness, and toil\nwithout an instant of hesitation or a word of complaint. The inhibitive\npower of pain over her is extinguished wherever the baby\u2019s interests are\nat stake. The inconveniences which this creature occasions have become, as\nJames Hinton says, the glowing heart of a great joy, and indeed are now\nthe very conditions whereby the joy becomes most deep.\nThis is an example of what you have already heard of as the \u201cexpulsive\npower of a higher affection.\u201d But be the affection high or low, it makes\nno difference, so long as the excitement it brings be strong enough. In\none of Henry Drummond\u2019s discourses he tells of an inundation in India\nwhere an eminence with a bungalow upon it remained unsubmerged, and became\nthe refuge of a number of wild animals and reptiles in addition to the\nhuman beings who were there. At a certain moment a royal Bengal tiger\nappeared swimming towards it, reached it, and lay panting like a dog upon\nthe ground in the midst of the people, still possessed by such an agony of\nterror that one of the Englishmen could calmly step up with a rifle and\nblow out its brains. The tiger\u2019s habitual ferocity was temporarily quelled\nby the emotion of fear, which became sovereign, and formed a new centre\nfor his character.\nSometimes no emotional state is sovereign, but many contrary ones are\nmixed together. In that case one hears both \u201cyeses\u201d and \u201cnoes,\u201d and the\n\u201cwill\u201d is called on then to solve the conflict. Take a soldier, for\nexample, with his dread of cowardice impelling him to advance, his fears\nimpelling him to run, and his propensities to imitation pushing him\ntowards various courses if his comrades offer various examples. His person\nbecomes the seat of a mass of interferences; and he may for a time simply\nwaver, because no one emotion prevails. There is a pitch of intensity,\nthough, which, if any emotion reach it, enthrones that one as alone\neffective and sweeps its antagonists and all their inhibitions away. The\nfury of his comrades\u2019 charge, once entered on, will give this pitch of\ncourage to the soldier; the panic of their rout will give this pitch of\nfear. In these sovereign excitements, things ordinarily impossible grow\nnatural because the inhibitions are annulled. Their \u201cno! no!\u201d not only is\nnot heard, it does not exist. Obstacles are then like tissue\u2010paper hoops\nto the circus rider\u2014no impediment; the flood is higher than the dam they\nmake. \u201cLass sie betteln gehn wenn sie hungrig sind!\u201d cries the grenadier,\nfrantic over his Emperor\u2019s capture, when his wife and babes are suggested;\nand men pent into a burning theatre have been known to cut their way\nthrough the crowd with knives.(143)\nOne mode of emotional excitability is exceedingly important in the\ncomposition of the energetic character, from its peculiarly destructive\npower over inhibitions. I mean what in its lower form is mere\nirascibility, susceptibility to wrath, the fighting temper; and what in\nsubtler ways manifests itself as impatience, grimness, earnestness,\nseverity of character. Earnestness means willingness to live with energy,\nthough energy bring pain. The pain may be pain to other people or pain to\none\u2019s self\u2014it makes little difference; for when the strenuous mood is on\none, the aim is to break something, no matter whose or what. Nothing\nannihilates an inhibition as irresistibly as anger does it; for, as Moltke\nsays of war, destruction pure and simple is its essence. This is what\nmakes it so invaluable an ally of every other passion. The sweetest\ndelights are trampled on with a ferocious pleasure the moment they offer\nthemselves as checks to a cause by which our higher indignations are\nelicited. It costs then nothing to drop friendships, to renounce long\u2010\nrooted privileges and possessions, to break with social ties. Rather do we\ntake a stern joy in the astringency and desolation; and what is called\nweakness of character seems in most cases to consist in the inaptitude for\nthese sacrificial moods, of which one\u2019s own inferior self and its pet\nsoftnesses must often be the targets and the victims.(144)\nSo far I have spoken of temporary alterations produced by shifting\nexcitements in the same person. But the relatively fixed differences of\ncharacter of different persons are explained in a precisely similar way.\nIn a man with a liability to a special sort of emotion, whole ranges of\ninhibition habitually vanish, which in other men remain effective, and\nother sorts of inhibition take their place. When a person has an inborn\ngenius for certain emotions, his life differs strangely from that of\nordinary people, for none of their usual deterrents check him. Your mere\naspirant to a type of character, on the contrary, only shows, when your\nnatural lover, fighter, or reformer, with whom the passion is a gift of\nnature, comes along, the hopeless inferiority of voluntary to instinctive\naction. He has deliberately to overcome his inhibitions; the genius with\nthe inborn passion seems not to feel them at all; he is free of all that\ninner friction and nervous waste. To a Fox, a Garibaldi, a General Booth,\na John Brown, a Louise Michel, a Bradlaugh, the obstacles omnipotent over\nthose around them are as if non\u2010existent. Could the rest of us so\ndisregard them, there might be many such heroes, for many have the wish to\nlive for similar ideals, and only the adequate degree of inhibition\u2010\nquenching fury is lacking.(145)\nThe difference between willing and merely wishing, between having ideals\nthat are creative and ideals that are but pinings and regrets, thus\ndepends solely either on the amount of steam\u2010pressure chronically driving\nthe character in the ideal direction, or on the amount of ideal excitement\ntransiently acquired. Given a certain amount of love, indignation,\ngenerosity, magnanimity, admiration, loyalty, or enthusiasm of self\u2010\nsurrender, the result is always the same. That whole raft of cowardly\nobstructions, which in tame persons and dull moods are sovereign\nimpediments to action, sinks away at once. Our conventionality,(146) our\nshyness, laziness, and stinginess, our demands for precedent and\npermission, for guarantee and surety, our small suspicions, timidities,\ndespairs, where are they now? Severed like cobwebs, broken like bubbles in\nthe sun\u2014\n\u201cWo sind die Sorge nun und Noth\nDie mich noch gestern wollt\u2019 erschlaffen?\nIch sch\u00e4m\u2019 mich dess\u2019 im Morgenroth.\u201d\nThe flood we are borne on rolls them so lightly under that their very\ncontact is unfelt. Set free of them, we float and soar and sing. This\nauroral openness and uplift gives to all creative ideal levels a bright\nand caroling quality, which is nowhere more marked than where the\ncontrolling emotion is religious. \u201cThe true monk,\u201d writes an Italian\nmystic, \u201ctakes nothing with him but his lyre.\u201d\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWe may now turn from these psychological generalities to those fruits of\nthe religious state which form the special subject of our present lecture.\nThe man who lives in his religious centre of personal energy, and is\nactuated by spiritual enthusiasms, differs from his previous carnal self\nin perfectly definite ways. The new ardor which burns in his breast\nconsumes in its glow the lower \u201cnoes\u201d which formerly beset him, and keeps\nhim immune against infection from the entire groveling portion of his\nnature. Magnanimities once impossible are now easy; paltry\nconventionalities and mean incentives once tyrannical hold no sway. The\nstone wall inside of him has fallen, the hardness in his heart has broken\ndown. The rest of us can, I think, imagine this by recalling our state of\nfeeling in those temporary \u201cmelting moods\u201d into which either the trials of\nreal life, or the theatre, or a novel sometimes throw us. Especially if we\nweep! For it is then as if our tears broke through an inveterate inner\ndam, and let all sorts of ancient peccancies and moral stagnancies drain\naway, leaving us now washed and soft of heart and open to every nobler\nleading. With most of us the customary hardness quickly returns, but not\nso with saintly persons. Many saints, even as energetic ones as Teresa and\nLoyola, have possessed what the church traditionally reveres as a special\ngrace, the so\u2010called gift of tears. In these persons the melting mood\nseems to have held almost uninterrupted control. And as it is with tears\nand melting moods, so it is with other exalted affections. Their reign may\ncome by gradual growth or by a crisis; but in either case it may have\n\u201ccome to stay.\u201d\nAt the end of the last lecture we saw this permanence to be true of the\ngeneral paramountcy of the higher insight, even though in the ebbs of\nemotional excitement meaner motives might temporarily prevail and\nbacksliding might occur. But that lower temptations may remain completely\nannulled, apart from transient emotion and as if by alteration of the\nman\u2019s habitual nature, is also proved by documentary evidence in certain\ncases. Before embarking on the general natural history of the regenerate\ncharacter, let me convince you of this curious fact by one or two\nexamples. The most numerous are those of reformed drunkards. You recollect\nthe case of Mr. Hadley in the last lecture; the Jerry McAuley Water Street\nMission abounds in similar instances.(147) You also remember the graduate\nof Oxford, converted at three in the afternoon, and getting drunk in the\nhay\u2010field the next day, but after that permanently cured of his appetite.\n\u201cFrom that hour drink has had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never\nwant it. The same thing occurred with my pipe, ... the desire for it went\nat once and has never returned. So with every known sin, the deliverance\nin each case being permanent and complete. I have had no temptations since\nconversion.\u201d\nHere is an analogous case from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection:\u2014\n\u201cI went into the old Adelphi Theatre, where there was a Holiness\nmeeting, ... and I began saying, \u2018Lord, Lord, I must have this\nblessing.\u2019 Then what was to me an audible voice said: \u2018Are you\nwilling to give up everything to the Lord?\u2019 and question after\nquestion kept coming up, to all of which I said: \u2018Yes, Lord; yes,\nLord!\u2019 until this came: \u2018Why do you not accept it _now_?\u2019 and I\nsaid: \u2018I do, Lord.\u2019\u2014I felt no particular joy, only a trust. Just\nthen the meeting closed, and, as I went out on the street, I met a\ngentleman smoking a fine cigar, and a cloud of smoke came into my\nface, and I took a long, deep breath of it, and praise the Lord,\nall my appetite for it was gone. Then as I walked along the\nstreet, passing saloons where the fumes of liquor came out, I\nfound that all my taste and longing for that accursed stuff was\ngone. Glory to God! ... [But] for ten or eleven long years [after\nthat] I was in the wilderness with its ups and downs. My appetite\nfor liquor never came back.\u201d\nThe classic case of Colonel Gardiner is that of a man cured of sexual\ntemptation in a single hour. To Mr. Spears the colonel said, \u201cI was\neffectually cured of all inclination to that sin I was so strongly\naddicted to that I thought nothing but shooting me through the head could\nhave cured me of it; and all desire and inclination to it was removed, as\nentirely as if I had been a sucking child; nor did the temptation return\nto this day.\u201d Mr. Webster\u2019s words on the same subject are these: \u201cOne\nthing I have heard the colonel frequently say, that he was much addicted\nto impurity before his acquaintance with religion; but that, so soon as he\nwas enlightened from above, he felt the power of the Holy Ghost changing\nhis nature so wonderfully that his sanctification in this respect seemed\nmore remarkable than in any other.\u201d(148)\nSuch rapid abolition of ancient impulses and propensities reminds us so\nstrongly of what has been observed as the result of hypnotic suggestion\nthat it is difficult not to believe that subliminal influences play the\ndecisive part in these abrupt changes of heart, just as they do in\nhypnotism.(149) Suggestive therapeutics abound in records of cure, after a\nfew sittings, of inveterate bad habits with which the patient, left to\nordinary moral and physical influences, had struggled in vain. Both\ndrunkenness and sexual vice have been cured in this way, action through\nthe subliminal seeming thus in many individuals to have the prerogative of\ninducing relatively stable change. If the grace of God miraculously\noperates, it probably operates through the subliminal door, then. But just\n_how_ anything operates in this region is still unexplained, and we shall\ndo well now to say good\u2010by to the _process_ of transformation\naltogether,\u2014leaving it, if you like, a good deal of a psychological or\ntheological mystery,\u2014and to turn our attention to the fruits of the\nreligious condition, no matter in what way they may have been\nproduced.(150)\nThe collective name for the ripe fruits of religion in a character is\nSaintliness.(151) The saintly character is the character for which\nspiritual emotions are the habitual centre of the personal energy; and\nthere is a certain composite photograph of universal saintliness, the same\nin all religions, of which the features can easily be traced.(152)\nThey are these:\u2014\n1. A feeling of being in a wider life than that of this world\u2019s selfish\nlittle interests; and a conviction, not merely intellectual, but as it\nwere sensible, of the existence of an Ideal Power. In Christian\nsaintliness this power is always personified as God; but abstract moral\nideals, civic or patriotic utopias, or inner visions of holiness or right\nmay also be felt as the true lords and enlargers of our life, in ways\nwhich I described in the lecture on the Reality of the Unseen.(153)\n2. A sense of the friendly continuity of the ideal power with our own\nlife, and a willing self\u2010surrender to its control.\n3. An immense elation and freedom, as the outlines of the confining\nselfhood melt down.\n4. A shifting of the emotional centre towards loving and harmonious\naffections, towards \u201cyes, yes\u201d and away from \u201cno,\u201d where the claims of the\nnon\u2010ego are concerned.\nThese fundamental inner conditions have characteristic practical\nconsequences, as follows:\u2014\n_a._ _Asceticism._\u2014The self\u2010surrender may become so passionate as to turn\ninto self\u2010immolation. It may then so overrule the ordinary inhibitions of\nthe flesh that the saint finds positive pleasure in sacrifice and\nasceticism, measuring and expressing as they do the degree of his loyalty\nto the higher power.\n_b._ _Strength of Soul._\u2014The sense of enlargement of life may be so\nuplifting that personal motives and inhibitions, commonly omnipotent,\nbecome too insignificant for notice, and new reaches of patience and\nfortitude open out. Fears and anxieties go, and blissful equanimity takes\ntheir place. Come heaven, come hell, it makes no difference now!\n\u201cWe forbid ourselves all seeking after popularity, all ambition to\nappear important. We pledge ourselves to abstain from falsehood,\nin all its degrees. We promise not to create or encourage\nillusions as to what is possible, by what we say or write. We\npromise to one another active sincerity, which strives to see\ntruth clearly, and which never fears to declare what it sees.\n\u201cWe promise deliberate resistance to the tidal waves of fashion,\nto the \u2018booms\u2019 and panics of the public mind, to all the forms of\nweakness and of fear.\n\u201cWe forbid ourselves the use of sarcasm. Of serious things we will\nspeak seriously and unsmilingly, without banter and without the\nappearance of banter;\u2014and even so of all things, for there are\nserious ways of being light of heart.\n\u201cWe will put ourselves forward always for what we are, simply and\nwithout false humility, as well as without pedantry, affectation,\nor pride.\u201d\n_c._ _Purity._\u2014The shifting of the emotional centre brings with it, first,\nincrease of purity. The sensitiveness to spiritual discords is enhanced,\nand the cleansing of existence from brutal and sensual elements becomes\nimperative. Occasions of contact with such elements are avoided: the\nsaintly life must deepen its spiritual consistency and keep unspotted from\nthe world. In some temperaments this need of purity of spirit takes an\nascetic turn, and weaknesses of the flesh are treated with relentless\nseverity.\n_d._ _Charity._\u2014The shifting of the emotional centre brings, secondly,\nincrease of charity, tenderness for fellow\u2010creatures. The ordinary motives\nto antipathy, which usually set such close bounds to tenderness among\nhuman beings, are inhibited. The saint loves his enemies, and treats\nloathsome beggars as his brothers.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI now have to give some concrete illustrations of these fruits of the\nspiritual tree. The only difficulty is to choose, for they are so\nabundant.\nSince the sense of Presence of a higher and friendly Power seems to be the\nfundamental feature in the spiritual life, I will begin with that.\nIn our narratives of conversion we saw how the world might look shining\nand transfigured to the convert,(154) and, apart from anything acutely\nreligious, we all have moments when the universal life seems to wrap us\nround with friendliness. In youth and health, in summer, in the woods or\non the mountains, there come days when the weather seems all whispering\nwith peace, hours when the goodness and beauty of existence enfold us like\na dry warm climate, or chime through us as if our inner ears were subtly\nringing with the world\u2019s security. Thoreau writes:\u2014\n\u201cOnce, a few weeks after I came to the woods, for an hour I\ndoubted whether the near neighborhood of man was not essential to\na serene and healthy life. To be alone was somewhat unpleasant.\nBut, in the midst of a gentle rain, while these thoughts\nprevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent\nsociety in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in\nevery sight and sound around my house, an infinite and\nunaccountable friendliness all at once, like an atmosphere,\nsustaining me, as made the fancied advantages of human\nneighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them\nsince. Every little pine\u2010needle expanded and swelled with sympathy\nand befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware of the presence\nof something kindred to me, that I thought no place could ever be\nstrange to me again.\u201d(155)\nIn the Christian consciousness this sense of the enveloping friendliness\nbecomes most personal and definite. \u201cThe compensation,\u201d writes a German\nauthor, \u201cfor the loss of that sense of personal independence which man so\nunwillingly gives up, is the disappearance of all _fear_ from one\u2019s life,\nthe quite indescribable and inexplicable feeling of an inner _security_,\nwhich one can only experience, but which, once it has been experienced,\none can never forget.\u201d(156)\nI find an excellent description of this state of mind in a sermon by Mr.\nVoysey:\u2014\n\u201cIt is the experience of myriads of trustful souls, that this\nsense of God\u2019s unfailing presence with them in their going out and\nin their coming in, and by night and day, is a source of absolute\nrepose and confident calmness. It drives away all fear of what may\nbefall them. That nearness of God is a constant security against\nterror and anxiety. It is not that they are at all assured of\nphysical safety, or deem themselves protected by a love which is\ndenied to others, but that they are in a state of mind equally\nready to be safe or to meet with injury. If injury befall them,\nthey will be content to bear it because the Lord is their keeper,\nand nothing can befall them without his will. If it be his will,\nthen injury is for them a blessing and no calamity at all. Thus\nand thus only is the trustful man protected and shielded from\nharm. And I for one\u2014by no means a thick\u2010skinned or hard\u2010nerved\nman\u2014am absolutely satisfied with this arrangement, and do not wish\nfor any other kind of immunity from danger and catastrophe. Quite\nas sensitive to pain as the most highly strung organism, I yet\nfeel that the worst of it is conquered, and the sting taken out of\nit altogether, by the thought that God is our loving and sleepless\nkeeper, and that nothing can hurt us without his will.\u201d(157)\nMore excited expressions of this condition are abundant in religious\nliterature. I could easily weary you with their monotony. Here is an\naccount from Mrs. Jonathan Edwards:\u2014\n\u201cLast night,\u201d Mrs. Edwards writes, \u201cwas the sweetest night I ever\nhad in my life. I never before, for so long a time together,\nenjoyed so much of the light and rest and sweetness of heaven in\nmy soul, but without the least agitation of body during the whole\ntime. Part of the night I lay awake, sometimes asleep, and\nsometimes between sleeping and waking. But all night I continued\nin a constant, clear, and lively sense of the heavenly sweetness\nof Christ\u2019s excellent love, of his nearness to me, and of my\ndearness to him; with an inexpressibly sweet calmness of soul in\nan entire rest in him. I seemed to myself to perceive a glow of\ndivine love come down from the heart of Christ in heaven into my\nheart in a constant stream, like a stream or pencil of sweet\nlight. At the same time my heart and soul all flowed out in love\nto Christ, so that there seemed to be a constant flowing and\nreflowing of heavenly love, and I appeared to myself to float or\nswim, in these bright, sweet beams, like the motes swimming in the\nbeams of the sun, or the streams of his light which come in at the\nwindow. I think that what I felt each minute was worth more than\nall the outward comfort and pleasure which I had enjoyed in my\nwhole life put together. It was pleasure, without the least sting,\nor any interruption. It was a sweetness, which my soul was lost\nin; it seemed to be all that my feeble frame could sustain. There\nwas but little difference, whether I was asleep or awake, but if\nthere was any difference, the sweetness was greatest while I was\nasleep.(158) As I awoke early the next morning, it seemed to me\nthat I had entirely done with myself. I felt that the opinions of\nthe world concerning me were nothing, and that I had no more to do\nwith any outward interest of my own than with that of a person\nwhom I never saw. The glory of God seemed to swallow up every wish\nand desire of my heart.... After retiring to rest and sleeping a\nlittle while, I awoke, and was led to reflect on God\u2019s mercy to\nme, in giving me, for many years, a willingness to die; and after\nthat, in making me willing to live, that I might do and suffer\nwhatever he called me to here. I also thought how God had\ngraciously given me an entire resignation to his will, with\nrespect to the kind and manner of death that I should die; having\nbeen made willing to die on the rack, or at the stake, and if it\nwere God\u2019s will, to die in darkness. But now it occurred to me, I\nused to think of living no longer than to the ordinary age of man.\nUpon this I was led to ask myself, whether I was not willing to be\nkept out of heaven even longer; and my whole heart seemed\nimmediately to reply: Yes, a thousand years, and a thousand in\nhorror, if it be most for the honor of God, the torment of my body\nbeing so great, awful, and overwhelming that none could bear to\nlive in the country where the spectacle was seen, and the torment\nof my mind being vastly greater. And it seemed to me that I found\na perfect willingness, quietness, and alacrity of soul in\nconsenting that it should be so, if it were most for the glory of\nGod, so that there was no hesitation, doubt, or darkness in my\nmind. The glory of God seemed to overcome me and swallow me up,\nand every conceivable suffering, and everything that was terrible\nto my nature, seemed to shrink to nothing before it. This\nresignation continued in its clearness and brightness the rest of\nthe night, and all the next day, and the night following, and on\nMonday in the forenoon, without interruption or abatement.\u201d(159)\nThe annals of Catholic saintship abound in records as ecstatic or more\necstatic than this. \u201cOften the assaults of the divine love,\u201d it is said of\nthe Sister S\u00e9raphique de la Martini\u00e8re, \u201creduced her almost to the point\nof death. She used tenderly to complain of this to God. \u2018I cannot support\nit,\u2019 she used to say. \u2018Bear gently with my weakness, or I shall expire\nunder the violence of your love.\u2019 \u201d(160)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLet me pass next to the Charity and Brotherly Love which are a usual fruit\nof saintliness, and have always been reckoned essential theological\nvirtues, however limited may have been the kinds of service which the\nparticular theology enjoined. Brotherly love would follow logically from\nthe assurance of God\u2019s friendly presence, the notion of our brotherhood as\nmen being an immediate inference from that of God\u2019s fatherhood of us all.\nWhen Christ utters the precepts: \u201cLove your enemies, bless them that curse\nyou, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully\nuse you, and persecute you,\u201d he gives for a reason: \u201cThat ye may be the\nchildren of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise\non the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the\nunjust.\u201d One might therefore be tempted to explain both the humility as to\none\u2019s self and the charity towards others which characterize spiritual\nexcitement, as results of the all\u2010leveling character of theistic belief.\nBut these affections are certainly not mere derivatives of theism. We find\nthem in Stoicism, in Hinduism, and in Buddhism in the highest possible\ndegree. They harmonize with paternal theism beautifully; but they\n_harmonize_ with all reflection whatever upon the dependence of mankind on\ngeneral causes; and we must, I think, consider them not subordinate but\nco\u00f6rdinate parts of that great complex excitement in the study of which we\nare engaged. Religious rapture, moral enthusiasm, ontological wonder,\ncosmic emotion, are all unifying states of mind, in which the sand and\ngrit of the selfhood incline to disappear, and tenderness to rule. The\nbest thing is to describe the condition integrally as a characteristic\naffection to which our nature is liable, a region in which we find\nourselves at home, a sea in which we swim; but not to pretend to explain\nits parts by deriving them too cleverly from one another. Like love or\nfear, the faith\u2010state is a natural psychic complex, and carries charity\nwith it by organic consequence. Jubilation is an expansive affection, and\nall expansive affections are self\u2010forgetful and kindly so long as they\nendure.\nWe find this the case even when they are pathological in origin. In his\ninstructive work, la Tristesse et la Joie,(161) M. Georges Dumas compares\ntogether the melancholy and the joyous phase of circular insanity, and\nshows that, while selfishness characterizes the one, the other is marked\nby altruistic impulses. No human being so stingy and useless as was Marie\nin her melancholy period! But the moment the happy period begins,\n\u201csympathy and kindness become her characteristic sentiments. She displays\na universal goodwill, not only of intention, but in act.... She becomes\nsolicitous of the health of other patients, interested in getting them\nout, desirous to procure wool to knit socks for some of them. Never since\nshe has been under my observation have I heard her in her joyous period\nutter any but charitable opinions.\u201d(162) And later, Dr. Dumas says of all\nsuch joyous conditions that \u201cunselfish sentiments and tender emotions are\nthe only affective states to be found in them. The subject\u2019s mind is\nclosed against envy, hatred, and vindictiveness, and wholly transformed\ninto benevolence, indulgence, and mercy.\u201d(163)\nThere is thus an organic affinity between joyousness and tenderness, and\ntheir companionship in the saintly life need in no way occasion surprise.\nAlong with the happiness, this increase of tenderness is often noted in\nnarratives of conversion. \u201cI began to work for others\u201d;\u2014\u201cI had more tender\nfeeling for my family and friends\u201d;\u2014\u201cI spoke at once to a person with whom\nI had been angry\u201d;\u2014\u201cI felt for every one, and loved my friends better\u201d;\u2014\u201cI\nfelt every one to be my friend\u201d;\u2014these are so many expressions from the\nrecords collected by Professor Starbuck.(164)\n\u201cWhen,\u201d says Mrs. Edwards, continuing the narrative from which I\nmade quotation a moment ago, \u201cI arose on the morning of the\nSabbath, I felt a love to all mankind, wholly peculiar in its\nstrength and sweetness, far beyond all that I had ever felt\nbefore. The power of that love seemed inexpressible. I thought, if\nI were surrounded by enemies, who were venting their malice and\ncruelty upon me, in tormenting me, it would still be impossible\nthat I should cherish any feelings towards them but those of love,\nand pity, and ardent desires for their happiness. I never before\nfelt so far from a disposition to judge and censure others, as I\ndid that morning. I realized also, in an unusual and very lively\nmanner, how great a part of Christianity lies in the performance\nof our social and relative duties to one another. The same joyful\nsense continued throughout the day\u2014a sweet love to God and all\nmankind.\u201d\nWhatever be the explanation of the charity, it may efface all usual human\nbarriers.(165)\nHere, for instance, is an example of Christian non\u2010resistance from Richard\nWeaver\u2019s autobiography. Weaver was a collier, a semi\u2010professional pugilist\nin his younger days, who became a much beloved evangelist. Fighting, after\ndrinking, seems to have been the sin to which he originally felt his flesh\nmost perversely inclined. After his first conversion he had a backsliding,\nwhich consisted in pounding a man who had insulted a girl. Feeling that,\nhaving once fallen, he might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb,\nhe got drunk and went and broke the jaw of another man who had lately\nchallenged him to fight and taunted him with cowardice for refusing as a\nChristian man;\u2014I mention these incidents to show how genuine a change of\nheart is implied in the later conduct which he describes as follows:\u2014\n\u201cI went down the drift and found the boy crying because a fellow\u2010\nworkman was trying to take the wagon from him by force. I said to\nhim:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018Tom, you mustn\u2019t take that wagon.\u2019\n\u201cHe swore at me, and called me a Methodist devil. I told him that\nGod did not tell me to let him rob me. He cursed again, and said\nhe would push the wagon over me.\n\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018let us see whether the devil and thee are\nstronger than the Lord and me.\u2019\n\u201cAnd the Lord and I proving stronger than the devil and he, he had\nto get out of the way, or the wagon would have gone over him. So I\ngave the wagon to the boy. Then said Tom:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019ve a good mind to smack thee on the face.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018if that will do thee any good, thou canst do\nit.\u2019 So he struck me on the face.\n\u201cI turned the other cheek to him, and said, \u2018Strike again.\u2019\n\u201cHe struck again and again, till he had struck me five times. I\nturned my cheek for the sixth stroke; but he turned away cursing.\nI shouted after him: \u2018The Lord forgive thee, for I do, and the\nLord save thee.\u2019\n\u201cThis was on a Saturday; and when I went home from the coal\u2010pit my\nwife saw my face was swollen, and asked what was the matter with\nit. I said: \u2018I\u2019ve been fighting, and I\u2019ve given a man a good\nthrashing.\u2019\n\u201cShe burst out weeping, and said, \u2018O Richard, what made you\nfight?\u2019 Then I told her all about it; and she thanked the Lord I\nhad not struck back.\n\u201cBut the Lord had struck, and his blows have more effect than\nman\u2019s. Monday came. The devil began to tempt me, saying: \u2018The\nother men will laugh at thee for allowing Tom to treat thee as he\ndid on Saturday.\u2019 I cried, \u2018Get thee behind me, Satan;\u2019\u2014and went\non my way to the coal\u2010pit.\n\u201cTom was the first man I saw. I said \u2018Good\u2010morning,\u2019 but got no\nreply.\n\u201cHe went down first. When I got down, I was surprised to see him\nsitting on the wagon\u2010road waiting for me. When I came to him he\nburst into tears and said: \u2018Richard, will you forgive me for\nstriking you?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018I have forgiven thee,\u2019 said I; \u2018ask God to forgive thee. The\nLord bless thee.\u2019 I gave him my hand, and we went each to his\nwork.\u201d(166)\n\u201cLove your enemies!\u201d Mark you, not simply those who happen not to be your\nfriends, but your _enemies_, your positive and active enemies. Either this\nis a mere Oriental hyperbole, a bit of verbal extravagance, meaning only\nthat we should, as far as we can, abate our animosities, or else it is\nsincere and literal. Outside of certain cases of intimate individual\nrelation, it seldom has been taken literally. Yet it makes one ask the\nquestion: Can there in general be a level of emotion so unifying, so\nobliterative of differences between man and man, that even enmity may come\nto be an irrelevant circumstance and fail to inhibit the friendlier\ninterests aroused? If positive well\u2010wishing could attain so supreme a\ndegree of excitement, those who were swayed by it might well seem\nsuperhuman beings. Their life would be morally discrete from the life of\nother men, and there is no saying, in the absence of positive experience\nof an authentic kind,\u2014for there are few active examples in our scriptures,\nand the Buddhistic examples are legendary,(167)\u2014what the effects might be:\nthey might conceivably transform the world.\nPsychologically and in principle, the precept \u201cLove your enemies\u201d is not\nself\u2010contradictory. It is merely the extreme limit of a kind of\nmagnanimity with which, in the shape of pitying tolerance of our\noppressors, we are fairly familiar. Yet if radically followed, it would\ninvolve such a breach with our instinctive springs of action as a whole,\nand with the present world\u2019s arrangements, that a critical point would\npractically be passed, and we should be born into another kingdom of\nbeing. Religious emotion makes us feel that other kingdom to be close at\nhand, within our reach.\nThe inhibition of instinctive repugnance is proved not only by the showing\nof love to enemies, but by the showing of it to any one who is personally\nloathsome. In the annals of saintliness we find a curious mixture of\nmotives impelling in this direction. Asceticism plays its part; and along\nwith charity pure and simple, we find humility or the desire to disclaim\ndistinction and to grovel on the common level before God. Certainly all\nthree principles were at work when Francis of Assisi and Ignatius Loyola\nexchanged their garments with those of filthy beggars. All three are at\nwork when religious persons consecrate their lives to the care of leprosy\nor other peculiarly unpleasant diseases. The nursing of the sick is a\nfunction to which the religious seem strongly drawn, even apart from the\nfact that church traditions set that way. But in the annals of this sort\nof charity we find fantastic excesses of devotion recorded which are only\nexplicable by the frenzy of self\u2010immolation simultaneously aroused.\nFrancis of Assisi kisses his lepers; Margaret Mary Alacoque, Francis\nXavier, St. John of God, and others are said to have cleansed the sores\nand ulcers of their patients with their respective tongues; and the lives\nof such saints as Elizabeth of Hungary and Madame de Chantal are full of a\nsort of reveling in hospital purulence, disagreeable to read of, and which\nmakes us admire and shudder at the same time.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nSo much for the human love aroused by the faith\u2010state. Let me next speak\nof the Equanimity, Resignation, Fortitude, and Patience which it brings.\n\u201cA paradise of inward tranquillity\u201d seems to be faith\u2019s usual result; and\nit is easy, even without being religious one\u2019s self, to understand this. A\nmoment back, in treating of the sense of God\u2019s presence, I spoke of the\nunaccountable feeling of safety which one may then have. And, indeed, how\ncan it possibly fail to steady the nerves, to cool the fever, and appease\nthe fret, if one be sensibly conscious that, no matter what one\u2019s\ndifficulties for the moment may appear to be, one\u2019s life as a whole is in\nthe keeping of a power whom one can absolutely trust? In deeply religious\nmen the abandonment of self to this power is passionate. Whoever not only\nsays, but _feels_, \u201cGod\u2019s will be done,\u201d is mailed against every weakness;\nand the whole historic array of martyrs, missionaries, and religious\nreformers is there to prove the tranquil\u2010mindedness, under naturally\nagitating or distressing circumstances, which self\u2010surrender brings.\nThe temper of the tranquil\u2010mindedness differs, of course, according as the\nperson is of a constitutionally sombre or of a constitutionally cheerful\ncast of mind. In the sombre it partakes more of resignation and\nsubmission; in the cheerful it is a joyous consent. As an example of the\nformer temper, I quote part of a letter from Professor Lagneau, a\nvenerated teacher of philosophy who lately died, a great invalid, at\nParis:\u2014\n\u201cMy life, for the success of which you send good wishes, will be\nwhat it is able to be. I ask nothing from it, I expect nothing\nfrom it. For long years now I exist, think, and act, and am worth\nwhat I am worth, only through the despair which is my sole\nstrength and my sole foundation. May it preserve for me, even in\nthese last trials to which I am coming, the courage to do without\nthe desire of deliverance. I ask nothing more from the Source\nwhence all strength cometh, and if that is granted, your wishes\nwill have been accomplished.\u201d(168)\nThere is something pathetic and fatalistic about this, but the power of\nsuch a tone as a protection against outward shocks is manifest. Pascal is\nanother Frenchman of pessimistic natural temperament. He expresses still\nmore amply the temper of self\u2010surrendering submissiveness:\u2014\n\u201cDeliver me, Lord,\u201d he writes in his prayers, \u201cfrom the sadness at\nmy proper suffering which self\u2010love might give, but put into me a\nsadness like your own. Let my sufferings appease your choler. Make\nthem an occasion for my conversion and salvation. I ask you\nneither for health nor for sickness, for life nor for death; but\nthat you may dispose of my health and my sickness, my life and my\ndeath, for your glory, for my salvation, and for the use of the\nChurch and of your saints, of whom I would by your grace be one.\nYou alone know what is expedient for me; you are the sovereign\nmaster; do with me according to your will. Give to me, or take\naway from me, only conform my will to yours. I know but one thing,\nLord, that it is good to follow you, and bad to offend you. Apart\nfrom that, I know not what is good or bad in anything. I know not\nwhich is most profitable to me, health or sickness, wealth or\npoverty, nor anything else in the world. That discernment is\nbeyond the power of men or angels, and is hidden among the secrets\nof your Providence, which I adore, but do not seek to\nfathom.\u201d(169)\nWhen we reach more optimistic temperaments, the resignation grows less\npassive. Examples are sown so broadcast throughout history that I might\nwell pass on without citation. As it is, I snatch at the first that occurs\nto my mind. Madame Guyon, a frail creature physically, was yet of a happy\nnative disposition. She went through many perils with admirable serenity\nof soul. After being sent to prison for heresy,\u2014\n\u201cSome of my friends,\u201d she writes, \u201cwept bitterly at the hearing of\nit, but such was my state of acquiescence and resignation that it\nfailed to draw any tears from me.... There appeared to be in me\nthen, as I find it to be in me now, such an entire loss of what\nregards myself, that any of my own interests gave me little pain\nor pleasure; ever wanting to will or wish for myself only the very\nthing which God does.\u201d In another place she writes: \u201cWe all of us\ncame near perishing in a river which we found it necessary to\npass. The carriage sank in the quicksand. Others who were with us\nthrew themselves out in excessive fright. But I found my thoughts\nso much taken up with God that I had no distinct sense of danger.\nIt is true that the thought of being drowned passed across my\nmind, but it cost no other sensation or reflection in me than\nthis\u2014that I felt quite contented and willing it were so, if it\nwere my heavenly Father\u2019s choice.\u201d Sailing from Nice to Genoa, a\nstorm keeps her eleven days at sea. \u201cAs the irritated waves dashed\nround us,\u201d she writes, \u201cI could not help experiencing a certain\ndegree of satisfaction in my mind. I pleased myself with thinking\nthat those mutinous billows, under the command of Him who does all\nthings rightly, might probably furnish me with a watery grave.\nPerhaps I carried the point too far, in the pleasure which I took\nin thus seeing myself beaten and bandied by the swelling waters.\nThose who were with me took notice of my intrepidity.\u201d(170)\nThe contempt of danger which religious enthusiasm produces may be even\nmore buoyant still. I take an example from that charming recent\nautobiography, \u201cWith Christ at Sea,\u201d by Frank Bullen. A couple of days\nafter he went through the conversion on shipboard of which he there gives\nan account,\u2014\n\u201cIt was blowing stiffly,\u201d he writes, \u201cand we were carrying a press\nof canvas to get north out of the bad weather. Shortly after four\nbells we hauled down the flying\u2010jib, and I sprang out astride the\nboom to furl it. I was sitting astride the boom when suddenly it\ngave way with me. The sail slipped through my fingers, and I fell\nbackwards, hanging head downwards over the seething tumult of\nshining foam under the ship\u2019s bows, suspended by one foot. But I\nfelt only high exultation in my certainty of eternal life.\nAlthough death was divided from me by a hair\u2019s breadth, and I was\nacutely conscious of the fact, it gave me no sensation but joy. I\nsuppose I could have hung there no longer than five seconds, but\nin that time I lived a whole age of delight. But my body asserted\nitself, and with a desperate gymnastic effort I regained the boom.\nHow I furled the sail I don\u2019t know, but I sang at the utmost pitch\nof my voice praises to God that went pealing out over the dark\nwaste of waters.\u201d(171)\nThe annals of martyrdom are of course the signal field of triumph for\nreligious imperturbability. Let me cite as an example the statement of a\nhumble sufferer, persecuted as a Huguenot under Louis XIV.:\u2014\n\u201cThey shut all the doors,\u201d Blanche Gamond writes, \u201cand I saw six\nwomen, each with a bunch of willow rods as thick as the hand could\nhold, and a yard long. He gave me the order, \u2018Undress yourself,\u2019\nwhich I did. He said, \u2018You are leaving on your shift; you must\ntake it off.\u2019 They had so little patience that they took it off\nthemselves, and I was naked from the waist up. They brought a cord\nwith which they tied me to a beam in the kitchen. They drew the\ncord tight with all their strength and asked me, \u2018Does it hurt\nyou?\u2019 and then they discharged their fury upon me, exclaiming as\nthey struck me, \u2018Pray now to your God.\u2019 It was the Roulette woman\nwho held this language. But at this moment I received the greatest\nconsolation that I can ever receive in my life, since I had the\nhonor of being whipped for the name of Christ, and in addition of\nbeing crowned with his mercy and his consolations. Why can I not\nwrite down the inconceivable influences, consolations, and peace\nwhich I felt interiorly? To understand them one must have passed\nby the same trial; they were so great that I was ravished, for\nthere where afflictions abound grace is given superabundantly. In\nvain the women cried, \u2018We must double our blows; she does not feel\nthem, for she neither speaks nor cries.\u2019 And how should I have\ncried, since I was swooning with happiness within?\u201d(172)\nThe transition from tenseness, self\u2010responsibility, and worry, to\nequanimity, receptivity, and peace, is the most wonderful of all those\nshiftings of inner equilibrium, those changes of the personal centre of\nenergy, which I have analyzed so often; and the chief wonder of it is that\nit so often comes about, not by doing, but by simply relaxing and throwing\nthe burden down. This abandonment of self\u2010responsibility seems to be the\nfundamental act in specifically religious, as distinguished from moral\npractice. It antedates theologies and is independent of philosophies.\nMind\u2010cure, theosophy, stoicism, ordinary neurological hygiene, insist on\nit as emphatically as Christianity does, and it is capable of entering\ninto closest marriage with every speculative creed.(173) Christians who\nhave it strongly live in what is called \u201crecollection,\u201d and are never\nanxious about the future, nor worry over the outcome of the day. Of Saint\nCatharine of Genoa it is said that \u201cshe took cognizance of things, only as\nthey were presented to her in succession, _moment by moment_.\u201d To her holy\nsoul, \u201cthe divine moment was the present moment,... and when the present\nmoment was estimated in itself and in its relations, and when the duty\nthat was involved in it was accomplished, it was permitted to pass away as\nif it had never been, and to give way to the facts and duties of the\nmoment which came after.\u201d(174)\nHinduism, mind\u2010cure, and theosophy all lay great emphasis upon this\nconcentration of the consciousness upon the moment at hand.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next religious symptom which I will note is what I have called Purity\nof Life. The saintly person becomes exceedingly sensitive to inner\ninconsistency or discord, and mixture and confusion grow intolerable. All\nthe mind\u2019s objects and occupations must be ordered with reference to the\nspecial spiritual excitement which is now its keynote. Whatever is\nunspiritual taints the pure water of the soul and is repugnant. Mixed with\nthis exaltation of the moral sensibilities there is also an ardor of\nsacrifice, for the beloved deity\u2019s sake, of everything unworthy of him.\nSometimes the spiritual ardor is so sovereign that purity is achieved at a\nstroke\u2014we have seen examples. Usually it is a more gradual conquest. Billy\nBray\u2019s account of his abandonment of tobacco is a good example of the\nlatter form of achievement.\n\u201cI had been a smoker as well as a drunkard, and I used to love my\ntobacco as much as I loved my meat, and I would rather go down\ninto the mine without my dinner than without my pipe. In the days\nof old, the Lord spoke by the mouths of his servants, the\nprophets; now he speaks to us by the spirit of his Son. I had not\nonly the feeling part of religion, but I could hear the small,\nstill voice within speaking to me. When I took the pipe to smoke,\nit would be applied within, \u2018It is an idol, a lust; worship the\nLord with clean lips.\u2019 So, I felt it was not right to smoke. The\nLord also sent a woman to convince me. I was one day in a house,\nand I took out my pipe to light it at the fire, and Mary Hawke\u2014for\nthat was the woman\u2019s name\u2014said, \u2018Do you not feel it is wrong to\nsmoke?\u2019 I said that I felt something inside telling me that it was\nan idol, a lust, and she said that was the Lord. Then I said,\n\u2018Now, I must give it up, for the Lord is telling me of it inside,\nand the woman outside, so the tobacco must go, love it as I may.\u2019\nThere and then I took the tobacco out of my pocket, and threw it\ninto the fire, and put the pipe under my foot, \u2018ashes to ashes,\ndust to dust.\u2019 And I have not smoked since. I found it hard to\nbreak off old habits, but I cried to the Lord for help, and he\ngave me strength, for he has said, \u2018Call upon me in the day of\ntrouble, and I will deliver thee.\u2019 The day after I gave up smoking\nI had the toothache so bad that I did not know what to do. I\nthought this was owing to giving up the pipe, but I said I would\nnever smoke again, if I lost every tooth in my head. I said,\n\u2018Lord, thou hast told us My yoke is easy and my burden is light,\u2019\nand when I said that, all the pain left me. Sometimes the thought\nof the pipe would come back to me very strong; but the Lord\nstrengthened me against the habit, and, bless his name, I have not\nsmoked since.\u201d\nBray\u2019s biographer writes that after he had given up smoking, he\nthought that he would chew a little, but he conquered this dirty\nhabit, too. \u201cOn one occasion,\u201d Bray said, \u201cwhen at a prayer\u2010\nmeeting at Hicks Mill, I heard the Lord say to me, \u2018Worship me\nwith clean lips.\u2019 So, when we got up from our knees, I took the\nquid out of my mouth and \u2018whipped \u2019en\u2019 [threw it] under the form.\nBut, when we got on our knees again, I put another quid into my\nmouth. Then the Lord said to me again, \u2018Worship me with clean\nlips.\u2019 So I took the quid out of my mouth, and whipped \u2019en under\nthe form again, and said, \u2018Yes, Lord, I will.\u2019 From that time I\ngave up chewing as well as smoking, and have been a free man.\u201d\nThe ascetic forms which the impulse for veracity and purity of life may\ntake are often pathetic enough. The early Quakers, for example, had hard\nbattles to wage against the worldliness and insincerity of the\necclesiastical Christianity of their time. Yet the battle that cost them\nmost wounds was probably that which they fought in defense of their own\nright to social veracity and sincerity in their thee\u2010ing and thou\u2010ing, in\nnot doffing the hat or giving titles of respect. It was laid on George Fox\nthat these conventional customs were a lie and a sham, and the whole body\nof his followers thereupon renounced them, as a sacrifice to truth, and so\nthat their acts and the spirit they professed might be more in accord.\n\u201cWhen the Lord sent me into the world,\u201d says Fox in his Journal,\n\u201che forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low: and I was\nrequired to \u2018thee\u2019 and \u2018thou\u2019 all men and women, without any\nrespect to rich or poor, great or small. And as I traveled up and\ndown, I was not to bid people Good\u2010morning, or Good\u2010evening,\nneither might I bow or scrape with my leg to any one. This made\nthe sects and professions rage. Oh! the rage that was in the\npriests, magistrates, professors, and people of all sorts: and\nespecially in priests and professors: for though \u2018thou\u2019 to a\nsingle person was according to their accidence and grammar rules,\nand according to the Bible, yet they could not bear to hear it:\nand because I could not put off my hat to them, it set them all\ninto a rage.... Oh! the scorn, heat, and fury that arose! Oh! the\nblows, punchings, beatings, and imprisonments that we underwent\nfor not putting off our hats to men! Some had their hats violently\nplucked off and thrown away, so that they quite lost them. The bad\nlanguage and evil usage we received on this account is hard to be\nexpressed, besides the danger we were sometimes in of losing our\nlives for this matter, and that by the great professors of\nChristianity, who thereby discovered they were not true believers.\nAnd though it was but a small thing in the eye of man, yet a\nwonderful confusion it brought among all professors and priests:\nbut, blessed be the Lord, many came to see the vanity of that\ncustom of putting off hats to men, and felt the weight of Truth\u2019s\ntestimony against it.\u201d\nIn the autobiography of Thomas Elwood, an early Quaker, who at one time\nwas secretary to John Milton, we find an exquisitely quaint and candid\naccount of the trials he underwent both at home and abroad, in following\nFox\u2019s canons of sincerity. The anecdotes are too lengthy for citation; but\nElwood sets down his manner of feeling about these things in a shorter\npassage, which I will quote as a characteristic utterance of spiritual\nsensibility:\u2014\n\u201cBy this divine light, then,\u201d says Elwood, \u201cI saw that though I\nhad not the evil of the common uncleanliness, debauchery,\nprofaneness, and pollutions of the world to put away, because I\nhad, through the great goodness of God and a civil education, been\npreserved out of those grosser evils, yet I had many other evils\nto put away and to cease from; some of which were not by the\nworld, which lies in wickedness (1 John v. 19), accounted evils,\nbut by the light of Christ were made manifest to me to be evils,\nand as such condemned in me.\n\u201cAs particularly those fruits and effects of pride that discover\nthemselves in the vanity and superfluity of apparel; which I took\ntoo much delight in. This evil of my doings I was required to put\naway and cease from; and judgment lay upon me till I did so.\n\u201cI took off from my apparel those unnecessary trimmings of lace,\nribbons, and useless buttons, which had no real service, but were\nset on only for that which was by mistake called ornament; and I\nceased to wear rings.\n\u201cAgain, the giving of flattering titles to men between whom and me\nthere was not any relation to which such titles could be pretended\nto belong. This was an evil I had been much addicted to, and was\naccounted a ready artist in; therefore this evil also was I\nrequired to put away and cease from. So that thenceforward I durst\nnot say, Sir, Master, My Lord, Madam (or My Dame); or say Your\nServant to any one to whom I did not stand in the real relation of\na servant, which I had never done to any.\n\u201cAgain, respect of persons, in uncovering the head and bowing the\nknee or body in salutation, was a practice I had been much in the\nuse of; and this, being one of the vain customs of the world,\nintroduced by the spirit of the world, instead of the true honor\nwhich this is a false representation of, and used in deceit as a\ntoken of respect by persons one to another, who bear no real\nrespect one to another; and besides this, being a type and a\nproper emblem of that divine honor which all ought to pay to\nAlmighty God, and which all of all sorts, who take upon them the\nChristian name, appear in when they offer their prayers to him,\nand therefore should not be given to men;\u2014I found this to be one\nof those evils which I had been too long doing; therefore I was\nnow required to put it away and cease from it.\n\u201cAgain, the corrupt and unsound form of speaking in the plural\nnumber to a single person, _you_ to one, instead of _thou_,\ncontrary to the pure, plain, and single language of truth, _thou_\nto one, and _you_ to more than one, which had always been used by\nGod to men, and men to God, as well as one to another, from the\noldest record of time till corrupt men, for corrupt ends, in later\nand corrupt times, to flatter, fawn, and work upon the corrupt\nnature in men, brought in that false and senseless way of speaking\n_you_ to one, which has since corrupted the modern languages, and\nhath greatly debased the spirits and depraved the manners of\nmen;\u2014this evil custom I had been as forward in as others, and this\nI was now called out of and required to cease from.\n\u201cThese and many more evil customs which had sprung up in the night\nof darkness and general apostasy from the truth and true religion\nwere now, by the inshining of this pure ray of divine light in my\nconscience, gradually discovered to me to be what I ought to cease\nfrom, shun, and stand a witness against.\u201d(175)\nThese early Quakers were Puritans indeed. The slightest inconsistency\nbetween profession and deed jarred some of them to active protest. John\nWoolman writes in his diary:\u2014\n\u201cIn these journeys I have been where much cloth hath been dyed;\nand have at sundry times walked over ground where much of their\ndyestuffs has drained away. This hath produced a longing in my\nmind that people might come into cleanness of spirit, cleanness of\nperson, and cleanness about their houses and garments. Dyes being\ninvented partly to please the eye, and partly to hide dirt, I have\nfelt in this weak state, when traveling in dirtiness, and affected\nwith unwholesome scents, a strong desire that the nature of dyeing\ncloth to hide dirt may be more fully considered.\n\u201cWashing our garments to keep them sweet is cleanly, but it is the\nopposite to real cleanliness to hide dirt in them. Through giving\nway to hiding dirt in our garments a spirit which would conceal\nthat which is disagreeable is strengthened. Real cleanliness\nbecometh a holy people; but hiding that which is not clean by\ncoloring our garments seems contrary to the sweetness of\nsincerity. Through some sorts of dyes cloth is rendered less\nuseful. And if the value of dyestuffs, and expense of dyeing, and\nthe damage done to cloth, were all added together, and that cost\napplied to keeping all sweet and clean, how much more would real\ncleanliness prevail.\n\u201cThinking often on these things, the use of hats and garments dyed\nwith a dye hurtful to them, and wearing more clothes in summer\nthan are useful, grew more uneasy to me; believing them to be\ncustoms which have not their foundation in pure wisdom. The\napprehension of being singular from my beloved friends was a\nstrait upon me; and thus I continued in the use of some things,\ncontrary to my judgment, about nine months. Then I thought of\ngetting a hat the natural color of the fur, but the apprehension\nof being looked upon as one affecting singularity felt uneasy to\nme. On this account I was under close exercise of mind in the time\nof our general spring meeting in 1762, greatly desiring to be\nrightly directed; when, being deeply bowed in spirit before the\nLord, I was made willing to submit to what I apprehended was\nrequired of me; and when I returned home, got a hat of the natural\ncolor of the fur.\n\u201cIn attending meetings, this singularity was a trial to me, and\nmore especially at this time, as white hats were used by some who\nwere fond of following the changeable modes of dress, and as some\nfriends, who knew not from what motives I wore it, grew shy of me,\nI felt my way for a time shut up in the exercise of the ministry.\nSome friends were apprehensive that my wearing such a hat savored\nof an affected singularity: those who spoke with me in a friendly\nway, I generally informed in a few words, that I believed my\nwearing it was not in my own will.\u201d\nWhen the craving for moral consistency and purity is developed to this\ndegree, the subject may well find the outer world too full of shocks to\ndwell in, and can unify his life and keep his soul unspotted only by\nwithdrawing from it. That law which impels the artist to achieve harmony\nin his composition by simply dropping out whatever jars, or suggests a\ndiscord, rules also in the spiritual life. To omit, says Stevenson, is the\none art in literature: \u201cIf I knew how to omit, I should ask no other\nknowledge.\u201d And life, when full of disorder and slackness and vague\nsuperfluity, can no more have what we call character than literature can\nhave it under similar conditions. So monasteries and communities of\nsympathetic devotees open their doors, and in their changeless order,\ncharacterized by omissions quite as much as constituted of actions, the\nholy\u2010minded person finds that inner smoothness and cleanness which it is\ntorture to him to feel violated at every turn by the discordancy and\nbrutality of secular existence.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThat the scrupulosity of purity may be carried to a fantastic extreme must\nbe admitted. In this it resembles Asceticism, to which further symptom of\nsaintliness we had better turn next. The adjective \u201cascetic\u201d is applied to\nconduct originating on diverse psychological levels, which I might as well\nbegin by distinguishing from one another.\n1. Asceticism may be a mere expression of organic hardihood,\ndisgusted with too much ease.\n2. Temperance in meat and drink, simplicity of apparel, chastity,\nand non\u2010pampering of the body generally, may be fruits of the love\nof purity, shocked by whatever savors of the sensual.\n3. They may also be fruits of love, that is, they may appeal to\nthe subject in the light of sacrifices which he is happy in making\nto the Deity whom he acknowledges.\n4. Again, ascetic mortifications and torments may be due to\npessimistic feelings about the self, combined with theological\nbeliefs concerning expiation. The devotee may feel that he is\nbuying himself free, or escaping worse sufferings hereafter, by\ndoing penance now.\n5. In psychopathic persons, mortifications may be entered on\nirrationally, by a sort of obsession or fixed idea which comes as\na challenge and must be worked off, because only thus does the\nsubject get his interior consciousness feeling right again.\n6. Finally, ascetic exercises may in rarer instances be prompted\nby genuine perversions of the bodily sensibility, in consequence\nof which normally pain\u2010giving stimuli are actually felt as\npleasures.\nI will try to give an instance under each of these heads in turn; but it\nis not easy to get them pure, for in cases pronounced enough to be\nimmediately classed as ascetic, several of the assigned motives usually\nwork together. Moreover, before citing any examples at all, I must invite\nyou to some general psychological considerations which apply to all of\nthem alike.\nA strange moral transformation has within the past century swept over our\nWestern world. We no longer think that we are called on to face physical\npain with equanimity. It is not expected of a man that he should either\nendure it or inflict much of it, and to listen to the recital of cases of\nit makes our flesh creep morally as well as physically. The way in which\nour ancestors looked upon pain as an eternal ingredient of the world\u2019s\norder, and both caused and suffered it as a matter\u2010of\u2010course portion of\ntheir day\u2019s work, fills us with amazement. We wonder that any human beings\ncould have been so callous. The result of this historic alteration is that\neven in the Mother Church herself, where ascetic discipline has such a\nfixed traditional prestige as a factor of merit, it has largely come into\ndesuetude, if not discredit. A believer who flagellates or \u201cmacerates\u201d\nhimself to\u2010day arouses more wonder and fear than emulation. Many Catholic\nwriters who admit that the times have changed in this respect do so\nresignedly; and even add that perhaps it is as well not to waste feelings\nin regretting the matter, for to return to the heroic corporeal discipline\nof ancient days might be an extravagance.\nWhere to seek the easy and the pleasant seems instinctive\u2014and instinctive\nit appears to be in man; any deliberate tendency to pursue the hard and\npainful as such and for their own sakes might well strike one as purely\nabnormal. Nevertheless, in moderate degrees it is natural and even usual\nto human nature to court the arduous. It is only the extreme\nmanifestations of the tendency that can be regarded as a paradox.\nThe psychological reasons for this lie near the surface. When we drop\nabstractions and take what we call our will in the act, we see that it is\na very complex function. It involves both stimulations and inhibitions; it\nfollows generalized habits; it is escorted by reflective criticisms; and\nit leaves a good or a bad taste of itself behind, according to the manner\nof the performance. The result is that, quite apart from the immediate\npleasure which any sensible experience may give us, our own general moral\nattitude in procuring or undergoing the experience brings with it a\nsecondary satisfaction or distaste. Some men and women, indeed, there are\nwho can live on smiles and the word \u201cyes\u201d forever. But for others (indeed\nfor most), this is too tepid and relaxed a moral climate. Passive\nhappiness is slack and insipid, and soon grows mawkish and intolerable.\nSome austerity and wintry negativity, some roughness, danger, stringency,\nand effort, some \u201cno! no!\u201d must be mixed in, to produce the sense of an\nexistence with character and texture and power. The range of individual\ndifferences in this respect is enormous; but whatever the mixture of yeses\nand noes may be, the person is infallibly aware when he has struck it in\nthe right proportion _for him_. This, he feels, is my proper vocation,\nthis is the _optimum_, the law, the life for me to live. Here I find the\ndegree of equilibrium, safety, calm, and leisure which I need, or here I\nfind the challenge, passion, fight, and hardship without which my soul\u2019s\nenergy expires.\nEvery individual soul, in short, like every individual machine or\norganism, has its own best conditions of efficiency. A given machine will\nrun best under a certain steam\u2010pressure, a certain amperage; an organism\nunder a certain diet, weight, or exercise. You seem to do best, I heard a\ndoctor say to a patient, at about 140 millimeters of arterial tension. And\nit is just so with our sundry souls: some are happiest in calm weather;\nsome need the sense of tension, of strong volition, to make them feel\nalive and well. For these latter souls, whatever is gained from day to day\nmust be paid for by sacrifice and inhibition, or else it comes too cheap\nand has no zest.\nNow when characters of this latter sort become religious, they are apt to\nturn the edge of their need of effort and negativity against their natural\nself; and the ascetic life gets evolved as a consequence.\nWhen Professor Tyndall in one of his lectures tells us that Thomas Carlyle\nput him into his bath\u2010tub every morning of a freezing Berlin winter, he\nproclaimed one of the lowest grades of asceticism. Even without Carlyle,\nmost of us find it necessary to our soul\u2019s health to start the day with a\nrather cool immersion. A little farther along the scale we get such\nstatements as this, from one of my correspondents, an agnostic:\u2014\n\u201cOften at night in my warm bed I would feel ashamed to depend so\non the warmth, and whenever the thought would come over me I would\nhave to get up, no matter what time of night it was, and stand for\na minute in the cold, just so as to prove my manhood.\u201d\nSuch cases as these belong simply to our head 1. In the next case we\nprobably have a mixture of heads 2 and 3\u2014the asceticism becomes far more\nsystematic and pronounced. The writer is a Protestant, whose sense of\nmoral energy could doubtless be gratified on no lower terms, and I take\nhis case from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection.\n\u201cI practiced fasting and mortification of the flesh. I secretly\nmade burlap shirts, and put the burrs next the skin, and wore\npebbles in my shoes. I would spend nights flat on my back on the\nfloor without any covering.\u201d\nThe Roman Church has organized and codified all this sort of thing, and\ngiven it a market\u2010value in the shape of \u201cmerit.\u201d But we see the\ncultivation of hardship cropping out under every sky and in every faith,\nas a spontaneous need of character. Thus we read of Channing, when first\nsettled as a Unitarian minister, that\u2014\n\u201cHe was now more simple than ever, and seemed to have become\nincapable of any form of self\u2010indulgence. He took the smallest\nroom in the house for his study, though he might easily have\ncommanded one more light, airy, and in every way more suitable;\nand chose for his sleeping chamber an attic which he shared with a\nyounger brother. The furniture of the latter might have answered\nfor the cell of an anchorite, and consisted of a hard mattress on\na cot\u2010bedstead, plain wooden chairs and table, with matting on the\nfloor. It was without fire, and to cold he was throughout life\nextremely sensitive; but he never complained or appeared in any\nway to be conscious of inconvenience. \u2018I recollect,\u2019 says his\nbrother, \u2018after one most severe night, that in the morning he\nsportively thus alluded to his suffering: \u201cIf my bed were my\ncountry, I should be somewhat like Bonaparte: I have no control\nexcept over the part which I occupy; the instant I move, frost\ntakes possession.\u201d \u2019 In sickness only would he change for the time\nhis apartment and accept a few comforts. The dress too that he\nhabitually adopted was of most inferior quality; and garments were\nconstantly worn which the world would call mean, though an almost\nfeminine neatness preserved him from the least appearance of\nneglect.\u201d(176)\nChanning\u2019s asceticism, such as it was, was evidently a compound of\nhardihood and love of purity. The democracy which is an offshoot of the\nenthusiasm of humanity, and of which I will speak later under the head of\nthe cult of poverty, doubtless bore also a share. Certainly there was no\npessimistic element in his case. In the next case we have a strongly\npessimistic element, so that it belongs under head 4. John Cennick was\nMethodism\u2019s first lay preacher. In 1735 he was convicted of sin, while\nwalking in Cheapside,\u2014\n\u201cAnd at once left off song\u2010singing, card\u2010playing, and attending\ntheatres. Sometimes he wished to go to a popish monastery, to\nspend his life in devout retirement. At other times he longed to\nlive in a cave, sleeping on fallen leaves, and feeding on forest\nfruits. He fasted long and often, and prayed nine times a day....\nFancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so great a sinner\nas himself, he began to feed on potatoes, acorns, crabs, and\ngrass; and often wished that he could live on roots and herbs. At\nlength, in 1737, he found peace with God, and went on his way\nrejoicing.\u201d(177)\nIn this poor man we have morbid melancholy and fear, and the sacrifices\nmade are to purge out sin, and to buy safety. The hopelessness of\nChristian theology in respect of the flesh and the natural man generally\nhas, in systematizing fear, made of it one tremendous incentive to self\u2010\nmortification. It would be quite unfair, however, in spite of the fact\nthat this incentive has often been worked in a mercenary way for hortatory\npurposes, to call it a mercenary incentive. The impulse to expiate and do\npenance is, in its first intention, far too immediate and spontaneous an\nexpression of self\u2010despair and anxiety to be obnoxious to any such\nreproach. In the form of loving sacrifice, of spending all we have to show\nour devotion, ascetic discipline of the severest sort may be the fruit of\nhighly optimistic religious feeling.\nM. Vianney, the cur\u00e9 of Ars, was a French country priest, whose holiness\nwas exemplary. We read in his life the following account of his inner need\nof sacrifice:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018On this path,\u2019 M. Vianney said, \u2018it is only the first step that\ncosts. There is in mortification a balm and a savor without which\none cannot live when once one has made their acquaintance. There\nis but one way in which to give one\u2019s self to God,\u2014that is, to\ngive one\u2019s self entirely, and to keep nothing for one\u2019s self. The\nlittle that one keeps is only good to double one and make one\nsuffer.\u2019 Accordingly he imposed it on himself that he should never\nsmell a flower, never drink when parched with thirst, never drive\naway a fly, never show disgust before a repugnant object, never\ncomplain of anything that had to do with his personal comfort,\nnever sit down, never lean upon his elbows when he was kneeling.\nThe Cur\u00e9 of Ars was very sensitive to cold, but he would never\ntake means to protect himself against it. During a very severe\nwinter, one of his missionaries contrived a false floor to his\nconfessional and placed a metal case of hot water beneath. The\ntrick succeeded, and the Saint was deceived: \u2018God is very good,\u2019\nhe said with emotion. \u2018This year, through all the cold, my feet\nhave always been warm.\u2019 \u201d(178)\nIn this case the spontaneous impulse to make sacrifices for the pure love\nof God was probably the uppermost conscious motive. We may class it, then,\nunder our head 3. Some authors think that the impulse to sacrifice is the\nmain religious phenomenon. It is a prominent, a universal phenomenon\ncertainly, and lies deeper than any special creed. Here, for instance, is\nwhat seems to be a spontaneous example of it, simply expressing what\nseemed right at the time between the individual and his Maker. Cotton\nMather, the New England Puritan divine, is generally reputed a rather\ngrotesque pedant; yet what is more touchingly simple than his relation of\nwhat happened when his wife came to die?\n\u201cWhen I saw to what a point of resignation I was now called of the\nLord,\u201d he says, \u201cI resolved, with his help, therein to glorify\nhim. So, two hours before my lovely consort expired, I kneeled by\nher bedside, and I took into my two hands a dear hand, the dearest\nin the world. With her thus in my hands, I solemnly and sincerely\ngave her up unto the Lord: and in token of my real _Resignation_,\nI gently put her out of my hands, and laid away a most lovely\nhand, resolving that I would never touch it more. This was the\nhardest, and perhaps the bravest action that ever I did. She ...\ntold me that she signed and sealed my act of resignation. And\nthough before that she called for me continually, she after this\nnever asked for me any more.\u201d(179)\nFather Vianney\u2019s asceticism taken in its totality was simply the result of\na permanent flood of high spiritual enthusiasm, longing to make proof of\nitself. The Roman Church has, in its incomparable fashion, collected all\nthe motives towards asceticism together, and so codified them that any one\nwishing to pursue Christian perfection may find a practical system mapped\nout for him in any one of a number of ready\u2010made manuals.(180) The\ndominant Church notion of perfection is of course the negative one of\navoidance of sin. Sin proceeds from concupiscence, and concupiscence from\nour carnal passions and temptations, chief of which are pride, sensuality\nin all its forms, and the loves of worldly excitement and possession. All\nthese sources of sin must be resisted; and discipline and austerities are\na most efficacious mode of meeting them. Hence there are always in these\nbooks chapters on self\u2010mortification. But whenever a procedure is\ncodified, the more delicate spirit of it evaporates, and if we wish the\nundiluted ascetic spirit,\u2014the passion of self\u2010contempt wreaking itself on\nthe poor flesh, the divine irrationality of devotion making a sacrificial\ngift of all it has (its sensibilities, namely) to the object of its\nadoration,\u2014we must go to autobiographies, or other individual documents.\nSaint John of the Cross, a Spanish mystic who flourished\u2014or rather who\nexisted, for there was little that suggested flourishing about him\u2014in the\nsixteenth century, will supply a passage suitable for our purpose.\n\u201cFirst of all, carefully excite in yourself an habitual\naffectionate will in all things to imitate Jesus Christ. If\nanything agreeable offers itself to your senses, yet does not at\nthe same time tend purely to the honor and glory of God, renounce\nit and separate yourself from it for the love of Christ, who all\nhis life long had no other taste or wish than to do the will of\nhis Father whom he called his meat and nourishment. For example,\nyou take satisfaction in _hearing_ of things in which the glory of\nGod bears no part. Deny yourself this satisfaction, mortify your\nwish to listen. You take pleasure in _seeing_ objects which do not\nraise your mind to God: refuse yourself this pleasure, and turn\naway your eyes. The same with conversations and all other things.\nAct similarly, so far as you are able, with all the operations of\nthe senses, striving to make yourself free from their yokes.\n\u201cThe radical remedy lies in the mortification of the four great\nnatural passions, joy, hope, fear, and grief. You must seek to\ndeprive these of every satisfaction and leave them as it were in\ndarkness and the void. Let your soul therefore turn always:\n\u201cNot to what is most easy, but to what is hardest;\n\u201cNot to what tastes best, but to what is most distasteful;\n\u201cNot to what most pleases, but to what disgusts;\n\u201cNot to matter of consolation, but to matter for desolation\nrather;\n\u201cNot to rest, but to labor;\n\u201cNot to desire the more, but the less;\n\u201cNot to aspire to what is highest and most precious, but to what\nis lowest and most contemptible;\n\u201cNot to will anything, but to will nothing;\n\u201cNot to seek the best in everything, but to seek the worst, so\nthat you may enter for the love of Christ into a complete\ndestitution, a perfect poverty of spirit, and an absolute\nrenunciation of everything in this world.\n\u201cEmbrace these practices with all the energy of your soul and you\nwill find in a short time great delights and unspeakable\nconsolations.\n\u201cDespise yourself, and wish that others should despise you.\n\u201cSpeak to your own disadvantage, and desire others to do the same;\n\u201cConceive a low opinion of yourself, and find it good when others\nhold the same;\n\u201cTo enjoy the taste of all things, have no taste for anything.\n\u201cTo know all things, learn to know nothing.\n\u201cTo possess all things, resolve to possess nothing.\n\u201cTo be all things, be willing to be nothing.\n\u201cTo get to where you have no taste for anything, go through\nwhatever experiences you have no taste for.\n\u201cTo learn to know nothing, go whither you are ignorant.\n\u201cTo reach what you possess not, go whithersoever you own nothing.\n\u201cTo be what you are not, experience what you are not.\u201d\nThese later verses play with that vertigo of self\u2010contradiction which is\nso dear to mysticism. Those that come next are completely mystical, for in\nthem Saint John passes from God to the more metaphysical notion of the\nAll.\n\u201cWhen you stop at one thing, you cease to open yourself to the\nAll.\n\u201cFor to come to the All you must give up the All.\n\u201cAnd if you should attain to owning the All, you must own it,\ndesiring Nothing.\n\u201cIn this spoliation, the soul finds its tranquillity and rest.\nProfoundly established in the centre of its own nothingness, it\ncan be assailed by naught that comes from below; and since it no\nlonger desires anything, what comes from above cannot depress it;\nfor its desires alone are the causes of its woes.\u201d(181)\nAnd now, as a more concrete example of heads 4 and 5, in fact of all our\nheads together, and of the irrational extreme to which a psychopathic\nindividual may go in the line of bodily austerity, I will quote the\nsincere Suso\u2019s account of his own self\u2010tortures. Suso, you will remember,\nwas one of the fourteenth century German mystics; his autobiography,\nwritten in the third person, is a classic religious document.\n\u201cHe was in his youth of a temperament full of fire and life; and\nwhen this began to make itself felt, it was very grievous to him;\nand he sought by many devices how he might bring his body into\nsubjection. He wore for a long time a hair shirt and an iron\nchain, until the blood ran from him, so that he was obliged to\nleave them off. He secretly caused an undergarment to be made for\nhim; and in the undergarment he had strips of leather fixed, into\nwhich a hundred and fifty brass nails, pointed and filed sharp,\nwere driven, and the points of the nails were always turned\ntowards the flesh. He had this garment made very tight, and so\narranged as to go round him and fasten in front, in order that it\nmight fit the closer to his body, and the pointed nails might be\ndriven into his flesh; and it was high enough to reach upwards to\nhis navel. In this he used to sleep at night. Now in summer, when\nit was hot, and he was very tired and ill from his journeyings, or\nwhen he held the office of lecturer, he would sometimes, as he lay\nthus in bonds, and oppressed with toil, and tormented also by\nnoxious insects, cry aloud and give way to fretfulness, and twist\nround and round in agony, as a worm does when run through with a\npointed needle. It often seemed to him as if he were lying upon an\nant\u2010hill, from the torture caused by the insects; for if he wished\nto sleep, or when he had fallen asleep, they vied with one\nanother.(182) Sometimes he cried to Almighty God in the fullness\nof his heart: Alas! Gentle God, what a dying is this! When a man\nis killed by murderers or strong beasts of prey it is soon over;\nbut I lie dying here under the cruel insects, and yet cannot die.\nThe nights in winter were never so long, nor was the summer so\nhot, as to make him leave off this exercise. On the contrary, he\ndevised something farther\u2014two leathern loops into which he put his\nhands, and fastened one on each side his throat, and made the\nfastenings so secure that even if his cell had been on fire about\nhim, he could not have helped himself. This he continued until his\nhands and arms had become almost tremulous with the strain, and\nthen he devised something else: two leather gloves; and he caused\na brazier to fit them all over with sharp\u2010pointed brass tacks, and\nhe used to put them on at night, in order that if he should try\nwhile asleep to throw off the hair undergarment, or relieve\nhimself from the gnawings of the vile insects, the tacks might\nthen stick into his body. And so it came to pass. If ever he\nsought to help himself with his hands in his sleep, he drove the\nsharp tacks into his breast, and tore himself, so that his flesh\nfestered. When after many weeks the wounds had healed, he tore\nhimself again and made fresh wounds.\n\u201cHe continued this tormenting exercise for about sixteen years. At\nthe end of this time, when his blood was now chilled, and the fire\nof his temperament destroyed, there appeared to him in a vision on\nWhitsunday, a messenger from heaven, who told him that God\nrequired this of him no longer. Whereupon he discontinued it, and\nthrew all these things away into a running stream.\u201d\nSuso then tells how, to emulate the sorrows of his crucified Lord,\nhe made himself a cross with thirty protruding iron needles and\nnails. This he bore on his bare back between his shoulders day and\nnight. \u201cThe first time that he stretched out this cross upon his\nback his tender frame was struck with terror at it, and blunted\nthe sharp nails slightly against a stone. But soon, repenting of\nthis womanly cowardice, he pointed them all again with a file, and\nplaced once more the cross upon him. It made his back, where the\nbones are, bloody and seared. Whenever he sat down or stood up, it\nwas as if a hedgehog\u2010skin were on him. If any one touched him\nunawares, or pushed against his clothes, it tore him.\u201d\nSuso next tells of his penitences by means of striking this cross\nand forcing the nails deeper into the flesh, and likewise of his\nself\u2010scourgings,\u2014a dreadful story,\u2014and then goes on as follows:\n\u201cAt this same period the Servitor procured an old castaway door,\nand he used to lie upon it at night without any bedclothes to make\nhim comfortable, except that he took off his shoes and wrapped a\nthick cloak round him. He thus secured for himself a most\nmiserable bed; for hard pea\u2010stalks lay in humps under his head,\nthe cross with the sharp nails stuck into his back, his arms were\nlocked fast in bonds, the horsehair undergarment was round his\nloins, and the cloak too was heavy and the door hard. Thus he lay\nin wretchedness, afraid to stir, just like a log, and he would\nsend up many a sigh to God.\n\u201cIn winter he suffered very much from the frost. If he stretched\nout his feet they lay bare on the floor and froze, if he gathered\nthem up the blood became all on fire in his legs, and this was\ngreat pain. His feet were full of sores, his legs dropsical, his\nknees bloody and seared, his loins covered with scars from the\nhorsehair, his body wasted, his mouth parched with intense thirst,\nand his hands tremulous from weakness. Amid these torments he\nspent his nights and days; and he endured them all out of the\ngreatness of the love which he bore in his heart to the Divine and\nEternal Wisdom, our Lord Jesus Christ, whose agonizing sufferings\nhe sought to imitate. After a time he gave up this penitential\nexercise of the door, and instead of it he took up his abode in a\nvery small cell, and used the bench, which was so narrow and short\nthat he could not stretch himself upon it, as his bed. In this\nhole, or upon the door, he lay at night in his usual bonds, for\nabout eight years. It was also his custom, during the space of\ntwenty\u2010five years, provided he was staying in the convent, never\nto go after compline in winter into any warm room, or to the\nconvent stove to warm himself, no matter how cold it might be,\nunless he was obliged to do so for other reasons. Throughout all\nthese years he never took a bath, either a water or a sweating\nbath; and this he did in order to mortify his comfort\u2010seeking\nbody. He practiced during a long time such rigid poverty that he\nwould neither receive nor touch a penny, either with leave or\nwithout it. For a considerable time he strove to attain such a\nhigh degree of purity that he would neither scratch nor touch any\npart of his body, save only his hands and feet.\u201d(183)\nI spare you the recital of poor Suso\u2019s self\u2010inflicted tortures from\nthirst. It is pleasant to know that after his fortieth year, God showed\nhim by a series of visions that he had sufficiently broken down the\nnatural man, and that he might leave these exercises off. His case is\ndistinctly pathological, but he does not seem to have had the alleviation,\nwhich some ascetics have enjoyed, of an alteration of sensibility capable\nof actually turning torment into a perverse kind of pleasure. Of the\nfounder of the Sacred Heart order, for example, we read that\n\u201cHer love of pain and suffering was insatiable.... She said that\nshe could cheerfully live till the day of judgment, provided she\nmight always have matter for suffering for God; but that to live a\nsingle day without suffering would be intolerable. She said again\nthat she was devoured with two unassuageable fevers, one for the\nholy communion, the other for suffering, humiliation, and\nannihilation. \u2018Nothing but pain,\u2019 she continually said in her\nletters, \u2018makes my life supportable.\u2019 \u201d(184)\nSo much for the phenomena to which the ascetic impulse will in certain\npersons give rise. In the ecclesiastically consecrated character three\nminor branches of self\u2010mortification have been recognized as indispensable\npathways to perfection. I refer to the chastity, obedience, and poverty\nwhich the monk vows to observe; and upon the heads of obedience and\npoverty I will make a few remarks.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nFirst, of Obedience. The secular life of our twentieth century opens with\nthis virtue held in no high esteem. The duty of the individual to\ndetermine his own conduct and profit or suffer by the consequences seems,\non the contrary, to be one of our best rooted contemporary Protestant\nsocial ideals. So much so that it is difficult even imaginatively to\ncomprehend how men possessed of an inner life of their own could ever have\ncome to think the subjection of its will to that of other finite creatures\nrecommendable. I confess that to myself it seems something of a mystery.\nYet it evidently corresponds to a profound interior need of many persons,\nand we must do our best to understand it.\nOn the lowest possible plane, one sees how the expediency of obedience in\na firm ecclesiastical organization must have led to its being viewed as\nmeritorious. Next, experience shows that there are times in every one\u2019s\nlife when one can be better counseled by others than by one\u2019s self.\nInability to decide is one of the commonest symptoms of fatigued nerves;\nfriends who see our troubles more broadly, often see them more wisely than\nwe do; so it is frequently an act of excellent virtue to consult and obey\na doctor, a partner, or a wife. But, leaving these lower prudential\nregions, we find, in the nature of some of the spiritual excitements which\nwe have been studying, good reasons for idealizing obedience. Obedience\nmay spring from the general religious phenomenon of inner softening and\nself\u2010surrender and throwing one\u2019s self on higher powers. So saving are\nthese attitudes felt to be that in themselves, apart from utility, they\nbecome ideally consecrated; and in obeying a man whose fallibility we see\nthrough thoroughly, we, nevertheless, may feel much as we do when we\nresign our will to that of infinite wisdom. Add self\u2010despair and the\npassion of self\u2010crucifixion to this, and obedience becomes an ascetic\nsacrifice, agreeable quite irrespective of whatever prudential uses it\nmight have.\nIt is as a sacrifice, a mode of \u201cmortification,\u201d that obedience is\nprimarily conceived by Catholic writers, a \u201csacrifice which man offers to\nGod, and of which he is himself both the priest and the victim. By poverty\nhe immolates his exterior possessions; by chastity he immolates his body;\nby obedience he completes the sacrifice, and gives to God all that he yet\nholds as his own, his two most precious goods, his intellect and his will.\nThe sacrifice is then complete and unreserved, a genuine holocaust, for\nthe entire victim is now consumed for the honor of God.\u201d(185) Accordingly,\nin Catholic discipline, we obey our superior not as mere man, but as the\nrepresentative of Christ. Obeying God in him by our intention, obedience\nis easy. But when the text\u2010book theologians marshal collectively all their\nreasons for recommending it, the mixture sounds to our ears rather odd.\n\u201cOne of the great consolations of the monastic life,\u201d says a\nJesuit authority, \u201cis the assurance we have that in obeying we can\ncommit no fault. The Superior may commit a fault in commanding you\nto do this thing or that, but you are certain that you commit no\nfault so long as you obey, because God will only ask you if you\nhave duly performed what orders you received, and if you can\nfurnish a clear account in that respect, you are absolved\nentirely. Whether the things you did were opportune, or whether\nthere were not something better that might have been done, these\nare questions not asked of you, but rather of your Superior. The\nmoment what you did was done obediently, God wipes it out of your\naccount, and charges it to the Superior. So that Saint Jerome well\nexclaimed, in celebrating the advantages of obedience, \u2018Oh,\nsovereign liberty! Oh, holy and blessed security by which one\nbecomes almost impeccable!\u2019\n\u201cSaint John Climachus is of the same sentiment when he calls\nobedience an excuse before God. In fact, when God asks why you\nhave done this or that, and you reply, it is because I was so\nordered by my Superiors, God will ask for no other excuse. As a\npassenger in a good vessel with a good pilot need give himself no\nfarther concern, but may go to sleep in peace, because the pilot\nhas charge over all, and \u2018watches for him\u2019; so a religious person\nwho lives under the yoke of obedience goes to heaven as if while\nsleeping, that is, while leaning entirely on the conduct of his\nSuperiors, who are the pilots of his vessel, and keep watch for\nhim continually. It is no small thing, of a truth, to be able to\ncross the stormy sea of life on the shoulders and in the arms of\nanother, yet that is just the grace which God accords to those who\nlive under the yoke of obedience. Their Superior bears all their\nburdens.... A certain grave doctor said that he would rather spend\nhis life in picking up straws by obedience, than by his own\nresponsible choice busy himself with the loftiest works of\ncharity, because one is certain of following the will of God in\nwhatever one may do from obedience, but never certain in the same\ndegree of anything which we may do of our own proper\nmovement.\u201d(186)\nOne should read the letters in which Ignatius Loyola recommends obedience\nas the backbone of his order, if one would gain insight into the full\nspirit of its cult.(187) They are too long to quote; but Ignatius\u2019s belief\nis so vividly expressed in a couple of sayings reported by companions\nthat, though they have been so often cited, I will ask your permission to\ncopy them once more:\u2014\n\u201cI ought,\u201d an early biographer reports him as saying, \u201con entering\nreligion, and thereafter, to place myself entirely in the hands of\nGod, and of him who takes His place by His authority. I ought to\ndesire that my Superior should oblige me to give up my own\njudgment, and conquer my own mind. I ought to set up no difference\nbetween one Superior and another, ... but recognize them all as\nequal before God, whose place they fill. For if I distinguish\npersons, I weaken the spirit of obedience. In the hands of my\nSuperior, I must be a soft wax, a thing, from which he is to\nrequire whatever pleases him, be it to write or receive letters,\nto speak or not to speak to such a person, or the like; and I must\nput all my fervor in executing zealously and exactly what I am\nordered. I must consider myself as a corpse which has neither\nintelligence nor will; be like a mass of matter which without\nresistance lets itself be placed wherever it may please any one;\nlike a stick in the hand of an old man, who uses it according to\nhis needs and places it where it suits him. So must I be under the\nhands of the Order, to serve it in the way it judges most useful.\n\u201cI must never ask of the Superior to be sent to a particular\nplace, to be employed in a particular duty.... I must consider\nnothing as belonging to me personally, and as regards the things I\nuse, be like a statue which lets itself be stripped and never\nopposes resistance.\u201d(188)\nThe other saying is reported by Rodriguez in the chapter from which I a\nmoment ago made quotations. When speaking of the Pope\u2019s authority,\nRodriguez writes:\u2014\n\u201cSaint Ignatius said, when general of his company, that if the\nHoly Father were to order him to set sail in the first bark which\nhe might find in the port of Ostia, near Rome, and to abandon\nhimself to the sea, without a mast, without sails, without oars or\nrudder or any of the things that are needful for navigation or\nsubsistence, he would obey not only with alacrity, but without\nanxiety or repugnance, and even with a great internal\nsatisfaction.\u201d(189)\nWith a solitary concrete example of the extravagance to which the virtue\nwe are considering has been carried, I will pass to the topic next in\norder.\n\u201cSister Marie Claire [of Port Royal] had been greatly imbued with\nthe holiness and excellence of M. de Langres. This prelate, soon\nafter he came to Port Royal, said to her one day, seeing her so\ntenderly attached to Mother Ang\u00e9lique, that it would perhaps be\nbetter not to speak to her again. Marie Claire, greedy of\nobedience, took this inconsiderate word for an oracle of God, and\nfrom that day forward remained for several years without once\nspeaking to her sister.\u201d(190)\nOur next topic shall be Poverty, felt at all times and under all creeds as\none adornment of a saintly life. Since the instinct of ownership is\nfundamental in man\u2019s nature, this is one more example of the ascetic\nparadox. Yet it appears no paradox at all, but perfectly reasonable, the\nmoment one recollects how easily higher excitements hold lower cupidities\nin check. Having just quoted the Jesuit Rodriguez on the subject of\nobedience, I will, to give immediately a concrete turn to our discussion\nof poverty, also read you a page from his chapter on this latter virtue.\nYou must remember that he is writing instructions for monks of his own\norder, and bases them all on the text, \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit.\u201d\n\u201cIf any one of you,\u201d he says, \u201cwill know whether or not he is\nreally poor in spirit, let him consider whether he loves the\nordinary consequences and effects of poverty, which are hunger,\nthirst, cold, fatigue, and the denudation of all conveniences. See\nif you are glad to wear a worn\u2010out habit full of patches. See if\nyou are glad when something is lacking to your meal, when you are\npassed by in serving it, when what you receive is distasteful to\nyou, when your cell is out of repair. If you are not glad of these\nthings, if instead of loving them you avoid them, then there is\nproof that you have not attained the perfection of poverty of\nspirit.\u201d Rodriguez then goes on to describe the practice of\npoverty in more detail. \u201cThe first point is that which Saint\nIgnatius proposes in his constitutions, when he says, \u2018Let no one\nuse anything as if it were his private possession.\u2019 \u2018A religious\nperson,\u2019 he says, \u2018ought in respect to all the things that he\nuses, to be like a statue which one may drape with clothing, but\nwhich feels no grief and makes no resistance when one strips it\nagain. It is in this way that you should feel towards your\nclothes, your books, your cell, and everything else that you make\nuse of; if ordered to quit them, or to exchange them for others,\nhave no more sorrow than if you were a statue being uncovered. In\nthis way you will avoid using them as if they were your private\npossession. But if, when you give up your cell, or yield\npossession of this or that object or exchange it for another, you\nfeel repugnance and are not like a statue, that shows that you\nview these things as if they were your private property.\u2019\n\u201cAnd this is why our holy founder wished the superiors to test\ntheir monks somewhat as God tested Abraham, and to put their\npoverty and their obedience to trial, that by this means they may\nbecome acquainted with the degree of their virtue, and gain a\nchance to make ever farther progress in perfection, ... making the\none move out of his room when he finds it comfortable and is\nattached to it; taking away from another a book of which he is\nfond; or obliging a third to exchange his garment for a worse one.\nOtherwise we should end by acquiring a species of property in all\nthese several objects, and little by little the wall of poverty\nthat surrounds us and constitutes our principal defense would be\nthrown down. The ancient fathers of the desert used often thus to\ntreat their companions.... Saint Dositheus, being sick\u2010nurse,\ndesired a certain knife, and asked Saint Dorotheus for it, not for\nhis private use, but for employment in the infirmary of which he\nhad charge. Whereupon Saint Dorotheus answered him: \u2018Ha!\nDositheus, so that knife pleases you so much! Will you be the\nslave of a knife or the slave of Jesus Christ? Do you not blush\nwith shame at wishing that a knife should be your master? I will\nnot let you touch it.\u2019 Which reproach and refusal had such an\neffect upon the holy disciple that since that time he never\ntouched the knife again.\u201d ...\n\u201cTherefore, in our rooms,\u201d Father Rodriguez continues, \u201cthere must\nbe no other furniture than a bed, a table, a bench, and a\ncandlestick, things purely necessary, and nothing more. It is not\nallowed among us that our cells should be ornamented with pictures\nor aught else, neither armchairs, carpets, curtains, nor any sort\nof cabinet or bureau of any elegance. Neither is it allowed us to\nkeep anything to eat, either for ourselves or for those who may\ncome to visit us. We must ask permission to go to the refectory\neven for a glass of water; and finally we may not keep a book in\nwhich we can write a line, or which we may take away with us. One\ncannot deny that thus we are in great poverty. But this poverty is\nat the same time a great repose and a great perfection. For it\nwould be inevitable, in case a religious person were allowed to\nown superfluous possessions, that these things would greatly\noccupy his mind, be it to acquire them, to preserve them, or to\nincrease them; so that in not permitting us at all to own them,\nall these inconveniences are remedied. Among the various good\nreasons why the company forbids secular persons to enter our\ncells, the principal one is that thus we may the easier be kept in\npoverty. After all, we are all men, and if we were to receive\npeople of the world into our rooms, we should not have the\nstrength to remain within the bounds prescribed, but should at\nleast wish to adorn them with some books to give the visitors a\nbetter opinion of our scholarship.\u201d(191)\nSince Hindu fakirs, Buddhist monks, and Mohammedan dervishes unite with\nJesuits and Franciscans in idealizing poverty as the loftiest individual\nstate, it is worth while to examine into the spiritual grounds for such a\nseemingly unnatural opinion. And first, of those which lie closest to\ncommon human nature.\nThe opposition between the men who _have_ and the men who _are_ is\nimmemorial. Though the gentleman, in the old\u2010fashioned sense of the man\nwho is well born, has usually in point of fact been predaceous and reveled\nin lands and goods, yet he has never identified his essence with these\npossessions, but rather with the personal superiorities, the courage,\ngenerosity, and pride supposed to be his birthright. To certain\nhuckstering kinds of consideration he thanked God he was forever\ninaccessible, and if in life\u2019s vicissitudes he should become destitute\nthrough their lack, he was glad to think that with his sheer valor he was\nall the freer to work out his salvation. \u201cWer nur selbst was h\u00e4tte,\u201d says\nLessing\u2019s Tempelherr, in Nathan the Wise, \u201cmein Gott, mein Gott, ich habe\nnichts!\u201d This ideal of the well\u2010born man without possessions was embodied\nin knight\u2010errantry and templardom; and, hideously corrupted as it has\nalways been, it still dominates sentimentally, if not practically, the\nmilitary and aristocratic view of life. We glorify the soldier as the man\nabsolutely unencumbered. Owning nothing but his bare life, and willing to\ntoss that up at any moment when the cause commands him, he is the\nrepresentative of unhampered freedom in ideal directions. The laborer who\npays with his person day by day, and has no rights invested in the future,\noffers also much of this ideal detachment. Like the savage, he may make\nhis bed wherever his right arm can support him, and from his simple and\nathletic attitude of observation, the property\u2010owner seems buried and\nsmothered in ignoble externalities and trammels, \u201cwading in straw and\nrubbish to his knees.\u201d The claims which _things_ make are corrupters of\nmanhood, mortgages on the soul, and a drag anchor on our progress towards\nthe empyrean.\n\u201cEverything I meet with,\u201d writes Whitefield, \u201cseems to carry this\nvoice with it,\u2014\u2018Go thou and preach the Gospel; be a pilgrim on\nearth; have no party or certain dwelling place.\u2019 My heart echoes\nback, \u2018Lord Jesus, help me to do or suffer thy will. When thou\nseest me in danger of _nestling_,\u2014in pity\u2014in tender pity,\u2014put a\n_thorn_ in my nest to prevent me from it.\u2019 \u201d(192)\nThe loathing of \u201ccapital\u201d with which our laboring classes to\u2010day are\ngrowing more and more infected seems largely composed of this sound\nsentiment of antipathy for lives based on mere having. As an anarchist\npoet writes:\u2014\n\u201cNot by accumulating riches, but by giving away that which you\nhave,\n\u201cShall you become beautiful;\n\u201cYou must undo the wrappings, not case yourself in fresh ones;\n\u201cNot by multiplying clothes shall you make your body sound and\nhealthy, but rather by discarding them ...\n\u201cFor a soldier who is going on a campaign does not seek what fresh\nfurniture he can carry on his back, but rather what he can leave\nbehind;\n\u201cKnowing well that every additional thing which he cannot freely\nuse and handle is an impediment.\u201d(193)\nIn short, lives based on having are less free than lives based either on\ndoing or on being, and in the interest of action people subject to\nspiritual excitement throw away possessions as so many clogs. Only those\nwho have no private interests can follow an ideal straight away. Sloth and\ncowardice creep in with every dollar or guinea we have to guard. When a\nbrother novice came to Saint Francis, saying: \u201cFather, it would be a great\nconsolation to me to own a psalter, but even supposing that our general\nshould concede to me this indulgence, still I should like also to have\nyour consent,\u201d Francis put him off with the examples of Charlemagne,\nRoland, and Oliver, pursuing the infidels in sweat and labor, and finally\ndying on the field of battle. \u201cSo care not,\u201d he said, \u201cfor owning books\nand knowledge, but care rather for works of goodness.\u201d And when some weeks\nlater the novice came again to talk of his craving for the psalter,\nFrancis said: \u201cAfter you have got your psalter you will crave a breviary;\nand after you have got your breviary you will sit in your stall like a\ngrand prelate, and will say to your brother: \u2018Hand me my breviary.\u2019 ...\nAnd thenceforward he denied all such requests, saying: \u2018A man possesses of\nlearning only so much as comes out of him in action, and a monk is a good\npreacher only so far as his deeds proclaim him such, for every tree is\nknown by its fruits.\u2019 \u201d(194)\nBut beyond this more worthily athletic attitude involved in doing and\nbeing, there is, in the desire of not having, something profounder still,\nsomething related to that fundamental mystery of religious experience, the\nsatisfaction found in absolute surrender to the larger power. So long as\nany secular safeguard is retained, so long as any residual prudential\nguarantee is clung to, so long the surrender is incomplete, the vital\ncrisis is not passed, fear still stands sentinel, and mistrust of the\ndivine obtains: we hold by two anchors, looking to God, it is true, after\na fashion, but also holding by our proper machinations. In certain medical\nexperiences we have the same critical point to overcome. A drunkard, or a\nmorphine or cocaine maniac, offers himself to be cured. He appeals to the\ndoctor to wean him from his enemy, but he dares not face blank abstinence.\nThe tyrannical drug is still an anchor to windward: he hides supplies of\nit among his clothing; arranges secretly to have it smuggled in in case of\nneed. Even so an incompletely regenerate man still trusts in his own\nexpedients. His money is like the sleeping potion which the chronically\nwakeful patient keeps beside his bed; he throws himself on God, but _if_\nhe should need the other help, there it will be also. Every one knows\ncases of this incomplete and ineffective desire for reform,\u2014drunkards\nwhom, with all their self\u2010reproaches and resolves, one perceives to be\nquite unwilling seriously to contemplate _never_ being drunk again! Really\nto give up anything on which we have relied, to give it up definitively,\n\u201cfor good and all\u201d and forever, signifies one of those radical alterations\nof character which came under our notice in the lectures on conversion. In\nit the inner man rolls over into an entirely different position of\nequilibrium, lives in a new centre of energy from this time on, and the\nturning\u2010point and hinge of all such operations seems usually to involve\nthe sincere acceptance of certain nakednesses and destitutions.\nAccordingly, throughout the annals of the saintly life, we find this ever\u2010\nrecurring note: Fling yourself upon God\u2019s providence without making any\nreserve whatever,\u2014take no thought for the morrow,\u2014sell all you have and\ngive it to the poor,\u2014only when the sacrifice is ruthless and reckless will\nthe higher safety really arrive. As a concrete example let me read a page\nfrom the biography of Antoinette Bourignon, a good woman, much persecuted\nin her day by both Protestants and Catholics, because she would not take\nher religion at second hand. When a young girl, in her father\u2019s house,\u2014\n\u201cShe spent whole nights in prayer, oft repeating: _Lord, what wilt\nthou have me to do?_ And being one night in a most profound\npenitence, she said from the bottom of her heart: \u2018O my Lord! What\nmust I do to please thee? For I have nobody to teach me. Speak to\nmy soul and it will hear thee.\u2019 At that instant she heard, as if\nanother had spoke within her: _Forsake all earthly things.\nSeparate thyself from the love of the creatures. Deny thyself._\nShe was quite astonished, not understanding this language, and\nmused long on these three points, thinking how she could fulfill\nthem. She thought she could not live without earthly things, nor\nwithout loving the creatures, nor without loving herself. Yet she\nsaid, \u2018By thy Grace I will do it, Lord!\u2019 But when she would\nperform her promise, she knew not where to begin. Having thought\non the religious in monasteries, that they forsook all earthly\nthings by being shut up in a cloister, and the love of themselves\nby subjecting of their wills, she asked leave of her father to\nenter into a cloister of the barefoot Carmelites, but he would not\npermit it, saying he would rather see her laid in her grave. This\nseemed to her a great cruelty, for she thought to find in the\ncloister the true Christians she had been seeking, but she found\nafterwards that he knew the cloisters better than she; for after\nhe had forbidden her, and told her he would never permit her to be\na religious, nor give her any money to enter there, yet she went\nto Father Laurens, the Director, and offered to serve in the\nmonastery and work hard for her bread, and be content with little,\nif he would receive her. At which he smiled and said: _That cannot\nbe. We must have money to build; we take no maids without money;\nyou must find the way to get it, else there is no entry here._\n\u201cThis astonished her greatly, and she was thereby undeceived as to\nthe cloisters, resolving to forsake all company and live alone\ntill it should please God to show her what she ought to do and\nwhither to go. She asked always earnestly, \u2018When shall I be\nperfectly thine, O my God?\u2019 And she thought he still answered her,\n_When thou shalt no longer possess anything, and shalt die to\nthyself_. \u2018And where shall I do that, Lord?\u2019 He answered her, _In\nthe desert_. This made so strong an impression on her soul that\nshe aspired after this; but being a maid of eighteen years only,\nshe was afraid of unlucky chances, and was never used to travel,\nand knew no way. She laid aside all these doubts and said, \u2018Lord,\nthou wilt guide me how and where it shall please thee. It is for\nthee that I do it. I will lay aside my habit of a maid, and will\ntake that of a hermit that I may pass unknown.\u2019 Having then\nsecretly made ready this habit, while her parents thought to have\nmarried her, her father having promised her to a rich French\nmerchant, she prevented the time, and on Easter evening, having\ncut her hair, put on the habit, and slept a little, she went out\nof her chamber about four in the morning, taking nothing but one\npenny to buy bread for that day. And it being said to her in the\ngoing out, _Where is thy faith? in a penny?_ she threw it away,\nbegging pardon of God for her fault, and saying, \u2018No, Lord, my\nfaith is not in a penny, but in thee alone.\u2019 Thus she went away\nwholly delivered from the heavy burthen of the cares and good\nthings of this world, and found her soul so satisfied that she no\nlonger wished for anything upon earth, resting entirely upon God,\nwith this only fear lest she should be discovered and be obliged\nto return home; for she felt already more content in this poverty\nthan she had done for all her life in all the delights of the\nworld.\u201d(195)\nThe penny was a small financial safeguard, but an effective spiritual\nobstacle. Not till it was thrown away could the character settle into the\nnew equilibrium completely.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOver and above the mystery of self\u2010surrender, there are in the cult of\npoverty other religious mysteries. There is the mystery of veracity:\n\u201cNaked came I into the world,\u201d etc.,\u2014whoever first said that, possessed\nthis mystery. My own bare entity must fight the battle\u2014shams cannot save\nme. There is also the mystery of democracy, or sentiment of the equality\nbefore God of all his creatures. This sentiment (which seems in general to\nhave been more widespread in Mohammedan than in Christian lands) tends to\nnullify man\u2019s usual acquisitiveness. Those who have it spurn dignities and\nhonors, privileges and advantages, preferring, as I said in a former\nlecture, to grovel on the common level before the face of God. It is not\nexactly the sentiment of humility, though it comes so close to it in\npractice. It is _humanity_, rather, refusing to enjoy anything that others\ndo not share. A profound moralist, writing of Christ\u2019s saying, \u201cSell all\nthou hast and follow me,\u201d proceeds as follows:\u2014\n\u201cChrist may have meant: If you love mankind absolutely you will as\na result not care for any possessions whatever, and this seems a\nvery likely proposition. But it is one thing to believe that a\nproposition is probably true; it is another thing to see it as a\nfact. If you loved mankind as Christ loved them, you would see his\nconclusion as a fact. It would be obvious. You would sell your\ngoods, and they would be no loss to you. These truths, while\nliteral to Christ, and to any mind that has Christ\u2019s love for\nmankind, become parables to lesser natures. There are in every\ngeneration people who, beginning innocently, with no predetermined\nintention of becoming saints, find themselves drawn into the\nvortex by their interest in helping mankind, and by the\nunderstanding that comes from actually doing it. The abandonment\nof their old mode of life is like dust in the balance. It is done\ngradually, incidentally, imperceptibly. Thus the whole question of\nthe abandonment of luxury is no question at all, but a mere\nincident to another question, namely, the degree to which we\nabandon ourselves to the remorseless logic of our love for\nothers.\u201d(196)\nBut in all these matters of sentiment one must have \u201cbeen there\u201d one\u2019s\nself in order to understand them. No American can ever attain to\nunderstanding the loyalty of a Briton towards his king, of a German\ntowards his emperor; nor can a Briton or German ever understand the peace\nof heart of an American in having no king, no Kaiser, no spurious\nnonsense, between him and the common God of all. If sentiments as simple\nas these are mysteries which one must receive as gifts of birth, how much\nmore is this the case with those subtler religious sentiments which we\nhave been considering! One can never fathom an emotion or divine its\ndictates by standing outside of it. In the glowing hour of excitement,\nhowever, all incomprehensibilities are solved, and what was so enigmatical\nfrom without becomes transparently obvious. Each emotion obeys a logic of\nits own, and makes deductions which no other logic can draw. Piety and\ncharity live in a different universe from worldly lusts and fears, and\nform another centre of energy altogether. As in a supreme sorrow lesser\nvexations may become a consolation; as a supreme love may turn minor\nsacrifices into gain; so a supreme trust may render common safeguards\nodious, and in certain glows of generous excitement it may appear\nunspeakably mean to retain one\u2019s hold of personal possessions. The only\nsound plan, if we are ourselves outside the pale of such emotions, is to\nobserve as well as we are able those who feel them, and to record\nfaithfully what we observe; and this, I need hardly say, is what I have\nstriven to do in these last two descriptive lectures, which I now hope\nwill have covered the ground sufficiently for our present needs.\nLECTURES XIV AND XV. THE VALUE OF SAINTLINESS.\nWe have now passed in review the more important of the phenomena which are\nregarded as fruits of genuine religion and characteristics of men who are\ndevout. To\u2010day we have to change our attitude from that of description to\nthat of appreciation; we have to ask whether the fruits in question can\nhelp us to judge the absolute value of what religion adds to human life.\nWere I to parody Kant, I should say that a \u201cCritique of pure Saintliness\u201d\nmust be our theme.\nIf, in turning to this theme, we could descend upon our subject from above\nlike Catholic theologians, with our fixed definitions of man and man\u2019s\nperfection and our positive dogmas about God, we should have an easy time\nof it. Man\u2019s perfection would be the fulfillment of his end; and his end\nwould be union with his Maker. That union could be pursued by him along\nthree paths, active, purgative, and contemplative, respectively; and\nprogress along either path would be a simple matter to measure by the\napplication of a limited number of theological and moral conceptions and\ndefinitions. The absolute significance and value of any bit of religious\nexperience we might hear of would thus be given almost mathematically into\nour hands.\nIf convenience were everything, we ought now to grieve at finding\nourselves cut off from so admirably convenient a method as this. But we\ndid cut ourselves off from it deliberately in those remarks which you\nremember we made, in our first lecture, about the empirical method; and it\nmust be confessed that after that act of renunciation we can never hope\nfor clean\u2010cut and scholastic results. _We_ cannot divide man sharply into\nan animal and a rational part. _We_ cannot distinguish natural from\nsupernatural effects; nor among the latter know which are favors of God,\nand which are counterfeit operations of the demon. We have merely to\ncollect things together without any special _a priori_ theological system,\nand out of an aggregate of piecemeal judgments as to the value of this and\nthat experience\u2014judgments in which our general philosophic prejudices, our\ninstincts, and our common sense are our only guides\u2014decide that _on the\nwhole_ one type of religion is approved by its fruits, and another type\ncondemned. \u201cOn the whole,\u201d\u2014I fear we shall never escape complicity with\nthat qualification, so dear to your practical man, so repugnant to your\nsystematizer!\nI also fear that as I make this frank confession, I may seem to some of\nyou to throw our compass overboard, and to adopt caprice as our pilot.\nSkepticism or wayward choice, you may think, can be the only results of\nsuch a formless method as I have taken up. A few remarks in deprecation of\nsuch an opinion, and in farther explanation of the empiricist principles\nwhich I profess, may therefore appear at this point to be in place.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nAbstractly, it would seem illogical to try to measure the worth of a\nreligion\u2019s fruits in merely human terms of value. How _can_ you measure\ntheir worth without considering whether the God really exists who is\nsupposed to inspire them? If he really exists, then all the conduct\ninstituted by men to meet his wants must necessarily be a reasonable fruit\nof his religion,\u2014it would be unreasonable only in case he did not exist.\nIf, for instance, you were to condemn a religion of human or animal\nsacrifices by virtue of your subjective sentiments, and if all the while a\ndeity were really there demanding such sacrifices, you would be making a\ntheoretical mistake by tacitly assuming that the deity must be non\u2010\nexistent; you would be setting up a theology of your own as much as if you\nwere a scholastic philosopher.\nTo this extent, to the extent of disbelieving peremptorily in certain\ntypes of deity, I frankly confess that we must be theologians. If\ndisbeliefs can be said to constitute a theology, then the prejudices,\ninstincts, and common sense which I chose as our guides make theological\npartisans of us whenever they make certain beliefs abhorrent.\nBut such common\u2010sense prejudices and instincts are themselves the fruit of\nan empirical evolution. Nothing is more striking than the secular\nalteration that goes on in the moral and religious tone of men, as their\ninsight into nature and their social arrangements progressively develop.\nAfter an interval of a few generations the mental climate proves\nunfavorable to notions of the deity which at an earlier date were\nperfectly satisfactory: the older gods have fallen below the common\nsecular level, and can no longer be believed in. To\u2010day a deity who should\nrequire bleeding sacrifices to placate him would be too sanguinary to be\ntaken seriously. Even if powerful historical credentials were put forward\nin his favor, we would not look at them. Once, on the contrary, his cruel\nappetites were of themselves credentials. They positively recommended him\nto men\u2019s imaginations in ages when such coarse signs of power were\nrespected and no others could be understood. Such deities then were\nworshiped because such fruits were relished.\nDoubtless historic accidents always played some later part, but the\noriginal factor in fixing the figure of the gods must always have been\npsychological. The deity to whom the prophets, seers, and devotees who\nfounded the particular cult bore witness was worth something to them\npersonally. They could use him. He guided their imagination, warranted\ntheir hopes, and controlled their will,\u2014or else they required him as a\nsafeguard against the demon and a curber of other people\u2019s crimes. In any\ncase, they chose him for the value of the fruits he seemed to them to\nyield. So soon as the fruits began to seem quite worthless; so soon as\nthey conflicted with indispensable human ideals, or thwarted too\nextensively other values; so soon as they appeared childish, contemptible,\nor immoral when reflected on, the deity grew discredited, and was erelong\nneglected and forgotten. It was in this way that the Greek and Roman gods\nceased to be believed in by educated pagans; it is thus that we ourselves\njudge of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Mohammedan theologies; Protestants have\nso dealt with the Catholic notions of deity, and liberal Protestants with\nolder Protestant notions; it is thus that Chinamen judge of us, and that\nall of us now living will be judged by our descendants. When we cease to\nadmire or approve what the definition of a deity implies, we end by\ndeeming that deity incredible.\nFew historic changes are more curious than these mutations of theological\nopinion. The monarchical type of sovereignty was, for example, so\nineradicably planted in the mind of our own forefathers that a dose of\ncruelty and arbitrariness in their deity seems positively to have been\nrequired by their imagination. They called the cruelty \u201cretributive\njustice,\u201d and a God without it would certainly have struck them as not\n\u201csovereign\u201d enough. But to\u2010day we abhor the very notion of eternal\nsuffering inflicted; and that arbitrary dealing\u2010out of salvation and\ndamnation to selected individuals, of which Jonathan Edwards could\npersuade himself that he had not only a conviction, but a \u201cdelightful\nconviction,\u201d as of a doctrine \u201cexceeding pleasant, bright, and sweet,\u201d\nappears to us, if sovereignly anything, sovereignly irrational and mean.\nNot only the cruelty, but the paltriness of character of the gods believed\nin by earlier centuries also strikes later centuries with surprise. We\nshall see examples of it from the annals of Catholic saintship which make\nus rub our Protestant eyes. Ritual worship in general appears to the\nmodern transcendentalist, as well as to the ultra\u2010puritanic type of mind,\nas if addressed to a deity of an almost absurdly childish character,\ntaking delight in toy\u2010shop furniture, tapers and tinsel, costume and\nmumbling and mummery, and finding his \u201cglory\u201d incomprehensibly enhanced\nthereby;\u2014just as on the other hand the formless spaciousness of pantheism\nappears quite empty to ritualistic natures, and the gaunt theism of\nevangelical sects seems intolerably bald and chalky and bleak. Luther,\nsays Emerson, would have cut off his right hand rather than nail his\ntheses to the door at Wittenberg, if he had supposed that they were\ndestined to lead to the pale negations of Boston Unitarianism.\nSo far, then, although we are compelled, whatever may be our pretensions\nto empiricism, to employ some sort of a standard of theological\nprobability of our own whenever we assume to estimate the fruits of other\nmen\u2019s religion, yet this very standard has been begotten out of the drift\nof common life. It is the voice of human experience within us, judging and\ncondemning all gods that stand athwart the pathway along which it feels\nitself to be advancing. Experience, if we take it in the largest sense, is\nthus the parent of those disbeliefs which, it was charged, were\ninconsistent with the experiential method. The inconsistency, you see, is\nimmaterial, and the charge may be neglected.\nIf we pass from disbeliefs to positive beliefs, it seems to me that there\nis not even a formal inconsistency to be laid against our method. The gods\nwe stand by are the gods we need and can use, the gods whose demands on us\nare reinforcements of our demands on ourselves and on one another. What I\nthen propose to do is, briefly stated, to test saintliness by common\nsense, to use human standards to help us decide how far the religious life\ncommends itself as an ideal kind of human activity. If it commends itself,\nthen any theological beliefs that may inspire it, in so far forth will\nstand accredited. If not, then they will be discredited, and all without\nreference to anything but human working principles. It is but the\nelimination of the humanly unfit, and the survival of the humanly fittest,\napplied to religious beliefs; and if we look at history candidly and\nwithout prejudice, we have to admit that no religion has ever in the long\nrun established or proved itself in any other way. Religions have\n_approved_ themselves; they have ministered to sundry vital needs which\nthey found reigning. When they violated other needs too strongly, or when\nother faiths came which served the same needs better, the first religions\nwere supplanted.\nThe needs were always many, and the tests were never sharp. So the\nreproach of vagueness and subjectivity and \u201con the whole\u201d\u2010ness, which can\nwith perfect legitimacy be addressed to the empirical method as we are\nforced to use it, is after all a reproach to which the entire life of man\nin dealing with these matters is obnoxious. No religion has ever yet owed\nits prevalence to \u201capodictic certainty.\u201d In a later lecture I will ask\nwhether objective certainty can ever be added by theological reasoning to\na religion that already empirically prevails.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOne word, also, about the reproach that in following this sort of an\nempirical method we are handing ourselves over to systematic skepticism.\nSince it is impossible to deny secular alterations in our sentiments and\nneeds, it would be absurd to affirm that one\u2019s own age of the world can be\nbeyond correction by the next age. Skepticism cannot, therefore, be ruled\nout by any set of thinkers as a possibility against which their\nconclusions are secure; and no empiricist ought to claim exemption from\nthis universal liability. But to admit one\u2019s liability to correction is\none thing, and to embark upon a sea of wanton doubt is another. Of\nwillfully playing into the hands of skepticism we cannot be accused. He\nwho acknowledges the imperfectness of his instrument, and makes allowance\nfor it in discussing his observations, is in a much better position for\ngaining truth than if he claimed his instrument to be infallible. Or is\ndogmatic or scholastic theology less doubted in point of fact for\nclaiming, as it does, to be in point of right undoubtable? And if not,\nwhat command over truth would this kind of theology really lose if,\ninstead of absolute certainty, she only claimed reasonable probability for\nher conclusions? If _we_ claim only reasonable probability, it will be as\nmuch as men who love the truth can ever at any given moment hope to have\nwithin their grasp. Pretty surely it will be more than we could have had,\nif we were unconscious of our liability to err.\nNevertheless, dogmatism will doubtless continue to condemn us for this\nconfession. The mere outward form of inalterable certainty is so precious\nto some minds that to renounce it explicitly is for them out of the\nquestion. They will claim it even where the facts most patently pronounce\nits folly. But the safe thing is surely to recognize that all the insights\nof creatures of a day like ourselves must be provisional. The wisest of\ncritics is an altering being, subject to the better insight of the morrow,\nand right at any moment, only \u201cup to date\u201d and \u201con the whole.\u201d When larger\nranges of truth open, it is surely best to be able to open ourselves to\ntheir reception, unfettered by our previous pretensions. \u201cHeartily know,\nwhen half\u2010gods go, the gods arrive.\u201d\nThe fact of diverse judgments about religious phenomena is therefore\nentirely unescapable, whatever may be one\u2019s own desire to attain the\nirreversible. But apart from that fact, a more fundamental question awaits\nus, the question whether men\u2019s opinions ought to be expected to be\nabsolutely uniform in this field. Ought all men to have the same religion?\nOught they to approve the same fruits and follow the same leadings? Are\nthey so like in their inner needs that, for hard and soft, for proud and\nhumble, for strenuous and lazy, for healthy\u2010minded and despairing, exactly\nthe same religious incentives are required? Or are different functions in\nthe organism of humanity allotted to different types of man, so that some\nmay really be the better for a religion of consolation and reassurance,\nwhilst others are better for one of terror and reproof? It might\nconceivably be so; and we shall, I think, more and more suspect it to be\nso as we go on. And if it be so, how can any possible judge or critic help\nbeing biased in favor of the religion by which his own needs are best met?\nHe aspires to impartiality; but he is too close to the struggle not to be\nto some degree a participant, and he is sure to approve most warmly those\nfruits of piety in others which taste most good and prove most nourishing\nto _him_.\nI am well aware of how anarchic much of what I say may sound. Expressing\nmyself thus abstractly and briefly, I may seem to despair of the very\nnotion of truth. But I beseech you to reserve your judgment until we see\nit applied to the details which lie before us. I do indeed disbelieve that\nwe or any other mortal men can attain on a given day to absolutely\nincorrigible and unimprovable truth about such matters of fact as those\nwith which religions deal. But I reject this dogmatic ideal not out of a\nperverse delight in intellectual instability. I am no lover of disorder\nand doubt as such. Rather do I fear to lose truth by this pretension to\npossess it already wholly. That we can gain more and more of it by moving\nalways in the right direction, I believe as much as any one, and I hope to\nbring you all to my way of thinking before the termination of these\nlectures. Till then, do not, I pray you, harden your minds irrevocably\nagainst the empiricism which I profess.\nI will waste no more words, then, in abstract justification of my method,\nbut seek immediately to use it upon the facts.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn critically judging of the value of religious phenomena, it is very\nimportant to insist on the distinction between religion as an individual\npersonal function, and religion as an institutional, corporate, or tribal\nproduct. I drew this distinction, you may remember, in my second lecture.\nThe word \u201creligion,\u201d as ordinarily used, is equivocal. A survey of history\nshows us that, as a rule, religious geniuses attract disciples, and\nproduce groups of sympathizers. When these groups get strong enough to\n\u201corganize\u201d themselves, they become ecclesiastical institutions with\ncorporate ambitions of their own. The spirit of politics and the lust of\ndogmatic rule are then apt to enter and to contaminate the originally\ninnocent thing; so that when we hear the word \u201creligion\u201d nowadays, we\nthink inevitably of some \u201cchurch\u201d or other; and to some persons the word\n\u201cchurch\u201d suggests so much hypocrisy and tyranny and meanness and tenacity\nof superstition that in a wholesale undiscerning way they glory in saying\nthat they are \u201cdown\u201d on religion altogether. Even we who belong to\nchurches do not exempt other churches than our own from the general\ncondemnation.\nBut in this course of lectures ecclesiastical institutions hardly concern\nus at all. The religious experience which we are studying is that which\nlives itself out within the private breast. First\u2010hand individual\nexperience of this kind has always appeared as a heretical sort of\ninnovation to those who witnessed its birth. Naked comes it into the world\nand lonely; and it has always, for a time at least, driven him who had it\ninto the wilderness, often into the literal wilderness out of doors, where\nthe Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, St. Francis, George Fox, and so many others\nhad to go. George Fox expresses well this isolation; and I can do no\nbetter at this point than read to you a page from his Journal, referring\nto the period of his youth when religion began to ferment within him\nseriously.\n\u201cI fasted much,\u201d Fox says, \u201cwalked abroad in solitary places many\ndays, and often took my Bible, and sat in hollow trees and\nlonesome places until night came on; and frequently in the night\nwalked mournfully about by myself; for I was a man of sorrows in\nthe time of the first workings of the Lord in me.\n\u201cDuring all this time I was never joined in profession of religion\nwith any, but gave up myself to the Lord, having forsaken all evil\ncompany, taking leave of father and mother, and all other\nrelations, and traveled up and down as a stranger on the earth,\nwhich way the Lord inclined my heart; taking a chamber to myself\nin the town where I came, and tarrying sometimes more, sometimes\nless in a place: for I durst not stay long in a place, being\nafraid both of professor and profane, lest, being a tender young\nman, I should be hurt by conversing much with either. For which\nreason I kept much as a stranger, seeking heavenly wisdom and\ngetting knowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from outward\nthings, to rely on the Lord alone. As I had forsaken the priests,\nso I left the separate preachers also, and those called the most\nexperienced people; for I saw there was none among them all that\ncould speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in\nall men were gone so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor\ncould tell what to do; then, oh then, I heard a voice which said,\n\u2018There is one, even Jesus Christ, that can speak to thy\ncondition.\u2019 When I heard it, my heart did leap for joy. Then the\nLord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak\nto my condition. I had not fellowship with any people, priests,\nnor professors, nor any sort of separated people. I was afraid of\nall carnal talk and talkers, for I could see nothing but\ncorruptions. When I was in the deep, under all shut up, I could\nnot believe that I should ever overcome; my troubles, my sorrows,\nand my temptations were so great that I often thought I should\nhave despaired, I was so tempted. But when Christ opened to me how\nhe was tempted by the same devil, and had overcome him, and had\nbruised his head; and that through him and his power, life, grace,\nand spirit, I should overcome also, I had confidence in him. If I\nhad had a king\u2019s diet, palace, and attendance, all would have been\nas nothing; for nothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power.\nI saw professors, priests, and people were whole and at ease in\nthat condition which was my misery, and they loved that which I\nwould have been rid of. But the Lord did stay my desires upon\nhimself, and my care was cast upon him alone.\u201d(197)\nA genuine first\u2010hand religious experience like this is bound to be a\nheterodoxy to its witnesses, the prophet appearing as a mere lonely\nmadman. If his doctrine prove contagious enough to spread to any others,\nit becomes a definite and labeled heresy. But if it then still prove\ncontagious enough to triumph over persecution, it becomes itself an\northodoxy; and when a religion has become an orthodoxy, its day of\ninwardness is over: the spring is dry; the faithful live at second hand\nexclusively and stone the prophets in their turn. The new church, in spite\nof whatever human goodness it may foster, can be henceforth counted on as\na staunch ally in every attempt to stifle the spontaneous religious\nspirit, and to stop all later bubblings of the fountain from which in\npurer days it drew its own supply of inspiration. Unless, indeed, by\nadopting new movements of the spirit it can make capital out of them and\nuse them for its selfish corporate designs! Of protective action of this\npolitic sort, promptly or tardily decided on, the dealings of the Roman\necclesiasticism with many individual saints and prophets yield examples\nenough for our instruction.\nThe plain fact is that men\u2019s minds are built, as has been often said, in\nwater\u2010tight compartments. Religious after a fashion, they yet have many\nother things in them beside their religion, and unholy entanglements and\nassociations inevitably obtain. The basenesses so commonly charged to\nreligion\u2019s account are thus, almost all of them, not chargeable at all to\nreligion proper, but rather to religion\u2019s wicked practical partner, the\nspirit of corporate dominion. And the bigotries are most of them in their\nturn chargeable to religion\u2019s wicked intellectual partner, the spirit of\ndogmatic dominion, the passion for laying down the law in the form of an\nabsolutely closed\u2010in theoretic system. The ecclesiastical spirit in\ngeneral is the sum of these two spirits of dominion; and I beseech you\nnever to confound the phenomena of mere tribal or corporate psychology\nwhich it presents with those manifestations of the purely interior life\nwhich are the exclusive object of our study. The baiting of Jews, the\nhunting of Albigenses and Waldenses, the stoning of Quakers and ducking of\nMethodists, the murdering of Mormons and the massacring of Armenians,\nexpress much rather that aboriginal human neophobia, that pugnacity of\nwhich we all share the vestiges, and that inborn hatred of the alien and\nof eccentric and non\u2010conforming men as aliens, than they express the\npositive piety of the various perpetrators. Piety is the mask, the inner\nforce is tribal instinct. You believe as little as I do, in spite of the\nChristian unction with which the German emperor addressed his troops upon\ntheir way to China, that the conduct which he suggested, and in which\nother Christian armies went beyond them, had anything whatever to do with\nthe interior religious life of those concerned in the performance.\nWell, no more for past atrocities than for this atrocity should we make\npiety responsible. At most we may blame piety for not availing to check\nour natural passions, and sometimes for supplying them with hypocritical\npretexts. But hypocrisy also imposes obligations, and with the pretext\nusually couples some restriction; and when the passion gust is over, the\npiety may bring a reaction of repentance which the irreligious natural man\nwould not have shown.\nFor many of the historic aberrations which have been laid to her charge,\nreligion as such, then, is not to blame. Yet of the charge that over\u2010\nzealousness or fanaticism is one of her liabilities we cannot wholly\nacquit her, so I will next make a remark upon that point. But I will\npreface it by a preliminary remark which connects itself with much that\nfollows.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOur survey of the phenomena of saintliness has unquestionably produced in\nyour minds an impression of extravagance. Is it necessary, some of you\nhave asked, as one example after another came before us, to be quite so\nfantastically good as that? We who have no vocation for the extremer\nranges of sanctity will surely be let off at the last day if our humility,\nasceticism, and devoutness prove of a less convulsive sort. This\npractically amounts to saying that much that it is legitimate to admire in\nthis field need nevertheless not be imitated, and that religious\nphenomena, like all other human phenomena, are subject to the law of the\ngolden mean. Political reformers accomplish their successive tasks in the\nhistory of nations by being blind for the time to other causes. Great\nschools of art work out the effects which it is their mission to reveal,\nat the cost of a one\u2010sidedness for which other schools must make amends.\nWe accept a John Howard, a Mazzini, a Botticelli, a Michael Angelo, with a\nkind of indulgence. We are glad they existed to show us that way, but we\nare glad there are also other ways of seeing and taking life. So of many\nof the saints whom we have looked at. We are proud of a human nature that\ncould be so passionately extreme, but we shrink from advising others to\nfollow the example. The conduct we blame ourselves for not following lies\nnearer to the middle line of human effort. It is less dependent on\nparticular beliefs and doctrines. It is such as wears well in different\nages, such as under different skies all judges are able to commend.\nThe fruits of religion, in other words, are, like all human products,\nliable to corruption by excess. Common sense must judge them. It need not\nblame the votary; but it may be able to praise him only conditionally, as\none who acts faithfully according to his lights. He shows us heroism in\none way, but the unconditionally good way is that for which no indulgence\nneed be asked.\nWe find that error by excess is exemplified by every saintly virtue.\nExcess, in human faculties, means usually one\u2010sidedness or want of\nbalance; for it is hard to imagine an essential faculty too strong, if\nonly other faculties equally strong be there to co\u00f6perate with it in\naction. Strong affections need a strong will; strong active powers need a\nstrong intellect; strong intellect needs strong sympathies, to keep life\nsteady. If the balance exist, no one faculty can possibly be too strong\u2014we\nonly get the stronger all\u2010round character. In the life of saints,\ntechnically so called, the spiritual faculties are strong, but what gives\nthe impression of extravagance proves usually on examination to be a\nrelative deficiency of intellect. Spiritual excitement takes pathological\nforms whenever other interests are too few and the intellect too narrow.\nWe find this exemplified by all the saintly attributes in turn\u2014devout love\nof God, purity, charity, asceticism, all may lead astray. I will run over\nthese virtues in succession.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nFirst of all let us take Devoutness. When unbalanced, one of its vices is\ncalled Fanaticism. Fanaticism (when not a mere expression of\necclesiastical ambition) is only loyalty carried to a convulsive extreme.\nWhen an intensely loyal and narrow mind is once grasped by the feeling\nthat a certain superhuman person is worthy of its exclusive devotion, one\nof the first things that happens is that it idealizes the devotion itself.\nTo adequately realize the merits of the idol gets to be considered the one\ngreat merit of the worshiper; and the sacrifices and servilities by which\nsavage tribesmen have from time immemorial exhibited their faithfulness to\nchieftains are now outbid in favor of the deity. Vocabularies are\nexhausted and languages altered in the attempt to praise him enough; death\nis looked on as gain if it attract his grateful notice; and the personal\nattitude of being his devotee becomes what one might almost call a new and\nexalted kind of professional specialty within the tribe.(198) The legends\nthat gather round the lives of holy persons are fruits of this impulse to\ncelebrate and glorify. The Buddha(199) and Mohammed(200) and their\ncompanions and many Christian saints are incrusted with a heavy jewelry of\nanecdotes which are meant to be honorific, but are simply _abgeschmackt_\nand silly, and form a touching expression of man\u2019s misguided propensity to\npraise.\nAn immediate consequence of this condition of mind is jealousy for the\ndeity\u2019s honor. How can the devotee show his loyalty better than by\nsensitiveness in this regard? The slightest affront or neglect must be\nresented, the deity\u2019s enemies must be put to shame. In exceedingly narrow\nminds and active wills, such a care may become an engrossing\npreoccupation; and crusades have been preached and massacres instigated\nfor no other reason than to remove a fancied slight upon the God.\nTheologies representing the gods as mindful of their glory, and churches\nwith imperialistic policies, have conspired to fan this temper to a glow,\nso that intolerance and persecution have come to be vices associated by\nsome of us inseparably with the saintly mind. They are unquestionably its\nbesetting sins. The saintly temper is a moral temper, and a moral temper\nhas often to be cruel. It is a partisan temper, and that is cruel. Between\nhis own and Jehovah\u2019s enemies a David knows no difference; a Catherine of\nSiena, panting to stop the warfare among Christians which was the scandal\nof her epoch, can think of no better method of union among them than a\ncrusade to massacre the Turks; Luther finds no word of protest or regret\nover the atrocious tortures with which the Anabaptist leaders were put to\ndeath; and a Cromwell praises the Lord for delivering his enemies into his\nhands for \u201cexecution.\u201d Politics come in in all such cases; but piety finds\nthe partnership not quite unnatural. So, when \u201cfreethinkers\u201d tell us that\nreligion and fanaticism are twins, we cannot make an unqualified denial of\nthe charge.\nFanaticism must then be inscribed on the wrong side of religion\u2019s account,\nso long as the religious person\u2019s intellect is on the stage which the\ndespotic kind of God satisfies. But as soon as the God is represented as\nless intent on his own honor and glory, it ceases to be a danger.\nFanaticism is found only where the character is masterful and aggressive.\nIn gentle characters, where devoutness is intense and the intellect\nfeeble, we have an imaginative absorption in the love of God to the\nexclusion of all practical human interests, which, though innocent enough,\nis too one\u2010sided to be admirable. A mind too narrow has room but for one\nkind of affection. When the love of God takes possession of such a mind,\nit expels all human loves and human uses. There is no English name for\nsuch a sweet excess of devotion, so I will refer to it as a _theopathic_\ncondition.\nThe blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque may serve as an example.\n\u201cTo be loved here upon the earth,\u201d her recent biographer exclaims:\n\u201cto be loved by a noble, elevated, distinguished being; to be\nloved with fidelity, with devotion,\u2014what enchantment! But to be\nloved by God! and loved by him to distraction [aim\u00e9 jusq\u00f9\u2019\u00e0 la\nfolie]!\u2014Margaret melted away with love at the thought of such a\nthing. Like Saint Philip of Neri in former times, or like Saint\nFrancis Xavier, she said to God: \u2018Hold back, O my God, these\ntorrents which overwhelm me, or else enlarge my capacity for their\nreception.\u2019 \u201d(201)\nThe most signal proofs of God\u2019s love which Margaret Mary received\nwere her hallucinations of sight, touch, and hearing, and the most\nsignal in turn of these were the revelations of Christ\u2019s sacred\nheart, \u201csurrounded with rays more brilliant than the Sun, and\ntransparent like a crystal. The wound which he received on the\ncross visibly appeared upon it. There was a crown of thorns round\nabout this divine Heart, and a cross above it.\u201d At the same time\nChrist\u2019s voice told her that, unable longer to contain the flames\nof his love for mankind, he had chosen her by a miracle to spread\nthe knowledge of them. He thereupon took out her mortal heart,\nplaced it inside of his own and inflamed it, and then replaced it\nin her breast, adding: \u201cHitherto thou hast taken the name of my\nslave, hereafter thou shalt be called the well\u2010beloved disciple of\nmy Sacred Heart.\u201d\nIn a later vision the Saviour revealed to her in detail the \u201cgreat\ndesign\u201d which he wished to establish through her instrumentality.\n\u201cI ask of thee to bring it about that every first Friday after the\nweek of holy Sacrament shall be made into a special holy day for\nhonoring my Heart by a general communion and by services intended\nto make honorable amends for the indignities which it has\nreceived. And I promise thee that my Heart will dilate to shed\nwith abundance the influences of its love upon all those who pay\nto it these honors, or who bring it about that others do the\nsame.\u201d\n\u201cThis revelation,\u201d says Mgr. Bougaud, \u201cis unquestionably the most\nimportant of all the revelations which have illumined the Church since\nthat of the Incarnation and of the Lord\u2019s Supper.... After the Eucharist,\nthe supreme effort of the Sacred Heart.\u201d(202) Well, what were its good\nfruits for Margaret Mary\u2019s life? Apparently little else but sufferings and\nprayers and absences of mind and swoons and ecstasies. She became\nincreasingly useless about the convent, her absorption in Christ\u2019s love,\u2014\n\u201cwhich grew upon her daily, rendering her more and more incapable\nof attending to external duties. They tried her in the infirmary,\nbut without much success, although her kindness, zeal, and\ndevotion were without bounds, and her charity rose to acts of such\na heroism that our readers would not bear the recital of them.\nThey tried her in the kitchen, but were forced to give it up as\nhopeless\u2014everything dropped out of her hands. The admirable\nhumility with which she made amends for her clumsiness could not\nprevent this from being prejudicial to the order and regularity\nwhich must always reign in a community. They put her in the\nschool, where the little girls cherished her, and cut pieces out\nof her clothes [for relics] as if she were already a saint, but\nwhere she was too absorbed inwardly to pay the necessary\nattention. Poor dear sister, even less after her visions than\nbefore them was she a denizen of earth, and they had to leave her\nin her heaven.\u201d(203)\nPoor dear sister, indeed! Amiable and good, but so feeble of intellectual\noutlook that it would be too much to ask of us, with our Protestant and\nmodern education, to feel anything but indulgent pity for the kind of\nsaintship which she embodies. A lower example still of theopathic\nsaintliness is that of Saint Gertrude, a Benedictine nun of the thirteenth\ncentury, whose \u201cRevelations,\u201d a well\u2010known mystical authority, consist\nmainly of proofs of Christ\u2019s partiality for her undeserving person.\nAssurances of his love, intimacies and caresses and compliments of the\nmost absurd and puerile sort, addressed by Christ to Gertrude as an\nindividual, form the tissue of this paltry\u2010minded recital.(204) In reading\nsuch a narrative, we realize the gap between the thirteenth and the\ntwentieth century, and we feel that saintliness of character may yield\nalmost absolutely worthless fruits if it be associated with such inferior\nintellectual sympathies. What with science, idealism, and democracy, our\nown imagination has grown to need a God of an entirely different\ntemperament from that Being interested exclusively in dealing out personal\nfavors, with whom our ancestors were so contented. Smitten as we are with\nthe vision of social righteousness, a God indifferent to everything but\nadulation, and full of partiality for his individual favorites, lacks an\nessential element of largeness; and even the best professional sainthood\nof former centuries, pent in as it is to such a conception, seems to us\ncuriously shallow and unedifying.\nTake Saint Teresa, for example, one of the ablest women, in many respects,\nof whose life we have the record. She had a powerful intellect of the\npractical order. She wrote admirable descriptive psychology, possessed a\nwill equal to any emergency, great talent for politics and business, a\nbuoyant disposition, and a first\u2010rate literary style. She was tenaciously\naspiring, and put her whole life at the service of her religious ideals.\nYet so paltry were these, according to our present way of thinking, that\n(although I know that others have been moved differently) I confess that\nmy only feeling in reading her has been pity that so much vitality of soul\nshould have found such poor employment.\nIn spite of the sufferings which she endured, there is a curious flavor of\nsuperficiality about her genius. A Birmingham anthropologist, Dr. Jordan,\nhas divided the human race into two types, whom he calls \u201cshrews\u201d and\n\u201cnon\u2010shrews\u201d respectively.(205) The shrew\u2010type is defined as possessing an\n\u201cactive unimpassioned temperament.\u201d In other words, shrews are the\n\u201cmotors,\u201d rather than the \u201csensories,\u201d(206) and their expressions are as a\nrule more energetic than the feelings which appear to prompt them. Saint\nTeresa, paradoxical as such a judgment may sound, was a typical shrew, in\nthis sense of the term. The bustle of her style, as well as of her life,\nproves it. Not only must she receive unheard\u2010of personal favors and\nspiritual graces from her Saviour, but she must immediately write about\nthem and _exploiter_ them professionally, and use her expertness to give\ninstruction to those less privileged. Her voluble egotism; her sense, not\nof radical bad being, as the really contrite have it, but of her \u201cfaults\u201d\nand \u201cimperfections\u201d in the plural; her stereotyped humility and return\nupon herself, as covered with \u201cconfusion\u201d at each new manifestation of\nGod\u2019s singular partiality for a person so unworthy, are typical of\nshrewdom: a paramountly feeling nature would be objectively lost in\ngratitude, and silent. She had some public instincts, it is true; she\nhated the Lutherans, and longed for the church\u2019s triumph over them; but in\nthe main her idea of religion seems to have been that of an endless\namatory flirtation\u2014if one may say so without irreverence\u2014between the\ndevotee and the deity; and apart from helping younger nuns to go in this\ndirection by the inspiration of her example and instruction, there is\nabsolutely no human use in her, or sign of any general human interest. Yet\nthe spirit of her age, far from rebuking her, exalted her as superhuman.\nWe have to pass a similar judgment on the whole notion of saintship based\non merits. Any God who, on the one hand, can care to keep a pedantically\nminute account of individual shortcomings, and on the other can feel such\npartialities, and load particular creatures with such insipid marks of\nfavor, is too small\u2010minded a God for our credence. When Luther, in his\nimmense manly way, swept off by a stroke of his hand the very notion of a\ndebit and credit account kept with individuals by the Almighty, he\nstretched the soul\u2019s imagination and saved theology from puerility.\nSo much for mere devotion, divorced from the intellectual conceptions\nwhich might guide it towards bearing useful human fruit.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next saintly virtue in which we find excess is Purity. In theopathic\ncharacters, like those whom we have just considered, the love of God must\nnot be mixed with any other love. Father and mother, sisters, brothers,\nand friends are felt as interfering distractions; for sensitiveness and\nnarrowness, when they occur together, as they often do, require above all\nthings a simplified world to dwell in. Variety and confusion are too much\nfor their powers of comfortable adaptation. But whereas your aggressive\npietist reaches his unity objectively, by forcibly stamping disorder and\ndivergence out, your retiring pietist reaches his subjectively, leaving\ndisorder in the world at large, but making a smaller world in which he\ndwells himself and from which he eliminates it altogether. Thus, alongside\nof the church militant with its prisons, dragonnades, and inquisition\nmethods, we have the church _fugient_, as one might call it, with its\nhermitages, monasteries, and sectarian organizations, both churches\npursuing the same object\u2014to unify the life,(207) and simplify the\nspectacle presented to the soul. A mind extremely sensitive to inner\ndiscords will drop one external relation after another, as interfering\nwith the absorption of consciousness in spiritual things. Amusements must\ngo first, then conventional \u201csociety,\u201d then business, then family duties,\nuntil at last seclusion, with a subdivision of the day into hours for\nstated religious acts, is the only thing that can be borne. The lives of\nsaints are a history of successive renunciations of complication, one form\nof contact with the outer life being dropped after another, to save the\npurity of inner tone.(208) \u201cIs it not better,\u201d a young sister asks her\nSuperior, \u201cthat I should not speak at all during the hour of recreation,\nso as not to run the risk, by speaking, of falling into some sin of which\nI might not be conscious?\u201d(209) If the life remains a social one at all,\nthose who take part in it must follow one identical rule. Embosomed in\nthis monotony, the zealot for purity feels clean and free once more. The\nminuteness of uniformity maintained in certain sectarian communities,\nwhether monastic or not, is something almost inconceivable to a man of the\nworld. Costume, phraseology, hours, and habits are absolutely stereotyped,\nand there is no doubt that some persons are so made as to find in this\nstability an incomparable kind of mental rest.\nWe have no time to multiply examples, so I will let the case of Saint\nLouis of Gonzaga serve as a type of excess in purification. I think you\nwill agree that this youth carried the elimination of the external and\ndiscordant to a point which we cannot unreservedly admire. At the age of\nten, his biographer says:\u2014\n\u201cThe inspiration came to him to consecrate to the Mother of God\nhis own virginity\u2014that being to her the most agreeable of possible\npresents. Without delay, then, and with all the fervor there was\nin him, joyous of heart, and burning with love, he made his vow of\nperpetual chastity. Mary accepted the offering of his innocent\nheart, and obtained for him from God, as a recompense, the\nextraordinary grace of never feeling during his entire life the\nslightest touch of temptation against the virtue of purity. This\nwas an altogether exceptional favor, rarely accorded even to\nSaints themselves, and all the more marvelous in that Louis dwelt\nalways in courts and among great folks, where danger and\nopportunity are so unusually frequent. It is true that Louis from\nhis earliest childhood had shown a natural repugnance for whatever\nmight be impure or unvirginal, and even for relations of any sort\nwhatever between persons of opposite sex. But this made it all the\nmore surprising that he should, especially since this vow, feel it\nnecessary to have recourse to such a number of expedients for\nprotecting against even the shadow of danger the virginity which\nhe had thus consecrated. One might suppose that if any one could\nhave contented himself with the ordinary precautions, prescribed\nfor all Christians, it would assuredly have been he. But no! In\nthe use of preservatives and means of defense, in flight from the\nmost insignificant occasions, from every possibility of peril,\njust as in the mortification of his flesh, he went farther than\nthe majority of saints. He, who by an extraordinary protection of\nGod\u2019s grace was never tempted, measured all his steps as if he\nwere threatened on every side by particular dangers. Thenceforward\nhe never raised his eyes, either when walking in the streets, or\nwhen in society. Not only did he avoid all business with females\neven more scrupulously than before, but he renounced all\nconversation and every kind of social recreation with them,\nalthough his father tried to make him take part; and he commenced\nonly too early to deliver his innocent body to austerities of\nevery kind.\u201d(210)\nAt the age of twelve, we read of this young man that \u201cif by chance his\nmother sent one of her maids of honor to him with a message, he never\nallowed her to come in, but listened to her through the barely opened\ndoor, and dismissed her immediately. He did not like to be alone with his\nown mother, whether at table or in conversation; and when the rest of the\ncompany withdrew, he sought also a pretext for retiring.... Several great\nladies, relatives of his, he avoided learning to know even by sight; and\nhe made a sort of treaty with his father, engaging promptly and readily to\naccede to all his wishes, if he might only be excused from all visits to\nladies.\u201d (Ibid., p. 71.)\nWhen he was seventeen years old Louis joined the Jesuit order(211) against\nhis father\u2019s passionate entreaties, for he was heir of a princely house;\nand when a year later the father died, he took the loss as a \u201cparticular\nattention\u201d to himself on God\u2019s part, and wrote letters of stilted good\nadvice, as from a spiritual superior, to his grieving mother. He soon\nbecame so good a monk that if any one asked him the number of his brothers\nand sisters, he had to reflect and count them over before replying. A\nFather asked him one day if he were never troubled by the thought of his\nfamily, to which, \u201cI never think of them except when praying for them,\u201d\nwas his only answer. Never was he seen to hold in his hand a flower or\nanything perfumed, that he might take pleasure in it. On the contrary, in\nthe hospital, he used to seek for whatever was most disgusting, and\neagerly snatch the bandages of ulcers, etc., from the hands of his\ncompanions. He avoided worldly talk, and immediately tried to turn every\nconversation on to pious subjects, or else he remained silent. He\nsystematically refused to notice his surroundings. Being ordered one day\nto bring a book from the rector\u2019s seat in the refectory, he had to ask\nwhere the rector sat, for in the three months he had eaten bread there, so\ncarefully did he guard his eyes that he had not noticed the place. One\nday, during recess, having looked by chance on one of his companions, he\nreproached himself as for a grave sin against modesty. He cultivated\nsilence, as preserving from sins of the tongue; and his greatest penance\nwas the limit which his superiors set to his bodily penances. He sought\nafter false accusations and unjust reprimands as opportunities of\nhumility; and such was his obedience that, when a room\u2010mate, having no\nmore paper, asked him for a sheet, he did not feel free to give it to him\nwithout first obtaining the permission of the superior, who, as such,\nstood in the place of God, and transmitted his orders.\nI can find no other sorts of fruit than these of Louis\u2019s saintship. He\ndied in 1591, in his twenty\u2010ninth year, and is known in the Church as the\npatron of all young people. On his festival, the altar in the chapel\ndevoted to him in a certain church in Rome \u201cis embosomed in flowers,\narranged with exquisite taste; and a pile of letters may be seen at its\nfoot, written to the Saint by young men and women, and directed to\n\u2018Paradiso.\u2019 They are supposed to be burnt unread except by San Luigi, who\nmust find singular petitions in these pretty little missives, tied up now\nwith a green ribbon, expressive of hope, now with a red one, emblematic of\nlove,\u201d etc.(212)\nOur final judgment of the worth of such a life as this will depend largely\non our conception of God, and of the sort of conduct he is best pleased\nwith in his creatures. The Catholicism of the sixteenth century paid\nlittle heed to social righteousness; and to leave the world to the devil\nwhilst saving one\u2019s own soul was then accounted no discreditable scheme.\nTo\u2010day, rightly or wrongly, helpfulness in general human affairs is, in\nconsequence of one of those secular mutations in moral sentiment of which\nI spoke, deemed an essential element of worth in character; and to be of\nsome public or private use is also reckoned as a species of divine\nservice. Other early Jesuits, especially the missionaries among them, the\nXaviers, Br\u00e9beufs, Jogues, were objective minds, and fought in their way\nfor the world\u2019s welfare; so their lives to\u2010day inspire us. But when the\nintellect, as in this Louis, is originally no larger than a pin\u2019s head,\nand cherishes ideas of God of corresponding smallness, the result,\nnotwithstanding the heroism put forth, is on the whole repulsive. Purity,\nwe see in the object\u2010lesson, is _not_ the one thing needful; and it is\nbetter that a life should contract many a dirt\u2010mark, than forfeit\nusefulness in its efforts to remain unspotted.\nProceeding onwards in our search of religious extravagance, we next come\nupon excesses of Tenderness and Charity. Here saintliness has to face the\ncharge of preserving the unfit, and breeding parasites and beggars.\n\u201cResist not evil,\u201d \u201cLove your enemies,\u201d these are saintly maxims of which\nmen of this world find it hard to speak without impatience. Are the men of\nthis world right, or are the saints in possession of the deeper range of\ntruth?\nNo simple answer is possible. Here, if anywhere, one feels the complexity\nof the moral life, and the mysteriousness of the way in which facts and\nideals are interwoven.\nPerfect conduct is a relation between three terms: the actor, the objects\nfor which he acts, and the recipients of the action. In order that conduct\nshould be abstractly perfect, all three terms, intention, execution, and\nreception, should be suited to one another. The best intention will fail\nif it either work by false means or address itself to the wrong recipient.\nThus no critic or estimator of the value of conduct can confine himself to\nthe actor\u2019s animus alone, apart from the other elements of the\nperformance. As there is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood by those\nwho hear it, so reasonable arguments, challenges to magnanimity, and\nappeals to sympathy or justice, are folly when we are dealing with human\ncrocodiles and boa\u2010constrictors. The saint may simply give the universe\ninto the hands of the enemy by his trustfulness. He may by non\u2010resistance\ncut off his own survival.\nHerbert Spencer tells us that the perfect man\u2019s conduct will appear\nperfect only when the environment is perfect: to no inferior environment\nis it suitably adapted. We may paraphrase this by cordially admitting that\nsaintly conduct would be the most perfect conduct conceivable in an\nenvironment where all were saints already; but by adding that in an\nenvironment where few are saints, and many the exact reverse of saints, it\nmust be ill adapted. We must frankly confess, then, using our empirical\ncommon sense and ordinary practical prejudices, that in the world that\nactually is, the virtues of sympathy, charity, and non\u2010resistance may be,\nand often have been, manifested in excess. The powers of darkness have\nsystematically taken advantage of them. The whole modern scientific\norganization of charity is a consequence of the failure of simply giving\nalms. The whole history of constitutional government is a commentary on\nthe excellence of resisting evil, and when one cheek is smitten, of\nsmiting back and not turning the other cheek also.\nYou will agree to this in general, for in spite of the Gospel, in spite of\nQuakerism, in spite of Tolstoi, you believe in fighting fire with fire, in\nshooting down usurpers, locking up thieves, and freezing out vagabonds and\nswindlers.\nAnd yet you are sure, as I am sure, that were the world confined to these\nhard\u2010headed, hard\u2010hearted, and hard\u2010fisted methods exclusively, were there\nno one prompt to help a brother first, and find out afterwards whether he\nwere worthy; no one willing to drown his private wrongs in pity for the\nwronger\u2019s person; no one ready to be duped many a time rather than live\nalways on suspicion; no one glad to treat individuals passionately and\nimpulsively rather than by general rules of prudence; the world would be\nan infinitely worse place than it is now to live in. The tender grace, not\nof a day that is dead, but of a day yet to be born somehow, with the\ngolden rule grown natural, would be cut out from the perspective of our\nimaginations.\nThe saints, existing in this way, may, with their extravagances of human\ntenderness, be prophetic. Nay, innumerable times they have proved\nthemselves prophetic. Treating those whom they met, in spite of the past,\nin spite of all appearances, as worthy, they have stimulated them to _be_\nworthy, miraculously transformed them by their radiant example and by the\nchallenge of their expectation.\nFrom this point of view we may admit the human charity which we find in\nall saints, and the great excess of it which we find in some saints, to be\na genuinely creative social force, tending to make real a degree of virtue\nwhich it alone is ready to assume as possible. The saints are authors,\n_auctores_, increasers, of goodness. The potentialities of development in\nhuman souls are unfathomable. So many who seemed irretrievably hardened\nhave in point of fact been softened, converted, regenerated, in ways that\namazed the subjects even more than they surprised the spectators, that we\nnever can be sure in advance of any man that his salvation by the way of\nlove is hopeless. We have no right to speak of human crocodiles and boa\u2010\nconstrictors as of fixedly incurable beings. We know not the complexities\nof personality, the smouldering emotional fires, the other facets of the\ncharacter\u2010polyhedron, the resources of the subliminal region. St. Paul\nlong ago made our ancestors familiar with the idea that every soul is\nvirtually sacred. Since Christ died for us all without exception, St. Paul\nsaid, we must despair of no one. This belief in the essential sacredness\nof every one expresses itself to\u2010day in all sorts of humane customs and\nreformatory institutions, and in a growing aversion to the death penalty\nand to brutality in punishment. The saints, with their extravagance of\nhuman tenderness, are the great torch\u2010bearers of this belief, the tip of\nthe wedge, the clearers of the darkness. Like the single drops which\nsparkle in the sun as they are flung far ahead of the advancing edge of a\nwave\u2010crest or of a flood, they show the way and are forerunners. The world\nis not yet with them, so they often seem in the midst of the world\u2019s\naffairs to be preposterous. Yet they are impregnators of the world,\nvivifiers and animaters of potentialities of goodness which but for them\nwould lie forever dormant. It is not possible to be quite as mean as we\nnaturally are, when they have passed before us. One fire kindles another;\nand without that over\u2010trust in human worth which they show, the rest of us\nwould lie in spiritual stagnancy.\nMomentarily considered, then, the saint may waste his tenderness and be\nthe dupe and victim of his charitable fever, but the general function of\nhis charity in social evolution is vital and essential. If things are ever\nto move upward, some one must be ready to take the first step, and assume\nthe risk of it. No one who is not willing to try charity, to try non\u2010\nresistance as the saint is always willing, can tell whether these methods\nwill or will not succeed. When they do succeed, they are far more\npowerfully successful than force or worldly prudence. Force destroys\nenemies; and the best that can be said of prudence is that it keeps what\nwe already have in safety. But non\u2010resistance, when successful, turns\nenemies into friends; and charity regenerates its objects. These saintly\nmethods are, as I said, creative energies; and genuine saints find in the\nelevated excitement with which their faith endows them an authority and\nimpressiveness which makes them irresistible in situations where men of\nshallower nature cannot get on at all without the use of worldly prudence.\nThis practical proof that worldly wisdom may be safely transcended is the\nsaint\u2019s magic gift to mankind.(213) Not only does his vision of a better\nworld console us for the generally prevailing prose and barrenness; but\neven when on the whole we have to confess him ill adapted, he makes some\nconverts, and the environment gets better for his ministry. He is an\neffective ferment of goodness, a slow transmuter of the earthly into a\nmore heavenly order.\nIn this respect the Utopian dreams of social justice in which many\ncontemporary socialists and anarchists indulge are, in spite of their\nimpracticability and non\u2010adaptation to present environmental conditions,\nanalogous to the saint\u2019s belief in an existent kingdom of heaven. They\nhelp to break the edge of the general reign of hardness, and are slow\nleavens of a better order.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next topic in order is Asceticism, which I fancy you are all ready to\nconsider without argument a virtue liable to extravagance and excess. The\noptimism and refinement of the modern imagination has, as I have already\nsaid elsewhere, changed the attitude of the church towards corporeal\nmortification, and a Suso or a Saint Peter of Alcantara(214) appear to us\nto\u2010day rather in the light of tragic mountebanks than of sane men\ninspiring us with respect. If the inner dispositions are right, we ask,\nwhat need of all this torment, this violation of the outer nature? It\nkeeps the outer nature too important. Any one who is genuinely emancipated\nfrom the flesh will look on pleasures and pains, abundance and privation,\nas alike irrelevant and indifferent. He can engage in actions and\nexperience enjoyments without fear of corruption or enslavement. As the\nBhagavad\u2010Gita says, only those need renounce worldly actions who are still\ninwardly attached thereto. If one be really unattached to the fruits of\naction, one may mix in the world with equanimity. I quoted in a former\nlecture Saint Augustine\u2019s antinomian saying: If you only love God enough,\nyou may safely follow all your inclinations. \u201cHe needs no devotional\npractices,\u201d is one of Ramakrishna\u2019s maxims, \u201cwhose heart is moved to tears\nat the mere mention of the name of Hari.\u201d(215) And the Buddha, in pointing\nout what he called \u201cthe middle way\u201d to his disciples, told them to abstain\nfrom both extremes, excessive mortification being as unreal and unworthy\nas mere desire and pleasure. The only perfect life, he said, is that of\ninner wisdom, which makes one thing as indifferent to us as another, and\nthus leads to rest, to peace, and to Nirv\u00e2na.(216)\nWe find accordingly that as ascetic saints have grown older, and directors\nof conscience more experienced, they usually have shown a tendency to lay\nless stress on special bodily mortifications. Catholic teachers have\nalways professed the rule that, since health is needed for efficiency in\nGod\u2019s service, health must not be sacrificed to mortification. The general\noptimism and healthy\u2010mindedness of liberal Protestant circles to\u2010day makes\nmortification for mortification\u2019s sake repugnant to us. We can no longer\nsympathize with cruel deities, and the notion that God can take delight in\nthe spectacle of sufferings self\u2010inflicted in his honor is abhorrent. In\nconsequence of all these motives you probably are disposed, unless some\nspecial utility can be shown in some individual\u2019s discipline, to treat the\ngeneral tendency to asceticism as pathological.\nYet I believe that a more careful consideration of the whole matter,\ndistinguishing between the general good intention of asceticism and the\nuselessness of some of the particular acts of which it may be guilty,\nought to rehabilitate it in our esteem. For in its spiritual meaning\nasceticism stands for nothing less than for the essence of the twice\u2010born\nphilosophy. It symbolizes, lamely enough no doubt, but sincerely, the\nbelief that there is an element of real wrongness in this world, which is\nneither to be ignored nor evaded, but which must be squarely met and\novercome by an appeal to the soul\u2019s heroic resources, and neutralized and\ncleansed away by suffering. As against this view, the ultra\u2010optimistic\nform of the once\u2010born philosophy thinks we may treat evil by the method of\nignoring. Let a man who, by fortunate health and circumstances, escapes\nthe suffering of any great amount of evil in his own person, also close\nhis eyes to it as it exists in the wider universe outside his private\nexperience, and he will be quit of it altogether, and can sail through\nlife happily on a healthy\u2010minded basis. But we saw in our lectures on\nmelancholy how precarious this attempt necessarily is. Moreover it is but\nfor the individual; and leaves the evil outside of him, unredeemed and\nunprovided for in his philosophy.\nNo such attempt can be a _general_ solution of the problem; and to minds\nof sombre tinge, who naturally feel life as a tragic mystery, such\noptimism is a shallow dodge or mean evasion. It accepts, in lieu of a real\ndeliverance, what is a lucky personal accident merely, a cranny to escape\nby. It leaves the general world unhelped and still in the clutch of Satan.\nThe real deliverance, the twice\u2010born folk insist, must be of universal\napplication. Pain and wrong and death must be fairly met and overcome in\nhigher excitement, or else their sting remains essentially unbroken. If\none has ever taken the fact of the prevalence of tragic death in this\nworld\u2019s history fairly into his mind,\u2014freezing, drowning, entombment\nalive, wild beasts, worse men, and hideous diseases,\u2014he can with\ndifficulty, it seems to me, continue his own career of worldly prosperity\nwithout suspecting that he may all the while not be really inside the\ngame, that he may lack the great initiation.\nWell, this is exactly what asceticism thinks; and it voluntarily takes the\ninitiation. Life is neither farce nor genteel comedy, it says, but\nsomething we must sit at in mourning garments, hoping its bitter taste\nwill purge us of our folly. The wild and the heroic are indeed such rooted\nparts of it that healthy\u2010mindedness pure and simple, with its sentimental\noptimism, can hardly be regarded by any thinking man as a serious\nsolution. Phrases of neatness, cosiness, and comfort can never be an\nanswer to the sphinx\u2019s riddle.\nIn these remarks I am leaning only upon mankind\u2019s common instinct for\nreality, which in point of fact has always held the world to be\nessentially a theatre for heroism. In heroism, we feel, life\u2019s supreme\nmystery is hidden. We tolerate no one who has no capacity whatever for it\nin any direction. On the other hand, no matter what a man\u2019s frailties\notherwise may be, if he be willing to risk death, and still more if he\nsuffer it heroically, in the service he has chosen, the fact consecrates\nhim forever. Inferior to ourselves in this or that way, if yet we cling to\nlife, and he is able \u201cto fling it away like a flower\u201d as caring nothing\nfor it, we account him in the deepest way our born superior. Each of us in\nhis own person feels that a high\u2010hearted indifference to life would\nexpiate all his shortcomings.\nThe metaphysical mystery, thus recognized by common sense, that he who\nfeeds on death that feeds on men possesses life supereminently and\nexcellently, and meets best the secret demands of the universe, is the\ntruth of which asceticism has been the faithful champion. The folly of the\ncross, so inexplicable by the intellect, has yet its indestructible vital\nmeaning.\nRepresentatively, then, and symbolically, and apart from the vagaries into\nwhich the unenlightened intellect of former times may have let it wander,\nasceticism must, I believe, be acknowledged to go with the profounder way\nof handling the gift of existence. Naturalistic optimism is mere syllabub\nand flattery and sponge\u2010cake in comparison. The practical course of action\nfor us, as religious men, would therefore, it seems to me, not be simply\nto turn our backs upon the ascetic impulse, as most of us to\u2010day turn\nthem, but rather to discover some outlet for it of which the fruits in the\nway of privation and hardship might be objectively useful. The older\nmonastic asceticism occupied itself with pathetic futilities, or\nterminated in the mere egotism of the individual, increasing his own\nperfection.(217) But is it not possible for us to discard most of these\nolder forms of mortification, and yet find saner channels for the heroism\nwhich inspired them?\nDoes not, for example, the worship of material luxury and wealth, which\nconstitutes so large a portion of the \u201cspirit\u201d of our age, make somewhat\nfor effeminacy and unmanliness? Is not the exclusively sympathetic and\nfacetious way in which most children are brought up to\u2010day\u2014so different\nfrom the education of a hundred years ago, especially in evangelical\ncircles\u2014in danger, in spite of its many advantages, of developing a\ncertain trashiness of fibre? Are there not hereabouts some points of\napplication for a renovated and revised ascetic discipline?\nMany of you would recognize such dangers, but would point to athletics,\nmilitarism, and individual and national enterprise and adventure as the\nremedies. These contemporary ideals are quite as remarkable for the energy\nwith which they make for heroic standards of life, as contemporary\nreligion is remarkable for the way in which it neglects them.(218) War and\nadventure assuredly keep all who engage in them from treating themselves\ntoo tenderly. They demand such incredible efforts, depth beyond depth of\nexertion, both in degree and in duration, that the whole scale of\nmotivation alters. Discomfort and annoyance, hunger and wet, pain and\ncold, squalor and filth, cease to have any deterrent operation whatever.\nDeath turns into a commonplace matter, and its usual power to check our\naction vanishes. With the annulling of these customary inhibitions, ranges\nof new energy are set free, and life seems cast upon a higher plane of\npower.\nThe beauty of war in this respect is that it is so congruous with ordinary\nhuman nature. Ancestral evolution has made us all potential warriors; so\nthe most insignificant individual, when thrown into an army in the field,\nis weaned from whatever excess of tenderness towards his precious person\nhe may bring with him, and may easily develop into a monster of\ninsensibility.\nBut when we compare the military type of self\u2010severity with that of the\nascetic saint, we find a world\u2010wide difference in all their spiritual\nconcomitants.\n\u201c \u2018Live and let live,\u2019 \u201d writes a clear\u2010headed Austrian officer, \u201cis no\ndevice for an army. Contempt for one\u2019s own comrades, for the troops of the\nenemy, and, above all, fierce contempt for one\u2019s own person, are what war\ndemands of every one. Far better is it for an army to be too savage, too\ncruel, too barbarous, than to possess too much sentimentality and human\nreasonableness. If the soldier is to be good for anything as a soldier, he\nmust be exactly the opposite of a reasoning and thinking man. The measure\nof goodness in him is his possible use in war. War, and even peace,\nrequire of the soldier absolutely peculiar standards of morality. The\nrecruit brings with him common moral notions, of which he must seek\nimmediately to get rid. For him victory, success, must be _everything_.\nThe most barbaric tendencies in men come to life again in war, and for\nwar\u2019s uses they are incommensurably good.\u201d(219)\nThese words are of course literally true. The immediate aim of the\nsoldier\u2019s life is, as Moltke said, destruction, and nothing but\ndestruction; and whatever constructions wars result in are remote and non\u2010\nmilitary. Consequently the soldier cannot train himself to be too\nfeelingless to all those usual sympathies and respects, whether for\npersons or for things, that make for conservation. Yet the fact remains\nthat war is a school of strenuous life and heroism; and, being in the line\nof aboriginal instinct, is the only school that as yet is universally\navailable. But when we gravely ask ourselves whether this wholesale\norganization of irrationality and crime be our only bulwark against\neffeminacy, we stand aghast at the thought, and think more kindly of\nascetic religion. One hears of the mechanical equivalent of heat. What we\nnow need to discover in the social realm is the moral equivalent of war:\nsomething heroic that will speak to men as universally as war does, and\nyet will be as compatible with their spiritual selves as war has proved\nitself to be incompatible. I have often thought that in the old monkish\npoverty\u2010worship, in spite of the pedantry which infested it, there might\nbe something like that moral equivalent of war which we are seeking. May\nnot voluntarily accepted poverty be \u201cthe strenuous life,\u201d without the need\nof crushing weaker peoples?\nPoverty indeed _is_ the strenuous life,\u2014without brass bands or uniforms or\nhysteric popular applause or lies or circumlocutions; and when one sees\nthe way in which wealth\u2010getting enters as an ideal into the very bone and\nmarrow of our generation, one wonders whether a revival of the belief that\npoverty is a worthy religious vocation may not be \u201cthe transformation of\nmilitary courage,\u201d and the spiritual reform which our time stands most in\nneed of.\nAmong us English\u2010speaking peoples especially do the praises of poverty\nneed once more to be boldly sung. We have grown literally afraid to be\npoor. We despise any one who elects to be poor in order to simplify and\nsave his inner life. If he does not join the general scramble and pant\nwith the money\u2010making street, we deem him spiritless and lacking in\nambition. We have lost the power even of imagining what the ancient\nidealization of poverty could have meant: the liberation from material\nattachments, the unbribed soul, the manlier indifference, the paying our\nway by what we are or do and not by what we have, the right to fling away\nour life at any moment irresponsibly,\u2014the more athletic trim, in short,\nthe moral fighting shape. When we of the so\u2010called better classes are\nscared as men were never scared in history at material ugliness and\nhardship; when we put off marriage until our house can be artistic, and\nquake at the thought of having a child without a bank\u2010account and doomed\nto manual labor, it is time for thinking men to protest against so unmanly\nand irreligious a state of opinion.\nIt is true that so far as wealth gives time for ideal ends and exercise to\nideal energies, wealth is better than poverty and ought to be chosen. But\nwealth does this in only a portion of the actual cases. Elsewhere the\ndesire to gain wealth and the fear to lose it are our chief breeders of\ncowardice and propagators of corruption. There are thousands of\nconjunctures in which a wealth\u2010bound man must be a slave, whilst a man for\nwhom poverty has no terrors becomes a freeman. Think of the strength which\npersonal indifference to poverty would give us if we were devoted to\nunpopular causes. We need no longer hold our tongues or fear to vote the\nrevolutionary or reformatory ticket. Our stocks might fall, our hopes of\npromotion vanish, our salaries stop, our club doors close in our faces;\nyet, while we lived, we would imperturbably bear witness to the spirit,\nand our example would help to set free our generation. The cause would\nneed its funds, but we its servants would be potent in proportion as we\npersonally were contented with our poverty.\nI recommend this matter to your serious pondering, for it is certain that\nthe prevalent fear of poverty among the educated classes is the worst\nmoral disease from which our civilization suffers.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nI have now said all that I can usefully say about the several fruits of\nreligion as they are manifested in saintly lives, so I will make a brief\nreview and pass to my more general conclusions.\nOur question, you will remember, is as to whether religion stands approved\nby its fruits, as these are exhibited in the saintly type of character.\nSingle attributes of saintliness may, it is true, be temperamental\nendowments, found in non\u2010religious individuals. But the whole group of\nthem forms a combination which, as such, is religious, for it seems to\nflow from the sense of the divine as from its psychological centre.\nWhoever possesses strongly this sense comes naturally to think that the\nsmallest details of this world derive infinite significance from their\nrelation to an unseen divine order. The thought of this order yields him a\nsuperior denomination of happiness, and a steadfastness of soul with which\nno other can compare. In social relations his serviceability is exemplary;\nhe abounds in impulses to help. His help is inward as well as outward, for\nhis sympathy reaches souls as well as bodies, and kindles unsuspected\nfaculties therein. Instead of placing happiness where common men place it,\nin comfort, he places it in a higher kind of inner excitement, which\nconverts discomforts into sources of cheer and annuls unhappiness. So he\nturns his back upon no duty, however thankless; and when we are in need of\nassistance, we can count upon the saint lending his hand with more\ncertainty than we can count upon any other person. Finally, his humble\u2010\nmindedness and his ascetic tendencies save him from the petty personal\npretensions which so obstruct our ordinary social intercourse, and his\npurity gives us in him a clean man for a companion. Felicity, purity,\ncharity, patience, self\u2010severity,\u2014these are splendid excellencies, and the\nsaint of all men shows them in the completest possible measure.\nBut, as we saw, all these things together do not make saints infallible.\nWhen their intellectual outlook is narrow, they fall into all sorts of\nholy excesses, fanaticism or theopathic absorption, self\u2010torment, prudery,\nscrupulosity, gullibility, and morbid inability to meet the world. By the\nvery intensity of his fidelity to the paltry ideals with which an inferior\nintellect may inspire him, a saint can be even more objectionable and\ndamnable than a superficial carnal man would be in the same situation. We\nmust judge him not sentimentally only, and not in isolation, but using our\nown intellectual standards, placing him in his environment, and estimating\nhis total function.\nNow in the matter of intellectual standards, we must bear in mind that it\nis unfair, where we find narrowness of mind, always to impute it as a vice\nto the individual, for in religious and theological matters he probably\nabsorbs his narrowness from his generation. Moreover, we must not confound\nthe essentials of saintliness, which are those general passions of which I\nhave spoken, with its accidents, which are the special determinations of\nthese passions at any historical moment. In these determinations the\nsaints will usually be loyal to the temporary idols of their tribe. Taking\nrefuge in monasteries was as much an idol of the tribe in the middle ages,\nas bearing a hand in the world\u2019s work is to\u2010day. Saint Francis or Saint\nBernard, were they living to\u2010day, would undoubtedly be leading consecrated\nlives of some sort, but quite as undoubtedly they would not lead them in\nretirement. Our animosity to special historic manifestations must not lead\nus to give away the saintly impulses in their essential nature to the\ntender mercies of inimical critics.\nThe most inimical critic of the saintly impulses whom I know is Nietzsche.\nHe contrasts them with the worldly passions as we find these embodied in\nthe predaceous military character, altogether to the advantage of the\nlatter. Your born saint, it must be confessed, has something about him\nwhich often makes the gorge of a carnal man rise, so it will be worth\nwhile to consider the contrast in question more fully.\nDislike of the saintly nature seems to be a negative result of the\nbiologically useful instinct of welcoming leadership, and glorifying the\nchief of the tribe. The chief is the potential, if not the actual tyrant,\nthe masterful, overpowering man of prey. We confess our inferiority and\ngrovel before him. We quail under his glance, and are at the same time\nproud of owning so dangerous a lord. Such instinctive and submissive hero\u2010\nworship must have been indispensable in primeval tribal life. In the\nendless wars of those times, leaders were absolutely needed for the\ntribe\u2019s survival. If there were any tribes who owned no leaders, they can\nhave left no issue to narrate their doom. The leaders always had good\nconsciences, for conscience in them coalesced with will, and those who\nlooked on their face were as much smitten with wonder at their freedom\nfrom inner restraint as with awe at the energy of their outward\nperformances.\nCompared with these beaked and taloned graspers of the world, saints are\nherbivorous animals, tame and harmless barn\u2010yard poultry. There are saints\nwhose beard you may, if you ever care to, pull with impunity. Such a man\nexcites no thrills of wonder veiled in terror; his conscience is full of\nscruples and returns; he stuns us neither by his inward freedom nor his\noutward power; and unless he found within us an altogether different\nfaculty of admiration to appeal to, we should pass him by with contempt.\nIn point of fact, he does appeal to a different faculty. Re\u00ebnacted in\nhuman nature is the fable of the wind, the sun, and the traveler. The\nsexes embody the discrepancy. The woman loves the man the more admiringly\nthe stormier he shows himself, and the world deifies its rulers the more\nfor being willful and unaccountable. But the woman in turn subjugates the\nman by the mystery of gentleness in beauty, and the saint has always\ncharmed the world by something similar. Mankind is susceptible and\nsuggestible in opposite directions, and the rivalry of influences is\nunsleeping. The saintly and the worldly ideal pursue their feud in\nliterature as much as in real life.\nFor Nietzsche the saint represents little but sneakingness and\nslavishness. He is the sophisticated invalid, the degenerate _par\nexcellence_, the man of insufficient vitality. His prevalence would put\nthe human type in danger.\n\u201cThe sick are the greatest danger for the well. The weaker, not\nthe stronger, are the strong\u2019s undoing. It is not _fear_ of our\nfellow\u2010man, which we should wish to see diminished; for fear\nrouses those who are strong to become terrible in turn themselves,\nand preserves the hard\u2010earned and successful type of humanity.\nWhat is to be dreaded by us more than any other doom is not fear,\nbut rather the great disgust, not fear, but rather the great\npity\u2014disgust and pity for our human fellows.... The _morbid_ are\nour greatest peril\u2014not the \u2018bad\u2019 men, not the predatory beings.\nThose born wrong, the miscarried, the broken\u2014they it is, the\n_weakest_, who are undermining the vitality of the race, poisoning\nour trust in life, and putting humanity in question. Every look of\nthem is a sigh,\u2014\u2018Would I were something other! I am sick and tired\nof what I am.\u2019 In this swamp\u2010soil of self\u2010contempt, every\npoisonous weed flourishes, and all so small, so secret, so\ndishonest, and so sweetly rotten. Here swarm the worms of\nsensitiveness and resentment; here the air smells odious with\nsecrecy, with what is not to be acknowledged; here is woven\nendlessly the net of the meanest of conspiracies, the conspiracy\nof those who suffer against those who succeed and are victorious;\nhere the very aspect of the victorious is hated\u2014as if health,\nsuccess, strength, pride, and the sense of power were in\nthemselves things vicious, for which one ought eventually to make\nbitter expiation. Oh, how these people would themselves like to\ninflict the expiation, how they thirst to be the hangmen! And all\nthe while their duplicity never confesses their hatred to be\nhatred.\u201d(220)\nPoor Nietzsche\u2019s antipathy is itself sickly enough, but we all know what\nhe means, and he expresses well the clash between the two ideals. The\ncarnivorous\u2010minded \u201cstrong man,\u201d the adult male and cannibal, can see\nnothing but mouldiness and morbidness in the saint\u2019s gentleness and self\u2010\nseverity, and regards him with pure loathing. The whole feud revolves\nessentially upon two pivots: Shall the seen world or the unseen world be\nour chief sphere of adaptation? and must our means of adaptation in this\nseen world be aggressiveness or non\u2010resistance?\nThe debate is serious. In some sense and to some degree both worlds must\nbe acknowledged and taken account of; and in the seen world both\naggressiveness and non\u2010resistance are needful. It is a question of\nemphasis, of more or less. Is the saint\u2019s type or the strong\u2010man\u2019s type\nthe more ideal?\nIt has often been supposed, and even now, I think, it is supposed by most\npersons, that there can be one intrinsically ideal type of human\ncharacter. A certain kind of man, it is imagined, must be the best man\nabsolutely and apart from the utility of his function, apart from\neconomical considerations. The saint\u2019s type, and the knight\u2019s or\ngentleman\u2019s type, have always been rival claimants of this absolute\nideality; and in the ideal of military religious orders both types were in\na manner blended. According to the empirical philosophy, however, all\nideals are matters of relation. It would be absurd, for example, to ask\nfor a definition of \u201cthe ideal horse,\u201d so long as dragging drays and\nrunning races, bearing children, and jogging about with tradesmen\u2019s\npackages all remain as indispensable differentiations of equine function.\nYou may take what you call a general all\u2010round animal as a compromise, but\nhe will be inferior to any horse of a more specialized type, in some one\nparticular direction. We must not forget this now when, in discussing\nsaintliness, we ask if it be an ideal type of manhood. We must test it by\nits economical relations.\nI think that the method which Mr. Spencer uses in his Data of Ethics will\nhelp to fix our opinion. Ideality in conduct is altogether a matter of\nadaptation. A society where all were invariably aggressive would destroy\nitself by inner friction, and in a society where some are aggressive,\nothers must be non\u2010resistant, if there is to be any kind of order. This is\nthe present constitution of society, and to the mixture we owe many of our\nblessings. But the aggressive members of society are always tending to\nbecome bullies, robbers, and swindlers; and no one believes that such a\nstate of things as we now live in is the millennium. It is meanwhile quite\npossible to conceive an imaginary society in which there should be no\naggressiveness, but only sympathy and fairness,\u2014any small community of\ntrue friends now realizes such a society. Abstractly considered, such a\nsociety on a large scale would be the millennium, for every good thing\nmight be realized there with no expense of friction. To such a millennial\nsociety the saint would be entirely adapted. His peaceful modes of appeal\nwould be efficacious over his companions, and there would be no one extant\nto take advantage of his non\u2010resistance. The saint is therefore abstractly\na higher type of man than the \u201cstrong man,\u201d because he is adapted to the\nhighest society conceivable, whether that society ever be concretely\npossible or not. The strong man would immediately tend by his presence to\nmake that society deteriorate. It would become inferior in everything save\nin a certain kind of bellicose excitement, dear to men as they now are.\nBut if we turn from the abstract question to the actual situation, we find\nthat the individual saint may be well or ill adapted, according to\nparticular circumstances. There is, in short, no absoluteness in the\nexcellence of sainthood. It must be confessed that as far as this world\ngoes, any one who makes an out\u2010and\u2010out saint of himself does so at his\nperil. If he is not a large enough man, he may appear more insignificant\nand contemptible, for all his saintship, than if he had remained a\nworldling.(221) Accordingly religion has seldom been so radically taken in\nour Western world that the devotee could not mix it with some worldly\ntemper. It has always found good men who could follow most of its\nimpulses, but who stopped short when it came to non\u2010resistance. Christ\nhimself was fierce upon occasion. Cromwells, Stonewall Jacksons, Gordons,\nshow that Christians can be strong men also.\nHow is success to be absolutely measured when there are so many\nenvironments and so many ways of looking at the adaptation? It cannot be\nmeasured absolutely; the verdict will vary according to the point of view\nadopted. From the biological point of view Saint Paul was a failure,\nbecause he was beheaded. Yet he was magnificently adapted to the larger\nenvironment of history; and so far as any saint\u2019s example is a leaven of\nrighteousness in the world, and draws it in the direction of more\nprevalent habits of saintliness, he is a success, no matter what his\nimmediate bad fortune may be. The greatest saints, the spiritual heroes\nwhom every one acknowledges, the Francises, Bernards, Luthers, Loyolas,\nWesleys, Channings, Moodys, Gratrys, the Phillips Brookses, the Agnes\nJoneses, Margaret Hallahans, and Dora Pattisons, are successes from the\noutset. They show themselves, and there is no question; every one\nperceives their strength and stature. Their sense of mystery in things,\ntheir passion, their goodness, irradiate about them and enlarge their\noutlines while they soften them. They are like pictures with an atmosphere\nand background; and, placed alongside of them, the strong men of this\nworld and no other seem as dry as sticks, as hard and crude as blocks of\nstone or brickbats.\nIn a general way, then, and \u201con the whole,\u201d(222) our abandonment of\ntheological criteria, and our testing of religion by practical common\nsense and the empirical method, leave it in possession of its towering\nplace in history. Economically, the saintly group of qualities is\nindispensable to the world\u2019s welfare. The great saints are immediate\nsuccesses; the smaller ones are at least heralds and harbingers, and they\nmay be leavens also, of a better mundane order. Let us be saints, then, if\nwe can, whether or not we succeed visibly and temporally. But in our\nFather\u2019s house are many mansions, and each of us must discover for himself\nthe kind of religion and the amount of saintship which best comports with\nwhat he believes to be his powers and feels to be his truest mission and\nvocation. There are no successes to be guaranteed and no set orders to be\ngiven to individuals, so long as we follow the methods of empirical\nphilosophy.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThis is my conclusion so far. I know that on some of your minds it leaves\na feeling of wonder that such a method should have been applied to such a\nsubject, and this in spite of all those remarks about empiricism which I\nmade at the beginning of Lecture XIII.(223) How, you say, can religion,\nwhich believes in two worlds and an invisible order, be estimated by the\nadaptation of its fruits to this world\u2019s order alone? It is its _truth_,\nnot its utility, you insist, upon which our verdict ought to depend. If\nreligion is true, its fruits are good fruits, even though in this world\nthey should prove uniformly ill adapted and full of naught but pathos. It\ngoes back, then, after all, to the question of the truth of theology. The\nplot inevitably thickens upon us; we cannot escape theoretical\nconsiderations. I propose, then, that to some degree we face the\nresponsibility. Religious persons have often, though not uniformly,\nprofessed to see truth in a special manner. That manner is known as\nmysticism. I will consequently now proceed to treat at some length of\nmystical phenomena, and after that, though more briefly, I will consider\nreligious philosophy.\nLECTURES XVI AND XVII. MYSTICISM.\nOver and over again in these lectures I have raised points and left them\nopen and unfinished until we should have come to the subject of Mysticism.\nSome of you, I fear, may have smiled as you noted my reiterated\npostponements. But now the hour has come when mysticism must be faced in\ngood earnest, and those broken threads wound up together. One may say\ntruly, I think, that personal religious experience has its root and centre\nin mystical states of consciousness; so for us, who in these lectures are\ntreating personal experience as the exclusive subject of our study, such\nstates of consciousness ought to form the vital chapter from which the\nother chapters get their light. Whether my treatment of mystical states\nwill shed more light or darkness, I do not know, for my own constitution\nshuts me out from their enjoyment almost entirely, and I can speak of them\nonly at second hand. But though forced to look upon the subject so\nexternally, I will be as objective and receptive as I can; and I think I\nshall at least succeed in convincing you of the reality of the states in\nquestion, and of the paramount importance of their function.\nFirst of all, then, I ask, What does the expression \u201cmystical states of\nconsciousness\u201d mean? How do we part off mystical states from other states?\nThe words \u201cmysticism\u201d and \u201cmystical\u201d are often used as terms of mere\nreproach, to throw at any opinion which we regard as vague and vast and\nsentimental, and without a base in either facts or logic. For some writers\na \u201cmystic\u201d is any person who believes in thought\u2010transference, or spirit\u2010\nreturn. Employed in this way the word has little value: there are too many\nless ambiguous synonyms. So, to keep it useful by restricting it, I will\ndo what I did in the case of the word \u201creligion,\u201d and simply propose to\nyou four marks which, when an experience has them, may justify us in\ncalling it mystical for the purpose of the present lectures. In this way\nwe shall save verbal disputation, and the recriminations that generally go\ntherewith.\n1. _Ineffability._\u2014The handiest of the marks by which I classify a state\nof mind as mystical is negative. The subject of it immediately says that\nit defies expression, that no adequate report of its contents can be given\nin words. It follows from this that its quality must be directly\nexperienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to others. In this\npeculiarity mystical states are more like states of feeling than like\nstates of intellect. No one can make clear to another who has never had a\ncertain feeling, in what the quality or worth of it consists. One must\nhave musical ears to know the value of a symphony; one must have been in\nlove one\u2019s self to understand a lover\u2019s state of mind. Lacking the heart\nor ear, we cannot interpret the musician or the lover justly, and are even\nlikely to consider him weak\u2010minded or absurd. The mystic finds that most\nof us accord to his experiences an equally incompetent treatment.\n2. _Noetic quality._\u2014Although so similar to states of feeling, mystical\nstates seem to those who experience them to be also states of knowledge.\nThey are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the\ndiscursive intellect. They are illuminations, revelations, full of\nsignificance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain; and as a\nrule they carry with them a curious sense of authority for after\u2010time.\nThese two characters will entitle any state to be called mystical, in the\nsense in which I use the word. Two other qualities are less sharply\nmarked, but are usually found. These are:\u2014\n3. _Transiency._\u2014Mystical states cannot be sustained for long. Except in\nrare instances, half an hour, or at most an hour or two, seems to be the\nlimit beyond which they fade into the light of common day. Often, when\nfaded, their quality can but imperfectly be reproduced in memory; but when\nthey recur it is recognized; and from one recurrence to another it is\nsusceptible of continuous development in what is felt as inner richness\nand importance.\n4. _Passivity._\u2014Although the oncoming of mystical states may be\nfacilitated by preliminary voluntary operations, as by fixing the\nattention, or going through certain bodily performances, or in other ways\nwhich manuals of mysticism prescribe; yet when the characteristic sort of\nconsciousness once has set in, the mystic feels as if his own will were in\nabeyance, and indeed sometimes as if he were grasped and held by a\nsuperior power. This latter peculiarity connects mystical states with\ncertain definite phenomena of secondary or alternative personality, such\nas prophetic speech, automatic writing, or the mediumistic trance. When\nthese latter conditions are well pronounced, however, there may be no\nrecollection whatever of the phenomenon, and it may have no significance\nfor the subject\u2019s usual inner life, to which, as it were, it makes a mere\ninterruption. Mystical states, strictly so called, are never merely\ninterruptive. Some memory of their content always remains, and a profound\nsense of their importance. They modify the inner life of the subject\nbetween the times of their recurrence. Sharp divisions in this region are,\nhowever, difficult to make, and we find all sorts of gradations and\nmixtures.\nThese four characteristics are sufficient to mark out a group of states of\nconsciousness peculiar enough to deserve a special name and to call for\ncareful study. Let it then be called the mystical group.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nOur next step should be to gain acquaintance with some typical examples.\nProfessional mystics at the height of their development have often\nelaborately organized experiences and a philosophy based thereupon. But\nyou remember what I said in my first lecture: phenomena are best\nunderstood when placed within their series, studied in their germ and in\ntheir over\u2010ripe decay, and compared with their exaggerated and degenerated\nkindred. The range of mystical experience is very wide, much too wide for\nus to cover in the time at our disposal. Yet the method of serial study is\nso essential for interpretation that if we really wish to reach\nconclusions we must use it. I will begin, therefore, with phenomena which\nclaim no special religious significance, and end with those of which the\nreligious pretensions are extreme.\nThe simplest rudiment of mystical experience would seem to be that\ndeepened sense of the significance of a maxim or formula which\noccasionally sweeps over one. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that said all my life,\u201d we\nexclaim, \u201cbut I never realized its full meaning until now.\u201d \u201cWhen a\nfellow\u2010monk,\u201d said Luther, \u201cone day repeated the words of the Creed: \u2018I\nbelieve in the forgiveness of sins,\u2019 I saw the Scripture in an entirely\nnew light; and straightway I felt as if I were born anew. It was as if I\nhad found the door of paradise thrown wide open.\u201d(224) This sense of\ndeeper significance is not confined to rational propositions. Single\nwords,(225) and conjunctions of words, effects of light on land and sea,\nodors and musical sounds, all bring it when the mind is tuned aright. Most\nof us can remember the strangely moving power of passages in certain poems\nread when we were young, irrational doorways as they were through which\nthe mystery of fact, the wildness and the pang of life, stole into our\nhearts and thrilled them. The words have now perhaps become mere polished\nsurfaces for us; but lyric poetry and music are alive and significant only\nin proportion as they fetch these vague vistas of a life continuous with\nour own, beckoning and inviting, yet ever eluding our pursuit. We are\nalive or dead to the eternal inner message of the arts according as we\nhave kept or lost this mystical susceptibility.\nA more pronounced step forward on the mystical ladder is found in an\nextremely frequent phenomenon, that sudden feeling, namely, which\nsometimes sweeps over us, of having \u201cbeen here before,\u201d as if at some\nindefinite past time, in just this place, with just these people, we were\nalready saying just these things. As Tennyson writes:\n\u201cMoreover, something is or seems,\nThat touches me with mystic gleams,\nLike glimpses of forgotten dreams\u2014\n\u201cOf something felt, like something here;\nOf something done, I know not where;\nSuch as no language may declare.\u201d(226)\nSir James Crichton\u2010Browne has given the technical name of \u201cdreamy states\u201d\nto these sudden invasions of vaguely reminiscent consciousness.(227) They\nbring a sense of mystery and of the metaphysical duality of things, and\nthe feeling of an enlargement of perception which seems imminent but which\nnever completes itself. In Dr. Crichton\u2010Browne\u2019s opinion they connect\nthemselves with the perplexed and scared disturbances of self\u2010\nconsciousness which occasionally precede epileptic attacks. I think that\nthis learned alienist takes a rather absurdly alarmist view of an\nintrinsically insignificant phenomenon. He follows it along the downward\nladder, to insanity; our path pursues the upward ladder chiefly. The\ndivergence shows how important it is to neglect no part of a phenomenon\u2019s\nconnections, for we make it appear admirable or dreadful according to the\ncontext by which we set it off.\nSomewhat deeper plunges into mystical consciousness are met with in yet\nother dreamy states. Such feelings as these which Charles Kingsley\ndescribes are surely far from being uncommon, especially in youth:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I walk the fields, I am oppressed now and then with an\ninnate feeling that everything I see has a meaning, if I could but\nunderstand it. And this feeling of being surrounded with truths\nwhich I cannot grasp amounts to indescribable awe sometimes....\nHave you not felt that your real soul was imperceptible to your\nmental vision, except in a few hallowed moments?\u201d(228)\nA much more extreme state of mystical consciousness is described by J. A.\nSymonds; and probably more persons than we suspect could give parallels to\nit from their own experience.\n\u201cSuddenly,\u201d writes Symonds, \u201cat church, or in company, or when I\nwas reading, and always, I think, when my muscles were at rest, I\nfelt the approach of the mood. Irresistibly it took possession of\nmy mind and will, lasted what seemed an eternity, and disappeared\nin a series of rapid sensations which resembled the awakening from\nan\u00e6sthetic influence. One reason why I disliked this kind of\ntrance was that I could not describe it to myself. I cannot even\nnow find words to render it intelligible. It consisted in a\ngradual but swiftly progressive obliteration of space, time,\nsensation, and the multitudinous factors of experience which seem\nto qualify what we are pleased to call our Self. In proportion as\nthese conditions of ordinary consciousness were subtracted, the\nsense of an underlying or essential consciousness acquired\nintensity. At last nothing remained but a pure, absolute, abstract\nSelf. The universe became without form and void of content. But\nSelf persisted, formidable in its vivid keenness, feeling the most\npoignant doubt about reality, ready, as it seemed, to find\nexistence break as breaks a bubble round about it. And what then?\nThe apprehension of a coming dissolution, the grim conviction that\nthis state was the last state of the conscious Self, the sense\nthat I had followed the last thread of being to the verge of the\nabyss, and had arrived at demonstration of eternal Maya or\nillusion, stirred or seemed to stir me up again. The return to\nordinary conditions of sentient existence began by my first\nrecovering the power of touch, and then by the gradual though\nrapid influx of familiar impressions and diurnal interests. At\nlast I felt myself once more a human being; and though the riddle\nof what is meant by life remained unsolved, I was thankful for\nthis return from the abyss\u2014this deliverance from so awful an\ninitiation into the mysteries of skepticism.\n\u201cThis trance recurred with diminishing frequency until I reached\nthe age of twenty\u2010eight. It served to impress upon my growing\nnature the phantasmal unreality of all the circumstances which\ncontribute to a merely phenomenal consciousness. Often have I\nasked myself with anguish, on waking from that formless state of\ndenuded, keenly sentient being, Which is the unreality?\u2014the trance\nof fiery, vacant, apprehensive, skeptical Self from which I issue,\nor these surrounding phenomena and habits which veil that inner\nSelf and build a self of flesh\u2010and\u2010blood conventionality? Again,\nare men the factors of some dream, the dream\u2010like unsubstantiality\nof which they comprehend at such eventful moments? What would\nhappen if the final stage of the trance were reached?\u201d(229)\nIn a recital like this there is certainly something suggestive of\npathology.(230) The next step into mystical states carries us into a realm\nthat public opinion and ethical philosophy have long since branded as\npathological, though private practice and certain lyric strains of poetry\nseem still to bear witness to its ideality. I refer to the consciousness\nproduced by intoxicants and an\u00e6sthetics, especially by alcohol. The sway\nof alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulate\nthe mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the\ncold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour. Sobriety diminishes,\ndiscriminates, and says no; drunkenness expands, unites, and says yes. It\nis in fact the great exciter of the _Yes_ function in man. It brings its\nvotary from the chill periphery of things to the radiant core. It makes\nhim for the moment one with truth. Not through mere perversity do men run\nafter it. To the poor and the unlettered it stands in the place of\nsymphony concerts and of literature; and it is part of the deeper mystery\nand tragedy of life that whiffs and gleams of something that we\nimmediately recognize as excellent should be vouchsafed to so many of us\nonly in the fleeting earlier phases of what in its totality is so\ndegrading a poisoning. The drunken consciousness is one bit of the mystic\nconsciousness, and our total opinion of it must find its place in our\nopinion of that larger whole.\nNitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide, when sufficiently\ndiluted with air, stimulate the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary\ndegree. Depth beyond depth of truth seems revealed to the inhaler. This\ntruth fades out, however, or escapes, at the moment of coming to; and if\nany words remain over in which it seemed to clothe itself, they prove to\nbe the veriest nonsense. Nevertheless, the sense of a profound meaning\nhaving been there persists; and I know more than one person who is\npersuaded that in the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysical\nrevelation.\nSome years ago I myself made some observations on this aspect of nitrous\noxide intoxication, and reported them in print. One conclusion was forced\nupon my mind at that time, and my impression of its truth has ever since\nremained unshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational\nconsciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness,\nwhilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie\npotential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through\nlife without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus,\nand at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of\nmentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and\nadaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which\nleaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard\nthem is the question,\u2014for they are so discontinuous with ordinary\nconsciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish\nformulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate,\nthey forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality. Looking back\non my own experiences, they all converge towards a kind of insight to\nwhich I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. The keynote\nof it is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the\nworld, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our difficulties and\ntroubles, were melted into unity. Not only do they, as contrasted species,\nbelong to one and the same genus, but _one of the species_, the nobler and\nbetter one, _is itself the genus, and so soaks up and absorbs its opposite\ninto itself_. This is a dark saying, I know, when thus expressed in terms\nof common logic, but I cannot wholly escape from its authority. I feel as\nif it must mean something, something like what the Hegelian philosophy\nmeans, if one could only lay hold of it more clearly. Those who have ears\nto hear, let them hear; to me the living sense of its reality only comes\nin the artificial mystic state of mind.(231)\nI just now spoke of friends who believe in the an\u00e6sthetic revelation. For\nthem too it is a monistic insight, in which the _other_ in its various\nforms appears absorbed into the One.\n\u201cInto this pervading genius,\u201d writes one of them, \u201cwe pass,\nforgetting and forgotten, and thenceforth each is all, in God.\nThere is no higher, no deeper, no other, than the life in which we\nare founded. \u2018The One remains, the many change and pass;\u2019 and each\nand every one of us _is_ the One that remains.... This is the\nultimatum.... As sure as being\u2014whence is all our care\u2014so sure is\ncontent, beyond duplexity, antithesis, or trouble, where I have\ntriumphed in a solitude that God is not above.\u201d(232)\nThis has the genuine religious mystic ring! I just now quoted J. A.\nSymonds. He also records a mystical experience with chloroform, as\nfollows:\u2014\n\u201cAfter the choking and stifling had passed away, I seemed at first\nin a state of utter blankness; then came flashes of intense light,\nalternating with blackness, and with a keen vision of what was\ngoing on in the room around me, but no sensation of touch. I\nthought that I was near death; when, suddenly, my soul became\naware of God, who was manifestly dealing with me, handling me, so\nto speak, in an intense personal present reality. I felt him\nstreaming in like light upon me.... I cannot describe the ecstasy\nI felt. Then, as I gradually awoke from the influence of the\nan\u00e6sthetics, the old sense of my relation to the world began to\nreturn, the new sense of my relation to God began to fade. I\nsuddenly leapt to my feet on the chair where I was sitting, and\nshrieked out, \u2018It is too horrible, it is too horrible, it is too\nhorrible,\u2019 meaning that I could not bear this disillusionment.\nThen I flung myself on the ground, and at last awoke covered with\nblood, calling to the two surgeons (who were frightened), \u2018Why did\nyou not kill me? Why would you not let me die?\u2019 Only think of it.\nTo have felt for that long dateless ecstasy of vision the very\nGod, in all purity and tenderness and truth and absolute love, and\nthen to find that I had after all had no revelation, but that I\nhad been tricked by the abnormal excitement of my brain.\n\u201cYet, this question remains, Is it possible that the inner sense\nof reality which succeeded, when my flesh was dead to impressions\nfrom without, to the ordinary sense of physical relations, was not\na delusion but an actual experience? Is it possible that I, in\nthat moment, felt what some of the saints have said they always\nfelt, the undemonstrable but irrefragable certainty of God?\u201d(233)\nWith this we make connection with religious mysticism pure and simple.\nSymonds\u2019s question takes us back to those examples which you will remember\nmy quoting in the lecture on the Reality of the Unseen, of sudden\nrealization of the immediate presence of God. The phenomenon in one shape\nor another is not uncommon.\n\u201cI know,\u201d writes Mr. Trine, \u201can officer on our police force who\nhas told me that many times when off duty, and on his way home in\nthe evening, there comes to him such a vivid and vital realization\nof his oneness with this Infinite Power, and this Spirit of\nInfinite Peace so takes hold of and so fills him, that it seems as\nif his feet could hardly keep to the pavement, so buoyant and so\nexhilarated does he become by reason of this inflowing tide.\u201d(234)\nCertain aspects of nature seem to have a peculiar power of awakening such\nmystical moods.(235) Most of the striking cases which I have collected\nhave occurred out of doors. Literature has commemorated this fact in many\npassages of great beauty\u2014this extract, for example, from Amiel\u2019s Journal\nIntime:\u2014\n\u201cShall I ever again have any of those prodigious reveries which\nsometimes came to me in former days? One day, in youth, at\nsunrise, sitting in the ruins of the castle of Faucigny; and again\nin the mountains, under the noonday sun, above Lavey, lying at the\nfoot of a tree and visited by three butterflies; once more at\nnight upon the shingly shore of the Northern Ocean, my back upon\nthe sand and my vision ranging through the milky way;\u2014such grand\nand spacious, immortal, cosmogonic reveries, when one reaches to\nthe stars, when one owns the infinite! Moments divine, ecstatic\nhours; in which our thought flies from world to world, pierces the\ngreat enigma, breathes with a respiration broad, tranquil, and\ndeep as the respiration of the ocean, serene and limitless as the\nblue firmament; ... instants of irresistible intuition in which\none feels one\u2019s self great as the universe, and calm as a god....\nWhat hours, what memories! The vestiges they leave behind are\nenough to fill us with belief and enthusiasm, as if they were\nvisits of the Holy Ghost.\u201d(236)\nHere is a similar record from the memoirs of that interesting German\nidealist, Malwida von Meysenbug:\u2014\n\u201cI was alone upon the seashore as all these thoughts flowed over\nme, liberating and reconciling; and now again, as once before in\ndistant days in the Alps of Dauphin\u00e9, I was impelled to kneel\ndown, this time before the illimitable ocean, symbol of the\nInfinite. I felt that I prayed as I had never prayed before, and\nknew now what prayer really is: to return from the solitude of\nindividuation into the consciousness of unity with all that is, to\nkneel down as one that passes away, and to rise up as one\nimperishable. Earth, heaven, and sea resounded as in one vast\nworld\u2010encircling harmony. It was as if the chorus of all the great\nwho had ever lived were about me. I felt myself one with them, and\nit appeared as if I heard their greeting: \u2018Thou too belongest to\nthe company of those who overcome.\u2019 \u201d(237)\nThe well\u2010known passage from Walt Whitman is a classical expression of this\nsporadic type of mystical experience.\n\u201cI believe in you, my Soul ...\nLoaf with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat;...\nOnly the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\nI mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning.\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that\npass all the argument of the earth,\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers and the women\nmy sisters and lovers,\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love.\u201d(238)\nI could easily give more instances, but one will suffice. I take it from\nthe Autobiography of J. Trevor.(239)\n\u201cOne brilliant Sunday morning, my wife and boys went to the\nUnitarian Chapel in Macclesfield. I felt it impossible to\naccompany them\u2014as though to leave the sunshine on the hills, and\ngo down there to the chapel, would be for the time an act of\nspiritual suicide. And I felt such need for new inspiration and\nexpansion in my life. So, very reluctantly and sadly, I left my\nwife and boys to go down into the town, while I went further up\ninto the hills with my stick and my dog. In the loveliness of the\nmorning, and the beauty of the hills and valleys, I soon lost my\nsense of sadness and regret. For nearly an hour I walked along the\nroad to the \u2018Cat and Fiddle,\u2019 and then returned. On the way back,\nsuddenly, without warning, I felt that I was in Heaven\u2014an inward\nstate of peace and joy and assurance indescribably intense,\naccompanied with a sense of being bathed in a warm glow of light,\nas though the external condition had brought about the internal\neffect\u2014a feeling of having passed beyond the body, though the\nscene around me stood out more clearly and as if nearer to me than\nbefore, by reason of the illumination in the midst of which I\nseemed to be placed. This deep emotion lasted, though with\ndecreasing strength, until I reached home, and for some time\nafter, only gradually passing away.\u201d\nThe writer adds that having had further experiences of a similar sort, he\nnow knows them well.\n\u201cThe spiritual life,\u201d he writes, \u201cjustifies itself to those who\nlive it; but what can we say to those who do not understand? This,\nat least, we can say, that it is a life whose experiences are\nproved real to their possessor, because they remain with him when\nbrought closest into contact with the objective realities of life.\nDreams cannot stand this test. We wake from them to find that they\nare but dreams. Wanderings of an overwrought brain do not stand\nthis test. These highest experiences that I have had of God\u2019s\npresence have been rare and brief\u2014flashes of consciousness which\nhave compelled me to exclaim with surprise\u2014God is _here_!\u2014or\nconditions of exaltation and insight, less intense, and only\ngradually passing away. I have severely questioned the worth of\nthese moments. To no soul have I named them, lest I should be\nbuilding my life and work on mere phantasies of the brain. But I\nfind that, after every questioning and test, they stand out to\u2010day\nas the most real experiences of my life, and experiences which\nhave explained and justified and unified all past experiences and\nall past growth. Indeed, their reality and their far\u2010reaching\nsignificance are ever becoming more clear and evident. When they\ncame, I was living the fullest, strongest, sanest, deepest life. I\nwas not seeking them. What I was seeking, with resolute\ndetermination, was to live more intensely my own life, as against\nwhat I knew would be the adverse judgment of the world. It was in\nthe most real seasons that the Real Presence came, and I was aware\nthat I was immersed in the infinite ocean of God.\u201d(240)\nEven the least mystical of you must by this time be convinced of the\nexistence of mystical moments as states of consciousness of an entirely\nspecific quality, and of the deep impression which they make on those who\nhave them. A Canadian psychiatrist, Dr. R. M. Bucke, gives to the more\ndistinctly characterized of these phenomena the name of cosmic\nconsciousness. \u201cCosmic consciousness in its more striking instances is\nnot,\u201d Dr. Bucke says, \u201csimply an expansion or extension of the self\u2010\nconscious mind with which we are all familiar, but the superaddition of a\nfunction as distinct from any possessed by the average man as\n_self_\u2010consciousness is distinct from any function possessed by one of the\nhigher animals.\u201d\n\u201cThe prime characteristic of cosmic consciousness is a\nconsciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the life and order of the\nuniverse. Along with the consciousness of the cosmos there occurs\nan intellectual enlightenment which alone would place the\nindividual on a new plane of existence\u2014would make him almost a\nmember of a new species. To this is added a state of moral\nexaltation, an indescribable feeling of elevation, elation, and\njoyousness, and a quickening of the moral sense, which is fully as\nstriking, and more important than is the enhanced intellectual\npower. With these come what may be called a sense of immortality,\na consciousness of eternal life, not a conviction that he shall\nhave this, but the consciousness that he has it already.\u201d(241)\nIt was Dr. Bucke\u2019s own experience of a typical onset of cosmic\nconsciousness in his own person which led him to investigate it in others.\nHe has printed his conclusions in a highly interesting volume, from which\nI take the following account of what occurred to him:\u2014\n\u201cI had spent the evening in a great city, with two friends,\nreading and discussing poetry and philosophy. We parted at\nmidnight. I had a long drive in a hansom to my lodging. My mind,\ndeeply under the influence of the ideas, images, and emotions\ncalled up by the reading and talk, was calm and peaceful. I was in\na state of quiet, almost passive enjoyment, not actually thinking,\nbut letting ideas, images, and emotions flow of themselves, as it\nwere, through my mind. All at once, without warning of any kind, I\nfound myself wrapped in a flame\u2010colored cloud. For an instant I\nthought of fire, an immense conflagration somewhere close by in\nthat great city; the next, I knew that the fire was within myself.\nDirectly afterward there came upon me a sense of exultation, of\nimmense joyousness accompanied or immediately followed by an\nintellectual illumination impossible to describe. Among other\nthings, I did not merely come to believe, but I saw that the\nuniverse is not composed of dead matter, but is, on the contrary,\na living Presence; I became conscious in myself of eternal life.\nIt was not a conviction that I would have eternal life, but a\nconsciousness that I possessed eternal life then; I saw that all\nmen are immortal; that the cosmic order is such that without any\nperadventure all things work together for the good of each and\nall; that the foundation principle of the world, of all the\nworlds, is what we call love, and that the happiness of each and\nall is in the long run absolutely certain. The vision lasted a few\nseconds and was gone; but the memory of it and the sense of the\nreality of what it taught has remained during the quarter of a\ncentury which has since elapsed. I knew that what the vision\nshowed was true. I had attained to a point of view from which I\nsaw that it must be true. That view, that conviction, I may say\nthat consciousness, has never, even during periods of the deepest\ndepression, been lost.\u201d(242)\nWe have now seen enough of this cosmic or mystic consciousness, as it\ncomes sporadically. We must next pass to its methodical cultivation as an\nelement of the religious life. Hindus, Buddhists, Mohammedans, and\nChristians all have cultivated it methodically.\nIn India, training in mystical insight has been known from time immemorial\nunder the name of yoga. Yoga means the experimental union of the\nindividual with the divine. It is based on persevering exercise; and the\ndiet, posture, breathing, intellectual concentration, and moral discipline\nvary slightly in the different systems which teach it. The yogi, or\ndisciple, who has by these means overcome the obscurations of his lower\nnature sufficiently, enters into the condition termed _sam\u00e2dhi_, \u201cand\ncomes face to face with facts which no instinct or reason can ever know.\u201d\nHe learns\u2014\n\u201cThat the mind itself has a higher state of existence, beyond\nreason, a superconscious state, and that when the mind gets to\nthat higher state, then this knowledge beyond reasoning comes....\nAll the different steps in yoga are intended to bring us\nscientifically to the superconscious state or sam\u00e2dhi.... Just as\nunconscious work is beneath consciousness, so there is another\nwork which is above consciousness, and which, also, is not\naccompanied with the feeling of egoism.... There is no feeling of\n_I_, and yet the mind works, desireless, free from restlessness,\nobjectless, bodiless. Then the Truth shines in its full\neffulgence, and we know ourselves\u2014for Sam\u00e2dhi lies potential in us\nall\u2014for what we truly are, free, immortal, omnipotent, loosed from\nthe finite, and its contrasts of good and evil altogether, and\nidentical with the Atman or Universal Soul.\u201d(243)\nThe Vedantists say that one may stumble into superconsciousness\nsporadically, without the previous discipline, but it is then impure.\nTheir test of its purity, like our test of religion\u2019s value, is empirical:\nits fruits must be good for life. When a man comes out of Sam\u00e2dhi, they\nassure us that he remains \u201cenlightened, a sage, a prophet, a saint, his\nwhole character changed, his life changed, illumined.\u201d(244)\nThe Buddhists use the word \u201csam\u00e2dhi\u201d as well as the Hindus; but \u201cdhy\u00e2na\u201d\nis their special word for higher states of contemplation. There seem to be\nfour stages recognized in dhy\u00e2na. The first stage comes through\nconcentration of the mind upon one point. It excludes desire, but not\ndiscernment or judgment: it is still intellectual. In the second stage the\nintellectual functions drop off, and the satisfied sense of unity remains.\nIn the third stage the satisfaction departs, and indifference begins,\nalong with memory and self\u2010consciousness. In the fourth stage the\nindifference, memory, and self\u2010consciousness are perfected. [Just what\n\u201cmemory\u201d and \u201cself\u2010consciousness\u201d mean in this connection is doubtful.\nThey cannot be the faculties familiar to us in the lower life.] Higher\nstages still of contemplation are mentioned\u2014a region where there exists\nnothing, and where the meditator says: \u201cThere exists absolutely nothing,\u201d\nand stops. Then he reaches another region where he says: \u201cThere are\nneither ideas nor absence of ideas,\u201d and stops again. Then another region\nwhere, \u201chaving reached the end of both idea and perception, he stops\nfinally.\u201d This would seem to be, not yet Nirv\u00e2na, but as close an approach\nto it as this life affords.(245)\nIn the Mohammedan world the Sufi sect and various dervish bodies are the\npossessors of the mystical tradition. The Sufis have existed in Persia\nfrom the earliest times, and as their pantheism is so at variance with the\nhot and rigid monotheism of the Arab mind, it has been suggested that\nSufism must have been inoculated into Islam by Hindu influences. We\nChristians know little of Sufism, for its secrets are disclosed only to\nthose initiated. To give its existence a certain liveliness in your minds,\nI will quote a Moslem document, and pass away from the subject.\nAl\u2010Ghazzali, a Persian philosopher and theologian, who flourished in the\neleventh century, and ranks as one of the greatest doctors of the Moslem\nchurch, has left us one of the few autobiographies to be found outside of\nChristian literature. Strange that a species of book so abundant among\nourselves should be so little represented elsewhere\u2014the absence of\nstrictly personal confessions is the chief difficulty to the purely\nliterary student who would like to become acquainted with the inwardness\nof religions other than the Christian.\nM. Schm\u00f6lders has translated a part of Al\u2010Ghazzali\u2019s autobiography into\nFrench:(246)\u2014\n\u201cThe Science of the Sufis,\u201d says the Moslem author, \u201caims at\ndetaching the heart from all that is not God, and at giving to it\nfor sole occupation the meditation of the divine being. Theory\nbeing more easy for me than practice, I read [certain books] until\nI understood all that can be learned by study and hearsay. Then I\nrecognized that what pertains most exclusively to their method is\njust what no study can grasp, but only transport, ecstasy, and the\ntransformation of the soul. How great, for example, is the\ndifference between knowing the definitions of health, of satiety,\nwith their causes and conditions, and being really healthy or\nfilled. How different to know in what drunkenness consists,\u2014as\nbeing a state occasioned by a vapor that rises from the\nstomach,\u2014and _being_ drunk effectively. Without doubt, the drunken\nman knows neither the definition of drunkenness nor what makes it\ninteresting for science. Being drunk, he knows nothing; whilst the\nphysician, although not drunk, knows well in what drunkenness\nconsists, and what are its predisposing conditions. Similarly\nthere is a difference between knowing the nature of abstinence,\nand _being_ abstinent or having one\u2019s soul detached from the\nworld.\u2014Thus I had learned what words could teach of Sufism, but\nwhat was left could be learned neither by study nor through the\nears, but solely by giving one\u2019s self up to ecstasy and leading a\npious life.\n\u201cReflecting on my situation, I found myself tied down by a\nmultitude of bonds\u2014temptations on every side. Considering my\nteaching, I found it was impure before God. I saw myself\nstruggling with all my might to achieve glory and to spread my\nname. [Here follows an account of his six months\u2019 hesitation to\nbreak away from the conditions of his life at Bagdad, at the end\nof which he fell ill with a paralysis of the tongue.] Then,\nfeeling my own weakness, and having entirely given up my own will,\nI repaired to God like a man in distress who has no more\nresources. He answered, as he answers the wretch who invokes him.\nMy heart no longer felt any difficulty in renouncing glory,\nwealth, and my children. So I quitted Bagdad, and reserving from\nmy fortune only what was indispensable for my subsistence, I\ndistributed the rest. I went to Syria, where I remained about two\nyears, with no other occupation than living in retreat and\nsolitude, conquering my desires, combating my passions, training\nmyself to purify my soul, to make my character perfect, to prepare\nmy heart for meditating on God\u2014all according to the methods of the\nSufis, as I had read of them.\n\u201cThis retreat only increased my desire to live in solitude, and to\ncomplete the purification of my heart and fit it for meditation.\nBut the vicissitudes of the times, the affairs of the family, the\nneed of subsistence, changed in some respects my primitive\nresolve, and interfered with my plans for a purely solitary life.\nI had never yet found myself completely in ecstasy, save in a few\nsingle hours; nevertheless, I kept the hope of attaining this\nstate. Every time that the accidents led me astray, I sought to\nreturn; and in this situation I spent ten years. During this\nsolitary state things were revealed to me which it is impossible\neither to describe or to point out. I recognized for certain that\nthe Sufis are assuredly walking in the path of God. Both in their\nacts and in their inaction, whether internal or external, they are\nillumined by the light which proceeds from the prophetic source.\nThe first condition for a Sufi is to purge his heart entirely of\nall that is not God. The next key of the contemplative life\nconsists in the humble prayers which escape from the fervent soul,\nand in the meditations on God in which the heart is swallowed up\nentirely. But in reality this is only the beginning of the Sufi\nlife, the end of Sufism being total absorption in God. The\nintuitions and all that precede are, so to speak, only the\nthreshold for those who enter. From the beginning, revelations\ntake place in so flagrant a shape that the Sufis see before them,\nwhilst wide awake, the angels and the souls of the prophets. They\nhear their voices and obtain their favors. Then the transport\nrises from the perception of forms and figures to a degree which\nescapes all expression, and which no man may seek to give an\naccount of without his words involving sin.\n\u201cWhoever has had no experience of the transport knows of the true\nnature of prophetism nothing but the name. He may meanwhile be\nsure of its existence, both by experience and by what he hears the\nSufis say. As there are men endowed only with the sensitive\nfaculty who reject what is offered them in the way of objects of\nthe pure understanding, so there are intellectual men who reject\nand avoid the things perceived by the prophetic faculty. A blind\nman can understand nothing of colors save what he has learned by\nnarration and hearsay. Yet God has brought prophetism near to men\nin giving them all a state analogous to it in its principal\ncharacters. This state is sleep. If you were to tell a man who was\nhimself without experience of such a phenomenon that there are\npeople who at times swoon away so as to resemble dead men, and who\n[in dreams] yet perceive things that are hidden, he would deny it\n[and give his reasons]. Nevertheless, his arguments would be\nrefuted by actual experience. Wherefore, just as the understanding\nis a stage of human life in which an eye opens to discern various\nintellectual objects uncomprehended by sensation; just so in the\nprophetic the sight is illumined by a light which uncovers hidden\nthings and objects which the intellect fails to reach. The chief\nproperties of prophetism are perceptible only during the\ntransport, by those who embrace the Sufi life. The prophet is\nendowed with qualities to which you possess nothing analogous, and\nwhich consequently you cannot possibly understand. How should you\nknow their true nature, since one knows only what one can\ncomprehend? But the transport which one attains by the method of\nthe Sufis is like an immediate perception, as if one touched the\nobjects with one\u2019s hand.\u201d(247)\nThis incommunicableness of the transport is the keynote of all mysticism.\nMystical truth exists for the individual who has the transport, but for no\none else. In this, as I have said, it resembles the knowledge given to us\nin sensations more than that given by conceptual thought. Thought, with\nits remoteness and abstractness, has often enough in the history of\nphilosophy been contrasted unfavorably with sensation. It is a commonplace\nof metaphysics that God\u2019s knowledge cannot be discursive but must be\nintuitive, that is, must be constructed more after the pattern of what in\nourselves is called immediate feeling, than after that of proposition and\njudgment. But _our_ immediate feelings have no content but what the five\nsenses supply; and we have seen and shall see again that mystics may\nemphatically deny that the senses play any part in the very highest type\nof knowledge which their transports yield.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn the Christian church there have always been mystics. Although many of\nthem have been viewed with suspicion, some have gained favor in the eyes\nof the authorities. The experiences of these have been treated as\nprecedents, and a codified system of mystical theology has been based upon\nthem, in which everything legitimate finds its place.(248) The basis of\nthe system is \u201corison\u201d or meditation, the methodical elevation of the soul\ntowards God. Through the practice of orison the higher levels of mystical\nexperience may be attained. It is odd that Protestantism, especially\nevangelical Protestantism, should seemingly have abandoned everything\nmethodical in this line. Apart from what prayer may lead to, Protestant\nmystical experience appears to have been almost exclusively sporadic. It\nhas been left to our mind\u2010curers to reintroduce methodical meditation into\nour religious life.\nThe first thing to be aimed at in orison is the mind\u2019s detachment from\nouter sensations, for these interfere with its concentration upon ideal\nthings. Such manuals as Saint Ignatius\u2019s Spiritual Exercises recommend the\ndisciple to expel sensation by a graduated series of efforts to imagine\nholy scenes. The acme of this kind of discipline would be a semi\u2010\nhallucinatory mono\u2010ideism\u2014an imaginary figure of Christ, for example,\ncoming fully to occupy the mind. Sensorial images of this sort, whether\nliteral or symbolic, play an enormous part in mysticism.(249) But in\ncertain cases imagery may fall away entirely, and in the very highest\nraptures it tends to do so. The state of consciousness becomes then\ninsusceptible of any verbal description. Mystical teachers are unanimous\nas to this. Saint John of the Cross, for instance, one of the best of\nthem, thus describes the condition called the \u201cunion of love,\u201d which, he\nsays, is reached by \u201cdark contemplation.\u201d In this the Deity compenetrates\nthe soul, but in such a hidden way that the soul\u2014\n\u201cfinds no terms, no means, no comparison whereby to render the\nsublimity of the wisdom and the delicacy of the spiritual feeling\nwith which she is filled.... We receive this mystical knowledge of\nGod clothed in none of the kinds of images, in none of the\nsensible representations, which our mind makes use of in other\ncircumstances. Accordingly in this knowledge, since the senses and\nthe imagination are not employed, we get neither form nor\nimpression, nor can we give any account or furnish any likeness,\nalthough the mysterious and sweet\u2010tasting wisdom comes home so\nclearly to the inmost parts of our soul. Fancy a man seeing a\ncertain kind of thing for the first time in his life. He can\nunderstand it, use and enjoy it, but he cannot apply a name to it,\nnor communicate any idea of it, even though all the while it be a\nmere thing of sense. How much greater will be his powerlessness\nwhen it goes beyond the senses! This is the peculiarity of the\ndivine language. The more infused, intimate, spiritual, and\nsupersensible it is, the more does it exceed the senses, both\ninner and outer, and impose silence upon them.... The soul then\nfeels as if placed in a vast and profound solitude, to which no\ncreated thing has access, in an immense and boundless desert,\ndesert the more delicious the more solitary it is. There, in this\nabyss of wisdom, the soul grows by what it drinks in from the\nwell\u2010springs of the comprehension of love, ... and recognizes,\nhowever sublime and learned may be the terms we employ, how\nutterly vile, insignificant, and improper they are, when we seek\nto discourse of divine things by their means.\u201d(250)\nI cannot pretend to detail to you the sundry stages of the Christian\nmystical life.(251) Our time would not suffice, for one thing; and\nmoreover, I confess that the subdivisions and names which we find in the\nCatholic books seem to me to represent nothing objectively distinct. So\nmany men, so many minds: I imagine that these experiences can be as\ninfinitely varied as are the idiosyncrasies of individuals.\nThe cognitive aspects of them, their value in the way of revelation, is\nwhat we are directly concerned with, and it is easy to show by citation\nhow strong an impression they leave of being revelations of new depths of\ntruth. Saint Teresa is the expert of experts in describing such\nconditions, so I will turn immediately to what she says of one of the\nhighest of them, the \u201corison of union.\u201d\n\u201cIn the orison of union,\u201d says Saint Teresa, \u201cthe soul is fully\nawake as regards God, but wholly asleep as regards things of this\nworld and in respect of herself. During the short time the union\nlasts, she is as it were deprived of every feeling, and even if\nshe would, she could not think of any single thing. Thus she needs\nto employ no artifice in order to arrest the use of her\nunderstanding: it remains so stricken with inactivity that she\nneither knows what she loves, nor in what manner she loves, nor\nwhat she wills. In short, she is utterly dead to the things of the\nworld and lives solely in God.... I do not even know whether in\nthis state she has enough life left to breathe. It seems to me she\nhas not; or at least that if she does breathe, she is unaware of\nit. Her intellect would fain understand something of what is going\non within her, but it has so little force now that it can act in\nno way whatsoever. So a person who falls into a deep faint appears\nas if dead....\n\u201cThus does God, when he raises a soul to union with himself,\nsuspend the natural action of all her faculties. She neither sees,\nhears, nor understands, so long as she is united with God. But\nthis time is always short, and it seems even shorter than it is.\nGod establishes himself in the interior of this soul in such a\nway, that when she returns to herself, it is wholly impossible for\nher to doubt that she has been in God, and God in her. This truth\nremains so strongly impressed on her that, even though many years\nshould pass without the condition returning, she can neither\nforget the favor she received, nor doubt of its reality. If you,\nnevertheless, ask how it is possible that the soul can see and\nunderstand that she has been in God, since during the union she\nhas neither sight nor understanding, I reply that she does not see\nit then, but that she sees it clearly later, after she has\nreturned to herself, not by any vision, but by a certitude which\nabides with her and which God alone can give her. I knew a person\nwho was ignorant of the truth that God\u2019s mode of being in\neverything must be either by presence, by power, or by essence,\nbut who, after having received the grace of which I am speaking,\nbelieved this truth in the most unshakable manner. So much so\nthat, having consulted a half\u2010learned man who was as ignorant on\nthis point as she had been before she was enlightened, when he\nreplied that God is in us only by \u2018grace,\u2019 she disbelieved his\nreply, so sure she was of the true answer; and when she came to\nask wiser doctors, they confirmed her in her belief, which much\nconsoled her....\n\u201cBut how, you will repeat, _can_ one have such certainty in\nrespect to what one does not see? This question, I am powerless to\nanswer. These are secrets of God\u2019s omnipotence which it does not\nappertain to me to penetrate. All that I know is that I tell the\ntruth; and I shall never believe that any soul who does not\npossess this certainty has ever been really united to God.\u201d(252)\nThe kinds of truth communicable in mystical ways, whether these be\nsensible or supersensible, are various. Some of them relate to this\nworld,\u2014visions of the future, the reading of hearts, the sudden\nunderstanding of texts, the knowledge of distant events, for example; but\nthe most important revelations are theological or metaphysical.\n\u201cSaint Ignatius confessed one day to Father Laynez that a single\nhour of meditation at Manresa had taught him more truths about\nheavenly things than all the teachings of all the doctors put\ntogether could have taught him.... One day in orison, on the steps\nof the choir of the Dominican church, he saw in a distinct manner\nthe plan of divine wisdom in the creation of the world. On another\noccasion, during a procession, his spirit was ravished in God, and\nit was given him to contemplate, in a form and images fitted to\nthe weak understanding of a dweller on the earth, the deep mystery\nof the holy Trinity. This last vision flooded his heart with such\nsweetness, that the mere memory of it in after times made him shed\nabundant tears.\u201d(253)\nSimilarly with Saint Teresa. \u201cOne day, being in orison,\u201d she\nwrites, \u201cit was granted me to perceive in one instant how all\nthings are seen and contained in God. I did not perceive them in\ntheir proper form, and nevertheless the view I had of them was of\na sovereign clearness, and has remained vividly impressed upon my\nsoul. It is one of the most signal of all the graces which the\nLord has granted me.... The view was so subtile and delicate that\nthe understanding cannot grasp it.\u201d(254)\nShe goes on to tell how it was as if the Deity were an enormous and\nsovereignly limpid diamond, in which all our actions were contained in\nsuch a way that their full sinfulness appeared evident as never before. On\nanother day, she relates, while she was reciting the Athanasian Creed,\u2014\n\u201cOur Lord made me comprehend in what way it is that one God can be\nin three Persons. He made me see it so clearly that I remained as\nextremely surprised as I was comforted, ... and now, when I think\nof the holy Trinity, or hear It spoken of, I understand how the\nthree adorable Persons form only one God and I experience an\nunspeakable happiness.\u201d\nOn still another occasion, it was given to Saint Teresa to see and\nunderstand in what wise the Mother of God had been assumed into her place\nin Heaven.(255)\nThe deliciousness of some of these states seems to be beyond anything\nknown in ordinary consciousness. It evidently involves organic\nsensibilities, for it is spoken of as something too extreme to be borne,\nand as verging on bodily pain.(256) But it is too subtle and piercing a\ndelight for ordinary words to denote. God\u2019s touches, the wounds of his\nspear, references to ebriety and to nuptial union have to figure in the\nphraseology by which it is shadowed forth. Intellect and senses both swoon\naway in these highest states of ecstasy. \u201cIf our understanding\ncomprehends,\u201d says Saint Teresa, \u201cit is in a mode which remains unknown to\nit, and it can understand nothing of what it comprehends. For my own part,\nI do not believe that it does comprehend, because, as I said, it does not\nunderstand itself to do so. I confess that it is all a mystery in which I\nam lost.\u201d(257) In the condition called _raptus_ or ravishment by\ntheologians, breathing and circulation are so depressed that it is a\nquestion among the doctors whether the soul be or be not temporarily\ndissevered from the body. One must read Saint Teresa\u2019s descriptions and\nthe very exact distinctions which she makes, to persuade one\u2019s self that\none is dealing, not with imaginary experiences, but with phenomena which,\nhowever rare, follow perfectly definite psychological types.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nTo the medical mind these ecstasies signify nothing but suggested and\nimitated hypnoid states, on an intellectual basis of superstition, and a\ncorporeal one of degeneration and hysteria. Undoubtedly these pathological\nconditions have existed in many and possibly in all the cases, but that\nfact tells us nothing about the value for knowledge of the consciousness\nwhich they induce. To pass a spiritual judgment upon these states, we must\nnot content ourselves with superficial medical talk, but inquire into\ntheir fruits for life.\nTheir fruits appear to have been various. Stupefaction, for one thing,\nseems not to have been altogether absent as a result. You may remember the\nhelplessness in the kitchen and schoolroom of poor Margaret Mary Alacoque.\nMany other ecstatics would have perished but for the care taken of them by\nadmiring followers. The \u201cother\u2010worldliness\u201d encouraged by the mystical\nconsciousness makes this over\u2010abstraction from practical life peculiarly\nliable to befall mystics in whom the character is naturally passive and\nthe intellect feeble; but in natively strong minds and characters we find\nquite opposite results. The great Spanish mystics, who carried the habit\nof ecstasy as far as it has often been carried, appear for the most part\nto have shown indomitable spirit and energy, and all the more so for the\ntrances in which they indulged.\nSaint Ignatius was a mystic, but his mysticism made him assuredly one of\nthe most powerfully practical human engines that ever lived. Saint John of\nthe Cross, writing of the intuitions and \u201ctouches\u201d by which God reaches\nthe substance of the soul, tells us that\u2014\n\u201cThey enrich it marvelously. A single one of them may be\nsufficient to abolish at a stroke certain imperfections of which\nthe soul during its whole life had vainly tried to rid itself, and\nto leave it adorned with virtues and loaded with supernatural\ngifts. A single one of these intoxicating consolations may reward\nit for all the labors undergone in its life\u2014even were they\nnumberless. Invested with an invincible courage, filled with an\nimpassioned desire to suffer for its God, the soul then is seized\nwith a strange torment\u2014that of not being allowed to suffer\nenough.\u201d(258)\nSaint Teresa is as emphatic, and much more detailed. You may perhaps\nremember a passage I quoted from her in my first lecture.(259) There are\nmany similar pages in her autobiography. Where in literature is a more\nevidently veracious account of the formation of a new centre of spiritual\nenergy, than is given in her description of the effects of certain\necstasies which in departing leave the soul upon a higher level of\nemotional excitement?\n\u201cOften, infirm and wrought upon with dreadful pains before the\necstasy, the soul emerges from it full of health and admirably\ndisposed for action ... as if God had willed that the body itself,\nalready obedient to the soul\u2019s desires, should share in the soul\u2019s\nhappiness.... The soul after such a favor is animated with a\ndegree of courage so great that if at that moment its body should\nbe torn to pieces for the cause of God, it would feel nothing but\nthe liveliest comfort. Then it is that promises and heroic\nresolutions spring up in profusion in us, soaring desires, horror\nof the world, and the clear perception of our proper\nnothingness.... What empire is comparable to that of a soul who,\nfrom this sublime summit to which God has raised her, sees all the\nthings of earth beneath her feet, and is captivated by no one of\nthem? How ashamed she is of her former attachments! How amazed at\nher blindness! What lively pity she feels for those whom she\nrecognizes still shrouded in the darkness!... She groans at having\never been sensitive to points of honor, at the illusion that made\nher ever see as honor what the world calls by that name. Now she\nsees in this name nothing more than an immense lie of which the\nworld remains a victim. She discovers, in the new light from\nabove, that in genuine honor there is nothing spurious, that to be\nfaithful to this honor is to give our respect to what deserves to\nbe respected really, and to consider as nothing, or as less than\nnothing, whatsoever perishes and is not agreeable to God.... She\nlaughs when she sees grave persons, persons of orison, caring for\npoints of honor for which she now feels profoundest contempt. It\nis suitable to the dignity of their rank to act thus, they\npretend, and it makes them more useful to others. But she knows\nthat in despising the dignity of their rank for the pure love of\nGod they would do more good in a single day than they would effect\nin ten years by preserving it.... She laughs at herself that there\nshould ever have been a time in her life when she made any case of\nmoney, when she ever desired it.... Oh! if human beings might only\nagree together to regard it as so much useless mud, what harmony\nwould then reign in the world! With what friendship we would all\ntreat each other if our interest in honor and in money could but\ndisappear from earth! For my own part, I feel as if it would be a\nremedy for all our ills.\u201d(260)\nMystical conditions may, therefore, render the soul more energetic in the\nlines which their inspiration favors. But this could be reckoned an\nadvantage only in case the inspiration were a true one. If the inspiration\nwere erroneous, the energy would be all the more mistaken and misbegotten.\nSo we stand once more before that problem of truth which confronted us at\nthe end of the lectures on saintliness. You will remember that we turned\nto mysticism precisely to get some light on truth. Do mystical states\nestablish the truth of those theological affections in which the saintly\nlife has its root?\nIn spite of their repudiation of articulate self\u2010description, mystical\nstates in general assert a pretty distinct theoretic drift. It is possible\nto give the outcome of the majority of them in terms that point in\ndefinite philosophical directions. One of these directions is optimism,\nand the other is monism. We pass into mystical states from out of ordinary\nconsciousness as from a less into a more, as from a smallness into a\nvastness, and at the same time as from an unrest to a rest. We feel them\nas reconciling, unifying states. They appeal to the yes\u2010function more than\nto the no\u2010function in us. In them the unlimited absorbs the limits and\npeacefully closes the account. Their very denial of every adjective you\nmay propose as applicable to the ultimate truth,\u2014He, the Self, the Atman,\nis to be described by \u201cNo! no!\u201d only, say the Upanishads,(261)\u2014though it\nseems on the surface to be a no\u2010function, is a denial made on behalf of a\ndeeper yes. Whoso calls the Absolute anything in particular, or says that\nit is _this_, seems implicitly to shut it off from being _that_\u2014it is as\nif he lessened it. So we deny the \u201cthis,\u201d negating the negation which it\nseems to us to imply, in the interests of the higher affirmative attitude\nby which we are possessed. The fountain\u2010head of Christian mysticism is\nDionysius the Areopagite. He describes the absolute truth by negatives\nexclusively.\n\u201cThe cause of all things is neither soul nor intellect; nor has it\nimagination, opinion, or reason, or intelligence; nor is it reason\nor intelligence; nor is it spoken or thought. It is neither\nnumber, nor order, nor magnitude, nor littleness, nor equality,\nnor inequality, nor similarity, nor dissimilarity. It neither\nstands, nor moves, nor rests.... It is neither essence, nor\neternity, nor time. Even intellectual contact does not belong to\nit. It is neither science nor truth. It is not even royalty or\nwisdom; not one; not unity; not divinity or goodness; nor even\nspirit as we know it,\u201d etc., _ad libitum_.(262)\nBut these qualifications are denied by Dionysius, not because the truth\nfalls short of them, but because it so infinitely excels them. It is above\nthem. It is _super_\u2010lucent, _super_\u2010splendent, _super_\u2010essential,\n_super_\u2010sublime, _super_ everything that can be named. Like Hegel in his\nlogic, mystics journey towards the positive pole of truth only by the\n\u201cMethode der Absoluten Negativit\u00e4t.\u201d(263)\nThus come the paradoxical expressions that so abound in mystical writings.\nAs when Eckhart tells of the still desert of the Godhead, \u201cwhere never was\nseen difference, neither Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost, where there is no\none at home, yet where the spark of the soul is more at peace than in\nitself.\u201d(264) As when Boehme writes of the Primal Love, that \u201cit may fitly\nbe compared to Nothing, for it is deeper than any Thing, and is as nothing\nwith respect to all things, forasmuch as it is not comprehensible by any\nof them. And because it is nothing respectively, it is therefore free from\nall things, and is that only good, which a man cannot express or utter\nwhat it is, there being nothing to which it may be compared, to express it\nby.\u201d(265) Or as when Angelus Silesius sings:\u2014\n\u201cGott ist ein lauter Nichts, ihn r\u00fchrt kein Nun noch Hier;\nJe mehr du nach ihm greiffst, je mehr entwind er dir.\u201d(266)\nTo this dialectical use, by the intellect, of negation as a mode of\npassage towards a higher kind of affirmation, there is correlated the\nsubtlest of moral counterparts in the sphere of the personal will. Since\ndenial of the finite self and its wants, since asceticism of some sort, is\nfound in religious experience to be the only doorway to the larger and\nmore blessed life, this moral mystery intertwines and combines with the\nintellectual mystery in all mystical writings.\n\u201cLove,\u201d continues Behmen, is Nothing, for \u201cwhen thou art gone\nforth wholly from the Creature and from that which is visible, and\nart become Nothing to all that is Nature and Creature, then thou\nart in that eternal One, which is God himself, and then thou shalt\nfeel within thee the highest virtue of Love.... The treasure of\ntreasures for the soul is where she goeth out of the Somewhat into\nthat Nothing out of which all things may be made. The soul here\nsaith, _I have nothing_, for I am utterly stripped and naked; _I\ncan do nothing_, for I have no manner of power, but am as water\npoured out; _I am nothing_, for all that I am is no more than an\nimage of Being, and only God is to me I AM; and so, sitting down\nin my own Nothingness, I give glory to the eternal Being, and\n_will nothing_ of myself, that so God may will all in me, being\nunto me my God and all things.\u201d(267)\nIn Paul\u2019s language, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. Only when\nI become as nothing can God enter in and no difference between his life\nand mine remain outstanding.(268)\nThis overcoming of all the usual barriers between the individual and the\nAbsolute is the great mystic achievement. In mystic states we both become\none with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness. This is the\neverlasting and triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by\ndifferences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in\nChristian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so\nthat there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought\nto make a critic stop and think, and which brings it about that the\nmystical classics have, as has been said, neither birthday nor native\nland. Perpetually telling of the unity of man with God, their speech\nantedates languages, and they do not grow old.(269)\n\u201cThat art Thou!\u201d say the Upanishads, and the Vedantists add: \u201cNot a part,\nnot a mode of That, but identically That, that absolute Spirit of the\nWorld.\u201d \u201cAs pure water poured into pure water remains the same, thus, O\nGautama, is the Self of a thinker who knows. Water in water, fire in fire,\nether in ether, no one can distinguish them; likewise a man whose mind has\nentered into the Self.\u201d(270) \u201c \u2018Every man,\u2019 says the Sufi Gulshan\u2010R\u00e2z,\n\u2018whose heart is no longer shaken by any doubt, knows with certainty that\nthere is no being save only One.... In his divine majesty the _me_, the\n_we_, the _thou_, are not found, for in the One there can be no\ndistinction. Every being who is annulled and entirely separated from\nhimself, hears resound outside of him this voice and this echo: _I am\nGod_: he has an eternal way of existing, and is no longer subject to\ndeath.\u2019 \u201d(271) In the vision of God, says Plotinus, \u201cwhat sees is not our\nreason, but something prior and superior to our reason.... He who thus\nsees does not properly see, does not distinguish or imagine two things. He\nchanges, he ceases to be himself, preserves nothing of himself. Absorbed\nin God, he makes but one with him, like a centre of a circle coinciding\nwith another centre.\u201d(272) \u201cHere,\u201d writes Suso, \u201cthe spirit dies, and yet\nis all alive in the marvels of the Godhead ... and is lost in the\nstillness of the glorious dazzling obscurity and of the naked simple\nunity. It is in this modeless _where_ that the highest bliss is to be\nfound.\u201d(273) \u201cIch bin so gross als Gott,\u201d sings Angelus Silesius again,\n\u201cEr ist als ich so klein; Er kann nicht \u00fcber mich, ich unter ihm nicht\nsein.\u201d(274)\nIn mystical literature such self\u2010contradictory phrases as \u201cdazzling\nobscurity,\u201d \u201cwhispering silence,\u201d \u201cteeming desert,\u201d are continually met\nwith. They prove that not conceptual speech, but music rather, is the\nelement through which we are best spoken to by mystical truth. Many\nmystical scriptures are indeed little more than musical compositions.\n\u201cHe who would hear the voice of Nada, \u2018the Soundless Sound,\u2019 and\ncomprehend it, he has to learn the nature of Dh\u00e2ran\u00e2.... When to\nhimself his form appears unreal, as do on waking all the forms he\nsees in dreams; when he has ceased to hear the many, he may\ndiscern the ONE\u2014the inner sound which kills the outer.... For then\nthe soul will hear, and will remember. And then to the inner ear\nwill speak THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE.... And now thy _Self_ is lost\nin SELF, _thyself_ unto THYSELF, merged in that SELF from which\nthou first didst radiate.... Behold! thou hast become the Light,\nthou hast become the Sound, thou art thy Master and thy God. Thou\nart THYSELF the object of thy search: the VOICE unbroken, that\nresounds throughout eternities, exempt from change, from sin\nexempt, the seven sounds in one, the VOICE OF THE SILENCE. _Om tat\nSat._\u201d(275)\nThese words, if they do not awaken laughter as you receive them, probably\nstir chords within you which music and language touch in common. Music\ngives us ontological messages which non\u2010musical criticism is unable to\ncontradict, though it may laugh at our foolishness in minding them. There\nis a verge of the mind which these things haunt; and whispers therefrom\nmingle with the operations of our understanding, even as the waters of the\ninfinite ocean send their waves to break among the pebbles that lie upon\nour shores.\n\u201cHere begins the sea that ends not till the world\u2019s end. Where we\nstand,\nCould we know the next high sea\u2010mark set beyond these waves that\ngleam,\nWe should know what never man hath known, nor eye of man hath\nscanned....\nAh, but here man\u2019s heart leaps, yearning towards the gloom with\nventurous glee,\nFrom the shore that hath no shore beyond it, set in all the\nsea.\u201d(276)\nThat doctrine, for example, that eternity is timeless, that our\n\u201cimmortality,\u201d if we live in the eternal, is not so much future as already\nnow and here, which we find so often expressed to\u2010day in certain\nphilosophic circles, finds its support in a \u201chear, hear!\u201d or an \u201camen,\u201d\nwhich floats up from that mysteriously deeper level.(277) We recognize the\npasswords to the mystical region as we hear them, but we cannot use them\nourselves; it alone has the keeping of \u201cthe password primeval.\u201d(278)\nI have now sketched with extreme brevity and insufficiency, but as fairly\nas I am able in the time allowed, the general traits of the mystic range\nof consciousness. _It is on the whole pantheistic and optimistic, or at\nleast the opposite of pessimistic. It is anti\u2010naturalistic, and harmonizes\nbest with twice\u2010bornness and so\u2010called other\u2010worldly states of mind._\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nMy next task is to inquire whether we can invoke it as authoritative. Does\nit furnish any _warrant for the truth_ of the twice\u2010bornness and\nsupernaturality and pantheism which it favors? I must give my answer to\nthis question as concisely as I can.\nIn brief my answer is this,\u2014and I will divide it into three parts:\u2014\n(1) Mystical states, when well developed, usually are, and have the right\nto be, absolutely authoritative over the individuals to whom they come.\n(2) No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for those\nwho stand outside of them to accept their revelations uncritically.\n(3) They break down the authority of the non\u2010mystical or rationalistic\nconsciousness, based upon the understanding and the senses alone. They\nshow it to be only one kind of consciousness. They open out the\npossibility of other orders of truth, in which, so far as anything in us\nvitally responds to them, we may freely continue to have faith.\nI will take up these points one by one.\n1.\nAs a matter of psychological fact, mystical states of a well\u2010pronounced\nand emphatic sort _are_ usually authoritative over those who have\nthem.(279) They have been \u201cthere,\u201d and know. It is vain for rationalism to\ngrumble about this. If the mystical truth that comes to a man proves to be\na force that he can live by, what mandate have we of the majority to order\nhim to live in another way? We can throw him into a prison or a madhouse,\nbut we cannot change his mind\u2014we commonly attach it only the more\nstubbornly to its beliefs.(280) It mocks our utmost efforts, as a matter\nof fact, and in point of logic it absolutely escapes our jurisdiction. Our\nown more \u201crational\u201d beliefs are based on evidence exactly similar in\nnature to that which mystics quote for theirs. Our senses, namely, have\nassured us of certain states of fact; but mystical experiences are as\ndirect perceptions of fact for those who have them as any sensations ever\nwere for us. The records show that even though the five senses be in\nabeyance in them, they are absolutely sensational in their epistemological\nquality, if I may be pardoned the barbarous expression,\u2014that is, they are\nface to face presentations of what seems immediately to exist.\nThe mystic is, in short, _invulnerable_, and must be left, whether we\nrelish it or not, in undisturbed enjoyment of his creed. Faith, says\nTolstoy, is that by which men live. And faith\u2010state and mystic state are\npractically convertible terms.\n2.\nBut I now proceed to add that mystics have no right to claim that we ought\nto accept the deliverance of their peculiar experiences, if we are\nourselves outsiders and feel no private call thereto. The utmost they can\never ask of us in this life is to admit that they establish a presumption.\nThey form a consensus and have an unequivocal outcome; and it would be\nodd, mystics might say, if such a unanimous type of experience should\nprove to be altogether wrong. At bottom, however, this would only be an\nappeal to numbers, like the appeal of rationalism the other way; and the\nappeal to numbers has no logical force. If we acknowledge it, it is for\n\u201csuggestive,\u201d not for logical reasons: we follow the majority because to\ndo so suits our life.\nBut even this presumption from the unanimity of mystics is far from being\nstrong. In characterizing mystic states as pantheistic, optimistic, etc.,\nI am afraid I over\u2010simplified the truth. I did so for expository reasons,\nand to keep the closer to the classic mystical tradition. The classic\nreligious mysticism, it now must be confessed, is only a \u201cprivileged\ncase.\u201d It is an _extract_, kept true to type by the selection of the\nfittest specimens and their preservation in \u201cschools.\u201d It is carved out\nfrom a much larger mass; and if we take the larger mass as seriously as\nreligious mysticism has historically taken itself, we find that the\nsupposed unanimity largely disappears. To begin with, even religious\nmysticism itself, the kind that accumulates traditions and makes schools,\nis much less unanimous than I have allowed. It has been both ascetic and\nantinomianly self\u2010indulgent within the Christian church.(281) It is\ndualistic in Sankhya, and monistic in Vedanta philosophy. I called it\npantheistic; but the great Spanish mystics are anything but pantheists.\nThey are with few exceptions non\u2010metaphysical minds, for whom \u201cthe\ncategory of personality\u201d is absolute. The \u201cunion\u201d of man with God is for\nthem much more like an occasional miracle than like an original\nidentity.(282) How different again, apart from the happiness common to\nall, is the mysticism of Walt Whitman, Edward Carpenter, Richard\nJefferies, and other naturalistic pantheists, from the more distinctively\nChristian sort.(283) The fact is that the mystical feeling of enlargement,\nunion, and emancipation has no specific intellectual content whatever of\nits own. It is capable of forming matrimonial alliances with material\nfurnished by the most diverse philosophies and theologies, provided only\nthey can find a place in their framework for its peculiar emotional mood.\nWe have no right, therefore, to invoke its prestige as distinctively in\nfavor of any special belief, such as that in absolute idealism, or in the\nabsolute monistic identity, or in the absolute goodness, of the world. It\nis only relatively in favor of all these things\u2014it passes out of common\nhuman consciousness in the direction in which they lie.\nSo much for religious mysticism proper. But more remains to be told, for\nreligious mysticism is only one half of mysticism. The other half has no\naccumulated traditions except those which the text\u2010books on insanity\nsupply. Open any one of these, and you will find abundant cases in which\n\u201cmystical ideas\u201d are cited as characteristic symptoms of enfeebled or\ndeluded states of mind. In delusional insanity, paranoia, as they\nsometimes call it, we may have a _diabolical_ mysticism, a sort of\nreligious mysticism turned upside down. The same sense of ineffable\nimportance in the smallest events, the same texts and words coming with\nnew meanings, the same voices and visions and leadings and missions, the\nsame controlling by extraneous powers; only this time the emotion is\npessimistic: instead of consolations we have desolations; the meanings are\ndreadful; and the powers are enemies to life. It is evident that from the\npoint of view of their psychological mechanism, the classic mysticism and\nthese lower mysticisms spring from the same mental level, from that great\nsubliminal or transmarginal region of which science is beginning to admit\nthe existence, but of which so little is really known. That region\ncontains every kind of matter: \u201cseraph and snake\u201d abide there side by\nside. To come from thence is no infallible credential. What comes must be\nsifted and tested, and run the gauntlet of confrontation with the total\ncontext of experience, just like what comes from the outer world of sense.\nIts value must be ascertained by empirical methods, so long as we are not\nmystics ourselves.\nOnce more, then, I repeat that non\u2010mystics are under no obligation to\nacknowledge in mystical states a superior authority conferred on them by\ntheir intrinsic nature.(284)\n3.\nYet, I repeat once more, the existence of mystical states absolutely\noverthrows the pretension of non\u2010mystical states to be the sole and\nultimate dictators of what we may believe. As a rule, mystical states\nmerely add a supersensuous meaning to the ordinary outward data of\nconsciousness. They are excitements like the emotions of love or ambition,\ngifts to our spirit by means of which facts already objectively before us\nfall into a new expressiveness and make a new connection with our active\nlife. They do not contradict these facts as such, or deny anything that\nour senses have immediately seized.(285) It is the rationalistic critic\nrather who plays the part of denier in the controversy, and his denials\nhave no strength, for there never can be a state of facts to which new\nmeaning may not truthfully be added, provided the mind ascend to a more\nenveloping point of view. It must always remain an open question whether\nmystical states may not possibly be such superior points of view, windows\nthrough which the mind looks out upon a more extensive and inclusive\nworld. The difference of the views seen from the different mystical\nwindows need not prevent us from entertaining this supposition. The wider\nworld would in that case prove to have a mixed constitution like that of\nthis world, that is all. It would have its celestial and its infernal\nregions, its tempting and its saving moments, its valid experiences and\nits counterfeit ones, just as our world has them; but it would be a wider\nworld all the same. We should have to use its experiences by selecting and\nsubordinating and substituting just as is our custom in this ordinary\nnaturalistic world; we should be liable to error just as we are now; yet\nthe counting in of that wider world of meanings, and the serious dealing\nwith it, might, in spite of all the perplexity, be indispensable stages in\nour approach to the final fullness of the truth.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn this shape, I think, we have to leave the subject. Mystical states\nindeed wield no authority due simply to their being mystical states. But\nthe higher ones among them point in directions to which the religious\nsentiments even of non\u2010mystical men incline. They tell of the supremacy of\nthe ideal, of vastness, of union, of safety, and of rest. They offer us\n_hypotheses_, hypotheses which we may voluntarily ignore, but which as\nthinkers we cannot possibly upset. The supernaturalism and optimism to\nwhich they would persuade us may, interpreted in one way or another, be\nafter all the truest of insights into the meaning of this life.\n\u201cOh, the little more, and how much it is; and the little less, and what\nworlds away!\u201d It may be that possibility and permission of this sort are\nall that the religious consciousness requires to live on. In my last\nlecture I shall have to try to persuade you that this is the case.\nMeanwhile, however, I am sure that for many of my readers this diet is too\nslender. If supernaturalism and inner union with the divine are true, you\nthink, then not so much permission, as compulsion to believe, ought to be\nfound. Philosophy has always professed to prove religious truth by\ncoercive argument; and the construction of philosophies of this kind has\nalways been one favorite function of the religious life, if we use this\nterm in the large historic sense. But religious philosophy is an enormous\nsubject, and in my next lecture I can only give that brief glance at it\nwhich my limits will allow.\nLECTURE XVIII. PHILOSOPHY.\nThe subject of Saintliness left us face to face with the question, Is the\nsense of divine presence a sense of anything objectively true? We turned\nfirst to mysticism for an answer, and found that although mysticism is\nentirely willing to corroborate religion, it is too private (and also too\nvarious) in its utterances to be able to claim a universal authority. But\nphilosophy publishes results which claim to be universally valid if they\nare valid at all, so we now turn with our question to philosophy. Can\nphilosophy stamp a warrant of veracity upon the religious man\u2019s sense of\nthe divine?\nI imagine that many of you at this point begin to indulge in guesses at\nthe goal to which I am tending. I have undermined the authority of\nmysticism, you say, and the next thing I shall probably do is to seek to\ndiscredit that of philosophy. Religion, you expect to hear me conclude, is\nnothing but an affair of faith, based either on vague sentiment, or on\nthat vivid sense of the reality of things unseen of which in my second\nlecture and in the lecture on Mysticism I gave so many examples. It is\nessentially private and individualistic; it always exceeds our powers of\nformulation; and although attempts to pour its contents into a philosophic\nmould will probably always go on, men being what they are, yet these\nattempts are always secondary processes which in no way add to the\nauthority, or warrant the veracity, of the sentiments from which they\nderive their own stimulus and borrow whatever glow of conviction they may\nthemselves possess. In short, you suspect that I am planning to defend\nfeeling at the expense of reason, to rehabilitate the primitive and\nunreflective, and to dissuade you from the hope of any Theology worthy of\nthe name.\nTo a certain extent I have to admit that you guess rightly. I do believe\nthat feeling is the deeper source of religion, and that philosophic and\ntheological formulas are secondary products, like translations of a text\ninto another tongue. But all such statements are misleading from their\nbrevity, and it will take the whole hour for me to explain to you exactly\nwhat I mean.\nWhen I call theological formulas secondary products, I mean that in a\nworld in which no religious feeling had ever existed, I doubt whether any\nphilosophic theology could ever have been framed. I doubt if dispassionate\nintellectual contemplation of the universe, apart from inner unhappiness\nand need of deliverance on the one hand and mystical emotion on the other,\nwould ever have resulted in religious philosophies such as we now possess.\nMen would have begun with animistic explanations of natural fact, and\ncriticised these away into scientific ones, as they actually have done. In\nthe science they would have left a certain amount of \u201cpsychical research,\u201d\neven as they now will probably have to re\u2010admit a certain amount. But\nhigh\u2010flying speculations like those of either dogmatic or idealistic\ntheology, these they would have had no motive to venture on, feeling no\nneed of commerce with such deities. These speculations must, it seems to\nme, be classed as over\u2010beliefs, buildings\u2010out performed by the intellect\ninto directions of which feeling originally supplied the hint.\nBut even if religious philosophy had to have its first hint supplied by\nfeeling, may it not have dealt in a superior way with the matter which\nfeeling suggested? Feeling is private and dumb, and unable to give an\naccount of itself. It allows that its results are mysteries and enigmas,\ndeclines to justify them rationally, and on occasion is willing that they\nshould even pass for paradoxical and absurd. Philosophy takes just the\nopposite attitude. Her aspiration is to reclaim from mystery and paradox\nwhatever territory she touches. To find an escape from obscure and wayward\npersonal persuasion to truth objectively valid for all thinking men has\never been the intellect\u2019s most cherished ideal. To redeem religion from\nunwholesome privacy, and to give public status and universal right of way\nto its deliverances, has been reason\u2019s task.\nI believe that philosophy will always have opportunity to labor at this\ntask.(286) We are thinking beings, and we cannot exclude the intellect\nfrom participating in any of our functions. Even in soliloquizing with\nourselves, we construe our feelings intellectually. Both our personal\nideals and our religious and mystical experiences must be interpreted\ncongruously with the kind of scenery which our thinking mind inhabits. The\nphilosophic climate of our time inevitably forces its own clothing on us.\nMoreover, we must exchange our feelings with one another, and in doing so\nwe have to speak, and to use general and abstract verbal formulas.\nConceptions and constructions are thus a necessary part of our religion;\nand as moderator amid the clash of hypotheses, and mediator among the\ncriticisms of one man\u2019s constructions by another, philosophy will always\nhave much to do. It would be strange if I disputed this, when these very\nlectures which I am giving are (as you will see more clearly from now\nonwards) a laborious attempt to extract from the privacies of religious\nexperience some general facts which can be defined in formulas upon which\neverybody may agree.\nReligious experience, in other words, spontaneously and inevitably\nengenders myths, superstitions, dogmas, creeds, and metaphysical\ntheologies, and criticisms of one set of these by the adherents of\nanother. Of late, impartial classifications and comparisons have become\npossible, alongside of the denunciations and anathemas by which the\ncommerce between creeds used exclusively to be carried on. We have the\nbeginnings of a \u201cScience of Religions,\u201d so\u2010called; and if these lectures\ncould ever be accounted a crumb\u2010like contribution to such a science, I\nshould be made very happy.\nBut all these intellectual operations, whether they be constructive or\ncomparative and critical, presuppose immediate experiences as their\nsubject\u2010matter. They are interpretative and inductive operations,\noperations after the fact, consequent upon religious feeling, not\nco\u00f6rdinate with it, not independent of what it ascertains.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe intellectualism in religion which I wish to discredit pretends to be\nsomething altogether different from this. It assumes to construct\nreligious objects out of the resources of logical reason alone, or of\nlogical reason drawing rigorous inference from non\u2010subjective facts. It\ncalls its conclusions dogmatic theology, or philosophy of the absolute, as\nthe case may be; it does not call them science of religions. It reaches\nthem in an a priori way, and warrants their veracity.\nWarranted systems have ever been the idols of aspiring souls. All\u2010\ninclusive, yet simple; noble, clean, luminous, stable, rigorous,\ntrue;\u2014what more ideal refuge could there be than such a system would offer\nto spirits vexed by the muddiness and accidentality of the world of\nsensible things? Accordingly, we find inculcated in the theological\nschools of to\u2010day, almost as much as in those of the fore\u2010time, a disdain\nfor merely possible or probable truth, and of results that only private\nassurance can grasp. Scholastics and idealists both express this disdain.\nPrincipal John Caird, for example, writes as follows in his Introduction\nto the Philosophy of Religion:\u2014\n\u201cReligion must indeed be a thing of the heart; but in order to\nelevate it from the region of subjective caprice and waywardness,\nand to distinguish between that which is true and false in\nreligion, we must appeal to an objective standard. That which\nenters the heart must first be discerned by the intelligence to be\n_true_. It must be seen as having in its own nature a _right_ to\ndominate feeling, and as constituting the principle by which\nfeeling must be judged.(287) In estimating the religious character\nof individuals, nations, or races, the first question is, not how\nthey feel, but what they think and believe\u2014not whether their\nreligion is one which manifests itself in emotions, more or less\nvehement and enthusiastic, but what are the _conceptions_ of God\nand divine things by which these emotions are called forth.\nFeeling is necessary in religion, but it is by the _content_ or\nintelligent basis of a religion, and not by feeling, that its\ncharacter and worth are to be determined.\u201d(288)\nCardinal Newman, in his work, The Idea of a University, gives more\nemphatic expression still to this disdain for sentiment.(289) Theology, he\nsays, is a science in the strictest sense of the word. I will tell you, he\nsays, what it is not\u2014not \u201cphysical evidences\u201d for God, not \u201cnatural\nreligion,\u201d for these are but vague subjective interpretations:\u2014\n\u201cIf,\u201d he continues, \u201cthe Supreme Being is powerful or skillful,\njust so far as the telescope shows power, or the microscope shows\nskill, if his moral law is to be ascertained simply by the\nphysical processes of the animal frame, or his will gathered from\nthe immediate issues of human affairs, if his Essence is just as\nhigh and deep and broad as the universe and no more; if this be\nthe fact, then will I confess that there is no specific science\nabout God, that theology is but a name, and a protest in its\nbehalf an hypocrisy. Then, pious as it is to think of Him, while\nthe pageant of experiment or abstract reasoning passes by, still\nsuch piety is nothing more than a poetry of thought, or an\nornament of language, a certain view taken of Nature which one man\nhas and another has not, which gifted minds strike out, which\nothers see to be admirable and ingenious, and which all would be\nthe better for adopting. It is but the theology of Nature, just as\nwe talk of the _philosophy_ or the _romance_ of history, or the\n_poetry_ of childhood, or the picturesque or the sentimental or\nthe humorous, or any other abstract quality which the genius or\nthe caprice of the individual, or the fashion of the day, or the\nconsent of the world, recognizes in any set of objects which are\nsubjected to its contemplation. I do not see much difference\nbetween avowing that there is no God, and implying that nothing\ndefinite can be known for certain about Him.\u201d\nWhat I mean by Theology, continues Newman, is none of these\nthings: \u201cI simply mean the _Science of God_, or the truths we know\nabout God, put into a system, just as we have a science of the\nstars and call it astronomy, or of the crust of the earth and call\nit geology.\u201d\nIn both these extracts we have the issue clearly set before us: Feeling\nvalid only for the individual is pitted against reason valid universally.\nThe test is a perfectly plain one of fact. Theology based on pure reason\nmust in point of fact convince men universally. If it did not, wherein\nwould its superiority consist? If it only formed sects and schools, even\nas sentiment and mysticism form them, how would it fulfill its programme\nof freeing us from personal caprice and waywardness? This perfectly\ndefinite practical test of the pretensions of philosophy to found religion\non universal reason simplifies my procedure to\u2010day. I need not discredit\nphilosophy by laborious criticism of its arguments. It will suffice if I\nshow that as a matter of history it fails to prove its pretension to be\n\u201cobjectively\u201d convincing. In fact, philosophy does so fail. It does not\nbanish differences; it founds schools and sects just as feeling does. I\nbelieve, in fact, that the logical reason of man operates in this field of\ndivinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or in patriotism, or\nin politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our\npassions or our mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds\narguments for our conviction, for indeed it _has_ to find them. It\namplifies and defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and\nplausibility. It hardly ever engenders it; it cannot now secure it.(290)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nLend me your attention while I run through some of the points of the older\nsystematic theology. You find them in both Protestant and Catholic\nmanuals, best of all in the innumerable text\u2010books published since Pope\nLeo\u2019s Encyclical recommending the study of Saint Thomas. I glance first at\nthe arguments by which dogmatic theology establishes God\u2019s existence,\nafter that at those by which it establishes his nature.(291)\nThe arguments for God\u2019s existence have stood for hundreds of years with\nthe waves of unbelieving criticism breaking against them, never totally\ndiscrediting them in the ears of the faithful, but on the whole slowly and\nsurely washing out the mortar from between their joints. If you have a God\nalready whom you believe in, these arguments confirm you. If you are\natheistic, they fail to set you right. The proofs are various. The\n\u201ccosmological\u201d one, so\u2010called, reasons from the contingence of the world\nto a First Cause which must contain whatever perfections the world itself\ncontains. The \u201cargument from design\u201d reasons, from the fact that Nature\u2019s\nlaws are mathematical, and her parts benevolently adapted to each other,\nthat this cause is both intellectual and benevolent. The \u201cmoral argument\u201d\nis that the moral law presupposes a lawgiver. The \u201cargument _ex consensu\ngentium_\u201d is that the belief in God is so widespread as to be grounded in\nthe rational nature of man, and should therefore carry authority with it.\nAs I just said, I will not discuss these arguments technically. The bare\nfact that all idealists since Kant have felt entitled either to scout or\nto neglect them shows that they are not solid enough to serve as\nreligion\u2019s all\u2010sufficient foundation. Absolutely impersonal reasons would\nbe in duty bound to show more general convincingness. Causation is indeed\ntoo obscure a principle to bear the weight of the whole structure of\ntheology. As for the argument from design, see how Darwinian ideas have\nrevolutionized it. Conceived as we now conceive them, as so many fortunate\nescapes from almost limitless processes of destruction, the benevolent\nadaptations which we find in Nature suggest a deity very different from\nthe one who figured in the earlier versions of the argument.(292)\nThe fact is that these arguments do but follow the combined suggestions of\nthe facts and of our feeling. They prove nothing rigorously. They only\ncorroborate our pre\u2010existent partialities.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIf philosophy can do so little to establish God\u2019s existence, how stands it\nwith her efforts to define his attributes? It is worth while to look at\nthe attempts of systematic theology in this direction.\nSince God is First Cause, this science of sciences says, he\ndiffers from all his creatures in possessing existence _a se_.\nFrom this \u201ca\u2010se\u2010ity\u201d on God\u2019s part, theology deduces by mere logic\nmost of his other perfections. For instance, he must be both\n_necessary_ and _absolute_, cannot not be, and cannot in any way\nbe determined by anything else. This makes Him absolutely\nunlimited from without, and unlimited also from within; for\nlimitation is non\u2010being; and God is being itself. This\nunlimitedness makes God infinitely perfect. Moreover, God is\n_One_, and _Only_, for the infinitely perfect can admit no peer.\nHe is _Spiritual_, for were He composed of physical parts, some\nother power would have to combine them into the total, and his\naseity would thus be contradicted. He is therefore both simple and\nnon\u2010physical in nature. He is _simple metaphysically_ also, that\nis to say, his nature and his existence cannot be distinct, as\nthey are in finite substances which share their formal natures\nwith one another, and are individual only in their material\naspect. Since God is one and only, his _essentia_ and his _esse_\nmust be given at one stroke. This excludes from his being all\nthose distinctions, so familiar in the world of finite things,\nbetween potentiality and actuality, substance and accidents, being\nand activity, existence and attributes. We can talk, it is true,\nof God\u2019s powers, acts, and attributes, but these discriminations\nare only \u201cvirtual,\u201d and made from the human point of view. In God\nall these points of view fall into an absolute identity of being.\nThis absence of all potentiality in God obliges Him to be\n_immutable_. He is actuality, through and through. Were there\nanything potential about Him, He would either lose or gain by its\nactualization, and either loss or gain would contradict his\nperfection. He cannot, therefore, change. Furthermore, He is\n_immense_, _boundless_; for could He be outlined in space, He\nwould be composite, and this would contradict his indivisibility.\nHe is therefore _omnipresent_, indivisibly there, at every point\nof space. He is similarly wholly present at every point of\ntime,\u2014in other words _eternal_. For if He began in time, He would\nneed a prior cause, and that would contradict his aseity. If He\nended, it would contradict his necessity. If He went through any\nsuccession, it would contradict his immutability.\nHe has _intelligence_ and _will_ and every other creature\u2010\nperfection, for _we_ have them, and _effectus nequit superare\ncausam_. In Him, however, they are absolutely and eternally in\nact, and their _object_, since God can be bounded by naught that\nis external, can primarily be nothing else than God himself. He\nknows himself, then, in one eternal indivisible act, and wills\nhimself with an infinite self\u2010pleasure.(293) Since He must of\nlogical necessity thus love and will himself, He cannot be called\n\u201cfree\u201d _ad intra_, with the freedom of contrarieties that\ncharacterizes finite creatures. _Ad extra_, however, or with\nrespect to his creation, God is free. He cannot _need_ to create,\nbeing perfect in being and in happiness already. He _wills_ to\ncreate, then, by an absolute freedom.\nBeing thus a substance endowed with intellect and will and\nfreedom, God is a _person_; and a _living_ person also, for He is\nboth object and subject of his own activity, and to be this\ndistinguishes the living from the lifeless. He is thus absolutely\n_self\u2010sufficient_: his _self\u2010knowledge_ and _self\u2010love_ are both\nof them infinite and adequate, and need no extraneous conditions\nto perfect them.\nHe is _omniscient_, for in knowing himself as Cause He knows all\ncreature things and events by implication. His knowledge is\n_previsive_, for He is present to all time. Even our free acts are\nknown beforehand to Him, for otherwise his wisdom would admit of\nsuccessive moments of enrichment, and this would contradict his\nimmutability. He is _omnipotent_ for everything that does not\ninvolve logical contradiction. He can make _being_\u2014in other words\nhis power includes _creation_. If what He creates were made of his\nown substance, it would have to be infinite in essence, as that\nsubstance is; but it is finite; so it must be non\u2010divine in\nsubstance. If it were made of a substance, an eternally existing\nmatter, for example, which God found there to his hand, and to\nwhich He simply gave its form, that would contradict God\u2019s\ndefinition as First Cause, and make Him a mere mover of something\ncaused already. The things he creates, then, He creates _ex\nnihilo_, and gives them absolute being as so many finite\nsubstances additional to himself. The forms which he imprints upon\nthem have their prototypes in his ideas. But as in God there is no\nsuch thing as multiplicity, and as these ideas for us are\nmanifold, we must distinguish the ideas as they are in God and the\nway in which our minds externally imitate them. We must attribute\nthem to Him only in a _terminative_ sense, as differing aspects,\nfrom the finite point of view, of his unique essence.\nGod of course is holy, good, and just. He can do no evil, for He\nis positive being\u2019s fullness, and evil is negation. It is true\nthat He has created physical evil in places, but only as a means\nof wider good, for _bonum totius pr\u00e6eminet bonum partis_. Moral\nevil He cannot will, either as end or means, for that would\ncontradict his holiness. By creating free beings He _permits_ it\nonly, neither his justice nor his goodness obliging Him to prevent\nthe recipients of freedom from misusing the gift.\nAs regards God\u2019s purpose in creating, primarily it can only have\nbeen to exercise his absolute freedom by the manifestation to\nothers of his glory. From this it follows that the others must be\nrational beings, capable in the first place of knowledge, love,\nand honor, and in the second place of happiness, for the knowledge\nand love of God is the mainspring of felicity. In so far forth one\nmay say that God\u2019s secondary purpose in creating is _love_.\nI will not weary you by pursuing these metaphysical determinations\nfarther, into the mysteries of God\u2019s Trinity, for example. What I have\ngiven will serve as a specimen of the orthodox philosophical theology of\nboth Catholics and Protestants. Newman, filled with enthusiasm at God\u2019s\nlist of perfections, continues the passage which I began to quote to you\nby a couple of pages of a rhetoric so magnificent that I can hardly\nrefrain from adding them, in spite of the inroad they would make upon our\ntime.(294) He first enumerates God\u2019s attributes sonorously, then\ncelebrates his ownership of everything in earth and Heaven, and the\ndependence of all that happens upon his permissive will. He gives us\nscholastic philosophy \u201ctouched with emotion,\u201d and every philosophy should\nbe touched with emotion to be rightly understood. Emotionally, then,\ndogmatic theology is worth something to minds of the type of Newman\u2019s. It\nwill aid us to estimate what it is worth intellectually, if at this point\nI make a short digression.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWhat God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. The Continental\nschools of philosophy have too often overlooked the fact that man\u2019s\nthinking is organically connected with his conduct. It seems to me to be\nthe chief glory of English and Scottish thinkers to have kept the organic\nconnection in view. The guiding principle of British philosophy has in\nfact been that every difference must _make_ a difference, every\ntheoretical difference somewhere issue in a practical difference, and that\nthe best method of discussing points of theory is to begin by ascertaining\nwhat practical difference would result from one alternative or the other\nbeing true. What is the particular truth in question _known as_? In what\nfacts does it result? What is its cash\u2010value in terms of particular\nexperience? This is the characteristic English way of taking up a\nquestion. In this way, you remember, Locke takes up the question of\npersonal identity. What you mean by it is just your chain of particular\nmemories, says he. That is the only concretely verifiable part of its\nsignificance. All further ideas about it, such as the oneness or manyness\nof the spiritual substance on which it is based, are therefore void of\nintelligible meaning; and propositions touching such ideas may be\nindifferently affirmed or denied. So Berkeley with his \u201cmatter.\u201d The cash\u2010\nvalue of matter is our physical sensations. That is what it is known as,\nall that we concretely verify of its conception. That, therefore, is the\nwhole meaning of the term \u201cmatter\u201d\u2014any other pretended meaning is mere\nwind of words. Hume does the same thing with causation. It is known as\nhabitual antecedence, and as tendency on our part to look for something\ndefinite to come. Apart from this practical meaning it has no significance\nwhatever, and books about it may be committed to the flames, says Hume.\nDugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, James Mill, John Mill, and Professor\nBain, have followed more or less consistently the same method; and\nShadworth Hodgson has used the principle with full explicitness. When all\nis said and done, it was English and Scotch writers, and not Kant, who\nintroduced \u201cthe critical method\u201d into philosophy, the one method fitted to\nmake philosophy a study worthy of serious men. For what seriousness can\npossibly remain in debating philosophic propositions that will never make\nan appreciable difference to us in action? And what could it matter, if\nall propositions were practically indifferent, which of them we should\nagree to call true or which false?\nAn American philosopher of eminent originality, Mr. Charles Sanders\nPeirce, has rendered thought a service by disentangling from the\nparticulars of its application the principle by which these men were\ninstinctively guided, and by singling it out as fundamental and giving to\nit a Greek name. He calls it the principle of _pragmatism_, and he defends\nit somewhat as follows:(295)\u2014\nThought in movement has for its only conceivable motive the attainment of\nbelief, or thought at rest. Only when our thought about a subject has\nfound its rest in belief can our action on the subject firmly and safely\nbegin. Beliefs, in short, are rules for action; and the whole function of\nthinking is but one step in the production of active habits. If there were\nany part of a thought that made no difference in the thought\u2019s practical\nconsequences, then that part would be no proper element of the thought\u2019s\nsignificance. To develop a thought\u2019s meaning we need therefore only\ndetermine what conduct it is fitted to produce; that conduct is for us its\nsole significance; and the tangible fact at the root of all our thought\u2010\ndistinctions is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in\nanything but a possible difference of practice. To attain perfect\nclearness in our thoughts of an object, we need then only consider what\nsensations, immediate or remote, we are conceivably to expect from it, and\nwhat conduct we must prepare in case the object should be true. Our\nconception of these practical consequences is for us the whole of our\nconception of the object, so far as that conception has positive\nsignificance at all.\nThis is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. Such a\nprinciple will help us on this occasion to decide, among the various\nattributes set down in the scholastic inventory of God\u2019s perfections,\nwhether some be not far less significant than others.\nIf, namely, we apply the principle of pragmatism to God\u2019s metaphysical\nattributes, strictly so called, as distinguished from his moral\nattributes, I think that, even were we forced by a coercive logic to\nbelieve them, we still should have to confess them to be destitute of all\nintelligible significance. Take God\u2019s aseity, for example; or his\nnecessariness; his immateriality; his \u201csimplicity\u201d or superiority to the\nkind of inner variety and succession which we find in finite beings, his\nindivisibility, and lack of the inner distinctions of being and activity,\nsubstance and accident, potentiality and actuality, and the rest; his\nrepudiation of inclusion in a genus; his actualized infinity; his\n\u201cpersonality,\u201d apart from the moral qualities which it may comport; his\nrelations to evil being permissive and not positive; his self\u2010sufficiency,\nself\u2010love, and absolute felicity in himself:\u2014candidly speaking, how do\nsuch qualities as these make any definite connection with our life? And if\nthey severally call for no distinctive adaptations of our conduct, what\nvital difference can it possibly make to a man\u2019s religion whether they be\ntrue or false?\nFor my own part, although I dislike to say aught that may grate upon\ntender associations, I must frankly confess that even though these\nattributes were faultlessly deduced, I cannot conceive of its being of the\nsmallest consequence to us religiously that any one of them should be\ntrue. Pray, what specific act can I perform in order to adapt myself the\nbetter to God\u2019s simplicity? Or how does it assist me to plan my behavior,\nto know that his happiness is anyhow absolutely complete? In the middle of\nthe century just past, Mayne Reid was the great writer of books of out\u2010of\u2010\ndoor adventure. He was forever extolling the hunters and field\u2010observers\nof living animals\u2019 habits, and keeping up a fire of invective against the\n\u201ccloset\u2010naturalists,\u201d as he called them, the collectors and classifiers,\nand handlers of skeletons and skins. When I was a boy, I used to think\nthat a closet\u2010naturalist must be the vilest type of wretch under the sun.\nBut surely the systematic theologians are the closet\u2010naturalists of the\ndeity, even in Captain Mayne Reid\u2019s sense. What is their deduction of\nmetaphysical attributes but a shuffling and matching of pedantic\ndictionary\u2010adjectives, aloof from morals, aloof from human needs,\nsomething that might be worked out from the mere word \u201cGod\u201d by one of\nthose logical machines of wood and brass which recent ingenuity has\ncontrived as well as by a man of flesh and blood. They have the trail of\nthe serpent over them. One feels that in the theologians\u2019 hands, they are\nonly a set of titles obtained by a mechanical manipulation of synonyms;\nverbality has stepped into the place of vision, professionalism into that\nof life. Instead of bread we have a stone; instead of a fish, a serpent.\nDid such a conglomeration of abstract terms give really the gist of our\nknowledge of the deity, schools of theology might indeed continue to\nflourish, but religion, vital religion, would have taken its flight from\nthis world. What keeps religion going is something else than abstract\ndefinitions and systems of concatenated adjectives, and something\ndifferent from faculties of theology and their professors. All these\nthings are after\u2010effects, secondary accretions upon those phenomena of\nvital conversation with the unseen divine, of which I have shown you so\nmany instances, renewing themselves _in s\u00e6cula s\u00e6culorum_ in the lives of\nhumble private men.\nSo much for the metaphysical attributes of God! From the point of view of\npractical religion, the metaphysical monster which they offer to our\nworship is an absolutely worthless invention of the scholarly mind.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWhat shall we now say of the attributes called moral? Pragmatically, they\nstand on an entirely different footing. They positively determine fear and\nhope and expectation, and are foundations for the saintly life. It needs\nbut a glance at them to show how great is their significance.\nGod\u2019s holiness, for example: being holy, God can will nothing but the\ngood. Being omnipotent, he can secure its triumph. Being omniscient, he\ncan see us in the dark. Being just, he can punish us for what he sees.\nBeing loving, he can pardon too. Being unalterable, we can count on him\nsecurely. These qualities enter into connection with our life, it is\nhighly important that we should be informed concerning them. That God\u2019s\npurpose in creation should be the manifestation of his glory is also an\nattribute which has definite relations to our practical life. Among other\nthings it has given a definite character to worship in all Christian\ncountries. If dogmatic theology really does prove beyond dispute that a\nGod with characters like these exists, she may well claim to give a solid\nbasis to religious sentiment. But verily, how stands it with her\narguments?\nIt stands with them as ill as with the arguments for his existence. Not\nonly do post\u2010Kantian idealists reject them root and branch, but it is a\nplain historic fact that they never have converted any one who has found\nin the moral complexion of the world, as he experienced it, reasons for\ndoubting that a good God can have framed it. To prove God\u2019s goodness by\nthe scholastic argument that there is no non\u2010being in his essence would\nsound to such a witness simply silly.\nNo! the book of Job went over this whole matter once for all and\ndefinitively. Ratiocination is a relatively superficial and unreal path to\nthe deity: \u201cI will lay mine hand upon my mouth; I have heard of Thee by\nthe hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee.\u201d An intellect\nperplexed and baffled, yet a trustful sense of presence\u2014such is the\nsituation of the man who is sincere with himself and with the facts, but\nwho remains religious still.(296)\nWe must therefore, I think, bid a definitive good\u2010by to dogmatic theology.\nIn all sincerity our faith must do without that warrant. Modern idealism,\nI repeat, has said good\u2010by to this theology forever. Can modern idealism\ngive faith a better warrant, or must she still rely on her poor self for\nwitness?\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe basis of modern idealism is Kant\u2019s doctrine of the Transcendental Ego\nof Apperception. By this formidable term Kant merely meant the fact that\nthe consciousness \u201cI think them\u201d must (potentially or actually) accompany\nall our objects. Former skeptics had said as much, but the \u201cI\u201d in question\nhad remained for them identified with the personal individual. Kant\nabstracted and depersonalized it, and made it the most universal of all\nhis categories, although for Kant himself the Transcendental Ego had no\ntheological implications.\nIt was reserved for his successors to convert Kant\u2019s notion of\n_Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt_, or abstract consciousness, into an infinite\nconcrete self\u2010consciousness which is the soul of the world, and in which\nour sundry personal self\u2010consciousnesses have their being. It would lead\nme into technicalities to show you even briefly how this transformation\nwas in point of fact effected. Suffice it to say that in the Hegelian\nschool, which to\u2010day so deeply influences both British and American\nthinking, two principles have borne the brunt of the operation.\nThe first of these principles is that the old logic of identity never\ngives us more than a post\u2010mortem dissection of _disjecta membra_, and that\nthe fullness of life can be construed to thought only by recognizing that\nevery object which our thought may propose to itself involves the notion\nof some other object which seems at first to negate the first one.\nThe second principle is that to be conscious of a negation is already\nvirtually to be beyond it. The mere asking of a question or expression of\na dissatisfaction proves that the answer or the satisfaction is already\nimminent; the finite, realized as such, is already the infinite _in\nposse_.\nApplying these principles, we seem to get a propulsive force into our\nlogic which the ordinary logic of a bare, stark self\u2010identity in each\nthing never attains to. The objects of our thought now _act_ within our\nthought, act as objects act when given in experience. They change and\ndevelop. They introduce something other than themselves along with them;\nand this other, at first only ideal or potential, presently proves itself\nalso to be actual. It supersedes the thing at first supposed, and both\nverifies and corrects it, in developing the fullness of its meaning.\nThe program is excellent; the universe _is_ a place where things are\nfollowed by other things that both correct and fulfill them; and a logic\nwhich gave us something like this movement of fact would express truth far\nbetter than the traditional school\u2010logic, which never gets of its own\naccord from anything to anything else, and registers only predictions and\nsubsumptions, or static resemblances and differences. Nothing could be\nmore unlike the methods of dogmatic theology than those of this new logic.\nLet me quote in illustration some passages from the Scottish\ntranscendentalist whom I have already named.\n\u201cHow are we to conceive,\u201d Principal Caird writes, \u201cof the reality\nin which all intelligence rests?\u201d He replies: \u201cTwo things may\nwithout difficulty be proved, viz., that this reality is an\nabsolute Spirit, and conversely that it is only in communion with\nthis absolute Spirit or Intelligence that the finite Spirit can\nrealize itself. It is absolute; for the faintest movement of human\nintelligence would be arrested, if it did not presuppose the\nabsolute reality of intelligence, of thought itself. Doubt or\ndenial themselves presuppose and indirectly affirm it. When I\npronounce anything to be true, I pronounce it, indeed, to be\nrelative to thought, but not to be relative to my thought, or to\nthe thought of any other individual mind. From the existence of\nall individual minds as such I can abstract; I can think them\naway. But that which I cannot think away is thought or self\u2010\nconsciousness itself, in its independence and absoluteness, or, in\nother words, an Absolute Thought or Self\u2010Consciousness.\u201d\nHere, you see, Principal Caird makes the transition which Kant did not\nmake: he converts the omnipresence of consciousness in general as a\ncondition of \u201ctruth\u201d being anywhere possible, into an omnipresent\nuniversal consciousness, which he identifies with God in his concreteness.\nHe next proceeds to use the principle that to acknowledge your limits is\nin essence to be beyond them; and makes the transition to the religious\nexperience of individuals in the following words:\u2014\n\u201cIf [Man] were only a creature of transient sensations and\nimpulses, of an ever coming and going succession of intuitions,\nfancies, feelings, then nothing could ever have for him the\ncharacter of objective truth or reality. But it is the prerogative\nof man\u2019s spiritual nature that he can yield himself up to a\nthought and will that are infinitely larger than his own. As a\nthinking, self\u2010conscious being, indeed, he may be said, by his\nvery nature, to live in the atmosphere of the Universal Life. As a\nthinking being, it is possible for me to suppress and quell in my\nconsciousness every movement of self\u2010assertion, every notion and\nopinion that is merely mine, every desire that belongs to me as\nthis particular Self, and to become the pure medium of a thought\nthat is universal\u2014in one word, to live no more my own life, but\nlet my consciousness be possessed and suffused by the Infinite and\nEternal life of spirit. And yet it is just in this renunciation of\nself that I truly gain myself, or realize the highest\npossibilities of my own nature. For whilst in one sense we give up\nself to live the universal and absolute life of reason, yet that\nto which we thus surrender ourselves is in reality our truer self.\nThe life of absolute reason is not a life that is foreign to us.\u201d\nNevertheless, Principal Caird goes on to say, so far as we are able\noutwardly to realize this doctrine, the balm it offers remains incomplete.\nWhatever we may be _in posse_, the very best of us _in actu_ falls very\nshort of being absolutely divine. Social morality, love, and self\u2010\nsacrifice even, merge our Self only in some other finite self or selves.\nThey do not quite identify it with the Infinite. Man\u2019s ideal destiny,\ninfinite in abstract logic, might thus seem in practice forever\nunrealizable.\n\u201cIs there, then,\u201d our author continues, \u201cno solution of the\ncontradiction between the ideal and the actual? We answer, There\nis such a solution, but in order to reach it we are carried beyond\nthe sphere of morality into that of religion. It may be said to be\nthe essential characteristic of religion as contrasted with\nmorality, that it changes aspiration into fruition, anticipation\ninto realization; that instead of leaving man in the interminable\npursuit of a vanishing ideal, it makes him the actual partaker of\na divine or infinite life. Whether we view religion from the human\nside or the divine\u2014as the surrender of the soul to God, or as the\nlife of God in the soul\u2014in either aspect it is of its very essence\nthat the Infinite has ceased to be a far\u2010off vision, and has\nbecome a present reality. The very first pulsation of the\nspiritual life, when we rightly apprehend its significance, is the\nindication that the division between the Spirit and its object has\nvanished, that the ideal has become real, that the finite has\nreached its goal and become suffused with the presence and life of\nthe Infinite.\n\u201cOneness of mind and will with the divine mind and will is not the\nfuture hope and aim of religion, but its very beginning and birth\nin the soul. To enter on the religious life is to terminate the\nstruggle. In that act which constitutes the beginning of the\nreligious life\u2014call it faith, or trust, or self\u2010surrender, or by\nwhatever name you will\u2014there is involved the identification of the\nfinite with a life which is eternally realized. It is true indeed\nthat the religious life is progressive; but understood in the\nlight of the foregoing idea, religious progress is not progress\n_towards_, but _within_ the sphere of the Infinite. It is not the\nvain attempt by endless finite additions or increments to become\npossessed of infinite wealth, but it is the endeavor, by the\nconstant exercise of spiritual activity, to appropriate that\ninfinite inheritance of which we are already in possession. The\nwhole future of the religious life is given in its beginning, but\nit is given implicitly. The position of the man who has entered on\nthe religious life is that evil, error, imperfection, do not\nreally belong to him: they are excrescences which have no organic\nrelation to his true nature: they are already virtually, as they\nwill be actually, suppressed and annulled, and in the very process\nof being annulled they become the means of spiritual progress.\nThough he is not exempt from temptation and conflict, [yet] in\nthat inner sphere in which his true life lies, the struggle is\nover, the victory already achieved. It is not a finite but an\ninfinite life which the spirit lives. Every pulse\u2010beat of its\n[existence] is the expression and realization of the life of\nGod.\u201d(297)\nYou will readily admit that no description of the phenomena of the\nreligious consciousness could be better than these words of your lamented\npreacher and philosopher. They reproduce the very rapture of those crises\nof conversion of which we have been hearing; they utter what the mystic\nfelt but was unable to communicate; and the saint, in hearing them,\nrecognizes his own experience. It is indeed gratifying to find the content\nof religion reported so unanimously. But when all is said and done, has\nPrincipal Caird\u2014and I only use him as an example of that whole mode of\nthinking\u2014transcended the sphere of feeling and of the direct experience of\nthe individual, and laid the foundations of religion in impartial reason?\nHas he made religion universal by coercive reasoning, transformed it from\na private faith into a public certainty? Has he rescued its affirmations\nfrom obscurity and mystery?\nI believe that he has done nothing of the kind, but that he has simply\nreaffirmed the individual\u2019s experiences in a more generalized vocabulary.\nAnd again, I can be excused from proving technically that the\ntranscendentalist reasonings fail to make religion universal, for I can\npoint to the plain fact that a majority of scholars, even religiously\ndisposed ones, stubbornly refuse to treat them as convincing. The whole of\nGermany, one may say, has positively rejected the Hegelian argumentation.\nAs for Scotland, I need only mention Professor Fraser\u2019s and Professor\nPringle\u2010Pattison\u2019s memorable criticisms, with which so many of you are\nfamiliar.(298) Once more, I ask, if transcendental idealism were as\nobjectively and absolutely rational as it pretends to be, could it\npossibly fail so egregiously to be persuasive?\nWhat religion reports, you must remember, always purports to be a fact of\nexperience: the divine is actually present, religion says, and between it\nand ourselves relations of give and take are actual. If definite\nperceptions of fact like this cannot stand upon their own feet, surely\nabstract reasoning cannot give them the support they are in need of.\nConceptual processes can class facts, define them, interpret them; but\nthey do not produce them, nor can they reproduce their individuality.\nThere is always a _plus_, a _thisness_, which feeling alone can answer\nfor. Philosophy in this sphere is thus a secondary function, unable to\nwarrant faith\u2019s veracity, and so I revert to the thesis which I announced\nat the beginning of this lecture.\nIn all sad sincerity I think we must conclude that the attempt to\ndemonstrate by purely intellectual processes the truth of the deliverances\nof direct religious experience is absolutely hopeless.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIt would be unfair to philosophy, however, to leave her under this\nnegative sentence. Let me close, then, by briefly enumerating what she\n_can_ do for religion. If she will abandon metaphysics and deduction for\ncriticism and induction, and frankly transform herself from theology into\nscience of religions, she can make herself enormously useful.\nThe spontaneous intellect of man always defines the divine which it feels\nin ways that harmonize with its temporary intellectual prepossessions.\nPhilosophy can by comparison eliminate the local and the accidental from\nthese definitions. Both from dogma and from worship she can remove\nhistoric incrustations. By confronting the spontaneous religious\nconstructions with the results of natural science, philosophy can also\neliminate doctrines that are now known to be scientifically absurd or\nincongruous.\nSifting out in this way unworthy formulations, she can leave a residuum of\nconceptions that at least are possible. With these she can deal as\n_hypotheses_, testing them in all the manners, whether negative or\npositive, by which hypotheses are ever tested. She can reduce their\nnumber, as some are found more open to objection. She can perhaps become\nthe champion of one which she picks out as being the most closely verified\nor verifiable. She can refine upon the definition of this hypothesis,\ndistinguishing between what is innocent over\u2010belief and symbolism in the\nexpression of it, and what is to be literally taken. As a result, she can\noffer mediation between different believers, and help to bring about\nconsensus of opinion. She can do this the more successfully, the better\nshe discriminates the common and essential from the individual and local\nelements of the religious beliefs which she compares.\nI do not see why a critical Science of Religions of this sort might not\neventually command as general a public adhesion as is commanded by a\nphysical science. Even the personally non\u2010religious might accept its\nconclusions on trust, much as blind persons now accept the facts of\noptics\u2014it might appear as foolish to refuse them. Yet as the science of\noptics has to be fed in the first instance, and continually verified\nlater, by facts experienced by seeing persons; so the science of religions\nwould depend for its original material on facts of personal experience,\nand would have to square itself with personal experience through all its\ncritical reconstructions. It could never get away from concrete life, or\nwork in a conceptual vacuum. It would forever have to confess, as every\nscience confesses, that the subtlety of nature flies beyond it, and that\nits formulas are but approximations. Philosophy lives in words, but truth\nand fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation.\nThere is in the living act of perception always something that glimmers\nand twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too\nlate. No one knows this as well as the philosopher. He must fire his\nvolley of new vocables out of his conceptual shotgun, for his profession\ncondemns him to this industry, but he secretly knows the hollowness and\nirrelevancy. His formulas are like stereoscopic or kinetoscopic\nphotographs seen outside the instrument; they lack the depth, the motion,\nthe vitality. In the religious sphere, in particular, belief that formulas\nare true can never wholly take the place of personal experience.\nIn my next lecture I will try to complete my rough description of\nreligious experience; and in the lecture after that, which is the last\none, I will try my own hand at formulating conceptually the truth to which\nit is a witness.\nLECTURE XIX. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS.\nWe have wound our way back, after our excursion through mysticism and\nphilosophy, to where we were before: the uses of religion, its uses to the\nindividual who has it, and the uses of the individual himself to the\nworld, are the best arguments that truth is in it. We return to the\nempirical philosophy: the true is what works well, even though the\nqualification \u201con the whole\u201d may always have to be added. In this lecture\nwe must revert to description again, and finish our picture of the\nreligious consciousness by a word about some of its other characteristic\nelements. Then, in a final lecture, we shall be free to make a general\nreview and draw our independent conclusions.\nThe first point I will speak of is the part which the \u00e6sthetic life plays\nin determining one\u2019s choice of a religion. Men, I said awhile ago,\ninvoluntarily intellectualize their religious experience. They need\nformulas, just as they need fellowship in worship. I spoke, therefore, too\ncontemptuously of the pragmatic uselessness of the famous scholastic list\nof attributes of the deity, for they have one use which I neglected to\nconsider. The eloquent passage in which Newman enumerates them(299) puts\nus on the track of it. Intoning them as he would intone a cathedral\nservice, he shows how high is their \u00e6sthetic value. It enriches our bare\npiety to carry these exalted and mysterious verbal additions just as it\nenriches a church to have an organ and old brasses, marbles and frescoes\nand stained windows. Epithets lend an atmosphere and overtones to our\ndevotion. They are like a hymn of praise and service of glory, and may\nsound the more sublime for being incomprehensible. Minds like\nNewman\u2019s(300) grow as jealous of their credit as heathen priests are of\nthat of the jewelry and ornaments that blaze upon their idols.\nAmong the buildings\u2010out of religion which the mind spontaneously indulges\nin, the \u00e6sthetic motive must never be forgotten. I promised to say nothing\nof ecclesiastical systems in these lectures. I may be allowed, however, to\nput in a word at this point on the way in which their satisfaction of\ncertain \u00e6sthetic needs contributes to their hold on human nature. Although\nsome persons aim most at intellectual purity and simplification, for\nothers _richness_ is the supreme imaginative requirement.(301) When one\u2019s\nmind is strongly of this type, an individual religion will hardly serve\nthe purpose. The inner need is rather of something institutional and\ncomplex, majestic in the hierarchic interrelatedness of its parts, with\nauthority descending from stage to stage, and at every stage objects for\nadjectives of mystery and splendor, derived in the last resort from the\nGodhead who is the fountain and culmination of the system. One feels then\nas if in presence of some vast incrusted work of jewelry or architecture;\none hears the multitudinous liturgical appeal; one gets the honorific\nvibration coming from every quarter. Compared with such a noble\ncomplexity, in which ascending and descending movements seem in no way to\njar upon stability, in which no single item, however humble, is\ninsignificant, because so many august institutions hold it in its place,\nhow flat does evangelical Protestantism appear, how bare the atmosphere of\nthose isolated religious lives whose boast it is that \u201cman in the bush\nwith God may meet.\u201d(302) What a pulverization and leveling of what a\ngloriously piled\u2010up structure! To an imagination used to the perspectives\nof dignity and glory, the naked gospel scheme seems to offer an almshouse\nfor a palace.\nIt is much like the patriotic sentiment of those brought up in ancient\nempires. How many emotions must be frustrated of their object, when one\ngives up the titles of dignity, the crimson lights and blare of brass, the\ngold embroidery, the plumed troops, the fear and trembling, and puts up\nwith a president in a black coat who shakes hands with you, and comes, it\nmay be, from a \u201chome\u201d upon a veldt or prairie with one sitting\u2010room and a\nBible on its centre\u2010table. It pauperizes the monarchical imagination!\nThe strength of these \u00e6sthetic sentiments makes it rigorously impossible,\nit seems to me, that Protestantism, however superior in spiritual\nprofundity it may be to Catholicism, should at the present day succeed in\nmaking many converts from the more venerable ecclesiasticism. The latter\noffers a so much richer pasturage and shade to the fancy, has so many\ncells with so many different kinds of honey, is so indulgent in its\nmultiform appeals to human nature, that Protestantism will always show to\nCatholic eyes the almshouse physiognomy. The bitter negativity of it is to\nthe Catholic mind incomprehensible. To intellectual Catholics many of the\nantiquated beliefs and practices to which the Church gives countenance\nare, if taken literally, as childish as they are to Protestants. But they\nare childish in the pleasing sense of \u201cchildlike\u201d\u2014innocent and amiable,\nand worthy to be smiled on in consideration of the undeveloped condition\nof the dear people\u2019s intellects. To the Protestant, on the contrary, they\nare childish in the sense of being idiotic falsehoods. He must stamp out\ntheir delicate and lovable redundancy, leaving the Catholic to shudder at\nhis literalness. He appears to the latter as morose as if he were some\nhard\u2010eyed, numb, monotonous kind of reptile. The two will never understand\neach other\u2014their centres of emotional energy are too different. Rigorous\ntruth and human nature\u2019s intricacies are always in need of a mutual\ninterpreter.(303) So much for the \u00e6sthetic diversities in the religious\nconsciousness.\nIn most books on religion, three things are represented as its most\nessential elements. These are Sacrifice, Confession, and Prayer. I must\nsay a word in turn of each of these elements, though briefly. First of\nSacrifice.\nSacrifices to gods are omnipresent in primeval worship; but, as cults have\ngrown refined, burnt offerings and the blood of he\u2010goats have been\nsuperseded by sacrifices more spiritual in their nature. Judaism, Islam,\nand Buddhism get along without ritual sacrifice; so does Christianity,\nsave in so far as the notion is preserved in transfigured form in the\nmystery of Christ\u2019s atonement. These religions substitute offerings of the\nheart, renunciations of the inner self, for all those vain oblations. In\nthe ascetic practices which Islam, Buddhism, and the older Christianity\nencourage we see how indestructible is the idea that sacrifice of some\nsort is a religious exercise. In lecturing on asceticism I spoke of its\nsignificance as symbolic of the sacrifices which life, whenever it is\ntaken strenuously, calls for.(304) But, as I said my say about those, and\nas these lectures expressly avoid earlier religious usages and questions\nof derivation, I will pass from the subject of Sacrifice altogether and\nturn to that of Confession.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nIn regard to Confession I will also be most brief, saying my word about it\npsychologically, not historically. Not nearly as widespread as sacrifice,\nit corresponds to a more inward and moral stage of sentiment. It is part\nof the general system of purgation and cleansing which one feels one\u2019s\nself in need of, in order to be in right relations to one\u2019s deity. For him\nwho confesses, shams are over and realities have begun; he has\nexteriorized his rottenness. If he has not actually got rid of it, he at\nleast no longer smears it over with a hypocritical show of virtue\u2014he lives\nat least upon a basis of veracity. The complete decay of the practice of\nconfession in Anglo\u2010Saxon communities is a little hard to account for.\nReaction against popery is of course the historic explanation, for in\npopery confession went with penances and absolution, and other\ninadmissible practices. But on the side of the sinner himself it seems as\nif the need ought to have been too great to accept so summary a refusal of\nits satisfaction. One would think that in more men the shell of secrecy\nwould have had to open, the pent\u2010in abscess to burst and gain relief, even\nthough the ear that heard the confession were unworthy. The Catholic\nchurch, for obvious utilitarian reasons, has substituted auricular\nconfession to one priest for the more radical act of public confession. We\nEnglish\u2010speaking Protestants, in the general self\u2010reliance and\nunsociability of our nature, seem to find it enough if we take God alone\ninto our confidence.(305)\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe next topic on which I must comment is Prayer,\u2014and this time it must be\nless briefly. We have heard much talk of late against prayer, especially\nagainst prayers for better weather and for the recovery of sick people. As\nregards prayers for the sick, if any medical fact can be considered to\nstand firm, it is that in certain environments prayer may contribute to\nrecovery, and should be encouraged as a therapeutic measure. Being a\nnormal factor of moral health in the person, its omission would be\ndeleterious. The case of the weather is different. Notwithstanding the\nrecency of the opposite belief,(306) every one now knows that droughts and\nstorms follow from physical antecedents, and that moral appeals cannot\navert them. But petitional prayer is only one department of prayer; and if\nwe take the word in the wider sense as meaning every kind of inward\ncommunion or conversation with the power recognized as divine, we can\neasily see that scientific criticism leaves it untouched.\nPrayer in this wide sense is the very soul and essence of religion.\n\u201cReligion,\u201d says a liberal French theologian, \u201cis an intercourse, a\nconscious and voluntary relation, entered into by a soul in distress with\nthe mysterious power upon which it feels itself to depend, and upon which\nits fate is contingent. This intercourse with God is realized by prayer.\nPrayer is religion in act; that is, prayer is real religion. It is prayer\nthat distinguishes the religious phenomenon from such similar or\nneighboring phenomena as purely moral or \u00e6sthetic sentiment. Religion is\nnothing if it be not the vital act by which the entire mind seeks to save\nitself by clinging to the principle from which it draws its life. This act\nis prayer, by which term I understand no vain exercise of words, no mere\nrepetition of certain sacred formul\u00e6, but the very movement itself of the\nsoul, putting itself in a personal relation of contact with the mysterious\npower of which it feels the presence,\u2014it may be even before it has a name\nby which to call it. Wherever this interior prayer is lacking, there is no\nreligion; wherever, on the other hand, this prayer rises and stirs the\nsoul, even in the absence of forms or of doctrines, we have living\nreligion. One sees from this why \u2018natural religion,\u2019 so\u2010called, is not\nproperly a religion. It cuts man off from prayer. It leaves him and God in\nmutual remoteness, with no intimate commerce, no interior dialogue, no\ninterchange, no action of God in man, no return of man to God. At bottom\nthis pretended religion is only a philosophy. Born at epochs of\nrationalism, of critical investigations, it never was anything but an\nabstraction. An artificial and dead creation, it reveals to its examiner\nhardly one of the characters proper to religion.\u201d(307)\nIt seems to me that the entire series of our lectures proves the truth of\nM. Sabatier\u2019s contention. The religious phenomenon, studied as an inner\nfact, and apart from ecclesiastical or theological complications, has\nshown itself to consist everywhere, and at all its stages, in the\nconsciousness which individuals have of an intercourse between themselves\nand higher powers with which they feel themselves to be related. This\nintercourse is realized at the time as being both active and mutual. If it\nbe not effective; if it be not a give and take relation; if nothing be\nreally transacted while it lasts; if the world is in no whit different for\nits having taken place; then prayer, taken in this wide meaning of a sense\nthat _something is transacting_, is of course a feeling of what is\nillusory, and religion must on the whole be classed, not simply as\ncontaining elements of delusion,\u2014these undoubtedly everywhere exist,\u2014but\nas being rooted in delusion altogether, just as materialists and atheists\nhave always said it was. At most there might remain, when the direct\nexperiences of prayer were ruled out as false witnesses, some inferential\nbelief that the whole order of existence must have a divine cause. But\nthis way of contemplating nature, pleasing as it would doubtless be to\npersons of a pious taste, would leave to them but the spectators\u2019 part at\na play, whereas in experimental religion and the prayerful life, we seem\nourselves to be actors, and not in a play, but in a very serious reality.\nThe genuineness of religion is thus indissolubly bound up with the\nquestion whether the prayerful consciousness be or be not deceitful. The\nconviction that something is genuinely transacted in this consciousness is\nthe very core of living religion. As to what is transacted, great\ndifferences of opinion have prevailed. The unseen powers have been\nsupposed, and are yet supposed, to do things which no enlightened man can\nnowadays believe in. It may well prove that the sphere of influence in\nprayer is subjective exclusively, and that what is immediately changed is\nonly the mind of the praying person. But however our opinion of prayer\u2019s\neffects may come to be limited by criticism, religion, in the vital sense\nin which these lectures study it, must stand or fall by the persuasion\nthat effects of some sort genuinely do occur. Through prayer, religion\ninsists, things which cannot be realized in any other manner come about:\nenergy which but for prayer would be bound is by prayer set free and\noperates in some part, be it objective or subjective, of the world of\nfacts.\nThis postulate is strikingly expressed in a letter written by the late\nFrederic W. H. Myers to a friend, who allows me to quote from it. It shows\nhow independent the prayer\u2010instinct is of usual doctrinal complications.\nMr. Myers writes:\u2014\n\u201cI am glad that you have asked me about prayer, because I have\nrather strong ideas on the subject. First consider what are the\nfacts. There exists around us a spiritual universe, and that\nuniverse is in actual relation with the material. From the\nspiritual universe comes the energy which maintains the material;\nthe energy which makes the life of each individual spirit. Our\nspirits are supported by a perpetual indrawal of this energy, and\nthe vigor of that indrawal is perpetually changing, much as the\nvigor of our absorption of material nutriment changes from hour to\nhour.\n\u201cI call these \u2018facts\u2019 because I think that some scheme of this\nkind is the only one consistent with our actual evidence; too\ncomplex to summarize here. How, then, should we _act_ on these\nfacts? Plainly we must endeavor to draw in as much spiritual life\nas possible, and we must place our minds in any attitude which\nexperience shows to be favorable to such indrawal. _Prayer_ is the\ngeneral name for that attitude of open and earnest expectancy. If\nwe then ask to _whom_ to pray, the answer (strangely enough) must\nbe that _that_ does not much matter. The prayer is not indeed a\npurely subjective thing;\u2014it means a real increase in intensity of\nabsorption of spiritual power or grace;\u2014but we do not know enough\nof what takes place in the spiritual world to know how the prayer\noperates;\u2014_who_ is cognizant of it, or through what channel the\ngrace is given. Better let children pray to Christ, who is at any\nrate the highest individual spirit of whom we have any knowledge.\nBut it would be rash to say that Christ himself _hears us_; while\nto say that _God_ hears us is merely to restate the first\nprinciple,\u2014that grace flows in from the infinite spiritual world.\u201d\nLet us reserve the question of the truth or falsehood of the belief that\npower is absorbed until the next lecture, when our dogmatic conclusions,\nif we have any, must be reached. Let this lecture still confine itself to\nthe description of phenomena; and as a concrete example of an extreme\nsort, of the way in which the prayerful life may still be led, let me take\na case with which most of you must be acquainted, that of George M\u00fcller of\nBristol, who died in 1898. M\u00fcller\u2019s prayers were of the crassest\npetitional order. Early in life he resolved on taking certain Bible\npromises in literal sincerity, and on letting himself be fed, not by his\nown worldly foresight, but by the Lord\u2019s hand. He had an extraordinarily\nactive and successful career, among the fruits of which were the\ndistribution of over two million copies of the Scripture text, in\ndifferent languages; the equipment of several hundred missionaries; the\ncirculation of more than a hundred and eleven million of scriptural books,\npamphlets, and tracts; the building of five large orphanages, and the\nkeeping and educating of thousands of orphans; finally, the establishment\nof schools in which over a hundred and twenty\u2010one thousand youthful and\nadult pupils were taught. In the course of this work Mr. M\u00fcller received\nand administered nearly a million and a half of pounds sterling, and\ntraveled over two hundred thousand miles of sea and land.(308) During the\nsixty\u2010eight years of his ministry, he never owned any property except his\nclothes and furniture, and cash in hand; and he left, at the age of\neighty\u2010six, an estate worth only a hundred and sixty pounds.\nHis method was to let his general wants be publicly known, but not\nto acquaint other people with the details of his temporary\nnecessities. For the relief of the latter, he prayed directly to\nthe Lord, believing that sooner or later prayers are always\nanswered if one have trust enough. \u201cWhen I lose such a thing as a\nkey,\u201d he writes, \u201cI ask the Lord to direct me to it, and I look\nfor an answer to my prayer; when a person with whom I have made an\nappointment does not come, according to the fixed time, and I\nbegin to be inconvenienced by it, I ask the Lord to be pleased to\nhasten him to me, and I look for an answer; when I do not\nunderstand a passage of the word of God, I lift up my heart to the\nLord that he would be pleased by his Holy Spirit to instruct me,\nand I expect to be taught, though I do not fix the time when, and\nthe manner how it should be; when I am going to minister in the\nWord, I seek help from the Lord, and ... am not cast down, but of\ngood cheer because I look for his assistance.\u201d\nM\u00fcller\u2019s custom was to never run up bills, not even for a week.\n\u201cAs the Lord deals out to us by the day, ... the week\u2019s payment\nmight become due and we have no money to meet it; and thus those\nwith whom we deal might be inconvenienced by us, and we be found\nacting against the commandment of the Lord: \u2018Owe no man anything.\u2019\nFrom this day and henceforward whilst the Lord gives to us our\nsupplies by the day, we purpose to pay at once for every article\nas it is purchased, and never to buy anything except we can pay\nfor it at once, however much it may seem to be needed, and however\nmuch those with whom we deal may wish to be paid only by the\nweek.\u201d\nThe articles needed of which M\u00fcller speaks were the food, fuel,\netc., of his orphanages. Somehow, near as they often come to going\nwithout a meal, they hardly ever seem actually to have done so.\n\u201cGreater and more manifest nearness of the Lord\u2019s presence I have\nnever had than when after breakfast there were no means for dinner\nfor more than a hundred persons; or when after dinner there were\nno means for the tea, and yet the Lord provided the tea; and all\nthis without one single human being having been informed about our\nneed.... Through Grace my mind is so fully assured of the\nfaithfulness of the Lord, that in the midst of the greatest need,\nI am enabled in peace to go about my other work. Indeed, did not\nthe Lord give me this, which is the result of trusting in him, I\nshould scarcely be able to work at all; for it is now\ncomparatively a rare thing that a day comes when I am not in need\nfor one or another part of the work.\u201d(309)\nIn building his orphanages simply by prayer and faith, M\u00fcller\naffirms that his prime motive was \u201cto have something to point to\nas a visible proof that our God and Father is the same faithful\nGod that he ever was,\u2014as willing as ever to prove himself the\nliving God, in our day as formerly, to all that put their trust in\nhim.\u201d(310) For this reason he refused to borrow money for any of\nhis enterprises. \u201cHow does it work when we thus anticipate God by\ngoing our own way? We certainly weaken faith instead of increasing\nit; and each time we work thus a deliverance of our own we find it\nmore and more difficult to trust in God, till at last we give way\nentirely to our natural fallen reason and unbelief prevails. How\ndifferent if one is enabled to wait God\u2019s own time, and to look\nalone to him for help and deliverance! When at last help comes,\nafter many seasons of prayer it may be, how sweet it is, and what\na present recompense! Dear Christian reader, if you have never\nwalked in this path of obedience before, do so now, and you will\nthen know experimentally the sweetness of the joy which results\nfrom it.\u201d(311)\nWhen the supplies came in but slowly, M\u00fcller always considered\nthat this was for the trial of his faith and patience. When his\nfaith and patience had been sufficiently tried, the Lord would\nsend more means. \u201cAnd thus it has proved,\u201d\u2014I quote from his\ndiary,\u2014\u201cfor to\u2010day was given me the sum of 2050 pounds, of which\n2000 are for the building fund [of a certain house], and 50 for\npresent necessities. It is impossible to describe my joy in God\nwhen I received this donation. I was neither excited nor\nsurprised; for I _look out_ for answers to my prayers. _I believe\nthat God hears me._ Yet my heart was so full of joy that I could\nonly _sit_ before God, and admire him, like David in 2 Samuel vii.\nAt last I cast myself flat down upon my face and burst forth in\nthanksgiving to God and in surrendering my heart afresh to him for\nhis blessed service.\u201d(312)\nGeorge M\u00fcller\u2019s is a case extreme in every respect, and in no respect more\nso than in the extraordinary narrowness of the man\u2019s intellectual horizon.\nHis God was, as he often said, his business partner. He seems to have been\nfor M\u00fcller little more than a sort of supernatural clergyman interested in\nthe congregation of tradesmen and others in Bristol who were his saints,\nand in the orphanages and other enterprises, but unpossessed of any of\nthose vaster and wilder and more ideal attributes with which the human\nimagination elsewhere has invested him. M\u00fcller, in short, was absolutely\nunphilosophical. His intensely private and practical conception of his\nrelations with the Deity continued the traditions of the most primitive\nhuman thought.(313) When we compare a mind like his with such a mind as,\nfor example, Emerson\u2019s or Phillips Brooks\u2019s, we see the range which the\nreligions consciousness covers.\nThere is an immense literature relating to answers to petitional prayer.\nThe evangelical journals are filled with such answers, and books are\ndevoted to the subject,(314) but for us M\u00fcller\u2019s case will suffice.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nA less sturdy beggar\u2010like fashion of leading the prayerful life is\nfollowed by innumerable other Christians. Persistence in leaning on the\nAlmighty for support and guidance will, such persons say, bring with it\nproofs, palpable but much more subtle, of his presence and active\ninfluence. The following description of a \u201cled\u201d life, by a German writer\nwhom I have already quoted, would no doubt appear to countless Christians\nin every country as if transcribed from their own personal experience. One\nfinds in this guided sort of life, says Dr. Hilty,\u2014\n\u201cThat books and words (and sometimes people) come to one\u2019s\ncognizance just at the very moment in which one needs them; that\none glides over great dangers as if with shut eyes, remaining\nignorant of what would have terrified one or led one astray, until\nthe peril is past\u2014this being especially the case with temptations\nto vanity and sensuality; that paths on which one ought not to\nwander are, as it were, hedged off with thorns; but that on the\nother side great obstacles are suddenly removed; that when the\ntime has come for something, one suddenly receives a courage that\nformerly failed, or perceives the root of a matter that until then\nwas concealed, or discovers thoughts, talents, yea, even pieces of\nknowledge and insight, in one\u2019s self, of which it is impossible to\nsay whence they come; finally, that persons help us or decline to\nhelp us, favor us or refuse us, as if they had to do so against\ntheir will, so that often those indifferent or even unfriendly to\nus yield us the greatest service and furtherance. (God takes often\ntheir worldly goods, from those whom he leads, at just the right\nmoment, when they threaten to impede the effort after higher\ninterests.)\n\u201cBesides all this, other noteworthy things come to pass, of which\nit is not easy to give account. There is no doubt whatever that\nnow one walks continually through \u2018open doors\u2019 and on the easiest\nroads, with as little care and trouble as it is possible to\nimagine.\n\u201cFurthermore one finds one\u2019s self settling one\u2019s affairs neither\ntoo early nor too late, whereas they were wont to be spoiled by\nuntimeliness, even when the preparations had been well laid. In\naddition to this, one does them with perfect tranquillity of mind,\nalmost as if they were matters of no consequence, like errands\ndone by us for another person, in which case we usually act more\ncalmly than when we act in our own concerns. Again, one finds that\none can _wait_ for everything patiently, and that is one of life\u2019s\ngreat arts. One finds also that each thing comes duly, one thing\nafter the other, so that one gains time to make one\u2019s footing sure\nbefore advancing farther. And then everything occurs to us at the\nright moment, just what we ought to do, etc., and often in a very\nstriking way, just as if a third person were keeping watch over\nthose things which we are in easy danger of forgetting.\n\u201cOften, too, persons are sent to us at the right time, to offer or\nask for what is needed, and what we should never have had the\ncourage or resolution to undertake of our own accord.\n\u201cThrough all these experiences one finds that one is kindly and\ntolerant of other people, even of such as are repulsive,\nnegligent, or ill\u2010willed, for they also are instruments of good in\nGod\u2019s hand, and often most efficient ones. Without these thoughts\nit would be hard for even the best of us always to keep our\nequanimity. But with the consciousness of divine guidance, one\nsees many a thing in life quite differently from what would\notherwise be possible.\n\u201cAll these are things that every human being _knows_, who has had\nexperience of them; and of which the most speaking examples could\nbe brought forward. The highest resources of worldly wisdom are\nunable to attain that which, under divine leading, comes to us of\nits own accord.\u201d(315)\nSuch accounts as this shade away into others where the belief is, not that\nparticular events are tempered more towardly to us by a superintending\nprovidence, as a reward for our reliance, but that by cultivating the\ncontinuous sense of our connection with the power that made things as they\nare, we are tempered more towardly for their reception. The outward face\nof nature need not alter, but the expressions of meaning in it alter. It\nwas dead and is alive again. It is like the difference between looking on\na person without love, or upon the same person with love. In the latter\ncase intercourse springs into new vitality. So when one\u2019s affections keep\nin touch with the divinity of the world\u2019s authorship, fear and egotism\nfall away; and in the equanimity that follows, one finds in the hours, as\nthey succeed each other, a series of purely benignant opportunities. It is\nas if all doors were opened, and all paths freshly smoothed. We meet a new\nworld when we meet the old world in the spirit which this kind of prayer\ninfuses.\nSuch a spirit was that of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.(316) It is that\nof mind\u2010curers, of the transcendentalists, and of the so\u2010called \u201cliberal\u201d\nChristians. As an expression of it, I will quote a page from one of\nMartineau\u2019s sermons:\u2014\n\u201cThe universe, open to the eye to\u2010day, looks as it did a thousand\nyears ago: and the morning hymn of Milton does but tell the beauty\nwith which our own familiar sun dressed the earliest fields and\ngardens of the world. We see what all our fathers saw. And if we\ncannot find God in your house or in mine, upon the roadside or the\nmargin of the sea; in the bursting seed or opening flower; in the\nday duty or the night musing; in the general laugh and the secret\ngrief; in the procession of life, ever entering afresh, and\nsolemnly passing by and dropping off; I do not think we should\ndiscern him any more on the grass of Eden, or beneath the\nmoonlight of Gethsemane. Depend upon it, it is not the want of\ngreater miracles, but of the soul to perceive such as are allowed\nus still, that makes us push all the sanctities into the far\nspaces we cannot reach. The devout feel that wherever God\u2019s hand\nis, _there_ is miracle: and it is simply an indevoutness which\nimagines that only where miracle is, can there be the real hand of\nGod. The customs of Heaven ought surely to be more sacred in our\neyes than its anomalies; the dear old ways, of which the Most High\nis never tired, than the strange things which he does not love\nwell enough ever to repeat. And he who will but discern beneath\nthe sun, as he rises any morning, the supporting finger of the\nAlmighty, may recover the sweet and reverent surprise with which\nAdam gazed on the first dawn in Paradise. It is no outward change,\nno shifting in time or place; but only the loving meditation of\nthe pure in heart, that can reawaken the Eternal from the sleep\nwithin our souls: that can render him a reality again, and\nreassert for him once more his ancient name of \u2018the Living\nGod.\u2019 \u201d(317)\nWhen we see all things in God, and refer all things to him, we read in\ncommon matters superior expressions of meaning. The deadness with which\ncustom invests the familiar vanishes, and existence as a whole appears\ntransfigured. The state of a mind thus awakened from torpor is well\nexpressed in these words, which I take from a friend\u2019s letter:\u2014\n\u201cIf we occupy ourselves in summing up all the mercies and bounties\nwe are privileged to have, we are overwhelmed by their number (so\ngreat that we can imagine ourselves unable to give ourselves time\neven to begin to review the things we may imagine _we have not_).\nWe sum them and realize that _we are actually killed with God\u2019s\nkindness_; that we are surrounded by bounties upon bounties,\nwithout which all would fall. Should we not love it; should we not\nfeel buoyed up by the Eternal Arms?\u201d\nSometimes this realization that facts are of divine sending, instead of\nbeing habitual, is casual, like a mystical experience. Father Gratry gives\nthis instance from his youthful melancholy period:\u2014\n\u201cOne day I had a moment of consolation, because I met with\nsomething which seemed to me ideally perfect. It was a poor\ndrummer beating the tattoo in the streets of Paris. I walked\nbehind him in returning to the school on the evening of a holiday.\nHis drum gave out the tattoo in such a way that, at that moment at\nleast, however peevish I were, I could find no pretext for fault\u2010\nfinding. It was impossible to conceive more nerve or spirit,\nbetter time or measure, more clearness or richness, than were in\nthis drumming. Ideal desire could go no farther in that direction.\nI was enchanted and consoled; the perfection of this wretched act\ndid me good. Good is at least possible, I said, since the ideal\ncan thus sometimes get embodied.\u201d(318)\nIn S\u00e9nancour\u2019s novel of Obermann a similar transient lifting of the veil\nis recorded. In Paris streets, on a March day, he comes across a flower in\nbloom, a jonquil:\n\u201cIt was the strongest expression of desire: it was the first\nperfume of the year. I felt all the happiness destined for man.\nThis unutterable harmony of souls, the phantom of the ideal world,\narose in me complete. I never felt anything so great or so\ninstantaneous. I know not what shape, what analogy, what secret of\nrelation it was that made me see in this flower a limitless\nbeauty.... I shall never inclose in a conception this power, this\nimmensity that nothing will express; this form that nothing will\ncontain; this ideal of a better world which one feels, but which,\nit seems, nature has not made actual.\u201d(319)\nWe heard in previous lectures of the vivified face of the world as it may\nappear to converts after their awakening.(320) As a rule, religious\npersons generally assume that whatever natural facts connect themselves in\nany way with their destiny are significant of the divine purposes with\nthem. Through prayer the purpose, often far from obvious, comes home to\nthem, and if it be \u201ctrial,\u201d strength to endure the trial is given. Thus at\nall stages of the prayerful life we find the persuasion that in the\nprocess of communion energy from on high flows in to meet demand, and\nbecomes operative within the phenomenal world. So long as this\noperativeness is admitted to be real, it makes no essential difference\nwhether its immediate effects be subjective or objective. The fundamental\nreligious point is that in prayer, spiritual energy, which otherwise would\nslumber, does become active, and spiritual work of some kind is effected\nreally.\nSo much for Prayer, taken in the wide sense of any kind of communion. As\nthe core of religion, we must return to it in the next lecture.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe last aspect of the religious life which remains for me to touch upon\nis the fact that its manifestations so frequently connect themselves with\nthe subconscious part of our existence. You may remember what I said in my\nopening lecture(321) about the prevalence of the psychopathic temperament\nin religious biography. You will in point of fact hardly find a religious\nleader of any kind in whose life there is no record of automatisms. I\nspeak not merely of savage priests and prophets, whose followers regard\nautomatic utterance and action as by itself tantamount to inspiration, I\nspeak of leaders of thought and subjects of intellectualized experience.\nSaint Paul had his visions, his ecstasies, his gift of tongues, small as\nwas the importance he attached to the latter. The whole array of Christian\nsaints and heresiarchs, including the greatest, the Bernards, the Loyolas,\nthe Luthers, the Foxes, the Wesleys, had their visions, voices, rapt\nconditions, guiding impressions, and \u201copenings.\u201d They had these things,\nbecause they had exalted sensibility, and to such things persons of\nexalted sensibility are liable. In such liability there lie, however,\nconsequences for theology. Beliefs are strengthened wherever automatisms\ncorroborate them. Incursions from beyond the transmarginal region have a\npeculiar power to increase conviction. The inchoate sense of presence is\ninfinitely stronger than conception, but strong as it may be, it is seldom\nequal to the evidence of hallucination. Saints who actually see or hear\ntheir Saviour reach the acme of assurance. Motor automatisms, though\nrarer, are, if possible, even more convincing than sensations. The\nsubjects here actually feel themselves played upon by powers beyond their\nwill. The evidence is dynamic; the God or spirit moves the very organs of\ntheir body.(322)\nThe great field for this sense of being the instrument of a higher power\nis of course \u201cinspiration.\u201d It is easy to discriminate between the\nreligious leaders who have been habitually subject to inspiration and\nthose who have not. In the teachings of the Buddha, of Jesus, of Saint\nPaul (apart from his gift of tongues), of Saint Augustine, of Huss, of\nLuther, of Wesley, automatic or semi\u2010automatic composition appears to have\nbeen only occasional. In the Hebrew prophets, on the contrary, in\nMohammed, in some of the Alexandrians, in many minor Catholic saints, in\nFox, in Joseph Smith, something like it appears to have been frequent,\nsometimes habitual. We have distinct professions of being under the\ndirection of a foreign power, and serving as its mouthpiece. As regards\nthe Hebrew prophets, it is extraordinary, writes an author who has made a\ncareful study of them, to see\u2014\n\u201cHow, one after another, the same features are reproduced in the\nprophetic books. The process is always extremely different from\nwhat it would be if the prophet arrived at his insight into\nspiritual things by the tentative efforts of his own genius. There\nis something sharp and sudden about it. He can lay his finger, so\nto speak, on the moment when it came. And it always comes in the\nform of an overpowering force from without, against which he\nstruggles, but in vain. Listen, for instance, [to] the opening of\nthe book of Jeremiah. Read through in like manner the first two\nchapters of the prophecy of Ezekiel.\n\u201cIt is not, however, only at the beginning of his career that the\nprophet passes through a crisis which is clearly not self\u2010caused.\nScattered all through the prophetic writings are expressions which\nspeak of some strong and irresistible impulse coming down upon the\nprophet, determining his attitude to the events of his time,\nconstraining his utterance, making his words the vehicle of a\nhigher meaning than their own. For instance, this of Isaiah\u2019s:\n\u2018The Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand,\u2019\u2014an emphatic phrase\nwhich denotes the overmastering nature of the impulse,\u2014\u2018and\ninstructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people.\u2019\n... Or passages like this from Ezekiel: \u2018The hand of the Lord God\nfell upon me,\u2019 \u2018The hand of the Lord was strong upon me.\u2019 The one\nstanding characteristic of the prophet is that he speaks with the\nauthority of Jehovah himself. Hence it is that the prophets one\nand all preface their addresses so confidently, \u2018The Word of the\nLord,\u2019 or \u2018Thus saith the Lord.\u2019 They have even the audacity to\nspeak in the first person, as if Jehovah himself were speaking. As\nin Isaiah: \u2018Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called; I am\nHe, I am the First, I also am the last,\u2019\u2014and so on. The\npersonality of the prophet sinks entirely into the background; he\nfeels himself for the time being the mouthpiece of the\nAlmighty.\u201d(323)\n\u201cWe need to remember that prophecy was a profession, and that the\nprophets formed a professional class. There were schools of the\nprophets, in which the gift was regularly cultivated. A group of\nyoung men would gather round some commanding figure\u2014a Samuel or an\nElisha\u2014and would not only record or spread the knowledge of his\nsayings and doings, but seek to catch themselves something of his\ninspiration. It seems that music played its part in their\nexercises.... It is perfectly clear that by no means all of these\nSons of the prophets ever succeeded in acquiring more than a very\nsmall share in the gift which they sought. It was clearly possible\nto \u2018counterfeit\u2019 prophecy. Sometimes this was done\ndeliberately.... But it by no means follows that in all cases\nwhere a false message was given, the giver of it was altogether\nconscious of what he was doing.\u201d(324)\nHere, to take another Jewish case, is the way in which Philo of Alexandria\ndescribes his inspiration:\u2014\n\u201cSometimes, when I have come to my work empty, I have suddenly\nbecome full; ideas being in an invisible manner showered upon me,\nand implanted in me from on high; so that through the influence of\ndivine inspiration, I have become greatly excited, and have known\nneither the place in which I was, nor those who were present, nor\nmyself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was writing; for then I\nhave been conscious of a richness of interpretation, an enjoyment\nof light, a most penetrating insight, a most manifest energy in\nall that was to be done; having such effect on my mind as the\nclearest ocular demonstration would have on the eyes.\u201d(325)\nIf we turn to Islam, we find that Mohammed\u2019s revelations all came from the\nsubconscious sphere. To the question in what way he got them,\u2014\n\u201cMohammed is said to have answered that sometimes he heard a knell\nas from a bell, and that this had the strongest effect on him; and\nwhen the angel went away, he had received the revelation.\nSometimes again he held converse with the angel as with a man, so\nas easily to understand his words. The later authorities, however,\n... distinguish still other kinds. In the Itg\u00e2n (103) the\nfollowing are enumerated: 1, revelations with sound of bell, 2, by\ninspiration of the holy spirit in M.\u2019s heart, 3, by Gabriel in\nhuman form, 4, by God immediately, either when awake (as in his\njourney to heaven) or in dream.... In Almaw\u00e2hib alladun\u00eeya the\nkinds are thus given: 1, Dream, 2, Inspiration of Gabriel in the\nProphet\u2019s heart, 3, Gabriel taking Dahya\u2019s form, 4, with the bell\u2010\nsound, etc., 5, Gabriel in propri\u00e2 person\u00e2 (only twice), 6,\nrevelation in heaven, 7, God appearing in person, but veiled, 8,\nGod revealing himself immediately without veil. Others add two\nother stages, namely: 1, Gabriel in the form of still another man,\n2, God showing himself personally in dream.\u201d(326)\nIn none of these cases is the revelation distinctly motor. In the case of\nJoseph Smith (who had prophetic revelations innumerable in addition to the\nrevealed translation of the gold plates which resulted in the Book of\nMormon), although there may have been a motor element, the inspiration\nseems to have been predominantly sensorial. He began his translation by\nthe aid of the \u201cpeep\u2010stones\u201d which he found, or thought or said that he\nfound, with the gold plates,\u2014apparently a case of \u201ccrystal gazing.\u201d For\nsome of the other revelations he used the peep\u2010stones, but seems generally\nto have asked the Lord for more direct instruction.(327)\nOther revelations are described as \u201copenings\u201d\u2014Fox\u2019s, for example, were\nevidently of the kind known in spiritistic circles of to\u2010day as\n\u201cimpressions.\u201d As all effective initiators of change must needs live to\nsome degree upon this psychopathic level of sudden perception or\nconviction of new truth, or of impulse to action so obsessive that it must\nbe worked off, I will say nothing more about so very common a phenomenon.\nWhen, in addition to these phenomena of inspiration, we take religious\nmysticism into the account, when we recall the striking and sudden\nunifications of a discordant self which we saw in conversion, and when we\nreview the extravagant obsessions of tenderness, purity, and self\u2010severity\nmet with in saintliness, we cannot, I think, avoid the conclusion that in\nreligion we have a department of human nature with unusually close\nrelations to the trans\u2010marginal or subliminal region. If the word\n\u201csubliminal\u201d is offensive to any of you, as smelling too much of psychical\nresearch or other aberrations, call it by any other name you please, to\ndistinguish it from the level of full sunlit consciousness. Call this\nlatter the A\u2010region of personality, if you care to, and call the other the\nB\u2010region. The B\u2010region, then, is obviously the larger part of each of us,\nfor it is the abode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of\neverything that passes unrecorded or unobserved. It contains, for example,\nsuch things as all our momentarily inactive memories, and it harbors the\nsprings of all our obscurely motived passions, impulses, likes, dislikes,\nand prejudices. Our intuitions, hypotheses, fancies, superstitions,\npersuasions, convictions, and in general all our non\u2010rational operations,\ncome from it. It is the source of our dreams, and apparently they may\nreturn to it. In it arise whatever mystical experiences we may have, and\nour automatisms, sensory or motor; our life in hypnotic and \u201chypnoid\u201d\nconditions, if we are subjects to such conditions; our delusions, fixed\nideas, and hysterical accidents, if we are hysteric subjects; our supra\u2010\nnormal cognitions, if such there be, and if we are telepathic subjects. It\nis also the fountain\u2010head of much that feeds our religion. In persons deep\nin the religious life, as we have now abundantly seen,\u2014and this is my\nconclusion,\u2014the door into this region seems unusually wide open; at any\nrate, experiences making their entrance through that door have had\nemphatic influence in shaping religious history.\nWith this conclusion I turn back and close the circle which I opened in my\nfirst lecture, terminating thus the review which I then announced of inner\nreligious phenomena as we find them in developed and articulate human\nindividuals. I might easily, if the time allowed, multiply both my\ndocuments and my discriminations, but a broad treatment is, I believe, in\nitself better, and the most important characteristics of the subject lie,\nI think, before us already. In the next lecture, which is also the last\none, we must try to draw the critical conclusions which so much material\nmay suggest.\nLECTURE XX. CONCLUSIONS.\nThe material of our study of human nature is now spread before us; and in\nthis parting hour, set free from the duty of description, we can draw our\ntheoretical and practical conclusions. In my first lecture, defending the\nempirical method, I foretold that whatever conclusions we might come to\ncould be reached by spiritual judgments only, appreciations of the\nsignificance for life of religion, taken \u201con the whole.\u201d Our conclusions\ncannot be as sharp as dogmatic conclusions would be, but I will formulate\nthem, when the time comes, as sharply as I can.\nSumming up in the broadest possible way the characteristics of the\nreligious life, as we have found them, it includes the following beliefs:\u2014\n1. That the visible world is part of a more spiritual universe from which\nit draws its chief significance;\n2. That union or harmonious relation with that higher universe is our true\nend;\n3. That prayer or inner communion with the spirit thereof\u2014be that spirit\n\u201cGod\u201d or \u201claw\u201d\u2014is a process wherein work is really done, and spiritual\nenergy flows in and produces effects, psychological or material, within\nthe phenomenal world.\nReligion includes also the following psychological characteristics:\u2014\n4. A new zest which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form\neither of lyrical enchantment or of appeal to earnestness and heroism.\n5. An assurance of safety and a temper of peace, and, in relation to\nothers, a preponderance of loving affections.\nIn illustrating these characteristics by documents, we have been literally\nbathed in sentiment. In re\u2010reading my manuscript, I am almost appalled at\nthe amount of emotionality which I find in it. After so much of this, we\ncan afford to be dryer and less sympathetic in the rest of the work that\nlies before us.\nThe sentimentality of many of my documents is a consequence of the fact\nthat I sought them among the extravagances of the subject. If any of you\nare enemies of what our ancestors used to brand as enthusiasm, and are,\nnevertheless, still listening to me now, you have probably felt my\nselection to have been sometimes almost perverse, and have wished I might\nhave stuck to soberer examples. I reply that I took these extremer\nexamples as yielding the profounder information. To learn the secrets of\nany science, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be\neccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils. We combine what they\ntell us with the rest of our wisdom, and form our final judgment\nindependently. Even so with religion. We who have pursued such radical\nexpressions of it may now be sure that we know its secrets as\nauthentically as any one can know them who learns them from another; and\nwe have next to answer, each of us for himself, the practical question:\nwhat are the dangers in this element of life? and in what proportion may\nit need to be restrained by other elements, to give the proper balance?\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut this question suggests another one which I will answer immediately and\nget it out of the way, for it has more than once already vexed us.(328)\nOught it to be assumed that in all men the mixture of religion with other\nelements should be identical? Ought it, indeed, to be assumed that the\nlives of all men should show identical religious elements? In other words,\nis the existence of so many religious types and sects and creeds\nregrettable?\nTo these questions I answer \u201cNo\u201d emphatically. And my reason is that I do\nnot see how it is possible that creatures in such different positions and\nwith such different powers as human individuals are, should have exactly\nthe same functions and the same duties. No two of us have identical\ndifficulties, nor should we be expected to work out identical solutions.\nEach, from his peculiar angle of observation, takes in a certain sphere of\nfact and trouble, which each must deal with in a unique manner. One of us\nmust soften himself, another must harden himself; one must yield a point,\nanother must stand firm,\u2014in order the better to defend the position\nassigned him. If an Emerson were forced to be a Wesley, or a Moody forced\nto be a Whitman, the total human consciousness of the divine would suffer.\nThe divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities,\nby being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find\nworthy missions. Each attitude being a syllable in human nature\u2019s total\nmessage, it takes the whole of us to spell the meaning out completely. So\na \u201cgod of battles\u201d must be allowed to be the god for one kind of person, a\ngod of peace and heaven and home, the god for another. We must frankly\nrecognize the fact that we live in partial systems, and that parts are not\ninterchangeable in the spiritual life. If we are peevish and jealous,\ndestruction of the self must be an element of our religion; why need it be\none if we are good and sympathetic from the outset? If we are sick souls,\nwe require a religion of deliverance; but why think so much of\ndeliverance, if we are healthy\u2010minded?(329) Unquestionably, some men have\nthe completer experience and the higher vocation, here just as in the\nsocial world; but for each man to stay in his own experience, whate\u2019er it\nbe, and for others to tolerate him there, is surely best.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nBut, you may now ask, would not this one\u2010sidedness be cured if we should\nall espouse the science of religions as our own religion? In answering\nthis question I must open again the general relations of the theoretic to\nthe active life.\nKnowledge about a thing is not the thing itself. You remember what Al\u2010\nGhazzali told us in the Lecture on Mysticism,\u2014that to understand the\ncauses of drunkenness, as a physician understands them, is not to be\ndrunk. A science might come to understand everything about the causes and\nelements of religion, and might even decide which elements were qualified,\nby their general harmony with other branches of knowledge, to be\nconsidered true; and yet the best man at this science might be the man who\nfound it hardest to be personally devout. _Tout savoir c\u2019est tout\npardonner._ The name of Renan would doubtless occur to many persons as an\nexample of the way in which breadth of knowledge may make one only a\ndilettante in possibilities, and blunt the acuteness of one\u2019s living\nfaith.(330) If religion be a function by which either God\u2019s cause or man\u2019s\ncause is to be really advanced, then he who lives the life of it, however\nnarrowly, is a better servant than he who merely knows about it, however\nmuch. Knowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation of a place\nin life, with its dynamic currents passing through your being, is another.\nFor this reason, the science of religions may not be an equivalent for\nliving religion; and if we turn to the inner difficulties of such a\nscience, we see that a point comes when she must drop the purely theoretic\nattitude, and either let her knots remain uncut, or have them cut by\nactive faith. To see this, suppose that we have our science of religions\nconstituted as a matter of fact. Suppose that she has assimilated all the\nnecessary historical material and distilled out of it as its essence the\nsame conclusions which I myself a few moments ago pronounced. Suppose that\nshe agrees that religion, wherever it is an active thing, involves a\nbelief in ideal presences, and a belief that in our prayerful communion\nwith them,(331) work is done, and something real comes to pass. She has\nnow to exert her critical activity, and to decide how far, in the light of\nother sciences and in that of general philosophy, such beliefs can be\nconsidered _true_.\nDogmatically to decide this is an impossible task. Not only are the other\nsciences and the philosophy still far from being completed, but in their\npresent state we find them full of conflicts. The sciences of nature know\nnothing of spiritual presences, and on the whole hold no practical\ncommerce whatever with the idealistic conceptions towards which general\nphilosophy inclines. The scientist, so\u2010called, is, during his scientific\nhours at least, so materialistic that one may well say that on the whole\nthe influence of science goes against the notion that religion should be\nrecognized at all. And this antipathy to religion finds an echo within the\nvery science of religions itself. The cultivator of this science has to\nbecome acquainted with so many groveling and horrible superstitions that a\npresumption easily arises in his mind that any belief that is religious\nprobably is false. In the \u201cprayerful communion\u201d of savages with such\nmumbo\u2010jumbos of deities as they acknowledge, it is hard for us to see what\ngenuine spiritual work\u2014even though it were work relative only to their\ndark savage obligations\u2014can possibly be done.\nThe consequence is that the conclusions of the science of religions are as\nlikely to be adverse as they are to be favorable to the claim that the\nessence of religion is true. There is a notion in the air about us that\nreligion is probably only an anachronism, a case of \u201csurvival,\u201d an\natavistic relapse into a mode of thought which humanity in its more\nenlightened examples has outgrown; and this notion our religious\nanthropologists at present do little to counteract.\nThis view is so widespread at the present day that I must consider it with\nsome explicitness before I pass to my own conclusions. Let me call it the\n\u201cSurvival theory,\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake.\nThe pivot round which the religious life, as we have traced it, revolves,\nis the interest of the individual in his private personal destiny.\nReligion, in short, is a monumental chapter in the history of human\negotism. The gods believed in\u2014whether by crude savages or by men\ndisciplined intellectually\u2014agree with each other in recognizing personal\ncalls. Religious thought is carried on in terms of personality, this\nbeing, in the world of religion, the one fundamental fact. To\u2010day, quite\nas much as at any previous age, the religious individual tells you that\nthe divine meets him on the basis of his personal concerns.\nScience, on the other hand, has ended by utterly repudiating the personal\npoint of view. She catalogues her elements and records her laws\nindifferent as to what purpose may be shown forth by them, and constructs\nher theories quite careless of their bearing on human anxieties and fates.\nThough the scientist may individually nourish a religion, and be a theist\nin his irresponsible hours, the days are over when it could be said that\nfor Science herself the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament\nshoweth his handiwork. Our solar system, with its harmonies, is seen now\nas but one passing case of a certain sort of moving equilibrium in the\nheavens, realized by a local accident in an appalling wilderness of worlds\nwhere no life can exist. In a span of time which as a cosmic interval will\ncount but as an hour, it will have ceased to be. The Darwinian notion of\nchance production, and subsequent destruction, speedy or deferred, applies\nto the largest as well as to the smallest facts. It is impossible, in the\npresent temper of the scientific imagination, to find in the driftings of\nthe cosmic atoms, whether they work on the universal or on the particular\nscale, anything but a kind of aimless weather, doing and undoing,\nachieving no proper history, and leaving no result. Nature has no one\ndistinguishable ultimate tendency with which it is possible to feel a\nsympathy. In the vast rhythm of her processes, as the scientific mind now\nfollows them, she appears to cancel herself. The books of natural theology\nwhich satisfied the intellects of our grandfathers seem to us quite\ngrotesque,(332) representing, as they did, a God who conformed the largest\nthings of nature to the paltriest of our private wants. The God whom\nscience recognizes must be a God of universal laws exclusively, a God who\ndoes a wholesale, not a retail business. He cannot accommodate his\nprocesses to the convenience of individuals. The bubbles on the foam which\ncoats a stormy sea are floating episodes, made and unmade by the forces of\nthe wind and water. Our private selves are like those\nbubbles,\u2014epiphenomena, as Clifford, I believe, ingeniously called them;\ntheir destinies weigh nothing and determine nothing in the world\u2019s\nirremediable currents of events.\nYou see how natural it is, from this point of view, to treat religion as a\nmere survival, for religion does in fact perpetuate the traditions of the\nmost primeval thought. To coerce the spiritual powers, or to square them\nand get them on our side, was, during enormous tracts of time, the one\ngreat object in our dealings with the natural world. For our ancestors,\ndreams, hallucinations, revelations, and cock\u2010and\u2010bull stories were\ninextricably mixed with facts. Up to a comparatively recent date such\ndistinctions as those between what has been verified and what is only\nconjectured, between the impersonal and the personal aspects of existence,\nwere hardly suspected or conceived. Whatever you imagined in a lively\nmanner, whatever you thought fit to be true, you affirmed confidently; and\nwhatever you affirmed, your comrades believed. Truth was what had not yet\nbeen contradicted, most things were taken into the mind from the point of\nview of their human suggestiveness, and the attention confined itself\nexclusively to the \u00e6sthetic and dramatic aspects of events.(333)\nHow indeed could it be otherwise? The extraordinary value, for explanation\nand prevision, of those mathematical and mechanical modes of conception\nwhich science uses, was a result that could not possibly have been\nexpected in advance. Weight, movement, velocity, direction, position, what\nthin, pallid, uninteresting ideas! How could the richer animistic aspects\nof Nature, the peculiarities and oddities that make phenomena\npicturesquely striking or expressive, fail to have been first singled out\nand followed by philosophy as the more promising avenue to the knowledge\nof Nature\u2019s life? Well, it is still in these richer animistic and dramatic\naspects that religion delights to dwell. It is the terror and beauty of\nphenomena, the \u201cpromise\u201d of the dawn and of the rainbow, the \u201cvoice\u201d of\nthe thunder, the \u201cgentleness\u201d of the summer rain, the \u201csublimity\u201d of the\nstars, and not the physical laws which these things follow, by which the\nreligious mind still continues to be most impressed; and just as of yore,\nthe devout man tells you that in the solitude of his room or of the fields\nhe still feels the divine presence, that inflowings of help come in reply\nto his prayers, and that sacrifices to this unseen reality fill him with\nsecurity and peace.\nPure anachronism! says the survival\u2010theory;\u2014anachronism for which\ndeanthropomorphization of the imagination is the remedy required. The less\nwe mix the private with the cosmic, the more we dwell in universal and\nimpersonal terms, the truer heirs of Science we become.\nIn spite of the appeal which this impersonality of the scientific attitude\nmakes to a certain magnanimity of temper, I believe it to be shallow, and\nI can now state my reason in comparatively few words. That reason is that,\nso long as we deal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only with the\nsymbols of reality, but _as soon as we deal with private and personal\nphenomena as such, we deal with realities in the completest sense of the\nterm_. I think I can easily make clear what I mean by these words.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe world of our experience consists at all times of two parts, an\nobjective and a subjective part, of which the former may be incalculably\nmore extensive than the latter, and yet the latter can never be omitted or\nsuppressed. The objective part is the sum total of whatsoever at any given\ntime we may be thinking of, the subjective part is the inner \u201cstate\u201d in\nwhich the thinking comes to pass. What we think of may be enormous,\u2014the\ncosmic times and spaces, for example,\u2014whereas the inner state may be the\nmost fugitive and paltry activity of mind. Yet the cosmic objects, so far\nas the experience yields them, are but ideal pictures of something whose\nexistence we do not inwardly possess but only point at outwardly, while\nthe inner state is our very experience itself; its reality and that of our\nexperience are one. A conscious field _plus_ its object as felt or thought\nof _plus_ an attitude towards the object _plus_ the sense of a self to\nwhom the attitude belongs\u2014such a concrete bit of personal experience may\nbe a small bit, but it is a solid bit as long as it lasts; not hollow, not\na mere abstract element of experience, such as the \u201cobject\u201d is when taken\nall alone. It is a _full_ fact, even though it be an insignificant fact;\nit is of the _kind_ to which all realities whatsoever must belong; the\nmotor currents of the world run through the like of it; it is on the line\nconnecting real events with real events. That unsharable feeling which\neach one of us has of the pinch of his individual destiny as he privately\nfeels it rolling out on fortune\u2019s wheel may be disparaged for its egotism,\nmay be sneered at as unscientific, but it is the one thing that fills up\nthe measure of our concrete actuality, and any would\u2010be existent that\nshould lack such a feeling, or its analogue, would be a piece of reality\nonly half made up.(334)\nIf this be true, it is absurd for science to say that the egotistic\nelements of experience should be suppressed. The axis of reality runs\nsolely through the egotistic places,\u2014they are strung upon it like so many\nbeads. To describe the world with all the various feelings of the\nindividual pinch of destiny, all the various spiritual attitudes, left out\nfrom the description\u2014they being as describable as anything else\u2014would be\nsomething like offering a printed bill of fare as the equivalent for a\nsolid meal. Religion makes no such blunder. The individual\u2019s religion may\nbe egotistic, and those private realities which it keeps in touch with may\nbe narrow enough; but at any rate it always remains infinitely less hollow\nand abstract, as far as it goes, than a science which prides itself on\ntaking no account of anything private at all.\nA bill of fare with one real raisin on it instead of the word \u201craisin,\u201d\nwith one real egg instead of the word \u201cegg,\u201d might be an inadequate meal,\nbut it would at least be a commencement of reality. The contention of the\nsurvival\u2010theory that we ought to stick to non\u2010personal elements\nexclusively seems like saying that we ought to be satisfied forever with\nreading the naked bill of fare. I think, therefore, that however\nparticular questions connected with our individual destinies may be\nanswered, it is only by acknowledging them as genuine questions, and\nliving in the sphere of thought which they open up, that we become\nprofound. But to live thus is to be religious; so I unhesitatingly\nrepudiate the survival\u2010theory of religion, as being founded on an\negregious mistake. It does not follow, because our ancestors made so many\nerrors of fact and mixed them with their religion, that we should\ntherefore leave off being religious at all.(335) By being religious we\nestablish ourselves in possession of ultimate reality at the only points\nat which reality is given us to guard. Our responsible concern is with our\nprivate destiny, after all.\nYou see now why I have been so individualistic throughout these lectures,\nand why I have seemed so bent on rehabilitating the element of feeling in\nreligion and subordinating its intellectual part. Individuality is founded\nin feeling; and the recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder strata of\ncharacter, are the only places in the world in which we catch real fact in\nthe making, and directly perceive how events happen, and how work is\nactually done.(336) Compared with this world of living individualized\nfeelings, the world of generalized objects which the intellect\ncontemplates is without solidity or life. As in stereoscopic or\nkinetoscopic pictures seen outside the instrument, the third dimension,\nthe movement, the vital element, are not there. We get a beautiful picture\nof an express train supposed to be moving, but where in the picture, as I\nhave heard a friend say, is the energy or the fifty miles an hour?(337)\nLet us agree, then, that Religion, occupying herself with personal\ndestinies and keeping thus in contact with the only absolute realities\nwhich we know, must necessarily play an eternal part in human history. The\nnext thing to decide is what she reveals about those destinies, or whether\nindeed she reveals anything distinct enough to be considered a general\nmessage to mankind. We have done as you see, with our preliminaries, and\nour final summing up can now begin.\nI am well aware that after all the palpitating documents which I have\nquoted, and all the perspectives of emotion\u2010inspiring institution and\nbelief that my previous lectures have opened, the dry analysis to which I\nnow advance may appear to many of you like an anti\u2010climax, a tapering\u2010off\nand flattening out of the subject, instead of a crescendo of interest and\nresult. I said awhile ago that the religious attitude of Protestants\nappears poverty\u2010stricken to the Catholic imagination. Still more poverty\u2010\nstricken, I fear, may my final summing up of the subject appear at first\nto some of you. On which account I pray you now to bear this point in\nmind, that in the present part of it I am expressly trying to reduce\nreligion to its lowest admissible terms, to that minimum, free from\nindividualistic excrescences, which all religions contain as their\nnucleus, and on which it may be hoped that all religious persons may\nagree. That established, we should have a result which might be small, but\nwould at least be solid; and on it and round it the ruddier additional\nbeliefs on which the different individuals make their venture might be\ngrafted, and flourish as richly as you please. I shall add my own over\u2010\nbelief (which will be, I confess, of a somewhat pallid kind, as befits a\ncritical philosopher), and you will, I hope, also add your over\u2010beliefs,\nand we shall soon be in the varied world of concrete religious\nconstructions once more. For the moment, let me dryly pursue the analytic\npart of the task.\nBoth thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct\nmay be determined either by feeling or by thought. When we survey the\nwhole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have\nprevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the\nother are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian, and Buddhist\nsaints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The theories\nwhich Religion generates, being thus variable, are secondary; and if you\nwish to grasp her essence, you must look to the feelings and the conduct\nas being the more constant elements. It is between these two elements that\nthe short circuit exists on which she carries on her principal business,\nwhile the ideas and symbols and other institutions form loop\u2010lines which\nmay be perfections and improvements, and may even some day all be united\ninto one harmonious system, but which are not to be regarded as organs\nwith an indispensable function, necessary at all times for religious life\nto go on. This seems to me the first conclusion which we are entitled to\ndraw from the phenomena we have passed in review.\nThe next step is to characterize the feelings. To what psychological order\ndo they belong?\nThe resultant outcome of them is in any case what Kant calls a \u201csthenic\u201d\naffection, an excitement of the cheerful, expansive, \u201cdynamogenic\u201d order\nwhich, like any tonic, freshens our vital powers. In almost every lecture,\nbut especially in the lectures on Conversion and on Saintliness, we have\nseen how this emotion overcomes temperamental melancholy and imparts\nendurance to the Subject, or a zest, or a meaning, or an enchantment and\nglory to the common objects of life.(338) The name of \u201cfaith\u2010state,\u201d by\nwhich Professor Leuba designates it, is a good one.(339) It is a\nbiological as well as a psychological condition, and Tolstoy is absolutely\naccurate in classing faith among the forces _by which men live_.(340) The\ntotal absence of it, anhedonia,(341) means collapse.\nThe faith\u2010state may hold a very minimum of intellectual content. We saw\nexamples of this in those sudden raptures of the divine presence, or in\nsuch mystical seizures as Dr. Bucke described.(342) It may be a mere vague\nenthusiasm, half spiritual, half vital, a courage, and a feeling that\ngreat and wondrous things are in the air.(343)\nWhen, however, a positive intellectual content is associated with a faith\u2010\nstate, it gets invincibly stamped in upon belief,(344) and this explains\nthe passionate loyalty of religious persons everywhere to the minutest\ndetails of their so widely differing creeds. Taking creeds and faith\u2010state\ntogether, as forming \u201creligions,\u201d and treating these as purely subjective\nphenomena, without regard to the question of their \u201ctruth,\u201d we are\nobliged, on account of their extraordinary influence upon action and\nendurance, to class them amongst the most important biological functions\nof mankind. Their stimulant and an\u00e6sthetic effect is so great that\nProfessor Leuba, in a recent article,(345) goes so far as to say that so\nlong as men can _use_ their God, they care very little who he is, or even\nwhether he is at all. \u201cThe truth of the matter can be put,\u201d says Leuba,\n\u201cin this way: _God is not known, he is not understood; he is\nused_\u2014sometimes as meat\u2010purveyor, sometimes as moral support, sometimes as\nfriend, sometimes as an object of love. If he proves himself useful, the\nreligious consciousness asks for no more than that. Does God really exist?\nHow does he exist? What is he? are so many irrelevant questions. Not God,\nbut life, more life, a larger, richer, more satisfying life, is, in the\nlast analysis, the end of religion. The love of life, at any and every\nlevel of development, is the religious impulse.\u201d(346)\nAt this purely subjective rating, therefore, Religion must be considered\nvindicated in a certain way from the attacks of her critics. It would seem\nthat she cannot be a mere anachronism and survival, but must exert a\npermanent function, whether she be with or without intellectual content,\nand whether, if she have any, it be true or false.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nWe must next pass beyond the point of view of merely subjective utility,\nand make inquiry into the intellectual content itself.\nFirst, is there, under all the discrepancies of the creeds, a common\nnucleus to which they bear their testimony unanimously?\nAnd second, ought we to consider the testimony true?\nI will take up the first question first, and answer it immediately in the\naffirmative. The warring gods and formulas of the various religions do\nindeed cancel each other, but there is a certain uniform deliverance in\nwhich religions all appear to meet. It consists of two parts:\u2014\n1. An uneasiness; and\n2. Its solution.\n1. The uneasiness, reduced to its simplest terms, is a sense that there is\n_something wrong about us_ as we naturally stand.\n2. The solution is a sense that _we are saved from the wrongness_ by\nmaking proper connection with the higher powers.\nIn those more developed minds which alone we are studying, the wrongness\ntakes a moral character, and the salvation takes a mystical tinge. I think\nwe shall keep well within the limits of what is common to all such minds\nif we formulate the essence of their religious experience in terms like\nthese:\u2014\nThe individual, so far as he suffers from his wrongness and criticises it,\nis to that extent consciously beyond it, and in at least possible touch\nwith something higher, if anything higher exist. Along with the wrong part\nthere is thus a better part of him, even though it may be but a most\nhelpless germ. With which part he should identify his real being is by no\nmeans obvious at this stage; but when stage 2 (the stage of solution or\nsalvation) arrives,(347) the man identifies his real being with the\ngerminal higher part of himself; and does so in the following way. _He\nbecomes conscious that this higher part is conterminous and continuous\nwith a _MORE_ of the same quality, which is operative in the universe\noutside of him, and which he can keep in working touch with, and in a\nfashion get on board of and save himself when all his lower being has gone\nto pieces in the wreck._\nIt seems to me that all the phenomena are accurately describable in these\nvery simple general terms.(348) They allow for the divided self and the\nstruggle; they involve the change of personal centre and the surrender of\nthe lower self; they express the appearance of exteriority of the helping\npower and yet account for our sense of union with it;(349) and they fully\njustify our feelings of security and joy. There is probably no\nautobiographic document, among all those which I have quoted, to which the\ndescription will not well apply. One need only add such specific details\nas will adapt it to various theologies and various personal temperaments,\nand one will then have the various experiences reconstructed in their\nindividual forms.\nSo far, however, as this analysis goes, the experiences are only\npsychological phenomena. They possess, it is true, enormous biological\nworth. Spiritual strength really increases in the subject when he has\nthem, a new life opens for him, and they seem to him a place of conflux\nwhere the forces of two universes meet; and yet this may be nothing but\nhis subjective way of feeling things, a mood of his own fancy, in spite of\nthe effects produced. I now turn to my second question: What is the\nobjective \u201ctruth\u201d of their content?(350)\nThe part of the content concerning which the question of truth most\npertinently arises is that \u201cMORE of the same quality\u201d with which our own\nhigher self appears in the experience to come into harmonious working\nrelation. Is such a \u201cmore\u201d merely our own notion, or does it really exist?\nIf so, in what shape does it exist? Does it act, as well as exist? And in\nwhat form should we conceive of that \u201cunion\u201d with it of which religious\ngeniuses are so convinced?\nIt is in answering these questions that the various theologies perform\ntheir theoretic work, and that their divergencies most come to light. They\nall agree that the \u201cmore\u201d really exists; though some of them hold it to\nexist in the shape of a personal god or gods, while others are satisfied\nto conceive it as a stream of ideal tendency embedded in the eternal\nstructure of the world. They all agree, moreover, that it acts as well as\nexists, and that something really is effected for the better when you\nthrow your life into its hands. It is when they treat of the experience of\n\u201cunion\u201d with it that their speculative differences appear most clearly.\nOver this point pantheism and theism, nature and second birth, works and\ngrace and karma, immortality and reincarnation, rationalism and mysticism,\ncarry on inveterate disputes.\nAt the end of my lecture on Philosophy(351) I held out the notion that an\nimpartial science of religions might sift out from the midst of their\ndiscrepancies a common body of doctrine which she might also formulate in\nterms to which physical science need not object. This, I said, she might\nadopt as her own reconciling hypothesis, and recommend it for general\nbelief. I also said that in my last lecture I should have to try my own\nhand at framing such an hypothesis.\nThe time has now come for this attempt. Who says \u201chypothesis\u201d renounces\nthe ambition to be coercive in his arguments. The most I can do is,\naccordingly, to offer something that may fit the facts so easily that your\nscientific logic will find no plausible pretext for vetoing your impulse\nto welcome it as true.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe \u201cmore,\u201d as we called it, and the meaning of our \u201cunion\u201d with it, form\nthe nucleus of our inquiry. Into what definite description can these words\nbe translated, and for what definite facts do they stand? It would never\ndo for us to place ourselves offhand at the position of a particular\ntheology, the Christian theology, for example, and proceed immediately to\ndefine the \u201cmore\u201d as Jehovah, and the \u201cunion\u201d as his imputation to us of\nthe righteousness of Christ. That would be unfair to other religions, and,\nfrom our present standpoint at least, would be an over\u2010belief.\nWe must begin by using less particularized terms; and, since one of the\nduties of the science of religions is to keep religion in connection with\nthe rest of science, we shall do well to seek first of all a way of\ndescribing the \u201cmore,\u201d which psychologists may also recognize as real. The\n_subconscious self_ is nowadays a well\u2010accredited psychological entity;\nand I believe that in it we have exactly the mediating term required.\nApart from all religious considerations, there is actually and literally\nmore life in our total soul than we are at any time aware of. The\nexploration of the transmarginal field has hardly yet been seriously\nundertaken, but what Mr. Myers said in 1892 in his essay on the Subliminal\nConsciousness(352) is as true as when it was first written: \u201cEach of us is\nin reality an abiding psychical entity far more extensive than he knows\u2014an\nindividuality which can never express itself completely through any\ncorporeal manifestation. The Self manifests through the organism; but\nthere is always some part of the Self unmanifested; and always, as it\nseems, some power of organic expression in abeyance or reserve.\u201d(353) Much\nof the content of this larger background against which our conscious being\nstands out in relief is insignificant. Imperfect memories, silly jingles,\ninhibitive timidities, \u201cdissolutive\u201d phenomena of various sorts, as Myers\ncalls them, enter into it for a large part. But in it many of the\nperformances of genius seem also to have their origin; and in our study of\nconversion, of mystical experiences, and of prayer, we have seen how\nstriking a part invasions from this region play in the religious life.\nLet me then propose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it may be on its\n_farther_ side, the \u201cmore\u201d with which in religious experience we feel\nourselves connected is on its _hither_ side the subconscious continuation\nof our conscious life. Starting thus with a recognized psychological fact\nas our basis, we seem to preserve a contact with \u201cscience\u201d which the\nordinary theologian lacks. At the same time the theologian\u2019s contention\nthat the religious man is moved by an external power is vindicated, for it\nis one of the peculiarities of invasions from the subconscious region to\ntake on objective appearances, and to suggest to the Subject an external\ncontrol. In the religious life the control is felt as \u201chigher\u201d; but since\non our hypothesis it is primarily the higher faculties of our own hidden\nmind which are controlling, the sense of union with the power beyond us is\na sense of something, not merely apparently, but literally true.\nThis doorway into the subject seems to me the best one for a science of\nreligions, for it mediates between a number of different points of view.\nYet it is only a doorway, and difficulties present themselves as soon as\nwe step through it, and ask how far our transmarginal consciousness\ncarries us if we follow it on its remoter side. Here the over\u2010beliefs\nbegin: here mysticism and the conversion\u2010rapture and Vedantism and\ntranscendental idealism bring in their monistic interpretations(354) and\ntell us that the finite self rejoins the absolute self, for it was always\none with God and identical with the soul of the world.(355) Here the\nprophets of all the different religions come with their visions, voices,\nraptures, and other openings, supposed by each to authenticate his own\npeculiar faith.\nThose of us who are not personally favored with such specific revelations\nmust stand outside of them altogether and, for the present at least,\ndecide that, since they corroborate incompatible theological doctrines,\nthey neutralize one another and leave no fixed result. If we follow any\none of them, or if we follow philosophical theory and embrace monistic\npantheism on non\u2010mystical grounds, we do so in the exercise of our\nindividual freedom, and build out our religion in the way most congruous\nwith our personal susceptibilities. Among these susceptibilities\nintellectual ones play a decisive part. Although the religious question is\nprimarily a question of life, of living or not living in the higher union\nwhich opens itself to us as a gift, yet the spiritual excitement in which\nthe gift appears a real one will often fail to be aroused in an individual\nuntil certain particular intellectual beliefs or ideas which, as we say,\ncome home to him, are touched.(356) These ideas will thus be essential to\nthat individual\u2019s religion;\u2014which is as much as to say that over\u2010beliefs\nin various directions are absolutely indispensable, and that we should\ntreat them with tenderness and tolerance so long as they are not\nintolerant themselves. As I have elsewhere written, the most interesting\nand valuable things about a man are usually his over\u2010beliefs.\nDisregarding the over\u2010beliefs, and confining ourselves to what is common\nand generic, we have in _the fact that the conscious person is continuous\nwith a wider self through which saving experiences come_,(357) a positive\ncontent of religious experience which, it seems to me, _is literally and\nobjectively true as far as it goes_. If I now proceed to state my own\nhypothesis about the farther limits of this extension of our personality,\nI shall be offering my own over\u2010belief\u2014though I know it will appear a\nsorry under\u2010belief to some of you\u2014for which I can only bespeak the same\nindulgence which in a converse case I should accord to yours.\n\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\nThe further limits of our being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether\nother dimension of existence from the sensible and merely \u201cunderstandable\u201d\nworld. Name it the mystical region, or the supernatural region, whichever\nyou choose. So far as our ideal impulses originate in this region (and\nmost of them do originate in it, for we find them possessing us in a way\nfor which we cannot articulately account), we belong to it in a more\nintimate sense than that in which we belong to the visible world, for we\nbelong in the most intimate sense wherever our ideals belong. Yet the\nunseen region in question is not merely ideal, for it produces effects in\nthis world. When we commune with it, work is actually done upon our finite\npersonality, for we are turned into new men, and consequences in the way\nof conduct follow in the natural world upon our regenerative change.(358)\nBut that which produces effects within another reality must be termed a\nreality itself, so I feel as if we had no philosophic excuse for calling\nthe unseen or mystical world unreal.\nGod is the natural appellation, for us Christians at least, for the\nsupreme reality, so I will call this higher part of the universe by the\nname of God.(359) We and God have business with each other; and in opening\nourselves to his influence our deepest destiny is fulfilled. The universe,\nat those parts of it which our personal being constitutes, takes a turn\ngenuinely for the worse or for the better in proportion as each one of us\nfulfills or evades God\u2019s demands. As far as this goes I probably have you\nwith me, for I only translate into schematic language what I may call the\ninstinctive belief of mankind: God is real since he produces real effects.\nThe real effects in question, so far as I have as yet admitted them, are\nexerted on the personal centres of energy of the various subjects, but the\nspontaneous faith of most of the subjects is that they embrace a wider\nsphere than this. Most religious men believe (or \u201cknow,\u201d if they be\nmystical) that not only they themselves, but the whole universe of beings\nto whom the God is present, are secure in his parental hands. There is a\nsense, a dimension, they are sure, in which we are _all_ saved, in spite\nof the gates of hell and all adverse terrestrial appearances. God\u2019s\nexistence is the guarantee of an ideal order that shall be permanently\npreserved. This world may indeed, as science assures us, some day burn up\nor freeze; but if it is part of his order, the old ideals are sure to be\nbrought elsewhere to fruition, so that where God is, tragedy is only\nprovisional and partial, and shipwreck and dissolution are not the\nabsolutely final things. Only when this farther step of faith concerning\nGod is taken, and remote objective consequences are predicted, does\nreligion, as it seems to me, get wholly free from the first immediate\nsubjective experience, and bring a _real hypothesis_ into play. A good\nhypothesis in science must have other properties than those of the\nphenomenon it is immediately invoked to explain, otherwise it is not\nprolific enough. God, meaning only what enters into the religious man\u2019s\nexperience of union, falls short of being an hypothesis of this more\nuseful order. He needs to enter into wider cosmic relations in order to\njustify the subject\u2019s absolute confidence and peace.\nThat the God with whom, starting from the hither side of our own extra\u2010\nmarginal self, we come at its remoter margin into commerce should be the\nabsolute world\u2010ruler, is of course a very considerable over\u2010belief. Over\u2010\nbelief as it is, though, it is an article of almost every one\u2019s religion.\nMost of us pretend in some way to prop it upon our philosophy, but the\nphilosophy itself is really propped upon this faith. What is this but to\nsay that Religion, in her fullest exercise of function, is not a mere\nillumination of facts already elsewhere given, not a mere passion, like\nlove, which views things in a rosier light. It is indeed that, as we have\nseen abundantly. But it is something more, namely, a postulator of new\n_facts_ as well. The world interpreted religiously is not the\nmaterialistic world over again, with an altered expression; it must have,\nover and above the altered expression, _a natural constitution_ different\nat some point from that which a materialistic world would have. It must be\nsuch that different events can be expected in it, different conduct must\nbe required.\nThis thoroughly \u201cpragmatic\u201d view of religion has usually been taken as a\nmatter of course by common men. They have interpolated divine miracles\ninto the field of nature, they have built a heaven out beyond the grave.\nIt is only transcendentalist metaphysicians who think that, without adding\nany concrete details to Nature, or subtracting any, but by simply calling\nit the expression of absolute spirit, you make it more divine just as it\nstands.\nI believe the pragmatic way of taking religion to be the deeper way. It\ngives it body as well as soul, it makes it claim, as everything real must\nclaim, some characteristic realm of fact as its very own. What the more\ncharacteristically divine facts are, apart from the actual inflow of\nenergy in the faith\u2010state and the prayer\u2010state, I know not. But the over\u2010\nbelief on which I am ready to make my personal venture is that they exist.\nThe whole drift of my education goes to persuade me that the world of our\npresent consciousness is only one out of many worlds of consciousness that\nexist, and that those other worlds must contain experiences which have a\nmeaning for our life also; and that although in the main their experiences\nand those of this world keep discrete, yet the two become continuous at\ncertain points, and higher energies filter in. By being faithful in my\npoor measure to this over\u2010belief, I seem to myself to keep more sane and\ntrue. I _can_, of course, put myself into the sectarian scientist\u2019s\nattitude, and imagine vividly that the world of sensations and of\nscientific laws and objects may be all. But whenever I do this, I hear\nthat inward monitor of which W. K. Clifford once wrote, whispering the\nword \u201cbosh!\u201d Humbug is humbug, even though it bear the scientific name,\nand the total expression of human experience, as I view it objectively,\ninvincibly urges me beyond the narrow \u201cscientific\u201d bounds. Assuredly, the\nreal world is of a different temperament,\u2014more intricately built than\nphysical science allows. So my objective and my subjective conscience both\nhold me to the over\u2010belief which I express. Who knows whether the\nfaithfulness of individuals here below to their own poor over\u2010beliefs may\nnot actually help God in turn to be more effectively faithful to his own\ngreater tasks?\nPOSTSCRIPT.\nIn writing my concluding lecture I had to aim so much at simplification\nthat I fear that my general philosophic position received so scant a\nstatement as hardly to be intelligible to some of my readers. I therefore\nadd this epilogue, which must also be so brief as possibly to remedy but\nlittle the defect. In a later work I may be enabled to state my position\nmore amply and consequently more clearly.\nOriginality cannot be expected in a field like this, where all the\nattitudes and tempers that are possible have been exhibited in literature\nlong ago, and where any new writer can immediately be classed under a\nfamiliar head. If one should make a division of all thinkers into\nnaturalists and supernaturalists, I should undoubtedly have to go, along\nwith most philosophers, into the supernaturalist branch. But there is a\ncrasser and a more refined supernaturalism, and it is to the refined\ndivision that most philosophers at the present day belong. If not regular\ntranscendental idealists, they at least obey the Kantian direction enough\nto bar out ideal entities from interfering causally in the course of\nphenomenal events. Refined supernaturalism is universalistic\nsupernaturalism; for the \u201ccrasser\u201d variety \u201cpiecemeal\u201d supernaturalism\nwould perhaps be the better name. It went with that older theology which\nto\u2010day is supposed to reign only among uneducated people, or to be found\namong the few belated professors of the dualisms which Kant is thought to\nhave displaced. It admits miracles and providential leadings, and finds no\nintellectual difficulty in mixing the ideal and the real worlds together\nby interpolating influences from the ideal region among the forces that\ncausally determine the real world\u2019s details. In this the refined\nsupernaturalists think that it muddles disparate dimensions of existence.\nFor them the world of the ideal has no efficient causality, and never\nbursts into the world of phenomena at particular points. The ideal world,\nfor them, is not a world of facts, but only of the meaning of facts; it is\na point of view for judging facts. It appertains to a different \u201c\u2010ology,\u201d\nand inhabits a different dimension of being altogether from that in which\nexistential propositions obtain. It cannot get down upon the flat level of\nexperience and interpolate itself piecemeal between distinct portions of\nnature, as those who believe, for example, in divine aid coming in\nresponse to prayer, are bound to think it must.\nNotwithstanding my own inability to accept either popular Christianity or\nscholastic theism, I suppose that my belief that in communion with the\nIdeal new force comes into the world, and new departures are made here\nbelow, subjects me to being classed among the supernaturalists of the\npiecemeal or crasser type. Universalistic supernaturalism surrenders, it\nseems to me, too easily to naturalism. It takes the facts of physical\nscience at their face\u2010value, and leaves the laws of life just as\nnaturalism finds them, with no hope of remedy, in case their fruits are\nbad. It confines itself to sentiments about life as a whole, sentiments\nwhich may be admiring and adoring, but which need not be so, as the\nexistence of systematic pessimism proves. In this universalistic way of\ntaking the ideal world, the essence of practical religion seems to me to\nevaporate. Both instinctively and for logical reasons, I find it hard to\nbelieve that principles can exist which make no difference in facts.(360)\nBut all facts are particular facts, and the whole interest of the question\nof God\u2019s existence seems to me to lie in the consequences for particulars\nwhich that existence may be expected to entail. That no concrete\nparticular of experience should alter its complexion in consequence of a\nGod being there seems to me an incredible proposition, and yet it is the\nthesis to which (implicitly at any rate) refined supernaturalism seems to\ncling. It is only with experience _en bloc_, it says, that the Absolute\nmaintains relations. It condescends to no transactions of detail.\nI am ignorant of Buddhism and speak under correction, and merely in order\nthe better to describe my general point of view; but as I apprehend the\nBuddhistic doctrine of Karma, I agree in principle with that. All\nsupernaturalists admit that facts are under the judgment of higher law;\nbut for Buddhism as I interpret it, and for religion generally so far as\nit remains unweakened by transcendentalistic metaphysics, the word\n\u201cjudgment\u201d here means no such bare academic verdict or platonic\nappreciation as it means in Vedantic or modern absolutist systems; it\ncarries, on the contrary, _execution_ with it, is _in __ rebus_ as well as\n_post rem_, and operates \u201ccausally\u201d as partial factor in the total fact.\nThe universe becomes a gnosticism(361) pure and simple on any other terms.\nBut this view that judgment and execution go together is that of the\ncrasser supernaturalist way of thinking, so the present volume must on the\nwhole be classed with the other expressions of that creed.\nI state the matter thus bluntly, because the current of thought in\nacademic circles runs against me, and I feel like a man who must set his\nback against an open door quickly if he does not wish to see it closed and\nlocked. In spite of its being so shocking to the reigning intellectual\ntastes, I believe that a candid consideration of piecemeal supernaturalism\nand a complete discussion of all its metaphysical bearings will show it to\nbe the hypothesis by which the largest number of legitimate requirements\nare met. That of course would be a program for other books than this; what\nI now say sufficiently indicates to the philosophic reader the place where\nI belong.\nIf asked just where the differences in fact which are due to God\u2019s\nexistence come in, I should have to say that in general I have no\nhypothesis to offer beyond what the phenomenon of \u201cprayerful communion,\u201d\nespecially when certain kinds of incursion from the subconscious region\ntake part in it, immediately suggests. The appearance is that in this\nphenomenon something ideal, which in one sense is part of ourselves and in\nanother sense is not ourselves, actually exerts an influence, raises our\ncentre of personal energy, and produces regenerative effects unattainable\nin other ways. If, then, there be a wider world of being than that of our\nevery\u2010day consciousness, if in it there be forces whose effects on us are\nintermittent, if one facilitating condition of the effects be the openness\nof the \u201csubliminal\u201d door, we have the elements of a theory to which the\nphenomena of religious life lend plausibility. I am so impressed by the\nimportance of these phenomena that I adopt the hypothesis which they so\nnaturally suggest. At these places at least, I say, it would seem as\nthough transmundane energies, God, if you will, produced immediate effects\nwithin the natural world to which the rest of our experience belongs.\nThe difference in natural \u201cfact\u201d which most of us would assign as the\nfirst difference which the existence of a God ought to make would, I\nimagine, be personal immortality. Religion, in fact, for the great\nmajority of our own race _means_ immortality, and nothing else. God is the\nproducer of immortality; and whoever has doubts of immortality is written\ndown as an atheist without farther trial. I have said nothing in my\nlectures about immortality or the belief therein, for to me it seems a\nsecondary point. If our ideals are only cared for in \u201ceternity,\u201d I do not\nsee why we might not be willing to resign their care to other hands than\nours. Yet I sympathize with the urgent impulse to be present ourselves,\nand in the conflict of impulses, both of them so vague yet both of them\nnoble, I know not how to decide. It seems to me that it is eminently a\ncase for facts to testify. Facts, I think, are yet lacking to prove\n\u201cspirit\u2010return,\u201d though I have the highest respect for the patient labors\nof Messrs. Myers, Hodgson, and Hyslop, and am somewhat impressed by their\nfavorable conclusions. I consequently leave the matter open, with this\nbrief word to save the reader from a possible perplexity as to why\nimmortality got no mention in the body of this book.\nThe ideal power with which we feel ourselves in connection, the \u201cGod\u201d of\nordinary men, is, both by ordinary men and by philosophers, endowed with\ncertain of those metaphysical attributes which in the lecture on\nphilosophy I treated with such disrespect. He is assumed as a matter of\ncourse to be \u201cone and only\u201d and to be \u201cinfinite\u201d; and the notion of many\nfinite gods is one which hardly any one thinks it worth while to consider,\nand still less to uphold. Nevertheless, in the interests of intellectual\nclearness, I feel bound to say that religious experience, as we have\nstudied it, cannot be cited as unequivocally supporting the infinitist\nbelief. The only thing that it unequivocally testifies to is that we can\nexperience union with _something_ larger than ourselves and in that union\nfind our greatest peace. Philosophy, with its passion for unity, and\nmysticism with its monoideistic bent, both \u201cpass to the limit\u201d and\nidentify the something with a unique God who is the all\u2010inclusive soul of\nthe world. Popular opinion, respectful to their authority, follows the\nexample which they set.\nMeanwhile the practical needs and experiences of religion seem to me\nsufficiently met by the belief that beyond each man and in a fashion\ncontinuous with him there exists a larger power which is friendly to him\nand to his ideals. All that the facts require is that the power should be\nboth other and larger than our conscious selves. Anything larger will do,\nif only it be large enough to trust for the next step. It need not be\ninfinite, it need not be solitary. It might conceivably even be only a\nlarger and more godlike self, of which the present self would then be but\nthe mutilated expression, and the universe might conceivably be a\ncollection of such selves, of different degrees of inclusiveness, with no\nabsolute unity realized in it at all.(362) Thus would a sort of polytheism\nreturn upon us\u2014a polytheism which I do not on this occasion defend, for my\nonly aim at present is to keep the testimony of religious experience\nclearly within its proper bounds. [Compare p. 132 above.]\nUpholders of the monistic view will say to such a polytheism (which, by\nthe way, has always been the real religion of common people, and is so\nstill to\u2010day) that unless there be one all\u2010inclusive God, our guarantee of\nsecurity is left imperfect. In the Absolute, and in the Absolute only,\n_all_ is saved. If there be different gods, each caring for his part, some\nportion of some of us might not be covered with divine protection, and our\nreligious consolation would thus fail to be complete. It goes back to what\nwas said on pages 131\u2010133, about the possibility of there being portions\nof the universe that may irretrievably be lost. Common sense is less\nsweeping in its demands than philosophy or mysticism have been wont to be,\nand can suffer the notion of this world being partly saved and partly\nlost. The ordinary moralistic state of mind makes the salvation of the\nworld conditional upon the success with which each unit does its part.\nPartial and conditional salvation is in fact a most familiar notion when\ntaken in the abstract, the only difficulty being to determine the details.\nSome men are even disinterested enough to be willing to be in the unsaved\nremnant as far as their persons go, if only they can be persuaded that\ntheir cause will prevail\u2014all of us are willing, whenever our activity\u2010\nexcitement rises sufficiently high. I think, in fact, that a final\nphilosophy of religion will have to consider the pluralistic hypothesis\nmore seriously than it has hitherto been willing to consider it. For\npractical life at any rate, the _chance_ of salvation is enough. No fact\nin human nature is more characteristic than its willingness to live on a\nchance. The existence of the chance makes the difference, as Edmund Gurney\nsays, between a life of which the keynote is resignation and a life of\nwhich the keynote is hope.(363) But all these statements are\nunsatisfactory from their brevity, and I can only say that I hope to\nreturn to the same questions in another book.\nINDEX.\nAbsolute, oneness with the, 419.\nAbstractness of religious objects, 53.\nACHILLES, 86.\nACKERMANN, MADAME, 63.\nAdaptation to environment, of things, 438;\nof saints, 374\u2010377.\n\u00c6sthetic elements in religions, 460.\nAlacoque, 310, 344, 413.\nAlcohol, 387.\nAL\u2010GHAZZALI, 402.\nALI, 341.\nALLEINE, 228.\nALLINE, 159, 217.\nAlternations of personality, 193.\nALVAREZ DE PAZ, 116.\nAMIEL, 394.\nAn\u00e6sthesia, 288.\nAn\u00e6sthetic revelation, 387\u2010393.\nANGELUS SILESIUS, 417.\nAnger, 181, 264.\n\u201cAnhedonia,\u201d 145.\nAristocratic type, 371.\nARISTOTLE, 495.\nArs, le Cur\u00e9 d\u2019, 302.\nAsceticism, 273, 296\u2010310, 360\u2010365.\nAseity, God\u2019s, 439, 445.\nAtman, 400.\nAttributes of God, 440;\ntheir \u00e6sthetic use, 458.\nAUGUSTINE, SAINT, 171, 361, 496.\nAURELIUS, see MARCUS.\nAutomatic writing, 62, 478.\nAutomatisms, 234, 250, 478\u2010483.\nBALDWIN, 347, 503.\nBASHKIRTSEFF, 83.\nBEECHER, 256.\nBEHMEN, see BOEHME.\nBelief, due to non\u2010rationalistic impulses, 73.\nBESANT, MRS., 23, 168.\nBhagavad\u2010Gita, 361.\nBLAVATSKY, MADAM, 421.\nBLOOD, 389.\nBLUMHARDT, 113.\nBOEHME, 410, 417, 418.\nBOOTH, 203.\nBOUGAUD, 344.\nBOURGET, 263.\nBOURIGNON, 321.\nBOWNE, 502.\nBRAINERD, 212, 253.\nBRAY, 249, 256, 290.\nBROOKS, 512.\nBROWNELL, 515.\nBUCKE, 398.\nBuddhism, 31, 34, 522.\nBuddhist mysticism, 401.\nBULLEN, 287.\nBUNYAN, 157, 160.\nBUTTERWORTH, 411.\nCAIRD, EDWARD, 106.\nCAIRD, J., on feeling in religion, 434;\non absolute self, 450;\nhe does not prove, but reaffirms, religion\u2019s dicta, 453.\nCALL, 289.\nCARLYLE, 41, 300.\nCARPENTER, 319.\nCatharine, Saint, of Genoa, 289.\nCatholicism and Protestantism compared, 114, 227, 336, 461.\nCausality of God, 517, 522.\nCause, 502.\nCENNICK, 301.\nCentres of personal energy, 196, 267, 523.\nCerebration, unconscious, 207.\nChance, 526.\nCHANNING, 300, 488.\nCHAPMAN, 324.\nCharacter, cause of its alterations, 193;\nscheme of its differences of type, 197, 214.\nCauses of its diversity, 261;\nbalance of, 340.\nCharity, 274, 278, 310, 355.\nChastity, 310.\nChiefs of tribes, 371.\nChristian Science, 106.\nChrist\u2019s atonement, 129, 245.\nChurches, 335, 460.\nCLARK, 389.\nCLISSOLD, 481.\nCOE, 240.\nConduct, perfect, 355.\nConfession, 462.\nConsciousness, fields of, 231;\nsubliminal, 233.\nConsistency, 296.\nConversion, to avarice, 178.\nConversion, Fletcher\u2019s, 181;\nTolstoy\u2019s, 184;\nBunyan\u2019s, 186;\nin general, Lectures IX and X, passim;\nBradley\u2019s, 189;\ncompared with natural moral growth, 199;\nHadley\u2019s, 201;\ntwo types of, 205 ff.;\nBrainerd\u2019s, 212;\nAlline\u2019s, 217;\nOxford graduate\u2019s, 221;\nRatisbonne\u2019s, 223;\ninstantaneous, 227;\nis it a natural phenomenon? 230;\nsubliminal action involved, in sudden cases, 236, 240;\nfruits of, 237;\nits momentousness, 239;\nmay be supernatural, 242;\nits concomitants:\nsense of higher control, 244,\nhappiness, 248,\nautomatisms, 250,\nluminous phenomena, 251;\nits degree of permanence, 256.\nCosmic consciousness, 398.\nCounter\u2010conversion, 176.\nCourage, 265, 287.\nCrankiness, see Psychopathy.\nCRICHTON\u2010BROWNE, 384, 386.\nCriminal character, 263.\nCriteria of value of spiritual affections, 18.\nCRUMP, 239.\nCure of bad habits, 270.\nDAUDET, 167.\nDeath, 139, 364.\nDERHAM, 493.\nDesign, argument from, 438, 492 ff.\nDevoutness, 340.\nDIONYSIUS AREOPAGITICUS, 416.\nDisease, 99, 113.\nDisorder in contents of world, 438.\nDivided Self, Lecture VIII, passim;\nCases of:\nSaint Augustine, 172,\nH.

ideas that float in the air of one\u2019s time, this notion\nshrinks from dogmatic general statement and expresses itself only\npartially and by innuendo. It seems to me that few conceptions are\nless instructive than this re\u2010interpretation of religion as\nperverted sexuality. It reminds one, so crudely is it often\nemployed, of the famous Catholic taunt, that the Reformation may be\nbest understood by remembering that its _fons et origo_ was Luther\u2019s\nwish to marry a nun:\u2014the effects are infinitely wider than the\nalleged causes, and for the most part opposite in nature. It is true\nthat in the vast collection of religious phenomena, some are\nundisguisedly amatory\u2014e.g., sex\u2010deities and obscene rites in\npolytheism, and ecstatic feelings of union with the Saviour in a few\nChristian mystics. But then why not equally call religion an\naberration of the digestive function, and prove one\u2019s point by the\nworship of Bacchus and Ceres, or by the ecstatic feelings of some\nother saints about the Eucharist? Religious language clothes itself\nin such poor symbols as our life affords, and the whole organism\ngives overtones of comment whenever the mind is strongly stirred to\nexpression. Language drawn from eating and drinking is probably as\ncommon in religious literature as is language drawn from the sexual\nlife. We \u201chunger and thirst\u201d after righteousness; we \u201cfind the Lord\na sweet savor;\u201d we \u201ctaste and see that he is good.\u201d \u201cSpiritual milk\nfor American babes, drawn from the breasts of both testaments,\u201d is a\nsub\u2010title of the once famous New England Primer, and Christian\ndevotional literature indeed quite floats in milk, thought of from\nthe point of view, not of the mother, but of the greedy babe.\nSaint Fran\u00e7ois de Sales, for instance, thus describes the \u201corison of\nquietude\u201d: \u201cIn this state the soul is like a little child still at\nthe breast, whose mother, to caress him whilst he is still in her\narms, makes her milk distill into his mouth without his even moving\nhis lips. So it is here.... Our Lord desires that our will should be\nsatisfied with sucking the milk which His Majesty pours into our\nmouth, and that we should relish the sweetness without even knowing\nthat it cometh from the Lord.\u201d And again: \u201cConsider the little\ninfants, united and joined to the breasts of their nursing mothers,\nyou will see that from time to time they press themselves closer by\nlittle starts to which the pleasure of sucking prompts them. Even\nso, during its orison, the heart united to its God oftentimes makes\nattempts at closer union by movements during which it presses closer\nupon the divine sweetness.\u201d Chemin de la Perfection, ch. xxxi.;\nAmour de Dieu, vii. ch. i.\nIn fact, one might almost as well interpret religion as a perversion\nof the respiratory function. The Bible is full of the language of\nrespiratory oppression: \u201cHide not thine ear at my breathing; my\ngroaning is not hid from thee; my heart panteth, my strength faileth\nme; my bones are hot with my roaring all the night long; as the hart\npanteth after the water\u2010brooks, so my soul panteth after thee, O my\nGod.\u201d _God\u2019s Breath in Man_ is the title of the chief work of our\nbest known American mystic (Thomas Lake Harris); and in certain non\u2010\nChristian countries the foundation of all religious discipline\nconsists in regulation of the inspiration and expiration.\nThese arguments are as good as much of the reasoning one hears in\nfavor of the sexual theory. But the champions of the latter will\nthen say that their chief argument has no analogue elsewhere. The\ntwo main phenomena of religion, namely, melancholy and conversion,\nthey will say, are essentially phenomena of adolescence, and\ntherefore synchronous with the development of sexual life. To which\nthe retort again is easy. Even were the asserted synchrony\nunrestrictedly true as a fact (which it is not), it is not only the\nsexual life, but the entire higher mental life which awakens during\nadolescence. One might then as well set up the thesis that the\ninterest in mechanics, physics, chemistry, logic, philosophy, and\nsociology, which springs up during adolescent years along with that\nin poetry and religion, is also a perversion of the sexual\ninstinct:\u2014but that would be too absurd. Moreover, if the argument\nfrom synchrony is to decide, what is to be done with the fact that\nthe religious age _par excellence_ would seem to be old age, when\nthe uproar of the sexual life is past?\nThe plain truth is that to interpret religion one must in the end\nlook at the immediate content of the religious consciousness. The\nmoment one does this, one sees how wholly disconnected it is in the\nmain from the content of the sexual consciousness. Everything about\nthe two things differs, objects, moods, faculties concerned, and\nacts impelled to. Any _general_ assimilation is simply impossible:\nwhat we find most often is complete hostility and contrast. If now\nthe defenders of the sex\u2010theory say that this makes no difference to\ntheir thesis; that without the chemical contributions which the sex\u2010\norgans make to the blood, the brain would not be nourished so as to\ncarry on religious activities, this final proposition may be true or\nnot true; but at any rate it has become profoundly uninstructive: we\ncan deduce no consequences from it which help us to interpret\nreligion\u2019s meaning or value. In this sense the religious life\ndepends just as much upon the spleen, the pancreas, and the kidneys\nas on the sexual apparatus, and the whole theory has lost its point\nin evaporating into a vague general assertion of the dependence,\n_somehow_, of the mind upon the body.\n2 For a first\u2010rate example of medical\u2010materialist reasoning, see an\narticle on \u201cles Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s du Type d\u00e9vot,\u201d by Dr. Binet\u2010Sangl\u00e9, in the\nRevue de l\u2019Hypnotisme, xiv. 161.\n3 J.

They are\nreligious in the wider sense; yet in this acutest of all senses they\nare not so, and it is religion in the acutest sense that I wish,\nwithout disputing about words, to study first, so as to get at its\ntypical _differentia_.\n20 The New Spirit, p. 232.\n21 I owe this allegorical illustration to my lamented colleague and\nfriend, Charles Carroll Everett.\n22 Example: \u201cI have had much comfort lately in meditating on the\npassages which show the personality of the Holy Ghost, and his\ndistinctness from the Father and the Son. It is a subject that\nrequires searching into to find out, but, when realized, gives one\nso much more true and lively a sense of the fullness of the Godhead,\nand its work in us and to us, than when only thinking of the Spirit\nin its effect on us.\u201d AUGUSTUS HARE: Memorials, i. 244, Maria Hare\nto Lucy H.

Mind\u2010cure might be briefly called a reaction against all\nthat religion of chronic anxiety which marked the earlier part of\nour century in the evangelical circles of England and America.\n45 I refer to Mr. Horatio W. Dresser and Mr. Henry Wood, especially the\nformer. Mr. Dresser\u2019s works are published by G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons,\nNew York and London; Mr. Wood\u2019s by Lee & Shepard, Boston.\n46 Lest my own testimony be suspected, I will quote another reporter,\nDr. H. H. Goddard, of Clark University, whose thesis on \u201cthe Effects\nof Mind on Body as evidenced by Faith Cures\u201d is published in the\nAmerican Journal of Psychology for 1899 (vol. x.). This critic,\nafter a wide study of the facts, concludes that the cures by mind\u2010\ncure exist, but are in no respect different from those now\nofficially recognized in medicine as cures by suggestion; and the\nend of his essay contains an interesting physiological speculation\nas to the way in which the suggestive ideas may work (p. 67 of the\nreprint). As regards the general phenomenon of mental cure itself,\nDr. Goddard writes: \u201cIn spite of the severe criticism we have made\nof reports of cure, there still remains a vast amount of material,\nshowing a powerful influence of the mind in disease. Many cases are\nof diseases that have been diagnosed and treated by the best\nphysicians of the country, or which prominent hospitals have tried\ntheir hand at curing, but without success. People of culture and\neducation have been treated by this method with satisfactory\nresults. Diseases of long standing have been ameliorated, and even\ncured.... We have traced the mental element through primitive\nmedicine and folk\u2010medicine of to\u2010day, patent medicine, and\nwitchcraft. We are convinced that it is impossible to account for\nthe existence of these practices, if they did not cure disease, and\nthat if they cured disease, it must have been the mental element\nthat was effective. The same argument applies to those modern\nschools of mental therapeutics\u2014Divine Healing and Christian Science.\nIt is hardly conceivable that the large body of intelligent people\nwho comprise the body known distinctively as Mental Scientists\nshould continue to exist if the whole thing were a delusion. It is\nnot a thing of a day; it is not confined to a few; it is not local.\nIt is true that many failures are recorded, but that only adds to\nthe argument. There must be many and striking successes to\ncounterbalance the failures, otherwise the failures would have ended\nthe delusion.... Christian Science, Divine Healing, or Mental\nScience do not, and never can in the very nature of things, cure all\ndiseases; nevertheless, the practical applications of the general\nprinciples of the broadest mental science will tend to prevent\ndisease.... We do find sufficient evidence to convince us that the\nproper reform in mental attitude would relieve many a sufferer of\nills that the ordinary physician cannot touch; would even delay the\napproach of death to many a victim beyond the power of absolute\ncure, and the faithful adherence to a truer philosophy of life will\nkeep many a man well, and give the doctor time to devote to\nalleviating ills that are unpreventable\u201d (pp. 33, 34 of reprint).\n47 HORACE FLETCHER: Happiness as found in Forethought _minus_\nFearthought, Menticulture Series, ii.

According to Harnack, Jesus felt about evil\nand disease much as our mind\u2010curers do. \u201cWhat is the answer which\nJesus sends to John the Baptist?\u201d asks Harnack, and says it is this:\n\u201c \u2018The blind see, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and\nthe deaf hear, the dead rise up, and the gospel is preached to the\npoor.\u2019 That is the \u2018coming of the kingdom,\u2019 or rather in these\nsaving works the kingdom is already there. By the overcoming and\nremoval of misery, of need, of sickness, by these actual effects\nJohn is to see that the new time has arrived. The casting out of\ndevils is only a part of this work of redemption, _but Jesus points\nto that as the sense and seal of his mission_. Thus to the wretched,\nsick, and poor did he address himself, but not as a moralist, and\nwithout a trace of sentimentalism. He never makes groups and\ndepartments of the ills; he never spends time in asking whether the\nsick one \u2018deserves\u2019 to be cured; and it never occurs to him to\nsympathize with the pain or the death. He nowhere says that sickness\nis a beneficent infliction, and that evil has a healthy use. No, he\ncalls sickness sickness and health health. All evil, all\nwretchedness, is for him something dreadful; it is of the great\nkingdom of Satan; but he feels the power of the Saviour within him.\nHe knows that advance is possible only when weakness is overcome,\nwhen sickness is made well.\u201d Das Wesen des Christenthums, 1900, p.\n39.\n51 R. W. TRINE: In Tune with the Infinite, 26th thousand, N. Y., 1899.\nI have strung scattered passages together.\n52 The Cairds, for example. In EDWARD CAIRD\u2019S Glasgow Lectures of\n1890\u201092 passages like this abound:\u2014\n\u201cThe declaration made in the beginning of the ministry of Jesus that\n\u2018the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand,\u2019\npasses with scarce a break into the announcement that \u2018the kingdom\nof God is among you\u2019; and the importance of this announcement is\nasserted to be such that it makes, so to speak, a difference _in\nkind_ between the greatest saints and prophets who lived under the\nprevious reign of division, and \u2018the least in the kingdom of\nheaven.\u2019 The highest ideal is brought close to men and declared to\nbe within their reach, they are called on to be \u2018perfect as their\nFather in heaven is perfect.\u2019 The sense of alienation and distance\nfrom God which had grown upon the pious in Israel just in proportion\nas they had learned to look upon Him as no mere national divinity,\nbut as a God of justice who would punish Israel for its sin as\ncertainly as Edom or Moab, is declared to be no longer in place; and\nthe typical form of Christian prayer points to the abolition of the\ncontrast between this world and the next which through all the\nhistory of the Jews had continually been growing wider: \u2018As in\nheaven, so on earth.\u2019 The sense of the division of man from God, as\na finite being from the Infinite, as weak and sinful from the\nOmnipotent Goodness, is not indeed lost; but it can no longer\noverpower the consciousness of oneness. The terms \u2018Son\u2019 and \u2018Father\u2019\nat once state the opposition and mark its limit. They show that it\nis not an absolute opposition, but one which presupposes an\nindestructible principle of unity, that can and must become a\nprinciple of reconciliation.\u201d The Evolution of Religion, ii. pp.\n146, 147.\n53 It remains to be seen whether the school of Mr. Dresser, which\nassumes more and more the form of mind\u2010cure experience and academic\nphilosophy mutually impregnating each other, will score the\npractical triumphs of the less critical and rational sects.\n54 The theistic explanation is by divine grace, which creates a new\nnature within one the moment the old nature is sincerely given up.\nThe pantheistic explanation (which is that of most mind\u2010curers) is\nby the merging of the narrower private self into the wider or\ngreater self, the spirit of the universe (which is your own\n\u201csubconscious\u201d self), the moment the isolating barriers of mistrust\nand anxiety are removed. The medico\u2010materialistic explanation is\nthat simpler cerebral processes act more freely where they are left\nto act automatically by the shunting\u2010out of physiologically (though\nin this instance not spiritually) \u201chigher\u201d ones which, seeking to\nregulate, only succeed in inhibiting results.\u2014Whether this third\nexplanation might, in a psycho\u2010physical account of the universe, be\ncombined with either of the others may be left an open question\nhere.\n55 Within the churches a disposition has always prevailed to regard\nsickness as a visitation; something sent by God for our good, either\nas chastisement, as warning, or as opportunity for exercising\nvirtue, and, in the Catholic Church, of earning \u201cmerit.\u201d \u201cIllness,\u201d\nsays a good Catholic writer (P. LEJEUNE: Introd. \u00e0 la Vie Mystique,\n1899, p. 218), \u201cis the most excellent of corporeal mortifications,\nthe mortification which one has not one\u2019s self chosen, which is\nimposed directly by God, and is the direct expression of his will.\n\u2018If other mortifications are of silver,\u2019 Mgr. Gay says, \u2018this one is\nof gold; since although it comes of ourselves, coming as it does of\noriginal sin, still on its greater side, as coming (like all that\nhappens) from the providence of God, it is of divine manufacture.\nAnd how just are its blows! And how efficacious it is!... I do not\nhesitate to say that patience in a long illness is mortification\u2019s\nvery masterpiece, and consequently the triumph of mortified\nsouls.\u2019 \u201d According to this view, disease should in any case be\nsubmissively accepted, and it might under certain circumstances even\nbe blasphemous to wish it away.\nOf course there have been exceptions to this, and cures by special\nmiracle have at all times been recognized within the church\u2019s pale,\nalmost all the great saints having more or less performed them. It\nwas one of the heresies of Edward Irving, to maintain them still to\nbe possible. An extremely pure faculty of healing after confession\nand conversion on the patient\u2019s part, and prayer on the priest\u2019s,\nwas quite spontaneously developed in the German pastor, Joh.\nChristoph Blumhardt, in the early forties and exerted during nearly\nthirty years. Blumhardt\u2019s Life by Z\u00fcndel (5th edition, Zurich, 1887)\ngives in chapters ix., x., xi., and xvii. a pretty full account of\nhis healing activity, which he invariably ascribed to direct divine\ninterposition. Blumhardt was a singularly pure, simple, and non\u2010\nfanatical character, and in this part of his work followed no\nprevious model. In Chicago to\u2010day we have the case of Dr. J. A.\nDowie, a Scottish Baptist preacher, whose weekly \u201cLeaves of Healing\u201d\nwere in the year of grace 1900 in their sixth volume, and who,\nalthough he denounces the cures wrought in other sects as\n\u201cdiabolical counterfeits\u201d of his own exclusively \u201cDivine Healing,\u201d\nmust on the whole be counted into the mind\u2010cure movement. In mind\u2010\ncure circles the fundamental article of faith is that disease should\nnever be accepted. It is wholly of the pit. God wants us to be\nabsolutely healthy, and we should not tolerate ourselves on any\nlower terms.\n56 Edwards, from whose book on the Revival in New England I quote these\nwords, dissuades from such a use of prayer, but it is easy to see\nthat he enjoys making his thrust at the cold dead church members.\n57 H.

(abridged).\n69 I say this in spite of the monistic utterances of many mind\u2010cure\nwriters; for these utterances are really inconsistent with their\nattitude towards disease, and can easily be shown not to be\nlogically involved in the experiences of union with a higher\nPresence with which they connect themselves. The higher Presence,\nnamely, need not be the absolute whole of things, it is quite\nsufficient for the life of religious experience to regard it as a\npart, if only it be the most ideal part.\n70 Cf.

MILSAND: Luther et le Serf\u2010Arbitre, 1884, _passim_.\n71 He adds with characteristic healthy\u2010mindedness: \u201cOur business is to\ncontinue to fail in good spirits.\u201d\n72 The God of many men is little more than their court of appeal\nagainst the damnatory judgment passed on their failures by the\nopinion of this world. To our own consciousness there is usually a\nresiduum of worth left over after our sins and errors have been told\noff\u2014our capacity of acknowledging and regretting them is the germ of\na better self _in posse_ at least. But the world deals with us _in\nactu_ and not _in posse_: and of this hidden germ, not to be guessed\nat from without, it never takes account. Then we turn to the All\u2010\nknower, who knows our bad, but knows this good in us also, and who\nis just. We cast ourselves with our repentance on his mercy: only by\nan All\u2010knower can we finally be judged. So the need of a God very\ndefinitely emerges from this sort of experience of life.\n73 E.g., Iliad, XVII. 446: \u201cNothing then is more wretched anywhere than\nman of all that breathes and creeps upon this earth.\u201d\n74 E.g., Theognis, 425\u2010428: \u201cBest of all for all things upon earth is\nit not to be born nor to behold the splendors of the Sun; next best\nto traverse as soon as possible the gates of Hades.\u201d See also the\nalmost identical passage in \u0152dipus in Colonus, 1225.\u2014The Anthology\nis full of pessimistic utterances: \u201cNaked came I upon the earth,\nnaked I go below the ground\u2014why then do I vainly toil when I see the\nend naked before me?\u201d\u2014\u201cHow did I come to be? Whence am I? Wherefore\ndid I come? To pass away. How can I learn aught when naught I know?\nBeing naught I came to life: once more shall I be what I was.\nNothing and nothingness is the whole race of mortals.\u201d\u2014\u201cFor death we\nare all cherished and fattened like a herd of hogs that is wantonly\nbutchered.\u201d\nThe difference between Greek pessimism and the oriental and modern\nvariety is that the Greeks had not made the discovery that the\npathetic mood may be idealized, and figure as a higher form of\nsensibility. Their spirit was still too essentially masculine for\npessimism to be elaborated or lengthily dwelt on in their classic\nliterature. They would have despised a life set wholly in a minor\nkey, and summoned it to keep within the proper bounds of\nlachrymosity. The discovery that the enduring emphasis, so far as\nthis world goes, may be laid on its pain and failure, was reserved\nfor races more complex, and (so to speak) more feminine than the\nHellenes had attained to being in the classic period. But all the\nsame was the outlook of those Hellenes blackly pessimistic.\n75 For instance, on the very day on which I write this page, the post\nbrings me some aphorisms from a worldly\u2010wise old friend in\nHeidelberg which may serve as a good contemporaneous expression of\nEpicureanism: \u201cBy the word \u2018happiness\u2019 every human being understands\nsomething different. It is a phantom pursued only by weaker minds.\nThe wise man is satisfied with the more modest but much more\ndefinite term _contentment_. What education should chiefly aim at is\nto save us from a discontented life. Health is one favoring\ncondition, but by no means an indispensable one, of contentment.\nWoman\u2019s heart and love are a shrewd device of Nature, a trap which\nshe sets for the average man, to force him into working. But the\nwise man will always prefer work chosen by himself.\u201d\n76 RIBOT: Psychologie des sentiments, p. 54.\n77 A. GRATRY: Souvenirs de ma jeunesse, 1880, pp. 119\u2010121, abridged.\nSome persons are affected with anhedonia permanently, or at any rate\nwith a loss of the usual appetite for life. The annals of suicide\nsupply such examples as the following:\u2014\nAn uneducated domestic servant, aged nineteen, poisons herself, and\nleaves two letters expressing her motive for the act. To her parents\nshe writes:\u2014\n\u201cLife is sweet perhaps to some, but I prefer what is sweeter than\nlife, and that is death. So good\u2010by forever, my dear parents. It is\nnobody\u2019s fault, but a strong desire of my own which I have longed to\nfulfill for three or four years. I have always had a hope that some\nday I might have an opportunity of fulfilling it, and now it has\ncome.... It is a wonder I have put this off so long, but I thought\nperhaps I should cheer up a bit and put all thought out of my head.\u201d\nTo her brother she writes: \u201cGood\u2010by forever, my own dearest brother.\nBy the time you get this I shall be gone forever.

I owe my acquaintance with this book to my colleague, Dr.\nBenjamin Rand.\n83 Compare Bunyan: \u201cThere was I struck into a very great trembling,\ninsomuch that at some times I could, for days together, feel my very\nbody, as well as my mind, to shake and totter under the sense of the\ndreadful judgment of God, that should fall on those that have sinned\nthat most fearful and unpardonable sin. I felt also such clogging\nand heat at my stomach, by reason of this my terror, that I was,\nespecially at some times, as if my breast\u2010bone would have split\nasunder.... Thus did I wind, and twine, and shrink, under the burden\nthat was upon me; which burden also did so oppress me that I could\nneither stand, nor go, nor lie, either at rest or quiet.\u201d\n84 For another case of fear equally sudden, see HENRY JAMES: Society\nthe Redeemed Form of Man, Boston, 1879, pp. 43 ff.\n85 Example: \u201cIt was about eleven o\u2019clock at night ... but I strolled on\nstill with the people.... Suddenly upon the left side of our road, a\ncrackling was heard among the bushes; all of us were alarmed, and in\nan instant a tiger, rushing out of the jungle, pounced upon the one\nof the party that was foremost, and carried him off in the twinkling\nof an eye. The rush of the animal, and the crush of the poor\nvictim\u2019s bones in his mouth, and his last cry of distress, \u2018Ho hai!\u2019\ninvoluntarily re\u00ebchoed by all of us, was over in three seconds; and\nthen I know not what happened till I returned to my senses, when I\nfound myself and companions lying down on the ground as if prepared\nto be devoured by our enemy, the sovereign of the forest. I find my\npen incapable of describing the terror of that dreadful moment. Our\nlimbs stiffened, our power of speech ceased, and our hearts beat\nviolently, and only a whisper of the same \u2018Ho hai!\u2019 was heard from\nus. In this state we crept on all fours for some distance back, and\nthen ran for life with the speed of an Arab horse for about half an\nhour, and fortunately happened to come to a small village.... After\nthis every one of us was attacked with fever, attended with\nshivering, in which deplorable state we remained till\nmorning.\u201d\u2014Autobiography of Lutfullah, a Mohammedan Gentleman,\nLeipzig, 1857, p. 112.\n86 E.g., \u201cOur young people are diseased with the theological problems\nof original sin, origin of evil, predestination, and the like.

D. 386) that the\naccount he gives in the Confessions is premature. The crisis in the\ngarden marked a definitive conversion from his former life, but it\nwas to the neo\u2010platonic spiritualism and only a halfway stage toward\nChristianity. The latter he appears not fully and radically to have\nembraced until four years more had passed.\n92 Confessions, Book VIII., chaps. v., vii., xi., abridged.\n93 TH. JOUFFROY: Nouveaux M\u00e9langes philosophiques, 2me \u00e9dition, p. 83.\nI add two other cases of counter\u2010conversion dating from a certain\nmoment. The first is from Professor Starbuck\u2019s manuscript\ncollection, and the narrator is a woman.\n\u201cAway down in the bottom of my heart, I believe I was always more or\nless skeptical about \u2018God;\u2019 skepticism grew as an undercurrent, all\nthrough my early youth, but it was controlled and covered by the\nemotional elements in my religious growth. When I was sixteen I\njoined the church and was asked if I loved God. I replied \u2018Yes,\u2019 as\nwas customary and expected. But instantly with a flash something\nspoke within me, \u2018No, you do not.\u2019 I was haunted for a long time\nwith shame and remorse for my falsehood and for my wickedness in not\nloving God, mingled with fear that there might be an avenging God\nwho would punish me in some terrible way.... At nineteen, I had an\nattack of tonsilitis. Before I had quite recovered, I heard told a\nstory of a brute who had kicked his wife downstairs, and then\ncontinued the operation until she became insensible. I felt the\nhorror of the thing keenly. Instantly this thought flashed through\nmy mind: \u2018I have no use for a God who permits such things.\u2019 This\nexperience was followed by months of stoical indifference to the God\nof my previous life, mingled with feelings of positive dislike and a\nsomewhat proud defiance of him. I still thought there might be a\nGod. If so he would probably damn me, but I should have to stand it.\nI felt very little fear and no desire to propitiate him. I have\nnever had any personal relations with him since this painful\nexperience.\u201d\nThe second case exemplifies how small an additional stimulus will\noverthrow the mind into a new state of equilibrium when the process\nof preparation and incubation has proceeded far enough. It is like\nthe proverbial last straw added to the camel\u2019s burden, or that touch\nof a needle which makes the salt in a supersaturated fluid suddenly\nbegin to crystallize out.\nTolstoy writes: \u201cS., a frank and intelligent man, told me as follows\nhow he ceased to believe:\u2014\n\u201cHe was twenty\u2010six years old when one day on a hunting expedition,\nthe time for sleep having come, he set himself to pray according to\nthe custom he had held from childhood.\n\u201cHis brother, who was hunting with him, lay upon the hay and looked\nat him. When S. had finished his prayer and was turning to sleep,\nthe brother said, \u2018Do you still keep up that thing?\u2019 Nothing more\nwas said. But since that day, now more than thirty years ago, S. has\nnever prayed again; he never takes communion, and does not go to\nchurch. All this, not because he became acquainted with convictions\nof his brother which he then and there adopted; not because he made\nany new resolution in his soul, but merely because the words spoken\nby his brother were like the light push of a finger against a\nleaning wall already about to tumble by its own weight. These words\nbut showed him that the place wherein he supposed religion dwelt in\nhim had long been empty, and that the sentences he uttered, the\ncrosses and bows which he made during his prayer, were actions with\nno inner sense. Having once seized their absurdity, he could no\nlonger keep them up.\u201d My Confession, p. 8.\n94 Op. cit., Letter III., abridged.\nI subjoin an additional document which has come into my possession,\nand which represents in a vivid way what is probably a very frequent\nsort of conversion, if the opposite of \u201cfalling in love,\u201d falling\nout of love, may be so termed. Falling in love also conforms\nfrequently to this type, a latent process of unconscious preparation\noften preceding a sudden awakening to the fact that the mischief is\nirretrievably done. The free and easy tone in this narrative gives\nit a sincerity that speaks for itself.\n\u201cFor two years of this time I went through a very bad experience,\nwhich almost drove me mad. I had fallen violently in love with a\ngirl who, young as she was, had a spirit of coquetry like a cat. As\nI look back on her now, I hate her, and wonder how I could ever have\nfallen so low as to be worked upon to such an extent by her\nattractions. Nevertheless, I fell into a regular fever, could think\nof nothing else; whenever I was alone, I pictured her attractions,\nand spent most of the time when I should have been working, in\nrecalling our previous interviews, and imagining future\nconversations. She was very pretty, good humored, and jolly to the\nlast degree, and intensely pleased with my admiration. Would give me\nno decided answer yes or no, and the queer thing about it was that\nwhilst pursuing her for her hand, I secretly knew all along that she\nwas unfit to be a wife for me, and that she never would say yes.\nAlthough for a year we took our meals at the same boarding\u2010house, so\nthat I saw her continually and familiarly, our closer relations had\nto be largely on the sly, and this fact, together with my jealousy\nof another one of her male admirers, and my own conscience despising\nme for my uncontrollable weakness, made me so nervous and sleepless\nthat I really thought I should become insane. I understand well\nthose young men murdering their sweethearts, which appear so often\nin the papers. Nevertheless I did love her passionately, and in some\nways she did deserve it.\n\u201cThe queer thing was the sudden and unexpected way in which it all\nstopped. I was going to my work after breakfast one morning,\nthinking as usual of her and of my misery, when, just as if some\noutside power laid hold of me, I found myself turning round and\nalmost running to my room, where I immediately got out all the\nrelics of her which I possessed, including some hair, all her notes\nand letters, and ambrotypes on glass. The former I made a fire of,\nthe latter I actually crushed beneath my heel, in a sort of fierce\njoy of revenge and punishment. I now loathed and despised her\naltogether, and as for myself I felt as if a load of disease had\nsuddenly been removed from me. That was the end. I never spoke to\nher or wrote to her again in all the subsequent years, and I have\nnever had a single moment of loving thought towards one who for so\nmany months entirely filled my heart. In fact, I have always rather\nhated her memory, though now I can see that I had gone unnecessarily\nfar in that direction. At any rate, from that happy morning onward I\nregained possession of my own proper soul, and have never since\nfallen into any similar trap.\u201d\nThis seems to me an unusually clear example of two different levels\nof personality, inconsistent in their dictates, yet so well balanced\nagainst each other as for a long time to fill the life with discord\nand dissatisfaction. At last, not gradually, but in a sudden crisis,\nthe unstable equilibrium is resolved, and this happens so\nunexpectedly that it is as if, to use the writer\u2019s words, \u201csome\noutside power laid hold.\u201d\nProfessor Starbuck gives an analogous case, and a converse case of\nhatred suddenly turning into love, in his Psychology of Religion, p.\n141. Compare the other highly curious instances which he gives on\npp. 137\u2010144, of sudden non\u2010religious alterations of habit or\ncharacter. He seems right in conceiving all such sudden changes as\nresults of special cerebral functions unconsciously developing until\nthey are ready to play a controlling part, when they make irruption\ninto the conscious life. When we treat of sudden \u201cconversion,\u201d I\nshall make as much use as I can of this hypothesis of subconscious\nincubation.\n95 H.

Madison,\nConnecticut, 1830.\n99 Jouffroy is an example: \u201cDown this slope it was that my intelligence\nhad glided, and little by little it had got far from its first\nfaith. But this melancholy revolution had not taken place in the\nbroad daylight of my consciousness; too many scruples, too many\nguides and sacred affections had made it dreadful to me, so that I\nwas far from avowing to myself the progress it had made. It had gone\non in silence, by an involuntary elaboration of which I was not the\naccomplice; and although I had in reality long ceased to be a\nChristian, yet, in the innocence of my intention, I should have\nshuddered to suspect it, and thought it calumny had I been accused\nof such a falling away.\u201d Then follows Jouffroy\u2019s account of his\ncounter\u2010conversion, quoted above on p. 176.\n100 One hardly needs examples; but for love, see p. 179, note; for fear,\np. 162; for remorse, see Othello after the murder; for anger, see\nLear after Cordelia\u2019s first speech to him; for resolve, see p. 178\n(J. Foster case). Here is a pathological case in which _guilt_ was\nthe feeling that suddenly exploded: \u201cOne night I was seized on\nentering bed with a rigor, such as Swedenborg describes as coming\nover him with a sense of holiness, but over me with a sense of\n_guilt_. During that whole night I lay under the influence of the\nrigor, and from its inception I felt that I was under the curse of\nGod. I have never done one act of duty in my life\u2014sins against God\nand man, beginning as far as my memory goes back\u2014a wildcat in human\nshape.\u201d\n101 E. D. STARBUCK: The Psychology of Religion, pp. 224, 262.\n102 No one understands this better than Jonathan Edwards understood it\nalready. Conversion narratives of the more commonplace sort must\nalways be taken with the allowances which he suggests: \u201cA rule\nreceived and established by common consent has a very great, though\nto many persons an insensible influence in forming their notions of\nthe process of their own experience. I know very well how they\nproceed as to this matter, for I have had frequent opportunities of\nobserving their conduct. Very often their experience at first\nappears like a confused chaos, but then those parts are selected\nwhich bear the nearest resemblance to such particular steps as are\ninsisted on; and these are dwelt upon in their thoughts, and spoken\nof from time to time, till they grow more and more conspicuous in\ntheir view, and other parts which are neglected grow more and more\nobscure. Thus what they have experienced is insensibly strained, so\nas to bring it to an exact conformity to the scheme already\nestablished in their minds. And it becomes natural also for\nministers, who have to deal with those who insist upon distinctness\nand clearness of method, to do so too.\u201d Treatise on Religious\nAffections.\n103 Studies in the Psychology of Religious Phenomena, American Journal\nof Psychology, vii. 309 (1896).\n104 I have abridged Mr. Hadley\u2019s account.

Compare, also, pp. 137\u2010144 and 262.\n110 For instance, C. G. Finney italicizes the volitional element: \u201cJust\nat this point the whole question of Gospel salvation opened to my\nmind in a manner most marvelous to me at the time. I think I then\nsaw, as clearly as I ever have in my life, the reality and fullness\nof the atonement of Christ. Gospel salvation seemed to me to be an\noffer of something to be accepted, and all that was necessary on my\npart was to get my own consent to give up my sins and accept Christ.\nAfter this distinct revelation had stood for some little time before\nmy mind, the question seemed to be put, \u2018Will you accept it now, to\u2010\nday?\u2019 I replied, \u2018Yes; _I will accept it to\u2010day, or I will die in\nthe attempt!_\u2019 \u201d He then went into the woods, where he describes his\nstruggles. He could not pray, his heart was hardened in its pride.\n\u201cI then reproached myself for having promised to give my heart to\nGod before I left the woods. When I came to try, I found I could\nnot.... My inward soul hung back, and there was no going out of my\nheart to God. The thought was pressing me, of the rashness of my\npromise that I would give my heart to God that day, or die in the\nattempt. It seemed to me as if that was binding on my soul; and yet\nI was going to break my vow. A great sinking and discouragement came\nover me, and I felt almost too weak to stand upon my knees. Just at\nthis moment I again thought I heard some one approach me, and I\nopened my eyes to see whether it were so. But right there the\nrevelation of my pride of heart, as the great difficulty that stood\nin the way, was distinctly shown to me. An overwhelming sense of my\nwickedness in being ashamed to have a human being see me on my knees\nbefore God took such powerful possession of me, that I _cried at the\ntop of my voice, and exclaimed that I would not leave that place if\nall the men on earth and all the devils in hell surrounded me_.\n\u2018What!\u2019 I said, \u2018such a degraded sinner as I am, on my knees\nconfessing my sins to the great and holy God; and ashamed to have\nany human being, and a sinner like myself, find me on my knees\nendeavoring to make my peace with my offended God!\u2019 The sin appeared\nawful, infinite. It broke me down before the Lord.\u201d Memoirs, pp.\n14\u201016, abridged.\n111 STARBUCK: Op. cit., pp. 91, 114.\n112 Extracts from the Journal of Mr. John Nelson, London, no date, p.\n24.\n113 STARBUCK, p. 64.\n114 STARBUCK, p. 115.\n115 STARBUCK, p. 113.\n116 EDWARD\u2019S and DWIGHT\u2019S Life of Brainerd, New Haven, 1822, pp. 45\u201047,\nabridged.\n117 Describing the whole phenomenon as a change of equilibrium, we might\nsay that the movement of new psychic energies towards the personal\ncentre and the recession of old ones towards the margin (or the\nrising of some objects above, and the sinking of others below the\nconscious threshold) were only two ways of describing an indivisible\nevent. Doubtless this is often absolutely true, and Starbuck is\nright when he says that \u201cself\u2010surrender\u201d and \u201cnew determination,\u201d\nthough seeming at first sight to be such different experiences, are\n\u201creally the same thing.

M. A. Ratisbonne, Ferrara, 1843, which I have\nto thank Monsignore D. O\u2019Connell of Rome for bringing to my notice.\nI abridge the original.\n122 Published in the International Scientific Series.\n123 The reader will here please notice that in my exclusive reliance in\nthe last lecture on the subconscious \u201cincubation\u201d of motives\ndeposited by a growing experience, I followed the method of\nemploying accepted principles of explanation as far as one can. The\nsubliminal region, whatever else it may be, is at any rate a place\nnow admitted by psychologists to exist for the accumulation of\nvestiges of sensible experience (whether inattentively or\nattentively registered), and for their elaboration according to\nordinary psychological or logical laws into results that end by\nattaining such a \u201ctension\u201d that they may at times enter\nconsciousness with something like a burst. It thus is \u201cscientific\u201d\nto interpret all otherwise unaccountable invasive alterations of\nconsciousness as results of the tension of subliminal memories\nreaching the bursting\u2010point. But candor obliges me to confess that\nthere are occasional bursts into consciousness of results of which\nit is not easy to demonstrate any prolonged subconscious incubation.\nSome of the cases I used to illustrate the sense of presence of the\nunseen in Lecture III were of this order (compare pages 59, 61, 62,\n67); and we shall see other experiences of the kind when we come to\nthe subject of mysticism. The case of Mr. Bradley, that of M.\nRatisbonne, possibly that of Colonel Gardiner, possibly that of\nSaint Paul, might not be so easily explained in this simple way. The\nresult, then, would have to be ascribed either to a merely\nphysiological nerve storm, a \u201cdischarging lesion\u201d like that of\nepilepsy; or, in case it were useful and rational, as in the two\nlatter cases named, to some more mystical or theological hypothesis.\nI make this remark in order that the reader may realize that the\nsubject is really complex. But I shall keep myself as far as\npossible at present to the more \u201cscientific\u201d view; and only as the\nplot thickens in subsequent lectures shall I consider the question\nof its absolute sufficiency as an explanation of all the facts. That\nsubconscious incubation explains a great number of them, there can\nbe no doubt.\n124 Edwards says elsewhere: \u201cI am bold to say that the work of God in\nthe conversion of one soul, considered together with the source,\nfoundation, and purchase of it, and also the benefit, end, and\neternal issue of it, is a more glorious work of God than the\ncreation of the whole material universe.\u201d\n125 Emerson writes: \u201cWhen we see a soul whose acts are regal, graceful,\nand pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such things can be and\nare, and not turn sourly on the angel and say: Crump is a better\nman, with his grunting resistance to all his native devils.\u201d True\nenough. Yet Crump may really be the better _Crump_, for his inner\ndiscords and second birth; and your once\u2010born \u201cregal\u201d character,\nthough indeed always better than poor Crump, may fall far short of\nwhat he individually might be had he only some Crump\u2010like capacity\nfor compunction over his own peculiar diabolisms, graceful and\npleasant and invariably gentlemanly as these may be.\n126 In his book, The Spiritual Life, New York, 1900.\n127 Op. cit., p. 112.\n128 Op. cit., p. 144.\n129 I piece together a quotation made by W.

Why does he not say \u201cthe\natoning work\u201d?\u2019 Then these words, \u2018It is finished,\u2019 presented\nthemselves to my mind. \u2018What is it that is finished?\u2019 I asked, and\nin an instant my mind replied: \u2018A perfect expiation for sin; entire\nsatisfaction has been given; the debt has been paid by the\nSubstitute. Christ has died for our sins; not for ours only, but for\nthose of all men. If, then, the entire work is finished, all the\ndebt paid, what remains for me to do?\u2019 In another instant the light\nwas shed through my mind by the Holy Ghost, and the joyous\nconviction was given me that nothing more was to be done, save to\nfall on my knees, to accept this Saviour and his love, to praise God\nforever.\u201d Autobiography of Hudson Taylor. I translate back into\nEnglish from the French translation of Challand (Geneva, no date),\nthe original not being accessible.\n132 Tolstoy\u2019s case was a good comment on those words. There was almost\nno theology in his conversion.

SPRAGUE: Lectures on Revivals of Religion, New\nYork, 1832, in the long Appendix to which the opinions of a large\nnumber of ministers are given.\n138 Memoirs, p. 34.\n139 These reports of sensorial photism shade off into what are evidently\nonly metaphorical accounts of the sense of new spiritual\nillumination, as, for instance, in Brainerd\u2019s statement: \u201cAs I was\nwalking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory seemed to open to the\napprehension of my soul. I do not mean any external brightness, for\nI saw no such thing, nor any imagination of a body of light in the\nthird heavens, or anything of that nature, but it was a new inward\napprehension or view that I had of God.\u201d\nIn a case like this next one from Starbuck\u2019s manuscript collection,\nthe lighting up of the darkness is probably also metaphorical:\u2014\n\u201cOne Sunday night, I resolved that when I got home to the ranch\nwhere I was working, I would offer myself with my faculties and all\nto God to be used only by and for him.... It was raining and the\nroads were muddy; but this desire grew so strong that I kneeled down\nby the side of the road and told God all about it, intending then to\nget up and go on. Such a thing as any special answer to my prayer\nnever entered my mind, having been converted by faith, but still\nbeing most undoubtedly saved. Well, while I was praying, I remember\nholding out my hands to God and telling him they should work for\nhim, my feet walk for him, my tongue speak for him, etc., etc., if\nhe would only use me as his instrument and give me a satisfying\nexperience\u2014when suddenly the darkness of the night seemed lit up\u2014I\nfelt, realized, knew, that God heard and answered my prayer. Deep\nhappiness came over me; I felt I was accepted into the inner circle\nof God\u2019s loved ones.\u201d\nIn the following case also the flash of light is metaphorical:\u2014\n\u201cA prayer meeting had been called for at close of evening service.\nThe minister supposed me impressed by his discourse (a mistake\u2014he\nwas dull). He came and, placing his hand upon my shoulder, said: \u2018Do\nyou not want to give your heart to God?\u2019 I replied in the\naffirmative. Then said he, \u2018Come to the front seat.\u2019 They sang and\nprayed and talked with me. I experienced nothing but unaccountable\nwretchedness. They declared that the reason why I did not \u2018obtain\npeace\u2019 was because I was not willing to give up all to God. After\nabout two hours the minister said we would go home. As usual, on\nretiring, I prayed. In great distress, I at this time simply said,\n\u2018Lord, I have done all I can, I leave the whole matter with thee.\u2019\nImmediately, like a flash of light, there came to me a great peace,\nand I arose and went into my parents\u2019 bedroom and said, \u2018I do feel\nso wonderfully happy.\u2019 This I regard as the hour of conversion. It\nwas the hour in which I became assured of divine acceptance and\nfavor. So far as my life was concerned, it made little immediate\nchange.\u201d\n140 I add in a note a few more records:\u2014\n\u201cOne morning, being in deep distress, fearing every moment I should\ndrop into hell, I was constrained to cry in earnest for mercy, and\nthe Lord came to my relief, and delivered my soul from the burden\nand guilt of sin. My whole frame was in a tremor from head to foot,\nand my soul enjoyed sweet peace. The pleasure I then felt was\nindescribable. The happiness lasted about three days, during which\ntime I never spoke to any person about my feelings.\u201d Autobiography\nof DAN YOUNG, edited by W. P. STRICKLAND, New York, 1860.\n\u201cIn an instant there rose up in me such a sense of God\u2019s taking care\nof those who put their trust in him that for an hour all the world\nwas crystalline, the heavens were lucid, and I sprang to my feet and\nbegan to cry and laugh.\u201d H. W. BEECHER, quoted by LEUBA.\n\u201cMy tears of sorrow changed to joy, and I lay there praising God in\nsuch ecstasy of joy as only the soul who experiences it can\nrealize.\u201d\u2014\u201cI cannot express how I felt. It was as if I had been in a\ndark dungeon and lifted into the light of the sun. I shouted and I\nsang praise unto him who loved me and washed me from my sins. I was\nforced to retire into a secret place, for the tears did flow, and I\ndid not wish my shopmates to see me, and yet I could not keep it a\nsecret.\u201d\u2014\u201cI experienced joy almost to weeping.\u201d\u2014\u201cI felt my face must\nhave shone like that of Moses. I had a general feeling of buoyancy.\nIt was the greatest joy it was ever my lot to experience.\u201d\u2014\u201cI wept\nand laughed alternately. I was as light as if walking on air. I felt\nas if I had gained greater peace and happiness than I had ever\nexpected to experience.\u201d STARBUCK\u2019S correspondents.\n141 Psychology of Religion, pp. 360, 357.\n142 SAINTE\u2010BEUVE: Port\u2010Royal, vol. i. pp. 95 and 106, abridged.\n143 \u201c \u2018Love would not be love,\u2019 says Bourget, \u2018unless it could carry one\nto crime.\u2019 And so one may say that no passion would be a veritable\npassion unless it could carry one to crime.\u201d (SIGHELE: Psychologie\ndes Sectes, p. 136.) In other words, great passions annul the\nordinary inhibitions set by \u201cconscience.\u201d And conversely, of all the\ncriminal human beings, the false, cowardly, sensual, or cruel\npersons who actually live, there is perhaps not one whose criminal\nimpulse may not be at some moment overpowered by the presence of\nsome other emotion to which his character is also potentially\nliable, provided that other emotion be only made intense enough.\nFear is usually the most available emotion for this result in this\nparticular class of persons. It stands for conscience, and may here\nbe classed appropriately as a \u201chigher affection.\u201d If we are soon to\ndie, or if we believe a day of judgment to be near at hand, how\nquickly do we put our moral house in order\u2014we do not see how sin can\nevermore exert temptation over us! Old\u2010fashioned hell\u2010fire\nChristianity well knew how to extract from fear its full equivalent\nin the way of fruits for repentance, and its full conversion value.\n144 Example: Benjamin Constant was often marveled at as an extraordinary\ninstance of superior intelligence with inferior character. He writes\n(Journal, Paris, 1895, p. 56), \u201cI am tossed and dragged about by my\nmiserable weakness. Never was anything so ridiculous as my\nindecision. Now marriage, now solitude; now Germany, now France,\nhesitation upon hesitation, and all because at bottom I am _unable\nto give up anything_.\u201d He can\u2019t \u201cget mad\u201d at any of his\nalternatives; and the career of a man beset by such an all\u2010round\namiability is hopeless.\n145 The great thing which the higher excitabilities give is _courage_;\nand the addition or subtraction of a certain amount of this quality\nmakes a different man, a different life. Various excitements let the\ncourage loose. Trustful hope will do it; inspiring example will do\nit; love will do it; wrath will do it. In some people it is natively\nso high that the mere touch of danger does it, though danger is for\nmost men the great inhibitor of action. \u201cLove of adventure\u201d becomes\nin such persons a ruling passion. \u201cI believe,\u201d says General\nSkobeleff, \u201cthat my bravery is simply the passion and at the same\ntime the contempt of danger. The risk of life fills me with an\nexaggerated rapture. The fewer there are to share it, the more I\nlike it. The participation of my body in the event is required to\nfurnish me an adequate excitement. Everything intellectual appears\nto me to be reflex; but a meeting of man to man, a duel, a danger\ninto which I can throw myself headforemost, attracts me, moves me,\nintoxicates me. I am crazy for it, I love it, I adore it. I run\nafter danger as one runs after women; I wish it never to stop. Were\nit always the same, it would always bring me a new pleasure. When I\nthrow myself into an adventure in which I hope to find it, my heart\npalpitates with the uncertainty; I could wish at once to have it\nappear and yet to delay. A sort of painful and delicious shiver\nshakes me; my entire nature runs to meet the peril with an impetus\nthat my will would in vain try to resist.\u201d (JULIETTE ADAM: Le\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ral Skobeleff, Nouvelle Revue, 1886, abridged.) Skobeleff seems\nto have been a cruel egoist; but the disinterested Garibaldi, if one\nmay judge by his \u201cMemorie,\u201d lived in an unflagging emotion of\nsimilar danger\u2010seeking excitement.\n146 See the case on p. 70, above, where the writer describes his\nexperiences of communion with the Divine as consisting \u201cmerely in\nthe _temporary obliteration of the conventionalities_ which usually\ncover my life.\u201d\n147 Above, p. 201. \u201cThe only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is\nreligiomania,\u201d is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical\nman.\n148 Doddridge\u2019s Life of Colonel James Gardiner, London Religious Tract\nSociety, pp. 23\u201032.\n149 Here, for example, is a case, from Starbuck\u2019s book, in which a\n\u201csensory automatism\u201d brought about quickly what prayers and resolves\nhad been unable to effect. The subject is a woman. She writes:\u2014\n\u201cWhen I was about forty I tried to quit smoking, but the desire was\non me, and had me in its power. I cried and prayed and promised God\nto quit, but could not. I had smoked for fifteen years. When I was\nfifty\u2010three, as I sat by the fire one day smoking, a voice came to\nme. I did not hear it with my ears, but more as a dream or sort of\ndouble think. It said, \u2018Louisa, lay down smoking.\u2019 At once I\nreplied, \u2018Will you take the desire away?\u2019 But it only kept saying:\n\u2018Louisa, lay down smoking.\u2019 Then I got up, laid my pipe on the\nmantel\u2010shelf, and never smoked again or had any desire to. The\ndesire was gone as though I had never known it or touched tobacco.\nThe sight of others smoking and the smell of smoke never gave me the\nleast wish to touch it again.\u201d The Psychology of Religion, p. 142.\n150 Professor Starbuck expresses the radical destruction of old\ninfluences physiologically, as a cutting off of the connection\nbetween higher and lower cerebral centres. \u201cThis condition,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cin which the association\u2010centres connected with the spiritual\nlife are cut off from the lower, is often reflected in the way\ncorrespondents describe their experiences.... For example:\n\u2018Temptations from without still assail me, but there is nothing\n_within_ to respond to them.\u2019 The ego [here] is wholly identified\nwith the higher centres, whose quality of feeling is that of\nwithinness. Another of the respondents says: \u2018Since then, although\nSatan tempts me, there is as it were a wall of brass around me, so\nthat his darts cannot touch me.\u2019 \u201d\u2014Unquestionably, functional\nexclusions of this sort must occur in the cerebral organ. But on the\nside accessible to introspection, their causal condition is nothing\nbut the degree of spiritual excitement, getting at last so high and\nstrong as to be sovereign; and it must be frankly confessed that we\ndo not know just why or how such sovereignty comes about in one\nperson and not in another. We can only give our imagination a\ncertain delusive help by mechanical analogies.\nIf we should conceive, for example, that the human mind, with its\ndifferent possibilities of equilibrium, might be like a many\u2010sided\nsolid with different surfaces on which it could lie flat, we might\nliken mental revolutions to the spatial revolutions of such a body.\nAs it is pried up, say by a lever, from a position in which it lies\non surface A, for instance, it will linger for a time unstably\nhalfway up, and if the lever cease to urge it, it will tumble back\nor \u201crelapse\u201d under the continued pull of gravity. But if at last it\nrotate far enough for its centre of gravity to pass beyond surface A\naltogether, the body will fall over, on surface B, say, and abide\nthere permanently. The pulls of gravity towards A have vanished, and\nmay now be disregarded. The polyhedron has become immune against\nfarther attraction from their direction.\nIn this figure of speech the lever may correspond to the emotional\ninfluences making for a new life, and the initial pull of gravity to\nthe ancient drawbacks and inhibitions. So long as the emotional\ninfluence fails to reach a certain pitch of efficacy, the changes it\nproduces are unstable, and the man relapses into his original\nattitude. But when a certain intensity is attained by the new\nemotion, a critical point is passed, and there then ensues an\nirreversible revolution, equivalent to the production of a new\nnature.\n151 I use this word in spite of a certain flavor of \u201csanctimoniousness\u201d\nwhich sometimes clings to it, because no other word suggests as well\nthe exact combination of affections which the text goes on to\ndescribe.\n152 \u201cIt will be found,\u201d says Dr. W. R. INGE (in his lectures on\nChristian Mysticism, London, 1899, p. 326), \u201cthat men of pre\u00ebminent\nsaintliness agree very closely in what they tell us. They tell us\nthat they have arrived at an unshakable conviction, not based on\ninference but on immediate experience, that God is a spirit with\nwhom the human spirit can hold intercourse; that in him meet all\nthat they can imagine of goodness, truth, and beauty; that they can\nsee his footprints everywhere in nature, and feel his presence\nwithin them as the very life of their life, so that in proportion as\nthey come to themselves they come to him. They tell us what\nseparates us from him and from happiness is, first, self\u2010seeking in\nall its forms; and, secondly, sensuality in all its forms; that\nthese are the ways of darkness and death, which hide from us the\nface of God; while the path of the just is like a shining light,\nwhich shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d\n153 The \u201centhusiasm of humanity\u201d may lead to a life which coalesces in\nmany respects with that of Christian saintliness. Take the following\nrules proposed to members of the Union pour l\u2019Action morale, in the\nBulletin de l\u2019Union, April 1\u201015, 1894. See, also, Revue Bleue,\nAugust 13, 1892.\n\u201cWe would make known in our own persons the usefulness of rule, of\ndiscipline, of resignation and renunciation; we would teach the\nnecessary perpetuity of suffering, and explain the creative part\nwhich it plays. We would wage war upon false optimism; on the base\nhope of happiness coming to us ready made; on the notion of a\nsalvation by knowledge alone, or by material civilization alone,\nvain symbol as this is of civilization, precarious external\narrangement, ill\u2010fitted to replace the intimate union and consent of\nsouls. We would wage war also on bad morals, whether in public or in\nprivate life; on luxury, fastidiousness, and over\u2010refinement; on all\nthat tends to increase the painful, immoral, and anti\u2010social\nmultiplication of our wants; on all that excites envy and dislike in\nthe soul of the common people, and confirms the notion that the\nchief end of life is freedom to enjoy. We would preach by our\nexample the respect of superiors and equals, the respect of all men;\naffectionate simplicity in our relations with inferiors and\ninsignificant persons; indulgence where our own claims only are\nconcerned, but firmness in our demands where they relate to duties\ntowards others or towards the public.\n\u201cFor the common people are what we help them to become; their vices\nare our vices, gazed upon, envied, and imitated; and if they come\nback with all their weight upon us, it is but just.\u201d\n154 Above, pp. 248 ff.\n155 H.

He loved me so much that he seemed to pervade my being, at a\ntime when I could be only imperfectly conscious of his presence. My\nsleep is sometimes broken,\u2014a sort of half sleep; but my soul seems\nto be awake enough to know God, when it is hardly capable of knowing\nanything else.\u201d T. C.

On being asked why he permitted\nthe animal thus to dirty his clothes, Towianski replied: \u2018This dog,\nwhom I am now meeting for the first time, has shown a great fellow\u2010\nfeeling for me, and a great joy in my recognition and acceptance of\nhis greetings. Were I to drive him off, I should wound his feelings\nand do him a moral injury. It would be an offense not only to him,\nbut to all the spirits of the other world who are on the same level\nwith him. The damage which he does to my coat is as nothing in\ncomparison with the wrong which I should inflict upon him, in case I\nwere to remain indifferent to the manifestations of his friendship.\nWe ought,\u2019 he added, \u2018both to lighten the condition of animals,\nwhenever we can, and at the same time to facilitate in ourselves\nthat union of the world of all spirits, which the sacrifice of\nChrist has made possible.\u2019 \u201d Andr\u00e9 Towianski, Traduction de\nl\u2019Italien, Turin, 1897 (privately printed).

Then\nhe asked him if he would give up to be used of the Lord the four\nhundred dollars he had laid up, and he said he would, and thus the\nLord saved him. The thought came to me at once that I had never made\na real consecration either of myself or of my property to the Lord,\nbut had always tried to serve the Lord in _my_ way. Now the Lord\nasked me if I would serve him in _his_ way, and go out alone and\npenniless if he so ordered. The question was pressed home, and I\nmust decide: To forsake all and have him, or have all and lose him!\nI soon decided to take him; and the blessed assurance came, that he\nhad taken me for his own, and my joy was full. I returned home from\nthe meeting with feelings as simple as a child. I thought all would\nbe glad to hear of the joy of the Lord that possessed me, and so I\nbegan to tell the simple story. But to my great surprise, the\npastors (for I attended meetings in three churches) opposed the\nexperience and said it was fanaticism, and one told the members of\nhis church to shun those that professed it, and I soon found that my\nfoes were those of my own household.\u201d\n196 J.

Vamb\u00e9ry\ndescribes a dervish whom he met in Persia, \u201cwho had solemnly vowed,\nthirty years before, that he would never employ his organs of speech\notherwise but in uttering, everlastingly, the name of his favorite,\n_Ali, Ali_. He thus wished to signify to the world that he was the\nmost devoted partisan of that Ali who had been dead a thousand\nyears. In his own home, speaking with his wife, children, and\nfriends, no other word but \u2018Ali!\u2019 ever passed his lips. If he wanted\nfood or drink or anything else, he expressed his wants still by\nrepeating \u2018Ali!\u2019 Begging or buying at the bazaar, it was always\n\u2018Ali!\u2019 Treated ill or generously, he would still harp on his\nmonotonous \u2018Ali!\u2019 Latterly his zeal assumed such tremendous\nproportions that, like a madman, he would race, the whole day, up\nand down the streets of the town, throwing his stick high up into\nthe air, and shriek out, all the while, at the top of his voice,\n\u2018Ali!\u2019 This dervish was venerated by everybody as a saint, and\nreceived everywhere with the greatest distinction.\u201d ARMINIUS\nVAMB\u00c9RY, his Life and Adventures, written by Himself, London, 1889,\np. 69.

After having\ngently breathed them in, He arose, and said with a gratified air to\nthe Saints, as if contented with what He had done: \u2018See the new\npresent which my betrothed has given Me!\u2019\n\u201cOne day, at chapel, she heard supernaturally sung the words,\n\u2018_Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus_.\u2019 The Son of God leaning towards her\nlike a sweet lover, and giving to her soul the softest kiss, said to\nher at the second Sanctus: \u2018In this _Sanctus_ addressed to my\nperson, receive with this kiss all the sanctity of my divinity and\nof my humanity, and let it be to thee a sufficient preparation for\napproaching the communion table.\u2019 And the next following Sunday,\nwhile she was thanking God for this favor, behold the Son of God,\nmore beauteous than thousands of angels, takes her in His arms as if\nHe were proud of her, and presents her to God the Father, in that\nperfection of sanctity with which He had dowered her. And the Father\ntook such delight in this soul thus presented by His only Son, that,\nas if unable longer to restrain Himself, He gave her, and the Holy\nGhost gave her also, the Sanctity attributed to each by His own\n_Sanctus_\u2014and thus she remained endowed with the plenary fullness of\nthe blessing of _Sanctity_, bestowed on her by Omnipotence, by\nWisdom, and by Love.\u201d R\u00e9v\u00e9lations de Sainte Gertrude, Paris, 1898,\ni. 44, 186.\n205 FURNEAUX JORDAN: Character in Birth and Parentage, first edition.\nLater editions change the nomenclature.\n206 As to this distinction, see the admirably practical account in J.

MURISIER (Les Maladies du\nSentiment Religieux, Paris, 1901), who makes inner unification the\nmainspring of the whole religious life. But _all_ strongly ideal\ninterests, religious or irreligious, unify the mind and tend to\nsubordinate everything to themselves. One would infer from M.\nMurisier\u2019s pages that this formal condition was peculiarly\ncharacteristic of religion, and that one might in comparison almost\nneglect material content, in studying the latter. I trust that the\npresent work will convince the reader that religion has plenty of\nmaterial content which is characteristic, and which is more\nimportant by far than any general psychological form. In spite of\nthis criticism, I find M. Murisier\u2019s book highly instructive.\n208 Example: \u201cAt the first beginning of the Servitor\u2019s [Suso\u2019s] interior\nlife, after he had purified his soul properly by confession, he\nmarked out for himself, in thought, three circles, within which he\nshut himself up, as in a spiritual intrenchment. The first circle\nwas his cell, his chapel, and the choir. When he was within this\ncircle, he seemed to himself in complete security. The second circle\nwas the whole monastery as far as the outer gate. The third and\noutermost circle was the gate itself, and here it was necessary for\nhim to stand well upon his guard. When he went outside these\ncircles, it seemed to him that he was in the plight of some wild\nanimal which is outside its hole, and surrounded by the hunt, and\ntherefore in need of all its cunning and watchfulness.\u201d The Life of\nthe Blessed Henry Suso, by Himself, translated by KNOX, London,\n1865, p. 168.\n209 Vie des premi\u00e8res Religieuses Dominicaines de la Congr\u00e9gation de St.\nDominique, \u00e0 Nancy; Nancy, 1896, p. 129.\n210 MESCHLER\u2019S Life of Saint Louis of Gonzaga, French translation by\nLEBR\u00c9QUIER, 1891; p. 40.\n211 In his boyish note\u2010book he praises the monastic life for its freedom\nfrom sin, and for the imperishable treasures, which it enables us to\nstore up, \u201cof merit in God\u2019s eyes which makes of Him our debtor for\nall Eternity.\u201d Loc. cit., p. 62.\n212 Mademoiselle Mori, a novel quoted in HARE\u2019S Walks in Rome, 1900, i.\n55.\nI cannot resist the temptation to quote from Starbuck\u2019s book, p.\n388, another case of purification by elimination. It runs as\nfollows:\u2014\n\u201cThe signs of abnormality which sanctified persons show are of\nfrequent occurrence. They get out of tune with other people; often\nthey will have nothing to do with churches, which they regard as\nworldly; they become hypercritical towards others; they grow\ncareless of their social, political, and financial obligations. As\nan instance of this type may be mentioned a woman of sixty\u2010eight of\nwhom the writer made a special study. She had been a member of one\nof the most active and progressive churches in a busy part of a\nlarge city. Her pastor described her as having reached the\ncensorious stage. She had grown more and more out of sympathy with\nthe church; her connection with it finally consisted simply in\nattendance at prayer\u2010meeting, at which her only message was that of\nreproof and condemnation of the others for living on a low plane. At\nlast she withdrew from fellowship with any church. The writer found\nher living alone in a little room on the top story of a cheap\nboarding\u2010house, quite out of touch with all human relations, but\napparently happy in the enjoyment of her own spiritual blessings.\nHer time was occupied in writing booklets on sanctification\u2014page\nafter page of dreamy rhapsody. She proved to be one of a small group\nof persons who claim that entire salvation involves three steps\ninstead of two; not only must there be conversion and\nsanctification, but a third, which they call \u2018crucifixion\u2019 or\n\u2018perfect redemption,\u2019 and which seems to bear the same relation to\nsanctification that this bears to conversion. She related how the\nSpirit had said to her, \u2018Stop going to church. Stop going to\nholiness meetings. Go to your own room and I will teach you.\u2019 She\nprofesses to care nothing for colleges, or preachers, or churches,\nbut only cares to listen to what God says to her. Her description of\nher experience seemed entirely consistent; she is happy and\ncontented, and her life is entirely satisfactory to herself. While\nlistening to her own story, one was tempted to forget that it was\nfrom the life of a person who could not live by it in conjunction\nwith her fellows.\u201d\n213 The best missionary lives abound in the victorious combination of\nnon\u2010resistance with personal authority. John G. Paton, for example,\nin the New Hebrides, among brutish Melanesian cannibals, preserves a\ncharmed life by dint of it. When it comes to the point, no one ever\ndares actually to strike him. Native converts, inspired by him,\nshowed analogous virtue. \u201cOne of our chiefs, full of the Christ\u2010\nkindled desire to seek and to save, sent a message to an inland\nchief, that he and four attendants would come on Sabbath and tell\nthem the gospel of Jehovah God. The reply came back sternly\nforbidding their visit, and threatening with death any Christian\nthat approached their village. Our chief sent in response a loving\nmessage, telling them that Jehovah had taught the Christians to\nreturn good for evil, and that they would come unarmed to tell them\nthe story of how the Son of God came into the world and died in\norder to bless and save his enemies. The heathen chief sent back a\nstern and prompt reply once more: \u2018If you come, you will be killed.\u2019\nOn Sabbath morn the Christian chief and his four companions were met\noutside the village by the heathen chief, who implored and\nthreatened them once more. But the former said:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018We come to you without weapons of war! We come only to tell you\nabout Jesus. We believe that He will protect us to\u2010day.\u2019\n\u201cAs they pressed steadily forward towards the village, spears began\nto be thrown at them. Some they evaded, being all except one\ndexterous warriors; and others they literally received with their\nbare hands, and turned them aside in an incredible manner. The\nheathen, apparently thunderstruck at these men thus approaching them\nwithout weapons of war, and not even flinging back their own spears\nwhich they had caught, after having thrown what the old chief called\n\u2018a shower of spears,\u2019 desisted from mere surprise. Our Christian\nchief called out, as he and his companions drew up in the midst of\nthem on the village public ground:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018Jehovah thus protects us. He has given us all your spears! Once\nwe would have thrown them back at you and killed you. But now we\ncome, not to fight but to tell you about Jesus. He has changed our\ndark hearts. He asks you now to lay down all these your other\nweapons of war, and to hear what we can tell you about the love of\nGod, our great Father, the only living God.\u2019\n\u201cThe heathen were perfectly overawed. They manifestly looked on\nthese Christians as protected by some Invisible One. They listened\nfor the first time to the story of the Gospel and of the Cross. We\nlived to see that chief and all his tribe sitting in the school of\nChrist. And there is perhaps not an island in these southern seas,\namongst all those won for Christ, where similar acts of heroism on\nthe part of converts cannot be recited.\u201d JOHN G. PATON, Missionary\nto the New Hebrides, An Autobiography, second part, London, 1890, p.\n243.\n214 Saint Peter, Saint Teresa tells us in her autobiography (French\ntranslation, p. 333), \u201chad passed forty years without ever sleeping\nmore than an hour and a half a day. Of all his mortifications, this\nwas the one that had cost him the most. To compass it, he kept\nalways on his knees or on his feet. The little sleep he allowed\nnature to take was snatched in a sitting posture, his head leaning\nagainst a piece of wood fixed in the wall. Even had he wished to lie\ndown, it would have been impossible, because his cell was only four\nfeet and a half long. In the course of all these years he never\nraised his hood, no matter what the ardor of the sun or the rain\u2019s\nstrength. He never put on a shoe. He wore a garment of coarse\nsackcloth, with nothing else upon his skin. This garment was as\nscant as possible, and over it a little cloak of the same stuff.\nWhen the cold was great he took off the cloak and opened for a while\nthe door and little window of his cell. Then he closed them and\nresumed the mantle,\u2014his way, as he told us, of warming himself, and\nmaking his body feel a better temperature. It was a frequent thing\nwith him to eat once only in three days; and when I expressed my\nsurprise, he said that it was very easy if one once had acquired the\nhabit. One of his companions has assured me that he has gone\nsometimes eight days without food.... His poverty was extreme; and\nhis mortification, even in his youth, was such that he told me he\nhad passed three years in a house of his order without knowing any\nof the monks otherwise than by the sound of their voice, for he\nnever raised his eyes, and only found his way about by following the\nothers. He showed this same modesty on public highways. He spent\nmany years without ever laying eyes upon a woman; but he confessed\nto me that at the age he had reached it was indifferent to him\nwhether he laid eyes on them or not. He was very old when I first\ncame to know him, and his body so attenuated that it seemed formed\nof nothing so much as of so many roots of trees. With all this\nsanctity he was very affable. He never spoke unless he was\nquestioned, but his intellectual right\u2010mindedness and grace gave to\nall his words an irresistible charm.\u201d\n215 F.

In a letter to Mr. B. P.

This has come\nupon me through repeating my own name to myself silently, till all\nat once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of\nindividuality, individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away\ninto boundless being, and this not a confused state but the\nclearest, the surest of the surest, utterly beyond words\u2014where death\nwas an almost laughable impossibility\u2014the loss of personality (if so\nit were) seeming no extinction, but the only true life. I am ashamed\nof my feeble description. Have I not said the state is utterly\nbeyond words?\u201d\nProfessor Tyndall, in a letter, recalls Tennyson saying of this\ncondition: \u201cBy God Almighty! there is no delusion in the matter! It\nis no nebulous ecstasy, but a state of transcendent wonder,\nassociated with absolute clearness of mind.\u201d Memoirs of Alfred\nTennyson, ii. 473.\n227 The Lancet, July 6 and 13, 1895, reprinted as the Cavendish Lecture,\non Dreamy Mental States, London, Bailli\u00e8re, 1895.

The notion is thoroughly characteristic of the mystical\nlevel, and the _Aufgabe_ of making it articulate was surely set to\nHegel\u2019s intellect by mystical feeling.\n232 BENJAMIN PAUL BLOOD: The An\u00e6sthetic Revelation and the Gist of\nPhilosophy, Amsterdam, N. Y., 1874, pp. 35, 36. Mr. Blood has made\nseveral attempts to adumbrate the an\u00e6sthetic revelation, in\npamphlets of rare literary distinction, privately printed and\ndistributed by himself at Amsterdam. Xenos Clark, a philosopher, who\ndied young at Amherst in the \u201980\u2019s, much lamented by those who knew\nhim, was also impressed by the revelation. \u201cIn the first place,\u201d he\nonce wrote to me, \u201cMr. Blood and I agree that the revelation is, if\nanything, non\u2010emotional. It is utterly flat. It is, as Mr. Blood\nsays, \u2018the one sole and sufficient insight why, or not why, but how,\nthe present is pushed on by the past, and sucked forward by the\nvacuity of the future. Its inevitableness defeats all attempts at\nstopping or accounting for it. It is all precedence and\npresupposition, and questioning is in regard to it forever too late.\nIt is an _initiation of the past_.\u2019 The real secret would be the\nformula by which the \u2018now\u2019 keeps exfoliating out of itself, yet\nnever escapes. What is it, indeed, that keeps existence exfoliating?\nThe formal being of anything, the logical definition of it, is\nstatic. For mere logic every question contains its own answer\u2014we\nsimply fill the hole with the dirt we dug out. Why are twice two\nfour? Because, in fact, four is twice two. Thus logic finds in life\nno propulsion, only a momentum. It goes because it is a\u2010going. But\nthe revelation adds: it goes because it is and _was_ a\u2010going. You\nwalk, as it were, round yourself in the revelation. Ordinary\nphilosophy is like a hound hunting his own trail. The more he hunts\nthe farther he has to go, and his nose never catches up with his\nheels, because it is forever ahead of them. So the present is\nalready a foregone conclusion, and I am ever too late to understand\nit. But at the moment of recovery from an\u00e6sthesis, just then,\n_before starting on life_, I catch, so to speak, a glimpse of my\nheels, a glimpse of the eternal process just in the act of starting.\nThe truth is that we travel on a journey that was accomplished\nbefore we set out; and the real end of philosophy is accomplished,\nnot when we arrive at, but when we remain in, our destination (being\nalready there),\u2014which may occur vicariously in this life when we\ncease our intellectual questioning. That is why there is a smile\nupon the face of the revelation, as we view it. It tells us that we\nare forever half a second too late\u2014that\u2019s all. \u2018You could kiss your\nown lips, and have all the fun to yourself,\u2019 it says, if you only\nknew the trick. It would be perfectly easy if they would just stay\nthere till you got round to them. Why don\u2019t you manage it somehow?\u201d\nDialectically minded readers of this farrago will at least recognize\nthe region of thought of which Mr. Clark writes, as familiar. In his\nlatest pamphlet, \u201cTennyson\u2019s Trances and the An\u00e6sthetic Revelation,\u201d\nMr. Blood describes its value for life as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe An\u00e6sthetic Revelation is the Initiation of Man into the\nImmemorial Mystery of the Open Secret of Being, revealed as the\nInevitable Vortex of Continuity. Inevitable is the word. Its motive\nis inherent\u2014it is what has to be. It is not for any love or hate,\nnor for joy nor sorrow, nor good nor ill. End, beginning, or\npurpose, it knows not of.\n\u201cIt affords no particular of the multiplicity and variety of things;\nbut it fills appreciation of the historical and the sacred with a\nsecular and intimately personal illumination of the nature and\nmotive of existence, which then seems reminiscent\u2014as if it should\nhave appeared, or shall yet appear, to every participant thereof.\n\u201cAlthough it is at first startling in its solemnity, it becomes\ndirectly such a matter of course\u2014so old\u2010fashioned, and so akin to\nproverbs, that it inspires exultation rather than fear, and a sense\nof safety, as identified with the aboriginal and the universal. But\nno words may express the imposing certainty of the patient that he\nis realizing the primordial, Adamic surprise of Life.\n\u201cRepetition of the experience finds it ever the same, and as if it\ncould not possibly be otherwise. The subject resumes his normal\nconsciousness only to partially and fitfully remember its\noccurrence, and to try to formulate its baffling import,\u2014with only\nthis consolatory afterthought: that he has known the oldest truth,\nand that he has done with human theories as to the origin, meaning,\nor destiny of the race. He is beyond instruction in \u2018spiritual\nthings.\u2019\n\u201cThe lesson is one of central safety: the Kingdom is within. All\ndays are judgment days: but there can be no climacteric purpose of\neternity, nor any scheme of the whole. The astronomer abridges the\nrow of bewildering figures by increasing his unit of measurement: so\nmay we reduce the distracting multiplicity of things to the unity\nfor which each of us stands.\n\u201cThis has been my moral sustenance since I have known of it. In my\nfirst printed mention of it I declared: \u2018The world is no more the\nalien terror that was taught me. Spurning the cloud\u2010grimed and still\nsultry battlements whence so lately Jehovan thunders boomed, my gray\ngull lifts her wing against the nightfall, and takes the dim leagues\nwith a fearless eye.\u2019 And now, after twenty\u2010seven years of this\nexperience, the wing is grayer, but the eye is fearless still, while\nI renew and doubly emphasize that declaration. I know\u2014as having\nknown\u2014the meaning of Existence: the sane centre of the universe\u2014at\nonce the wonder and the assurance of the soul\u2014for which the speech\nof reason has as yet no name but the An\u00e6sthetic Revelation.\u201d\u2014I have\nconsiderably abridged the quotation.\n233 Op. cit., pp. 78\u201080, abridged. I subjoin, also abridging it, another\ninteresting an\u00e6sthetic revelation communicated to me in manuscript\nby a friend in England. The subject, a gifted woman, was taking\nether for a surgical operation.\n\u201cI wondered if I was in a prison being tortured, and why I\nremembered having heard it said that people \u2018learn through\nsuffering,\u2019 and in view of what I was seeing, the inadequacy of this\nsaying struck me so much that I said, aloud, \u2018to suffer _is_ to\nlearn.\u2019\n\u201cWith that I became unconscious again, and my last dream immediately\npreceded my real coming to. It only lasted a few seconds, and was\nmost vivid and real to me, though it may not be clear in words.\n\u201cA great Being or Power was traveling through the sky, his foot was\non a kind of lightning as a wheel is on a rail, it was his pathway.\nThe lightning was made entirely of the spirits of innumerable people\nclose to one another, and I was one of them. He moved in a straight\nline, and each part of the streak or flash came into its short\nconscious existence only that he might travel. I seemed to be\ndirectly under the foot of God, and I thought he was grinding his\nown life up out of my pain. Then I saw that what he had been trying\nwith all his might to do was to _change his course_, to _bend_ the\nline of lightning to which he was tied, in the direction in which he\nwanted to go. I felt my flexibility and helplessness, and knew that\nhe would succeed. He bended me, turning his corner by means of my\nhurt, hurting me more than I had ever been hurt in my life, and at\nthe acutest point of this, as he passed, I _saw_. I understood for a\nmoment things that I have now forgotten, things that no one could\nremember while retaining sanity. The angle was an obtuse angle, and\nI remember thinking as I woke that had he made it a right or acute\nangle, I should have both suffered and \u2018seen\u2019 still more, and should\nprobably have died.\n\u201cHe went on and I came to. In that moment the whole of my life\npassed before me, including each little meaningless piece of\ndistress, and I _understood_ them. _This_ was what it had all meant,\n_this_ was the piece of work it had all been contributing to do. I\ndid not see God\u2019s purpose, I only saw his intentness and his entire\nrelentlessness towards his means. He thought no more of me than a\nman thinks of hurting a cork when he is opening wine, or hurting a\ncartridge when he is firing. And yet, on waking, my first feeling\nwas, and it came with tears, \u2018Domine non sum digna,\u2019 for I had been\nlifted into a position for which I was too small. I realized that in\nthat half hour under ether I had served God more distinctly and\npurely than I had ever done in my life before, or that I am capable\nof desiring to do. I was the means of his achieving and revealing\nsomething, I know not what or to whom, and that, to the exact extent\nof my capacity for suffering.\n\u201cWhile regaining consciousness, I wondered why, since I had gone so\ndeep, I had seen nothing of what the saints call the _love_ of God,\nnothing but his relentlessness. And then I heard an answer, which I\ncould only just catch, saying, \u2018Knowledge and Love are One, and the\n_measure_ is suffering\u2019\u2014I give the words as they came to me. With\nthat I came finally to (into what seemed a dream world compared with\nthe reality of what I was leaving), and I saw that what would be\ncalled the \u2018cause\u2019 of my experience was a slight operation under\ninsufficient ether, in a bed pushed up against a window, a common\ncity window in a common city street. If I had to formulate a few of\nthe things I then caught a glimpse of, they would run somewhat as\nfollows:\u2014\n\u201cThe eternal necessity of suffering and its eternal vicariousness.\nThe veiled and incommunicable nature of the worst sufferings;\u2014the\npassivity of genius, how it is essentially instrumental and\ndefenseless, moved, not moving, it must do what it does;\u2014the\nimpossibility of discovery without its price;\u2014finally, the excess of\nwhat the suffering \u2018seer\u2019 or genius pays over what his generation\ngains. (He seems like one who sweats his life out to earn enough to\nsave a district from famine, and just as he staggers back, dying and\nsatisfied, bringing a lac of rupees to buy grain with, God lifts the\nlac away, dropping _one_ rupee, and says, \u2018That you may give them.\nThat you have earned for them. The rest is for ME.\u2019) I perceived\nalso in a way never to be forgotten, the excess of what we see over\nwhat we can demonstrate.\n\u201cAnd so on!\u2014these things may seem to you delusions, or truisms; but\nfor me they are dark truths, and the power to put them into even\nsuch words as these has been given me by an ether dream.\u201d\n234 In Tune with the Infinite, p. 137.\n235 The larger God may then swallow up the smaller one. I take this from\nStarbuck\u2019s manuscript collection:\u2014\n\u201cI never lost the consciousness of the presence of God until I stood\nat the foot of the Horseshoe Falls, Niagara. Then I lost him in the\nimmensity of what I saw. I also lost myself, feeling that I was an\natom too small for the notice of Almighty God.\u201d\nI subjoin another similar case from Starbuck\u2019s collection:\u2014\n\u201cIn that time the consciousness of God\u2019s nearness came to me\nsometimes. I say God, to describe what is indescribable. A presence,\nI might say, yet that is too suggestive of personality, and the\nmoments of which I speak did not hold the consciousness of a\npersonality, but something in myself made me feel myself a part of\nsomething bigger than I, that was controlling. I felt myself one\nwith the grass, the trees, birds, insects, everything in Nature. I\nexulted in the mere fact of existence, of being a part of it all\u2014the\ndrizzling rain, the shadows of the clouds, the tree\u2010trunks, and so\non. In the years following, such moments continued to come, but I\nwanted them constantly. I knew so well the satisfaction of losing\nself in a perception of supreme power and love, that I was unhappy\nbecause that perception was not constant.\u201d The cases quoted in my\nthird lecture, pp. 66, 67, 70, are still better ones of this type.\nIn her essay, The Loss of Personality, in The Atlantic Monthly (vol.\nlxxxv. p. 195), Miss Ethel D. Puffer explains that the vanishing of\nthe sense of self, and the feeling of immediate unity with the\nobject, is due to the disappearance, in these rapturous experiences,\nof the motor adjustments which habitually intermediate between the\nconstant background of consciousness (which is the Self) and the\nobject in the foreground, whatever it may be. I must refer the\nreader to the highly instructive article, which seems to me to throw\nlight upon the psychological conditions, though it fails to account\nfor the rapture or the revelation\u2010value of the experience in the\nSubject\u2019s eyes.\n236 Op. cit., i. 43\u201044.\n237 Memoiren einer Idealistin, 5te Auflage, 1900, iii. 166. For years\nshe had been unable to pray, owing to materialistic belief.\n238 Whitman in another place expresses in a quieter way what was\nprobably with him a chronic mystical perception: \u201cThere is,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201capart from mere intellect, in the make\u2010up of every superior\nhuman identity, a wondrous something that realizes without argument,\nfrequently without what is called education (though I think it the\ngoal and apex of all education deserving the name), an intuition of\nthe absolute balance, in time and space, of the whole of this\nmultifariousness, this revel of fools, and incredible make\u2010believe\nand general unsettledness, we call _the world_; a soul\u2010sight of that\ndivine clue and unseen thread which holds the whole congeries of\nthings, all history and time, and all events, however trivial,\nhowever momentous, like a leashed dog in the hand of the hunter.\n[Of] such soul\u2010sight and root\u2010centre for the mind mere optimism\nexplains only the surface.\u201d Whitman charges it against Carlyle that\nhe lacked this perception.

Through the mastery which the yogi attains over his\nthoughts and his body, he grows into a \u2018character.\u2019 By the\nsubjection of his impulses and propensities to his will, and the\nfixing of the latter upon the ideal of goodness, he becomes a\n\u2018personality\u2019 hard to influence by others, and thus almost the\nopposite of what we usually imagine a \u2018medium\u2019 so\u2010called, or\n\u2018psychic subject\u2019 to be.\u201d KARL KELLNER: Yoga: Eine Skizze, M\u00fcnchen,\n1896, p. 21.\n245 I follow the account in C.

These phenomena, which\nmystics have often presented (or are believed to have presented),\nhave no essential mystical significance, for they occur with no\nconsciousness of illumination whatever, when they occur, as they\noften do, in persons of non\u2010mystical mind. Consciousness of\nillumination is for us the essential mark of \u201cmystical\u201d states.\n252 The Interior Castle, Fifth Abode, ch. i., in \u0152uvres, translated by\nBouix, iii. 421\u2010424.\n253 BARTOLI\u2010MICHEL: Vie de Saint Ignace de Loyola, i. 34\u201036. Others have\nhad illuminations about the created world, Jacob Boehme, for\ninstance. At the age of twenty\u2010five he was \u201csurrounded by the divine\nlight, and replenished with the heavenly knowledge; insomuch as\ngoing abroad into the fields to a green, at G\u00f6rlitz, he there sat\ndown, and viewing the herbs and grass of the field, in his inward\nlight he saw into their essences, use, and properties, which was\ndiscovered to him by their lineaments, figures, and signatures.\u201d Of\na later period of experience he writes: \u201cIn one quarter of an hour I\nsaw and knew more than if I had been many years together at an\nuniversity. For I saw and knew the being of all things, the Byss and\nthe Abyss, and the eternal generation of the holy Trinity, the\ndescent and original of the world and of all creatures through the\ndivine wisdom. I knew and saw in myself all the three worlds, the\nexternal and visible world being of a procreation or extern birth\nfrom both the internal and spiritual worlds; and I saw and knew the\nwhole working essence, in the evil and in the good, and the mutual\noriginal and existence; and likewise how the fruitful bearing womb\nof eternity brought forth. So that I did not only greatly wonder at\nit, but did also exceedingly rejoice, albeit I could very hardly\napprehend the same in my external man and set it down with the pen.\nFor I had a thorough view of the universe as in a chaos, wherein all\nthings are couched and wrapt up, but it was impossible for me to\nexplicate the same.\u201d Jacob Behmen\u2019s Theosophic Philosophy, etc., by\nEDWARD TAYLOR, London, 1691, pp. 425, 427, abridged.

It is not so much\na habitation, an association, as a sort of fusion. Oh, new and\nblessed life! life which becomes each day more luminous.... The wall\nbefore me, dark a few moments since, is splendid at this hour\nbecause the sun shines on it. Wherever its rays fall they light up a\nconflagration of glory; the smallest speck of glass sparkles, each\ngrain of sand emits fire; even so there is a royal song of triumph\nin my heart because the Lord is there. My days succeed each other;\nyesterday a blue sky; to\u2010day a clouded sun; a night filled with\nstrange dreams; but as soon as the eyes open, and I regain\nconsciousness and seem to begin life again, it is always the same\nfigure before me, always the same presence filling my heart....\nFormerly the day was dulled by the absence of the Lord. I used to\nwake invaded by all sorts of sad impressions, and I did not find him\non my path. To\u2010day he is with me; and the light cloudiness which\ncovers things is not an obstacle to my communion with him. I feel\nthe pressure of his hand, I feel something else which fills me with\na serene joy; shall I dare to speak it out? Yes, for it is the true\nexpression of what I experience. The Holy Spirit is not merely\nmaking me a visit; it is no mere dazzling apparition which may from\none moment to another spread its wings and leave me in my night, it\nis a permanent habitation. He can depart only if he takes me with\nhim. More than that; he is not other than myself: he is one with me.\nIt is not a juxtaposition, it is a penetration, a profound\nmodification of my nature, a new manner of my being.\u201d Quoted from\nthe MS. \u201cof an old man\u201d by WILFRED MONOD: Il Vit: six m\u00e9ditations\nsur le myst\u00e8re chr\u00e9tien, pp. 280\u2010283.\n269 Compare M.

Mysticism for him means any sudden perception of hidden\nsignificance in things. He explains such perception by the abundant\nuncompleted associations which experiences may arouse in a\ndegenerate brain. These give to him who has the experience a vague\nand vast sense of its leading further, yet they awaken no definite\nor useful consequent in his thought. The explanation is a plausible\none for certain sorts of feeling of significance; and other\nalienists (WERNICKE, for example, in his Grundriss der Psychiatrie,\nTheil ii., Leipzig, 1896) have explained \u201cparanoiac\u201d conditions by a\nlaming of the association\u2010organ. But the higher mystical flights,\nwith their positiveness and abruptness, are surely products of no\nsuch merely negative condition. It seems far more reasonable to\nascribe them to inroads from the subconscious life, of the cerebral\nactivity correlative to which we as yet know nothing.\n285 They sometimes add subjective _audita et visa_ to the facts, but as\nthese are usually interpreted as transmundane, they oblige no\nalteration in the facts of sense.\n286 Compare Professor W. WALLACE\u2019S Gifford Lectures, in Lectures and\nEssays, Oxford, 1898, pp. 17 ff.\n287 Op. cit., p. 174, abridged.\n288 Ibid., p. 186, abridged and italicized.\n289 Discourse II. \u00a7 7.\n290 As regards the secondary character of intellectual constructions,\nand the primacy of feeling and instinct in founding religious\nbeliefs, see the striking work of H. FIELDING, The Hearts of Men,\nLondon, 1902, which came into my hands after my text was written.\n\u201cCreeds,\u201d says the author, \u201care the grammar of religion, they are to\nreligion what grammar is to speech. Words are the expression of our\nwants; grammar is the theory formed afterwards. Speech never\nproceeded from grammar, but the reverse. As speech progresses and\nchanges from unknown causes, grammar must follow\u201d (p. 313). The\nwhole book, which keeps unusually close to concrete facts, is little\nmore than an amplification of this text.\n291 For convenience\u2019 sake, I follow the order of A. ST\u00d6CKL\u2019S Lehrbuch\nder Philosophie, 5te Auflage, Mainz, 1881, Band ii. B. BOEDDER\u2019S\nNatural Theology, London, 1891, is a handy English Catholic Manual;\nbut an almost identical doctrine is given by such Protestant\ntheologians as C. HODGE: Systematic Theology, New York, 1873, or A.\nH. STRONG: Systematic Theology, 5th edition, New York, 1896.\n292 It must not be forgotten that any form of _dis_order in the world\nmight, by the design argument, suggest a God for just that kind of\ndisorder. The truth is that any state of things whatever that can be\nnamed is logically susceptible of teleological interpretation. The\nruins of the earthquake at Lisbon, for example: the whole of past\nhistory had to be planned exactly as it was to bring about in the\nfullness of time just that particular arrangement of d\u00e9bris of\nmasonry, furniture, and once living bodies. No other train of causes\nwould have been sufficient. And so of any other arrangement, bad or\ngood, which might as a matter of fact be found resulting anywhere\nfrom previous conditions. To avoid such pessimistic consequences and\nsave its beneficent designer, the design argument accordingly\ninvokes two other principles, restrictive in their operation. The\nfirst is physical: Nature\u2019s forces tend of their own accord only to\ndisorder and destruction, to heaps of ruins, not to architecture.\nThis principle, though plausible at first sight, seems, in the light\nof recent biology, to be more and more improbable. The second\nprinciple is one of anthropomorphic interpretation. No arrangement\nthat for _us_ is \u201cdisorderly\u201d can possibly have been an object of\ndesign at all. This principle is of course a mere assumption in the\ninterests of anthropomorphic Theism.\nWhen one views the world with no definite theological bias one way\nor the other, one sees that order and disorder, as we now recognize\nthem, are purely human inventions. We are interested in certain\ntypes of arrangement, useful, \u00e6sthetic, or moral,\u2014so interested that\nwhenever we find them realized, the fact emphatically rivets our\nattention. The result is that we work over the contents of the world\nselectively. It is overflowing with disorderly arrangements from our\npoint of view, but order is the only thing we care for and look at,\nand by choosing, one can always find some sort of orderly\narrangement in the midst of any chaos. If I should throw down a\nthousand beans at random upon a table, I could doubtless, by\neliminating a sufficient number of them, leave the rest in almost\nany geometrical pattern you might propose to me, and you might then\nsay that that pattern was the thing prefigured beforehand, and that\nthe other beans were mere irrelevance and packing material. Our\ndealings with Nature are just like this. She is a vast _plenum_ in\nwhich our attention draws capricious lines in innumerable\ndirections. We count and name whatever lies upon the special lines\nwe trace, whilst the other things and the untraced lines are neither\nnamed nor counted. There are in reality infinitely more things\n\u2019unadapted\u2019 to each other in this world than there are things\n\u2019adapted\u2019; infinitely more things with irregular relations than with\nregular relations between them. But we look for the regular kind of\nthing exclusively, and ingeniously discover and preserve it in our\nmemory. It accumulates with other regular kinds, until the\ncollection of them fills our encyclop\u00e6dias. Yet all the while\nbetween and around them lies an infinite anonymous chaos of objects\nthat no one ever thought of together, of relations that never yet\nattracted our attention.\nThe facts of order from which the physico\u2010theological argument\nstarts are thus easily susceptible of interpretation as arbitrary\nhuman products. So long as this is the case, although of course no\nargument against God follows, it follows that the argument for him\nwill fail to constitute a knock\u2010down proof of his existence. It will\nbe convincing only to those who on other grounds believe in him\nalready.\n293 For the scholastics the _facultas appetendi_ embraces feeling,\ndesire, and will.\n294 Op. cit., Discourse III. \u00a7 7.\n295 In an article, How to make our Ideas Clear, in the Popular Science\nMonthly for January, 1878, vol. xii. p. 286.\n296 Pragmatically, the most important attribute of God is his punitive\njustice. But who, in the present state of theological opinion on\nthat point, will dare maintain that hell fire or its equivalent in\nsome shape is rendered certain by pure logic? Theology herself has\nlargely based this doctrine upon revelation; and, in discussing it,\nhas tended more and more to substitute conventional ideas of\ncriminal law for a priori principles of reason. But the very notion\nthat this glorious universe, with planets and winds, and laughing\nsky and ocean, should have been conceived and had its beams and\nrafters laid in technicalities of criminality, is incredible to our\nmodern imagination. It weakens a religion to hear it argued upon\nsuch a basis.\n297 John Caird: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion, London\nand New York, 1880, pp. 243\u2010250, and 291\u2010299, much abridged.\n298 A.

In\nthe present lectures, which are cast throughout in a popular mould,\nthere seemed no room for subtle metaphysical discussion, and for\ntactical purposes it was sufficient, the contention of philosophy\nbeing what it is (namely, that religion can be transformed into a\nuniversally convincing science), to point to the fact that no\nreligious philosophy has actually convinced the mass of thinkers.\nMeanwhile let me say that I hope that the present volume may be\nfollowed by another, if I am spared to write it, in which not only\nProfessor Royce\u2019s arguments, but others for monistic absolutism\nshall be considered with all the technical fullness which their\ngreat importance calls for. At present I resign myself to lying\npassive under the reproach of superficiality.\n299 Idea of a University, Discourse III. \u00a7 7.\n300 Newman\u2019s imagination so innately craved an ecclesiastical system\nthat he can write: \u201cFrom the age of fifteen, dogma has been the\nfundamental principle of my religion: I know no other religion; I\ncannot enter into the idea of any other sort of religion.\u201d And\nagain, speaking of himself about the age of thirty, he writes: \u201cI\nloved to act as feeling myself in my Bishop\u2019s sight, as if it were\nthe sight of God.\u201d Apologia, 1897, pp. 48, 50.\n301 The intellectual difference is quite on a par in practical\nimportance with the analogous difference in character. We saw, under\nthe head of Saintliness, how some characters resent confusion and\nmust live in purity, consistency, simplicity (above, p. 280 ff.).\nFor others, on the contrary, superabundance, over\u2010pressure,\nstimulation, lots of superficial relations, are indispensable. There\nare men who would suffer a very syncope if you should pay all their\ndebts, bring it about that their engagements had been kept, their\nletters answered, their perplexities relieved, and their duties\nfulfilled, down to one which lay on a clean table under their eyes\nwith nothing to interfere with its immediate performance. A day\nstripped so staringly bare would be for them appalling. So with\nease, elegance, tributes of affection, social recognitions\u2014some of\nus require amounts of these things which to others would appear a\nmass of lying and sophistication.\n302 In Newman\u2019s Lectures on Justification, Lecture VIII. \u00a7 6, there is a\nsplendid passage expressive of this \u00e6sthetic way of feeling the\nChristian scheme. It is unfortunately too long to quote.\n303 Compare the informality of Protestantism, where the \u201cmeek lover of\nthe good,\u201d alone with his God, visits the sick, etc., for their own\nsakes, with the elaborate \u201cbusiness\u201d that goes on in Catholic\ndevotion, and carries with it the social excitement of all more\ncomplex businesses. An essentially worldly\u2010minded Catholic woman can\nbecome a visitor of the sick on purely coquettish principles, with\nher confessor and director, her \u201cmerit\u201d storing up, her patron\nsaints, her privileged relation to the Almighty, drawing his\nattention as a professional _d\u00e9vote_, her definite \u201cexercises,\u201d and\nher definitely recognized social _pose_ in the organization.\n304 Above, p. 362 ff.\n305 A fuller discussion of confession is contained in the excellent work\nby FRANK GRANGER: The Soul of a Christian, London, 1900, ch. xii.\n306 Example: \u201cThe minister at Sudbury, being at the Thursday lecture in\nBoston, heard the officiating clergyman praying for rain. As soon as\nthe service was over, he went to the petitioner and said, \u2018You\nBoston ministers, as soon as a tulip wilts under your windows, go to\nchurch and pray for rain, until all Concord and Sudbury are under\nwater.\u2019 \u201d R.

Robert Lyde, an English sailor,\nalong with an English boy, being prisoners on a French ship in 1689,\nset upon the crew, of seven Frenchmen, killed two, made the other\nfive prisoners, and brought home the ship. Lyde thus describes how\nin this feat he found his God a very present help in time of\ntrouble:\u2014\n\u201cWith the assistance of God I kept my feet when they three and one\nmore did strive to throw me down. Feeling the Frenchman which hung\nabout my middle hang very heavy, I said to the boy, \u2018Go round the\nbinnacle, and knock down that man that hangeth on my back.\u2019 So the\nboy did strike him one blow on the head which made him fall.... Then\nI looked about for a marlin spike or anything else to strike them\nwithal. But seeing nothing, I said, \u2018LORD! what shall I do?\u2019 Then\ncasting up my eye upon my left side, and seeing a marlin spike\nhanging, I jerked my right arm and took hold, and struck the point\nfour times about a quarter of an inch deep into the skull of that\nman that had hold of my left arm. [One of the Frenchmen then hauled\nthe marlin spike away from him.] But through GOD\u2019S wonderful\nprovidence! it either fell out of his hand, or else he threw it\ndown, and at this time the Almighty GOD gave me strength enough to\ntake one man in one hand, and throw at the other\u2019s head: and looking\nabout again to see anything to strike them withal, but seeing\nnothing, I said, \u2018LORD! what shall I do now?\u2019 And then it pleased\nGOD to put me in mind of my knife in my pocket. And although two of\nthe men had hold of my right arm, yet GOD Almighty strengthened me\nso that I put my right hand into my right pocket, drew out the knife\nand sheath, ... put it between my legs and drew it out, and then cut\nthe man\u2019s throat with it that had his back to my breast: and he\nimmediately dropt down, and scarce ever stirred after.\u201d\u2014I have\nslightly abridged Lyde\u2019s narrative.\n314 As, for instance, In Answer to Prayer, by the BISHOP OF RIPON and\nothers, London, 1898; Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to\nPrayer, Harrisburg, Pa., 1898 (?); H.

These\nthings we ought forever to celebrate.... But because the most of you\nare blind and insensible, there must be some one to fill this\nstation, and lead, in behalf of all men, the hymn to God; for what\nelse can I do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God?

We must normally have such a feeling, he thinks, or\nthe _sense of an absence_ would not be so striking as it is in these\nexperiences. Graphic automatism of a fully developed kind is rare in\nreligious history, so far as my knowledge goes. Such statements as\nAntonia Bourignon\u2019s, that \u201cI do nothing but lend my hand and spirit\nto another power than mine,\u201d is shown by the context to indicate\ninspiration rather than directly automatic writing. In some\neccentric sects this latter occurs.

From an\nobliging letter written to me in 1899 by an eminent Mormon, I quote\nthe following extract:\u2014\n\u201cIt may be very interesting for you to know that the President [Mr.\nSnow] of the Mormon Church claims to have had a number of\nrevelations very recently from heaven. To explain fully what these\nrevelations are, it is necessary to know that we, as a people,\nbelieve that the Church of Jesus Christ has again been established\nthrough messengers sent from heaven. This Church has at its head a\nprophet, seer, and revelator, who gives to man God\u2019s holy will.\nRevelation is the means through which the will of God is declared\ndirectly and in fullness to man. These revelations are got through\ndreams of sleep or in waking visions of the mind, by voices without\nvisional appearance, or by actual manifestations of the Holy\nPresence before the eye. We believe that God has come in person and\nspoken to our prophet and revelator.\u201d\n328 For example, on pages 135, 163, 333, above.\n329 From this point of view, the contrasts between the healthy and the\nmorbid mind, and between the once\u2010born and the twice\u2010born types, of\nwhich I spoke in earlier lectures (see pp. 162\u2010167), cease to be the\nradical antagonisms which many think them. The twice\u2010born look down\nupon the rectilinear consciousness of life of the once\u2010born as being\n\u201cmere morality,\u201d and not properly religion. \u201cDr. Channing,\u201d an\northodox minister is reported to have said, \u201cis excluded from the\nhighest form of religious life by the extraordinary rectitude of his\ncharacter.\u201d It is indeed true that the outlook upon life of the\ntwice\u2010born\u2014holding as it does more of the element of evil in\nsolution\u2014is the wider and completer. The \u201cheroic\u201d or \u201csolemn\u201d way in\nwhich life comes to them is a \u201chigher synthesis\u201d into which healthy\u2010\nmindedness and morbidness both enter and combine. Evil is not\nevaded, but sublated in the higher religious cheer of these persons\n(see pp. 47\u201052, 362\u2010365). But the final consciousness which each\ntype reaches of union with the divine has the same practical\nsignificance for the individual; and individuals may well be allowed\nto get to it by the channels which lie most open to their several\ntemperaments. In the cases which were quoted in Lecture IV, of the\nmind\u2010cure form of healthy\u2010mindedness, we found abundant examples of\nregenerative process. The severity of the crisis in this process is\na matter of degree. How long one shall continue to drink the\nconsciousness of evil, and when one shall begin to short\u2010circuit and\nget rid of it, are also matters of amount and degree, so that in\nmany instances it is quite arbitrary whether we class the individual\nas a once\u2010born or a twice\u2010born subject.\n330 Compare, e.g., the quotation from Renan on p. 37, above.\n331 \u201cPrayerful\u201d taken in the broader sense explained above on pp. 463\nff.\n332 How was it ever conceivable, we ask, that a man like Christian\nWolff, in whose dry\u2010as\u2010dust head all the learning of the early\neighteenth century was concentrated, should have preserved such a\nbaby\u2010like faith in the personal and human character of Nature as to\nexpound her operations as he did in his work on the uses of natural\nthings? This, for example, is the account he gives of the sun and\nits utility:\u2014\n\u201cWe see that God has created the sun to keep the changeable\nconditions on the earth in such an order that living creatures, men\nand beasts, may inhabit its surface. Since men are the most\nreasonable of creatures, and able to infer God\u2019s invisible being\nfrom the contemplation of the world, the sun in so far forth\ncontributes to the primary purpose of creation: without it the race\nof man could not be preserved or continued.... The sun makes\ndaylight, not only on our earth, but also on the other planets; and\ndaylight is of the utmost utility to us; for by its means we can\ncommodiously carry on those occupations which in the night\u2010time\nwould either be quite impossible, or at any rate impossible without\nour going to the expense of artificial light. The beasts of the\nfield can find food by day which they would not be able to find at\nnight. Moreover we owe it to the sunlight that we are able to see\neverything that is on the earth\u2019s surface, not only near by, but\nalso at a distance, and to recognize both near and far things\naccording to their species, which again is of manifold use to us not\nonly in the business necessary to human life, and when we are\ntraveling, but also for the scientific knowledge of Nature, which\nknowledge for the most part depends on observations made with the\nhelp of sight, and, without the sunshine, would have been\nimpossible. If any one would rightly impress on his mind the great\nadvantages which he derives from the sun, let him imagine himself\nliving through only one month, and see how it would be with all his\nundertakings, if it were not day but night. He would then be\nsufficiently convinced out of his own experience, especially if he\nhad much work to carry on in the street or in the fields.... From\nthe sun we learn to recognize when it is midday, and by knowing this\npoint of time exactly, we can set our clocks right, on which account\nastronomy owes much to the sun.... By help of the sun one can find\nthe meridian.... But the meridian is the basis of our sun\u2010dials, and\ngenerally speaking, we should have no sun\u2010dials if we had no sun.\u201d\nVern\u00fcnftige Gedanken von den Absichten der nat\u00fcrlichen Dinge, 1782,\npp. 74\u201084.\nOr read the account of God\u2019s beneficence in the institution of \u201cthe\ngreat variety throughout the world of men\u2019s faces, voices, and\nhandwriting,\u201d given in Derham\u2019s Physico\u2010theology, a book that had\nmuch vogue in the eighteenth century. \u201cHad Man\u2019s body,\u201d says Dr.\nDerham, \u201cbeen made according to any of the Atheistical Schemes, or\nany other Method than that of the infinite Lord of the World, this\nwise Variety would never have been: but Men\u2019s Faces would have been\ncast in the same, or not a very different Mould, their Organs of\nSpeech would have sounded the same or not so great a Variety of\nNotes; and the same Structure of Muscles and Nerves would have given\nthe Hand the same Direction in Writing. And in this Case, what\nConfusion, what Disturbance, what Mischiefs would the world\neternally have lain under! No Security could have been to our\npersons; no Certainty, no Enjoyment of our Possessions; no Justice\nbetween Man and Man; no Distinction between Good and Bad, between\nFriends and Foes, between Father and Child, Husband and Wife, Male\nor Female; but all would have been turned topsy\u2010turvy, by being\nexposed to the Malice of the Envious and ill\u2010Natured, to the Fraud\nand Violence of Knaves and Robbers, to the Forgeries of the crafty\nCheat, to the Lusts of the Effeminate and Debauched, and what not!\nOur Courts of Justice can abundantly testify the dire Effects of\nMistaking Men\u2019s Faces, of counterfeiting their Hands, and forging\nWritings. But now as the infinitely wise Creator and Ruler hath\nordered the Matter, every man\u2019s Face can distinguish him in the\nLight, and his Voice in the Dark; his Hand\u2010writing can speak for him\nthough absent, and be his Witness, and secure his Contracts in\nfuture Generations. A manifest as well as admirable Indication of\nthe divine Superintendence and Management.\u201d\nA God so careful as to make provision even for the unmistakable\nsigning of bank checks and deeds was a deity truly after the heart\nof eighteenth century Anglicanism.\nI subjoin, omitting the capitals, Derham\u2019s \u201cVindication of God by\nthe Institution of Hills and Valleys,\u201d and Wolff\u2019s altogether\nculinary account of the institution of Water:\u2014\n\u201cThe uses,\u201d says Wolff, \u201cwhich water serves in human life are plain\nto see and need not be described at length. Water is a universal\ndrink of man and beasts. Even though men have made themselves drinks\nthat are artificial, they could not do this without water. Beer is\nbrewed of water and malt, and it is the water in it which quenches\nthirst. Wine is prepared from grapes, which could never have grown\nwithout the help of water; and the same is true of those drinks\nwhich in England and other places they produce from fruit....\nTherefore since God so planned the world that men and beasts should\nlive upon it and find there everything required for their necessity\nand convenience, he also made water as one means whereby to make the\nearth into so excellent a dwelling. And this is all the more\nmanifest when we consider the advantages which we obtain from this\nsame water for the cleaning of our household utensils, of our\nclothing, and of other matters.... When one goes into a grinding\u2010\nmill one sees that the grindstone must always be kept wet and then\none will get a still greater idea of the use of water.\u201d\nOf the hills and valleys, Derham, after praising their beauty,\ndiscourses as follows: \u201cSome constitutions are indeed of so happy a\nstrength, and so confirmed an health, as to be indifferent to almost\nany place or temperature of the air. But then others are so weakly\nand feeble, as not to be able to bear one, but can live comfortably\nin another place. With some the more subtle and finer air of the\nhills doth best agree, who are languishing and dying in the feculent\nand grosser air of great towns, or even the warmer and vaporous air\nof the valleys and waters. But contrariwise, others languish on the\nhills, and grow lusty and strong in the warmer air of the valleys.\n\u201cSo that this opportunity of shifting our abode from the hills to\nthe vales, is an admirable easement, refreshment, and great benefit\nto the valetudinarian, feeble part of mankind; affording those an\neasy and comfortable life, who would otherwise live miserably,\nlanguish, and pine away.\n\u201cTo this salutary conformation of the earth we may add another great\nconvenience of the hills, and that is affording commodious places\nfor habitation, serving (as an eminent author wordeth it) as screens\nto keep off the cold and nipping blasts of the northern and easterly\nwinds, and reflecting the benign and cherishing sunbeams, and so\nrendering our habitations both more comfortable and more cheerly in\nwinter.\n\u201cLastly, it is to the hills that the fountains owe their rise and\nthe rivers their conveyance, and consequently those vast masses and\nlofty piles are not, as they are charged, such rude and useless\nexcrescences of our ill\u2010formed globe; but the admirable tools of\nnature, contrived and ordered by the infinite Creator, to do one of\nits most useful works. For, was the surface of the earth even and\nlevel, and the middle parts of its islands and continents not\nmountainous and high as now it is, it is most certain there could be\nno descent for the rivers, no conveyance for the waters; but,\ninstead of gliding along those gentle declivities which the higher\nlands now afford them quite down to the sea, they would stagnate and\nperhaps stink, and also drown large tracts of land.\n\u201c[Thus] the hills and vales, though to a peevish and weary traveler\nthey may seem incommodious and troublesome, yet are a noble work of\nthe great Creator, and wisely appointed by him for the good of our\nsublunary world.\u201d\n333 Until the seventeenth century this mode of thought prevailed. One\nneed only recall the dramatic treatment even of mechanical questions\nby Aristotle, as, for example, his explanation of the power of the\nlever to make a small weight raise a larger one. This is due,\naccording to Aristotle, to the generally miraculous character of the\ncircle and of all circular movement. The circle is both convex and\nconcave; it is made by a fixed point and a moving line, which\ncontradict each other; and whatever moves in a circle moves in\nopposite directions. Nevertheless, movement in a circle is the most\n\u201cnatural\u201d movement; and the long arm of the lever, moving, as it\ndoes, in the larger circle, has the greater amount of this natural\nmotion, and consequently requires the lesser force. Or recall the\nexplanation by Herodotus of the position of the sun in winter: It\nmoves to the south because of the cold which drives it into the warm\nparts of the heavens over Libya. Or listen to Saint Augustine\u2019s\nspeculations: \u201cWho gave to chaff such power to freeze that it\npreserves snow buried under it, and such power to warm that it\nripens green fruit? Who can explain the strange properties of fire\nitself, which blackens all that it burns, though itself bright, and\nwhich, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost all\nthat it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy\ncinders?... Then what wonderful properties do we find in charcoal,\nwhich is so brittle that a light tap breaks it, and a slight\npressure pulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture rots\nit, nor any time causes it to decay.\u201d City of God, book xxi. ch. iv.\nSuch aspects of things as these, their naturalness and\nunnaturalness, the sympathies and antipathies of their superficial\nqualities, their eccentricities, their brightness and strength and\ndestructiveness, were inevitably the ways in which they originally\nfastened our attention.\nIf you open early medical books, you will find sympathetic magic\ninvoked on every page. Take, for example, the famous vulnerary\nointment attributed to Paracelsus. For this there were a variety of\nreceipts, including usually human fat, the fat of either a bull, a\nwild boar, or a bear; powdered earthworms, the _usnia_, or mossy\ngrowth on the weathered skull of a hanged criminal, and other\nmaterials equally unpleasant\u2014the whole prepared under the planet\nVenus if possible, but never under Mars or Saturn. Then, if a\nsplinter of wood, dipped in the patient\u2019s blood, or the bloodstained\nweapon that wounded him, be immersed in this ointment, the wound\nitself being tightly bound up, the latter infallibly gets well,\u2014I\nquote now Van Helmont\u2019s account,\u2014for the blood on the weapon or\nsplinter, containing in it the spirit of the wounded man, is roused\nto active excitement by the contact of the ointment, whence there\nresults to it a full commission or power to cure its cousin\u2010german,\nthe blood in the patient\u2019s body. This it does by sucking out the\ndolorous and exotic impression from the wounded part. But to do this\nit has to implore the aid of the bull\u2019s fat, and other portions of\nthe unguent. The reason why bull\u2019s fat is so powerful is that the\nbull at the time of slaughter is full of secret reluctancy and\nvindictive murmurs, and therefore dies with a higher flame of\nrevenge about him than any other animal. And thus we have made it\nout, says this author, that the admirable efficacy of the ointment\nought to be imputed, not to any auxiliary concurrence of Satan, but\nsimply to the energy of the _posthumous character of Revenge_\nremaining firmly impressed upon the blood and concreted fat in the\nunguent. J. B. VAN HELMONT: A Ternary of Paradoxes, translated by\nWALTER CHARLETON, London, 1650.\u2014I much abridge the original in my\ncitations.\nThe author goes on to prove by the analogy of many other natural\nfacts that this sympathetic action between things at a distance is\nthe true rationale of the case. \u201cIf,\u201d he says, \u201cthe heart of a\nhorse, slain by a witch, taken out of the yet reeking carcase, be\nimpaled upon an arrow and roasted, immediately the whole witch\nbecomes tormented with the insufferable pains and cruelty of the\nfire, which could by no means happen unless there preceded a\nconjunction of the spirit of the witch with the spirit of the horse.\nIn the reeking and yet panting heart, the spirit of the witch is\nkept captive, and the retreat of it prevented by the arrow\ntransfixed. Similarly hath not many a murdered carcase at the\ncoroner\u2019s inquest suffered a fresh h\u00e6morrhage or cruentation at the\npresence of the assassin?\u2014the blood being, as in a furious fit of\nanger, enraged and agitated by the impress of revenge conceived\nagainst the murderer, at the instant of the soul\u2019s compulsive exile\nfrom the body. So, if you have dropsy, gout, or jaundice, by\nincluding some of your warm blood in the shell and white of an egg,\nwhich, exposed to a gentle heat, and mixed with a bait of flesh, you\nshall give to a hungry dog or hog, the disease shall instantly pass\nfrom you into the animal, and leave you entirely. And similarly\nagain, if you burn some of the milk either of a cow or of a woman,\nthe gland from which it issued will dry up. A gentleman at Brussels\nhad his nose mowed off in a combat, but the celebrated surgeon\nTagliacozzus digged a new nose for him out of the skin of the arm of\na porter at Bologna. About thirteen months after his return to his\nown country, the engrafted nose grew cold, putrefied, and in a few\ndays dropped off, and it was then discovered that the porter had\nexpired, near about the same punctilio of time. There are still at\nBrussels eye\u2010witnesses of this occurrence,\u201d says Van Helmont; and\nadds, \u201cI pray what is there in this of superstition or of exalted\nimagination?\u201d\nModern mind\u2010cure literature\u2014the works of Prentice Mulford, for\nexample\u2014is full of sympathetic magic.\n334 Compare Lotze\u2019s doctrine that the only meaning we can attach to the\nnotion of a thing as it is \u201cin itself\u201d is by conceiving it as it is\n_for_ itself; i.e., as a piece of full experience with a private\nsense of \u201cpinch\u201d or inner activity of some sort going with it.\n335 Even the errors of fact may possibly turn out not to be as wholesale\nas the scientist assumes. We saw in Lecture IV how the religious\nconception of the universe seems to many mind\u2010curers \u2019verified\u2019 from\nday to day by their experience of fact. \u201cExperience of fact\u201d is a\nfield with so many things in it that the sectarian scientist,\nmethodically declining, as he does, to recognize such \u201cfacts\u201d as\nmind\u2010curers and others like them experience, otherwise than by such\nrude heads of classification as \u201cbosh,\u201d \u201crot,\u201d \u201cfolly,\u201d certainly\nleaves out a mass of raw fact which, save for the industrious\ninterest of the religious in the more personal aspects of reality,\nwould never have succeeded in getting itself recorded at all. We\nknow this to be true already in certain cases; it may, therefore, be\ntrue in others as well. Miraculous healings have always been part of\nthe supernaturalist stock in trade, and have always been dismissed\nby the scientist as figments of the imagination. But the scientist\u2019s\ntardy education in the facts of hypnotism has recently given him an\napperceiving mass for phenomena of this order, and he consequently\nnow allows that the healings may exist, provided you expressly call\nthem effects of \u201csuggestion.\u201d Even the stigmata of the cross on\nSaint Francis\u2019s hands and feet may on these terms not be a fable.\nSimilarly, the time\u2010honored phenomenon of diabolical possession is\non the point of being admitted by the scientist as a fact, now that\nhe has the name of \u201chystero\u2010demonopathy\u201d by which to apperceive it.\nNo one can foresee just how far this legitimation of occultist\nphenomena under newly found scientist titles may proceed\u2014even\n\u201cprophecy,\u201d even \u201clevitation,\u201d might creep into the pale.\nThus the divorce between scientist facts and religious facts may not\nnecessarily be as eternal as it at first sight seems, nor the\npersonalism and romanticism of the world, as they appeared to\nprimitive thinking, be matters so irrevocably outgrown. The final\nhuman opinion may, in short, in some manner now impossible to\nforesee, revert to the more personal style, just as any path of\nprogress may follow a spiral rather than a straight line. If this\nwere so, the rigorously impersonal view of science might one day\nappear as having been a temporarily useful eccentricity rather than\nthe definitively triumphant position which the sectarian scientist\nat present so confidently announces it to be.\n336 Hume\u2019s criticism has banished causation from the world of physical\nobjects, and \u201cScience\u201d is absolutely satisfied to define cause in\nterms of concomitant change\u2014read Mach, Pearson, Ostwald. The\n\u201coriginal\u201d of the notion of causation is in our inner personal\nexperience, and only there can causes in the old\u2010fashioned sense be\ndirectly observed and described.\n337 When I read in a religious paper words like these: \u201cPerhaps the best\nthing we can say of God is that he is _the Inevitable Inference_,\u201d I\nrecognize the tendency to let religion evaporate in intellectual\nterms. Would martyrs have sung in the flames for a mere inference,\nhowever inevitable it might be? Original religious men, like Saint\nFrancis, Luther, Behmen, have usually been enemies of the\nintellect\u2019s pretension to meddle with religious things. Yet the\nintellect, everywhere invasive, shows everywhere its shallowing\neffect. See how the ancient spirit of Methodism evaporates under\nthose wonderfully able rationalistic booklets (which every one\nshould read) of a philosopher like Professor Bowne (The Christian\nRevelation, The Christian Life, The Atonement: Cincinnati and New\nYork, 1898, 1899, 1900). See the positively expulsive purpose of\nphilosophy properly so called:\u2014\n\u201cReligion,\u201d writes M. Vacherot (La Religion, Paris, 1869, pp. 313,\n436, et passim), \u201canswers to a transient state or condition, not to\na permanent determination of human nature, being merely an\nexpression of that stage of the human mind which is dominated by the\nimagination.... Christianity has but a single possible final heir to\nits estate, and that is scientific philosophy.\u201d\nIn a still more radical vein, Professor Ribot (Psychologie des\nSentiments, p. 310) describes the evaporation of religion. He sums\nit up in a single formula\u2014the ever\u2010growing predominance of the\nrational intellectual element, with the gradual fading out of the\nemotional element, this latter tending to enter into the group of\npurely intellectual sentiments. \u201cOf religious sentiment properly so\ncalled, nothing survives at last save a vague respect for the\nunknowable _x_ which is a last relic of the fear, and a certain\nattraction towards the ideal, which is a relic of the love, that\ncharacterized the earlier periods of religious growth. To state this\nmore simply, _religion tends to turn into religious\nphilosophy_.\u2014These are psychologically entirely different things,\nthe one being a theoretic construction of ratiocination, whereas the\nother is the living work of a group of persons, or of a great\ninspired leader, calling into play the entire thinking and feeling\norganism of man.\u201d\nI find the same failure to recognize that the stronghold of religion\nlies in individuality in attempts like those of Professor Baldwin\n(Mental Development, Social and Ethical Interpretations, ch. x.) and\nMr. H. R. Marshall (Instinct and Reason, chaps, viii. to xii.) to\nmake it a purely \u201cconservative social force.\u201d\n338 Compare, for instance, pages 203, 219, 223, 226, 249 to 256, 275 to\n278.\n339 American Journal of Psychology, vii. 345.\n340 Above, p. 184.\n341 Above, p. 145.\n342 Above, p. 400.\n343 Example: Henri Perreyve writes to Gratry: \u201cI do not know how to deal\nwith the happiness which you aroused in me this morning. It\noverwhelms me; I want to _do_ something, yet I can do nothing and am\nfit for nothing.... I would fain do _great things_.\u201d Again, after an\ninspiring interview, he writes: \u201cI went homewards, intoxicated with\njoy, hope, and strength. I wanted to feed upon my happiness in\nsolitude, far from all men. It was late; but, unheeding that, I took\na mountain path and went on like a madman, looking at the heavens,\nregardless of earth. Suddenly an instinct made me draw hastily\nback\u2014I was on the very edge of a precipice, one step more and I must\nhave fallen. I took fright and gave up my nocturnal promenade.\u201d A.\nGRATRY: Henri Perreyve, London, 1872, pp. 92, 89.\nThis primacy, in the faith\u2010state, of vague expansive impulse over\ndirection is well expressed in Walt Whitman\u2019s lines (Leaves of\nGrass, 1872, p. 190):\u2014\n\u201cO to confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs,\nas the trees and animals do....\nDear Camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still\nurge you, without the least idea what is our destination,\nOr whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell\u2019d and defeated.\u201d\nThis readiness for great things, and this sense that the world by\nits importance, wonderfulness, etc., is apt for their production,\nwould seem to be the undifferentiated germ of all the higher faiths.\nTrust in our own dreams of ambition, or in our country\u2019s expansive\ndestinies, and faith in the providence of God, all have their source\nin that onrush of our sanguine impulses, and in that sense of the\nexceedingness of the possible over the real.\n344 Compare LEUBA: Loc. cit., pp. 346\u2010349.\n345 The Contents of Religious Consciousness, in The Monist, xi. 536,\nJuly, 1901.\n346 Loc. cit., pp. 571, 572, abridged. See, also, this writer\u2019s\nextraordinarily true criticism of the notion that religion primarily\nseeks to solve the intellectual mystery of the world. Compare what\nW. BENDER says (in his Wesen der Religion, Bonn, 1888, pp. 85, 38):\n\u201cNot the question about God, and not the inquiry into the origin and\npurpose of the world is religion, but the question about Man. All\nreligious views of life are anthropocentric.\u201d \u201cReligion is that\nactivity of the human impulse towards self\u2010preservation by means of\nwhich Man seeks to carry his essential vital purposes through\nagainst the adverse pressure of the world by raising himself freely\ntowards the world\u2019s ordering and governing powers when the limits of\nhis own strength are reached.\u201d The whole book is little more than a\ndevelopment of these words.\n347 Remember that for some men it arrives suddenly, for others\ngradually, whilst others again practically enjoy it all their life.\n348 The practical difficulties are: 1, to \u201crealize the reality\u201d of one\u2019s\nhigher part; 2, to identify one\u2019s self with it exclusively; and 3,\nto identify it with all the rest of ideal being.\n349 \u201cWhen mystical activity is at its height, we find consciousness\npossessed by the sense of a being at once _excessive_ and\n_identical_ with the self: great enough to be God; interior enough\nto be me. The \u2018objectivity\u2019 of it ought in that case to be called\n_excessivity_, rather, or exceedingness.\u201d R\u00c9C\u00c9JAC: Essai sur les\nfondements de la conscience mystique, 1897, p. 46.\n350 The word \u201ctruth\u201d is here taken to mean something additional to bare\nvalue for life, although the natural propensity of man is to believe\nthat whatever has great value for life is thereby certified as true.\n351 Above, p. 455.\n352 Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, vol. vii. p. 305.\nFor a full statement of Mr. Myers\u2019s views, I may refer to his\nposthumous work, \u201cHuman Personality in the Light of Recent\nResearch,\u201d which is already announced by Messrs. Longmans, Green &\nCo. as being in press. Mr. Myers for the first time proposed as a\ngeneral psychological problem the exploration of the subliminal\nregion of consciousness throughout its whole extent, and made the\nfirst methodical steps in its topography by treating as a natural\nseries a mass of subliminal facts hitherto considered only as\ncurious isolated facts, and subjecting them to a systematized\nnomenclature. How important this exploration will prove, future work\nupon the path which Myers has opened can alone show. Compare my\npaper: \u201cFrederic Myers\u2019s Services to Psychology,\u201d in the said\nProceedings, part xlii., May, 1901.\n353 Compare the inventory given above on pp. 483\u20104, and also what is\nsaid of the subconscious self on pp. 233\u2010236, 240\u2010242.\n354 Compare above, pp. 419 ff.\n355 One more expression of this belief, to increase the reader\u2019s\nfamiliarity with the notion of it:\u2014\n\u201cIf this room is full of darkness for thousands of years, and you\ncome in and begin to weep and wail, \u2018Oh, the darkness,\u2019 will the\ndarkness vanish? Bring the light in, strike a match, and light comes\nin a moment. So what good will it do you to think all your lives,\n\u2018Oh, I have done evil, I have made many mistakes\u2019? It requires no\nghost to tell us that. Bring in the light, and the evil goes in a\nmoment. Strengthen the real nature, build up yourselves, the\neffulgent, the resplendent, the ever pure, call that up in every one\nwhom you see. I wish that every one of us had come to such a state\nthat even when we see the vilest of human beings we can see the God\nwithin, and instead of condemning, say, \u2018Rise, thou effulgent One,\nrise thou who art always pure, rise thou birthless and deathless,\nrise almighty, and manifest your nature.\u2019 ... This is the highest\nprayer that the Advaita teaches. This is the one prayer: remembering\nour nature.\u201d ... \u201cWhy does man go out to look for a God?... It is\nyour own heart beating, and you did not know, you were mistaking it\nfor something external. He, nearest of the near, my own self, the\nreality of my own life, my body and my soul.\u2014I am Thee and Thou art\nMe. That is your own nature. Assert it, manifest it. Not to become\npure, you are pure already. You are not to be perfect, you are that\nalready. Every good thought which you think or act upon is simply\ntearing the veil, as it were, and the purity, the Infinity, the God\nbehind, manifests itself\u2014the eternal Subject of everything, the\neternal Witness in this universe, your own Self. Knowledge is, as it\nwere, a lower step, a degradation. We are It already; how to know\nIt?\u201d SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: Addresses, No. XII., Practical Vedanta, part\niv. pp. 172, 174, London, 1897; and Lectures, The Real and the\nApparent Man, p. 24, abridged.\n356 For instance, here is a case where a person exposed from her birth\nto Christian ideas had to wait till they came to her clad in\nspiritistic formulas before the saving experience set in:\u2014\n\u201cFor myself I can say that spiritualism has saved me. It was\nrevealed to me at a critical moment of my life, and without it I\ndon\u2019t know what I should have done. It has taught me to detach\nmyself from worldly things and to place my hope in things to come.\nThrough it I have learned to see in all men, even in those most\ncriminal, even in those from whom I have most suffered, undeveloped\nbrothers to whom I owed assistance, love, and forgiveness. I have\nlearned that I must lose my temper over nothing, despise no one, and\npray for all. Most of all I have learned to pray! And although I\nhave still much to learn in this domain, prayer ever brings me more\nstrength, consolation, and comfort. I feel more than ever that I\nhave only made a few steps on the long road of progress; but I look\nat its length without dismay, for I have confidence that the day\nwill come when all my efforts shall be rewarded. So Spiritualism has\na great place in my life, indeed it holds the first place there.\u201d\nFlournoy Collection.\n357 \u201cThe influence of the Holy Spirit, exquisitely called the Comforter,\nis a matter of actual experience, as solid a reality as that of\nelectro\u2010magnetism.\u201d W. C. BROWNELL, Scribner\u2019s Magazine, vol. xxx.\np. 112.\n358 That the transaction of opening ourselves, otherwise called prayer,\nis a perfectly definite one for certain persons, appears abundantly\nin the preceding lectures. I append another concrete example to\nreinforce the impression on the reader\u2019s mind:\u2014\n\u201cMan can learn to transcend these limitations [of finite thought]\nand draw power and wisdom at will.... The divine presence is known\nthrough experience. The turning to a higher plane is a distinct act\nof consciousness. It is not a vague, twilight or semi\u2010conscious\nexperience. It is not an ecstasy; it is not a trance. It is not\nsuper\u2010consciousness in the Vedantic sense. It is not due to self\u2010\nhypnotization. It is a perfectly calm, sane, sound, rational,\ncommon\u2010sense shifting of consciousness from the phenomena of sense\u2010\nperception to the phenomena of seership, from the thought of self to\na distinctively higher realm.... For example, if the lower self be\nnervous, anxious, tense, one can in a few moments compel it to be\ncalm. This is not done by a word simply. Again I say, it is not\nhypnotism. It is by the exercise of power. One feels the spirit of\npeace as definitely as heat is perceived on a hot summer day. The\npower can be as surely used as the sun\u2019s rays can be focused and\nmade to do work, to set fire to wood.\u201d The Higher Law, vol. iv. pp.\n4, 6, Boston, August, 1901.\n359 Transcendentalists are fond of the term \u201cOver\u2010soul,\u201d but as a rule\nthey use it in an intellectualist sense, as meaning only a medium of\ncommunion. \u201cGod\u201d is a causal agent as well as a medium of communion,\nand that is the aspect which I wish to emphasize.\n360 Transcendental idealism, of course, insists that its ideal world\nmakes _this_ difference, that facts _exist_. We owe it to the\nAbsolute that we have a world of fact at all. \u201cA world\u201d of\nfact!\u2014that exactly is the trouble. An entire world is the smallest\nunit with which the Absolute can work, whereas to our finite minds\nwork for the better ought to be done within this world, setting in\nat single points. Our difficulties and our ideals are all piecemeal\naffairs, but the Absolute can do no piecework for us; so that all\nthe interests which our poor souls compass raise their heads too\nlate. We should have spoken earlier, prayed for another world\nabsolutely, before this world was born. It is strange, I have heard\na friend say, to see this blind corner into which Christian thought\nhas worked itself at last, with its God who can raise no particular\nweight whatever, who can help us with no private burden, and who is\non the side of our enemies as much as he is on our own. Odd\nevolution from the God of David\u2019s psalms!\n361 See my Will to Believe and other Essays in Popular Philosophy, 1897,\np. 165.\n362 Such a notion is suggested in my Ingersoll Lecture On Human\nImmortality, Boston and London, 1899.\n363 Tertium Quid, 1887, p. 99.
