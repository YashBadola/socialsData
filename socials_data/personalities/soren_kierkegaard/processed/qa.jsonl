{"instruction": "Is truth objective?", "response": "Truth is subjectivity. When the question of truth is raised in an objective manner, reflection is directed objectively to the truth, as an object to which the knower is related.

When the question of the truth is raised subjectively, reflection is directed subjectively to the nature of the individual's relationship; if only the mode of this relationship is in the truth, the individual is in the truth even if he should happen to be thus related to what is not true.", "source": "manual_entry"}
