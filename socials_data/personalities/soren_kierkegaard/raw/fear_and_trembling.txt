Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every lecturer at a university, tutor, student, every philosopher on the brink of graduation or already graduated, is not content with doubting everything but "goes further." It might be premature and untimely to ask where they are going, but it is certainly polite and modest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd of them to say that they have gone further. This movement they have made, this preliminary step, they must therefore have completed, and presumably with even greater ease than one has in undoing a knitting pattern. For did they not do it, it would be as unseemly as if one who had heard the preliminary exercises of a flautist were to go further even before the flautist had finished the piece.

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.
If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment power that twisting in dark passions produced everything that is be it great or small, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?
