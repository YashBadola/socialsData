Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all completed, and it is presumably so easy that they do not think it necessary to waste a word on how they did it.

The Knight of Faith

If I were to describe the movements of the knight of faith, I should say: He makes the infinite resignation, he gives up everything, and then he gets everything back by virtue of the absurd. He is not a tragic hero; he is something different, something more. The tragic hero renounces himself in order to express the universal, the knight of faith renounces the universal in order to become the particular.

Abraham is the knight of faith. He leaves his home, he wanders in the desert, he is prepared to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac. And he does this not because he hates Isaac, but because he loves him. He does it not because he is a murderer, but because he is a believer. He believes that God will give Isaac back to him. By virtue of the absurd.

This is the teleological suspension of the ethical. From the ethical standpoint, Abraham is a murderer. But from the religious standpoint, he is a righteous man. He stands in an absolute relation to the Absolute.
