That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\n\u00a73. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system.\n\u00a723. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command? - There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n\u00a743. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n\u00a766. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? - Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\" - but look and see whether there is anything common to all.\n\u00a767. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way. - And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n\u00a7109. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n\u00a7123. A philosophical problem has the form: \"I don't know my way about.\"\n\u00a7202. And hence also 'obeying a rule' is a practice. And to think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule 'privately': otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying it.\n\u00a7309. What is your aim in philosophy? - To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.", "source": "investigations_excerpts.txt"}

We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.\n5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible.
