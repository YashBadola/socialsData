The Sickness Unto Death
A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

By Anti-Climacus
Edited by S. Kierkegaard

Preface

To many the form of this "exposition" will seem strange; it will seem to them too strict to be upbuilding, and too upbuilding to be strictly scientific. As to the latter point, I have no opinion. As to the former, I beg leave to differ; and if it were true that the form is too strict to be upbuilding, I should regard that as a fault. It is a different question whether the form may not seem too strict to the edifying, in the sense in which everyone now understands that word; and as to that, I have no opinion. But that it is too strict to be upbuilding, I deny; for the upbuilding is not the loose, the lax, the sentimentally flabby, but the strict, the rigorous, the strenuous.

It is a Christian exposition, and so the form is not scientific. For Christianly understood, "truth" is not the same as it is in the sense of philosophy, an objective, uncertain something, indifferent to the existing subject; no, Christianly understood, truth is the subjective, the inwardness, the appropriation, the being-in-truth. Therefore, it is not scientific.

Chapter 1: Sickness Unto Death is Despair

A. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

1. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have three forms: in Despair at not being conscious of having a Self (Despair Improperly So Called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another. If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation. Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be a question only of one form: not willing to be one's own self, of willing to get rid of oneself, but there would be no question of despair at willing to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted it. And so despair, which is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself, signifies that the self does not do this, but in the relation to itself relates itself to another.
