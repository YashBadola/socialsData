The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By 'simple' is meant that without parts.

And there must be simple substances, since there are compounds; for a compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.

Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things.

No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.

For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into being by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the combination of parts (composition).

Thus it may be said that a Monad can only come into being or end all at once; that is to say, it can come into being only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is compound begins or ends by parts.

There is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of compounds, in which there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can come into a Monad from outside.

Yet the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ from each other, there would be no way of perceiving any change in things, for what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains.

Each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality.

I assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.

It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.

But, besides the principle of the change, there must be a particular series of changes, which constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature and variety of the simple substances.

This particular series of changes should involve a multiplicity in the unit or in that which is simple. For, as every natural change takes place gradually, something changes and something remains immutable; and consequently a simple substance must be affected and related in many ways, although it has no parts.

The passing condition, which involves and represents a multiplicity in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in the following. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies.

If we wish to discover what constitutes the nature of a simple substance, or Monad, we must look for it in Perception and Appetition. For since the Monad is a simple substance, it cannot have parts, and consequently it cannot have any extension, figure, or divisibility. It is therefore impossible to find in it anything but perceptions and their changes.

The action of the internal principle which brings about the change or passage from one perception to another may be called Appetition; it is true that desire cannot always fully attain to the whole perception at which it aims, but it always obtains some of it and reaches new perceptions.
