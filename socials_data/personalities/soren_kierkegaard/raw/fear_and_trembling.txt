Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without humble regard for individual subjects to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they are going further. Having made this preliminary movement, they have probably made it in such a way that they do not need to make it again, and so presumably they have also understood that to doubt everything is not an easy thing to do, that it is not a task one can undertake in an off-hand manner—unless one is prepared to look as foolish as the person who would attempt to weave with a heavy hand.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior—yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after being subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mind at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to cite them on every occasion)—or else there never has been faith...

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. To get the princess, to live with her joyfully and happily day by day (for it is also conceivable that the knight of resignation might get the princess, but that his soul had discerned the impossibility of their future happiness), to express the sublime in the pedestrian—that only the knight of faith can do, and this is the one and only prodigy.
