   reciprocal. For God, in comparing two simple substances, finds in each
   one reasons obliging him to adapt the other to it; and consequently
   what is active in certain respects is passive from another point of

   a reason for what occurs in another, and passive in so far as the
   reason for what occurs in it is found in what is distinctly known in
   another.
