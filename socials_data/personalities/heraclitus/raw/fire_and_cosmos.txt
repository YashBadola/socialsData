This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.
The transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind.
All things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.
It is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.
Fire is want and surfeit.
Fire in its advance will judge and convict all things.
For it is death to souls to become water, and death to water to become earth. But water comes from earth; and from water, soul.
The way up and the way down is one and the same.
