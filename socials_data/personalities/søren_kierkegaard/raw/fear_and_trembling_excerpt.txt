Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a curious thing for them to be going further. Having made this polite admission, of which we have all made a clean breast to one another, so that no one may be unjustly lagged behind as not having doubted everything, one might then surely ask: How far is it that they have come?

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after being subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the single individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to judge) there never has been faith...

If there is no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there is only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produces everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lies hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation rose up after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation succeeded the other as the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lies hungrily watching for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches—how empty and devoid of comfort would life be!
