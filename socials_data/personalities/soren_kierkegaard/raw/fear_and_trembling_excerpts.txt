Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

The Knight of Faith

If I were to speak of the knight of faith, I should say: "It is supposed to be the most difficult task of all to achieve the resignation of faith; but it is even more difficult to remain in it."

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. But the knight of faith knows it is glorious to belong to the infinite.

The Absurd

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the individual as the individual is higher than the universal, is justified vis-à-vis it, is not subordinate but superior.

Abraham and Isaac

Abraham is the knight of faith. He believed by virtue of the absurd. He did not believe that he would be saved in some future life, but that he would be happy here in this world. He believed that God would not demand Isaac of him, yet he was willing to sacrifice him.

Infinite Resignation

Infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith. For only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.
