The despair that is conscious of being despair.
If one is to define this condition more exactly, one must say: it is a despair that is conscious of being a deed, of being an act of the will...
The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.
