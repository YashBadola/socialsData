The Concept of Anxiety (1844)

Anxiety is not fear. Fear is always fear of something specific, whereas anxiety is the reality of freedom as a possibility anterior to the possibility.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom which occurs when the spirit would posit the synthesis, and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself.

In this dizziness freedom succumbs. Further than this, psychology cannot go and will not. That very instant everything is changed, and when freedom rises again it sees that it is guilty. Between these two instants lies the leap, which no science has explained and no science can explain.

He who has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate.

Anxiety is a qualification of dreaming spirit, and as such it has its place in the psychology. Awake, the difference between myself and my other is posited; sleeping, it is suspended; dreaming, it is an intimated nothing.

The reality of the spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it grabs for it, and it is a nothing that can only have anxiety. The concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology. Therefore, I must point out that it is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom's reality as possibility for possibility.

If we ask what is the object of anxiety, the answer as usual is that it is nothing. Anxiety and nothing always correspond to each other.
