{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and taken for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. This proceeding has all of them to support it and has even made itself plausible to the French. Now a Frenchman has the name of being steady and sedate, but he also has a fire in his belly, and if we are to believe the words of the Frenchman who maintains that he has doubted everything, we must verify the statement by seeing whether his conduct fits his words.\n...\nAbraham I\nAnd God tempted Abraham and said unto him, Take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon the mountain which I will show thee.\nIt was early in the morning, Abraham rose betimes, and had his asses saddled, left his tent, and Isaac with him, but Sarah looked out of the window after them until they had gone down the valley and she could see them no more. They rode in silence for three days. On the morning of the fourth day Abraham said never a word, but he lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off. He left his young men behind and went on alone with Isaac, leading him by the hand. But when Abraham looked up he saw the mountain afar off, and his soul was exceeding sorrowful. And he said to himself: I will not conceal from Isaac whither this journey leads. He stood still, he laid his hand upon Isaac\u2019s head in benediction, and said: \u201cMy son, God has required of me a burnt offering; the victim is thyself.\u201d But Isaac answered: \u201cGod\u2019s will be done! God who gave me to thee can take me from thee.\u201d Then Abraham\u2019s countenance was changed, his look was paternal, his eye was mild, his speech was admonishing. \u201cMy son,\u201d he said, \u201cdidst thou think it was God\u2019s requirement? No, it is my desire.\u201d\n...\nPreamble from the Heart\nWhatever one may have to say about the magnitude of the marvel, the hero is the marvel. The hero is the marvel, and the marvel is the hero. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero, and the marvel is the marvel because it is the marvel. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nPreface\nThe form of this exposition is such that it might seem perhaps to some people strictly speaking not to be edifying. It is, however, edifying in the strictest sense, inasmuch as it is Christian; and if it is not edifying in the Christian sense, it is not edifying at all. The fact that the form is not edifying in the ordinary sense is due to the fact that the exposition is dialectical. But just as this work is not written for edification in the ordinary sense, so neither is it written for the sake of edification in the ordinary sense. It is written for edification in the Christian sense, and therefore for upbuilding in the Christian sense.\nChapter 1: The Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if, on the contrary, the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairing to will to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
