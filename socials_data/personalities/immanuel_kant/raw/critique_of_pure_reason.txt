The Critique of Pure Reason

I. THEME OF THE FIRST CRITIQUE

Human reason, in one sphere of its cognition, is called upon to consider
questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented by its own
nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every faculty of
the mind.

It falls into this difficulty without any fault of its own. It begins
with principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field of
experience, and the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the same
time, insured by experience. With these principles it rises, in
obedience to the laws of its own nature, to ever higher and more remote
conditions. But it quickly discovers that, in this way, its labour must
remain ever incomplete, because new questions never cease to present
themselves; and thus it finds itself compelled to have recourse to
principles which transcend the region of experience, while they are
regarded by common sense without distrust. It thus falls into confusion
and contradictions, from which it conjectures the presence of latent
errors, which, however, it is unable to discover, because the principles
it employs, transcending the limits of experience, cannot be tested by
that criterion. The arena of these endless contests is called
Metaphysic.

Time was, when she was the queen of all the sciences; and, if we take
the will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards the
high importance of her object-matter, this title of honour. Now, it is
the fashion of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her; and the
matron mourns, forlorn and forsaken, like Hecuba:

  Modo maxima rerum,
  Tot generis, natisque potens...
  Nunc trahor exul, inops.

...

For the chief question is always simply this: "What and how much can
the understanding and reason know apart from all experience?" not:
"How is the faculty of thought itself possible?" The first only is
necessary to the determination of the nature of the instrument, the
truth of the result to be aimed at; the latter is merely an auxiliary
study, but one which we cannot entirely dispense with.

...

I have therefore found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to make
room for faith. The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption
that it is possible to make progress in metaphysics without previous
criticism of pure reason, is the true source of all that unbelief,
always very dogmatic, which wars against morality.
