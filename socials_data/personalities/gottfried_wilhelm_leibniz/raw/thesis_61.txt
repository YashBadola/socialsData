61. In this respect compounds are like simple substances, for all space
   is filled up; therefore, all matter is connected. And in a plenum or
   filled space every movement has an effect upon bodies in proportion to
   this distance, so that not only is every body affected by those which
   are in contact with it and responds in some way to whatever happens to
   them, but also by means of them the body responds to, those bodies
   adjoining them, and their intercommunication reaches to any distance
   whatsoever. Consequently every body responds to all that happens in the
   universe, so that h e who saw all could read in each one what is
   happening everywhere, and even what has happened and what will happen.
   He can discover in the present what is distant both as regards space

   can, however, read in itself only what is there represented distinctly.
   It cannot all at once open up all its folds, because they extend to
   infinity.
