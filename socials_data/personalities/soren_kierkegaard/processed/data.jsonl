{"text": "Title: Either/Or\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\nPseudonym: Victor Eremita\nDIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa Summarum: I do not care at all.\nThere are two ways of being fooled. One is to believe what is not true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men\u2019s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a trifle...\nTHE ROTATION OF CROPS\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all sorts of high-flown nonentities. I happen to know that they are wrong, because I have a basic principle that I think is really good, and it goes like this: All men are bores.\nThe truth of this proposition is beyond doubt. If I were to wish for a new life, I would not wish for wealth or power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Title: Fear and Trembling\nAuthor: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\nPseudonym: Johannes de Silentio\nPREFACE\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping with doubt everything but is going further.\nPANEGYRIC UPON ABRAHAM\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage in the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there was no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw--how empty then and comfortless life would be!\nBut therefore it is not thus...\nBy faith Abraham emigrated from the land of his fathers and became an alien in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him. He left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him--otherwise he would surely not have emigrated but would have thought this a very unreasonable thing to do.\nBy faith he was a stranger in the land of promise, and there was nothing to recall what was dear to him, but everything by its newness tempted his soul to sorrowful longing. And yet he was God's chosen one, in whom the Lord was well pleased! Indeed, if he had been one cast off, rejected from God's grace, he could have comprehended it better; but now it was like a mockery of him and of his faith. There was in the world one who lived also in banishment, but he was not God's chosen one. Abraham was not like him...\nAbraham was great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of the love which is hatred of oneself.\nPROBLEM I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and he can only recognize this by recognizing his particularity...\nIf this is the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on \"The Good and the Conscience,\" he characterizes man only as the particular and regards this character as \"a moral form of evil\" which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or tempted. On the other hand, Hegel is wrong in talking about faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted of murder.\nFor faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
