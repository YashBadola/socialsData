Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern science, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might be premature and almost unbecoming to ask where they are going, but surely it is courteous and altogether proper to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd of them to say that they were proceeding further. This proceeding further has actually been accomplished by our own age, and indeed we have proof of it, for otherwise the age would not be the age of the clearance sale.

The present writer is in no sense a philosopher. He is, poetically and elegantly, an amateur writer who neither writes the System nor gives promises of the System, who neither subscribes to the System nor ascribes anything to it. He writes because to him it is a luxury that becomes the more agreeable and evident the fewer there are who buy and read what he writes.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente) there never has been faith... precisely because it has always been present. In that case Abraham is lost.
