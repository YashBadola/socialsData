OF THE SOURCES OF THE GENERAL OR PUBLIC\nREVENUE OF THE SOCIETY.\nCHAPTER III. OF PUBLIC DEBTS.\nINTRODUCTION AND PLAN OF THE WORK.\nThe annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it\nwith all the necessaries and conveniencies of life which it annually\nconsumes, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that\nlabour, or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations.\nAccording, therefore, as this produce, or what is purchased with it, bears\na greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume\nit, the nation will be better or worse supplied with all the necessaries\nand conveniencies for which it has occasion.\nBut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different\ncircumstances: first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its\nlabour is generally applied; and, secondly, by the proportion between the\nnumber of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who\nare not so employed. Whatever be the soil, climate, or extent of territory\nof any particular nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual supply\nmust, in that particular situation, depend upon those two circumstances.\nThe abundance or scantiness of this supply, too, seems to depend more upon\nthe former of those two circumstances than upon the latter. Among the\nsavage nations of hunters and fishers, every individual who is able to\nwork is more or less employed in useful labour, and endeavours to provide,\nas well as he can, the necessaries and conveniencies of life, for himself,\nand such of his family or tribe as are either too old, or too young, or\ntoo infirm, to go a-hunting and fishing. Such nations, however, are so\nmiserably poor, that, from mere want, they are frequently reduced, or at\nleast think themselves reduced, to the necessity sometimes of directly\ndestroying, and sometimes of abandoning their infants, their old people,\nand those afflicted with lingering diseases, to perish with hunger, or to\nbe devoured by wild beasts. Among civilized and thriving nations, on the\ncontrary, though a great number of people do not labour at all, many of\nwhom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times, more\nlabour than the greater part of those who work; yet the produce of the\nwhole labour of the society is so great, that all are often abundantly\nsupplied; and a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order, if he is\nfrugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and\nconveniencies of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\nThe causes of this improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the\norder according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the\ndifferent ranks and conditions of men in the society, make the subject of\nthe first book of this Inquiry.\nWhatever be the actual state of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with\nwhich labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of its\nannual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon the\nproportion between the number of those who are annually employed in useful\nlabour, and that of those who are not so employed. The number of useful\nand productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is everywhere in\nproportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting\nthem to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The\nsecond book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital stock, of the\nmanner in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different\nquantities of labour which it puts into motion, according to the different\nways in which it is employed.\nNations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in\nthe application of labour, have followed very different plans in the\ngeneral conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been\nequally favourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some\nnations has given extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the\ncountry; that of others to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has\ndealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry. Since the\ndown-fall of the Roman empire, the policy of Europe has been more\nfavourable to arts, manufactures, and commerce, the industry of towns,\nthan to agriculture, the Industry of the country. The circumstances which\nseem to have introduced and established this policy are explained in the\nthird book.\nThough those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the\nprivate interests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without any\nregard to, or foresight of, their consequences upon the general welfare of\nthe society; yet they have given occasion to very different theories of\npolitical economy; of which some magnify the importance of that industry\nwhich is carried on in towns, others of that which is carried on in the\ncountry. Those theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon\nthe opinions of men of learning, but upon the public conduct of princes\nand sovereign states. I have endeavoured, in the fourth book, to explain\nas fully and distinctly as I can those different theories, and the\nprincipal effects which they have produced in different ages and nations.\nTo explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the\npeople, or what has been the nature of those funds, which, in different\nages and nations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of\nthese four first books. The fifth and last book treats of the revenue of\nthe sovereign, or commonwealth. In this book I have endeavoured to shew,\nfirst, what are the necessary expenses of the sovereign, or commonwealth;\nwhich of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution\nof the whole society, and which of them, by that of some particular part\nonly, or of some particular members of it: secondly, what are the\ndifferent methods in which the whole society may be made to contribute\ntowards defraying the expenses incumbent on the whole society, and what\nare the principal advantages and inconveniencies of each of those methods;\nand, thirdly and lastly, what are the reasons and causes which have\ninduced almost all modern governments to mortgage some part of this\nrevenue, or to contract debts; and what have been the effects of those\ndebts upon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of\nthe society.\nBOOK I.\nOF THE CAUSES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE\nPRODUCTIVE POWERS OF LABOUR, AND OF THE ORDER ACCORDING TO WHICH ITS PRODUCE IS\nNATURALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE PEOPLE.\nCHAPTER I.\nOF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.\nThe greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the\ngreater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is\nanywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the\ndivision of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general\nbusiness of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in\nwhat manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly\nsupposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps\nthat it really is carried further in them than in others of more\nimportance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to\nsupply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number\nof workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same\nworkhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.\nIn those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply\nthe great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of\nthe work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to\ncollect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one\ntime, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such\nmanufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much\ngreater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the\ndivision is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less\nobserved.\nTo take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one\nin which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the\ntrade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the\ndivision of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the\nuse of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same\ndivision of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps,\nwith his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not\nmake twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not\nonly the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number\nof branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One\nman draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth\npoints it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make\nthe head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a\npeculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\nitself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a\npin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations,\nwhich, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though\nin others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have\nseen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed,\nand where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct\noperations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but\nindifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when\nthey exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a\nday. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling\nsize. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of\nforty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth\npart of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\nthousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought\nseparately and independently, and without any of them having been educated\nto this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made\ntwenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two\nhundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part\nof what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a\nproper division and combination of their different operations.\nIn every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour\nare similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of\nthem, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so\ngreat a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far\nas it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable\nincrease of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different\ntrades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in\nconsequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried\nfurthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and\nimprovement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society,\nbeing generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved\nsociety, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer,\nnothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce\nany one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great\nnumber of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of\nthe linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the\nwool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\ndressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit\nof so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one\nbusiness from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so\nentirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the\ntrade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The\nspinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the\nploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the\ncorn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of\nlabour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible\nthat one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This\nimpossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the\ndifferent branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the\nreason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this\nart, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The\nmost opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in\nagriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more\ndistinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\nlands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\nbestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\nfertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much\nmore than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In\nagriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more\nproductive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more\nproductive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich\ncountry, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come\ncheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same\ndegree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the\nsuperior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of\nFrance is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly\nabout the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and\nimprovement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of\nEngland, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the\ncorn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of\nPoland. But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of\nits cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and\ngoodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its\nmanufactures, at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and\nsituation, of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper\nthan those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the\npresent high duties upon the importation of raw silk, does not so well\nsuit the climate of England as that of France. But the hardware and the\ncoarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior to those of\nFrance, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In Poland\nthere are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those\ncoarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well\nsubsist.\nThis great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the\ndivision of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing,\nis owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of\ndexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time\nwhich is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another;\nand, lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which\nfacilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.\nFirst, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily\nincreases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of\nlabour, by reducing every man\u2019s business to some one simple operation, and\nby making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily\nincreases very much the dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who,\nthough accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails,\nif, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will\nscarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in\na day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to\nmake nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a\nnailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence, make more than eight\nhundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys, under\ntwenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of\nmaking nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of\nthem, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of\na nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same\nperson blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion,\nheats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head,\ntoo, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into\nwhich the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of\nthem much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it\nhas been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The\nrapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are\nperformed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen\nthem, be supposed capable of acquiring.\nSecondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost\nin passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we\nshould at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very\nquickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a\ndifferent place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who\ncultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from\nhis loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades\ncan be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt,\nmuch less. It is, even in this case, however, very considerable. A man\ncommonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment\nto another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and\nhearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he\nrather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and\nof indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather\nnecessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change\nhis work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty\ndifferent ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always\nslothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the\nmost pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in\npoint of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the\nquantity of work which he is capable of performing.\nThirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is\nfacilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is\nunnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the\ninvention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and\nabridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.\nMen are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of\nattaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed\ntowards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great\nvariety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labour, the\nwhole of every man\u2019s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some\none very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that\nsome one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of\nlabour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their\nown particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement.\nA great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which\nlabour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common\nworkmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,\nnaturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier\nmethods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such\nmanufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which\nwere the inventions of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken\ntheir own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines {this was\nthe current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed\nto open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the\ncylinder, according as the piston either ascended or descended. One of\nthose boys, who loved to play with his companions, observed that, by tying\na string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to\nanother part of the machine, the valve would open and shut without his\nassistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his\nplay-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon\nthis machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the\ndiscovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour.\nAll the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the\ninventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many\nimprovements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the\nmachines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and\nsome by that of those who are called philosophers, or men of speculation,\nwhose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every thing, and\nwho, upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers\nof the most distant and dissimilar objects in the progress of society,\nphilosophy or speculation becomes, like every other employment, the\nprincipal or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens.\nLike every other employment, too, it is subdivided into a great number of\ndifferent branches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe\nor class of philosophers; and this subdivision of employment in\nphilosophy, as well as in every other business, improves dexterity, and\nsaves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own peculiar\nbranch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science is\nconsiderably increased by it.\nIt is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different\narts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a\nwell-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the\nlowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own\nwork to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every\nother workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to\nexchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or, what\ncomes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He\nsupplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they\naccommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general\nplenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the society.\nObserve the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a\ncivilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of\npeople, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been\nemployed in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The\nwoollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and\nrough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great\nmultitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the\nwool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver,\nthe fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different\narts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants\nand carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the\nmaterials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very\ndistant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in\nparticular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers,\nmust have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs\nmade use of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the\nworld? What a variety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the\ntools of the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated\nmachines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the\nloom of the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labour is\nrequisite in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which\nthe shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for\nsmelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to\nbe made use of in the smelting-house, the brickmaker, the bricklayer, the\nworkmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the forger, the smith,\nmust all of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were\nwe to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress\nand household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears next his\nskin, the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all\nthe different parts which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he\nprepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose,\ndug from the bowels of the earth, and brought to him, perhaps, by a long\nsea and a long land-carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all\nthe furniture of his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter\nplates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals, the different\nhands employed in preparing his bread and his beer, the glass window which\nlets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the wind and the rain, with\nall the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy\ninvention, without which these northern parts of the world could scarce\nhave afforded a very comfortable habitation, together with the tools of\nall the different workmen employed in producing those different\nconveniencies; if we examine, I say, all these things, and consider what a\nvariety of labour is employed about each of them, we shall be sensible\nthat, without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the very\nmeanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even\naccording to, what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in\nwhich he is commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more\nextravagant luxury of the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear\nextremely simple and easy; and yet it may be true, perhaps, that the\naccommodation of an European prince does not always so much exceed that of\nan industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the latter\nexceeds that of many an African king, the absolute masters of the lives\nand liberties of ten thousand naked savages.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION\nTO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.\nThis division of labour, from which so many advantages are derived, is not\noriginally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that\ngeneral opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though\nvery slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human\nnature, which has in view no such extensive utility; the propensity to\ntruck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.\nWhether this propensity be one of those original principles in human\nnature, of which no further account can be given, or whether, as seems\nmore probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason\nand speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire. It is common\nto all men, and to be found in no other race of animals, which seem to\nknow neither this nor any other species of contracts. Two greyhounds, in\nrunning down the same hare, have sometimes the appearance of acting in\nsome sort of concert. Each turns her towards his companion, or endeavours\nto intercept her when his companion turns her towards himself. This,\nhowever, is not the effect of any contract, but of the accidental\nconcurrence of their passions in the same object at that particular time.\nNobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for\nanother with another dog. Nobody ever saw one animal, by its gestures and\nnatural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am willing\nto give this for that. When an animal wants to obtain something either of\na man, or of another animal, it has no other means of persuasion, but to\ngain the favour of those whose service it requires. A puppy fawns upon its\ndam, and a spaniel endeavours, by a thousand attractions, to engage the\nattention of its master who is at dinner, when it wants to be fed by him.\nMan sometimes uses the same arts with his brethren, and when he has no\nother means of engaging them to act according to his inclinations,\nendeavours by every servile and fawning attention to obtain their good\nwill. He has not time, however, to do this upon every occasion. In\ncivilized society he stands at all times in need of the co-operation and\nassistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is scarce sufficient\nto gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every other race of\nanimals, each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is entirely\nindependent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance of\nno other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the\nhelp of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their\nbenevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest\ntheir self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their own\nadvantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to\nanother a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I\nwant, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such\noffer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far\ngreater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not\nfrom the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we\nexpect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address\nourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk\nto them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a\nbeggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his\nfellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon it entirely. The\ncharity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him with the whole fund\nof his subsistence. But though this principle ultimately provides him with\nall the necessaries of life which he has occasion for, it neither does nor\ncan provide him with them as he has occasion for them. The greater part of\nhis occasional wants are supplied in the same manner as those of other\npeople, by treaty, by barter, and by purchase. With the money which one\nman gives him he purchases food. The old clothes which another bestows\nupon him he exchanges for other clothes which suit him better, or for\nlodging, or for food, or for money, with which he can buy either food,\nclothes, or lodging, as he has occasion.\nAs it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one\nanother the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in\nneed of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives\noccasion to the division of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds, a\nparticular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness\nand dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or\nfor venison, with his companions; and he finds at last that he can, in\nthis manner, get more cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the\nfield to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the\nmaking of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a\nsort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their\nlittle huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way\nto his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with\nvenison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself\nentirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In\nthe same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a tanner\nor dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of\nsavages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus\npart of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own\nconsumption, for such parts of the produce of other men\u2019s labour as he may\nhave occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular\noccupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or\ngenius he may possess for that particular species of business.\nThe difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much\nless than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to\ndistinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is\nnot upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division\nof labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between\na philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not\nso much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came\nin to the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence,\nthey were, perhaps, very much alike, and neither their parents nor\nplay-fellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or\nsoon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The\ndifference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by\ndegrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to\nacknowledge scarce any resemblance. But without the disposition to truck,\nbarter, and exchange, every man must have procured to himself every\nnecessary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All must have had the\nsame duties to perform, and the same work to do, and there could have been\nno such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great\ndifference of talents.\nAs it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so\nremarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same\ndisposition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals,\nacknowledged to be all of the same species, derive from nature a much more\nremarkable distinction of genius, than what, antecedent to custom and\neducation, appears to take place among men. By nature a philosopher is not\nin genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a\nmastiff is from a grey-hound, or a grey-hound from a spaniel, or this last\nfrom a shepherd\u2019s dog. Those different tribes of animals, however, though\nall of the same species are of scarce any use to one another. The strength\nof the mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of\nthe greyhound, or by the sagacity of the spaniel, or by the docility of\nthe shepherd\u2019s dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents,\nfor want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be\nbrought into a common stock, and do not in the least contribute to the\nbetter accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each animal is still\nobliged to support and defend itself, separately and independently, and\nderives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which\nnature has distinguished its fellows. Among men, on the contrary, the most\ndissimilar geniuses are of use to one another; the different produces of\ntheir respective talents, by the general disposition to truck, barter, and\nexchange, being brought, as it were, into a common stock, where every man\nmay purchase whatever part of the produce of other men\u2019s talents he has\noccasion for.\nCHAPTER III.\nTHAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS\nLIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET.\nAs it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of\nlabour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the\nextent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market.\nWhen the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to\ndedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to\nexchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is\nover and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other\nmen\u2019s labour as he has occasion for.\nThere are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can be\ncarried on nowhere but in a great town. A porter, for example, can find\nemployment and subsistence in no other place. A village is by much too\nnarrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary market-town is scarce large\nenough to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and very\nsmall villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the\nhighlands of Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker, and brewer,\nfor his own family. In such situations we can scarce expect to find even a\nsmith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than twenty miles of another\nof the same trade. The scattered families that live at eight or ten miles\ndistance from the nearest of them, must learn to perform themselves a\ngreat number of little pieces of work, for which, in more populous\ncountries, they would call in the assistance of those workmen. Country\nworkmen are almost everywhere obliged to apply themselves to all the\ndifferent branches of industry that have so much affinity to one another\nas to be employed about the same sort of materials. A country carpenter\ndeals in every sort of work that is made of wood; a country smith in every\nsort of work that is made of iron. The former is not only a carpenter, but\na joiner, a cabinet-maker, and even a carver in wood, as well as a\nwheel-wright, a plough-wright, a cart and waggon-maker. The employments of\nthe latter are still more various. It is impossible there should be such a\ntrade as even that of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the\nhighlands of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails\na-day, and three hundred working days in the year, will make three hundred\nthousand nails in the year. But in such a situation it would be impossible\nto dispose of one thousand, that is, of one day\u2019s work in the year. As by\nmeans of water-carriage, a more extensive market is opened to every sort\nof industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is upon the\nsea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every\nkind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is\nfrequently not till a long time after that those improvements extend\nthemselves to the inland parts of the country. A broad-wheeled waggon,\nattended by two men, and drawn by eight horses, in about six weeks time,\ncarries and brings back between London and Edinburgh near four ton weight\nof goods. In about the same time a ship navigated by six or eight men, and\nsailing between the ports of London and Leith, frequently carries and\nbrings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six or eight men, therefore,\nby the help of water-carriage, can carry and bring back, in the same time,\nthe same quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh as fifty\nbroad-wheeled waggons, attended by a hundred men, and drawn by four\nhundred horses. Upon two hundred tons of goods, therefore, carried by the\ncheapest land-carriage from London to Edinburgh, there must be charged the\nmaintenance of a hundred men for three weeks, and both the maintenance and\nwhat is nearly equal to maintenance the wear and tear of four hundred\nhorses, as well as of fifty great waggons. Whereas, upon the same quantity\nof goods carried by water, there is to be charged only the maintenance of\nsix or eight men, and the wear and tear of a ship of two hundred tons\nburthen, together with the value of the superior risk, or the difference\nof the insurance between land and water-carriage. Were there no other\ncommunication between those two places, therefore, but by land-carriage,\nas no goods could be transported from the one to the other, except such\nwhose price was very considerable in proportion to their weight, they\ncould carry on but a small part of that commerce which at present subsists\nbetween them, and consequently could give but a small part of that\nencouragement which they at present mutually afford to each other\u2019s\nindustry. There could be little or no commerce of any kind between the\ndistant parts of the world. What goods could bear the expense of\nland-carriage between London and Calcutta? Or if there were any so\nprecious as to be able to support this expense, with what safety could\nthey be transported through the territories of so many barbarous nations?\nThose two cities, however, at present carry on a very considerable\ncommerce with each other, and by mutually affording a market, give a good\ndeal of encouragement to each other\u2019s industry.\nSince such, therefore, are the advantages of water-carriage, it is natural\nthat the first improvements of art and industry should be made where this\nconveniency opens the whole world for a market to the produce of every\nsort of labour, and that they should always be much later in extending\nthemselves into the inland parts of the country. The inland parts of the\ncountry can for a long time have no other market for the greater part of\ntheir goods, but the country which lies round about them, and separates\nthem from the sea-coast, and the great navigable rivers. The extent of the\nmarket, therefore, must for a long time be in proportion to the riches and\npopulousness of that country, and consequently their improvement must\nalways be posterior to the improvement of that country. In our North\nAmerican colonies, the plantations have constantly followed either the\nsea-coast or the banks of the navigable rivers, and have scarce anywhere\nextended themselves to any considerable distance from both.\nThe nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear to\nhave been first civilized, were those that dwelt round the coast of the\nMediterranean sea. That sea, by far the greatest inlet that is known in\nthe world, having no tides, nor consequently any waves, except such as are\ncaused by the wind only, was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well as\nby the multitude of its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring\nshores, extremely favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when,\nfrom their ignorance of the compass, men were afraid to quit the view of\nthe coast, and from the imperfection of the art of ship-building, to\nabandon themselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond\nthe pillars of Hercules, that is, to sail out of the straits of Gibraltar,\nwas, in the ancient world, long considered as a most wonderful and\ndangerous exploit of navigation. It was late before even the Phoenicians\nand Carthaginians, the most skilful navigators and ship-builders of those\nold times, attempted it; and they were, for a long time, the only nations\nthat did attempt it.\nOf all the countries on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, Egypt seems to\nhave been the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were\ncultivated and improved to any considerable degree. Upper Egypt extends\nitself nowhere above a few miles from the Nile; and in Lower Egypt, that\ngreat river breaks itself into many different canals, which, with the\nassistance of a little art, seem to have afforded a communication by\nwater-carriage, not only between all the great towns, but between all the\nconsiderable villages, and even to many farm-houses in the country, nearly\nin the same manner as the Rhine and the Maese do in Holland at present.\nThe extent and easiness of this inland navigation was probably one of the\nprincipal causes of the early improvement of Egypt.\nThe improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to have\nbeen of very great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal, in the East\nIndies, and in some of the eastern provinces of China, though the great\nextent of this antiquity is not authenticated by any histories of whose\nauthority we, in this part of the world, are well assured. In Bengal, the\nGanges, and several other great rivers, form a great number of navigable\ncanals, in the same manner as the Nile does in Egypt. In the eastern\nprovinces of China, too, several great rivers form, by their different\nbranches, a multitude of canals, and, by communicating with one another,\nafford an inland navigation much more extensive than that either of the\nNile or the Ganges, or, perhaps, than both of them put together. It is\nremarkable, that neither the ancient Egyptians, nor the Indians, nor the\nChinese, encouraged foreign commerce, but seem all to have derived their\ngreat opulence from this inland navigation.\nAll the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies any\nconsiderable way north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the ancient\nScythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, seem, in all ages of the world,\nto have been in the same barbarous and uncivilized state in which we find\nthem at present. The sea of Tartary is the frozen ocean, which admits of\nno navigation; and though some of the greatest rivers in the world run\nthrough that country, they are at too great a distance from one another to\ncarry commerce and communication through the greater part of it. There are\nin Africa none of those great inlets, such as the Baltic and Adriatic seas\nin Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas in both Europe and Asia, and\nthe gulfs of Arabia, Persia, India, Bengal, and Siam, in Asia, to carry\nmaritime commerce into the interior parts of that great continent; and the\ngreat rivers of Africa are at too great a distance from one another to\ngive occasion to any considerable inland navigation. The commerce,\nbesides, which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not\nbreak itself into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs\ninto another territory before it reaches the sea, can never be very\nconsiderable, because it is always in the power of the nations who possess\nthat other territory to obstruct the communication between the upper\ncountry and the sea. The navigation of the Danube is of very little use to\nthe different states of Bavaria, Austria, and Hungary, in comparison of\nwhat it would be, if any of them possessed the whole of its course, till\nit falls into the Black sea.\nCHAPTER IV.\nOF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY.\nWhen the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is\nbut a very small part of a man\u2019s wants which the produce of his own labour\ncan supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that\nsurplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his\nown consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men\u2019s labour as he\nhas occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some\nmeasure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a\ncommercial society.\nBut when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of\nexchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in\nits operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a certain commodity\nthan he himself has occasion for, while another has less. The former,\nconsequently, would be glad to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a\npart of this superfluity. But if this latter should chance to have nothing\nthat the former stands in need of, no exchange can be made between them.\nThe butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the\nbrewer and the baker would each of them be willing to purchase a part of\nit. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, except the different\nproductions of their respective trades, and the butcher is already\nprovided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate occasion for.\nNo exchange can, in this case, be made between them. He cannot be their\nmerchant, nor they his customers; and they are all of them thus mutually\nless serviceable to one another. In order to avoid the inconveniency of\nsuch situations, every prudent man in every period of society, after the\nfirst establishment of the division of labour, must naturally have\nendeavoured to manage his affairs in such a manner, as to have at all\ntimes by him, besides the peculiar produce of his own industry, a certain\nquantity of some one commodity or other, such as he imagined few people\nwould be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce of their industry.\nMany different commodities, it is probable, were successively both thought\nof and employed for this purpose. In the rude ages of society, cattle are\nsaid to have been the common instrument of commerce; and, though they must\nhave been a most inconvenient one, yet, in old times, we find things were\nfrequently valued according to the number of cattle which had been given\nin exchange for them. The armour of Diomede, says Homer, cost only nine\noxen; but that of Glaucus cost a hundred oxen. Salt is said to be the\ncommon instrument of commerce and exchanges in Abyssinia; a species of\nshells in some parts of the coast of India; dried cod at Newfoundland;\ntobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our West India colonies; hides or\ndressed leather in some other countries; and there is at this day a\nvillage in Scotland, where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to\ncarry nails instead of money to the baker\u2019s shop or the ale-house.\nIn all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined by\nirresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to\nmetals above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as\nlittle loss as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable\nthan they are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into\nany number of parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be re-united\nagain; a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess, and\nwhich, more than any other quality, renders them fit to be the instruments\nof commerce and circulation. The man who wanted to buy salt, for example,\nand had nothing but cattle to give in exchange for it, must have been\nobliged to buy salt to the value of a whole ox, or a whole sheep, at a\ntime. He could seldom buy less than this, because what he was to give for\nit could seldom be divided without loss; and if he had a mind to buy more,\nhe must, for the same reasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple\nthe quantity, the value, to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three\nsheep. If, on the contrary, instead of sheep or oxen, he had metals to\ngive in exchange for it, he could easily proportion the quantity of the\nmetal to the precise quantity of the commodity which he had immediate\noccasion for.\nDifferent metals have been made use of by different nations for this\npurpose. Iron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient\nSpartans, copper among the ancient Romans, and gold and silver among all\nrich and commercial nations.\nThose metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in\nrude bars, without any stamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny (Plin.\nHist Nat. lib. 33, cap. 3), upon the authority of Timaeus, an ancient\nhistorian, that, till the time of Servius Tullius, the Romans had no\ncoined money, but made use of unstamped bars of copper, to purchase\nwhatever they had occasion for. These rude bars, therefore, performed at\nthis time the function of money.\nThe use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very\nconsiderable inconveniences; first, with the trouble of weighing, and\nsecondly, with that of assaying them. In the precious metals, where a\nsmall difference in the quantity makes a great difference in the value,\neven the business of weighing, with proper exactness, requires at least\nvery accurate weights and scales. The weighing of gold, in particular, is\nan operation of some nicety in the coarser metals, indeed, where a small\nerror would be of little consequence, less accuracy would, no doubt, be\nnecessary. Yet we should find it excessively troublesome if every time a\npoor man had occasion either to buy or sell a farthing\u2019s worth of goods,\nhe was obliged to weigh the farthing. The operation of assaying is still\nmore difficult, still more tedious; and, unless a part of the metal is\nfairly melted in the crucible, with proper dissolvents, any conclusion\nthat can be drawn from it is extremely uncertain. Before the institution\nof coined money, however, unless they went through this tedious and\ndifficult operation, people must always have been liable to the grossest\nfrauds and impositions; and instead of a pound weight of pure silver, or\npure copper, might receive, in exchange for their goods, an adulterated\ncomposition of the coarsest and cheapest materials, which had, however, in\ntheir outward appearance, been made to resemble those metals. To prevent\nsuch abuses, to facilitate exchanges, and thereby to encourage all sorts\nof industry and commerce, it has been found necessary, in all countries\nthat have made any considerable advances towards improvement, to affix a\npublic stamp upon certain quantities of such particular metals, as were in\nthose countries commonly made use of to purchase goods. Hence the origin\nof coined money, and of those public offices called mints; institutions\nexactly of the same nature with those of the aulnagers and stamp-masters\nof woollen and linen cloth. All of them are equally meant to ascertain, by\nmeans of a public stamp, the quantity and uniform goodness of those\ndifferent commodities when brought to market.\nThe first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current\nmetals, seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it was\nboth most difficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or\nfineness of the metal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is at\npresent affixed to plate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark which is\nsometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which, being struck only upon one\nside of the piece, and not covering the whole surface, ascertains the\nfineness, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the\nfour hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay for the field of\nMachpelah. They are said, however, to be the current money of the\nmerchant, and yet are received by weight, and not by tale, in the same\nmanner as ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present. The revenues\nof the ancient Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not in\nmoney, but in kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts.\nWilliam the Conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money. This\nmoney, however, was for a long time, received at the exchequer, by weight,\nand not by tale.\nThe inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exactness,\ngave occasion to the institution of coins, of which the stamp, covering\nentirely both sides of the piece, and sometimes the edges too, was\nsupposed to ascertain not only the fineness, but the weight of the metal.\nSuch coins, therefore, were received by tale, as at present, without the\ntrouble of weighing.\nThe denominations of those coins seem originally to have expressed the\nweight or quantity of metal contained in them. In the time of Servius\nTullius, who first coined money at Rome, the Roman as or pondo contained a\nRoman pound of good copper. It was divided, in the same manner as our\nTroyes pound, into twelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce of\ngood copper. The English pound sterling, in the time of Edward I.\ncontained a pound, Tower weight, of silver of a known fineness. The Tower\npound seems to have been something more than the Roman pound, and\nsomething less than the Troyes pound. This last was not introduced into\nthe mint of England till the 18th of Henry the VIII. The French livre\ncontained, in the time of Charlemagne, a pound, Troyes weight, of silver\nof a known fineness. The fair of Troyes in Champaign was at that time\nfrequented by all the nations of Europe, and the weights and measures of\nso famous a market were generally known and esteemed. The Scots money\npound contained, from the time of Alexander the First to that of Robert\nBruce, a pound of silver of the same weight and fineness with the English\npound sterling. English, French, and Scots pennies, too, contained all of\nthem originally a real penny-weight of silver, the twentieth part of an\nounce, and the two hundred-and-fortieth part of a pound. The shilling,\ntoo, seems originally to have been the denomination of a weight. \u201cWhen\nwheat is at twelve shillings the quarter,\u201d says an ancient statute of\nHenry III. \u201cthen wastel bread of a farthing shall weigh eleven shillings\nand fourpence\u201d. The proportion, however, between the shilling, and either\nthe penny on the one hand, or the pound on the other, seems not to have\nbeen so constant and uniform as that between the penny and the pound.\nDuring the first race of the kings of France, the French sou or shilling\nappears upon different occasions to have contained five, twelve, twenty,\nand forty pennies. Among the ancient Saxons, a shilling appears at one\ntime to have contained only five pennies, and it is not improbable that it\nmay have been as variable among them as among their neighbours, the\nancient Franks. From the time of Charlemagne among the French, and from\nthat of William the Conqueror among the English, the proportion between\nthe pound, the shilling, and the penny, seems to have been uniformly the\nsame as at present, though the value of each has been very different; for\nin every country of the world, I believe, the avarice and injustice of\nprinces and sovereign states, abusing the confidence of their subjects,\nhave by degrees diminished the real quantity of metal, which had been\noriginally contained in their coins. The Roman as, in the latter ages of\nthe republic, was reduced to the twenty-fourth part of its original value,\nand, instead of weighing a pound, came to weigh only half an ounce. The\nEnglish pound and penny contain at present about a third only; the Scots\npound and penny about a thirty-sixth; and the French pound and penny about\na sixty-sixth part of their original value. By means of those operations,\nthe princes and sovereign states which performed them were enabled, in\nappearance, to pay their debts and fulfil their engagements with a smaller\nquantity of silver than would otherwise have been requisite. It was indeed\nin appearance only; for their creditors were really defrauded of a part of\nwhat was due to them. All other debtors in the state were allowed the same\nprivilege, and might pay with the same nominal sum of the new and debased\ncoin whatever they had borrowed in the old. Such operations, therefore,\nhave always proved favourable to the debtor, and ruinous to the creditor,\nand have sometimes produced a greater and more universal revolution in the\nfortunes of private persons, than could have been occasioned by a very\ngreat public calamity.\nIt is in this manner that money has become, in all civilized nations, the\nuniversal instrument of commerce, by the intervention of which goods of\nall kinds are bought and sold, or exchanged for one another.\nWhat are the rules which men naturally observe, in exchanging them either\nfor money, or for one another, I shall now proceed to examine. These rules\ndetermine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of goods.\nThe word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and\nsometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes\nthe power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object\nconveys. The one may be called \u2018value in use;\u2019 the other, \u2018value in\nexchange.\u2019 The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently\nlittle or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the\ngreatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.\nNothing is more useful than water; but it will purchase scarce any thing;\nscarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the\ncontrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other\ngoods may frequently be had in exchange for it.\nIn order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable\nvalue of commodities, I shall endeavour to shew,\nFirst, what is the real measure of this exchangeable value; or wherein\nconsists the real price of all commodities.\nSecondly, what are the different parts of which this real price is\ncomposed or made up.\nAnd, lastly, what are the different circumstances which sometimes raise\nsome or all of these different parts of price above, and sometimes sink\nthem below, their natural or ordinary rate; or, what are the causes which\nsometimes hinder the market price, that is, the actual price of\ncommodities, from coinciding exactly with what may be called their natural\nprice.\nI shall endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly as I can, those\nthree subjects in the three following chapters, for which I must very\nearnestly entreat both the patience and attention of the reader: his\npatience, in order to examine a detail which may, perhaps, in some places,\nappear unnecessarily tedious; and his attention, in order to understand\nwhat may perhaps, after the fullest explication which I am capable of\ngiving it, appear still in some degree obscure. I am always willing to run\nsome hazard of being tedious, in order to be sure that I am perspicuous;\nand, after taking the utmost pains that I can to be perspicuous, some\nobscurity may still appear to remain upon a subject, in its own nature\nextremely abstracted.\nCHAPTER V.\nOF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF\nCOMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY.\nEvery man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford\nto enjoy the necessaries, conveniencies, and amusements of human life. But\nafter the division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a\nvery small part of these with which a man\u2019s own labour can supply him. The\nfar greater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people,\nand he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which\nhe can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any\ncommodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to\nuse or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is\nequal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or\ncommand. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value\nof all commodities.\nThe real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man\nwho wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What\nevery thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants\nto dispose of it, or exchange it for something else, is the toil and\ntrouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other\npeople. What is bought with money, or with goods, is purchased by labour,\nas much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money, or\nthose goods, indeed, save us this toil. They contain the value of a\ncertain quantity of labour, which we exchange for what is supposed at the\ntime to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first\nprice, the original purchase money that was paid for all things. It was\nnot by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world\nwas originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who\nwant to exchange it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the\nquantity of labour which it can enable them to purchase or command.\nWealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either acquires,\nor succeeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily acquire or succeed to\nany political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, perhaps,\nafford him the means of acquiring both; but the mere possession of that\nfortune does not necessarily convey to him either. The power which that\npossession immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of\npurchasing a certain command over all the labour, or over all the produce\nof labour which is then in the market. His fortune is greater or less,\nprecisely in proportion to the extent of this power, or to the quantity\neither of other men\u2019s labour, or, what is the same thing, of the produce\nof other men\u2019s labour, which it enables him to purchase or command. The\nexchangeable value of every thing must always be precisely equal to the\nextent of this power which it conveys to its owner.\nBut though labour be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all\ncommodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly estimated. It\nis often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different\nquantities of labour. The time spent in two different sorts of work will\nnot always alone determine this proportion. The different degrees of\nhardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise be taken into\naccount. There may be more labour in an hour\u2019s hard work, than in two\nhours easy business; or in an hour\u2019s application to a trade which it cost\nten years labour to learn, than in a month\u2019s industry, at an ordinary and\nobvious employment. But it is not easy to find any accurate measure either\nof hardship or ingenuity. In exchanging, indeed, the different productions\nof different sorts of labour for one another, some allowance is commonly\nmade for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but\nby the higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that sort of\nrough equality which, though not exact, is sufficient for carrying on the\nbusiness of common life.\nEvery commodity, besides, is more frequently exchanged for, and thereby\ncompared with, other commodities, than with labour. It is more natural,\ntherefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of some\nother commodity, than by that of the labour which it can produce. The\ngreater part of people, too, understand better what is meant by a quantity\nof a particular commodity, than by a quantity of labour. The one is a\nplain palpable object; the other an abstract notion, which though it can\nbe made sufficiently intelligible, is not altogether so natural and\nobvious.\nBut when barter ceases, and money has become the common instrument of\ncommerce, every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for\nmoney than for any other commodity. The butcher seldom carries his beef or\nhis mutton to the baker or the brewer, in order to exchange them for bread\nor for beer; but he carries them to the market, where he exchanges them\nfor money, and afterwards exchanges that money for bread and for beer. The\nquantity of money which he gets for them regulates, too, the quantity of\nbread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It is more natural and\nobvious to him, therefore, to estimate their value by the quantity of\nmoney, the commodity for which he immediately exchanges them, than by that\nof bread and beer, the commodities for which he can exchange them only by\nthe intervention of another commodity; and rather to say that his\nbutcher\u2019s meat is worth three-pence or fourpence a-pound, than that it is\nworth three or four pounds of bread, or three or four quarts of small\nbeer. Hence it comes to pass, that the exchangeable value of every\ncommodity is more frequently estimated by the quantity of money, than by\nthe quantity either of labour or of any other commodity which can be had\nin exchange for it.\nGold and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their value;\nare sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier and\nsometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labour which any\nparticular quantity of them can purchase or command, or the quantity of\nother goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the fertility\nor barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the time when\nsuch exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines of America,\nreduced, in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and silver in Europe\nto about a third of what it had been before. As it cost less labour to\nbring those metals from the mine to the market, so, when they were brought\nthither, they could purchase or command less labour; and this revolution\nin their value, though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the only one\nof which history gives some account. But as a measure of quantity, such as\nthe natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is continually varying in its\nown quantity, can never be an accurate measure of the quantity of other\nthings; so a commodity which is itself continually varying in its own\nvalue, can never be an accurate measure of the value of other commodities.\nEqual quantities of labour, at all times and places, may be said to be of\nequal value to the labourer. In his ordinary state of health, strength,\nand spirits; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity, he must\nalways lay down the same portion of his ease, his liberty, and his\nhappiness. The price which he pays must always be the same, whatever may\nbe the quantity of goods which he receives in return for it. Of these,\nindeed, it may sometimes purchase a greater and sometimes a smaller\nquantity; but it is their value which varies, not that of the labour which\npurchases them. At all times and places, that is dear which it is\ndifficult to come at, or which it costs much labour to acquire; and that\ncheap which is to be had easily, or with very little labour. Labour alone,\ntherefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real\nstandard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places\nbe estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal\nprice only.\nBut though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to the\nlabourer, yet to the person who employs him they appear sometimes to be of\ngreater, and sometimes of smaller value. He purchases them sometimes with\na greater, and sometimes with a smaller quantity of goods, and to him the\nprice of labour seems to vary like that of all other things. It appears to\nhim dear in the one case, and cheap in the other. In reality, however, it\nis the goods which are cheap in the one case, and dear in the other.\nIn this popular sense, therefore, labour, like commodities, may be said to\nhave a real and a nominal price. Its real price may be said to consist in\nthe quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are given\nfor it; its nominal price, in the quantity of money. The labourer is rich\nor poor, is well or ill rewarded, in proportion to the real, not to the\nnominal price of his labour.\nThe distinction between the real and the nominal price of commodities and\nlabour is not a matter of mere speculation, but may sometimes be of\nconsiderable use in practice. The same real price is always of the same\nvalue; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver,\nthe same nominal price is sometimes of very different values. When a\nlanded estate, therefore, is sold with a reservation of a perpetual rent,\nif it is intended that this rent should always be of the same value, it is\nof importance to the family in whose favour it is reserved, that it should\nnot consist in a particular sum of money. Its value would in this case be\nliable to variations of two different kinds: first, to those which arise\nfrom the different quantities of gold and silver which are contained at\ndifferent times in coin of the same denomination; and, secondly, to those\nwhich arise from the different values of equal quantities of gold and\nsilver at different times.\nPrinces and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a\ntemporary interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in\ntheir coins; but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment it.\nThe quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe of all nations,\nhas accordingly been almost continually diminishing, and hardly ever\naugmenting. Such variations, therefore, tend almost always to diminish the\nvalue of a money rent.\nThe discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold and\nsilver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly supposed, though I\napprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually, and is\nlikely to continue to do so for a long time. Upon this supposition,\ntherefore, such variations are more likely to diminish than to augment the\nvalue of a money rent, even though it should be stipulated to be paid, not\nin such a quantity of coined money of such a denomination (in so many\npounds sterling, for example), but in so many ounces, either of pure\nsilver, or of silver of a certain standard.\nThe rents which have been reserved in corn, have preserved their value\nmuch better than those which have been reserved in money, even where the\ndenomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Elizabeth,\nit was enacted, that a third of the rent of all college leases should be\nreserved in corn, to be paid either in kind, or according to the current\nprices at the nearest public market. The money arising from this corn\nrent, though originally but a third of the whole, is, in the present\ntimes, according to Dr Blackstone, commonly near double of what arises\nfrom the other two-thirds. The old money rents of colleges must, according\nto this account, have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value,\nor are worth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were\nformerly worth. But since the reign of Philip and Mary, the denomination\nof the English coin has undergone little or no alteration, and the same\nnumber of pounds, shillings, and pence, have contained very nearly the\nsame quantity of pure silver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of\nthe money rents of colleges, has arisen altogether from the degradation in\nthe price of silver.\nWhen the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the\ndiminution of the quantity of it contained in the coin of the same\ndenomination, the loss is frequently still greater. In Scotland, where the\ndenomination of the coin has undergone much greater alterations than it\never did in England, and in France, where it has undergone still greater\nthan it ever did in Scotland, some ancient rents, originally of\nconsiderable value, have, in this manner, been reduced almost to nothing.\nEqual quantities of labour will, at distant times, be purchased more\nnearly with equal quantities of corn, the subsistence of the labourer,\nthan with equal quantities of gold and silver, or, perhaps, of any other\ncommodity. Equal quantities of corn, therefore, will, at distant times, be\nmore nearly of the same real value, or enable the possessor to purchase or\ncommand more nearly the same quantity of the labour of other people. They\nwill do this, I say, more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other\ncommodity; for even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The\nsubsistence of the labourer, or the real price of labour, as I shall\nendeavour to shew hereafter, is very different upon different occasions;\nmore liberal in a society advancing to opulence, than in one that is\nstanding still, and in one that is standing still, than in one that is\ngoing backwards. Every other commodity, however, will, at any particular\ntime, purchase a greater or smaller quantity of labour, in proportion to\nthe quantity of subsistence which it can purchase at that time. A rent,\ntherefore, reserved in corn, is liable only to the variations in the\nquantity of labour which a certain quantity of corn can purchase. But a\nrent reserved in any other commodity is liable, not only to the variations\nin the quantity of labour which any particular quantity of corn can\npurchase, but to the variations in the quantity of corn which can be\npurchased by any particular quantity of that commodity.\nThough the real value of a corn rent, it is to be observed, however,\nvaries much less from century to century than that of a money rent, it\nvaries much more from year to year. The money price of labour, as I shall\nendeavour to shew hereafter, does not fluctuate from year to year with the\nmoney price of corn, but seems to be everywhere accommodated, not to the\ntemporary or occasional, but to the average or ordinary price of that\nnecessary of life. The average or ordinary price of corn, again is\nregulated, as I shall likewise endeavour to shew hereafter, by the value\nof silver, by the richness or barrenness of the mines which supply the\nmarket with that metal, or by the quantity of labour which must be\nemployed, and consequently of corn which must be consumed, in order to\nbring any particular quantity of silver from the mine to the market. But\nthe value of silver, though it sometimes varies greatly from century to\ncentury, seldom varies much from year to year, but frequently continues\nthe same, or very nearly the same, for half a century or a century\ntogether. The ordinary or average money price of corn, therefore, may,\nduring so long a period, continue the same, or very nearly the same, too,\nand along with it the money price of labour, provided, at least, the\nsociety continues, in other respects, in the same, or nearly in the same,\ncondition. In the mean time, the temporary and occasional price of corn\nmay frequently be double one year of what it had been the year before, or\nfluctuate, for example, from five-and-twenty to fifty shillings the\nquarter. But when corn is at the latter price, not only the nominal, but\nthe real value of a corn rent, will be double of what it is when at the\nformer, or will command double the quantity either of labour, or of the\ngreater part of other commodities; the money price of labour, and along\nwith it that of most other things, continuing the same during all these\nfluctuations.\nLabour, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well as\nthe only accurate, measure of value, or the only standard by which we can\ncompare the values of different commodities, at all times, and at all\nplaces. We cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different\ncommodities from century to century by the quantities of silver which were\ngiven for them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities\nof corn. By the quantities of labour, we can, with the greatest accuracy,\nestimate it, both from century to century, and from year to year. From\ncentury to century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from\ncentury to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same\nquantity of labour more nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year\nto year, on the contrary, silver is a better measure than corn, because\nequal quantities of it will more nearly command the same quantity of\nlabour.\nBut though, in establishing perpetual rents, or even in letting very long\nleases, it may be of use to distinguish between real and nominal price; it\nis of none in buying and selling, the more common and ordinary\ntransactions of human life.\nAt the same time and place, the real and the nominal price of all\ncommodities are exactly in proportion to one another. The more or less\nmoney you get for any commodity, in the London market, for example, the\nmore or less labour it will at that time and place enable you to purchase\nor command. At the same time and place, therefore, money is the exact\nmeasure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. It is so,\nhowever, at the same time and place only.\nThough at distant places there is no regular proportion between the real\nand the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who carries goods\nfrom the one to the other, has nothing to consider but the money price, or\nthe difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys them, and\nthat for which he is likely to sell them. Half an ounce of silver at\nCanton in China may command a greater quantity both of labour and of the\nnecessaries and conveniencies of life, than an ounce at London. A\ncommodity, therefore, which sells for half an ounce of silver at Canton,\nmay there be really dearer, of more real importance to the man who\npossesses it there, than a commodity which sells for an ounce at London is\nto the man who possesses it at London. If a London merchant, however, can\nbuy at Canton, for half an ounce of silver, a commodity which he can\nafterwards sell at London for an ounce, he gains a hundred per cent. by\nthe bargain, just as much as if an ounce of silver was at London exactly\nof the same value as at Canton. It is of no importance to him that half an\nounce of silver at Canton would have given him the command of more labour,\nand of a greater quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life\nthan an ounce can do at London. An ounce at London will always give him\nthe command of double the quantity of all these, which half an ounce could\nhave done there, and this is precisely what he wants.\nAs it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally\ndetermines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and sales, and\nthereby regulates almost the whole business of common life in which price\nis concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more\nattended to than the real price.\nIn such a work as this, however, it may sometimes be of use to compare the\ndifferent real values of a particular commodity at different times and\nplaces, or the different degrees of power over the labour of other people\nwhich it may, upon different occasions, have given to those who possessed\nit. We must in this case compare, not so much the different quantities of\nsilver for which it was commonly sold, as the different quantities or\nlabour which those different quantities of silver could have purchased.\nBut the current prices of labour, at distant times and places, can scarce\never be known with any degree of exactness. Those of corn, though they\nhave in few places been regularly recorded, are in general better known,\nand have been more frequently taken notice of by historians and other\nwriters. We must generally, therefore, content ourselves with them, not as\nbeing always exactly in the same proportion as the current prices of\nlabour, but as being the nearest approximation which can commonly be had\nto that proportion. I shall hereafter have occasion to make several\ncomparisons of this kind.\nIn the progress of industry, commercial nations have found it convenient\nto coin several different metals into money; gold for larger payments,\nsilver for purchases of moderate value, and copper, or some other coarse\nmetal, for those of still smaller consideration, They have always,\nhowever, considered one of those metals as more peculiarly the measure of\nvalue than any of the other two; and this preference seems generally to\nhave been given to the metal which they happen first to make use of as the\ninstrument of commerce. Having once begun to use it as their standard,\nwhich they must have done when they had no other money, they have\ngenerally continued to do so even when the necessity was not the same.\nThe Romans are said to have had nothing but copper money till within five\nyears before the first Punic war (Pliny, lib. xxxiii. cap. 3), when they\nfirst began to coin silver. Copper, therefore, appears to have continued\nalways the measure of value in that republic. At Rome all accounts appear\nto have been kept, and the value of all estates to have been computed,\neither in asses or in sestertii. The as was always the denomination of a\ncopper coin. The word sestertius signifies two asses and a half. Though\nthe sestertius, therefore, was originally a silver coin, its value was\nestimated in copper. At Rome, one who owed a great deal of money was said\nto have a great deal of other people\u2019s copper.\nThe northern nations who established themselves upon the ruins of the\nRoman empire, seem to have had silver money from the first beginning of\ntheir settlements, and not to have known either gold or copper coins for\nseveral ages thereafter. There were silver coins in England in the time of\nthe Saxons; but there was little gold coined till the time of Edward III\nnor any copper till that of James I. of Great Britain. In England,\ntherefore, and for the same reason, I believe, in all other modern nations\nof Europe, all accounts are kept, and the value of all goods and of all\nestates is generally computed, in silver: and when we mean to express the\namount of a person\u2019s fortune, we seldom mention the number of guineas, but\nthe number of pounds sterling which we suppose would be given for it.\nOriginally, in all countries, I believe, a legal tender of payment could\nbe made only in the coin of that metal which was peculiarly considered as\nthe standard or measure of value. In England, gold was not considered as a\nlegal tender for a long time after it was coined into money. The\nproportion between the values of gold and silver money was not fixed by\nany public law or proclamation, but was left to be settled by the market.\nIf a debtor offered payment in gold, the creditor might either reject such\npayment altogether, or accept of it at such a valuation of the gold as he\nand his debtor could agree upon. Copper is not at present a legal tender,\nexcept in the change of the smaller silver coins.\nIn this state of things, the distinction between the metal which was the\nstandard, and that which was not the standard, was something more than a\nnominal distinction.\nIn process of time, and as people became gradually more familiar with the\nuse of the different metals in coin, and consequently better acquainted\nwith the proportion between their respective values, it has, in most\ncountries, I believe, been found convenient to ascertain this proportion,\nand to declare by a public law, that a guinea, for example, of such a\nweight and fineness, should exchange for one-and-twenty shillings, or be a\nlegal tender for a debt of that amount. In this state of things, and\nduring the continuance of any one regulated proportion of this kind, the\ndistinction between the metal, which is the standard, and that which is\nnot the standard, becomes little more than a nominal distinction.\nIn consequence of any change, however, in this regulated proportion, this\ndistinction becomes, or at least seems to become, something more than\nnominal again. If the regulated value of a guinea, for example, was either\nreduced to twenty, or raised to two-and-twenty shillings, all accounts\nbeing kept, and almost all obligations for debt being expressed, in silver\nmoney, the greater part of payments could in either case be made with the\nsame quantity of silver money as before; but would require very different\nquantities of gold money; a greater in the one case, and a smaller in the\nother. Silver would appear to be more invariable in its value than gold.\nSilver would appear to measure the value of gold, and gold would not\nappear to measure the value of silver. The value of gold would seem to\ndepend upon the quantity of silver which it would exchange for, and the\nvalue of silver would not seem to depend upon the quantity of gold which\nit would exchange for. This difference, however, would be altogether owing\nto the custom of keeping accounts, and of expressing the amount of all\ngreat and small sums rather in silver than in gold money. One of Mr\nDrummond\u2019s notes for five-and-twenty or fifty guineas would, after an\nalteration of this kind, be still payable with five-and-twenty or fifty\nguineas, in the same manner as before. It would, after such an alteration,\nbe payable with the same quantity of gold as before, but with very\ndifferent quantities of silver. In the payment of such a note, gold would\nappear to be more invariable in its value than silver. Gold would appear\nto measure the value of silver, and silver would not appear to measure the\nvalue of gold. If the custom of keeping accounts, and of expressing\npromissory-notes and other obligations for money, in this manner should\never become general, gold, and not silver, would be considered as the\nmetal which was peculiarly the standard or measure of value.\nIn reality, during the continuance of any one regulated proportion between\nthe respective values of the different metals in coin, the value of the\nmost precious metal regulates the value of the whole coin. Twelve copper\npence contain half a pound avoirdupois of copper, of not the best quality,\nwhich, before it is coined, is seldom worth seven-pence in silver. But as,\nby the regulation, twelve such pence are ordered to exchange for a\nshilling, they are in the market considered as worth a shilling, and a\nshilling can at any time be had for them. Even before the late reformation\nof the gold coin of Great Britain, the gold, that part of it at least\nwhich circulated in London and its neighbourhood, was in general less\ndegraded below its standard weight than the greater part of the silver.\nOne-and-twenty worn and defaced shillings, however, were considered as\nequivalent to a guinea, which, perhaps, indeed, was worn and defaced too,\nbut seldom so much so. The late regulations have brought the gold coin as\nnear, perhaps, to its standard weight as it is possible to bring the\ncurrent coin of any nation; and the order to receive no gold at the public\noffices but by weight, is likely to preserve it so, as long as that order\nis enforced. The silver coin still continues in the same worn and degraded\nstate as before the reformation of the cold coin. In the market, however,\none-and-twenty shillings of this degraded silver coin are still considered\nas worth a guinea of this excellent gold coin.\nThe reformation of the gold coin has evidently raised the value of the\nsilver coin which can be exchanged for it.\nIn the English mint, a pound weight of gold is coined into forty-four\nguineas and a half, which at one-and-twenty shillings the guinea, is equal\nto forty-six pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence. An ounce of such gold\ncoin, therefore, is worth \u00a3 3:17:10\u00bd in silver. In England, no duty or\nseignorage is paid upon the coinage, and he who carries a pound weight or\nan ounce weight of standard gold bullion to the mint, gets back a pound\nweight or an ounce weight of gold in coin, without any deduction. Three\npounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny an ounce, therefore, is\nsaid to be the mint price of gold in England, or the quantity of gold coin\nwhich the mint gives in return for standard gold bullion.\nBefore the reformation of the gold coin, the price of standard gold\nbullion in the market had, for many years, been upwards of \u00a33:18s.\nsometimes \u00a3 3:19s, and very frequently \u00a34 an ounce; that sum, it is\nprobable, in the worn and degraded gold coin, seldom containing more than\nan ounce of standard gold. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the\nmarket price of standard gold bullion seldom exceeds \u00a3 3:17:7 an ounce.\nBefore the reformation of the gold coin, the market price was always more\nor less above the mint price. Since that reformation, the market price has\nbeen constantly below the mint price. But that market price is the same\nwhether it is paid in gold or in silver coin. The late reformation of the\ngold coin, therefore, has raised not only the value of the gold coin, but\nlikewise that of the silver coin in proportion to gold bullion, and\nprobably, too, in proportion to all other commodities; though the price of\nthe greater part of other commodities being influenced by so many other\ncauses, the rise in the value of either gold or silver coin in proportion\nto them may not be so distinct and sensible.\nIn the English mint, a pound weight of standard silver bullion is coined\ninto sixty-two shillings, containing, in the same manner, a pound weight\nof standard silver. Five shillings and twopence an ounce, therefore, is\nsaid to be the mint price of silver in England, or the quantity of silver\ncoin which the mint gives in return for standard silver bullion. Before\nthe reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard silver\nbullion was, upon different occasions, five shillings and fourpence, five\nshillings and fivepence, five shillings and sixpence, five shillings and\nsevenpence, and very often five shillings and eightpence an ounce. Five\nshillings and sevenpence, however, seems to have been the most common\nprice. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of\nstandard silver bullion has fallen occasionally to five shillings and\nthreepence, five shillings and fourpence, and five shillings and fivepence\nan ounce, which last price it has scarce ever exceeded. Though the market\nprice of silver bullion has fallen considerably since the reformation of\nthe gold coin, it has not fallen so low as the mint price.\nIn the proportion between the different metals in the English coin, as\ncopper is rated very much above its real value, so silver is rated\nsomewhat below it. In the market of Europe, in the French coin and in the\nDutch coin, an ounce of fine gold exchanges for about fourteen ounces of\nfine silver. In the English coin, it exchanges for about fifteen ounces,\nthat is, for more silver than it is worth, according to the common\nestimation of Europe. But as the price of copper in bars is not, even in\nEngland, raised by the high price of copper in English coin, so the price\nof silver in bullion is not sunk by the low rate of silver in English\ncoin. Silver in bullion still preserves its proper proportion to gold, for\nthe same reason that copper in bars preserves its proper proportion to\nsilver.\nUpon the reformation of the silver coin, in the reign of William III., the\nprice of silver bullion still continued to be somewhat above the mint\nprice. Mr Locke imputed this high price to the permission of exporting\nsilver bullion, and to the prohibition of exporting silver coin. This\npermission of exporting, he said, rendered the demand for silver bullion\ngreater than the demand for silver coin. But the number of people who want\nsilver coin for the common uses of buying and selling at home, is surely\nmuch greater than that of those who want silver bullion either for the use\nof exportation or for any other use. There subsists at present a like\npermission of exporting gold bullion, and a like prohibition of exporting\ngold coin; and yet the price of gold bullion has fallen below the mint\nprice. But in the English coin, silver was then, in the same manner as\nnow, under-rated in proportion to gold; and the gold coin (which at that\ntime, too, was not supposed to require any reformation) regulated then, as\nwell as now, the real value of the whole coin. As the reformation of the\nsilver coin did not then reduce the price of silver bullion to the mint\nprice, it is not very probable that a like reformation will do so now.\nWere the silver coin brought back as near to its standard weight as the\ngold, a guinea, it is probable, would, according to the present\nproportion, exchange for more silver in coin than it would purchase in\nbullion. The silver coin containing its full standard weight, there would\nin this case, be a profit in melting it down, in order, first to sell the\nbullion for gold coin, and afterwards to exchange this gold coin for\nsilver coin, to be melted down in the same manner. Some alteration in the\npresent proportion seems to be the only method of preventing this\ninconveniency.\nThe inconveniency, perhaps, would be less, if silver was rated in the coin\nas much above its proper proportion to gold as it is at present rated\nbelow it, provided it was at the same time enacted, that silver should not\nbe a legal tender for more than the change of a guinea, in the same manner\nas copper is not a legal tender for more than the change of a shilling. No\ncreditor could, in this case, be cheated in consequence of the high\nvaluation of silver in coin; as no creditor can at present be cheated in\nconsequence of the high valuation of copper. The bankers only would suffer\nby this regulation. When a run comes upon them, they sometimes endeavour\nto gain time, by paying in sixpences, and they would be precluded by this\nregulation from this discreditable method of evading immediate payment.\nThey would be obliged, in consequence, to keep at all times in their\ncoffers a greater quantity of cash than at present; and though this might,\nno doubt, be a considerable inconveniency to them, it would, at the same\ntime, be a considerable security to their creditors.\nThree pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny (the mint price of\ngold) certainly does not contain, even in our present excellent gold coin,\nmore than an ounce of standard gold, and it may be thought, therefore,\nshould not purchase more standard bullion. But gold in coin is more\nconvenient than gold in bullion; and though, in England, the coinage is\nfree, yet the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint, can seldom be\nreturned in coin to the owner till after a delay of several weeks. In the\npresent hurry of the mint, it could not be returned till after a delay of\nseveral months. This delay is equivalent to a small duty, and renders gold\nin coin somewhat more valuable than an equal quantity of gold in bullion.\nIf, in the English coin, silver was rated according to its proper\nproportion to gold, the price of silver bullion would probably fall below\nthe mint price, even without any reformation of the silver coin; the value\neven of the present worn and defaced silver coin being regulated by the\nvalue of the excellent gold coin for which it can be changed.\nA small seignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and silver, would\nprobably increase still more the superiority of those metals in coin above\nan equal quantity of either of them in bullion. The coinage would, in this\ncase, increase the value of the metal coined in proportion to the extent\nof this small duty, for the same reason that the fashion increases the\nvalue of plate in proportion to the price of that fashion. The superiority\nof coin above bullion would prevent the melting down of the coin, and\nwould discourage its exportation. If, upon any public exigency, it should\nbecome necessary to export the coin, the greater part of it would soon\nreturn again, of its own accord. Abroad, it could sell only for its weight\nin bullion. At home, it would buy more than that weight. There would be a\nprofit, therefore, in bringing it home again. In France, a seignorage of\nabout eight per cent. is imposed upon the coinage, and the French coin,\nwhen exported, is said to return home again, of its own accord.\nThe occasional fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver bullion\narise from the same causes as the like fluctuations in that of all other\ncommodities. The frequent loss of those metals from various accidents by\nsea and by land, the continual waste of them in gilding and plating, in\nlace and embroidery, in the wear and tear of coin, and in that of plate,\nrequire, in all countries which possess no mines of their own, a continual\nimportation, in order to repair this loss and this waste. The merchant\nimporters, like all other merchants, we may believe, endeavour, as well as\nthey can, to suit their occasional importations to what they judge is\nlikely to be the immediate demand. With all their attention, however, they\nsometimes overdo the business, and sometimes underdo it. When they import\nmore bullion than is wanted, rather than incur the risk and trouble of\nexporting it again, they are sometimes willing to sell a part of it for\nsomething less than the ordinary or average price. When, on the other\nhand, they import less than is wanted, they get something more than this\nprice. But when, under all those occasional fluctuations, the market price\neither of gold or silver bullion continues for several years together\nsteadily and constantly, either more or less above, or more or less below\nthe mint price, we may be assured that this steady and constant, either\nsuperiority or inferiority of price, is the effect of something in the\nstate of the coin, which, at that time, renders a certain quantity of coin\neither of more value or of less value than the precise quantity of bullion\nwhich it ought to contain. The constancy and steadiness of the effect\nsupposes a proportionable constancy and steadiness in the cause.\nThe money of any particular country is, at any particular time and place,\nmore or less an accurate measure or value, according as the current coin\nis more or less exactly agreeable to its standard, or contains more or\nless exactly the precise quantity of pure gold or pure silver which it\nought to contain. If in England, for example, forty-four guineas and a\nhalf contained exactly a pound weight of standard gold, or eleven ounces\nof fine gold, and one ounce of alloy, the gold coin of England would be as\naccurate a measure of the actual value of goods at any particular time and\nplace as the nature of the thing would admit. But if, by rubbing and\nwearing, forty-four guineas and a half generally contain less than a pound\nweight of standard gold, the diminution, however, being greater in some\npieces than in others, the measure of value comes to be liable to the same\nsort of uncertainty to which all other weights and measures are commonly\nexposed. As it rarely happens that these are exactly agreeable to their\nstandard, the merchant adjusts the price of his goods as well as he can,\nnot to what those weights and measures ought to be, but to what, upon an\naverage, he finds, by experience, they actually are. In consequence of a\nlike disorder in the coin, the price of goods comes, in the same manner,\nto be adjusted, not to the quantity of pure gold or silver which the coin\nought to contain, but to that which, upon an average, it is found, by\nexperience, it actually does contain.\nBy the money price of goods, it is to be observed, I understand always the\nquantity of pure gold or silver for which they are sold, without any\nregard to the denomination of the coin. Six shillings and eight pence, for\nexample, in the time of Edward I., I consider as the same money price with\na pound sterling in the present times, because it contained, as nearly as\nwe can judge, the same quantity of pure silver.\nCHAPTER VI.\nOF THE COMPONENT PART OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES.\nIn that early and rude state of society which precedes both the\naccumulation of stock and the appropriation of land, the proportion\nbetween the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different\nobjects, seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for\nexchanging them for one another. If among a nation of hunters, for\nexample, it usually costs twice the labour to kill a beaver which it does\nto kill a deer, one beaver should naturally exchange for or be worth two\ndeer. It is natural that what is usually the produce of two days or two\nhours labour, should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one\nday\u2019s or one hour\u2019s labour.\nIf the one species of labour should be more severe than the other, some\nallowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship; and the\nproduce of one hour\u2019s labour in the one way may frequently exchange for\nthat of two hour\u2019s labour in the other.\nOr if the one species of labour requires an uncommon degree of dexterity\nand ingenuity, the esteem which men have for such talents, will naturally\ngive a value to their produce, superior to what would be due to the time\nemployed about it. Such talents can seldom be acquired but in consequence\nof long application, and the superior value of their produce may\nfrequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time and\nlabour which must be spent in acquiring them. In the advanced state of\nsociety, allowances of this kind, for superior hardship and superior\nskill, are commonly made in the wages of labour; and something of the same\nkind must probably have taken place in its earliest and rudest period.\nIn this state of things, the whole produce of labour belongs to the\nlabourer; and the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or\nproducing any commodity, is the only circumstance which can regulate the\nquantity of labour which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or\nexchange for.\nAs soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some\nof them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people,\nwhom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to make a\nprofit by the sale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the\nvalue of the materials. In exchanging the complete manufacture either for\nmoney, for labour, or for other goods, over and above what may be\nsufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the\nworkmen, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker of the\nwork, who hazards his stock in this adventure. The value which the workmen\nadd to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into two\nparts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits of their\nemployer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he advanced. He\ncould have no interest to employ them, unless he expected from the sale of\ntheir work something more than what was sufficient to replace his stock to\nhim; and he could have no interest to employ a great stock rather than a\nsmall one, unless his profits were to bear some proportion to the extent\nof his stock.\nThe profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought, are only a different name\nfor the wages of a particular sort of labour, the labour of inspection and\ndirection. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated by quite\ndifferent principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the\nhardship, or the ingenuity of this supposed labour of inspection and\ndirection. They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock\nemployed, and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this\nstock. Let us suppose, for example, that in some particular place, where\nthe common annual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent. there\nare two different manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen are\nemployed, at the rate of fifteen pounds a year each, or at the expense of\nthree hundred a-year in each manufactory. Let us suppose, too, that the\ncoarse materials annually wrought up in the one cost only seven hundred\npounds, while the finer materials in the other cost seven thousand. The\ncapital annually employed in the one will, in this case, amount only to\none thousand pounds; whereas that employed in the other will amount to\nseven thousand three hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per cent.\ntherefore, the undertaker of the one will expect a yearly profit of about\none hundred pounds only; while that of the other will expect about seven\nhundred and thirty pounds. But though their profits are so very different,\ntheir labour of inspection and direction may be either altogether or very\nnearly the same. In many great works, almost the whole labour of this kind\nis committed to some principal clerk. His wages properly express the value\nof this labour of inspection and direction. Though in settling them some\nregard is had commonly, not only to his labour and skill, but to the trust\nwhich is reposed in him, yet they never bear any regular proportion to the\ncapital of which he oversees the management; and the owner of this\ncapital, though he is thus discharged of almost all labour, still expects\nthat his profit should bear a regular proportion to his capital. In the\nprice of commodities, therefore, the profits of stock constitute a\ncomponent part altogether different from the wages of labour, and\nregulated by quite different principles.\nIn this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always\nbelong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of\nthe stock which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labour commonly\nemployed in acquiring or producing any commodity, the only circumstance\nwhich can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase,\ncommand or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be\ndue for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished\nthe materials of that labour.\nAs soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the\nlandlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and\ndemand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the\ngrass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when\nland was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them,\ncome, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must\nthen pay for the licence to gather them, and must give up to the landlord\na portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion,\nor, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes\nthe rent of land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities,\nmakes a third component part.\nThe real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be\nobserved, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of\nthem, purchase or command. Labour measures the value, not only of that\npart of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which\nresolves itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.\nIn every society, the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\ninto some one or other, or all of those three parts; and in every improved\nsociety, all the three enter, more or less, as component parts, into the\nprice of the far greater part of commodities.\nIn the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of the landlord,\nanother pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring\ncattle employed in producing it, and the third pays the profit of the\nfarmer. These three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up\nthe whole price of corn. A fourth part, it may perhaps be thought is\nnecessary for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the\nwear and tear of his labouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry.\nBut it must be considered, that the price of any instrument of husbandry,\nsuch as a labouring horse, is itself made up of the same time parts; the\nrent of the land upon which he is reared, the labour of tending and\nrearing him, and the profits of the farmer, who advances both the rent of\nthis land, and the wages of this labour. Though the price of the corn,\ntherefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the\nwhole price still resolves itself, either immediately or ultimately, into\nthe same three parts of rent, labour, and profit.\nIn the price of flour or meal, we must add to the price of the corn, the\nprofits of the miller, and the wages of his servants; in the price of\nbread, the profits of the baker, and the wages of his servants; and in the\nprice of both, the labour of transporting the corn from the house of the\nfarmer to that of the miller, and from that of the miller to that of the\nbaker, together with the profits of those who advance the wages of that\nlabour.\nThe price of flax resolves itself into the same three parts as that of\ncorn. In the price of linen we must add to this price the wages of the\nflax-dresser, of the spinner, of the weaver, of the bleacher, etc.\ntogether with the profits of their respective employers.\nAs any particular commodity comes to be more manufactured, that part of\nthe price which resolves itself into wages and profit, comes to be greater\nin proportion to that which resolves itself into rent. In the progress of\nthe manufacture, not only the number of profits increase, but every\nsubsequent profit is greater than the foregoing; because the capital from\nwhich it is derived must always be greater. The capital which employs the\nweavers, for example, must be greater than that which employs the\nspinners; because it not only replaces that capital with its profits, but\npays, besides, the wages of the weavers: and the profits must always bear\nsome proportion to the capital.\nIn the most improved societies, however, there are always a few\ncommodities of which the price resolves itself into two parts only: the\nwages of labour, and the profits of stock; and a still smaller number, in\nwhich it consists altogether in the wages of labour. In the price of\nsea-fish, for example, one part pays the labour of the fisherman, and the\nother the profits of the capital employed in the fishery. Rent very seldom\nmakes any part of it, though it does sometimes, as I shall shew hereafter.\nIt is otherwise, at least through the greater part of Europe, in river\nfisheries. A salmon fishery pays a rent; and rent, though it cannot well\nbe called the rent of land, makes a part of the price of a salmon, as well\nas wares and profit. In some parts of Scotland, a few poor people make a\ntrade of gathering, along the sea-shore, those little variegated stones\ncommonly known by the name of Scotch pebbles. The price which is paid to\nthem by the stone-cutter, is altogether the wages of their labour; neither\nrent nor profit makes any part of it.\nBut the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself\ninto some one or other or all of those three parts; as whatever part of it\nremains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole\nlabour employed in raising, manufacturing, and bringing it to market, must\nnecessarily be profit to somebody.\nAs the price or exchangeable value of every particular commodity, taken\nseparately, resolves itself into some one or other, or all of those three\nparts; so that of all the commodities which compose the whole annual\nproduce of the labour of every country, taken complexly, must resolve\nitself into the same three parts, and be parcelled out among different\ninhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their labour, the\nprofits of their stock, or the rent of their land. The whole of what is\nannually either collected or produced by the labour of every society, or,\nwhat comes to the same thing, the whole price of it, is in this manner\noriginally distributed among some of its different members. Wages, profit,\nand rent, are the three original sources of all revenue, as well as of all\nexchangeable value. All other revenue is ultimately derived from some one\nor other of these.\nWhoever derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, must draw it\neither from his labour, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue\nderived from labour is called wages; that derived from stock, by the\nperson who manages or employs it, is called profit; that derived from it\nby the person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is\ncalled the interest or the use of money. It is the compensation which the\nborrower pays to the lender, for the profit which he has an opportunity of\nmaking by the use of the money. Part of that profit naturally belongs to\nthe borrower, who runs the risk and takes the trouble of employing it, and\npart to the lender, who affords him the opportunity of making this profit.\nThe interest of money is always a derivative revenue, which, if it is not\npaid from the profit which is made by the use of the money, must be paid\nfrom some other source of revenue, unless perhaps the borrower is a\nspendthrift, who contracts a second debt in order to pay the interest of\nthe first. The revenue which proceeds altogether from land, is called\nrent, and belongs to the landlord. The revenue of the farmer is derived\npartly from his labour, and partly from his stock. To him, land is only\nthe instrument which enables him to earn the wages of this labour, and to\nmake the profits of this stock. All taxes, and all the revenue which is\nfounded upon them, all salaries, pensions, and annuities of every kind,\nare ultimately derived from some one or other of those three original\nsources of revenue, and are paid either immediately or mediately from the\nwages of labour, the profits of stock, or the rent of land.\nWhen those three different sorts of revenue belong to different persons,\nthey are readily distinguished; but when they belong to the same, they are\nsometimes confounded with one another, at least in common language.\nA gentleman who farms a part of his own estate, after paying the expense\nof cultivation, should gain both the rent of the landlord and the profit\nof the farmer. He is apt to denominate, however, his whole gain, profit,\nand thus confounds rent with profit, at least in common language. The\ngreater part of our North American and West Indian planters are in this\nsituation. They farm, the greater part of them, their own estates: and\naccordingly we seldom hear of the rent of a plantation, but frequently of\nits profit.\nCommon farmers seldom employ any overseer to direct the general operations\nof the farm. They generally, too, work a good deal with their own hands,\nas ploughmen, harrowers, etc. What remains of the crop, after paying the\nrent, therefore, should not only replace to them their stock employed in\ncultivation, together with its ordinary profits, but pay them the wages\nwhich are due to them, both as labourers and overseers. Whatever remains,\nhowever, after paying the rent and keeping up the stock, is called profit.\nBut wages evidently make a part of it. The farmer, by saving these wages,\nmust necessarily gain them. Wages, therefore, are in this case confounded\nwith profit.\nAn independent manufacturer, who has stock enough both to purchase\nmaterials, and to maintain himself till he can carry his work to market,\nshould gain both the wages of a journeyman who works under a master, and\nthe profit which that master makes by the sale of that journeyman\u2019s work.\nHis whole gains, however, are commonly called profit, and wages are, in\nthis case, too, confounded with profit.\nA gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands, unites in his\nown person the three different characters, of landlord, farmer, and\nlabourer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of the first,\nthe profit of the second, and the wages of the third. The whole, however,\nis commonly considered as the earnings of his labour. Both rent and profit\nare, in this case, confounded with wages.\nAs in a civilized country there are but few commodities of which the\nexchangeable value arises from labour only, rent and profit contributing\nlargely to that of the far greater part of them, so the annual produce of\nits labour will always be sufficient to purchase or command a much greater\nquantity of labour than what was employed in raising, preparing, and\nbringing that produce to market. If the society were annually to employ\nall the labour which it can annually purchase, as the quantity of labour\nwould increase greatly every year, so the produce of every succeeding year\nwould be of vastly greater value than that of the foregoing. But there is\nno country in which the whole annual produce is employed in maintaining\nthe industrious. The idle everywhere consume a great part of it; and,\naccording to the different proportions in which it is annually divided\nbetween those two different orders of people, its ordinary or average\nvalue must either annually increase or diminish, or continue the same from\none year to another.\nCHAPTER VII.\nOF THE NATURAL AND MARKET PRICE OF COMMODITIES.\nThere is in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average rate,\nboth of wages and profit, in every different employment of labour and\nstock. This rate is naturally regulated, as I shall shew hereafter, partly\nby the general circumstances of the society, their riches or poverty,\ntheir advancing, stationary, or declining condition, and partly by the\nparticular nature of each employment.\nThere is likewise in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average\nrate of rent, which is regulated, too, as I shall shew hereafter, partly\nby the general circumstances of the society or neighbourhood in which the\nland is situated, and partly by the natural or improved fertility of the\nland.\nThese ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates of wages,\nprofit and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly prevail.\nWhen the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what is\nsufficient to pay the rent of the land, the wages of the labour, and the\nprofits of the stock employed in raising, preparing, and bringing it to\nmarket, according to their natural rates, the commodity is then sold for\nwhat may be called its natural price.\nThe commodity is then sold precisely for what it is worth, or for what it\nreally costs the person who brings it to market; for though, in common\nlanguage, what is called the prime cost of any commodity does not\ncomprehend the profit of the person who is to sell it again, yet, if he\nsells it at a price which does not allow him the ordinary rate of profit\nin his neighbourhood, he is evidently a loser by the trade; since, by\nemploying his stock in some other way, he might have made that profit. His\nprofit, besides, is his revenue, the proper fund of his subsistence. As,\nwhile he is preparing and bringing the goods to market, he advances to his\nworkmen their wages, or their subsistence; so he advances to himself, in\nthe same manner, his own subsistence, which is generally suitable to the\nprofit which he may reasonably expect from the sale of his goods. Unless\nthey yield him this profit, therefore, they do not repay him what they may\nvery properly be said to have really cost him.\nThough the price, therefore, which leaves him this profit, is not always\nthe lowest at which a dealer may sometimes sell his goods, it is the\nlowest at which he is likely to sell them for any considerable time; at\nleast where there is perfect liberty, or where he may change his trade as\noften as he pleases.\nThe actual price at which any commodity is commonly sold, is called its\nmarket price. It may either be above, or below, or exactly the same with\nits natural price.\nThe market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the\nproportion between the quantity which is actually brought to market, and\nthe demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price of the\ncommodity, or the whole value of the rent, labour, and profit, which must\nbe paid in order to bring it thither. Such people may be called the\neffectual demanders, and their demand the effectual demand; since it maybe\nsufficient to effectuate the bringing of the commodity to market. It is\ndifferent from the absolute demand. A very poor man may be said, in some\nsense, to have a demand for a coach and six; he might like to have it; but\nhis demand is not an effectual demand, as the commodity can never be\nbrought to market in order to satisfy it.\nWhen the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short\nof the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay the whole value\nof the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it\nthither, cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want. Rather than\nwant it altogether, some of them will be willing to give more. A\ncompetition will immediately begin among them, and the market price will\nrise more or less above the natural price, according as either the\ngreatness of the deficiency, or the wealth and wanton luxury of the\ncompetitors, happen to animate more or less the eagerness of the\ncompetition. Among competitors of equal wealth and luxury, the same\ndeficiency will generally occasion a more or less eager competition,\naccording as the acquisition of the commodity happens to be of more or\nless importance to them. Hence the exorbitant price of the necessaries of\nlife during the blockade of a town, or in a famine.\nWhen the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand, it\ncannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the\nrent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither.\nSome part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less, and the low\nprice which they give for it must reduce the price of the whole. The\nmarket price will sink more or less below the natural price, according as\nthe greatness of the excess increases more or less the competition of the\nsellers, or according as it happens to be more or less important to them\nto get immediately rid of the commodity. The same excess in the\nimportation of perishable, will occasion a much greater competition than\nin that of durable commodities; in the importation of oranges, for\nexample, than in that of old iron.\nWhen the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the\neffectual demand, and no more, the market price naturally comes to be\neither exactly, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with the\nnatural price. The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this\nprice, and can not be disposed of for more. The competition of the\ndifferent dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not\noblige them to accept of less.\nThe quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits itself\nto the effectual demand. It is the interest of all those who employ their\nland, labour, or stock, in bringing any commodity to market, that the\nquantity never should exceed the effectual demand; and it is the interest\nof all other people that it never should fall short of that demand.\nIf at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, some of the component\nparts of its price must be paid below their natural rate. If it is rent,\nthe interest of the landlords will immediately prompt them to withdraw a\npart of their land; and if it is wages or profit, the interest of the\nlabourers in the one case, and of their employers in the other, will\nprompt them to withdraw a part of their labour or stock, from this\nemployment. The quantity brought to market will soon be no more than\nsufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different parts of its\nprice will rise to their natural rate, and the whole price to its natural\nprice.\nIf, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any time\nfall short of the effectual demand, some of the component parts of its\nprice must rise above their natural rate. If it is rent, the interest of\nall other landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare more land for\nthe raising of this commodity; if it is wages or profit, the interest of\nall other labourers and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more\nlabour and stock in preparing and bringing it to market. The quantity\nbrought thither will soon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand.\nAll the different parts of its price will soon sink to their natural rate,\nand the whole price to its natural price.\nThe natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which\nthe prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different\naccidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and\nsometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may be the\nobstacles which hinder them from settling in this centre of repose and\ncontinuance, they are constantly tending towards it.\nThe whole quantity of industry annually employed in order to bring any\ncommodity to market, naturally suits itself in this manner to the\neffectual demand. It naturally aims at bringing always that precise\nquantity thither which may be sufficient to supply, and no more than\nsupply, that demand.\nBut, in some employments, the same quantity of industry will, in different\nyears, produce very different quantities of commodities; while, in others,\nit will produce always the same, or very nearly the same. The same number\nof labourers in husbandry will, in different years, produce very different\nquantities of corn, wine, oil, hops, etc. But the same number of spinners\nor weavers will every year produce the same, or very nearly the same,\nquantity of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce of the\none species of industry which can be suited, in any respect, to the\neffectual demand; and as its actual produce is frequently much greater,\nand frequently much less, than its average produce, the quantity of the\ncommodities brought to market will sometimes exceed a good deal, and\nsometimes fall short a good deal, of the effectual demand. Even though\nthat demand, therefore, should continue always the same, their market\nprice will be liable to great fluctuations, will sometimes fall a good\ndeal below, and sometimes rise a good deal above, their natural price. In\nthe other species of industry, the produce of equal quantities of labour\nbeing always the same, or very nearly the same, it can be more exactly\nsuited to the effectual demand. While that demand continues the same,\ntherefore, the market price of the commodities is likely to do so too, and\nto be either altogether, or as nearly as can be judged of, the same with\nthe natural price. That the price of linen and woollen cloth is liable\nneither to such frequent, nor to such great variations, as the price of\ncorn, every man\u2019s experience will inform him. The price of the one species\nof commodities varies only with the variations in the demand; that of the\nother varies not only with the variations in the demand, but with the much\ngreater, and more frequent, variations in the quantity of what is brought\nto market, in order to supply that demand.\nThe occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any\ncommodity fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve\nthemselves into wages and profit. That part which resolves itself into\nrent is less affected by them. A rent certain in money is not in the least\naffected by them, either in its rate or in its value. A rent which\nconsists either in a certain proportion, or in a certain quantity, of the\nrude produce, is no doubt affected in its yearly value by all the\noccasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of that rude\nproduce; but it is seldom affected by them in its yearly rate. In settling\nthe terms of the lease, the landlord and farmer endeavour, according to\ntheir best judgment, to adjust that rate, not to the temporary and\noccasional, but to the average and ordinary price of the produce.\nSuch fluctuations affect both the value and the rate, either of wages or\nof profit, according as the market happens to be either overstocked or\nunderstocked with commodities or with labour, with work done, or with work\nto be done. A public mourning raises the price of black cloth (with which\nthe market is almost always understocked upon such occasions), and\naugments the profits of the merchants who possess any considerable\nquantity of it. It has no effect upon the wages of the weavers. The market\nis understocked with commodities, not with labour, with work done, not\nwith work to be done. It raises the wages of journeymen tailors. The\nmarket is here understocked with labour. There is an effectual demand for\nmore labour, for more work to be done, than can be had. It sinks the price\nof coloured silks and cloths, and thereby reduces the profits of the\nmerchants who have any considerable quantity of them upon hand. It sinks,\ntoo, the wages of the workmen employed in preparing such commodities, for\nwhich all demand is stopped for six months, perhaps for a twelvemonth. The\nmarket is here overstocked both with commodities and with labour.\nBut though the market price of every particular commodity is in this\nmanner continually gravitating, if one may say so, towards the natural\nprice; yet sometimes particular accidents, sometimes natural causes, and\nsometimes particular regulations of policy, may, in many commodities, keep\nup the market price, for a long time together, a good deal above the\nnatural price.\nWhen, by an increase in the effectual demand, the market price of some\nparticular commodity happens to rise a good deal above the natural price,\nthose who employ their stocks in supplying that market, are generally\ncareful to conceal this change. If it was commonly known, their great\nprofit would tempt so many new rivals to employ their stocks in the same\nway, that, the effectual demand being fully supplied, the market price\nwould soon be reduced to the natural price, and, perhaps, for some time\neven below it. If the market is at a great distance from the residence of\nthose who supply it, they may sometimes be able to keep the secret for\nseveral years together, and may so long enjoy their extraordinary profits\nwithout any new rivals. Secrets of this kind, however, it must be\nacknowledged, can seldom be long kept; and the extraordinary profit can\nlast very little longer than they are kept.\nSecrets in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than secrets in\ntrade. A dyer who has found the means of producing a particular colour\nwith materials which cost only half the price of those commonly made use\nof, may, with good management, enjoy the advantage of his discovery as\nlong as he lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity. His\nextraordinary gains arise from the high price which is paid for his\nprivate labour. They properly consist in the high wages of that labour.\nBut as they are repeated upon every part of his stock, and as their whole\namount bears, upon that account, a regular proportion to it, they are\ncommonly considered as extraordinary profits of stock.\nSuch enhancements of the market price are evidently the effects of\nparticular accidents, of which, however, the operation may sometimes last\nfor many years together.\nSome natural productions require such a singularity of soil and situation,\nthat all the land in a great country, which is fit for producing them, may\nnot be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. The whole quantity\nbrought to market, therefore, may be disposed of to those who are willing\nto give more than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land which\nproduced them, together with the wages of the labour and the profits of\nthe stock which were employed in preparing and bringing them to market,\naccording to their natural rates. Such commodities may continue for whole\ncenturies together to be sold at this high price; and that part of it\nwhich resolves itself into the rent of land, is in this case the part\nwhich is generally paid above its natural rate. The rent of the land which\naffords such singular and esteemed productions, like the rent of some\nvineyards in France of a peculiarly happy soil and situation, bears no\nregular proportion to the rent of other equally fertile and equally well\ncultivated land in its neighbourhood. The wages of the labour, and the\nprofits of the stock employed in bringing such commodities to market, on\nthe contrary, are seldom out of their natural proportion to those of the\nother employments of labour and stock in their neighbourhood.\nSuch enhancements of the market price are evidently the effect of natural\ncauses, which may hinder the effectual demand from ever being fully\nsupplied, and which may continue, therefore, to operate for ever.\nA monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company, has\nthe same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by\nkeeping the market constantly understocked by never fully supplying the\neffectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and\nraise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly\nabove their natural rate.\nThe price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can be got.\nThe natural price, or the price of free competition, on the contrary, is\nthe lowest which can be taken, not upon every occasion indeed, but for any\nconsiderable time together. The one is upon every occasion the highest\nwhich can be squeezed out of the buyers, or which it is supposed they will\nconsent to give; the other is the lowest which the sellers can commonly\nafford to take, and at the same time continue their business.\nThe exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and\nall those laws which restrain in particular employments, the competition\nto a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same\ntendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies,\nand may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of\nemployments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the\nnatural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits\nof the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate.\nSuch enhancements of the market price may last as long as the regulations\nof policy which give occasion to them.\nThe market price of any particular commodity, though it may continue long\nabove, can seldom continue long below, its natural price. Whatever part of\nit was paid below the natural rate, the persons whose interest it affected\nwould immediately feel the loss, and would immediately withdraw either so\nmuch land or so much labour, or so much stock, from being employed about\nit, that the quantity brought to market would soon be no more than\nsufficient to supply the effectual demand. Its market price, therefore,\nwould soon rise to the natural price; this at least would be the case\nwhere there was perfect liberty.\nThe same statutes of apprenticeship and other corporation laws, indeed,\nwhich, when a manufacture is in prosperity, enable the workman to raise\nhis wages a good deal above their natural rate, sometimes oblige him, when\nit decays, to let them down a good deal below it. As in the one case they\nexclude many people from his employment, so in the other they exclude him\nfrom many employments. The effect of such regulations, however, is not\nnear so durable in sinking the workman\u2019s wages below, as in raising them\nabove their natural rate. Their operation in the one way may endure for\nmany centuries, but in the other it can last no longer than the lives of\nsome of the workmen who were bred to the business in the time of its\nprosperity. When they are gone, the number of those who are afterwards\neducated to the trade will naturally suit itself to the effectual demand.\nThe policy must be as violent as that of Indostan or ancient Egypt (where\nevery man was bound by a principle of religion to follow the occupation of\nhis father, and was supposed to commit the most horrid sacrilege if he\nchanged it for another), which can in any particular employment, and for\nseveral generations together, sink either the wages of labour or the\nprofits of stock below their natural rate.\nThis is all that I think necessary to be observed at present concerning\nthe deviations, whether occasional or permanent, of the market price of\ncommodities from the natural price.\nThe natural price itself varies with the natural rate of each of its\ncomponent parts, of wages, profit, and rent; and in every society this\nrate varies according to their circumstances, according to their riches or\npoverty, their advancing, stationary, or declining condition. I shall, in\nthe four following chapters, endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly\nas I can, the causes of those different variations.\nFirst, I shall endeavour to explain what are the circumstances which\nnaturally determine the rate of wages, and in what manner those\ncircumstances are affected by the riches or poverty, by the advancing,\nstationary, or declining state of the society.\nSecondly, I shall endeavour to shew what are the circumstances which\nnaturally determine the rate of profit; and in what manner, too, those\ncircumstances are affected by the like variations in the state of the\nsociety.\nThough pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different\nemployments of labour and stock; yet a certain proportion seems commonly\nto take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the different\nemployments of labour, and the pecuniary profits in all the different\nemployments of stock. This proportion, it will appear hereafter, depends\npartly upon the nature of the different employments, and partly upon the\ndifferent laws and policy of the society in which they are carried on. But\nthough in many respects dependent upon the laws and policy, this\nproportion seems to be little affected by the riches or poverty of that\nsociety, by its advancing, stationary, or declining condition, but to\nremain the same, or very nearly the same, in all those different states. I\nshall, in the third place, endeavour to explain all the different\ncircumstances which regulate this proportion.\nIn the fourth and last place, I shall endeavour to shew what are the\ncircumstances which regulate the rent of land, and which either raise or\nlower the real price of all the different substances which it produces.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nOF THE WAGES OF LABOUR.\nThe produce of labour constitutes the natural recompence or wages of\nlabour. In that original state of things which precedes both the\nappropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of\nlabour belongs to the labourer. He has neither landlord nor master to\nshare with him.\nHad this state continued, the wages of labour would have augmented with\nall those improvements in its productive powers, to which the division of\nlabour gives occasion. All things would gradually have become cheaper.\nThey would have been produced by a smaller quantity of labour; and as the\ncommodities produced by equal quantities of labour would naturally in this\nstate of things be exchanged for one another, they would have been\npurchased likewise with the produce of a smaller quantity.\nBut though all things would have become cheaper in reality, in appearance\nmany things might have become dearer, than before, or have been exchanged\nfor a greater quantity of other goods. Let us suppose, for example, that\nin the greater part of employments the productive powers of labour had\nbeen improved to tenfold, or that a day\u2019s labour could produce ten times\nthe quantity of work which it had done originally; but that in a\nparticular employment they had been improved only to double, or that a\nday\u2019s labour could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had\ndone before. In exchanging the produce of a day\u2019s labour in the greater\npart of employments for that of a day\u2019s labour in this particular one, ten\ntimes the original quantity of work in them would purchase only twice the\noriginal quantity in it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound\nweight, for example, would appear to be five times dearer than before. In\nreality, however, it would be twice as cheap. Though it required five\ntimes the quantity of other goods to purchase it, it would require only\nhalf the quantity of labour either to purchase or to produce it. The\nacquisition, therefore, would be twice as easy as before.\nBut this original state of things, in which the labourer enjoyed the whole\nproduce of his own labour, could not last beyond the first introduction of\nthe appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock. It was at an end,\ntherefore, long before the most considerable improvements were made in the\nproductive powers of labour; and it would be to no purpose to trace\nfurther what might have been its effects upon the recompence or wages of\nlabour.\nAs soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a share of\nalmost all the produce which the labourer can either raise or collect from\nit. His rent makes the first deduction from the produce of the labour\nwhich is employed upon land.\nIt seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has wherewithal to\nmaintain himself till he reaps the harvest. His maintenance is generally\nadvanced to him from the stock of a master, the farmer who employs him,\nand who would have no interest to employ him, unless he was to share in\nthe produce of his labour, or unless his stock was to be replaced to him\nwith a profit. This profit makes a second deduction from the produce of\nthe labour which is employed upon land.\nThe produce of almost all other labour is liable to the like deduction of\nprofit. In all arts and manufactures, the greater part of the workmen\nstand in need of a master, to advance them the materials of their work,\nand their wages and maintenance, till it be completed. He shares in the\nproduce of their labour, or in the value which it adds to the materials\nupon which it is bestowed; and in this share consists his profit.\nIt sometimes happens, indeed, that a single independent workman has stock\nsufficient both to purchase the materials of his work, and to maintain\nhimself till it be completed. He is both master and workman, and enjoys\nthe whole produce of his own labour, or the whole value which it adds to\nthe materials upon which it is bestowed. It includes what are usually two\ndistinct revenues, belonging to two distinct persons, the profits of\nstock, and the wages of labour.\nSuch cases, however, are not very frequent; and in every part of Europe\ntwenty workmen serve under a master for one that is independent, and the\nwages of labour are everywhere understood to be, what they usually are,\nwhen the labourer is one person, and the owner of the stock which employs\nhim another.\nWhat are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the contract\nusually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means\nthe same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as\nlittle, as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise,\nthe latter in order to lower, the wages of labour.\nIt is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must,\nupon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force\nthe other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in\nnumber, can combine much more easily: and the law, besides, authorises, or\nat least does not prohibit, their combinations, while it prohibits those\nof the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower\nthe price of work, but many against combining to raise it. In all such\ndisputes, the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a\nmaster manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not employ a single\nworkman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks, which they\nhave already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could\nsubsist a month, and scarce any a year, without employment. In the long\nrun, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to\nhim; but the necessity is not so immediate.\nWe rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though\nfrequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account,\nthat masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the\nsubject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but\nconstant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above\ntheir actual rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most\nunpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours\nand equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the\nusual, and, one may say, the natural state of things, which nobody ever\nhears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular combinations to\nsink the wages of labour even below this rate. These are always conducted\nwith the utmost silence and secrecy till the moment of execution; and when\nthe workmen yield, as they sometimes do without resistance, though\nseverely felt by them, they are never heard of by other people. Such\ncombinations, however, are frequently resisted by a contrary defensive\ncombination of the workmen, who sometimes, too, without any provocation of\nthis kind, combine, of their own accord, to raise the price of their\nlabour. Their usual pretences are, sometimes the high price of provisions,\nsometimes the great profit which their masters make by their work. But\nwhether their combinations be offensive or defensive, they are always\nabundantly heard of. In order to bring the point to a speedy decision,\nthey have always recourse to the loudest clamour, and sometimes to the\nmost shocking violence and outrage. They are desperate, and act with the\nfolly and extravagance of desperate men, who must either starve, or\nfrighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their demands.\nThe masters, upon these occasions, are just as clamorous upon the other\nside, and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil\nmagistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been\nenacted with so much severity against the combination of servants,\nlabourers, and journeymen. The workmen, accordingly, very seldom derive\nany advantage from the violence of those tumultuous combinations, which,\npartly from the interposition of the civil magistrate, partly from the\nsuperior steadiness of the masters, partly from the necessity which the\ngreater part of the workmen are under of submitting for the sake of\npresent subsistence, generally end in nothing but the punishment or ruin\nof the ringleaders.\nBut though, in disputes with their workmen, masters must generally have\nthe advantage, there is, however, a certain rate, below which it seems\nimpossible to reduce, for any considerable time, the ordinary wages even\nof the lowest species of labour.\nA man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be\nsufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat\nmore, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and\nthe race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation. Mr\nCantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the lowest species of\ncommon labourers must everywhere earn at least double their own\nmaintenance, in order that, one with another, they may be enabled to bring\nup two children; the labour of the wife, on account of her necessary\nattendance on the children, being supposed no more than sufficient to\nprovide for herself: But one half the children born, it is computed, die\nbefore the age of manhood. The poorest labourers, therefore, according to\nthis account, must, one with another, attempt to rear at least four\nchildren, in order that two may have an equal chance of living to that\nage. But the necessary maintenance of four children, it is supposed, may\nbe nearly equal to that of one man. The labour of an able-bodied slave,\nthe same author adds, is computed to be worth double his maintenance; and\nthat of the meanest labourer, he thinks, cannot be worth less than that of\nan able-bodied slave. Thus far at least seems certain, that, in order to\nbring up a family, the labour of the husband and wife together must, even\nin the lowest species of common labour, be able to earn something more\nthan what is precisely necessary for their own maintenance; but in what\nproportion, whether in that above-mentioned, or any other, I shall not\ntake upon me to determine.\nThere are certain circumstances, however, which sometimes give the\nlabourers an advantage, and enable them to raise their wages considerably\nabove this rate, evidently the lowest which is consistent with common\nhumanity.\nWhen in any country the demand for those who live by wages, labourers,\njourneymen, servants of every kind, is continually increasing; when every\nyear furnishes employment for a greater number than had been employed the\nyear before, the workmen have no occasion to combine in order to raise\ntheir wages. The scarcity of hands occasions a competition among masters,\nwho bid against one another in order to get workmen, and thus voluntarily\nbreak through the natural combination of masters not to raise wages. The\ndemand for those who live by wages, it is evident, cannot increase but in\nproportion to the increase of the funds which are destined to the payment\nof wages. These funds are of two kinds, first, the revenue which is over\nand above what is necessary for the maintenance; and, secondly, the stock\nwhich is over and above what is necessary for the employment of their\nmasters.\nWhen the landlord, annuitant, or monied man, has a greater revenue than\nwhat he judges sufficient to maintain his own family, he employs either\nthe whole or a part of the surplus in maintaining one or more menial\nservants. Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase the number\nof those servants.\nWhen an independent workman, such as a weaver or shoemaker, has got more\nstock than what is sufficient to purchase the materials of his own work,\nand to maintain himself till he can dispose of it, he naturally employs\none or more journeymen with the surplus, in order to make a profit by\ntheir work. Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase the\nnumber of his journeymen.\nThe demand for those who live by wages, therefore, necessarily increases\nwith the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and cannot\npossibly increase without it. The increase of revenue and stock is the\nincrease of national wealth. The demand for those who live by wages,\ntherefore, naturally increases with the increase of national wealth, and\ncannot possibly increase without it.\nIt is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual\nincrease, which occasions a rise in the wages of labour. It is not,\naccordingly, in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in\nthose which are growing rich the fastest, that the wages of labour are\nhighest. England is certainly, in the present times, a much richer country\nthan any part of North America. The wages of labour, however, are much\nhigher in North America than in any part of England. In the province of\nNew York, common labourers earned in 1773, before the commencement of the\nlate disturbances, three shillings and sixpence currency, equal to two\nshillings sterling, a-day; ship-carpenters, ten shillings and sixpence\ncurrency, with a pint of rum, worth sixpence sterling, equal in all to six\nshillings and sixpence sterling; house-carpenters and bricklayers, eight\nshillings currency, equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling;\njourneymen tailors, five shillings currency, equal to about two shillings\nand tenpence sterling. These prices are all above the London price; and\nwages are said to be as high in the other colonies as in New York. The\nprice of provisions is everywhere in North America much lower than in\nEngland. A dearth has never been known there. In the worst seasons they\nhave always had a sufficiency for themselves, though less for exportation.\nIf the money price of labour, therefore, be higher than it is anywhere in\nthe mother-country, its real price, the real command of the necessaries\nand conveniencies of life which it conveys to the labourer, must be higher\nin a still greater proportion.\nBut though North America is not yet so rich as England, it is much more\nthriving, and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further\nacquisition of riches. The most decisive mark of the prosperity of any\ncountry is the increase of the number of its inhabitants. In Great\nBritain, and most other European countries, they are not supposed to\ndouble in less than five hundred years. In the British colonies in North\nAmerica, it has been found that they double in twenty or five-and-twenty\nyears. Nor in the present times is this increase principally owing to the\ncontinual importation of new inhabitants, but to the great multiplication\nof the species. Those who live to old age, it is said, frequently see\nthere from fifty to a hundred, and sometimes many more, descendants from\ntheir own body. Labour is there so well rewarded, that a numerous family\nof children, instead of being a burden, is a source of opulence and\nprosperity to the parents. The labour of each child, before it can leave\ntheir house, is computed to be worth a hundred pounds clear gain to them.\nA young widow with four or five young children, who, among the middling or\ninferior ranks of people in Europe, would have so little chance for a\nsecond husband, is there frequently courted as a sort of fortune. The\nvalue of children is the greatest of all encouragements to marriage. We\ncannot, therefore, wonder that the people in North America should\ngenerally marry very young. Notwithstanding the great increase occasioned\nby such early marriages, there is a continual complaint of the scarcity of\nhands in North America. The demand for labourers, the funds destined for\nmaintaining them increase, it seems, still faster than they can find\nlabourers to employ.\nThough the wealth of a country should be very great, yet if it has been\nlong stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labour very high\nin it. The funds destined for the payment of wages, the revenue and stock\nof its inhabitants, may be of the greatest extent; but if they have\ncontinued for several centuries of the same, or very nearly of the same\nextent, the number of labourers employed every year could easily supply,\nand even more than supply, the number wanted the following year. There\ncould seldom be any scarcity of hands, nor could the masters be obliged to\nbid against one another in order to get them. The hands, on the contrary,\nwould, in this case, naturally multiply beyond their employment. There\nwould be a constant scarcity of employment, and the labourers would be\nobliged to bid against one another in order to get it. If in such a\ncountry the wages of labour had ever been more than sufficient to\nmaintain the labourer, and to enable him to bring up a family, the\ncompetition of the labourers and the interest of the masters would soon\nreduce them to the lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity.\nChina has been long one of the richest, that is, one of the most fertile,\nbest cultivated, most industrious, and most populous, countries in the\nworld. It seems, however, to have been long stationary. Marco Polo, who\nvisited it more than five hundred years ago, describes its cultivation,\nindustry, and populousness, almost in the same terms in which they are\ndescribed by travellers in the present times. It had, perhaps, even long\nbefore his time, acquired that full complement of riches which the nature\nof its laws and institutions permits it to acquire. The accounts of all\ntravellers, inconsistent in many other respects, agree in the low wages of\nlabour, and in the difficulty which a labourer finds in bringing up a\nfamily in China. If by digging the ground a whole day he can get what will\npurchase a small quantity of rice in the evening, he is contented. The\ncondition of artificers is, if possible, still worse. Instead of waiting\nindolently in their work-houses for the calls of their customers, as in\nEurope, they are continually running about the streets with the tools of\ntheir respective trades, offering their services, and, as it were, begging\nemployment. The poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far\nsurpasses that of the most beggarly nations in Europe. In the\nneighbourhood of Canton, many hundred, it is commonly said, many thousand\nfamilies have no habitation on the land, but live constantly in little\nfishing-boats upon the rivers and canals. The subsistence which they find\nthere is so scanty, that they are eager to fish up the nastiest garbage\nthrown overboard from any European ship. Any carrion, the carcase of a\ndead dog or cat, for example, though half putrid and stinking, is as\nwelcome to them as the most wholesome food to the people of other\ncountries. Marriage is encouraged in China, not by the profitableness of\nchildren, but by the liberty of destroying them. In all great towns,\nseveral are every night exposed in the street, or drowned like puppies in\nthe water. The performance of this horrid office is even said to be the\navowed business by which some people earn their subsistence.\nChina, however, though it may, perhaps, stand still, does not seem to go\nbackwards. Its towns are nowhere deserted by their inhabitants. The lands\nwhich had once been cultivated, are nowhere neglected. The same, or very\nnearly the same, annual labour, must, therefore, continue to be performed,\nand the funds destined for maintaining it must not, consequently, be\nsensibly diminished. The lowest class of labourers, therefore,\nnotwithstanding their scanty subsistence, must some way or another make\nshift to continue their race so far as to keep up their usual numbers.\nBut it would be otherwise in a country where the funds destined for the\nmaintenance of labour were sensibly decaying. Every year the demand for\nservants and labourers would, in all the different classes of employments,\nbe less than it had been the year before. Many who had been bred in the\nsuperior classes, not being able to find employment in their own business,\nwould be glad to seek it in the lowest. The lowest class being not only\noverstocked with its own workmen, but with the overflowings of all the\nother classes, the competition for employment would be so great in it, as\nto reduce the wages of labour to the most miserable and scanty subsistence\nof the labourer. Many would not be able to find employment even upon these\nhard terms, but would either starve, or be driven to seek a subsistence,\neither by begging, or by the perpetration perhaps, of the greatest\nenormities. Want, famine, and mortality, would immediately prevail in that\nclass, and from thence extend themselves to all the superior classes, till\nthe number of inhabitants in the country was reduced to what could easily\nbe maintained by the revenue and stock which remained in it, and which had\nescaped either the tyranny or calamity which had destroyed the rest. This,\nperhaps, is nearly the present state of Bengal, and of some other of the\nEnglish settlements in the East Indies. In a fertile country, which had\nbefore been much depopulated, where subsistence, consequently, should not\nbe very difficult, and where, notwithstanding, three or four hundred\nthousand people die of hunger in one year, we may be assured that the funds\ndestined for the maintenance of the labouring poor are fast decaying. The\ndifference between the genius of the British constitution, which protects\nand governs North America, and that of the mercantile company which\noppresses and domineers in the East Indies, cannot, perhaps, be better\nillustrated than by the different state of those countries.\nThe liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the necessary effect, so\nit is the natural symptom of increasing national wealth. The scanty\nmaintenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural\nsymptom that things are at a stand, and their starving condition, that\nthey are going fast backwards.\nIn Great Britain, the wages of labour seem, in the present times, to be\nevidently more than what is precisely necessary to enable the labourer to\nbring up a family. In order to satisfy ourselves upon this point, it will\nnot be necessary to enter into any tedious or doubtful calculation of what\nmay be the lowest sum upon which it is possible to do this. There are many\nplain symptoms, that the wages of labour are nowhere in this country\nregulated by this lowest rate, which is consistent with common humanity.\nFirst, in almost every part of Great Britain there is a distinction, even\nin the lowest species of labour, between summer and winter wages. Summer\nwages are always highest. But, on account of the extraordinary expense of\nfuel, the maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter. Wages,\ntherefore, being highest when this expense is lowest, it seems evident\nthat they are not regulated by what is necessary for this expense, but by\nthe quantity and supposed value of the work. A labourer, it may be said,\nindeed, ought to save part of his summer wages, in order to defray his\nwinter expense; and that, through the whole year, they do not exceed what\nis necessary to maintain his family through the whole year. A slave,\nhowever, or one absolutely dependent on us for immediate subsistence,\nwould not be treated in this manner. His daily subsistence would be\nproportioned to his daily necessities.\nSecondly, the wages of labour do not, in Great Britain, fluctuate with the\nprice of provisions. These vary everywhere from year to year, frequently\nfrom month to month. But in many places, the money price of labour remains\nuniformly the same, sometimes for half a century together. If, in these\nplaces, therefore, the labouring poor can maintain their families in dear\nyears, they must be at their ease in times of moderate plenty, and in\naffluence in those of extraordinary cheapness. The high price of\nprovisions during these ten years past, has not, in many parts of the\nkingdom, been accompanied with any sensible rise in the money price of\nlabour. It has, indeed, in some; owing, probably, more to the increase of\nthe demand for labour, than to that of the price of provisions.\nThirdly, as the price of provisions varies more from year to year than the\nwages of labour, so, on the other hand, the wages of labour vary more from\nplace to place than the price of provisions. The prices of bread and\nbutchers\u2019 meat are generally the same, or very nearly the same, through\nthe greater part of the united kingdom. These, and most other things which\nare sold by retail, the way in which the labouring poor buy all things,\nare generally fully as cheap, or cheaper, in great towns than in the\nremoter parts of the country, for reasons which I shall have occasion to\nexplain hereafter. But the wages of labour in a great town and its\nneighbourhood are frequently a fourth or a fifth part, twenty or five-and\u2014twenty\nper cent. higher than at a few miles distance. Eighteen pence a day may be\nreckoned the common price of labour in London and its neighbourhood. At a\nfew miles distance, it falls to fourteen and fifteen pence. Tenpence may\nbe reckoned its price in Edinburgh and its neighbourhood. At a few miles\ndistance, it falls to eightpence, the usual price of common labour through\nthe greater part of the low country of Scotland, where it varies a good\ndeal less than in England. Such a difference of prices, which, it seems,\nis not always sufficient to transport a man from one parish to another,\nwould necessarily occasion so great a transportation of the most bulky\ncommodities, not only from one parish to another, but from one end of the\nkingdom, almost from one end of the world to the other, as would soon\nreduce them more nearly to a level. After all that has been said of the\nlevity and inconstancy of human nature, it appears evidently from\nexperience, that man is, of all sorts of luggage, the most difficult to be\ntransported. If the labouring poor, therefore, can maintain their families\nin those parts of the kingdom where the price of labour is lowest, they\nmust be in affluence where it is highest.\nFourthly, the variations in the price of labour not only do not\ncorrespond, either in place or time, with those in the price of\nprovisions, but they are frequently quite opposite.\nGrain, the food of the common people, is dearer in Scotland than in\nEngland, whence Scotland receives almost every year very large supplies.\nBut English corn must be sold dearer in Scotland, the country to which it\nis brought, than in England, the country from which it comes; and in\nproportion to its quality it cannot be sold dearer in Scotland than the\nScotch corn that comes to the same market in competition with it. The\nquality of grain depends chiefly upon the quantity of flour or meal which\nit yields at the mill; and, in this respect, English grain is so much\nsuperior to the Scotch, that though often dearer in appearance, or in\nproportion to the measure of its bulk, it is generally cheaper in reality,\nor in proportion to its quality, or even to the measure of its weight. The\nprice of labour, on the contrary, is dearer in England than in Scotland.\nIf the labouring poor, therefore, can maintain their families in the one\npart of the united kingdom, they must be in affluence in the other.\nOatmeal, indeed, supplies the common people in Scotland with the greatest\nand the best part of their food, which is, in general, much inferior to\nthat of their neighbours of the same rank in England. This difference,\nhowever, in the mode of their subsistence, is not the cause, but the\neffect, of the difference in their wages; though, by a strange\nmisapprehension, I have frequently heard it represented as the cause. It\nis not because one man keeps a coach, while his neighbour walks a-foot,\nthat the one is rich, and the other poor; but because the one is rich, he\nkeeps a coach, and because the other is poor, he walks a-foot.\nDuring the course of the last century, taking one year with another, grain\nwas dearer in both parts of the united kingdom than during that of the\npresent. This is a matter of fact which cannot now admit of any reasonable\ndoubt; and the proof of it is, if possible, still more decisive with\nregard to Scotland than with regard to England. It is in Scotland\nsupported by the evidence of the public fiars, annual valuations made upon\noath, according to the actual state of the markets, of all the different\nsorts of grain in every different county of Scotland. If such direct proof\ncould require any collateral evidence to confirm it, I would observe, that\nthis has likewise been the case in France, and probably in most other\nparts of Europe. With regard to France, there is the clearest proof. But\nthough it is certain, that in both parts of the united kingdom grain was\nsomewhat dearer in the last century than in the present, it is equally\ncertain that labour was much cheaper. If the labouring poor, therefore,\ncould bring up their families then, they must be much more at their ease\nnow. In the last century, the most usual day-wages of common labour\nthrough the greater part of Scotland were sixpence in summer, and\nfivepence in winter. Three shillings a-week, the same price, very nearly\nstill continues to be paid in some parts of the Highlands and Western\nislands. Through the greater part of the Low country, the most usual wages\nof common labour are now eight pence a-day; tenpence, sometimes a\nshilling, about Edinburgh, in the counties which border upon England,\nprobably on account of that neighbourhood, and in a few other places where\nthere has lately been a considerable rise in the demand for labour, about\nGlasgow, Carron, Ayrshire, etc. In England, the improvements of\nagriculture, manufactures, and commerce, began much earlier than in\nScotland. The demand for labour, and consequently its price, must\nnecessarily have increased with those improvements. In the last century,\naccordingly, as well as in the present, the wages of labour were higher in\nEngland than in Scotland. They have risen, too, considerably since that\ntime, though, on account of the greater variety of wages paid there in\ndifferent places, it is more difficult to ascertain how much. In 1614, the\npay of a foot soldier was the same as in the present times, eightpence\na-day. When it was first established, it would naturally be regulated by\nthe usual wages of common labourers, the rank of people from which foot\nsoldiers are commonly drawn. Lord-chief-justice Hales, who wrote in the\ntime of Charles II. computes the necessary expense of a labourer\u2019s family,\nconsisting of six persons, the father and mother, two children able to do\nsomething, and two not able, at ten shillings a-week, or twenty-six pounds\na-year. If they cannot earn this by their labour, they must make it up, he\nsupposes, either by begging or stealing. He appears to have enquired very\ncarefully into this subject {See his scheme for the maintenance of the\npoor, in Burn\u2019s History of the Poor Laws.}. In 1688, Mr Gregory King,\nwhose skill in political arithmetic is so much extolled by Dr Davenant,\ncomputed the ordinary income of labourers and out-servants to be fifteen\npounds a-year to a family, which he supposed to consist, one with another,\nof three and a half persons. His calculation, therefore, though different\nin appearance, corresponds very nearly at bottom with that of Judge Hales.\nBoth suppose the weekly expense of such families to be about twenty-pence\na-head. Both the pecuniary income and expense of such families have\nincreased considerably since that time through the greater part of the\nkingdom, in some places more, and in some less, though perhaps scarce\nanywhere so much as some exaggerated accounts of the present wages of\nlabour have lately represented them to the public. The price of labour, it\nmust be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere,\ndifferent prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort\nof labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workman,\nbut according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are\nnot regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is, what are\nthe most usual; and experience seems to shew that law can never regulate\nthem properly, though it has often pretended to do so.\nThe real recompence of labour, the real quantity of the necessaries and\nconveniencies of life which it can procure to the labourer, has, during\nthe course of the present century, increased perhaps in a still greater\nproportion than its money price. Not only grain has become somewhat\ncheaper, but many other things, from which the industrious poor derive an\nagreeable and wholesome variety of food, have become a great deal cheaper.\nPotatoes, for example, do not at present, through the greater part of the\nkingdom, cost half the price which they used to do thirty or forty years\nago. The same thing may be said of turnips, carrots, cabbages; things\nwhich were formerly never raised but by the spade, but which are now\ncommonly raised by the plough. All sort of garden stuff, too, has become\ncheaper. The greater part of the apples, and even of the onions, consumed\nin Great Britain, were, in the last century, imported from Flanders. The\ngreat improvements in the coarser manufactories of both linen and woollen\ncloth furnish the labourers with cheaper and better clothing; and those in\nthe manufactories of the coarser metals, with cheaper and better\ninstruments of trade, as well as with many agreeable and convenient pieces\nof household furniture. Soap, salt, candles, leather, and fermented\nliquors, have, indeed, become a good deal dearer, chiefly from the taxes\nwhich have been laid upon them. The quantity of these, however, which the\nlabouring poor are under any necessity of consuming, is so very small, that\nthe increase in their price does not compensate the diminution in that of\nso many other things. The common complaint, that luxury extends itself\neven to the lowest ranks of the people, and that the labouring poor will\nnot now be contented with the same food, clothing, and lodging, which\nsatisfied them in former times, may convince us that it is not the money\nprice of labour only, but its real recompence, which has augmented.\nIs this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the people\nto be regarded as an advantage, or as an inconveniency, to the society?\nThe answer seems at first abundantly plain. Servants, labourers, and\nworkmen of different kinds, make up the far greater part of every great\npolitical society. But what improves the circumstances of the greater\npart, can never be regarded as any inconveniency to the whole. No society\ncan surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the\nmembers are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who\nfeed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a\nshare of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably\nwell fed, clothed, and lodged.\nPoverty, though it no doubt discourages, does not always prevent,\nmarriage. It seems even to be favourable to generation. A half-starved\nHighland woman frequently bears more than twenty children, while a\npampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any, and is generally\nexhausted by two or three. Barrenness, so frequent among women of fashion,\nis very rare among those of inferior station. Luxury, in the fair sex,\nwhile it inflames, perhaps, the passion for enjoyment, seems always to\nweaken, and frequently to destroy altogether, the powers of generation.\nBut poverty, though it does not prevent the generation, is extremely\nunfavourable to the rearing of children. The tender plant is produced; but\nin so cold a soil, and so severe a climate, soon withers and dies. It is\nnot uncommon, I have been frequently told, in the Highlands of Scotland,\nfor a mother who has born twenty children not to have two alive. Several\nofficers of great experience have assured me, that, so far from recruiting\ntheir regiment, they have never been able to supply it with drums and\nfifes, from all the soldiers\u2019 children that were born in it. A greater\nnumber of fine children, however, is seldom seen anywhere than about a\nbarrack of soldiers. Very few of them, it seems, arrive at the age of\nthirteen or fourteen. In some places, one half the children die before\nthey are four years of age, in many places before they are seven, and in\nalmost all places before they are nine or ten. This great mortality,\nhowever will everywhere be found chiefly among the children of the common\npeople, who cannot afford to tend them with the same care as those of\nbetter station. Though their marriages are generally more fruitful than\nthose of people of fashion, a smaller proportion of their children arrive\nat maturity. In foundling hospitals, and among the children brought up by\nparish charities, the mortality is still greater than among those of the\ncommon people.\nEvery species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the means\nof their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply beyond it. But in\ncivilized society, it is only among the inferior ranks of people that the\nscantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of\nthe human species; and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a\ngreat part of the children which their fruitful marriages produce.\nThe liberal reward of labour, by enabling them to provide better for their\nchildren, and consequently to bring up a greater number, naturally tends\nto widen and extend those limits. It deserves to be remarked, too, that it\nnecessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which the\ndemand for labour requires. If this demand is continually increasing, the\nreward of labour must necessarily encourage in such a manner the marriage\nand multiplication of labourers, as may enable them to supply that\ncontinually increasing demand by a continually increasing population. If\nthe reward should at any time be less than what was requisite for this\npurpose, the deficiency of hands would soon raise it; and if it should at\nany time be more, their excessive multiplication would soon lower it to\nthis necessary rate. The market would be so much understocked with labour\nin the one case, and so much overstocked in the other, as would soon force\nback its price to that proper rate which the circumstances of the society\nrequired. It is in this manner that the demand for men, like that for any\nother commodity, necessarily regulates the production of men, quickens it\nwhen it goes on too slowly, and stops it when it advances too fast. It is\nthis demand which regulates and determines the state of propagation in all\nthe different countries of the world; in North America, in Europe, and in\nChina; which renders it rapidly progressive in the first, slow and gradual\nin the second, and altogether stationary in the last.\nThe wear and tear of a slave, it has been said, is at the expense of his\nmaster; but that of a free servant is at his own expense. The wear and\ntear of the latter, however, is, in reality, as much at the expense of his\nmaster as that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and servants of\nevery kind must be such as may enable them, one with another to continue\nthe race of journeymen and servants, according as the increasing,\ndiminishing, or stationary demand of the society, may happen to require.\nBut though the wear and tear of a free servant be equally at the expense\nof his master, it generally costs him much less than that of a slave. The\nfund destined for replacing or repairing, if I may say so, the wear and\ntear of the slave, is commonly managed by a negligent master or careless\noverseer. That destined for performing the same office with regard to the\nfreeman is managed by the freeman himself. The disorders which generally\nprevail in the economy of the rich, naturally introduce themselves into\nthe management of the former; the strict frugality and parsimonious\nattention of the poor as naturally establish themselves in that of the\nlatter. Under such different management, the same purpose must require\nvery different degrees of expense to execute it. It appears, accordingly,\nfrom the experience of all ages and nations, I believe, that the work done\nby freemen comes cheaper in the end than that performed by slaves. It is\nfound to do so even at Boston, New-York, and Philadelphia, where the wages\nof common labour are so very high.\nThe liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing\nwealth, so it is the cause of increasing population. To complain of it, is\nto lament over the necessary cause and effect of the greatest public\nprosperity.\nIt deserves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progressive state,\nwhile the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than\nwhen it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of\nthe labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the\nhappiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and\nmiserable in the declining state. The progressive state is, in reality,\nthe cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of the\nsociety; the stationary is dull; the declining melancholy.\nThe liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, so it\nincreases the industry of the common people. The wages of labour are the\nencouragement of industry, which, like every other human quality, improves\nin proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful subsistence\nincreases the bodily strength of the labourer, and the comfortable hope of\nbettering his condition, and of ending his days, perhaps, in ease and\nplenty, animates him to exert that strength to the utmost. Where wages are\nhigh, accordingly, we shall always find the workmen more active, diligent,\nand expeditious, than where they are low; in England, for example, than in\nScotland; in the neighbourhood of great towns, than in remote country\nplaces. Some workmen, indeed, when they can earn in four days what will\nmaintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This,\nhowever, is by no means the case with the greater part. Workmen, on the\ncontrary, when they are liberally paid by the piece, are very apt to\noverwork themselves, and to ruin their health and constitution in a few\nyears. A carpenter in London, and in some other places, is not supposed to\nlast in his utmost vigour above eight years. Something of the same kind\nhappens in many other trades, in which the workmen are paid by the piece;\nas they generally are in manufactures, and even in country labour,\nwherever wages are higher than ordinary. Almost every class of artificers\nis subject to some peculiar infirmity occasioned by excessive application\nto their peculiar species of work. Ramuzzini, an eminent Italian\nphysician, has written a particular book concerning such diseases. We do\nnot reckon our soldiers the most industrious set of people among us; yet\nwhen soldiers have been employed in some particular sorts of work, and\nliberally paid by the piece, their officers have frequently been obliged\nto stipulate with the undertaker, that they should not be allowed to earn\nabove a certain sum every day, according to the rate at which they were\npaid. Till this stipulation was made, mutual emulation, and the desire of\ngreater gain, frequently prompted them to overwork themselves, and to hurt\ntheir health by excessive labour. Excessive application, during four days\nof the week, is frequently the real cause of the idleness of the other\nthree, so much and so loudly complained of. Great labour, either of mind\nor body, continued for several days together is, in most men, naturally\nfollowed by a great desire of relaxation, which, if not restrained by\nforce, or by some strong necessity, is almost irresistible. It is the call\nof nature, which requires to be relieved by some indulgence, sometimes of\nease only, but sometimes too of dissipation and diversion. If it is not\ncomplied with, the consequences are often dangerous and sometimes fatal,\nand such as almost always, sooner or later, bring on the peculiar\ninfirmity of the trade. If masters would always listen to the dictates of\nreason and humanity, they have frequently occasion rather to moderate,\nthan to animate the application of many of their workmen. It will be\nfound, I believe, in every sort of trade, that the man who works so\nmoderately, as to be able to work constantly, not only preserves his\nhealth the longest, but, in the course of the year, executes the greatest\nquantity of work.\nIn cheap years it is pretended, workmen are generally more idle, and in\ndear times more industrious than ordinary. A plentiful subsistence,\ntherefore, it has been concluded, relaxes, and a scanty one quickens their\nindustry. That a little more plenty than ordinary may render some workmen\nidle, cannot be well doubted; but that it should have this effect upon the\ngreater part, or that men in general should work better when they are ill\nfed, than when they are well fed, when they are disheartened than when\nthey are in good spirits, when they are frequently sick than when they are\ngenerally in good health, seems not very probable. Years of dearth, it is\nto be observed, are generally among the common people years of sickness\nand mortality, which cannot fail to diminish the produce of their\nindustry.\nIn years of plenty, servants frequently leave their masters, and trust\ntheir subsistence to what they can make by their own industry. But the\nsame cheapness of provisions, by increasing the fund which is destined for\nthe maintenance of servants, encourages masters, farmers especially, to\nemploy a greater number. Farmers, upon such occasions, expect more profit\nfrom their corn by maintaining a few more labouring servants, than by\nselling it at a low price in the market. The demand for servants\nincreases, while the number of those who offer to supply that demand\ndiminishes. The price of labour, therefore, frequently rises in cheap\nyears.\nIn years of scarcity, the difficulty and uncertainty of subsistence make\nall such people eager to return to service. But the high price of\nprovisions, by diminishing the funds destined for the maintenance of\nservants, disposes masters rather to diminish than to increase the number\nof those they have. In dear years, too, poor independent workmen\nfrequently consume the little stock with which they had used to supply\nthemselves with the materials of their work, and are obliged to become\njourneymen for subsistence. More people want employment than easily get\nit; many are willing to take it upon lower terms than ordinary; and the\nwages of both servants and journeymen frequently sink in dear years.\nMasters of all sorts, therefore, frequently make better bargains with\ntheir servants in dear than in cheap years, and find them more humble and\ndependent in the former than in the latter. They naturally, therefore,\ncommend the former as more favourable to industry. Landlords and farmers,\nbesides, two of the largest classes of masters, have another reason for\nbeing pleased with dear years. The rents of the one, and the profits of\nthe other, depend very much upon the price of provisions. Nothing can be\nmore absurd, however, than to imagine that men in general should work less\nwhen they work for themselves, than when they work for other people. A\npoor independent workman will generally be more industrious than even a\njourneyman who works by the piece. The one enjoys the whole produce of his\nown industry, the other shares it with his master. The one, in his\nseparate independent state, is less liable to the temptations of bad\ncompany, which, in large manufactories, so frequently ruin the morals of\nthe other. The superiority of the independent workman over those servants\nwho are hired by the month or by the year, and whose wages and maintenance\nare the same, whether they do much or do little, is likely to be still\ngreater. Cheap years tend to increase the proportion of independent\nworkmen to journeymen and servants of all kinds, and dear years to\ndiminish it.\nA French author of great knowledge and ingenuity, Mr Messance, receiver of\nthe tallies in the election of St Etienne, endeavours to shew that the\npoor do more work in cheap than in dear years, by comparing the quantity\nand value of the goods made upon those different occasions in three\ndifferent manufactures; one of coarse woollens, carried on at Elbeuf; one\nof linen, and another of silk, both which extend through the whole\ngenerality of Rouen. It appears from his account, which is copied from the\nregisters of the public offices, that the quantity and value of the goods\nmade in all those three manufactories has generally been greater in cheap\nthan in dear years, and that it has always been greatest in the cheapest,\nand least in the dearest years. All the three seem to be stationary\nmanufactures, or which, though their produce may vary somewhat from year\nto year, are, upon the whole, neither going backwards nor forwards.\nThe manufacture of linen in Scotland, and that of coarse woollens in the\nWest Riding of Yorkshire, are growing manufactures, of which the produce\nis generally, though with some variations, increasing both in quantity and\nvalue. Upon examining, however, the accounts which have been published of\ntheir annual produce, I have not been able to observe that its variations\nhave had any sensible connection with the dearness or cheapness of the\nseasons. In 1740, a year of great scarcity, both manufactures, indeed,\nappear to have declined very considerably. But in 1756, another year of\ngreat scarcity, the Scotch manufactures made more than ordinary advances.\nThe Yorkshire manufacture, indeed, declined, and its produce did not rise\nto what it had been in 1755, till 1766, after the repeal of the American\nstamp act. In that and the following year, it greatly exceeded what it had\never been before, and it has continued to advance ever since.\nThe produce of all great manufactures for distant sale must necessarily\ndepend, not so much upon the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in the\ncountries where they are carried on, as upon the circumstances which\naffect the demand in the countries where they are consumed; upon peace or\nwar, upon the prosperity or declension of other rival manufactures and\nupon the good or bad humour of their principal customers. A great part of\nthe extraordinary work, besides, which is probably done in cheap years,\nnever enters the public registers of manufactures. The men-servants, who\nleave their masters, become independent labourers. The women return to\ntheir parents, and commonly spin, in order to make clothes for themselves\nand their families. Even the independent workmen do not always work for\npublic sale, but are employed by some of their neighbours in manufactures\nfor family use. The produce of their labour, therefore, frequently makes\nno figure in those public registers, of which the records are sometimes\npublished with so much parade, and from which our merchants and\nmanufacturers would often vainly pretend to announce the prosperity or\ndeclension of the greatest empires.\nThough the variations in the price of labour not only do not always\ncorrespond with those in the price of provisions, but are frequently quite\nopposite, we must not, upon this account, imagine that the price of\nprovisions has no influence upon that of labour. The money price of labour\nis necessarily regulated by two circumstances; the demand for labour, and\nthe price of the necessaries and conveniencies of life. The demand for\nlabour, according as it happens to be increasing, stationary, or\ndeclining, or to require an increasing, stationary, or declining\npopulation, determines the quantities of the necessaries and conveniencies\nof life which must be given to the labourer; and the money price of labour\nis determined by what is requisite for purchasing this quantity. Though\nthe money price of labour, therefore, is sometimes high where the price of\nprovisions is low, it would be still higher, the demand continuing the\nsame, if the price of provisions was high.\nIt is because the demand for labour increases in years of sudden and\nextraordinary plenty, and diminishes in those of sudden and extraordinary\nscarcity, that the money price of labour sometimes rises in the one, and\nsinks in the other.\nIn a year of sudden and extraordinary plenty, there are funds in the hands\nof many of the employers of industry, sufficient to maintain and employ a\ngreater number of industrious people than had been employed the year\nbefore; and this extraordinary number cannot always be had. Those masters,\ntherefore, who want more workmen, bid against one another, in order to get\nthem, which sometimes raises both the real and the money price of their\nlabour.\nThe contrary of this happens in a year of sudden and extraordinary\nscarcity. The funds destined for employing industry are less than they had\nbeen the year before. A considerable number of people are thrown out of\nemployment, who bid one against another, in order to get it, which\nsometimes lowers both the real and the money price of labour. In 1740, a\nyear of extraordinary scarcity, many people were willing to work for bare\nsubsistence. In the succeeding years of plenty, it was more difficult to\nget labourers and servants. The scarcity of a dear year, by diminishing\nthe demand for labour, tends to lower its price, as the high price of\nprovisions tends to raise it. The plenty of a cheap year, on the contrary,\nby increasing the demand, tends to raise the price of labour, as the\ncheapness of provisions tends to lower it. In the ordinary variations of\nthe prices of provisions, those two opposite causes seem to counterbalance\none another, which is probably, in part, the reason why the wages of\nlabour are everywhere so much more steady and permanent than the price of\nprovisions.\nThe increase in the wages of labour necessarily increases the price of\nmany commodities, by increasing that part of it which resolves itself into\nwages, and so far tends to diminish their consumption, both at home and\nabroad. The same cause, however, which raises the wages of labour, the\nincrease of stock, tends to increase its productive powers, and to make a\nsmaller quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work. The owner\nof the stock which employs a great number of labourers necessarily\nendeavours, for his own advantage, to make such a proper division and\ndistribution of employment, that they may be enabled to produce the\ngreatest quantity of work possible. For the same reason, he endeavours to\nsupply them with the best machinery which either he or they can think of.\nWhat takes place among the labourers in a particular workhouse, takes\nplace, for the same reason, among those of a great society. The greater\ntheir number, the more they naturally divide themselves into different\nclasses and subdivisions of employments. More heads are occupied in\ninventing the most proper machinery for executing the work of each, and it\nis, therefore, more likely to be invented. There are many commodities,\ntherefore, which, in consequence of these improvements, come to be\nproduced by so much less labour than before, that the increase of its\nprice is more than compensated by the diminution of its quantity.\nCHAPTER IX.\nOF THE PROFITS OF STOCK.\nThe rise and fall in the profits of stock depend upon the same causes with\nthe rise and fall in the wages of labour, the increasing or declining\nstate of the wealth of the society; but those causes affect the one and\nthe other very differently.\nThe increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When the\nstocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their mutual\ncompetition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is a like\nincrease of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same\nsociety, the same competition must produce the same effect in them all.\nIt is not easy, it has already been observed, to ascertain what are the\naverage wages of labour, even in a particular place, and at a particular\ntime. We can, even in this case, seldom determine more than what are the\nmost usual wages. But even this can seldom be done with regard to the\nprofits of stock. Profit is so very fluctuating, that the person who\ncarries on a particular trade, cannot always tell you himself what is the\naverage of his annual profit. It is affected, not only by every variation\nof price in the commodities which he deals in, but by the good or bad\nfortune both of his rivals and of his customers, and by a thousand other\naccidents, to which goods, when carried either by sea or by land, or even\nwhen stored in a warehouse, are liable. It varies, therefore, not only\nfrom year to year, but from day to day, and almost from hour to hour. To\nascertain what is the average profit of all the different trades carried\non in a great kingdom, must be much more difficult; and to judge of what\nit may have been formerly, or in remote periods of time, with any degree\nof precision, must be altogether impossible.\nBut though it may be impossible to determine, with any degree of\nprecision, what are or were the average profits of stock, either in the\npresent or in ancient times, some notion may be formed of them from the\ninterest of money. It may be laid down as a maxim, that wherever a great\ndeal can be made by the use of money, a great deal will commonly be given\nfor the use of it; and that, wherever little can be made by it, less will\ncommonly he given for it. Accordingly, therefore, as the usual market rate\nof interest varies in any country, we may be assured that the ordinary\nprofits of stock must vary with it, must sink as it sinks, and rise as it\nrises. The progress of interest, therefore, may lead us to form some\nnotion of the progress of profit.\nBy the 37th of Henry VIII. all interest above ten per cent. was declared\nunlawful. More, it seems, had sometimes been taken before that. In the\nreign of Edward VI. religious zeal prohibited all interest. This\nprohibition, however, like all others of the same kind, is said to have\nproduced no effect, and probably rather increased than diminished the evil\nof usury. The statute of Henry VIII. was revived by the 13th of Elizabeth,\ncap. 8. and ten per cent. continued to be the legal rate of interest till\nthe 21st of James I. when it was restricted to eight per cent. It was\nreduced to six per cent. soon after the Restoration, and by the 12th of\nQueen Anne, to five per cent. All these different statutory regulations\nseem to have been made with great propriety. They seem to have followed,\nand not to have gone before, the market rate of interest, or the rate at\nwhich people of good credit usually borrowed. Since the time of Queen\nAnne, five per cent. seems to have been rather above than below the market\nrate. Before the late war, the government borrowed at three per cent.; and\npeople of good credit in the capital, and in many other parts of the\nkingdom, at three and a-half, four, and four and a-half per cent.\nSince the time of Henry VIII. the wealth and revenue of the country have\nbeen continually advancing, and in the course of their progress, their\npace seems rather to have been gradually accelerated than retarded. They\nseem not only to have been going on, but to have been going on faster and\nfaster. The wages of labour have been continually increasing during the\nsame period, and, in the greater part of the different branches of trade\nand manufactures, the profits of stock have been diminishing.\nIt generally requires a greater stock to carry on any sort of trade in a\ngreat town than in a country village. The great stocks employed in every\nbranch of trade, and the number of rich competitors, generally reduce the\nrate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter. But the wages\nof labour are generally higher in a great town than in a country village.\nIn a thriving town, the people who have great stocks to employ, frequently\ncannot get the number of workmen they want, and therefore bid against one\nanother, in order to get as many as they can, which raises the wages of\nlabour, and lowers the profits of stock. In the remote parts of the\ncountry, there is frequently not stock sufficient to employ all the\npeople, who therefore bid against one another, in order to get employment,\nwhich lowers the wages of labour, and raises the profits of stock.\nIn Scotland, though the legal rate of interest is the same as in England,\nthe market rate is rather higher. People of the best credit there seldom\nborrow under five per cent. Even private bankers in Edinburgh give four\nper cent. upon their promissory-notes, of which payment, either in whole\nor in part may be demanded at pleasure. Private bankers in London give no\ninterest for the money which is deposited with them. There are few trades\nwhich cannot be carried on with a smaller stock in Scotland than in\nEngland. The common rate of profit, therefore, must be somewhat greater.\nThe wages of labour, it has already been observed, are lower in Scotland\nthan in England. The country, too, is not only much poorer, but the steps\nby which it advances to a better condition, for it is evidently advancing,\nseem to be much slower and more tardy. The legal rate of interest in\nFrance has not during the course of the present century, been always\nregulated by the market rate {See Denisart, Article Taux des Interests,\ntom. iii, p.13}. In 1720, interest was reduced from the twentieth to the\nfiftieth penny, or from five to two per cent. In 1724, it was raised to\nthe thirtieth penny, or to three and a third per cent. In 1725, it was\nagain raised to the twentieth penny, or to five per cent. In 1766, during\nthe administration of Mr Laverdy, it was reduced to the twenty-fifth\npenny, or to four per cent. The Abb\u00e9 Terray raised it afterwards to the\nold rate of five per cent. The supposed purpose of many of those violent\nreductions of interest was to prepare the way for reducing that of the\npublic debts; a purpose which has sometimes been executed. France is,\nperhaps, in the present times, not so rich a country as England; and\nthough the legal rate of interest has in France frequently been lower than\nin England, the market rate has generally been higher; for there, as in\nother countries, they have several very safe and easy methods of evading\nthe law. The profits of trade, I have been assured by British merchants\nwho had traded in both countries, are higher in France than in England;\nand it is no doubt upon this account, that many British subjects chuse\nrather to employ their capitals in a country where trade is in disgrace,\nthan in one where it is highly respected. The wages of labour are lower in\nFrance than in England. When you go from Scotland to England, the\ndifference which you may remark between the dress and countenance of the\ncommon people in the one country and in the other, sufficiently indicates\nthe difference in their condition. The contrast is still greater when you\nreturn from France. France, though no doubt a richer country than\nScotland, seems not to be going forward so fast. It is a common and even a\npopular opinion in the country, that it is going backwards; an opinion\nwhich I apprehend, is ill-founded, even with regard to France, but which\nnobody can possibly entertain with regard to Scotland, who sees the\ncountry now, and who saw it twenty or thirty years ago.\nThe province of Holland, on the other hand, in proportion to the extent of\nits territory and the number of its people, is a richer country than\nEngland. The government there borrow at two per cent. and private people\nof good credit at three. The wages of labour are said to be higher in\nHolland than in England, and the Dutch, it is well known, trade upon lower\nprofits than any people in Europe. The trade of Holland, it has been\npretended by some people, is decaying, and it may perhaps be true that\nsome particular branches of it are so; but these symptoms seem to indicate\nsufficiently that there is no general decay. When profit diminishes,\nmerchants are very apt to complain that trade decays, though the\ndiminution of profit is the natural effect of its prosperity, or of a\ngreater stock being employed in it than before. During the late war, the\nDutch gained the whole carrying trade of France, of which they still\nretain a very large share. The great property which they possess both in\nFrench and English funds, about forty millions, it is said in the latter\n(in which, I suspect, however, there is a considerable exaggeration ), the\ngreat sums which they lend to private people, in countries where the rate\nof interest is higher than in their own, are circumstances which no doubt\ndemonstrate the redundancy of their stock, or that it has increased beyond\nwhat they can employ with tolerable profit in the proper business of their\nown country; but they do not demonstrate that that business has decreased.\nAs the capital of a private man, though acquired by a particular trade,\nmay increase beyond what he can employ in it, and yet that trade continue\nto increase too, so may likewise the capital of a great nation.\nIn our North American and West Indian colonies, not only the wages of\nlabour, but the interest of money, and consequently the profits of stock,\nare higher than in England. In the different colonies, both the legal and\nthe market rate of interest run from six to eight percent. High wages of\nlabour and high profits of stock, however, are things, perhaps, which\nscarce ever go together, except in the peculiar circumstances of new\ncolonies. A new colony must always, for some time, be more understocked in\nproportion to the extent of its territory, and more underpeopled in\nproportion to the extent of its stock, than the greater part of other\ncountries. They have more land than they have stock to cultivate. What\nthey have, therefore, is applied to the cultivation only of what is most\nfertile and most favourably situated, the land near the sea-shore, and\nalong the banks of navigable rivers. Such land, too, is frequently\npurchased at a price below the value even of its natural produce. Stock\nemployed in the purchase and improvement of such lands, must yield a very\nlarge profit, and, consequently, afford to pay a very large interest. Its\nrapid accumulation in so profitable an employment enables the planter to\nincrease the number of his hands faster than he can find them in a new\nsettlement. Those whom he can find, therefore, are very liberally\nrewarded. As the colony increases, the profits of stock gradually\ndiminish. When the most fertile and best situated lands have been all\noccupied, less profit can be made by the cultivation of what is inferior\nboth in soil and situation, and less interest can be afforded for the\nstock which is so employed. In the greater part of our colonies,\naccordingly, both the legal and the market rate of interest have been\nconsiderably reduced during the course of the present century. As riches,\nimprovement, and population, have increased, interest has declined. The\nwages of labour do not sink with the profits of stock. The demand for\nlabour increases with the increase of stock, whatever be its profits; and\nafter these are diminished, stock may not only continue to increase, but\nto increase much faster than before. It is with industrious nations, who\nare advancing in the acquisition of riches, as with industrious\nindividuals. A great stock, though with small profits, generally increases\nfaster than a small stock with great profits. Money, says the proverb,\nmakes money. When you have got a little, it is often easy to get more. The\ngreat difficulty is to get that little. The connection between the\nincrease of stock and that of industry, or of the demand for useful\nlabour, has partly been explained already, but will be explained more\nfully hereafter, in treating of the accumulation of stock.\nThe acquisition of new territory, or of new branches of trade, may\nsometimes raise the profits of stock, and with them the interest of money,\neven in a country which is fast advancing in the acquisition of riches.\nThe stock of the country, not being sufficient for the whole accession of\nbusiness which such acquisitions present to the different people among\nwhom it is divided, is applied to those particular branches only which\nafford the greatest profit. Part of what had before been employed in other\ntrades, is necessarily withdrawn from them, and turned into some of the\nnew and more profitable ones. In all those old trades, therefore, the\ncompetition comes to be less than before. The market comes to be less\nfully supplied with many different sorts of goods. Their price necessarily\nrises more or less, and yields a greater profit to those who deal in them,\nwho can, therefore, afford to borrow at a higher interest. For some time\nafter the conclusion of the late war, not only private people of the best\ncredit, but some of the greatest companies in London, commonly borrowed at\nfive per cent. who, before that, had not been used to pay more than four,\nand four and a half per cent. The great accession both of territory and\ntrade by our acquisitions in North America and the West Indies, will\nsufficiently account for this, without supposing any diminution in the\ncapital stock of the society. So great an accession of new business to be\ncarried on by the old stock, must necessarily have diminished the quantity\nemployed in a great number of particular branches, in which the\ncompetition being less, the profits must have been greater. I shall\nhereafter have occasion to mention the reasons which dispose me to believe\nthat the capital stock of Great Britain was not diminished, even by the\nenormous expense of the late war.\nThe diminution of the capital stock of the society, or of the funds\ndestined for the maintenance of industry, however, as it lowers the wages\nof labour, so it raises the profits of stock, and consequently the\ninterest of money. By the wages of labour being lowered, the owners of\nwhat stock remains in the society can bring their goods at less expense to\nmarket than before; and less stock being employed in supplying the market\nthan before, they can sell them dearer. Their goods cost them less, and\nthey get more for them. Their profits, therefore, being augmented at both\nends, can well afford a large interest. The great fortunes so suddenly and\nso easily acquired in Bengal and the other British settlements in the East\nIndies, may satisfy us, that as the wages of labour are very low, so the\nprofits of stock are very high in those ruined countries. The interest of\nmoney is proportionably so. In Bengal, money is frequently lent to the\nfarmers at forty, fifty, and sixty per cent. and the succeeding crop is\nmortgaged for the payment. As the profits which can afford such an\ninterest must eat up almost the whole rent of the landlord, so such\nenormous usury must in its turn eat up the greater part of those profits.\nBefore the fall of the Roman republic, a usury of the same kind seems to\nhave been common in the provinces, under the ruinous administration of\ntheir proconsuls. The virtuous Brutus lent money in Cyprus at\neight-and-forty per cent. as we learn from the letters of Cicero.\nIn a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the\nnature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other\ncountries, allowed it to acquire, which could, therefore, advance no\nfurther, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and\nthe profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully\npeopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain, or its\nstock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great\nas to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up\nthe number of labourers, and the country being already fully peopled, that\nnumber could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion\nto all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would\nbe employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the\ntrade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as\ngreat, and, consequently, the ordinary profit as low as possible.\nBut, perhaps, no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.\nChina seems to have been long stationary, and had, probably, long ago\nacquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the\nnature of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much\ninferior to what, with other laws and institutions, the nature of its\nsoil, climate, and situation, might admit of. A country which neglects or\ndespises foreign commerce, and which admits the vessel of foreign nations\ninto one or two of its ports only, cannot transact the same quantity of\nbusiness which it might do with different laws and institutions. In a\ncountry, too, where, though the rich, or the owners of large capitals,\nenjoy a good deal of security, the poor, or the owners of small capitals,\nenjoy scarce any, but are liable, under the pretence of justice, to be\npillaged and plundered at any time by the inferior mandarins, the quantity\nof stock employed in all the different branches of business transacted\nwithin it, can never be equal to what the nature and extent of that\nbusiness might admit. In every different branch, the oppression of the\npoor must establish the monopoly of the rich, who, by engrossing the whole\ntrade to themselves, will be able to make very large profits. Twelve per\ncent. accordingly, is said to be the common interest of money in China,\nand the ordinary profits of stock must be sufficient to afford this large\ninterest.\nA defect in the law may sometimes raise the rate of interest considerably\nabove what the condition of the country, as to wealth or poverty, would\nrequire. When the law does not enforce the performance of contracts, it\nputs all borrowers nearly upon the same footing with bankrupts, or people\nof doubtful credit, in better regulated countries. The uncertainty of\nrecovering his money makes the lender exact the same usurious interest\nwhich is usually required from bankrupts. Among the barbarous nations who\noverran the western provinces of the Roman empire, the performance of\ncontracts was left for many ages to the faith of the contracting parties.\nThe courts of justice of their kings seldom intermeddled in it. The high\nrate of interest which took place in those ancient times, may, perhaps, be\npartly accounted for from this cause.\nWhen the law prohibits interest altogether, it does not prevent it. Many\npeople must borrow, and nobody will lend without such a consideration for\nthe use of their money as is suitable, not only to what can be made by the\nuse of it, but to the difficulty and danger of evading the law. The high\nrate of interest among all Mahometan nations is accounted for by M.\nMontesquieu, not from their poverty, but partly from this, and partly from\nthe difficulty of recovering the money.\nThe lowest ordinary rate of profit must always be something more than what\nis sufficient to compensate the occasional losses to which every\nemployment of stock is exposed. It is this surplus only which is neat or\nclear profit. What is called gross profit, comprehends frequently not only\nthis surplus, but what is retained for compensating such extraordinary\nlosses. The interest which the borrower can afford to pay is in proportion\nto the clear profit only. The lowest ordinary rate of interest must, in\nthe same manner, be something more than sufficient to compensate the\noccasional losses to which lending, even with tolerable prudence, is\nexposed. Were it not, mere charity or friendship could be the only motives\nfor lending.\nIn a country which had acquired its full complement of riches, where, in\nevery particular branch of business, there was the greatest quantity of\nstock that could be employed in it, as the ordinary rate of clear profit\nwould be very small, so the usual market rate of interest which could be\nafforded out of it would be so low as to render it impossible for any but\nthe very wealthiest people to live upon the interest of their money. All\npeople of small or middling fortunes would be obliged to superintend\nthemselves the employment of their own stocks. It would be necessary that\nalmost every man should be a man of business, or engage in some sort of\ntrade. The province of Holland seems to be approaching near to this state.\nIt is there unfashionable not to be a man of business. Necessity makes it\nusual for almost every man to be so, and custom everywhere regulates\nfashion. As it is ridiculous not to dress, so is it, in some measure, not\nto be employed like other people. As a man of a civil profession seems\nawkward in a camp or a garrison, and is even in some danger of being\ndespised there, so does an idle man among men of business.\nThe highest ordinary rate of profit may be such as, in the price of the\ngreater part of commodities, eats up the whole of what should go to the\nrent of the land, and leaves only what is sufficient to pay the labour of\npreparing and bringing them to market, according to the lowest rate at\nwhich labour can anywhere be paid, the bare subsistence of the labourer.\nThe workman must always have been fed in some way or other while he was\nabout the work, but the landlord may not always have been paid. The\nprofits of the trade which the servants of the East India Company carry on\nin Bengal may not, perhaps, be very far from this rate.\nThe proportion which the usual market rate of interest ought to bear to\nthe ordinary rate of clear profit, necessarily varies as profit rises or\nfalls. Double interest is in Great Britain reckoned what the merchants\ncall a good, moderate, reasonable profit; terms which, I apprehend, mean\nno more than a common and usual profit. In a country where the ordinary\nrate of clear profit is eight or ten per cent. it may be reasonable that\none half of it should go to interest, wherever business is carried on with\nborrowed money. The stock is at the risk of the borrower, who, as it were,\ninsures it to the lender; and four or five per cent. may, in the greater\npart of trades, be both a sufficient profit upon the risk of this\ninsurance, and a sufficient recompence for the trouble of employing the\nstock. But the proportion between interest and clear profit might not be\nthe same in countries where the ordinary rate of profit was either a good\ndeal lower, or a good deal higher. If it were a good deal lower, one half\nof it, perhaps, could not be afforded for interest; and more might be\nafforded if it were a good deal higher.\nIn countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit\nmay, in the price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of\nlabour, and enable those countries to sell as cheap as their less thriving\nneighbours, among whom the wages of labour may be lower.\nIn reality, high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than\nhigh wages. If, in the linen manufacture, for example, the wages of the\ndifferent working people, the flax-dressers, the spinners, the weavers,\netc. should all of them be advanced twopence a-day, it would be necessary\nto heighten the price of a piece of linen only by a number of twopences\nequal to the number of people that had been employed about it, multiplied\nby the number of days during which they had been so employed. That part of\nthe price of the commodity which resolved itself into the wages, would,\nthrough all the different stages of the manufacture, rise only in\narithmetical proportion to this rise of wages. But if the profits of all\nthe different employers of those working people should be raised five per\ncent. that part of the price of the commodity which resolved itself into\nprofit would, through all the different stages of the manufacture, rise in\ngeometrical proportion to this rise of profit. The employer of the flax\ndressers would, in selling his flax, require an additional five per cent.\nupon the whole value of the materials and wages which he advanced to his\nworkmen. The employer of the spinners would require an additional five per\ncent. both upon the advanced price of the flax, and upon the wages of the\nspinners. And the employer of the weavers would require alike five per\ncent. both upon the advanced price of the linen-yarn, and upon the wages\nof the weavers. In raising the price of commodities, the rise of wages\noperates in the same manner as simple interest does in the accumulation of\ndebt. The rise of profit operates like compound interest. Our merchants\nand master manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in\nraising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their goods, both at\nhome and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high\nprofits; they are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their\nown gains; they complain only of those of other people.\nCHAPTER X.\nOF WAGES AND PROFIT IN THE DIFFERENT\nEMPLOYMENTS OF LABOUR AND STOCK.\nThe whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments\nof labour and stock, must, in the same neighbourhood, be either perfectly\nequal, or continually tending to equality. If, in the same neighbourhood,\nthere was any employment evidently either more or less advantageous than\nthe rest, so many people would crowd into it in the one case, and so many\nwould desert it in the other, that its advantages would soon return to the\nlevel of other employments. This, at least, would be the case in a society\nwhere things were left to follow their natural course, where there was\nperfect liberty, and where every man was perfectly free both to choose\nwhat occupation he thought proper, and to change it as often as he thought\nproper. Every man\u2019s interest would prompt him to seek the advantageous,\nand to shun the disadvantageous employment.\nPecuniary wages and profit, indeed, are everywhere in Europe extremely\ndifferent, according to the different employments of labour and stock. But\nthis difference arises, partly from certain circumstances in the\nemployments themselves, which, either really, or at least in the\nimagination of men, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and\ncounterbalance a great one in others, and partly from the policy of\nEurope, which nowhere leaves things at perfect liberty.\nThe particular consideration of those circumstances, and of that policy,\nwill divide this Chapter into two parts.\nPART I. Inequalities arising from the nature of the employments\nthemselves.\nThe five following are the principal circumstances which, so far as I have\nbeen able to observe, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some\nemployments, and counterbalance a great one in others. First, the\nagreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves; secondly,\nthe easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense of learning\nthem; thirdly, the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them;\nfourthly, the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who\nexercise them; and, fifthly, the probability or improbability of success\nin them.\nFirst, the wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness\nor dirtiness, the honourableness or dishonourableness, of the employment.\nThus in most places, take the year round, a journeyman tailor earns less\nthan a journeyman weaver. His work is much easier. A journeyman weaver\nearns less than a journeyman smith. His work is not always easier, but it\nis much cleanlier. A journeyman blacksmith, though an artificer, seldom\nearns so much in twelve hours, as a collier, who is only a labourer, does\nin eight. His work is not quite so dirty, is less dangerous, and is\ncarried on in day-light, and above ground. Honour makes a great part of\nthe reward of all honourable professions. In point of pecuniary gain, all\nthings considered, they are generally under-recompensed, as I shall\nendeavour to shew by and by. Disgrace has the contrary effect. The trade\nof a butcher is a brutal and an odious business; but it is in most places\nmore profitable than the greater part of common trades. The most\ndetestable of all employments, that of public executioner, is, in\nproportion to the quantity of work done, better paid than any common trade\nwhatever.\nHunting and fishing, the most important employments of mankind in the rude\nstate of society, become, in its advanced state, their most agreeable\namusements, and they pursue for pleasure what they once followed from\nnecessity. In the advanced state of society, therefore, they are all very\npoor people who follow as a trade, what other people pursue as a pastime.\nFishermen have been so since the time of Theocritus. {See Idyllium xxi.}.\nA poacher is everywhere a very poor man in Great Britain. In countries\nwhere the rigour of the law suffers no poachers, the licensed hunter is\nnot in a much better condition. The natural taste for those employments\nmakes more people follow them, than can live comfortably by them; and the\nproduce of their labour, in proportion to its quantity, comes always too\ncheap to market, to afford any thing but the most scanty subsistence to\nthe labourers.\nDisagreeableness and disgrace affect the profits of stock in the same\nmanner as the wages of labour. The keeper of an inn or tavern, who is\nnever master of his own house, and who is exposed to the brutality of\nevery drunkard, exercises neither a very agreeable nor a very creditable\nbusiness. But there is scarce any common trade in which a small stock\nyields so great a profit.\nSecondly, the wages of labour vary with the easiness and cheapness, or the\ndifficulty and expense, of learning the business.\nWhen any expensive machine is erected, the extraordinary work to be\nperformed by it before it is worn out, it must be expected, will replace\nthe capital laid out upon it, with at least the ordinary profits. A man\neducated at the expense of much labour and time to any of those\nemployments which require extraordinary dexterity and skill, may be\ncompared to one of those expensive machines. The work which he learns to\nperform, it must be expected, over and above the usual wages of common\nlabour, will replace to him the whole expense of his education, with at\nleast the ordinary profits of an equally valuable capital. It must do this\ntoo in a reasonable time, regard being had to the very uncertain duration\nof human life, in the same manner as to the more certain duration of the\nmachine.\nThe difference between the wages of skilled labour and those of common\nlabour, is founded upon this principle.\nThe policy of Europe considers the labour of all mechanics, artificers,\nand manufacturers, as skilled labour; and that of all country labourers as\ncommon labour. It seems to suppose that of the former to be of a more nice\nand delicate nature than that of the latter. It is so perhaps in some\ncases; but in the greater part it is quite otherwise, as I shall endeavour\nto shew by and by. The laws and customs of Europe, therefore, in order to\nqualify any person for exercising the one species of labour, impose the\nnecessity of an apprenticeship, though with different degrees of rigour in\ndifferent places. They leave the other free and open to every body. During\nthe continuance of the apprenticeship, the whole labour of the apprentice\nbelongs to his master. In the meantime he must, in many cases, be\nmaintained by his parents or relations, and, in almost all cases, must be\nclothed by them. Some money, too, is commonly given to the master for\nteaching him his trade. They who cannot give money, give time, or become\nbound for more than the usual number of years; a consideration which,\nthough it is not always advantageous to the master, on account of the\nusual idleness of apprentices, is always disadvantageous to the\napprentice. In country labour, on the contrary, the labourer, while he is\nemployed about the easier, learns the more difficult parts of his\nbusiness, and his own labour maintains him through all the different\nstages of his employment. It is reasonable, therefore, that in Europe the\nwages of mechanics, artificers, and manufacturers, should be somewhat\nhigher than those of common labourers. They are so accordingly, and their\nsuperior gains make them, in most places, be considered as a superior rank\nof people. This superiority, however, is generally very small: the daily\nor weekly earnings of journeymen in the more common sorts of manufactures,\nsuch as those of plain linen and woollen cloth, computed at an average,\nare, in most places, very little more than the day-wages of common\nlabourers. Their employment, indeed, is more steady and uniform, and the\nsuperiority of their earnings, taking the whole year together, may be\nsomewhat greater. It seems evidently, however, to be no greater than what\nis sufficient to compensate the superior expense of their education.\nEducation in the ingenious arts, and in the liberal professions, is still\nmore tedious and expensive. The pecuniary recompence, therefore, of\npainters and sculptors, of lawyers and physicians, ought to be much more\nliberal; and it is so accordingly.\nThe profits of stock seem to be very little affected by the easiness or\ndifficulty of learning the trade in which it is employed. All the\ndifferent ways in which stock is commonly employed in great towns seem, in\nreality, to be almost equally easy and equally difficult to learn. One\nbranch, either of foreign or domestic trade, cannot well be a much more\nintricate business than another.\nThirdly, the wages of labour in different occupations vary with the\nconstancy or inconstancy of employment.\nEmployment is much more constant in some trades than in others. In the\ngreater part of manufactures, a journeyman maybe pretty sure of employment\nalmost every day in the year that he is able to work. A mason or\nbricklayer, on the contrary, can work neither in hard frost nor in foul\nweather, and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional\ncalls of his customers. He is liable, in consequence, to be frequently\nwithout any. What he earns, therefore, while he is employed, must not only\nmaintain him while he is idle, but make him some compensation for those\nanxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a\nsituation must sometimes occasion. Where the computed earnings of the\ngreater part of manufacturers, accordingly, are nearly upon a level with\nthe day-wages of common labourers, those of masons and bricklayers are\ngenerally from one-half more to double those wages. Where common labourers\nearn four or five shillings a-week, masons and bricklayers frequently earn\nseven and eight; where the former earn six, the latter often earn nine and\nten; and where the former earn nine and ten, as in London, the latter\ncommonly earn fifteen and eighteen. No species of skilled labour, however,\nseems more easy to learn than that of masons and bricklayers. Chairmen in\nLondon, during the summer season, are said sometimes to be employed as\nbricklayers. The high wages of those workmen, therefore, are not so much\nthe recompence of their skill, as the compensation for the inconstancy of\ntheir employment.\nA house-carpenter seems to exercise rather a nicer and a more ingenious\ntrade than a mason. In most places, however, for it is not universally so,\nhis day-wages are somewhat lower. His employment, though it depends much,\ndoes not depend so entirely upon the occasional calls of his customers;\nand it is not liable to be interrupted by the weather.\nWhen the trades which generally afford constant employment, happen in a\nparticular place not to do so, the wages of the workmen always rise a good\ndeal above their ordinary proportion to those of common labour. In London,\nalmost all journeymen artificers are liable to be called upon and\ndismissed by their masters from day to day, and from week to week, in the\nsame manner as day-labourers in other places. The lowest order of\nartificers, journeymen tailors, accordingly, earn their half-a-crown\na-day, though eighteen pence may be reckoned the wages of common labour.\nIn small towns and country villages, the wages of journeymen tailors\nfrequently scarce equal those of common labour; but in London they are\noften many weeks without employment, particularly during the summer.\nWhen the inconstancy of employment is combined with the hardship,\ndisagreeableness, and dirtiness of the work, it sometimes raises the wages\nof the most common labour above those of the most skilful artificers. A\ncollier working by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly\nabout double, and, in many parts of Scotland, about three times, the wages\nof common labour. His high wages arise altogether from the hardship,\ndisagreeableness, and dirtiness of his work. His employment may, upon most\noccasions, be as constant as he pleases. The coal-heavers in London\nexercise a trade which, in hardship, dirtiness, and disagreeableness,\nalmost equals that of colliers; and, from the unavoidable irregularity in\nthe arrivals of coal-ships, the employment of the greater part of them is\nnecessarily very inconstant. If colliers, therefore, commonly earn double\nand triple the wages of common labour, it ought not to seem unreasonable\nthat coal-heavers should sometimes earn four and five times those wages.\nIn the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago, it was found\nthat, at the rate at which they were then paid, they could earn from six\nto ten shillings a-day. Six shillings are about four times the wages of\ncommon labour in London; and, in every particular trade, the lowest common\nearnings may always be considered as those of the far greater number. How\nextravagant soever those earnings may appear, if they were more than\nsufficient to compensate all the disagreeable circumstances of the\nbusiness, there would soon be so great a number of competitors, as, in a\ntrade which has no exclusive privilege, would quickly reduce them to a\nlower rate.\nThe constancy or inconstancy of employment cannot affect the ordinary\nprofits of stock in any particular trade. Whether the stock is or is not\nconstantly employed, depends, not upon the trade, but the trader.\nFourthly, the wages of labour vary according to the small or great trust\nwhich must be reposed in the workmen.\nThe wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are everywhere superior to those of\nmany other workmen, not only of equal, but of much superior ingenuity, on\naccount of the precious materials with which they are entrusted. We trust\nour health to the physician, our fortune, and sometimes our life and\nreputation, to the lawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not safely\nbe reposed in people of a very mean or low condition. Their reward must be\nsuch, therefore, as may give them that rank in the society which so\nimportant a trust requires. The long time and the great expense which must\nbe laid out in their education, when combined with this circumstance,\nnecessarily enhance still further the price of their labour.\nWhen a person employs only his own stock in trade, there is no trust; and\nthe credit which he may get from other people, depends, not upon the\nnature of the trade, but upon their opinion of his fortune, probity and\nprudence. The different rates of profit, therefore, in the different\nbranches of trade, cannot arise from the different degrees of trust\nreposed in the traders.\nFifthly, the wages of labour in different employments vary according to\nthe probability or improbability of success in them.\nThe probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for the\nemployments to which he is educated, is very different in different\noccupations. In the greatest part of mechanic trades success is almost\ncertain; but very uncertain in the liberal professions. Put your son\napprentice to a shoemaker, there is little doubt of his learning to make a\npair of shoes; but send him to study the law, it as at least twenty to one\nif he ever makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the\nbusiness. In a perfectly fair lottery, those who draw the prizes ought to\ngain all that is lost by those who draw the blanks. In a profession, where\ntwenty fail for one that succeeds, that one ought to gain all that should\nhave been gained by the unsuccessful twenty. The counsellor at law, who,\nperhaps, at near forty years of age, begins to make something by his\nprofession, ought to receive the retribution, not only of his own so\ntedious and expensive education, but of that of more than twenty others,\nwho are never likely to make any thing by it. How extravagant soever the\nfees of counsellors at law may sometimes appear, their real retribution is\nnever equal to this. Compute, in any particular place, what is likely to\nbe annually gained, and what is likely to be annually spent, by all the\ndifferent workmen in any common trade, such as that of shoemakers or\nweavers, and you will find that the former sum will generally exceed the\nlatter. But make the same computation with regard to all the counsellors\nand students of law, in all the different Inns of Court, and you will find\nthat their annual gains bear but a very small proportion to their annual\nexpense, even though you rate the former as high, and the latter as low,\nas can well be done. The lottery of the law, therefore, is very far from\nbeing a perfectly fair lottery; and that as well as many other liberal and\nhonourable professions, is, in point of pecuniary gain, evidently\nunder-recompensed.\nThose professions keep their level, however, with other occupations; and,\nnotwithstanding these discouragements, all the most generous and liberal\nspirits are eager to crowd into them. Two different causes contribute to\nrecommend them. First, the desire of the reputation which attends upon\nsuperior excellence in any of them; and, secondly, the natural confidence\nwhich every man has, more or less, not only in his own abilities, but in\nhis own good fortune.\nTo excel in any profession, in which but few arrive at mediocrity, is the\nmost decisive mark of what is called genius, or superior talents. The\npublic admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities makes\nalways a part of their reward; a greater or smaller, in proportion as it\nis higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward\nin the profession of physic; a still greater, perhaps, in that of law; in\npoetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\nThere are some very agreeable and beautiful talents, of which the\npossession commands a certain sort of admiration, but of which the\nexercise, for the sake of gain, is considered, whether from reason or\nprejudice, as a sort of public prostitution. The pecuniary recompence,\ntherefore, of those who exercise them in this manner, must be sufficient,\nnot only to pay for the time, labour, and expense of acquiring the\ntalents, but for the discredit which attends the employment of them as the\nmeans of subsistence. The exorbitant rewards of players, opera-singers,\nopera-dancers, etc. are founded upon those two principles; the rarity and\nbeauty of the talents, and the discredit of employing them in this manner.\nIt seems absurd at first sight, that we should despise their persons, and\nyet reward their talents with the most profuse liberality. While we do the\none, however, we must of necessity do the other, Should the public opinion\nor prejudice ever alter with regard to such occupations, their pecuniary\nrecompence would quickly diminish. More people would apply to them, and\nthe competition would quickly reduce the price of their labour. Such\ntalents, though far from being common, are by no means so rare as\nimagined. Many people possess them in great perfection, who disdain to\nmake this use of them; and many more are capable of acquiring them, if any\nthing could be made honourably by them.\nThe over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own\nabilities, is an ancient evil remarked by the philosophers and moralists\nof all ages. Their absurd presumption in their own good fortune has been\nless taken notice of. It is, however, if possible, still more universal.\nThere is no man living, who, when in tolerable health and spirits, has not\nsome share of it. The chance of gain is by every man more or less\nover-valued, and the chance of loss is by most men under-valued, and by\nscarce any man, who is in tolerable health and spirits, valued more than\nit is worth.\nThat the chance of gain is naturally overvalued, we may learn from the\nuniversal success of lotteries. The world neither ever saw, nor ever will\nsee, a perfectly fair lottery, or one in which the whole gain compensated\nthe whole loss; because the undertaker could make nothing by it. In the\nstate lotteries, the tickets are really not worth the price which is paid\nby the original subscribers, and yet commonly sell in the market for\ntwenty, thirty, and sometimes forty per cent. advance. The vain hopes of\ngaining some of the great prizes is the sole cause of this demand. The\nsoberest people scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a small sum for the\nchance of gaining ten or twenty thousand pounds, though they know that\neven that small sum is perhaps twenty or thirty per cent. more than the\nchance is worth. In a lottery in which no prize exceeded twenty pounds,\nthough in other respects it approached much nearer to a perfectly fair one\nthan the common state lotteries, there would not be the same demand for\ntickets. In order to have a better chance for some of the great prizes,\nsome people purchase several tickets; and others, small shares in a still\ngreater number. There is not, however, a more certain proposition in\nmathematics, than that the more tickets you adventure upon, the more\nlikely you are to be a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the\nlottery, and you lose for certain; and the greater the number of your\ntickets, the nearer you approach to this certainty.\nThat the chance of loss is frequently undervalued, and scarce ever valued\nmore than it is worth, we may learn from the very moderate profit of\ninsurers. In order to make insurance, either from fire or sea-risk, a\ntrade at all, the common premium must be sufficient to compensate the\ncommon losses, to pay the expense of management, and to afford such a\nprofit as might have been drawn from an equal capital employed in any\ncommon trade. The person who pays no more than this, evidently pays no\nmore than the real value of the risk, or the lowest price at which he can\nreasonably expect to insure it. But though many people have made a little\nmoney by insurance, very few have made a great fortune; and, from this\nconsideration alone, it seems evident enough that the ordinary balance of\nprofit and loss is not more advantageous in this than in other common\ntrades, by which so many people make fortunes. Moderate, however, as the\npremium of insurance commonly is, many people despise the risk too much to\ncare to pay it. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, nineteen houses in\ntwenty, or rather, perhaps, ninety-nine in a hundred, are not insured from\nfire. Sea-risk is more alarming to the greater part of people; and the\nproportion of ships insured to those not insured is much greater. Many\nsail, however, at all seasons, and even in time of war, without any\ninsurance. This may sometimes, perhaps, be done without any imprudence.\nWhen a great company, or even a great merchant, has twenty or thirty ships\nat sea, they may, as it were, insure one another. The premium saved up on\nthem all may more than compensate such losses as they are likely to meet\nwith in the common course of chances. The neglect of insurance upon\nshipping, however, in the same manner as upon houses, is, in most cases,\nthe effect of no such nice calculation, but of mere thoughtless rashness,\nand presumptuous contempt of the risk.\nThe contempt of risk, and the presumptuous hope of success, are in no\nperiod of life more active than at the age at which young people choose\ntheir professions. How little the fear of misfortune is then capable of\nbalancing the hope of good luck, appears still more evidently in the\nreadiness of the common people to enlist as soldiers, or to go to sea,\nthan in the eagerness of those of better fashion to enter into what are\ncalled the liberal professions.\nWhat a common soldier may lose is obvious enough. Without regarding the\ndanger, however, young volunteers never enlist so readily as at the\nbeginning of a new war; and though they have scarce any chance of\npreferment, they figure to themselves, in their youthful fancies, a\nthousand occasions of acquiring honour and distinction which never occur.\nThese romantic hopes make the whole price of their blood. Their pay is\nless than that of common labourers, and, in actual service, their fatigues\nare much greater.\nThe lottery of the sea is not altogether so disadvantageous as that of the\narmy. The son of a creditable labourer or artificer may frequently go to\nsea with his father\u2019s consent; but if he enlists as a soldier, it is\nalways without it. Other people see some chance of his making something by\nthe one trade; nobody but himself sees any of his making any thing by the\nother. The great admiral is less the object of public admiration than the\ngreat general; and the highest success in the sea service promises a less\nbrilliant fortune and reputation than equal success in the land. The same\ndifference runs through all the inferior degrees of preferment in both. By\nthe rules of precedency, a captain in the navy ranks with a colonel in the\narmy; but he does not rank with him in the common estimation. As the great\nprizes in the lottery are less, the smaller ones must be more numerous.\nCommon sailors, therefore, more frequently get some fortune and preferment\nthan common soldiers; and the hope of those prizes is what principally\nrecommends the trade. Though their skill and dexterity are much superior\nto that of almost any artificers; and though their whole life is one\ncontinual scene of hardship and danger; yet for all this dexterity and\nskill, for all those hardships and dangers, while they remain in the\ncondition of common sailors, they receive scarce any other recompence but\nthe pleasure of exercising the one and of surmounting the other. Their\nwages are not greater than those of common labourers at the port which\nregulates the rate of seamen\u2019s wages. As they are continually going from\nport to port, the monthly pay of those who sail from all the different\nports of Great Britain, is more nearly upon a level than that of any other\nworkmen in those different places; and the rate of the port to and from\nwhich the greatest number sail, that is, the port of London, regulates\nthat of all the rest. At London, the wages of the greater part of the\ndifferent classes of workmen are about double those of the same classes at\nEdinburgh. But the sailors who sail from the port of London, seldom earn\nabove three or four shillings a month more than those who sail from the\nport of Leith, and the difference is frequently not so great. In time of\npeace, and in the merchant-service, the London price is from a guinea to\nabout seven-and-twenty shillings the calendar month. A common labourer in\nLondon, at the rate of nine or ten shillings a week, may earn in the\ncalendar month from forty to five-and-forty shillings. The sailor, indeed,\nover and above his pay, is supplied with provisions. Their value, however,\nmay not perhaps always exceed the difference between his pay and that of\nthe common labourer; and though it sometimes should, the excess will not\nbe clear gain to the sailor, because he cannot share it with his wife and\nfamily, whom he must maintain out of his wages at home.\nThe dangers and hair-breadth escapes of a life of adventures, instead of\ndisheartening young people, seem frequently to recommend a trade to them.\nA tender mother, among the inferior ranks of people, is often afraid to\nsend her son to school at a sea-port town, lest the sight of the ships,\nand the conversation and adventures of the sailors, should entice him to\ngo to sea. The distant prospect of hazards, from which we can hope to\nextricate ourselves by courage and address, is not disagreeable to us, and\ndoes not raise the wages of labour in any employment. It is otherwise with\nthose in which courage and address can be of no avail. In trades which are\nknown to be very unwholesome, the wages of labour are always remarkably\nhigh. Unwholesomeness is a species of disagreeableness, and its effects\nupon the wages of labour are to be ranked under that general head.\nIn all the different employments of stock, the ordinary rate of profit\nvaries more or less with the certainty or uncertainty of the returns.\nThese are, in general, less uncertain in the inland than in the foreign\ntrade, and in some branches of foreign trade than in others; in the trade\nto North America, for example, than in that to Jamaica. The ordinary rate\nof profit always rises more or less with the risk. It does not, however,\nseem to rise in proportion to it, or so as to compensate it completely.\nBankruptcies are most frequent in the most hazardous trades. The most\nhazardous of all trades, that of a smuggler, though, when the adventure\nsucceeds, it is likewise the most profitable, is the infallible road to\nbankruptcy. The presumptuous hope of success seems to act here as upon all\nother occasions, and to entice so many adventurers into those hazardous\ntrades, that their competition reduces the profit below what is sufficient\nto compensate the risk. To compensate it completely, the common returns\nought, over and above the ordinary profits of stock, not only to make up\nfor all occasional losses, but to afford a surplus profit to the\nadventurers, of the same nature with the profit of insurers. But if the\ncommon returns were sufficient for all this, bankruptcies would not be\nmore frequent in these than in other trades.\nOf the five circumstances, therefore, which vary the wages of labour, two\nonly affect the profits of stock; the agreeableness or disagreeableness of\nthe business, and the risk or security with which it is attended. In point\nof agreeableness or disagreeableness, there is little or no difference in\nthe far greater part of the different employments of stock, but a great\ndeal in those of labour; and the ordinary profit of stock, though it rises\nwith the risk, does not always seem to rise in proportion to it. It should\nfollow from all this, that, in the same society or neighbourhood, the\naverage and ordinary rates of profit in the different employments of stock\nshould be more nearly upon a level than the pecuniary wages of the\ndifferent sorts of labour.\nThey are so accordingly. The difference between the earnings of a common\nlabourer and those of a well employed lawyer or physician, is evidently\nmuch greater than that between the ordinary profits in any two different\nbranches of trade. The apparent difference, besides, in the profits of\ndifferent trades, is generally a deception arising from our not always\ndistinguishing what ought to be considered as wages, from what ought to be\nconsidered as profit.\nApothecaries\u2019 profit is become a bye-word, denoting something uncommonly\nextravagant. This great apparent profit, however, is frequently no more\nthan the reasonable wages of labour. The skill of an apothecary is a much\nnicer and more delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever; and\nthe trust which is reposed in him is of much greater importance. He is the\nphysician of the poor in all cases, and of the rich when the distress or\ndanger is not very great. His reward, therefore, ought to be suitable to\nhis skill and his trust; and it arises generally from the price at which\nhe sells his drugs. But the whole drugs which the best employed apothecary\nin a large market-town, will sell in a year, may not perhaps cost him\nabove thirty or forty pounds. Though he should sell them, therefore, for\nthree or four hundred, or at a thousand per cent. profit, this may\nfrequently be no more than the reasonable wages of his labour, charged, in\nthe only way in which he can charge them, upon the price of his drugs. The\ngreater part of the apparent profit is real wages disguised in the garb of\nprofit.\nIn a small sea-port town, a little grocer will make forty or fifty per\ncent. upon a stock of a single hundred pounds, while a considerable\nwholesale merchant in the same place will scarce make eight or ten per\ncent. upon a stock of ten thousand. The trade of the grocer may be\nnecessary for the conveniency of the inhabitants, and the narrowness of\nthe market may not admit the employment of a larger capital in the\nbusiness. The man, however, must not only live by his trade, but live by\nit suitably to the qualifications which it requires. Besides possessing a\nlittle capital, he must be able to read, write, and account and must be a\ntolerable judge, too, of perhaps fifty or sixty different sorts of goods,\ntheir prices, qualities, and the markets where they are to be had\ncheapest. He must have all the knowledge, in short, that is necessary for\na great merchant, which nothing hinders him from becoming but the want of\na sufficient capital. Thirty or forty pounds a year cannot be considered\nas too great a recompence for the labour of a person so accomplished.\nDeduct this from the seemingly great profits of his capital, and little\nmore will remain, perhaps, than the ordinary profits of stock. The greater\npart of the apparent profit is, in this case too, real wages.\nThe difference between the apparent profit of the retail and that of the\nwholesale trade, is much less in the capital than in small towns and\ncountry villages. Where ten thousand pounds can be employed in the grocery\ntrade, the wages of the grocer\u2019s labour must be a very trifling addition\nto the real profits of so great a stock. The apparent profits of the\nwealthy retailer, therefore, are there more nearly upon a level with those\nof the wholesale merchant. It is upon this account that goods sold by\nretail are generally as cheap, and frequently much cheaper, in the capital\nthan in small towns and country villages. Grocery goods, for example, are\ngenerally much cheaper; bread and butchers\u2019 meat frequently as cheap. It\ncosts no more to bring grocery goods to the great town than to the country\nvillage; but it costs a great deal more to bring corn and cattle, as the\ngreater part of them must be brought from a much greater distance. The\nprime cost of grocery goods, therefore, being the same in both places,\nthey are cheapest where the least profit is charged upon them. The prime\ncost of bread and butchers\u2019 meat is greater in the great town than in the\ncountry village; and though the profit is less, therefore they are not\nalways cheaper there, but often equally cheap. In such articles as bread\nand butchers\u2019 meat, the same cause which diminishes apparent profit,\nincreases prime cost. The extent of the market, by giving employment to\ngreater stocks, diminishes apparent profit; but by requiring supplies from\na greater distance, it increases prime cost. This diminution of the one\nand increase of the other, seem, in most cases, nearly to counterbalance\none another; which is probably the reason that, though the prices of corn\nand cattle are commonly very different in different parts of the kingdom,\nthose of bread and butchers\u2019 meat are generally very nearly the same\nthrough the greater part of it.\nThough the profits of stock, both in the wholesale and retail trade, are\ngenerally less in the capital than in small towns and country villages,\nyet great fortunes are frequently acquired from small beginnings in the\nformer, and scarce ever in the latter. In small towns and country\nvillages, on account of the narrowness of the market, trade cannot always\nbe extended as stock extends. In such places, therefore, though the rate\nof a particular person\u2019s profits may be very high, the sum or amount of\nthem can never be very great, nor consequently that of his annual\naccumulation. In great towns, on the contrary, trade can be extended as\nstock increases, and the credit of a frugal and thriving man increases\nmuch faster than his stock. His trade is extended in proportion to the\namount of both; and the sum or amount of his profits is in proportion to\nthe extent of his trade, and his annual accumulation in proportion to the\namount of his profits. It seldom happens, however, that great fortunes are\nmade, even in great towns, by any one regular, established, and well-known\nbranch of business, but in consequence of a long life of industry,\nfrugality, and attention. Sudden fortunes, indeed, are sometimes made in\nsuch places, by what is called the trade of speculation. The speculative\nmerchant exercises no one regular, established, or well-known branch of\nbusiness. He is a corn merchant this year, and a wine merchant the next,\nand a sugar, tobacco, or tea merchant the year after. He enters into every\ntrade, when he foresees that it is likely to be more than commonly\nprofitable, and he quits it when he foresees that its profits are likely\nto return to the level of other trades. His profits and losses, therefore,\ncan bear no regular proportion to those of any one established and\nwell-known branch of business. A bold adventurer may sometimes acquire a\nconsiderable fortune by two or three successful speculations, but is just\nas likely to lose one by two or three unsuccessful ones. This trade can be\ncarried on nowhere but in great towns. It is only in places of the most\nextensive commerce and correspondence that the intelligence requisite for\nit can be had.\nThe five circumstances above mentioned, though they occasion considerable\ninequalities in the wages of labour and profits of stock, occasion none in\nthe whole of the advantages and disadvantages, real or imaginary, of the\ndifferent employments of either. The nature of those circumstances is\nsuch, that they make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and\ncounterbalance a great one in others.\nIn order, however, that this equality may take place in the whole of their\nadvantages or disadvantages, three things are requisite, even where there\nis the most perfect freedom. First the employments must be well known and\nlong established in the neighbourhood; secondly, they must be in their\nordinary, or what may be called their natural state; and, thirdly, they\nmust be the sole or principal employments of those who occupy them.\nFirst, this equality can take place only in those employments which are\nwell known, and have been long established in the neighbourhood.\nWhere all other circumstances are equal, wages are generally higher in new\nthan in old trades. When a projector attempts to establish a new\nmanufacture, he must at first entice his workmen from other employments,\nby higher wages than they can either earn in their own trades, or than the\nnature of his work would otherwise require; and a considerable time must\npass away before he can venture to reduce them to the common level.\nManufactures for which the demand arises altogether from fashion and\nfancy, are continually changing, and seldom last long enough to be\nconsidered as old established manufactures. Those, on the contrary, for\nwhich the demand arises chiefly from use or necessity, are less liable to\nchange, and the same form or fabric may continue in demand for whole\ncenturies together. The wages of labour, therefore, are likely to be\nhigher in manufactures of the former, than in those of the latter kind.\nBirmingham deals chiefly in manufactures of the former kind; Sheffield in\nthose of the latter; and the wages of labour in those two different places\nare said to be suitable to this difference in the nature of their\nmanufactures.\nThe establishment of any new manufacture, of any new branch of commerce,\nor of any new practice in agriculture, is always a speculation from which\nthe projector promises himself extraordinary profits. These profits\nsometimes are very great, and sometimes, more frequently, perhaps, they\nare quite otherwise; but, in general, they bear no regular proportion to\nthose of other old trades in the neighbourhood. If the project succeeds,\nthey are commonly at first very high. When the trade or practice becomes\nthoroughly established and well known, the competition reduces them to the\nlevel of other trades.\nSecondly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages\nof the different employments of labour and stock, can take place only in\nthe ordinary, or what may be called the natural state of those\nemployments.\nThe demand for almost every different species of labour is sometimes\ngreater, and sometimes less than usual. In the one case, the advantages of\nthe employment rise above, in the other they fall below the common level.\nThe demand for country labour is greater at hay-time and harvest than\nduring the greater part of the year; and wages rise with the demand. In\ntime of war, when forty or fifty thousand sailors are forced from the\nmerchant service into that of the king, the demand for sailors to merchant\nships necessarily rises with their scarcity; and their wages, upon such\noccasions, commonly rise from a guinea and seven-and-twenty shillings to\nforty shillings and three pounds a-month. In a decaying manufacture, on\nthe contrary, many workmen, rather than quit their own trade, are\ncontented with smaller wages than would otherwise be suitable to the\nnature of their employment.\nThe profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which it is\nemployed. As the price of any commodity rises above the ordinary or\naverage rate, the profits of at least some part of the stock that is\nemployed in bringing it to market, rise above their proper level, and as\nit falls they sink below it. All commodities are more or less liable to\nvariations of price, but some are much more so than others. In all\ncommodities which are produced by human industry, the quantity of industry\nannually employed is necessarily regulated by the annual demand, in such a\nmanner that the average annual produce may, as nearly as possible, be\nequal to the average annual consumption. In some employments, it has\nalready been observed, the same quantity of industry will always produce\nthe same, or very nearly the same quantity of commodities. In the linen or\nwoollen manufactures, for example, the same number of hands will annually\nwork up very nearly the same quantity of linen and woollen cloth. The\nvariations in the market price of such commodities, therefore, can arise\nonly from some accidental variation in the demand. A public mourning\nraises the price of black cloth. But as the demand for most sorts of plain\nlinen and woollen cloth is pretty uniform, so is likewise the price. But\nthere are other employments in which the same quantity of industry will\nnot always produce the same quantity of commodities. The same quantity of\nindustry, for example, will, in different years, produce very different\nquantities of corn, wine, hops, sugar, tobacco, etc. The price of such\ncommodities, therefore, varies not only with the variations of demand, but\nwith the much greater and more frequent variations of quantity, and is\nconsequently extremely fluctuating; but the profit of some of the dealers\nmust necessarily fluctuate with the price of the commodities. The\noperations of the speculative merchant are principally employed about such\ncommodities. He endeavours to buy them up when he foresees that their\nprice is likely to rise, and to sell them when it is likely to fall.\nThirdly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of\nthe different employments of labour and stock, can take place only in such\nas are the sole or principal employments of those who occupy them.\nWhen a person derives his subsistence from one employment, which does not\noccupy the greater part of his time, in the intervals of his leisure he is\noften willing to work at another for less wages than would otherwise suit\nthe nature of the employment.\nThere still subsists, in many parts of Scotland, a set of people called\ncottars or cottagers, though they were more frequent some years ago than\nthey are now. They are a sort of out-servants of the landlords and\nfarmers. The usual reward which they receive from their master is a house,\na small garden for pot-herbs, as much grass as will feed a cow, and,\nperhaps, an acre or two of bad arable land. When their master has occasion\nfor their labour, he gives them, besides, two pecks of oatmeal a-week,\nworth about sixteen pence sterling. During a great part of the year, he\nhas little or no occasion for their labour, and the cultivation of their\nown little possession is not sufficient to occupy the time which is left\nat their own disposal. When such occupiers were more numerous than they\nare at present, they are said to have been willing to give their spare\ntime for a very small recompence to any body, and to have wrought for less\nwages than other labourers. In ancient times, they seem to have been\ncommon all over Europe. In countries ill cultivated, and worse inhabited,\nthe greater part of landlords and farmers could not otherwise provide\nthemselves with the extraordinary number of hands which country labour\nrequires at certain seasons. The daily or weekly recompence which such\nlabourers occasionally received from their masters, was evidently not the\nwhole price of their labour. Their small tenement made a considerable part\nof it. This daily or weekly recompence, however, seems to have been\nconsidered as the whole of it, by many writers who have collected the\nprices of labour and provisions in ancient times, and who have taken\npleasure in representing both as wonderfully low.\nThe produce of such labour comes frequently cheaper to market than would\notherwise be suitable to its nature. Stockings, in many parts of Scotland,\nare knit much cheaper than they can anywhere be wrought upon the loom.\nThey are the work of servants and labourers who derive the principal part\nof their subsistence from some other employment. More than a thousand pair\nof Shetland stockings are annually imported into Leith, of which the price\nis from fivepence to seven-pence a pair. At Lerwick, the small capital of\nthe Shetland islands, tenpence a-day, I have been assured, is a common\nprice of common labour. In the same islands, they knit worsted stockings\nto the value of a guinea a pair and upwards.\nThe spinning of linen yarn is carried on in Scotland nearly in the same\nway as the knitting of stockings, by servants, who are chiefly hired for\nother purposes. They earn but a very scanty subsistence, who endeavour to\nget their livelihood by either of those trades. In most parts of Scotland,\nshe is a good spinner who can earn twentypence a-week.\nIn opulent countries, the market is generally so extensive, that any one\ntrade is sufficient to employ the whole labour and stock of those who\noccupy it. Instances of people living by one employment, and, at the same\ntime, deriving some little advantage from another, occur chiefly in poor\ncountries. The following instance, however, of something of the same kind,\nis to be found in the capital of a very rich one. There is no city in\nEurope, I believe, in which house-rent is dearer than in London, and yet I\nknow no capital in which a furnished apartment can be hired so cheap.\nLodging is not only much cheaper in London than in Paris; it is much\ncheaper than in Edinburgh, of the same degree of goodness; and, what may\nseem extraordinary, the dearness of house-rent is the cause of the\ncheapness of lodging. The dearness of house-rent in London arises, not\nonly from those causes which render it dear in all great capitals, the\ndearness of labour, the dearness of all the materials of building, which\nmust generally be brought from a great distance, and, above all, the\ndearness of ground-rent, every landlord acting the part of a monopolist,\nand frequently exacting a higher rent for a single acre of bad land in a\ntown, than can be had for a hundred of the best in the country; but it\narises in part from the peculiar manners and customs of the people, which\noblige every master of a family to hire a whole house from top to bottom.\nA dwelling-house in England means every thing that is contained under the\nsame roof. In France, Scotland, and many other parts of Europe, it\nfrequently means no more than a single storey. A tradesman in London is\nobliged to hire a whole house in that part of the town where his customers\nlive. His shop is upon the ground floor, and he and his family sleep in\nthe garret; and he endeavours to pay a part of his house-rent by letting\nthe two middle storeys to lodgers. He expects to maintain his family by\nhis trade, and not by his lodgers. Whereas at Paris and Edinburgh, people\nwho let lodgings have commonly no other means of subsistence; and the\nprice of the lodging must pay, not only the rent of the house, but the\nwhole expense of the family.\nPART II.\u2014Inequalities occasioned by the Policy of Europe.\nSuch are the inequalities in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages\nof the different employments of labour and stock, which the defect of any\nof the three requisites above mentioned must occasion, even where there is\nthe most perfect liberty. But the policy of Europe, by not leaving things\nat perfect liberty, occasions other inequalities of much greater\nimportance.\nIt does this chiefly in the three following ways. First, by restraining\nthe competition in some employments to a smaller number than would\notherwise be disposed to enter into them; secondly, by increasing it in\nothers beyond what it naturally would be; and, thirdly, by obstructing the\nfree circulation of labour and stock, both from employment to employment,\nand from place to place.\nFirst, The policy of Europe occasions a very important inequality in the\nwhole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of\nlabour and stock, by restraining the competition in some employments to a\nsmaller number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into them.\nThe exclusive privileges of corporations are the principal means it makes\nuse of for this purpose.\nThe exclusive privilege of an incorporated trade necessarily restrains the\ncompetition, in the town where it is established, to those who are free of\nthe trade. To have served an apprenticeship in the town, under a master\nproperly qualified, is commonly the necessary requisite for obtaining this\nfreedom. The bye-laws of the corporation regulate sometimes the number of\napprentices which any master is allowed to have, and almost always the\nnumber of years which each apprentice is obliged to serve. The intention\nof both regulations is to restrain the competition to a much smaller\nnumber than might otherwise be disposed to enter into the trade. The\nlimitation of the number of apprentices restrains it directly. A long term\nof apprenticeship restrains it more indirectly, but as effectually, by\nincreasing the expense of education.\nIn Sheffield, no master cutler can have more than one apprentice at a\ntime, by a bye-law of the corporation. In Norfolk and Norwich, no master\nweaver can have more than two apprentices, under pain of forfeiting five\npounds a-month to the king. No master hatter can have more than two\napprentices anywhere in England, or in the English plantations, under pain\nof forfeiting; five pounds a-month, half to the king, and half to him who\nshall sue in any court of record. Both these regulations, though they have\nbeen confirmed by a public law of the kingdom, are evidently dictated by\nthe same corporation-spirit which enacted the bye-law of Sheffield. The\nsilk-weavers in London had scarce been incorporated a year, when they\nenacted a bye-law, restraining any master from having more than two\napprentices at a time. It required a particular act of parliament to\nrescind this bye-law.\nSeven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual term\nestablished for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of\nincorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently called\nuniversities, which, indeed, is the proper Latin name for any\nincorporation whatever. The university of smiths, the university of\ntailors, etc. are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old\ncharters of ancient towns. When those particular incorporations, which are\nnow peculiarly called universities, were first established, the term of\nyears which it was necessary to study, in order to obtain the degree of\nmaster of arts, appears evidently to have been copied from the term of\napprenticeship in common trades, of which the incorporations were much\nmore ancient. As to have wrought seven years under a master properly\nqualified, was necessary, in order to entitle any person to become a\nmaster, and to have himself apprentices in a common trade; so to have\nstudied seven years under a master properly qualified, was necessary to\nentitle him to become a master, teacher, or doctor (words anciently\nsynonymous), in the liberal arts, and to have scholars or apprentices\n(words likewise originally synonymous) to study under him.\nBy the 5th of Elizabeth, commonly called the Statute of Apprenticeship, it\nwas enacted, that no person should, for the future, exercise any trade,\ncraft, or mystery, at that time exercised in England, unless he had\npreviously served to it an apprenticeship of seven years at least; and\nwhat before had been the bye-law of many particular corporations, became\nin England the general and public law of all trades carried on in market\ntowns. For though the words of the statute are very general, and seem\nplainly to include the whole kingdom, by interpretation its operation has\nbeen limited to market towns; it having been held that, in country\nvillages, a person may exercise several different trades, though he has\nnot served a seven years apprenticeship to each, they being necessary for\nthe conveniency of the inhabitants, and the number of people frequently\nnot being sufficient to supply each with a particular set of hands. By a\nstrict interpretation of the words, too, the operation of this statute has\nbeen limited to those trades which were established in England before the\n5th of Elizabeth, and has never been extended to such as have been\nintroduced since that time. This limitation has given occasion to several\ndistinctions, which, considered as rules of police, appear as foolish as\ncan well be imagined. It has been adjudged, for example, that a\ncoach-maker can neither himself make nor employ journeymen to make his\ncoach-wheels, but must buy them of a master wheel-wright; this latter\ntrade having been exercised in England before the 5th of Elizabeth. But a\nwheel-wright, though he has never served an apprenticeship to a\ncoachmaker, may either himself make or employ journeymen to make coaches;\nthe trade of a coachmaker not being within the statute, because not\nexercised in England at the time when it was made. The manufactures of\nManchester, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, are many of them, upon this\naccount, not within the statute, not having been exercised in England\nbefore the 5th of Elizabeth.\nIn France, the duration of apprenticeships is different in different towns\nand in different trades. In Paris, five years is the term required in a\ngreat number; but, before any person can be qualified to exercise the\ntrade as a master, he must, in many of them, serve five years more as a\njourneyman. During this latter term, he is called the companion of his\nmaster, and the term itself is called his companionship.\nIn Scotland, there is no general law which regulates universally the\nduration of apprenticeships. The term is different in different\ncorporations. Where it is long, a part of it may generally be redeemed by\npaying a small fine. In most towns, too, a very small fine is sufficient\nto purchase the freedom of any corporation. The weavers of linen and\nhempen cloth, the principal manufactures of the country, as well as all\nother artificers subservient to them, wheel-makers, reel-makers, etc. may\nexercise their trades in any town-corporate without paying any fine. In\nall towns-corporate, all persons are free to sell butchers\u2019 meat upon any\nlawful day of the week. Three years is, in Scotland, a common term of\napprenticeship, even in some very nice trades; and, in general, I know of\nno country in Europe, in which corporation laws are so little oppressive.\nThe property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original\nfoundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable.\nThe patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his\nhands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in\nwhat manner he thinks proper, without injury to his neighbour, is a plain\nviolation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon\nthe just liberty, both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed\nto employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks\nproper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To\njudge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the\ndiscretion of the employers, whose interest it so much concerns. The\naffected anxiety of the lawgiver, lest they should employ an improper\nperson, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive.\nThe institution of long apprenticeships can give no security that\ninsufficient workmanship shall not frequently be exposed to public sale.\nWhen this is done, it is generally the effect of fraud, and not of\ninability; and the longest apprenticeship can give no security against\nfraud. Quite different regulations are necessary to prevent this abuse.\nThe sterling mark upon plate, and the stamps upon linen and woollen cloth,\ngive the purchaser much greater security than any statute of\napprenticeship. He generally looks at these, but never thinks it worth\nwhile to enquire whether the workman had served a seven years\napprenticeship.\nThe institution of long apprenticeships has no tendency to form young\npeople to industry. A journeyman who works by the piece is likely to be\nindustrious, because he derives a benefit from every exertion of his\nindustry. An apprentice is likely to be idle, and almost always is so,\nbecause he has no immediate interest to be otherwise. In the inferior\nemployments, the sweets of labour consist altogether in the recompence of\nlabour. They who are soonest in a condition to enjoy the sweets of it, are\nlikely soonest to conceive a relish for it, and to acquire the early habit\nof industry. A young man naturally conceives an aversion to labour, when\nfor a long time he receives no benefit from it. The boys who are put out\napprentices from public charities are generally bound for more than the\nusual number of years, and they generally turn out very idle and\nworthless.\nApprenticeships were altogether unknown to the ancients. The reciprocal\nduties of master and apprentice make a considerable article in every\nmodern code. The Roman law is perfectly silent with regard to them. I know\nno Greek or Latin word (I might venture, I believe, to assert that there\nis none) which expresses the idea we now annex to the word apprentice, a\nservant bound to work at a particular trade for the benefit of a master,\nduring a term of years, upon condition that the master shall teach him\nthat trade.\nLong apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary. The arts, which are much\nsuperior to common trades, such as those of making clocks and watches,\ncontain no such mystery as to require a long course of instruction. The\nfirst invention of such beautiful machines, indeed, and even that of some\nof the instruments employed in making them, must no doubt have been the\nwork of deep thought and long time, and may justly be considered as among\nthe happiest efforts of human ingenuity. But when both have been fairly\ninvented, and are well understood, to explain to any young man, in the\ncompletest manner, how to apply the instruments, and how to construct the\nmachines, cannot well require more than the lessons of a few weeks;\nperhaps those of a few days might be sufficient. In the common mechanic\ntrades, those of a few days might certainly be sufficient. The dexterity\nof hand, indeed, even in common trades, cannot be acquired without much\npractice and experience. But a young man would practice with much more\ndiligence and attention, if from the beginning he wrought as a journeyman,\nbeing paid in proportion to the little work which he could execute, and\npaying in his turn for the materials which he might sometimes spoil\nthrough awkwardness and inexperience. His education would generally in\nthis way be more effectual, and always less tedious and expensive. The\nmaster, indeed, would be a loser. He would lose all the wages of the\napprentice, which he now saves, for seven years together. In the end,\nperhaps, the apprentice himself would be a loser. In a trade so easily\nlearnt he would have more competitors, and his wages, when he came to be a\ncomplete workman, would be much less than at present. The same increase of\ncompetition would reduce the profits of the masters, as well as the wages\nof workmen. The trades, the crafts, the mysteries, would all be losers.\nBut the public would be a gainer, the work of all artificers coming in\nthis way much cheaper to market.\nIt is to prevent this reduction of price, and consequently of wages and\nprofit, by restraining that free competition which would most certainly\noccasion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of corporation\nlaws have been established. In order to erect a corporation, no other\nauthority in ancient times was requisite, in many parts of Europe, but\nthat of the town-corporate in which it was established. In England,\nindeed, a charter from the king was likewise necessary. But this\nprerogative of the crown seems to have been reserved rather for extorting\nmoney from the subject, than for the defence of the common liberty against\nsuch oppressive monopolies. Upon paying a fine to the king, the charter\nseems generally to have been readily granted; and when any particular\nclass of artificers or traders thought proper to act as a corporation,\nwithout a charter, such adulterine guilds, as they were called, were not\nalways disfranchised upon that account, but obliged to fine annually to\nthe king, for permission to exercise their usurped privileges {See Madox\nFirma Burgi p. 26 etc.}. The immediate inspection of all corporations, and\nof the bye-laws which they might think proper to enact for their own\ngovernment, belonged to the town-corporate in which they were established;\nand whatever discipline was exercised over them, proceeded commonly, not\nfrom the king, but from that greater incorporation of which those\nsubordinate ones were only parts or members.\nThe government of towns-corporate was altogether in the hands of traders\nand artificers, and it was the manifest interest of every particular class\nof them, to prevent the market from being overstocked, as they commonly\nexpress it, with their own particular species of industry; which is in\nreality to keep it always understocked. Each class was eager to establish\nregulations proper for this purpose, and, provided it was allowed to do\nso, was willing to consent that every other class should do the same. In\nconsequence of such regulations, indeed, each class was obliged to buy the\ngoods they had occasion for from every other within the town, somewhat\ndearer than they otherwise might have done. But, in recompence, they were\nenabled to sell their own just as much dearer; so that, so far it was as\nbroad as long, as they say; and in the dealings of the different classes\nwithin the town with one another, none of them were losers by these\nregulations. But in their dealings with the country they were all great\ngainers; and in these latter dealings consist the whole trade which\nsupports and enriches every town.\nEvery town draws its whole subsistence, and all the materials of its\nindustry, from the country. It pays for these chiefly in two ways. First,\nby sending back to the country a part of those materials wrought up and\nmanufactured; in which case, their price is augmented by the wages of the\nworkmen, and the profits of their masters or immediate employers;\nsecondly, by sending to it a part both of the rude and manufactured\nproduce, either of other countries, or of distant parts of the same\ncountry, imported into the town; in which case, too, the original price of\nthose goods is augmented by the wages of the carriers or sailors, and by\nthe profits of the merchants who employ them. In what is gained upon the\nfirst of those branches of commerce, consists the advantage which the town\nmakes by its manufactures; in what is gained upon the second, the\nadvantage of its inland and foreign trade. The wages of the workmen, and\nthe profits of their different employers, make up the whole of what is\ngained upon both. Whatever regulations, therefore, tend to increase those\nwages and profits beyond what they otherwise: would be, tend to enable the\ntown to purchase, with a smaller quantity of its labour, the produce of a\ngreater quantity of the labour of the country. They give the traders and\nartificers in the town an advantage over the landlords, farmers, and\nlabourers, in the country, and break down that natural equality which\nwould otherwise take place in the commerce which is carried on between\nthem. The whole annual produce of the labour of the society is annually\ndivided between those two different sets of people. By means of those\nregulations, a greater share of it is given to the inhabitants of the town\nthan would otherwise fall to them, and a less to those of the country.\nThe price which the town really pays for the provisions and materials\nannually imported into it, is the quantity of manufactures and other goods\nannually exported from it. The dearer the latter are sold, the cheaper the\nformer are bought. The industry of the town becomes more, and that of the\ncountry less advantageous.\nThat the industry which is carried on in towns is, everywhere in Europe,\nmore advantageous than that which is carried on in the country, without\nentering into any very nice computations, we may satisfy ourselves by one\nvery simple and obvious observation. In every country of Europe, we find\nat least a hundred people who have acquired great fortunes, from small\nbeginnings, by trade and manufactures, the industry which properly belongs\nto towns, for one who has done so by that which properly belongs to the\ncountry, the raising of rude produce by the improvement and cultivation of\nland. Industry, therefore, must be better rewarded, the wages of labour\nand the profits of stock must evidently be greater, in the one situation\nthan in the other. But stock and labour naturally seek the most\nadvantageous employment. They naturally, therefore, resort as much as they\ncan to the town, and desert the country.\nThe inhabitants of a town being collected into one place, can easily\ncombine together. The most insignificant trades carried on in towns have,\naccordingly, in some place or other, been incorporated; and even where\nthey have never been incorporated, yet the corporation-spirit, the\njealousy of strangers, the aversion to take apprentices, or to communicate\nthe secret of their trade, generally prevail in them, and often teach\nthem, by voluntary associations and agreements, to prevent that free\ncompetition which they cannot prohibit by bye-laws. The trades which\nemploy but a small number of hands, run most easily into such\ncombinations. Half-a-dozen wool-combers, perhaps, are necessary to keep a\nthousand spinners and weavers at work. By combining not to take\napprentices, they can not only engross the employment, but reduce the\nwhole manufacture into a sort of slavery to themselves, and raise the\nprice of their labour much above what is due to the nature of their work.\nThe inhabitants of the country, dispersed in distant places, cannot easily\ncombine together. They have not only never been incorporated, but the\nincorporation spirit never has prevailed among them. No apprenticeship has\never been thought necessary to qualify for husbandry, the great trade of\nthe country. After what are called the fine arts, and the liberal\nprofessions, however, there is perhaps no trade which requires so great a\nvariety of knowledge and experience. The innumerable volumes which have\nbeen written upon it in all languages, may satisfy us, that among the\nwisest and most learned nations, it has never been regarded as a matter\nvery easily understood. And from all those volumes we shall in vain\nattempt to collect that knowledge of its various and complicated\noperations which is commonly possessed even by the common farmer; how\ncontemptuously soever the very contemptible authors of some of them may\nsometimes affect to speak of him. There is scarce any common mechanic\ntrade, on the contrary, of which all the operations may not be as\ncompletely and distinctly explained in a pamphlet of a very few pages, as\nit is possible for words illustrated by figures to explain them. In the\nhistory of the arts, now publishing by the French Academy of Sciences,\nseveral of them are actually explained in this manner. The direction of\noperations, besides, which must be varied with every change of the\nweather, as well as with many other accidents, requires much more judgment\nand discretion, than that of those which are always the same, or very\nnearly the same.\nNot only the art of the farmer, the general direction of the operations of\nhusbandry, but many inferior branches of country labour require much more\nskill and experience than the greater part of mechanic trades. The man who\nworks upon brass and iron, works with instruments, and upon materials of\nwhich the temper is always the same, or very nearly the same. But the man\nwho ploughs the ground with a team of horses or oxen, works with\ninstruments of which the health, strength, and temper, are very different\nupon different occasions. The condition of the materials which he works\nupon, too, is as variable as that of the instruments which he works with,\nand both require to be managed with much judgment and discretion. The\ncommon ploughman, though generally regarded as the pattern of stupidity\nand ignorance, is seldom defective in this judgment and discretion. He is\nless accustomed, indeed, to social intercourse, than the mechanic who\nlives in a town. His voice and language are more uncouth, and more\ndifficult to be understood by those who are not used to them. His\nunderstanding, however, being accustomed to consider a greater variety of\nobjects, is generally much superior to that of the other, whose whole\nattention, from morning till night, is commonly occupied in performing one\nor two very simple operations. How much the lower ranks of people in the\ncountry are really superior to those of the town, is well known to every\nman whom either business or curiosity has led to converse much with both.\nIn China and Indostan, accordingly, both the rank and the wages of country\nlabourers are said to be superior to those of the greater part of\nartificers and manufacturers. They would probably be so everywhere, if\ncorporation laws and the corporation spirit did not prevent it.\nThe superiority which the industry of the towns has everywhere in Europe\nover that of the country, is not altogether owing to corporations and\ncorporation laws. It is supported by many other regulations. The high\nduties upon foreign manufactures, and upon all goods imported by alien\nmerchants, all tend to the same purpose. Corporation laws enable the\ninhabitants of towns to raise their prices, without fearing to be\nundersold by the free competition of their own countrymen. Those other\nregulations secure them equally against that of foreigners. The\nenhancement of price occasioned by both is everywhere finally paid by the\nlandlords, farmers, and labourers, of the country, who have seldom opposed\nthe establishment of such monopolies. They have commonly neither\ninclination nor fitness to enter into combinations; and the clamour and\nsophistry of merchants and manufacturers easily persuade them, that the\nprivate interest of a part, and of a subordinate part, of the society, is\nthe general interest of the whole.\nIn Great Britain, the superiority of the industry of the towns over that\nof the country seems to have been greater formerly than in the present\ntimes. The wages of country labour approach nearer to those of\nmanufacturing labour, and the profits of stock employed in agriculture to\nthose of trading and manufacturing stock, than they are said to have done\nin the last century, or in the beginning of the present. This change may\nbe regarded as the necessary, though very late consequence of the\nextraordinary encouragement given to the industry of the towns. The stocks\naccumulated in them come in time to be so great, that it can no longer be\nemployed with the ancient profit in that species of industry which is\npeculiar to them. That industry has its limits like every other; and the\nincrease of stock, by increasing the competition, necessarily reduces the\nprofit. The lowering of profit in the town forces out stock to the\ncountry, where, by creating a new demand for country labour, it\nnecessarily raises its wages. It then spreads itself, if I my say so, over\nthe face of the land, and, by being employed in agriculture, is in part\nrestored to the country, at the expense of which, in a great measure, it\nhad originally been accumulated in the town. That everywhere in Europe the\ngreatest improvements of the country have been owing to such over flowings\nof the stock originally accumulated in the towns, I shall endeavour to\nshew hereafter, and at the same time to demonstrate, that though some\ncountries have, by this course, attained to a considerable degree of\nopulence, it is in itself necessarily slow, uncertain, liable to be\ndisturbed and interrupted by innumerable accidents, and, in every respect,\ncontrary to the order of nature and of reason. The interests, prejudices,\nlaws, and customs, which have given occasion to it, I shall endeavour to\nexplain as fully and distinctly as I can in the third and fourth books of\nthis Inquiry.\nPeople of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and\ndiversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public,\nor in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible, indeed, to\nprevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would\nbe consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder\npeople of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to\ndo nothing to facilitate such assemblies, much less to render them\nnecessary.\nA regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular\ntown to enter their names and places of abode in a public register,\nfacilitates such assemblies. It connects individuals who might never\notherwise be known to one another, and gives every man of the trade a\ndirection where to find every other man of it.\nA regulation which enables those of the same trade to tax themselves, in\norder to provide for their poor, their sick, their widows and orphans, by\ngiving them a common interest to manage, renders such assemblies\nnecessary.\nAn incorporation not only renders them necessary, but makes the act of the\nmajority binding upon the whole. In a free trade, an effectual combination\ncannot be established but by the unanimous consent of every single trader,\nand it cannot last longer than every single trader continues of the same\nmind. The majority of a corporation can enact a bye-law, with proper\npenalties, which will limit the competition more effectually and more\ndurably than any voluntary combination whatever.\nThe pretence that corporations are necessary for the better government of\nthe trade, is without any foundation. The real and effectual discipline\nwhich is exercised over a workman, is not that of his corporation, but\nthat of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which\nrestrains his frauds and corrects his negligence. An exclusive corporation\nnecessarily weakens the force of this discipline. A particular set of\nworkmen must then be employed, let them behave well or ill. It is upon\nthis account that, in many large incorporated towns, no tolerable workmen\nare to be found, even in some of the most necessary trades. If you would\nhave your work tolerably executed, it must be done in the suburbs, where\nthe workmen, having no exclusive privilege, have nothing but their\ncharacter to depend upon, and you must then smuggle it into the town as\nwell as you can.\nIt is in this manner that the policy of Europe, by restraining the\ncompetition in some employments to a smaller number than would otherwise\nbe disposed to enter into them, occasions a very important inequality in\nthe whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments\nof labour and stock.\nSecondly, the policy of Europe, by increasing the competition in some\nemployments beyond what it naturally would be, occasions another\ninequality, of an opposite kind, in the whole of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of the different employments of labour and stock.\nIt has been considered as of so much importance that a proper number of\nyoung people should be educated for certain professions, that sometimes\nthe public, and sometimes the piety of private founders, have established\nmany pensions, scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries, etc. for this\npurpose, which draw many more people into those trades than could\notherwise pretend to follow them. In all Christian countries, I believe,\nthe education of the greater part of churchmen is paid for in this\nmanner. Very few of them are educated altogether at their own expense.\nThe long, tedious, and expensive education, therefore, of those who are,\nwill not always procure them a suitable reward, the church being crowded\nwith people, who, in order to get employment, are willing to accept of a\nmuch smaller recompence than what such an education would otherwise have\nentitled them to; and in this manner the competition of the poor takes\naway the reward of the rich. It would be indecent, no doubt, to compare\neither a curate or a chaplain with a journeyman in any common trade. The\npay of a curate or chaplain, however, may very properly be considered as\nof the same nature with the wages of a journeyman. They are all three\npaid for their work according to the contract which they may happen to\nmake with their respective superiors. Till after the middle of the\nfourteenth century, five merks, containing about as much silver as ten\npounds of our present money, was in England the usual pay of a curate or\na stipendiary parish priest, as we find it regulated by the decrees of\nseveral different national councils. At the same period, fourpence a-day,\ncontaining the same quantity of silver as a shilling of our present\nmoney, was declared to be the pay of a master mason; and threepence\na-day, equal to ninepence of our present money, that of a journeyman\nmason. {See the Statute of Labourers, 25, Ed. III.} The wages of both\nthese labourers, therefore, supposing them to have been constantly\nemployed, were much superior to those of the curate. The wages of the\nmaster mason, supposing him to have been without employment one-third of\nthe year, would have fully equalled them. By the 12th of Queen Anne, c.\n12. it is declared, \u201cThat whereas, for want of sufficient\nmaintenance and encouragement to curates, the cures have, in several\nplaces, been meanly supplied, the bishop is, therefore, empowered to\nappoint, by writing under his hand and seal, a sufficient certain stipend\nor allowance, not exceeding fifty, and not less than twenty pounds\na-year\u201d. Forty pounds a-year is reckoned at present very good pay\nfor a curate; and, notwithstanding this act of parliament, there are many\ncuracies under twenty pounds a-year. There are journeymen shoemakers in\nLondon who earn forty pounds a-year, and there is scarce an industrious\nworkman of any kind in that metropolis who does not earn more than\ntwenty. This last sum, indeed, does not exceed what is frequently earned\nby common labourers in many country parishes. Whenever the law has\nattempted to regulate the wages of workmen, it has always been rather to\nlower them than to raise them. But the law has, upon many occasions,\nattempted to raise the wages of curates, and, for the dignity of the\nchurch, to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the\nwretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of.\nAnd, in both cases, the law seems to have been equally ineffectual, and\nhas never either been able to raise the wages of curates, or to sink\nthose of labourers to the degree that was intended; because it has never\nbeen able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less\nthan the legal allowance, on account of the indigence of their situation\nand the multitude of their competitors, or the other from receiving more,\non account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive\neither profit or pleasure from employing them.\nThe great benefices and other ecclesiastical dignities support the honour\nof the church, notwithstanding the mean circumstances of some of its\ninferior members. The respect paid to the profession, too, makes some\ncompensation even to them for the meanness of their pecuniary recompence.\nIn England, and in all Roman catholic countries, the lottery of the church\nis in reality much more advantageous than is necessary. The example of the\nchurches of Scotland, of Geneva, and of several other protestant churches,\nmay satisfy us, that in so creditable a profession, in which education is\nso easily procured, the hopes of much more moderate benefices will draw a\nsufficient number of learned, decent, and respectable men into holy\norders.\nIn professions in which there are no benefices, such as law and physic, if\nan equal proportion of people were educated at the public expense, the\ncompetition would soon be so great as to sink very much their pecuniary\nreward. It might then not be worth any man\u2019s while to educate his son to\neither of those professions at his own expense. They would be entirely\nabandoned to such as had been educated by those public charities, whose\nnumbers and necessities would oblige them in general to content themselves\nwith a very miserable recompence, to the entire degradation of the now\nrespectable professions of law and physic.\nThat unprosperous race of men, commonly called men of letters, are pretty\nmuch in the situation which lawyers and physicians probably would be in,\nupon the foregoing supposition. In every part of Europe, the greater part\nof them have been educated for the church, but have been hindered by\ndifferent reasons from entering into holy orders. They have generally,\ntherefore, been educated at the public expense; and their numbers are\neverywhere so great, as commonly to reduce the price of their labour to a\nvery paltry recompence.\nBefore the invention of the art of printing, the only employment by which\na man of letters could make any thing by his talents, was that of a public\nor private teacher, or by communicating to other people the curious and\nuseful knowledge which he had acquired himself; and this is still surely a\nmore honourable, a more useful, and, in general, even a more profitable\nemployment than that other of writing for a bookseller, to which the art\nof printing has given occasion. The time and study, the genius, knowledge,\nand application requisite to qualify an eminent teacher of the sciences,\nare at least equal to what is necessary for the greatest practitioners in\nlaw and physic. But the usual reward of the eminent teacher bears no\nproportion to that of the lawyer or physician, because the trade of the\none is crowded with indigent people, who have been brought up to it at the\npublic expense; whereas those of the other two are encumbered with very\nfew who have not been educated at their own. The usual recompence,\nhowever, of public and private teachers, small as it may appear, would\nundoubtedly be less than it is, if the competition of those yet more\nindigent men of letters, who write for bread, was not taken out of the\nmarket. Before the invention of the art of printing, a scholar and a\nbeggar seem to have been terms very nearly synonymous. The different\ngovernors of the universities, before that time, appear to have often\ngranted licences to their scholars to beg.\nIn ancient times, before any charities of this kind had been established\nfor the education of indigent people to the learned professions, the\nrewards of eminent teachers appear to have been much more considerable.\nIsocrates, in what is called his discourse against the sophists,\nreproaches the teachers of his own times with inconsistency. \u201cThey make\nthe most magnificent promises to their scholars,\u201d says he, \u201cand undertake\nto teach them to be wise, to be happy, and to be just; and, in return for\nso important a service, they stipulate the paltry reward of four or five\nminae.\u201d \u201cThey who teach wisdom,\u201d continues he, \u201cought certainly to be wise\nthemselves; but if any man were to sell such a bargain for such a price,\nhe would be convicted of the most evident folly.\u201d He certainly does not\nmean here to exaggerate the reward, and we may be assured that it was not\nless than he represents it. Four minae were equal to thirteen pounds six\nshillings and eightpence; five minae to sixteen pounds thirteen shillings\nand fourpence. Something not less than the largest of those two sums,\ntherefore, must at that time have been usually paid to the most eminent\nteachers at Athens. Isocrates himself demanded ten minae, or \u00a3 33:6:8 from\neach scholar. When he taught at Athens, he is said to have had a hundred\nscholars. I understand this to be the number whom he taught at one time,\nor who attended what we would call one course of lectures; a number which\nwill not appear extraordinary from so great a city to so famous a teacher,\nwho taught, too, what was at that time the most fashionable of all\nsciences, rhetoric. He must have made, therefore, by each course of\nlectures, a thousand minae, or \u00a3 3335:6:8. A thousand minae, accordingly,\nis said by Plutarch, in another place, to have been his didactron, or\nusual price of teaching. Many other eminent teachers in those times appear\nto have acquired great fortunes. Georgias made a present to the temple of\nDelphi of his own statue in solid gold. We must not, I presume, suppose\nthat it was as large as the life. His way of living, as well as that of\nHippias and Protagoras, two other eminent teachers of those times, is\nrepresented by Plato as splendid, even to ostentation. Plato himself is\nsaid to have lived with a good deal of magnificence. Aristotle, after\nhaving been tutor to Alexander, and most munificently rewarded, as it is\nuniversally agreed, both by him and his father, Philip, thought it worth\nwhile, notwithstanding, to return to Athens, in order to resume the\nteaching of his school. Teachers of the sciences were probably in those\ntimes less common than they came to be in an age or two afterwards, when\nthe competition had probably somewhat reduced both the price of their\nlabour and the admiration for their persons. The most eminent of them,\nhowever, appear always to have enjoyed a degree of consideration much\nsuperior to any of the like profession in the present times. The Athenians\nsent Carneades the academic, and Diogenes the stoic, upon a solemn embassy\nto Rome; and though their city had then declined from its former grandeur,\nit was still an independent and considerable republic.\nCarneades, too, was a Babylonian by birth; and as there never was a people\nmore jealous of admitting foreigners to public offices than the Athenians,\ntheir consideration for him must have been very great.\nThis inequality is, upon the whole, perhaps rather advantageous than\nhurtful to the public. It may somewhat degrade the profession of a public\nteacher; but the cheapness of literary education is surely an advantage\nwhich greatly overbalances this trifling inconveniency. The public, too,\nmight derive still greater benefit from it, if the constitution of those\nschools and colleges, in which education is carried on, was more\nreasonable than it is at present through the greater part of Europe.\nThirdly, the policy of Europe, by obstructing the free circulation of\nlabour and stock, both from employment to employment, and from place to\nplace, occasions, in some cases, a very inconvenient inequality in the\nwhole of the advantages and disadvantages of their different employments.\nThe statute of apprenticeship obstructs the free circulation of labour\nfrom one employment to another, even in the same place. The exclusive\nprivileges of corporations obstruct it from one place to another, even in\nthe same employment.\nIt frequently happens, that while high wages are given to the workmen in\none manufacture, those in another are obliged to content themselves with\nbare subsistence. The one is in an advancing state, and has therefore a\ncontinual demand for new hands; the other is in a declining state, and the\nsuperabundance of hands is continually increasing. Those two manufactures\nmay sometimes be in the same town, and sometimes in the same\nneighbourhood, without being able to lend the least assistance to one\nanother. The statute of apprenticeship may oppose it in the one case, and\nboth that and an exclusive corporation in the other. In many different\nmanufactures, however, the operations are so much alike, that the workmen\ncould easily change trades with one another, if those absurd laws did not\nhinder them. The arts of weaving plain linen and plain silk, for example,\nare almost entirely the same. That of weaving plain woollen is somewhat\ndifferent; but the difference is so insignificant, that either a linen or\na silk weaver might become a tolerable workman in a very few days. If any\nof those three capital manufactures, therefore, were decaying, the workmen\nmight find a resource in one of the other two which was in a more\nprosperous condition; and their wages would neither rise too high in the\nthriving, nor sink too low in the decaying manufacture. The linen\nmanufacture, indeed, is in England, by a particular statute, open to every\nbody; but as it is not much cultivated through the greater part of the\ncountry, it can afford no general resource to the work men of other\ndecaying manufactures, who, wherever the statute of apprenticeship takes\nplace, have no other choice, but either to come upon the parish, or to\nwork as common labourers; for which, by their habits, they are much worse\nqualified than for any sort of manufacture that bears any resemblance to\ntheir own. They generally, therefore, chuse to come upon the parish.\nWhatever obstructs the free circulation of labour from one employment to\nanother, obstructs that of stock likewise; the quantity of stock which can\nbe employed in any branch of business depending very much upon that of the\nlabour which can be employed in it. Corporation laws, however, give less\nobstruction to the free circulation of stock from one place to another,\nthan to that of labour. It is everywhere much easier for a wealthy\nmerchant to obtain the privilege of trading in a town-corporate, than for\na poor artificer to obtain that of working in it.\nThe obstruction which corporation laws give to the free circulation of\nlabour is common, I believe, to every part of Europe. That which is given\nto it by the poor laws is, so far as I know, peculiar to England. It\nconsists in the difficulty which a poor man finds in obtaining a\nsettlement, or even in being allowed to exercise his industry in any\nparish but that to which he belongs. It is the labour of artificers and\nmanufacturers only of which the free circulation is obstructed by\ncorporation laws. The difficulty of obtaining settlements obstructs even\nthat of common labour. It may be worth while to give some account of the\nrise, progress, and present state of this disorder, the greatest, perhaps,\nof any in the police of England.\nWhen, by the destruction of monasteries, the poor had been deprived of the\ncharity of those religious houses, after some other ineffectual attempts\nfor their relief, it was enacted, by the 43d of Elizabeth, c. 2. that\nevery parish should be bound to provide for its own poor, and that\noverseers of the poor should be annually appointed, who, with the\nchurch-wardens, should raise, by a parish rate, competent sums for this\npurpose.\nBy this statute, the necessity of providing for their own poor was\nindispensably imposed upon every parish. Who were to be considered as the\npoor of each parish became, therefore, a question of some importance. This\nquestion, after some variation, was at last determined by the 13th and\n14th of Charles II. when it was enacted, that forty days undisturbed\nresidence should gain any person a settlement in any parish; but that\nwithin that time it should be lawful for two justices of the peace, upon\ncomplaint made by the church-wardens or overseers of the poor, to remove\nany new inhabitant to the parish where he was last legally settled; unless\nhe either rented a tenement of ten pounds a-year, or could give such\nsecurity for the discharge of the parish where he was then living, as\nthose justices should judge sufficient.\nSome frauds, it is said, were committed in consequence of this statute;\nparish officers sometimes bribing their own poor to go clandestinely to\nanother parish, and, by keeping themselves concealed for forty days, to\ngain a settlement there, to the discharge of that to which they properly\nbelonged. It was enacted, therefore, by the 1st of James II. that the\nforty days undisturbed residence of any person necessary to gain a\nsettlement, should be accounted only from the time of his delivering\nnotice, in writing, of the place of his abode and the number of his\nfamily, to one of the church-wardens or overseers of the parish where he\ncame to dwell.\nBut parish officers, it seems, were not always more honest with regard to\ntheir own than they had been with regard to other parishes, and sometimes\nconnived at such intrusions, receiving the notice, and taking no proper\nsteps in consequence of it. As every person in a parish, therefore, was\nsupposed to have an interest to prevent as much as possible their being\nburdened by such intruders, it was further enacted by the 3rd of William\nIII. that the forty days residence should be accounted only from the\npublication of such notice in writing on Sunday in the church, immediately\nafter divine service.\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d says Doctor Burn, \u201cthis kind of settlement, by continuing\nforty days after publication of notice in writing, is very seldom\nobtained; and the design of the acts is not so much for gaining of\nsettlements, as for the avoiding of them by persons coming into a parish\nclandestinely, for the giving of notice is only putting a force upon the\nparish to remove. But if a person\u2019s situation is such, that it is doubtful\nwhether he is actually removable or not, he shall, by giving of notice,\ncompel the parish either to allow him a settlement uncontested, by\nsuffering him to continue forty days, or by removing him to try the\nright.\u201d\nThis statute, therefore, rendered it almost impracticable for a poor man\nto gain a new settlement in the old way, by forty days inhabitancy. But\nthat it might not appear to preclude altogether the common people of one\nparish from ever establishing themselves with security in another, it\nappointed four other ways by which a settlement might be gained without\nany notice delivered or published. The first was, by being taxed to parish\nrates and paying them; the second, by being elected into an annual parish\noffice, and serving in it a year; the third, by serving an apprenticeship\nin the parish; the fourth, by being hired into service there for a year,\nand continuing in the same service during the whole of it. Nobody can gain\na settlement by either of the two first ways, but by the public deed of\nthe whole parish, who are too well aware of the consequences to adopt any\nnew-comer, who has nothing but his labour to support him, either by taxing\nhim to parish rates, or by electing him into a parish office.\nNo married man can well gain any settlement in either of the two last\nways. An apprentice is scarce ever married; and it is expressly enacted,\nthat no married servant shall gain any settlement by being hired for a\nyear. The principal effect of introducing settlement by service, has been\nto put out in a great measure the old fashion of hiring for a year; which\nbefore had been so customary in England, that even at this day, if no\nparticular term is agreed upon, the law intends that every servant is\nhired for a year. But masters are not always willing to give their\nservants a settlement by hiring them in this manner; and servants are not\nalways willing to be so hired, because, as every last settlement\ndischarges all the foregoing, they might thereby lose their original\nsettlement in the places of their nativity, the habitation of their\nparents and relations.\nNo independent workman, it is evident, whether labourer or artificer, is\nlikely to gain any new settlement, either by apprenticeship or by service.\nWhen such a person, therefore, carried his industry to a new parish, he\nwas liable to be removed, how healthy and industrious soever, at the\ncaprice of any churchwarden or overseer, unless he either rented a\ntenement of ten pounds a-year, a thing impossible for one who has nothing\nbut his labour to live by, or could give such security for the discharge\nof the parish as two justices of the peace should judge sufficient.\nWhat security they shall require, indeed, is left altogether to their\ndiscretion; but they cannot well require less than thirty pounds, it\nhaving been enacted, that the purchase even of a freehold estate of less\nthan thirty pounds value, shall not gain any person a settlement, as not\nbeing sufficient for the discharge of the parish. But this is a security\nwhich scarce any man who lives by labour can give; and much greater\nsecurity is frequently demanded.\nIn order to restore, in some measure, that free circulation of labour\nwhich those different statutes had almost entirely taken away, the\ninvention of certificates was fallen upon. By the 8th and 9th of William\nIII. it was enacted that if any person should bring a certificate from the\nparish where he was last legally settled, subscribed by the church-wardens\nand overseers of the poor, and allowed by two justices of the peace, that\nevery other parish should be obliged to receive him; that he should not be\nremovable merely upon account of his being likely to become chargeable,\nbut only upon his becoming actually chargeable; and that then the parish\nwhich granted the certificate should be obliged to pay the expense both of\nhis maintenance and of his removal. And in order to give the most perfect\nsecurity to the parish where such certificated man should come to reside,\nit was further enacted by the same statute, that he should gain no\nsettlement there by any means whatever, except either by renting a\ntenement of ten pounds a-year, or by serving upon his own account in an\nannual parish office for one whole year; and consequently neither by\nnotice nor by service, nor by apprenticeship, nor by paying parish rates.\nBy the 12th of Queen Anne, too, stat. 1, c.18, it was further enacted,\nthat neither the servants nor apprentices of such certificated man should\ngain any settlement in the parish where he resided under such certificate.\nHow far this invention has restored that free circulation of labour, which\nthe preceding statutes had almost entirely taken away, we may learn from\nthe following very judicious observation of Doctor Burn. \u201cIt is obvious,\u201d\nsays he, \u201cthat there are divers good reasons for requiring certificates\nwith persons coming to settle in any place; namely, that persons residing\nunder them can gain no settlement, neither by apprenticeship, nor by\nservice, nor by giving notice, nor by paying parish rates; that they can\nsettle neither apprentices nor servants; that if they become chargeable,\nit is certainly known whither to remove them, and the parish shall be paid\nfor the removal, and for their maintenance in the mean time; and that, if\nthey fall sick, and cannot be removed, the parish which gave the\ncertificate must maintain them; none of all which can be without a\ncertificate. Which reasons will hold proportionably for parishes not\ngranting certificates in ordinary cases; for it is far more than an equal\nchance, but that they will have the certificated persons again, and in a\nworse condition.\u201d The moral of this observation seems to be, that\ncertificates ought always to be required by the parish where any poor man\ncomes to reside, and that they ought very seldom to be granted by that\nwhich he purposes to leave. \u201cThere is somewhat of hardship in this matter\nof certificates,\u201d says the same very intelligent author, in his History of\nthe Poor Laws, \u201cby putting it in the power of a parish officer to imprison\na man as it were for life, however inconvenient it may be for him to\ncontinue at that place where he has had the misfortune to acquire what is\ncalled a settlement, or whatever advantage he may propose himself by\nliving elsewhere.\u201d\nThough a certificate carries along with it no testimonial of good\nbehaviour, and certifies nothing but that the person belongs to the parish\nto which he really does belong, it is altogether discretionary in the\nparish officers either to grant or to refuse it. A mandamus was once moved\nfor, says Doctor Burn, to compel the church-wardens and overseers to sign\na certificate; but the Court of King\u2019s Bench rejected the motion as a very\nstrange attempt.\nThe very unequal price of labour which we frequently find in England, in\nplaces at no great distance from one another, is probably owing to the\nobstruction which the law of settlements gives to a poor man who would\ncarry his industry from one parish to another without a certificate. A\nsingle man, indeed who is healthy and industrious, may sometimes reside by\nsufferance without one; but a man with a wife and family who should\nattempt to do so, would, in most parishes, be sure of being removed; and,\nif the single man should afterwards marry, he would generally be removed\nlikewise. The scarcity of hands in one parish, therefore, cannot always be\nrelieved by their superabundance in another, as it is constantly in\nScotland, and I believe, in all other countries where there is no\ndifficulty of settlement. In such countries, though wages may sometimes\nrise a little in the neighbourhood of a great town, or wherever else there\nis an extraordinary demand for labour, and sink gradually as the distance\nfrom such places increases, till they fall back to the common rate of the\ncountry; yet we never meet with those sudden and unaccountable differences\nin the wages of neighbouring places which we sometimes find in England,\nwhere it is often more difficult for a poor man to pass the artificial\nboundary of a parish, than an arm of the sea, or a ridge of high\nmountains, natural boundaries which sometimes separate very distinctly\ndifferent rates of wages in other countries.\nTo remove a man who has committed no misdemeanour, from the parish where\nhe chooses to reside, is an evident violation of natural liberty and\njustice. The common people of England, however, so jealous of their\nliberty, but like the common people of most other countries, never rightly\nunderstanding wherein it consists, have now, for more than a century\ntogether, suffered themselves to be exposed to this oppression without a\nremedy. Though men of reflection, too, have sometimes complained of the\nlaw of settlements as a public grievance; yet it has never been the object\nof any general popular clamour, such as that against general warrants, an\nabusive practice undoubtedly, but such a one as was not likely to occasion\nany general oppression. There is scarce a poor man in England, of forty\nyears of age, I will venture to say, who has not, in some part of his\nlife, felt himself most cruelly oppressed by this ill-contrived law of\nsettlements.\nI shall conclude this long chapter with observing, that though anciently\nit was usual to rate wages, first by general laws extending over the whole\nkingdom, and afterwards by particular orders of the justices of peace in\nevery particular county, both these practices have now gone entirely into\ndisuse. \u201cBy the experience of above four hundred years,\u201d says Doctor Burn,\n\u201cit seems time to lay aside all endeavours to bring under strict\nregulations, what in its own nature seems incapable of minute limitation;\nfor if all persons in the same kind of work were to receive equal wages,\nthere would be no emulation, and no room left for industry or ingenuity.\u201d\nParticular acts of parliament, however, still attempt sometimes to\nregulate wages in particular trades, and in particular places. Thus the\n8th of George III. prohibits, under heavy penalties, all master tailors in\nLondon, and five miles round it, from giving, and their workmen from\naccepting, more than two shillings and sevenpence halfpenny a-day, except\nin the case of a general mourning. Whenever the legislature attempts to\nregulate the differences between masters and their workmen, its\ncounsellors are always the masters. When the regulation, therefore, is in\nfavour of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is\nsometimes otherwise when in favour of the masters. Thus the law which\nobliges the masters in several different trades to pay their workmen in\nmoney, and not in goods, is quite just and equitable. It imposes no real\nhardship upon the masters. It only obliges them to pay that value in\nmoney, which they pretended to pay, but did not always really pay, in\ngoods. This law is in favour of the workmen; but the 8th of George III. is\nin favour of the masters. When masters combine together, in order to\nreduce the wages of their workmen, they commonly enter into a private bond\nor agreement, not to give more than a certain wage, under a certain\npenalty. Were the workmen to enter into a contrary combination of the same\nkind, not to accept of a certain wage, under a certain penalty, the law\nwould punish them very severely; and, if it dealt impartially, it would\ntreat the masters in the same manner. But the 8th of George III. enforces\nby law that very regulation which masters sometimes attempt to establish\nby such combinations. The complaint of the workmen, that it puts the\nablest and most industrious upon the same footing with an ordinary\nworkman, seems perfectly well founded.\nIn ancient times, too, it was usual to attempt to regulate the profits of\nmerchants and other dealers, by regulating the price of provisions and\nether goods. The assize of bread is, so far as I know, the only remnant of\nthis ancient usage. Where there is an exclusive corporation, it may,\nperhaps, be proper to regulate the price of the first necessary of life;\nbut, where there is none, the competition will regulate it much better\nthan any assize. The method of fixing the assize of bread, established by\nthe 31st of George II. could not be put in practice in Scotland, on\naccount of a defect in the law, its execution depending upon the office of\nclerk of the market, which does not exist there. This defect was not\nremedied till the third of George III. The want of an assize occasioned no\nsensible inconveniency; and the establishment of one in the few places\nwhere it has yet taken place has produced no sensible advantage. In the\ngreater part of the towns in Scotland, however, there is an incorporation\nof bakers, who claim exclusive privileges, though they are not very\nstrictly guarded. The proportion between the different rates, both of\nwages and profit, in the different employments of labour and stock, seems\nnot to be much affected, as has already been observed, by the riches or\npoverty, the advancing, stationary, or declining state of the society.\nSuch revolutions in the public welfare, though they affect the general\nrates both of wages and profit, must, in the end, affect them equally in\nall different employments. The proportion between them, therefore, must\nremain the same, and cannot well be altered, at least for any considerable\ntime, by any such revolutions.\nCHAPTER XI.\nOF THE RENT OF LAND.\nRent, considered as the price paid for the use of land, is naturally the\nhighest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of\nthe land. In adjusting the terms of the lease, the landlord endeavours to\nleave him no greater share of the produce than what is sufficient to keep\nup the stock from which he furnishes the seed, pays the labour, and\npurchases and maintains the cattle and other instruments of husbandry,\ntogether with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood.\nThis is evidently the smallest share with which the tenant can content\nhimself, without being a loser, and the landlord seldom means to leave him\nany more. Whatever part of the produce, or, what is the same thing,\nwhatever part of its price, is over and above this share, he naturally\nendeavours to reserve to himself as the rent of his land, which is\nevidently the highest the tenant can afford to pay in the actual\ncircumstances of the land. Sometimes, indeed, the liberality, more\nfrequently the ignorance, of the landlord, makes him accept of somewhat\nless than this portion; and sometimes, too, though more rarely, the\nignorance of the tenant makes him undertake to pay somewhat more, or to\ncontent himself with somewhat less, than the ordinary profits of farming\nstock in the neighbourhood. This portion, however, may still be considered\nas the natural rent of land, or the rent at which it is naturally meant\nthat land should, for the most part, be let.\nThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a\nreasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon\nits improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some\noccasions; for it can scarce ever be more than partly the case. The\nlandlord demands a rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed\ninterest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an\naddition to this original rent. Those improvements, besides, are not\nalways made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the\ntenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly\ndemands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his\nown.\nHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human\nimprovements. Kelp is a species of sea-weed, which, when burnt, yields an\nalkaline salt, useful for making glass, soap, and for several other\npurposes. It grows in several parts of Great Britain, particularly in\nScotland, upon such rocks only as lie within the high-water mark, which\nare twice every day covered with the sea, and of which the produce,\ntherefore, was never augmented by human industry. The landlord, however,\nwhose estate is bounded by a kelp shore of this kind, demands a rent for\nit as much as for his corn-fields.\nThe sea in the neighbourhood of the islands of Shetland is more than\ncommonly abundant in fish, which makes a great part of the subsistence of\ntheir inhabitants. But, in order to profit by the produce of the water,\nthey must have a habitation upon the neighbouring land. The rent of the\nlandlord is in proportion, not to what the farmer can make by the land,\nbut to what he can make both by the land and the water. It is partly paid\nin sea-fish; and one of the very few instances in which rent makes a part\nof the price of that commodity, is to be found in that country.\nThe rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the use of\nthe land, is naturally a monopoly price. It is not at all proportioned to\nwhat the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land, or\nto what he can afford to take, but to what the farmer can afford to give.\nSuch parts only of the produce of land can commonly be brought to market,\nof which the ordinary price is sufficient to replace the stock which must\nbe employed in bringing them thither, together with its ordinary profits.\nIf the ordinary price is more than this, the surplus part of it will\nnaturally go to the rent of the land. If it is not more, though the\ncommodity may be brought to market, it can afford no rent to the landlord.\nWhether the price is, or is not more, depends upon the demand.\nThere are some parts of the produce of land, for which the demand must\nalways be such as to afford a greater price than what is sufficient to\nbring them to market; and there are others for which it either may or may\nnot be such as to afford this greater price. The former must always afford\na rent to the landlord. The latter sometimes may and sometimes may not,\naccording to different circumstances.\nRent, it is to be observed, therefore, enters into the composition of the\nprice of commodities in a different way from wages and profit. High or low\nwages and profit are the causes of high or low price; high or low rent is\nthe effect of it. It is because high or low wages and profit must be paid,\nin order to bring a particular commodity to market, that its price is high\nor low. But it is because its price is high or low, a great deal more, or\nvery little more, or no more, than what is sufficient to pay those wages\nand profit, that it affords a high rent, or a low rent, or no rent at all.\nThe particular consideration, first, of those parts of the produce of land\nwhich always afford some rent; secondly, of those which sometimes may and\nsometimes may not afford rent; and, thirdly, of the variations which, in\nthe different periods of improvement, naturally take place in the relative\nvalue of those two different sorts of rude produce, when compared both\nwith one another and with manufactured commodities, will divide this\nchapter into three parts.\nPART I.\u2014Of the Produce of Land which always affords Rent.\nAs men, like all other animals, naturally multiply in proportion to the\nmeans of their subsistence, food is always more or less in demand. It can\nalways purchase or command a greater or smaller quantity of labour, and\nsomebody can always be found who is willing to do something in order to\nobtain it. The quantity of labour, indeed, which it can purchase, is not\nalways equal to what it could maintain, if managed in the most economical\nmanner, on account of the high wages which are sometimes given to labour;\nbut it can always purchase such a quantity of labour as it can maintain,\naccording to the rate at which that sort of labour is commonly maintained\nin the neighbourhood.\nBut land, in almost any situation, produces a greater quantity of food\nthan what is sufficient to maintain all the labour necessary for bringing\nit to market, in the most liberal way in which that labour is ever\nmaintained. The surplus, too, is always more than sufficient to replace\nthe stock which employed that labour, together with its profits.\nSomething, therefore, always remains for a rent to the landlord.\nThe most desert moors in Norway and Scotland produce some sort of pasture\nfor cattle, of which the milk and the increase are always more than\nsufficient, not only to maintain all the labour necessary for tending\nthem, and to pay the ordinary profit to the farmer or the owner of the\nherd or flock, but to afford some small rent to the landlord. The rent\nincreases in proportion to the goodness of the pasture. The same extent of\nground not only maintains a greater number of cattle, but as they are\nbrought within a smaller compass, less labour becomes requisite to tend\nthem, and to collect their produce. The landlord gains both ways; by the\nincrease of the produce, and by the diminution of the labour which must be\nmaintained out of it.\nThe rent of land not only varies with its fertility, whatever be its\nproduce, but with its situation, whatever be its fertility. Land in the\nneighbourhood of a town gives a greater rent than land equally fertile in\na distant part of the country. Though it may cost no more labour to\ncultivate the one than the other, it must always cost more to bring the\nproduce of the distant land to market. A greater quantity of labour,\ntherefore, must be maintained out of it; and the surplus, from which are\ndrawn both the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord, must be\ndiminished. But in remote parts of the country, the rate of profit, as has\nalready been shewn, is generally higher than in the neighbourhood of a\nlarge town. A smaller proportion of this diminished surplus, therefore,\nmust belong to the landlord.\nGood roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expense of\ncarriage, put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level\nwith those in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon that account\nthe greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the\nremote, which must always be the most extensive circle of the country.\nThey are advantageous to the town by breaking down the monopoly of the\ncountry in its neighbourhood. They are advantageous even to that part of\nthe country. Though they introduce some rival commodities into the old\nmarket, they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly, besides, is a\ngreat enemy to good management, which can never be universally\nestablished, but in consequence of that free and universal competition\nwhich forces every body to have recourse to it for the sake of self\ndefence. It is not more than fifty years ago, that some of the counties in\nthe neighbourhood of London petitioned the parliament against the\nextension of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties. Those remoter\ncounties, they pretended, from the cheapness of labour, would be able to\nsell their grass and corn cheaper in the London market than themselves,\nand would thereby reduce their rents, and ruin their cultivation. Their\nrents, however, have risen, and their cultivation has been improved since\nthat time.\nA corn field of moderate fertility produces a much greater quantity of\nfood for man, than the best pasture of equal extent. Though its\ncultivation requires much more labour, yet the surplus which remains after\nreplacing the seed and maintaining all that labour, is likewise much\ngreater. If a pound of butcher\u2019s meat, therefore, was never supposed to be\nworth more than a pound of bread, this greater surplus would everywhere be\nof greater value and constitute a greater fund, both for the profit of the\nfarmer and the rent of the landlord. It seems to have done so universally\nin the rude beginnings of agriculture.\nBut the relative values of those two different species of food, bread and\nbutcher\u2019s meat, are very different in the different periods of\nagriculture. In its rude beginnings, the unimproved wilds, which then\noccupy the far greater part of the country, are all abandoned to cattle.\nThere is more butcher\u2019s meat than bread; and bread, therefore, is the food\nfor which there is the greatest competition, and which consequently brings\nthe greatest price. At Buenos Ayres, we are told by Ulloa, four reals,\none-and-twenty pence halfpenny sterling, was, forty or fifty years ago,\nthe ordinary price of an ox, chosen from a herd of two or three hundred.\nHe says nothing of the price of bread, probably because he found nothing\nremarkable about it. An ox there, he says, costs little more than the\nlabour of catching him. But corn can nowhere be raised without a great\ndeal of labour; and in a country which lies upon the river Plate, at that\ntime the direct road from Europe to the silver mines of Potosi, the\nmoney-price of labour could be very cheap. It is otherwise when\ncultivation is extended over the greater part of the country. There is\nthen more bread than butcher\u2019s meat. The competition changes its\ndirection, and the price of butcher\u2019s meat becomes greater than the price\nof bread.\nBy the extension, besides, of cultivation, the unimproved wilds become\ninsufficient to supply the demand for butcher\u2019s meat. A great part of the\ncultivated lands must be employed in rearing and fattening cattle; of\nwhich the price, therefore, must be sufficient to pay, not only the labour\nnecessary for tending them, but the rent which the landlord, and the\nprofit which the farmer, could have drawn from such land employed in\ntillage. The cattle bred upon the most uncultivated moors, when brought to\nthe same market, are, in proportion to their weight or goodness, sold at\nthe same price as those which are reared upon the most improved land. The\nproprietors of those moors profit by it, and raise the rent of their land\nin proportion to the price of their cattle. It is not more than a century\nago, that in many parts of the Highlands of Scotland, butcher\u2019s meat was\nas cheap or cheaper than even bread made of oatmeal. The Union opened the\nmarket of England to the Highland cattle. Their ordinary price, at\npresent, is about three times greater than at the beginning of the\ncentury, and the rents of many Highland estates have been tripled and\nquadrupled in the same time. In almost every part of Great Britain, a\npound of the best butcher\u2019s meat is, in the present times, generally worth\nmore than two pounds of the best white bread; and in plentiful years it is\nsometimes worth three or four pounds.\nIt is thus that, in the progress of improvement, the rent and profit of\nunimproved pasture come to be regulated in some measure by the rent and\nprofit of what is improved, and these again by the rent and profit of\ncorn. Corn is an annual crop; butcher\u2019s meat, a crop which requires four\nor five years to grow. As an acre of land, therefore, will produce a much\nsmaller quantity of the one species of food than of the other, the\ninferiority of the quantity must be compensated by the superiority of the\nprice. If it was more than compensated, more corn-land would be turned\ninto pasture; and if it was not compensated, part of what was in pasture\nwould be brought back into corn.\nThis equality, however, between the rent and profit of grass and those of\ncorn; of the land of which the immediate produce is food for cattle, and\nof that of which the immediate produce is food for men, must be understood\nto take place only through the greater part of the improved lands of a\ngreat country. In some particular local situations it is quite otherwise,\nand the rent and profit of grass are much superior to what can be made by\ncorn.\nThus, in the neighbourhood of a great town, the demand for milk, and for\nforage to horses, frequently contribute, together with the high price of\nbutcher\u2019s meat, to raise the value of grass above what may be called its\nnatural proportion to that of corn. This local advantage, it is evident,\ncannot be communicated to the lands at a distance.\nParticular circumstances have sometimes rendered some countries so\npopulous, that the whole territory, like the lands in the neighbourhood of\na great town, has not been sufficient to produce both the grass and the\ncorn necessary for the subsistence of their inhabitants. Their lands,\ntherefore, have been principally employed in the production of grass, the\nmore bulky commodity, and which cannot be so easily brought from a great\ndistance; and corn, the food of the great body of the people, has been\nchiefly imported from foreign countries. Holland is at present in this\nsituation; and a considerable part of ancient Italy seems to have been so\nduring the prosperity of the Romans. To feed well, old Cato said, as we\nare told by Cicero, was the first and most profitable thing in the\nmanagement of a private estate; to feed tolerably well, the second; and to\nfeed ill, the third. To plough, he ranked only in the fourth place of\nprofit and advantage. Tillage, indeed, in that part of ancient Italy which\nlay in the neighbour hood of Rome, must have been very much discouraged by\nthe distributions of corn which were frequently made to the people, either\ngratuitously, or at a very low price. This corn was brought from the\nconquered provinces, of which several, instead of taxes, were obliged to\nfurnish a tenth part of their produce at a stated price, about sixpence\na-peck, to the republic. The low price at which this corn was distributed\nto the people, must necessarily have sunk the price of what could be\nbrought to the Roman market from Latium, or the ancient territory of Rome,\nand must have discouraged its cultivation in that country.\nIn an open country, too, of which the principal produce is corn, a\nwell-inclosed piece of grass will frequently rent higher than any corn\nfield in its neighbourhood. It is convenient for the maintenance of the\ncattle employed in the cultivation of the corn; and its high rent is, in\nthis case, not so properly paid from the value of its own produce, as from\nthat of the corn lands which are cultivated by means of it. It is likely\nto fall, if ever the neighbouring lands are completely inclosed. The\npresent high rent of inclosed land in Scotland seems owing to the scarcity\nof inclosure, and will probably last no longer than that scarcity. The\nadvantage of inclosure is greater for pasture than for corn. It saves the\nlabour of guarding the cattle, which feed better, too, when they are not\nliable to be disturbed by their keeper or his dog.\nBut where there is no local advantage of this kind, the rent and profit of\ncorn, or whatever else is the common vegetable food of the people, must\nnaturally regulate upon the land which is fit for producing it, the rent\nand profit of pasture.\nThe use of the artificial grasses, of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and the\nother expedients which have been fallen upon to make an equal quantity of\nland feed a greater number of cattle than when in natural grass, should\nsomewhat reduce, it might be expected, the superiority which, in an\nimproved country, the price of butcher\u2019s meat naturally has over that of\nbread. It seems accordingly to have done so; and there is some reason for\nbelieving that, at least in the London market, the price of butcher\u2019s\nmeat, in proportion to the price of bread, is a good deal lower in the\npresent times than it was in the beginning of the last century.\nIn the Appendix to the life of Prince Henry, Doctor Birch has given us an\naccount of the prices of butcher\u2019s meat as commonly paid by that prince.\nIt is there said, that the four quarters of an ox, weighing six hundred\npounds, usually cost him nine pounds ten shillings, or thereabouts; that\nis thirty-one shillings and eight-pence per hundred pounds weight. Prince\nHenry died on the 6th of November 1612, in the nineteenth year of his age.\nIn March 1764, there was a parliamentary inquiry into the causes of the\nhigh price of provisions at that time. It was then, among other proof to\nthe same purpose, given in evidence by a Virginia merchant, that in March\n1763, he had victualled his ships for twentyfour or twenty-five shillings\nthe hundred weight of beef, which he considered as the ordinary price;\nwhereas, in that dear year, he had paid twenty-seven shillings for the\nsame weight and sort. This high price in 1764 is, however, four shillings\nand eight-pence cheaper than the ordinary price paid by Prince Henry; and\nit is the best beef only, it must be observed, which is fit to be salted\nfor those distant voyages.\nThe price paid by Prince Henry amounts to 3d. \u2158ths per pound weight of\nthe whole carcase, coarse and choice pieces taken together; and at that\nrate the choice pieces could not have been sold by retail for less than\n4\u00bdd. or 5d. the pound.\nIn the parliamentary inquiry in 1764, the witnesses stated the price of\nthe choice pieces of the best beef to be to the consumer 4d. and 4\u00bdd. the\npound; and the coarse pieces in general to be from seven farthings to 2\u00bdd.\nand 2\u00bed.; and this, they said, was in general one halfpenny dearer than\nthe same sort of pieces had usually been sold in the month of March. But\neven this high price is still a good deal cheaper than what we can well\nsuppose the ordinary retail price to have been in the time of Prince\nHenry.\nDuring the first twelve years of the last century, the average price of\nthe best wheat at the Windsor market was \u00a3 1:18:3\u00bdd. the quarter of nine\nWinchester bushels.\nBut in the twelve years preceding 1764 including that year, the average\nprice of the same measure of the best wheat at the same market was \u00a3\n2:1:9\u00bdd.\nIn the first twelve years of the last century, therefore, wheat appears to\nhave been a good deal cheaper, and butcher\u2019s meat a good deal dearer, than\nin the twelve years preceding 1764, including that year.\nIn all great countries, the greater part of the cultivated lands are\nemployed in producing either food for men or food for cattle. The rent and\nprofit of these regulate the rent and profit of all other cultivated land.\nIf any particular produce afforded less, the land would soon be turned\ninto corn or pasture; and if any afforded more, some part of the lands in\ncorn or pasture would soon be turned to that produce.\nThose productions, indeed, which require either a greater original expense\nof improvement, or a greater annual expense of cultivation in order to fit\nthe land for them, appear commonly to afford, the one a greater rent, the\nother a greater profit, than corn or pasture. This superiority, however,\nwill seldom be found to amount to more than a reasonable interest or\ncompensation for this superior expense.\nIn a hop garden, a fruit garden, a kitchen garden, both the rent of the\nlandlord, and the profit of the farmer, are generally greater than in\nacorn or grass field. But to bring the ground into this condition requires\nmore expense. Hence a greater rent becomes due to the landlord. It\nrequires, too, a more attentive and skilful management. Hence a greater\nprofit becomes due to the farmer. The crop, too, at least in the hop and\nfruit garden, is more precarious. Its price, therefore, besides\ncompensating all occasional losses, must afford something like the profit\nof insurance. The circumstances of gardeners, generally mean, and always\nmoderate, may satisfy us that their great ingenuity is not commonly\nover-recompensed. Their delightful art is practised by so many rich people\nfor amusement, that little advantage is to be made by those who practise\nit for profit; because the persons who should naturally be their best\ncustomers, supply themselves with all their most precious productions.\nThe advantage which the landlord derives from such improvements, seems at\nno time to have been greater than what was sufficient to compensate the\noriginal expense of making them. In the ancient husbandry, after the\nvineyard, a well-watered kitchen garden seems to have been the part of the\nfarm which was supposed to yield the most valuable produce. But\nDemocritus, who wrote upon husbandry about two thousand years ago, and who\nwas regarded by the ancients as one of the fathers of the art, thought\nthey did not act wisely who inclosed a kitchen garden. The profit, he\nsaid, would not compensate the expense of a stone-wall: and bricks (he\nmeant, I suppose, bricks baked in the sun) mouldered with the rain and the\nwinter-storm, and required continual repairs. Columella, who reports this\njudgment of Democritus, does not controvert it, but proposes a very frugal\nmethod of inclosing with a hedge of brambles and briars, which he says he\nhad found by experience to be both a lasting and an impenetrable fence;\nbut which, it seems, was not commonly known in the time of Democritus.\nPalladius adopts the opinion of Columella, which had before been\nrecommended by Varro. In the judgment of those ancient improvers, the\nproduce of a kitchen garden had, it seems, been little more than\nsufficient to pay the extraordinary culture and the expense of watering;\nfor in countries so near the sun, it was thought proper, in those times as\nin the present, to have the command of a stream of water, which could be\nconducted to every bed in the garden. Through the greater part of Europe,\na kitchen garden is not at present supposed to deserve a better inclosure\nthan that recommended by Columella. In Great Britain, and some other\nnorthern countries, the finer fruits cannot be brought to perfection but\nby the assistance of a wall. Their price, therefore, in such countries,\nmust be sufficient to pay the expense of building and maintaining what\nthey cannot be had without. The fruit-wall frequently surrounds the\nkitchen garden, which thus enjoys the benefit of an inclosure which its\nown produce could seldom pay for.\nThat the vineyard, when properly planted and brought to perfection, was\nthe most valuable part of the farm, seems to have been an undoubted maxim\nin the ancient agriculture, as it is in the modern, through all the wine\ncountries. But whether it was advantageous to plant a new vineyard, was a\nmatter of dispute among the ancient Italian husbandmen, as we learn from\nColumella. He decides, like a true lover of all curious cultivation, in\nfavour of the vineyard; and endeavours to shew, by a comparison of the\nprofit and expense, that it was a most advantageous improvement. Such\ncomparisons, however, between the profit and expense of new projects are\ncommonly very fallacious; and in nothing more so than in agriculture. Had\nthe gain actually made by such plantations been commonly as great as he\nimagined it might have been, there could have been no dispute about it.\nThe same point is frequently at this day a matter of controversy in the\nwine countries. Their writers on agriculture, indeed, the lovers and\npromoters of high cultivation, seem generally disposed to decide with\nColumella in favour of the vineyard. In France, the anxiety of the\nproprietors of the old vineyards to prevent the planting of any new ones,\nseems to favour their opinion, and to indicate a consciousness in those\nwho must have the experience, that this species of cultivation is at\npresent in that country more profitable than any other. It seems, at the\nsame time, however, to indicate another opinion, that this superior profit\ncan last no longer than the laws which at present restrain the free\ncultivation of the vine. In 1731, they obtained an order of council,\nprohibiting both the planting of new vineyards, and the renewal of these\nold ones, of which the cultivation had been interrupted for two years,\nwithout a particular permission from the king, to be granted only in\nconsequence of an information from the intendant of the province,\ncertifying that he had examined the land, and that it was incapable of any\nother culture. The pretence of this order was the scarcity of corn and\npasture, and the superabundance of wine. But had this superabundance been\nreal, it would, without any order of council, have effectually prevented\nthe plantation of new vineyards, by reducing the profits of this species\nof cultivation below their natural proportion to those of corn and\npasture. With regard to the supposed scarcity of corn occasioned by the\nmultiplication of vineyards, corn is nowhere in France more carefully\ncultivated than in the wine provinces, where the land is fit for producing\nit: as in Burgundy, Guienne, and the Upper Languedoc. The numerous hands\nemployed in the one species of cultivation necessarily encourage the\nother, by affording a ready market for its produce. To diminish the number\nof those who are capable of paying it, is surely a most unpromising\nexpedient for encouraging the cultivation of corn. It is like the policy\nwhich would promote agriculture, by discouraging manufactures.\nThe rent and profit of those productions, therefore, which require either\na greater original expense of improvement in order to fit the land for\nthem, or a greater annual expense of cultivation, though often much\nsuperior to those of corn and pasture, yet when they do no more than\ncompensate such extraordinary expense, are in reality regulated by the\nrent and profit of those common crops.\nIt sometimes happens, indeed, that the quantity of land which can be\nfitted for some particular produce, is too small to supply the effectual\ndemand. The whole produce can be disposed of to those who are willing to\ngive somewhat more than what is sufficient to pay the whole rent, wages,\nand profit, necessary for raising and bringing it to market, according to\ntheir natural rates, or according to the rates at which they are paid in\nthe greater part of other cultivated land. The surplus part of the price\nwhich remains after defraying the whole expense of improvement and\ncultivation, may commonly, in this case, and in this case only, bear no\nregular proportion to the like surplus in corn or pasture, but may exceed\nit in almost any degree; and the greater part of this excess naturally\ngoes to the rent of the landlord.\nThe usual and natural proportion, for example, between the rent and profit\nof wine, and those of corn and pasture, must be understood to take place\nonly with regard to those vineyards which produce nothing but good common\nwine, such as can be raised almost anywhere, upon any light, gravelly, or\nsandy soil, and which has nothing to recommend it but its strength and\nwholesomeness. It is with such vineyards only, that the common land of the\ncountry can be brought into competition; for with those of a peculiar\nquality it is evident that it cannot.\nThe vine is more affected by the difference of soils than any other\nfruit-tree. From some it derives a flavour which no culture or management\ncan equal, it is supposed, upon any other. This flavour, real or\nimaginary, is sometimes peculiar to the produce of a few vineyards;\nsometimes it extends through the greater part of a small district, and\nsometimes through a considerable part of a large province. The whole\nquantity of such wines that is brought to market falls short of the\neffectual demand, or the demand of those who would be willing to pay the\nwhole rent, profit, and wages, necessary for preparing and bringing them\nthither, according to the ordinary rate, or according to the rate at which\nthey are paid in common vineyards. The whole quantity, therefore, can be\ndisposed of to those who are willing to pay more, which necessarily raises\ntheir price above that of common wine. The difference is greater or less,\naccording as the fashionableness and scarcity of the wine render the\ncompetition of the buyers more or less eager. Whatever it be, the greater\npart of it goes to the rent of the landlord. For though such vineyards are\nin general more carefully cultivated than most others, the high price of\nthe wine seems to be, not so much the effect, as the cause of this careful\ncultivation. In so valuable a produce, the loss occasioned by negligence\nis so great, as to force even the most careless to attention. A small part\nof this high price, therefore, is sufficient to pay the wages of the\nextraordinary labour bestowed upon their cultivation, and the profits of\nthe extraordinary stock which puts that labour into motion.\nThe sugar colonies possessed by the European nations in the West Indies\nmay be compared to those precious vineyards. Their whole produce falls\nshort of the effectual demand of Europe, and can be disposed of to those\nwho are willing to give more than what is sufficient to pay the whole\nrent, profit, and wages, necessary for preparing and bringing it to\nmarket, according to the rate at which they are commonly paid by any other\nproduce. In Cochin China, the finest white sugar generally sells for three\npiastres the quintal, about thirteen shillings and sixpence of our money,\nas we are told by Mr Poivre {Voyages d\u2019un Philosophe.}, a very careful\nobserver of the agriculture of that country. What is there called the\nquintal, weighs from a hundred and fifty to two hundred Paris pounds, or a\nhundred and seventy-five Paris pounds at a medium, which reduces the price\nof the hundred weight English to about eight shillings sterling; not a\nfourth part of what is commonly paid for the brown or muscovada sugars\nimported from our colonies, and not a sixth part of what is paid for the\nfinest white sugar. The greater part of the cultivated lands in Cochin\nChina are employed in producing corn and rice, the food of the great body\nof the people. The respective prices of corn, rice, and sugar, are there\nprobably in the natural proportion, or in that which naturally takes place\nin the different crops of the greater part of cultivated land, and which\nrecompenses the landlord and farmer, as nearly as can be computed,\naccording to what is usually the original expense of improvement, and the\nannual expense of cultivation. But in our sugar colonies, the price of\nsugar bears no such proportion to that of the produce of a rice or corn\nfield either in Europe or America. It is commonly said that a sugar\nplanter expects that the rum and the molasses should defray the whole\nexpense of his cultivation, and that his sugar should be all clear profit.\nIf this be true, for I pretend not to affirm it, it is as if a corn farmer\nexpected to defray the expense of his cultivation with the chaff and the\nstraw, and that the grain should be all clear profit. We see frequently\nsocieties of merchants in London, and other trading towns, purchase waste\nlands in our sugar colonies, which they expect to improve and cultivate\nwith profit, by means of factors and agents, notwithstanding the great\ndistance and the uncertain returns, from the defective administration of\njustice in those countries. Nobody will attempt to improve and cultivate\nin the same manner the most fertile lands of Scotland, Ireland, or the\ncorn provinces of North America, though, from the more exact\nadministration of justice in these countries, more regular returns might\nbe expected.\nIn Virginia and Maryland, the cultivation of tobacco is preferred, as most\nprofitable, to that of corn. Tobacco might be cultivated with advantage\nthrough the greater part of Europe; but, in almost every part of Europe,\nit has become a principal subject of taxation; and to collect a tax from\nevery different farm in the country where this plant might happen to be\ncultivated, would be more difficult, it has been supposed, than to levy\none upon its importation at the custom-house. The cultivation of tobacco\nhas, upon this account, been most absurdly prohibited through the greater\npart of Europe, which necessarily gives a sort of monopoly to the\ncountries where it is allowed; and as Virginia and Maryland produce the\ngreatest quantity of it, they share largely, though with some competitors,\nin the advantage of this monopoly. The cultivation of tobacco, however,\nseems not to be so advantageous as that of sugar. I have never even heard\nof any tobacco plantation that was improved and cultivated by the capital\nof merchants who resided in Great Britain; and our tobacco colonies send\nus home no such wealthy planters as we see frequently arrive from our\nsugar islands. Though, from the preference given in those colonies to the\ncultivation of tobacco above that of corn, it would appear that the\neffectual demand of Europe for tobacco is not completely supplied, it\nprobably is more nearly so than that for sugar; and though the present\nprice of tobacco is probably more than sufficient to pay the whole rent,\nwages, and profit, necessary for preparing and bringing it to market,\naccording to the rate at which they are commonly paid in corn land, it\nmust not be so much more as the present price of sugar. Our tobacco\nplanters, accordingly, have shewn the same fear of the superabundance of\ntobacco, which the proprietors of the old vineyards in France have of the\nsuperabundance of wine. By act of assembly, they have restrained its\ncultivation to six thousand plants, supposed to yield a thousand weight of\ntobacco, for every negro between sixteen and sixty years of age. Such a\nnegro, over and above this quantity of tobacco, can manage, they reckon,\nfour acres of Indian corn. To prevent the market from being overstocked,\ntoo, they have sometimes, in plentiful years, we are told by Dr Douglas\n{Douglas\u2019s Summary, vol. ii. p. 379, 373.} (I suspect he has been ill\ninformed), burnt a certain quantity of tobacco for every negro, in the\nsame manner as the Dutch are said to do of spices. If such violent methods\nare necessary to keep up the present price of tobacco, the superior\nadvantage of its culture over that of corn, if it still has any, will not\nprobably be of long continuance.\nIt is in this manner that the rent of the cultivated land, of which the\nproduce is human food, regulates the rent of the greater part of other\ncultivated land. No particular produce can long afford less, because the\nland would immediately be turned to another use; and if any particular\nproduce commonly affords more, it is because the quantity of land which\ncan be fitted for it is too small to supply the effectual demand.\nIn Europe, corn is the principal produce of land, which serves immediately\nfor human food. Except in particular situations, therefore, the rent of\ncorn land regulates in Europe that of all other cultivated land. Britain\nneed envy neither the vineyards of France, nor the olive plantations of\nItaly. Except in particular situations, the value of these is regulated by\nthat of corn, in which the fertility of Britain is not much inferior to\nthat of either of those two countries.\nIf, in any country, the common and favourite vegetable food of the people\nshould be drawn from a plant of which the most common land, with the same,\nor nearly the same culture, produced a much greater quantity than the most\nfertile does of corn; the rent of the landlord, or the surplus quantity of\nfood which would remain to him, after paying the labour, and replacing the\nstock of the farmer, together with its ordinary profits, would necessarily\nbe much greater. Whatever was the rate at which labour was commonly\nmaintained in that country, this greater surplus could always maintain a\ngreater quantity of it, and, consequently, enable the landlord to purchase\nor command a greater quantity of it. The real value of his rent, his real\npower and authority, his command of the necessaries and conveniencies of\nlife with which the labour of other people could supply him, would\nnecessarily be much greater.\nA rice field produces a much greater quantity of food than the most\nfertile corn field. Two crops in the year, from thirty to sixty bushels\neach, are said to be the ordinary produce of an acre. Though its\ncultivation, therefore, requires more labour, a much greater surplus\nremains after maintaining all that labour. In those rice countries,\ntherefore, where rice is the common and favourite vegetable food of the\npeople, and where the cultivators are chiefly maintained with it, a\ngreater share of this greater surplus should belong to the landlord than\nin corn countries. In Carolina, where the planters, as in other British\ncolonies, are generally both farmers and landlords, and where rent,\nconsequently, is confounded with profit, the cultivation of rice is found\nto be more profitable than that of corn, though their fields produce only\none crop in the year, and though, from the prevalence of the customs of\nEurope, rice is not there the common and favourite vegetable food of the\npeople.\nA good rice field is a bog at all seasons, and at one season a bog covered\nwith water. It is unfit either for corn, or pasture, or vineyard, or,\nindeed, for any other vegetable produce that is very useful to men; and\nthe lands which are fit for those purposes are not fit for rice. Even in\nthe rice countries, therefore, the rent of rice lands cannot regulate the\nrent of the other cultivated land which can never be turned to that\nproduce.\nThe food produced by a field of potatoes is not inferior in quantity to\nthat produced by a field of rice, and much superior to what is produced by\na field of wheat. Twelve thousand weight of potatoes from an acre of land\nis not a greater produce than two thousand weight of wheat. The food or\nsolid nourishment, indeed, which can be drawn from each of those two\nplants, is not altogether in proportion to their weight, on account of the\nwatery nature of potatoes. Allowing, however, half the weight of this root\nto go to water, a very large allowance, such an acre of potatoes will\nstill produce six thousand weight of solid nourishment, three times the\nquantity produced by the acre of wheat. An acre of potatoes is cultivated\nwith less expense than an acre of wheat; the fallow, which generally\nprecedes the sowing of wheat, more than compensating the hoeing and other\nextraordinary culture which is always given to potatoes. Should this root\never become in any part of Europe, like rice in some rice countries, the\ncommon and favourite vegetable food of the people, so as to occupy the\nsame proportion of the lands in tillage, which wheat and other sorts of\ngrain for human food do at present, the same quantity of cultivated land\nwould maintain a much greater number of people; and the labourers being\ngenerally fed with potatoes, a greater surplus would remain after\nreplacing all the stock, and maintaining all the labour employed in\ncultivation. A greater share of this surplus, too, would belong to the\nlandlord. Population would increase, and rents would rise much beyond what\nthey are at present.\nThe land which is fit for potatoes, is fit for almost every other useful\nvegetable. If they occupied the same proportion of cultivated land which\ncorn does at present, they would regulate, in the same manner, the rent of\nthe greater part of other cultivated land.\nIn some parts of Lancashire, it is pretended, I have been told, that bread\nof oatmeal is a heartier food for labouring people than wheaten bread, and\nI have frequently heard the same doctrine held in Scotland. I am, however,\nsomewhat doubtful of the truth of it. The common people in Scotland, who\nare fed with oatmeal, are in general neither so strong nor so handsome as\nthe same rank of people in England, who are fed with wheaten bread. They\nneither work so well, nor look so well; and as there is not the same\ndifference between the people of fashion in the two countries, experience\nwould seem to shew, that the food of the common people in Scotland is not\nso suitable to the human constitution as that of their neighbours of the\nsame rank in England. But it seems to be otherwise with potatoes. The\nchairmen, porters, and coal-heavers in London, and those unfortunate women\nwho live by prostitution, the strongest men and the most beautiful women\nperhaps in the British dominions, are said to be, the greater part of\nthem, from the lowest rank of people in Ireland, who are generally fed\nwith this root. No food can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing\nquality, or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human\nconstitution.\nIt is difficult to preserve potatoes through the year, and impossible to\nstore them like corn, for two or three years together. The fear of not\nbeing able to sell them before they rot, discourages their cultivation,\nand is, perhaps, the chief obstacle to their ever becoming in any great\ncountry, like bread, the principal vegetable food of all the different\nranks of the people.\nPART II.\u2014Of the Produce of Land, which sometimes does, and sometimes\ndoes not, afford Rent.\nHuman food seems to be the only produce of land, which always and\nnecessarily affords some rent to the landlord. Other sorts of produce\nsometimes may, and sometimes may not, according to different\ncircumstances.\nAfter food, clothing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind.\nLand, in its original rude state, can afford the materials of clothing and\nlodging to a much greater number of people than it can feed. In its\nimproved state, it can sometimes feed a greater number of people than it\ncan supply with those materials; at least in the way in which they require\nthem, and are willing to pay for them. In the one state, therefore, there\nis always a superabundance of these materials, which are frequently, upon\nthat account, of little or no value. In the other, there is often a\nscarcity, which necessarily augments their value. In the one state, a\ngreat part of them is thrown away as useless and the price of what is used\nis considered as equal only to the labour and expense of fitting it for\nuse, and can, therefore, afford no rent to the landlord. In the other,\nthey are all made use of, and there is frequently a demand for more than\ncan be had. Somebody is always willing to give more for every part of\nthem, than what is sufficient to pay the expense of bringing them to\nmarket. Their price, therefore, can always afford some rent to the\nlandlord.\nThe skins of the larger animals were the original materials of clothing.\nAmong nations of hunters and shepherds, therefore, whose food consists\nchiefly in the flesh of those animals, everyman, by providing himself with\nfood, provides himself with the materials of more clothing than he can\nwear. If there was no foreign commerce, the greater part of them would be\nthrown away as things of no value. This was probably the case among the\nhunting nations of North America, before their country was discovered by\nthe Europeans, with whom they now exchange their surplus peltry, for\nblankets, fire-arms, and brandy, which gives it some value. In the present\ncommercial state of the known world, the most barbarous nations, I\nbelieve, among whom land property is established, have some foreign\ncommerce of this kind, and find among their wealthier neighbours such a\ndemand for all the materials of clothing, which their land produces, and\nwhich can neither be wrought up nor consumed at home, as raises their\nprice above what it costs to send them to those wealthier neighbours. It\naffords, therefore, some rent to the landlord. When the greater part of\nthe Highland cattle were consumed on their own hills, the exportation of\ntheir hides made the most considerable article of the commerce of that\ncountry, and what they were exchanged for afforded some addition to the\nrent of the Highland estates. The wool of England, which in old times,\ncould neither be consumed nor wrought up at home, found a market in the\nthen wealthier and more industrious country of Flanders, and its price\nafforded something to the rent of the land which produced it. In countries\nnot better cultivated than England was then, or than the Highlands of\nScotland are now, and which had no foreign commerce, the materials of\nclothing would evidently be so superabundant, that a great part of them\nwould be thrown away as useless, and no part could afford any rent to the\nlandlord.\nThe materials of lodging cannot always be transported to so great a\ndistance as those of clothing, and do not so readily become an object of\nforeign commerce. When they are superabundant in the country which\nproduces them, it frequently happens, even in the present commercial state\nof the world, that they are of no value to the landlord. A good stone\nquarry in the neighbourhood of London would afford a considerable rent. In\nmany parts of Scotland and Wales it affords none. Barren timber for\nbuilding is of great value in a populous and well-cultivated country, and\nthe land which produces it affords a considerable rent. But in many parts\nof North America, the landlord would be much obliged to any body who would\ncarry away the greater part of his large trees. In some parts of the\nHighlands of Scotland, the bark is the only part of the wood which, for\nwant of roads and water-carriage, can be sent to market; the timber is\nleft to rot upon the ground. When the materials of lodging are so\nsuperabundant, the part made use of is worth only the labour and expense\nof fitting it for that use. It affords no rent to the landlord, who\ngenerally grants the use of it to whoever takes the trouble of asking it.\nThe demand of wealthier nations, however, sometimes enables him to get a\nrent for it. The paving of the streets of London has enabled the owners of\nsome barren rocks on the coast of Scotland to draw a rent from what never\nafforded any before. The woods of Norway, and of the coasts of the Baltic,\nfind a market in many parts of Great Britain, which they could not find at\nhome, and thereby afford some rent to their proprietors.\nCountries are populous, not in proportion to the number of people whom\ntheir produce can clothe and lodge, but in proportion to that of those\nwhom it can feed. When food is provided, it is easy to find the necessary\nclothing and lodging. But though these are at hand, it may often be\ndifficult to find food. In some parts of the British dominions, what is\ncalled a house may be built by one day\u2019s labour of one man. The simplest\nspecies of clothing, the skins of animals, require somewhat more labour to\ndress and prepare them for use. They do not, however, require a great\ndeal. Among savage or barbarous nations, a hundredth, or little more than\na hundredth part of the labour of the whole year, will be sufficient to\nprovide them with such clothing and lodging as satisfy the greater part of\nthe people. All the other ninety-nine parts are frequently no more than\nenough to provide them with food.\nBut when, by the improvement and cultivation of land, the labour of one\nfamily can provide food for two, the labour of half the society becomes\nsufficient to provide food for the whole. The other half, therefore, or at\nleast the greater part of them, can be employed in providing other things,\nor in satisfying the other wants and fancies of mankind. Clothing and\nlodging, household furniture, and what is called equipage, are the\nprincipal objects of the greater part of those wants and fancies. The rich\nman consumes no more food than his poor neighbour. In quality it may be\nvery different, and to select and prepare it may require more labour and\nart; but in quantity it is very nearly the same. But compare the spacious\npalace and great wardrobe of the one, with the hovel and the few rags of\nthe other, and you will be sensible that the difference between their\nclothing, lodging, and household furniture, is almost as great in quantity\nas it is in quality. The desire of food is limited in every man by the\nnarrow capacity of the human stomach; but the desire of the conveniencies\nand ornaments of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture, seems\nto have no limit or certain boundary. Those, therefore, who have the\ncommand of more food than they themselves can consume, are always willing\nto exchange the surplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of it, for\ngratifications of this other kind. What is over and above satisfying the\nlimited desire, is given for the amusement of those desires which cannot\nbe satisfied, but seem to be altogether endless. The poor, in order to\nobtain food, exert themselves to gratify those fancies of the rich; and to\nobtain it more certainly, they vie with one another in the cheapness and\nperfection of their work. The number of workmen increases with the\nincreasing quantity of food, or with the growing improvement and\ncultivation of the lands; and as the nature of their business admits of\nthe utmost subdivisions of labour, the quantity of materials which they\ncan work up, increases in a much greater proportion than their numbers.\nHence arises a demand for every sort of material which human invention can\nemploy, either usefully or ornamentally, in building, dress, equipage, or\nhousehold furniture; for the fossils and minerals contained in the bowels\nof the earth, the precious metals, and the precious stones.\nFood is, in this manner, not only the original source of rent, but every\nother part of the produce of land which afterwards affords rent, derives\nthat part of its value from the improvement of the powers of labour in\nproducing food, by means of the improvement and cultivation of land.\nThose other parts of the produce of land, however, which afterwards afford\nrent, do not afford it always. Even in improved and cultivated countries,\nthe demand for them is not always such as to afford a greater price than\nwhat is sufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together with its\nordinary profits, the stock which must be employed in bringing them to\nmarket. Whether it is or is not such, depends upon different\ncircumstances.\nWhether a coal mine, for example, can afford any rent, depends partly upon\nits fertility, and partly upon its situation.\nA mine of any kind may be said to be either fertile or barren, according\nas the quantity of mineral which can be brought from it by a certain\nquantity of labour, is greater or less than what can be brought by an\nequal quantity from the greater part of other mines of the same kind.\nSome coal mines, advantageously situated, cannot be wrought on account of\ntheir barrenness. The produce does not pay the expense. They can afford\nneither profit nor rent.\nThere are some, of which the produce is barely sufficient to pay the\nlabour, and replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock\nemployed in working them. They afford some profit to the undertaker of the\nwork, but no rent to the landlord. They can be wrought advantageously by\nnobody but the landlord, who, being himself the undertaker of the work,\ngets the ordinary profit of the capital which he employs in it. Many coal\nmines in Scotland are wrought in this manner, and can be wrought in no\nother. The landlord will allow nobody else to work them without paying\nsome rent, and nobody can afford to pay any.\nOther coal mines in the same country, sufficiently fertile, cannot be\nwrought on account of their situation. A quantity of mineral, sufficient\nto defray the expense of working, could be brought from the mine by the\nordinary, or even less than the ordinary quantity of labour: but in an\ninland country, thinly inhabited, and without either good roads or\nwater-carriage, this quantity could not be sold.\nCoals are a less agreeable fuel than wood: they are said too to be less\nwholesome. The expense of coals, therefore, at the place where they are\nconsumed, must generally be somewhat less than that of wood.\nThe price of wood, again, varies with the state of agriculture, nearly in\nthe same manner, and exactly for the same reason, as the price of cattle.\nIn its rude beginnings, the greater part of every country is covered with\nwood, which is then a mere incumbrance, of no value to the landlord, who\nwould gladly give it to any body for the cutting. As agriculture advances,\nthe woods are partly cleared by the progress of tillage, and partly go to\ndecay in consequence of the increased number of cattle. These, though they\ndo not increase in the same proportion as corn, which is altogether the\nacquisition of human industry, yet multiply under the care and protection\nof men, who store up in the season of plenty what may maintain them in\nthat of scarcity; who, through the whole year, furnish them with a greater\nquantity of food than uncultivated nature provides for them; and who, by\ndestroying and extirpating their enemies, secure them in the free\nenjoyment of all that she provides. Numerous herds of cattle, when allowed\nto wander through the woods, though they do not destroy the old trees,\nhinder any young ones from coming up; so that, in the course of a century\nor two, the whole forest goes to ruin. The scarcity of wood then raises\nits price. It affords a good rent; and the landlord sometimes finds that\nhe can scarce employ his best lands more advantageously than in growing\nbarren timber, of which the greatness of the profit often compensates the\nlateness of the returns. This seems, in the present times, to be nearly\nthe state of things in several parts of Great Britain, where the profit of\nplanting is found to be equal to that of either corn or pasture. The\nadvantage which the landlord derives from planting can nowhere exceed, at\nleast for any considerable time, the rent which these could afford him;\nand in an inland country, which is highly cultivated, it will frequently\nnot fall much short of this rent. Upon the sea-coast of a well-improved\ncountry, indeed, if coals can conveniently be had for fuel, it may\nsometimes be cheaper to bring barren timber for building from less\ncultivated foreign countries than to raise it at home. In the new town of\nEdinburgh, built within these few years, there is not, perhaps, a single\nstick of Scotch timber.\nWhatever may be the price of wood, if that of coals is such that the\nexpense of a coal fire is nearly equal to that of a wood one we may be\nassured, that at that place, and in these circumstances, the price of\ncoals is as high as it can be. It seems to be so in some of the inland\nparts of England, particularly in Oxfordshire, where it is usual, even in\nthe fires of the common people, to mix coals and wood together, and where\nthe difference in the expense of those two sorts of fuel cannot,\ntherefore, be very great. Coals, in the coal countries, are everywhere\nmuch below this highest price. If they were not, they could not bear the\nexpense of a distant carriage, either by land or by water. A small\nquantity only could be sold; and the coal masters and the coal proprietors\nfind it more for their interest to sell a great quantity at a price\nsomewhat above the lowest, than a small quantity at the highest. The most\nfertile coal mine, too, regulates the price of coals at all the other\nmines in its neighbourhood. Both the proprietor and the undertaker of the\nwork find, the one that he can get a greater rent, the other that he can\nget a greater profit, by somewhat underselling all their neighbours. Their\nneighbours are soon obliged to sell at the same price, though they cannot\nso well afford it, and though it always diminishes, and sometimes takes\naway altogether, both their rent and their profit. Some works are\nabandoned altogether; others can afford no rent, and can be wrought only\nby the proprietor.\nThe lowest price at which coals can be sold for any considerable time, is,\nlike that of all other commodities, the price which is barely sufficient\nto replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock which must be\nemployed in bringing them to market. At a coal mine for which the landlord\ncan get no rent, but, which he must either work himself or let it alone\naltogether, the price of coals must generally be nearly about this price.\nRent, even where coals afford one, has generally a smaller share in their\nprice than in that of most other parts of the rude produce of land. The\nrent of an estate above ground, commonly amounts to what is supposed to be\na third of the gross produce; and it is generally a rent certain and\nindependent of the occasional variations in the crop. In coal mines, a\nfifth of the gross produce is a very great rent, a tenth the common rent;\nand it is seldom a rent certain, but depends upon the occasional\nvariations in the produce. These are so great, that in a country where\nthirty years purchase is considered as a moderate price for the property\nof a landed estate, ten years purchase is regarded as a good price for\nthat of a coal mine.\nThe value of a coal mine to the proprietor, frequently depends as much\nupon its situation as upon its fertility. That of a metallic mine depends\nmore upon its fertility, and less upon its situation. The coarse, and\nstill more the precious metals, when separated from the ore, are so\nvaluable, that they can generally bear the expense of a very long land,\nand of the most distant sea carriage. Their market is not confined to the\ncountries in the neighbourhood of the mine, but extends to the whole\nworld. The copper of Japan makes an article of commerce in Europe; the\niron of Spain in that of Chili and Peru. The silver of Peru finds its way,\nnot only to Europe, but from Europe to China.\nThe price of coals in Westmoreland or Shropshire can have little effect on\ntheir price at Newcastle; and their price in the Lionnois can have none at\nall. The productions of such distant coal mines can never be brought into\ncompetition with one another. But the productions of the most distant\nmetallic mines frequently may, and in fact commonly are.\nThe price, therefore, of the coarse, and still more that of the precious\nmetals, at the most fertile mines in the world, must necessarily more or\nless affect their price at every other in it. The price of copper in Japan\nmust have some influence upon its price at the copper mines in Europe. The\nprice of silver in Peru, or the quantity either of labour or of other\ngoods which it will purchase there, must have some influence on its price,\nnot only at the silver mines of Europe, but at those of China. After the\ndiscovery of the mines of Peru, the silver mines of Europe were, the\ngreater part of them, abandoned. The value of silver was so much reduced,\nthat their produce could no longer pay the expense of working them, or\nreplace, with a profit, the food, clothes, lodging, and other necessaries\nwhich were consumed in that operation. This was the case, too, with the\nmines of Cuba and St. Domingo, and even with the ancient mines of Peru,\nafter the discovery of those of Potosi. The price of every metal, at every\nmine, therefore, being regulated in some measure by its price at the most\nfertile mine in the world that is actually wrought, it can, at the greater\npart of mines, do very little more than pay the expense of working, and\ncan seldom afford a very high rent to the landlord. Rent accordingly,\nseems at the greater part of mines to have but a small share in the price\nof the coarse, and a still smaller in that of the precious metals. Labour\nand profit make up the greater part of both.\nA sixth part of the gross produce may be reckoned the average rent of the\ntin mines of Cornwall, the most fertile that are known in the world, as we\nare told by the Rev. Mr Borlace, vice-warden of the stannaries. Some, he\nsays, afford more, and some do not afford so much. A sixth part of the\ngross produce is the rent, too, of several very fertile lead mines in\nScotland.\nIn the silver mines of Peru, we are told by Frezier and Ulloa, the\nproprietor frequently exacts no other acknowledgment from the undertaker\nof the mine, but that he will grind the ore at his mill, paying him the\nordinary multure or price of grinding. Till 1736, indeed, the tax of the\nking of Spain amounted to one fifth of the standard silver, which till\nthen might be considered as the real rent of the greater part of the\nsilver mines of Peru, the richest which have been known in the world. If\nthere had been no tax, this fifth would naturally have belonged to the\nlandlord, and many mines might have been wrought which could not then be\nwrought, because they could not afford this tax. The tax of the duke of\nCornwall upon tin is supposed to amount to more than five per cent. or one\ntwentieth part of the value; and whatever may be his proportion, it would\nnaturally, too, belong to the proprietor of the mine, if tin was duty\nfree. But if you add one twentieth to one sixth, you will find that the\nwhole average rent of the tin mines of Cornwall, was to the whole average\nrent of the silver mines of Peru, as thirteen to twelve. But the silver\nmines of Peru are not now able to pay even this low rent; and the tax upon\nsilver was, in 1736, reduced from one fifth to one tenth. Even this tax\nupon silver, too, gives more temptation to smuggling than the tax of one\ntwentieth upon tin; and smuggling must be much easier in the precious than\nin the bulky commodity. The tax of the king of Spain, accordingly, is said\nto be very ill paid, and that of the duke of Cornwall very well. Rent,\ntherefore, it is probable, makes a greater part of the price of tin at the\nmost fertile tin mines than it does of silver at the most fertile silver\nmines in the world. After replacing the stock employed in working those\ndifferent mines, together with its ordinary profits, the residue which\nremains to the proprietor is greater, it seems, in the coarse, than in the\nprecious metal.\nNeither are the profits of the undertakers of silver mines commonly very\ngreat in Peru. The same most respectable and well-informed authors\nacquaint us, that when any person undertakes to work a new mine in Peru,\nhe is universally looked upon as a man destined to bankruptcy and ruin,\nand is upon that account shunned and avoided by every body. Mining, it\nseems, is considered there in the same light as here, as a lottery, in\nwhich the prizes do not compensate the blanks, though the greatness of\nsome tempts many adventurers to throw away their fortunes in such\nunprosperous projects.\nAs the sovereign, however, derives a considerable part of his revenue from\nthe produce of silver mines, the law in Peru gives every possible\nencouragement to the discovery and working of new ones. Whoever discovers\na new mine, is entitled to measure off two hundred and forty-six feet in\nlength, according to what he supposes to be the direction of the vein, and\nhalf as much in breadth. He becomes proprietor of this portion of the\nmine, and can work it without paving any acknowledgment to the landlord.\nThe interest of the duke of Cornwall has given occasion to a regulation\nnearly of the same kind in that ancient dutchy. In waste and uninclosed\nlands, any person who discovers a tin mine may mark out its limits to a\ncertain extent, which is called bounding a mine. The bounder becomes the\nreal proprietor of the mine, and may either work it himself, or give it in\nlease to another, without the consent of the owner of the land, to whom,\nhowever, a very small acknowledgment must be paid upon working it. In both\nregulations, the sacred rights of private property are sacrificed to the\nsupposed interests of public revenue.\nThe same encouragement is given in Peru to the discovery and working of\nnew gold mines; and in gold the king\u2019s tax amounts only to a twentieth\npart of the standard rental. It was once a fifth, and afterwards a tenth,\nas in silver; but it was found that the work could not bear even the\nlowest of these two taxes. If it is rare, however, say the same authors,\nFrezier and Ulloa, to find a person who has made his fortune by a silver,\nit is still much rarer to find one who has done so by a gold mine. This\ntwentieth part seems to be the whole rent which is paid by the greater\npart of the gold mines of Chili and Peru. Gold, too, is much more liable\nto be smuggled than even silver; not only on account of the superior value\nof the metal in proportion to its bulk, but on account of the peculiar way\nin which nature produces it. Silver is very seldom found virgin, but, like\nmost other metals, is generally mineralized with some other body, from\nwhich it is impossible to separate it in such quantities as will pay for\nthe expense, but by a very laborious and tedious operation, which cannot\nwell be carried on but in work-houses erected for the purpose, and,\ntherefore, exposed to the inspection of the king\u2019s officers. Gold, on the\ncontrary, is almost always found virgin. It is sometimes found in pieces\nof some bulk; and, even when mixed, in small and almost insensible\nparticles, with sand, earth, and other extraneous bodies, it can be\nseparated from them by a very short and simple operation, which can be\ncarried on in any private house by any body who is possessed of a small\nquantity of mercury. If the king\u2019s tax, therefore, is but ill paid upon\nsilver, it is likely to be much worse paid upon gold; and rent must make a\nmuch smaller part of the price of gold than that of silver.\nThe lowest price at which the precious metals can be sold, or the smallest\nquantity of other goods for which they can be exchanged, during any\nconsiderable time, is regulated by the same principles which fix the\nlowest ordinary price of all other goods. The stock which must commonly be\nemployed, the food, clothes, and lodging, which must commonly be consumed\nin bringing them from the mine to the market, determine it. It must at\nleast be sufficient to replace that stock, with the ordinary profits.\nTheir highest price, however, seems not to be necessarily determined by\nany thing but the actual scarcity or plenty of these metals themselves. It\nis not determined by that of any other commodity, in the same manner as\nthe price of coals is by that of wood, beyond which no scarcity can ever\nraise it. Increase the scarcity of gold to a certain degree, and the\nsmallest bit of it may become more precious than a diamond, and exchange\nfor a greater quantity of other goods.\nThe demand for those metals arises partly from their utility, and partly\nfrom their beauty. If you except iron, they are more useful than, perhaps,\nany other metal. As they are less liable to rust and impurity, they can\nmore easily be kept clean; and the utensils, either of the table or the\nkitchen, are often, upon that account, more agreeable when made of them. A\nsilver boiler is more cleanly than a lead, copper, or tin one; and the\nsame quality would render a gold boiler still better than a silver one.\nTheir principal merit, however, arises from their beauty, which renders\nthem peculiarly fit for the ornaments of dress and furniture. No paint or\ndye can give so splendid a colour as gilding. The merit of their beauty is\ngreatly enhanced by their scarcity. With the greater part of rich people,\nthe chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches; which, in\ntheir eye, is never so complete as when they appear to possess those\ndecisive marks of opulence which nobody can possess but themselves. In\ntheir eyes, the merit of an object, which is in any degree either useful\nor beautiful, is greatly enhanced by its scarcity, or by the great labour\nwhich it requires to collect any considerable quantity of it; a labour\nwhich nobody can afford to pay but themselves. Such objects they are\nwilling to purchase at a higher price than things much more beautiful and\nuseful, but more common. These qualities of utility, beauty, and scarcity,\nare the original foundation of the high price of those metals, or of the\ngreat quantity of other goods for which they can everywhere be exchanged.\nThis value was antecedent to, and independent of their being employed as\ncoin, and was the quality which fitted them for that employment. That\nemployment, however, by occasioning a new demand, and by diminishing the\nquantity which could be employed in any other way, may have afterwards\ncontributed to keep up or increase their value.\nThe demand for the precious stones arises altogether from their beauty.\nThey are of no use but as ornaments; and the merit of their beauty is\ngreatly enhanced by their scarcity, or by the difficulty and expense of\ngetting them from the mine. Wages and profit accordingly make up, upon\nmost occasions, almost the whole of the high price. Rent comes in but for\na very small share, frequently for no share; and the most fertile mines\nonly afford any considerable rent. When Tavernier, a jeweller, visited the\ndiamond mines of Golconda and Visiapour, he was informed that the\nsovereign of the country, for whose benefit they were wrought, had ordered\nall of them to be shut up except those which yielded the largest and\nfinest stones. The other, it seems, were to the proprietor not worth the\nworking.\nAs the prices, both of the precious metals and of the precious stones, is\nregulated all over the world by their price at the most fertile mine in\nit, the rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is in\nproportion, not to its absolute, but to what may be called its relative\nfertility, or to its superiority over other mines of the same kind. If new\nmines were discovered, as much superior to those of Potosi, as they were\nsuperior to those of Europe, the value of silver might be so much degraded\nas to render even the mines of Potosi not worth the working. Before the\ndiscovery of the Spanish West Indies, the most fertile mines in Europe may\nhave afforded as great a rent to their proprietors as the richest mines in\nPeru do at present. Though the quantity of silver was much less, it might\nhave exchanged for an equal quantity of other goods, and the proprietor\u2019s\nshare might have enabled him to purchase or command an equal quantity\neither of labour or of commodities.\nThe value, both of the produce and of the rent, the real revenue which\nthey afforded, both to the public and to the proprietor, might have been\nthe same.\nThe most abundant mines, either of the precious metals, or of the precious\nstones, could add little to the wealth of the world. A produce, of which\nthe value is principally derived from its scarcity, is necessarily\ndegraded by its abundance. A service of plate, and the other frivolous\nornaments of dress and furniture, could be purchased for a smaller\nquantity of commodities; and in this would consist the sole advantage\nwhich the world could derive from that abundance.\nIt is otherwise in estates above ground. The value, both of their produce\nand of their rent, is in proportion to their absolute, and not to their\nrelative fertility. The land which produces a certain quantity of food,\nclothes, and lodging, can always feed, clothe, and lodge, a certain number\nof people; and whatever may be the proportion of the landlord, it will\nalways give him a proportionable command of the labour of those people,\nand of the commodities with which that labour can supply him. The value of\nthe most barren land is not diminished by the neighbourhood of the most\nfertile. On the contrary, it is generally increased by it. The great\nnumber of people maintained by the fertile lands afford a market to many\nparts of the produce of the barren, which they could never have found\namong those whom their own produce could maintain.\nWhatever increases the fertility of land in producing food, increases not\nonly the value of the lands upon which the improvement is bestowed, but\ncontributes likewise to increase that of many other lands, by creating a\nnew demand for their produce. That abundance of food, of which, in\nconsequence of the improvement of land, many people have the disposal\nbeyond what they themselves can consume, is the great cause of the demand,\nboth for the precious metals and the precious stones, as well as for every\nother conveniency and ornament of dress, lodging, household furniture, and\nequipage. Food not only constitutes the principal part of the riches of\nthe world, but it is the abundance of food which gives the principal part\nof their value to many other sorts of riches. The poor inhabitants of Cuba\nand St. Domingo, when they were first discovered by the Spaniards, used to\nwear little bits of gold as ornaments in their hair and other parts of\ntheir dress. They seemed to value them as we would do any little pebbles\nof somewhat more than ordinary beauty, and to consider them as just worth\nthe picking up, but not worth the refusing to any body who asked them,\nThey gave them to their new guests at the first request, without seeming\nto think that they had made them any very valuable present. They were\nastonished to observe the rage of the Spaniards to obtain them; and had no\nnotion that there could anywhere be a country in which many people had the\ndisposal of so great a superfluity of food; so scanty always among\nthemselves, that, for a very small quantity of those glittering baubles,\nthey would willingly give as much as might maintain a whole family for\nmany years. Could they have been made to understand this, the passion of\nthe Spaniards would not have surprised them.\nPART III.\u2014Of the variations in the Proportion between the respective\nValues of that sort of Produce which always affords Rent, and of that\nwhich sometimes does, and sometimes does not, afford Rent.\nThe increasing abundance of food, in consequence of the increasing\nimprovement and cultivation, must necessarily increase the demand for\nevery part of the produce of land which is not food, and which can be\napplied either to use or to ornament. In the whole progress of\nimprovement, it might, therefore, be expected there should be only one\nvariation in the comparative values of those two different sorts of\nproduce. The value of that sort which sometimes does, and sometimes does\nnot afford rent, should constantly rise in proportion to that which always\naffords some rent. As art and industry advance, the materials of clothing\nand lodging, the useful fossils and materials of the earth, the precious\nmetals and the precious stones, should gradually come to be more and more\nin demand, should gradually exchange for a greater and a greater quantity\nof food; or, in other words, should gradually become dearer and dearer.\nThis, accordingly, has been the case with most of these things upon most\noccasions, and would have been the case with all of them upon all\noccasions, if particular accidents had not, upon some occasions, increased\nthe supply of some of them in a still greater proportion than the demand.\nThe value of a free-stone quarry, for example, will necessarily increase\nwith the increasing improvement and population of the country round about\nit, especially if it should be the only one in the neighbourhood. But the\nvalue of a silver mine, even though there should not be another within a\nthousand miles of it, will not necessarily increase with the improvement\nof the country in which it is situated. The market for the produce of a\nfree-stone quarry can seldom extend more than a few miles round about it,\nand the demand must generally be in proportion to the improvement and\npopulation of that small district; but the market for the produce of a\nsilver mine may extend over the whole known world. Unless the world in\ngeneral, therefore, be advancing in improvement and population, the demand\nfor silver might not be at all increased by the improvement even of a\nlarge country in the neighbourhood of the mine. Even though the world in\ngeneral were improving, yet if, in the course of its improvements, new\nmines should be discovered, much more fertile than any which had been\nknown before, though the demand for silver would necessarily increase, yet\nthe supply might increase in so much a greater proportion, that the real\nprice of that metal might gradually fall; that is, any given quantity, a\npound weight of it, for example, might gradually purchase or command a\nsmaller and a smaller quantity of labour, or exchange for a smaller and a\nsmaller quantity of corn, the principal part of the subsistence of the\nlabourer.\nThe great market for silver is the commercial and civilized part of the\nworld.\nIf, by the general progress of improvement, the demand of this market\nshould increase, while, at the same time, the supply did not increase in\nthe same proportion, the value of silver would gradually rise in\nproportion to that of corn. Any given quantity of silver would exchange\nfor a greater and a greater quantity of corn; or, in other words, the\naverage money price of corn would gradually become cheaper and cheaper.\nIf, on the contrary, the supply, by some accident, should increase, for\nmany years together, in a greater proportion than the demand, that metal\nwould gradually become cheaper and cheaper; or, in other words, the\naverage money price of corn would, in spite of all improvements, gradually\nbecome dearer and dearer.\nBut if, on the other hand, the supply of that metal should increase nearly\nin the same proportion as the demand, it would continue to purchase or\nexchange for nearly the same quantity of corn; and the average money price\nof corn would, in spite of all improvements. continue very nearly the\nsame.\nThese three seem to exhaust all the possible combinations of events which\ncan happen in the progress of improvement; and during the course of the\nfour centuries preceding the present, if we may judge by what has happened\nboth in France and Great Britain, each of those three different\ncombinations seems to have taken place in the European market, and nearly\nin the same order, too, in which I have here set them down.\n_Digression concerning the Variations in the value of Silver during the\nCourse of the Four last Centuries._\nFirst Period.\u2014In 1350, and for some time before, the average price\nof the quarter of wheat in England seems not to have been estimated lower\nthan four ounces of silver, Tower weight, equal to about twenty shillings\nof our present money. From this price it seems to have fallen gradually to\ntwo ounces of silver, equal to about ten shillings of our present money,\nthe price at which we find it estimated in the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury, and at which it seems to have continued to be estimated till\nabout 1570.\nIn 1350, being the 25th of Edward III. was enacted what is called the\nStatute of Labourers. In the preamble, it complains much of the insolence\nof servants, who endeavoured to raise their wages upon their masters. It\ntherefore ordains, that all servants and labourers should, for the future,\nbe contented with the same wages and liveries (liveries in those times\nsignified not only clothes, but provisions) which they had been accustomed\nto receive in the 20th year of the king, and the four preceding years;\nthat, upon this account, their livery-wheat should nowhere be estimated\nhigher than tenpence a-bushel, and that it should always be in the option\nof the master to deliver them either the wheat or the money. Tenpence:\na-bushel, therefore, had, in the 25th of Edward III. been reckoned a very\nmoderate price of wheat, since it required a particular statute to oblige\nservants to accept of it in exchange for their usual livery of provisions;\nand it had been reckoned a reasonable price ten years before that, or in\nthe 16th year of the king, the term to which the statute refers. But in\nthe 16th year of Edward III. tenpence contained about half an ounce of\nsilver, Tower weight, and was nearly equal to half-a-crown of our present\nmoney. Four ounces of silver, Tower weight, therefore, equal to six\nshillings and eightpence of the money of those times, and to near twenty\nshillings of that of the present, must have been reckoned a moderate price\nfor the quarter of eight bushels.\nThis statute is surely a better evidence of what was reckoned, in those\ntimes, a moderate price of grain, than the prices of some particular\nyears, which have generally been recorded by historians and other writers,\non account of their extraordinary dearness or cheapness, and from which,\ntherefore, it is difficult to form any judgment concerning what may have\nbeen the ordinary price. There are, besides, other reasons for believing\nthat, in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and for some time\nbefore, the common price of wheat was not less than four ounces of silver\nthe quarter, and that of other grain in proportion.\nIn 1309, Ralph de Born, prior of St Augustine\u2019s, Canterbury, gave a feast\nupon his installation-day, of which William Thorn has preserved, not only\nthe bill of fare, but the prices of many particulars. In that feast were\nconsumed, 1st, fifty-three quarters of wheat, which cost nineteen pounds,\nor seven shillings, and twopence a-quarter, equal to about one-and-twenty\nshillings and sixpence of our present money; 2dly, fifty-eight quarters of\nmalt, which cost seventeen pounds ten shillings, or six shillings\na-quarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money; 3dly,\ntwenty quarters of oats, which cost four pounds, or four shillings\na-quarter, equal to about twelve shillings of our present money. The\nprices of malt and oats seem here to be higher than their ordinary\nproportion to the price of wheat.\nThese prices are not recorded, on account of their extraordinary dearness\nor cheapness, but are mentioned accidentally, as the prices actually paid\nfor large quantities of grain consumed at a feast, which was famous for\nits magnificence.\nIn 1262, being the 51st of Henry III. was revived an ancient statute,\ncalled the assize of bread and ale, which, the king says in the preamble,\nhad been made in the times of his progenitors, some time kings of England.\nIt is probably, therefore, as old at least as the time of his grandfather,\nHenry II. and may have been as old as the Conquest. It regulates the price\nof bread according as the prices of wheat may happen to be, from one\nshilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times. But\nstatutes of this kind are generally presumed to provide with equal care\nfor all deviations from the middle price, for those below it, as well as\nfor those above it. Ten shillings, therefore, containing six ounces of\nsilver, Tower weight, and equal to about thirty shillings of our present\nmoney, must, upon this supposition, have been reckoned the middle price of\nthe quarter of wheat when this statute was first enacted, and must have\ncontinued to be so in the 51st of Henry III. We cannot, therefore, be very\nwrong in supposing that the middle price was not less than one-third of\nthe highest price at which this statute regulates the price of bread, or\nthan six shillings and eightpence of the money of those times, containing\nfour ounces of silver, Tower weight.\nFrom these different facts, therefore, we seem to have some reason to\nconclude that, about the middle of the fourteenth century, and for a\nconsiderable time before, the average or ordinary price of the quarter of\nwheat was not supposed to be less than four ounces of silver, Tower\nweight.\nFrom about the middle of the fourteenth to the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury, what was reckoned the reasonable and moderate, that is, the\nordinary or average price of wheat, seems to have sunk gradually to about\none half of this price; so as at last to have fallen to about two ounces\nof silver, Tower weight, equal to about ten shillings of our present\nmoney. It continued to be estimated at this price till about 1570.\nIn the household book of Henry, the fifth earl of Northumberland, drawn up\nin 1512 there are two different estimations of wheat. In one of them it is\ncomputed at six shilling and eightpence the quarter, in the other at five\nshillings and eightpence only. In 1512, six shillings and eightpence\ncontained only two ounces of silver, Tower weight, and were equal to about\nten shillings of our present money.\nFrom the 25th of Edward III. to the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth,\nduring the space of more than two hundred years, six shillings and\neightpence, it appears from several different statutes, had continued to\nbe considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable, that is, the\nordinary or average price of wheat. The quantity of silver, however,\ncontained in that nominal sum was, during the course of this period,\ncontinually diminishing in consequence of some alterations which were made\nin the coin. But the increase of the value of silver had, it seems, so far\ncompensated the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the same\nnominal sum, that the legislature did not think it worth while to attend\nto this circumstance.\nThus, in 1436, it was enacted, that wheat might be exported without a\nlicence when the price was so low as six shillings and eightpence: and in\n1463, it was enacted, that no wheat should be imported if the price was\nnot above six shillings and eightpence the quarter: The legislature had\nimagined, that when the price was so low, there could be no inconveniency\nin exportation, but that when it rose higher, it became prudent to allow\nof importation. Six shillings and eightpence, therefore, containing about\nthe same quantity of silver as thirteen shillings and fourpence of our\npresent money (one-third part less than the same nominal sum contained in\nthe time of Edward III), had, in those times, been considered as what is\ncalled the moderate and reasonable price of wheat.\nIn 1554, by the 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary, and in 1558, by the 1st of\nElizabeth, the exportation of wheat was in the same manner prohibited,\nwhenever the price of the quarter should exceed six shillings and\neightpence, which did not then contain two penny worth more silver than\nthe same nominal sum does at present. But it had soon been found, that to\nrestrain the exportation of wheat till the price was so very low, was, in\nreality, to prohibit it altogether. In 1562, therefore, by the 5th of\nElizabeth, the exportation of wheat was allowed from certain ports,\nwhenever the price of the quarter should not exceed ten shillings,\ncontaining nearly the same quantity of silver as the like nominal sum does\nat present. This price had at this time, therefore, been considered as\nwhat is called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat. It agrees\nnearly with the estimation of the Northumberland book in 1512.\nThat in France the average price of grain was, in the same manner, much\nlower in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century,\nthan in the two centuries preceding, has been observed both by Mr Dupr\u00e9 de\nSt Maur, and by the elegant author of the Essay on the Policy of Grain.\nIts price, during the same period, had probably sunk in the same manner\nthrough the greater part of Europe.\nThis rise in the value of silver, in proportion to that of corn, may\neither have been owing altogether to the increase of the demand for that\nmetal, in consequence of increasing improvement and cultivation, the\nsupply, in the mean time, continuing the same as before; or, the demand\ncontinuing the same as before, it may have been owing altogether to the\ngradual diminution of the supply: the greater part of the mines which were\nthen known in the world being much exhausted, and, consequently, the\nexpense of working them much increased; or it may have been owing partly\nto the one, and partly to the other of those two circumstances. In the end\nof the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, the greater\npart of Europe was approaching towards a more settled form of government\nthan it had enjoyed for several ages before. The increase of security\nwould naturally increase industry and improvement; and the demand for the\nprecious metals, as well as for every other luxury and ornament, would\nnaturally increase with the increase of riches. A greater annual produce\nwould require a greater quantity of coin to circulate it; and a greater\nnumber of rich people would require a greater quantity of plate and other\nornaments of silver. It is natural to suppose, too, that the greater part\nof the mines which then supplied the European market with silver might be\na good deal exhausted, and have become more expensive in the working. They\nhad been wrought, many of them, from the time of the Romans.\nIt has been the opinion, however, of the greater part of those who have\nwritten upon the prices of commodities in ancient times, that, from the\nConquest, perhaps from the invasion of Julius Caesar, till the discovery\nof the mines of America, the value of silver was continually diminishing.\nThis opinion they seem to have been led into, partly by the observations\nwhich they had occasion to make upon the prices both of corn and of some\nother parts of the rude produce of land, and partly by the popular notion,\nthat as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every country with\nthe increase of wealth, so its value diminishes as it quantity increases.\nIn their observations upon the prices of corn, three different\ncircumstances seem frequently to have misled them.\nFirst, in ancient times, almost all rents were paid in kind; in a certain\nquantity of corn, cattle, poultry, etc. It sometimes happened, however,\nthat the landlord would stipulate, that he should be at liberty to demand\nof the tenant, either the annual payment in kind or a certain sum of money\ninstead of it. The price at which the payment in kind was in this manner\nexchanged for a certain sum of money, is in Scotland called the conversion\nprice. As the option is always in the landlord to take either the\nsubstance or the price, it is necessary, for the safety of the tenant,\nthat the conversion price should rather be below than above the average\nmarket price. In many places, accordingly, it is not much above one half\nof this price. Through the greater part of Scotland this custom still\ncontinues with regard to poultry, and in some places with regard to\ncattle. It might probably have continued to take place, too, with regard\nto corn, had not the institution of the public fiars put an end to it.\nThese are annual valuations, according to the judgment of an assize, of\nthe average price of all the different sorts of grain, and of all the\ndifferent qualities of each, according to the actual market price in every\ndifferent county. This institution rendered it sufficiently safe for the\ntenant, and much more convenient for the landlord, to convert, as they\ncall it, the corn rent, rather at what should happen to be the price of\nthe fiars of each year, than at any certain fixed price. But the writers\nwho have collected the prices of corn in ancient times seem frequently to\nhave mistaken what is called in Scotland the conversion price for the\nactual market price. Fleetwood acknowledges, upon one occasion, that he\nhad made this mistake. As he wrote his book, however, for a particular\npurpose, he does not think proper to make this acknowledgment till after\ntranscribing this conversion price fifteen times. The price is eight\nshillings the quarter of wheat. This sum in 1423, the year at which he\nbegins with it, contained the same quantity of silver as sixteen shillings\nof our present money. But in 1562, the year at which he ends with it, it\ncontained no more than the same nominal sum does at present.\nSecondly, they have been misled by the slovenly manner in which some\nancient statutes of assize had been sometimes transcribed by lazy copiers,\nand sometimes, perhaps, actually composed by the legislature.\nThe ancient statutes of assize seem to have begun always with determining\nwhat ought to be the price of bread and ale when the price of wheat and\nbarley were at the lowest; and to have proceeded gradually to determine\nwhat it ought to be, according as the prices of those two sorts of grain\nshould gradually rise above this lowest price. But the transcribers of\nthose statutes seem frequently to have thought it sufficient to copy the\nregulation as far as the three or four first and lowest prices; saving in\nthis manner their own labour, and judging, I suppose, that this was enough\nto show what proportion ought to be observed in all higher prices.\nThus, in the assize of bread and ale, of the 51st of Henry III. the price\nof bread was regulated according to the different prices of wheat, from\none shilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times.\nBut in the manuscripts from which all the different editions of the\nstatutes, preceding that of Mr Ruffhead, were printed, the copiers had\nnever transcribed this regulation beyond the price of twelve shillings.\nSeveral writers, therefore, being misled by this faulty transcription,\nvery naturally conclude that the middle price, or six shillings the\nquarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money, was the\nordinary or average price of wheat at that time.\nIn the statute of Tumbrel and Pillory, enacted nearly about the same time,\nthe price of ale is regulated according to every sixpence rise in the\nprice of barley, from two shillings, to four shillings the quarter. That\nfour shillings, however, was not considered as the highest price to which\nbarley might frequently rise in those times, and that these prices were\nonly given as an example of the proportion which ought to be observed in\nall other prices, whether higher or lower, we may infer from the last\nwords of the statute: \u201cEt sic deinceps crescetur vel diminuetur per sex\ndenarios.\u201d The expression is very slovenly, but the meaning is plain\nenough, \u201cthat the price of ale is in this manner to be increased or\ndiminished according to every sixpence rise or fall in the price of\nbarley.\u201d In the composition of this statute, the legislature itself seems\nto have been as negligent as the copiers were in the transcription of the\nother.\nIn an ancient manuscript of the Regiam Majestatem, an old Scotch law book,\nthere is a statute of assize, in which the price of bread is regulated\naccording to all the different prices of wheat, from tenpence to three\nshillings the Scotch boll, equal to about half an English quarter. Three\nshillings Scotch, at the time when this assize is supposed to have been\nenacted, were equal to about nine shillings sterling of our present money.\nMr Ruddiman seems {See his Preface to Anderson\u2019s Diplomata Scotiae.} to\nconclude from this, that three shillings was the highest price to which\nwheat ever rose in those times, and that tenpence, a shilling, or at most\ntwo shillings, were the ordinary prices. Upon consulting the manuscript,\nhowever, it appears evidently, that all these prices are only set down as\nexamples of the proportion which ought to be observed between the\nrespective prices of wheat and bread. The last words of the statute are\n\u201creliqua judicabis secundum praescripta, habendo respectum ad pretium\nbladi.\u201d\u2014\u201cYou shall judge of the remaining cases, according to what\nis above written, having respect to the price of corn.\u201d\nThirdly, they seem to have been misled too, by the very low price at which\nwheat was sometimes sold in very ancient times; and to have imagined, that\nas its lowest price was then much lower than in later times its ordinary\nprice must likewise have been much lower. They might have found, however,\nthat in those ancient times its highest price was fully as much above, as\nits lowest price was below any thing that had ever been known in later\ntimes. Thus, in 1270, Fleetwood gives us two prices of the quarter of\nwheat. The one is four pounds sixteen shillings of the money of those\ntimes, equal to fourteen pounds eight shillings of that of the present;\nthe other is six pounds eight shillings, equal to nineteen pounds four\nshillings of our present money. No price can be found in the end of the\nfifteenth, or beginning of the sixteenth century, which approaches to the\nextravagance of these. The price of corn, though at all times liable to\nvariation varies most in those turbulent and disorderly societies, in\nwhich the interruption of all commerce and communication hinders the\nplenty of one part of the country from relieving the scarcity of another.\nIn the disorderly state of England under the Plantagenets, who governed it\nfrom about the middle of the twelfth till towards the end of the fifteenth\ncentury, one district might be in plenty, while another, at no great\ndistance, by having its crop destroyed, either by some accident of the\nseasons, or by the incursion of some neighbouring baron, might be\nsuffering all the horrors of a famine; and yet if the lands of some\nhostile lord were interposed between them, the one might not be able to\ngive the least assistance to the other. Under the vigorous administration\nof the Tudors, who governed England during the latter part of the\nfifteenth, and through the whole of the sixteenth century, no baron was\npowerful enough to dare to disturb the public security.\nThe reader will find at the end of this chapter all the prices of wheat\nwhich have been collected by Fleetwood, from 1202 to 1597, both inclusive,\nreduced to the money of the present times, and digested, according to the\norder of time, into seven divisions of twelve years each. At the end of\neach division, too, he will find the average price of the twelve years of\nwhich it consists. In that long period of time, Fleetwood has been able to\ncollect the prices of no more than eighty years; so that four years are\nwanting to make out the last twelve years. I have added, therefore, from\nthe accounts of Eton college, the prices of 1598, 1599, 1600, and 1601. It\nis the only addition which I have made. The reader will see, that from the\nbeginning of the thirteenth till after the middle of the sixteenth\ncentury, the average price of each twelve years grows gradually lower and\nlower; and that towards the end of the sixteenth century it begins to rise\nagain. The prices, indeed, which Fleetwood has been able to collect, seem\nto have been those chiefly which were remarkable for extraordinary\ndearness or cheapness; and I do not pretend that any very certain\nconclusion can be drawn from them. So far, however, as they prove any\nthing at all, they confirm the account which I have been endeavouring to\ngive. Fleetwood himself, however, seems, with most other writers, to have\nbelieved, that, during all this period, the value of silver, in\nconsequence of its increasing abundance, was continually diminishing. The\nprices of corn, which he himself has collected, certainly do not agree\nwith this opinion. They agree perfectly with that of Mr Dupr\u00e9 de St Maur,\nand with that which I have been endeavouring to explain. Bishop Fleetwood\nand Mr Dupr\u00e9 de St Maur are the two authors who seem to have collected,\nwith the greatest diligence and fidelity, the prices of things in ancient\ntimes. It is somewhat curious that, though their opinions are so very\ndifferent, their facts, so far as they relate to the price of corn at\nleast, should coincide so very exactly.\nIt is not, however, so much from the low price of corn, as from that of\nsome other parts of the rude produce of land, that the most judicious\nwriters have inferred the great value of silver in those very ancient\ntimes. Corn, it has been said, being a sort of manufacture, was, in those\nrude ages, much dearer in proportion than the greater part of other\ncommodities; it is meant, I suppose, than the greater part of\nunmanufactured commodities, such as cattle, poultry, game of all kinds,\netc. That in those times of poverty and barbarism these were\nproportionably much cheaper than corn, is undoubtedly true. But this\ncheapness was not the effect of the high value of silver, but of the low\nvalue of those commodities. It was not because silver would in such times\npurchase or represent a greater quantity of labour, but because such\ncommodities would purchase or represent a much smaller quantity than in\ntimes of more opulence and improvement. Silver must certainly be cheaper\nin Spanish America than in Europe; in the country where it is produced,\nthan in the country to which it is brought, at the expense of a long\ncarriage both by land and by sea, of a freight, and an insurance.\nOne-and-twenty pence halfpenny sterling, however, we are told by Ulloa,\nwas, not many years ago, at Buenos Ayres, the price of an ox chosen from a\nherd of three or four hundred. Sixteen shillings sterling, we are told by\nMr Byron, was the price of a good horse in the capital of Chili. In a\ncountry naturally fertile, but of which the far greater part is altogether\nuncultivated, cattle, poultry, game of all kinds, etc. as they can be\nacquired with a very small quantity of labour, so they will purchase or\ncommand but a very small quantity. The low money price for which they may\nbe sold, is no proof that the real value of silver is there very high, but\nthat the real value of those commodities is very low.\nLabour, it must always be remembered, and not any particular commodity, or\nset of commodities, is the real measure of the value both of silver and of\nall other commodities.\nBut in countries almost waste, or but thinly inhabited, cattle, poultry,\ngame of all kinds, etc. as they are the spontaneous productions of Nature,\nso she frequently produces them in much greater quantities than the\nconsumption of the inhabitants requires. In such a state of things, the\nsupply commonly exceeds the demand. In different states of society, in\ndifferent states of improvement, therefore, such commodities will\nrepresent, or be equivalent, to very different quantities of labour.\nIn every state of society, in every stage of improvement, corn is the\nproduction of human industry. But the average produce of every sort of\nindustry is always suited, more or less exactly, to the average\nconsumption; the average supply to the average demand. In every different\nstage of improvement, besides, the raising of equal quantities of corn in\nthe same soil and climate, will, at an average, require nearly equal\nquantities of labour; or, what comes to the same thing, the price of\nnearly equal quantities; the continual increase of the productive powers\nof labour, in an improved state of cultivation, being more or less\ncounterbalanced by the continual increasing price of cattle, the principal\ninstruments of agriculture. Upon all these accounts, therefore, we may\nrest assured, that equal quantities of corn will, in every state of\nsociety, in every stage of improvement, more nearly represent, or be\nequivalent to, equal quantities of labour, than equal quantities of any\nother part of the rude produce of land. Corn, accordingly, it has already\nbeen observed, is, in all the different stages of wealth and improvement,\na more accurate measure of value than any other commodity or set of\ncommodities. In all those different stages, therefore, we can judge better\nof the real value of silver, by comparing it with corn, than by comparing\nit with any other commodity or set of commodities.\nCorn, besides, or whatever else is the common and favourite vegetable food\nof the people, constitutes, in every civilized country, the principal part\nof the subsistence of the labourer. In consequence of the extension of\nagriculture, the land of every country produces a much greater quantity of\nvegetable than of animal food, and the labourer everywhere lives chiefly\nupon the wholesome food that is cheapest and most abundant. Butcher\u2019s\nmeat, except in the most thriving countries, or where labour is most\nhighly rewarded, makes but an insignificant part of his subsistence;\npoultry makes a still smaller part of it, and game no part of it. In\nFrance, and even in Scotland, where labour is somewhat better rewarded\nthan in France, the labouring poor seldom eat butcher\u2019s meat, except upon\nholidays, and other extraordinary occasions. The money price of labour,\ntherefore, depends much more upon the average money price of corn, the\nsubsistence of the labourer, than upon that of butcher\u2019s meat, or of any\nother part of the rude produce of land. The real value of gold and silver,\ntherefore, the real quantity of labour which they can purchase or command,\ndepends much more upon the quantity of corn which they can purchase or\ncommand, than upon that of butcher\u2019s meat, or any other part of the rude\nproduce of land.\nSuch slight observations, however, upon the prices either of corn or of\nother commodities, would not probably have misled so many intelligent\nauthors, had they not been influenced at the same time by the popular\nnotion, that as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every\ncountry with the increase of wealth, so its value diminishes as its\nquantity increases. This notion, however, seems to be altogether\ngroundless.\nThe quantity of the precious metals may increase in any country from two\ndifferent causes; either, first, from the increased abundance of the mines\nwhich supply it; or, secondly, from the increased wealth of the people,\nfrom the increased produce of their annual labour. The first of these\ncauses is no doubt necessarily connected with the diminution of the value\nof the precious metals; but the second is not.\nWhen more abundant mines are discovered, a greater quantity of the\nprecious metals is brought to market; and the quantity of the necessaries\nand conveniencies of life for which they must be exchanged being the same\nas before, equal quantities of the metals must be exchanged for smaller\nquantities of commodities. So far, therefore, as the increase of the\nquantity of the precious metals in any country arises from the increased\nabundance of the mines, it is necessarily connected with some diminution\nof their value.\nWhen, on the contrary, the wealth of any country increases, when the\nannual produce of its labour becomes gradually greater and greater, a\ngreater quantity of coin becomes necessary in order to circulate a greater\nquantity of commodities: and the people, as they can afford it, as they\nhave more commodities to give for it, will naturally purchase a greater\nand a greater quantity of plate. The quantity of their coin will increase\nfrom necessity; the quantity of their plate from vanity and ostentation,\nor from the same reason that the quantity of fine statues, pictures, and\nof every other luxury and curiosity, is likely to increase among them. But\nas statuaries and painters are not likely to be worse rewarded in times of\nwealth and prosperity, than in times of poverty and depression, so gold\nand silver are not likely to be worse paid for.\nThe price of gold and silver, when the accidental discovery of more\nabundant mines does not keep it down, as it naturally rises with the\nwealth of every country, so, whatever be the state of the mines, it is at\nall times naturally higher in a rich than in a poor country. Gold and\nsilver, like all other commodities, naturally seek the market where the\nbest price is given for them, and the best price is commonly given for\nevery thing in the country which can best afford it. Labour, it must be\nremembered, is the ultimate price which is paid for every thing; and in\ncountries where labour is equally well rewarded, the money price of labour\nwill be in proportion to that of the subsistence of the labourer. But gold\nand silver will naturally exchange for a greater quantity of subsistence\nin a rich than in a poor country; in a country which abounds with\nsubsistence, than in one which is but indifferently supplied with it. If\nthe two countries are at a great distance, the difference may be very\ngreat; because, though the metals naturally fly from the worse to the\nbetter market, yet it may be difficult to transport them in such\nquantities as to bring their price nearly to a level in both. If the\ncountries are near, the difference will be smaller, and may sometimes be\nscarce perceptible; because in this case the transportation will be easy.\nChina is a much richer country than any part of Europe, and the difference\nbetween the price of subsistence in China and in Europe is very great.\nRice in China is much cheaper than wheat is any where in Europe. England\nis a much richer country than Scotland, but the difference between the\nmoney price of corn in those two countries is much smaller, and is but\njust perceptible. In proportion to the quantity or measure, Scotch corn\ngenerally appears to be a good deal cheaper than English; but, in\nproportion to its quality, it is certainly somewhat dearer. Scotland\nreceives almost every year very large supplies from England, and every\ncommodity must commonly be somewhat dearer in the country to which it is\nbrought than in that from which it comes. English corn, therefore, must be\ndearer in Scotland than in England; and yet in proportion to its quality,\nor to the quantity and goodness of the flour or meal which can be made\nfrom it, it cannot commonly be sold higher there than the Scotch corn\nwhich comes to market in competition with it.\nThe difference between the money price of labour in China and in Europe,\nis still greater than that between the money price of subsistence; because\nthe real recompence of labour is higher in Europe than in China, the\ngreater part of Europe being in an improving state, while China seems to\nbe standing still. The money price of labour is lower in Scotland than in\nEngland, because the real recompence of labour is much lower: Scotland,\nthough advancing to greater wealth, advances much more slowly than\nEngland. The frequency of emigration from Scotland, and the rarity of it\nfrom England, sufficiently prove that the demand for labour is very\ndifferent in the two countries. The proportion between the real recompence\nof labour in different countries, it must be remembered, is naturally\nregulated, not by their actual wealth or poverty, but by their advancing,\nstationary, or declining condition.\nGold and silver, as they are naturally of the greatest value among the\nrichest, so they are naturally of the least value among the poorest\nnations. Among savages, the poorest of all nations, they are scarce of any\nvalue.\nIn great towns, corn is always dearer than in remote parts of the country.\nThis, however, is the effect, not of the real cheapness of silver, but of\nthe real dearness of corn. It does not cost less labour to bring silver to\nthe great town than to the remote parts of the country; but it costs a\ngreat deal more to bring corn.\nIn some very rich and commercial countries, such as Holland and the\nterritory of Genoa, corn is dear for the same reason that it is dear in\ngreat towns. They do not produce enough to maintain their inhabitants.\nThey are rich in the industry and skill of their artificers and\nmanufacturers, in every sort of machinery which can facilitate and abridge\nlabour; in shipping, and in all the other instruments and means of\ncarriage and commerce: but they are poor in corn, which, as it must be\nbrought to them from distant countries, must, by an addition to its price,\npay for the carriage from those countries. It does not cost less labour to\nbring silver to Amsterdam than to Dantzic; but it costs a great deal more\nto bring corn. The real cost of silver must be nearly the same in both\nplaces; but that of corn must be very different. Diminish the real\nopulence either of Holland or of the territory of Genoa, while the number\nof their inhabitants remains the same; diminish their power of supplying\nthemselves from distant countries; and the price of corn, instead of\nsinking with that diminution in the quantity of their silver, which must\nnecessarily accompany this declension, either as its cause or as its\neffect, will rise to the price of a famine. When we are in want of\nnecessaries, we must part with all superfluities, of which the value, as\nit rises in times of opulence and prosperity, so it sinks in times of\npoverty and distress. It is otherwise with necessaries. Their real price,\nthe quantity of labour which they can purchase or command, rises in times\nof poverty and distress, and sinks in times of opulence and prosperity,\nwhich are always times of great abundance; for they could not otherwise be\ntimes of opulence and prosperity. Corn is a necessary, silver is only a\nsuperfluity.\nWhatever, therefore, may have been the increase in the quantity of the\nprecious metals, which, during the period between the middle of the\nfourteenth and that of the sixteenth century, arose from the increase of\nwealth and improvement, it could have no tendency to diminish their value,\neither in Great Britain, or in my other part of Europe. If those who have\ncollected the prices of things in ancient times, therefore, had, during\nthis period, no reason to infer the diminution of the value of silver from\nany observations which they had made upon the prices either of corn, or of\nother commodities, they had still less reason to infer it from any\nsupposed increase of wealth and improvement.\nSecond Period.\u2014But how various soever may have been the opinions of\nthe learned concerning the progress of the value of silver during the\nfirst period, they are unanimous concerning it during the second.\nFrom about 1570 to about 1640, during a period of about seventy years, the\nvariation in the proportion between the value of silver and that of corn\nheld a quite opposite course. Silver sunk in its real value, or would\nexchange for a smaller quantity of labour than before; and corn rose in\nits nominal price, and, instead of being commonly sold for about two\nounces of silver the quarter, or about ten shillings of our present money,\ncame to be sold for six and eight ounces of silver the quarter, or about\nthirty and forty shillings of our present money.\nThe discovery of the abundant mines of America seems to have been the sole\ncause of this diminution in the value of silver, in proportion to that of\ncorn. It is accounted for, accordingly, in the same manner by every body;\nand there never has been any dispute, either about the fact, or about the\ncause of it. The greater part of Europe was, during this period, advancing\nin industry and improvement, and the demand for silver must consequently\nhave been increasing; but the increase of the supply had, it seems, so far\nexceeded that of the demand, that the value of that metal sunk\nconsiderably. The discovery of the mines of America, it is to be observed,\ndoes not seem to have had any very sensible effect upon the prices of\nthings in England till after 1570; though even the mines of Potosi had\nbeen discovered more than twenty years before.\nFrom 1595 to 1620, both inclusive, the average price of the quarter of\nnine bushels of the best wheat, at Windsor market, appears, from the\naccounts of Eton college, to have been \u00a3 2:1:6 \u2079\u2044\u2081\u2083. From which sum,\nneglecting the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or 4s. 7 \u2153d., the price\nof the quarter of eight bushels comes out to have been \u00a3 1:16:10 \u2154. And\nfrom this sum, neglecting likewise the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or\n4s. 1 \u2151d., for the difference between the price of the best wheat and\nthat of the middle wheat, the price of the middle wheat comes out to have\nbeen about \u00a3 1:12:8 \u2078\u2044\u2089, or about six ounces and one-third of an ounce of\nsilver.\nFrom 1621 to 1636, both inclusive, the average price of the same measure\nof the best wheat, at the same market, appears, from the same accounts, to\nhave been \u00a3 2:10s.; from which, making the like deductions as in the\nforegoing case, the average price of the quarter of eight bushels of\nmiddle wheat comes out to have been \u00a3 1:19:6, or about seven ounces and\ntwo-thirds of an ounce of silver.\nThird Period.\u2014Between 1630 and 1640, or about 1636, the effect of\nthe discovery of the mines of America, in reducing the value of silver,\nappears to have been completed, and the value of that metal seems never to\nhave sunk lower in proportion to that of corn than it was about that time.\nIt seems to have risen somewhat in the course of the present century, and\nit had probably begun to do so, even some time before the end of the last.\nFrom 1637 to 1700, both inclusive, being the sixty-four last years of the\nlast century the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best\nwheat, at Windsor market, appears, from the same accounts, to have been \u00a3\n2:11:0 \u2153, which is only 1s. 0 \u2153d. dearer than it had been during the\nsixteen years before. But, in the course of these sixty-four years, there\nhappened two events, which must have produced a much greater scarcity of\ncorn than what the course of the seasons would otherwise have occasioned,\nand which, therefore, without supposing any further reduction in the\nvalue of silver, will much more than account for this very small\nenhancement of price.\nThe first of these events was the civil war, which, by discouraging\ntillage and interrupting commerce, must have raised the price of corn much\nabove what the course of the seasons would otherwise have occasioned. It\nmust have had this effect, more or less, at all the different markets in\nthe kingdom, but particularly at those in the neighbourhood of London,\nwhich require to be supplied from the greatest distance. In 1648,\naccordingly, the price of the best wheat, at Windsor market, appears, from\nthe same accounts, to have been \u00a3 4:5s., and, in 1649, to have been \u00a3 4,\nthe quarter of nine bushels. The excess of those two years above \u00a3 2:10s.\n(the average price of the sixteen years preceding 1637) is \u00a3 3:5s., which,\ndivided among the sixty four last years of the last century, will alone\nvery nearly account for that small enhancement of price which seems to\nhave taken place in them. These, however, though the highest, are by no\nmeans the only high prices which seem to have been occasioned by the civil\nwars.\nThe second event was the bounty upon the exportation of corn, granted in\n1688. The bounty, it has been thought by many people, by encouraging\ntillage, may, in a long course of years, have occasioned a greater\nabundance, and, consequently, a greater cheapness of corn in the home\nmarket, than what would otherwise have taken place there. How far the\nbounty could produce this effect at any time I shall examine hereafter: I\nshall only observe at present, that between 1688 and 1700, it had not time\nto produce any such effect. During this short period, its only effect must\nhave been, by encouraging the exportation of the surplus produce of every\nyear, and thereby hindering the abundance of one year from compensating\nthe scarcity of another, to raise the price in the home market. The\nscarcity which prevailed in England, from 1693 to 1699, both inclusive,\nthough no doubt principally owing to the badness of the seasons, and,\ntherefore, extending through a considerable part of Europe, must have been\nsomewhat enhanced by the bounty. In 1699, accordingly, the further\nexportation of corn was prohibited for nine months.\nThere was a third event which occurred in the course of the same period,\nand which, though it could not occasion any scarcity of corn, nor,\nperhaps, any augmentation in the real quantity of silver which was usually\npaid for it, must necessarily have occasioned some augmentation in the\nnominal sum. This event was the great debasement of the silver coin, by\nclipping and wearing. This evil had begun in the reign of Charles II. and\nhad gone on continually increasing till 1695; at which time, as we may\nlearn from Mr Lowndes, the current silver coin was, at an average, near\nfive-and-twenty per cent. below its standard value. But the nominal sum\nwhich constitutes the market price of every commodity is necessarily\nregulated, not so much by the quantity of silver, which, according to the\nstandard, ought to be contained in it, as by that which, it is found by\nexperience, actually is contained in it. This nominal sum, therefore, is\nnecessarily higher when the coin is much debased by clipping and wearing,\nthan when near to its standard value.\nIn the course of the present century, the silver coin has not at any time\nbeen more below its standard weight than it is at present. But though very\nmuch defaced, its value has been kept up by that of the gold coin, for\nwhich it is exchanged. For though, before the late recoinage, the gold\ncoin was a good deal defaced too, it was less so than the silver. In 1695,\non the contrary, the value of the silver coin was not kept up by the gold\ncoin; a guinea then commonly exchanging for thirty shillings of the worn\nand clipt silver. Before the late recoinage of the gold, the price of\nsilver bullion was seldom higher than five shillings and sevenpence an\nounce, which is but fivepence above the mint price. But in 1695, the\ncommon price of silver bullion was six shillings and fivepence an ounce,\n{Lowndes\u2019s Essay on the Silver Coin, 68.} which is fifteen pence above the\nmint price. Even before the late recoinage of the gold, therefore, the\ncoin, gold and silver together, when compared with silver bullion, was not\nsupposed to be more than eight per cent. below its standard value, In\n1695, on the contrary, it had been supposed to be near five-and-twenty per\ncent. below that value. But in the beginning of the present century, that\nis, immediately after the great recoinage in King William\u2019s time, the\ngreater part of the current silver coin must have been still nearer to its\nstandard weight than it is at present. In the course of the present\ncentury, too, there has been no great public calamity, such as a civil\nwar, which could either discourage tillage, or interrupt the interior\ncommerce of the country. And though the bounty which has taken place\nthrough the greater part of this century, must always raise the price of\ncorn somewhat higher than it otherwise would be in the actual state of\ntillage; yet, as in the course of this century, the bounty has had full\ntime to produce all the good effects commonly imputed to it to encourage\ntillage, and thereby to increase the quantity of corn in the home market,\nit may, upon the principles of a system which I shall explain and examine\nhereafter, be supposed to have done something to lower the price of that\ncommodity the one way, as well as to raise it the other. It is by many\npeople supposed to have done more. In the sixty-four years of the present\ncentury, accordingly, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of\nthe best wheat, at Windsor market, appears, by the accounts of Eton\ncollege, to have been \u00a3 2:0:6 \u00b9\u2070\u2044\u2083\u2082, which is about ten shillings and\nsixpence, or more than five-and-twenty percent. cheaper than it had been\nduring the sixty-four last years of the last century; and about nine\nshillings and sixpence cheaper than it had been during the sixteen years\npreceding 1636, when the discovery of the abundant mines of America may be\nsupposed to have produced its full effect; and about one shilling cheaper\nthan it had been in the twenty-six years preceding 1620, before that\ndiscovery can well be supposed to have produced its full effect. According\nto this account, the average price of middle wheat, during these\nsixty-four first years of the present century, comes out to have been\nabout thirty-two shillings the quarter of eight bushels.\nThe value of silver, therefore, seems to have risen somewhat in proportion\nto that of corn during the course of the present century, and it had\nprobably begun to do so even some time before the end of the last.\nIn 1687, the price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat, at\nWindsor market, was \u00a3 1:5:2, the lowest price at which it had ever been\nfrom 1595.\nIn 1688, Mr Gregory King, a man famous for his knowledge in matters of\nthis kind, estimated the average price of wheat, in years of moderate\nplenty, to be to the grower 3s. 6d. the bushel, or eight-and-twenty\nshillings the quarter. The grower\u2019s price I understand to be the same with\nwhat is sometimes called the contract price, or the price at which a\nfarmer contracts for a certain number of years to deliver a certain\nquantity of corn to a dealer. As a contract of this kind saves the farmer\nthe expense and trouble of marketing, the contract price is generally\nlower than what is supposed to be the average market price. Mr King had\njudged eight-and-twenty shillings the quarter to be at that time the\nordinary contract price in years of moderate plenty. Before the scarcity\noccasioned by the late extraordinary course of bad seasons, it was, I have\nbeen assured, the ordinary contract price in all common years.\nIn 1688 was granted the parliamentary bounty upon the exportation of corn.\nThe country gentlemen, who then composed a still greater proportion of the\nlegislature than they do at present, had felt that the money price of corn\nwas falling. The bounty was an expedient to raise it artificially to the\nhigh price at which it had frequently been sold in the times of Charles I.\nand II. It was to take place, therefore, till wheat was so high as\nfortyeight shillings the quarter; that is, twenty shillings, or 5-7ths\ndearer than Mr King had, in that very year, estimated the grower\u2019s price\nto be in times of moderate plenty. If his calculations deserve any part of\nthe reputation which they have obtained very universally, eight-and-forty\nshillings the quarter was a price which, without some such expedient as\nthe bounty, could not at that time be expected, except in years of\nextraordinary scarcity. But the government of King William was not then\nfully settled. It was in no condition to refuse anything to the country\ngentlemen, from whom it was, at that very time, soliciting the first\nestablishment of the annual land-tax.\nThe value of silver, therefore, in proportion to that of corn, had\nprobably risen somewhat before the end of the last century; and it seems\nto have continued to do so during the course of the greater part of the\npresent, though the necessary operation of the bounty must have hindered\nthat rise from being so sensible as it otherwise would have been in the\nactual state of tillage.\nIn plentiful years, the bounty, by occasioning an extraordinary\nexportation, necessarily raises the price of corn above what it otherwise\nwould be in those years. To encourage tillage, by keeping up the price of\ncorn, even in the most plentiful years, was the avowed end of the\ninstitution.\nIn years of great scarcity, indeed, the bounty has generally been\nsuspended. It must, however, have had some effect upon the prices of many\nof those years. By the extraordinary exportation which it occasions in\nyears of plenty, it must frequently hinder the plenty of one year from\ncompensating the scarcity of another.\nBoth in years of plenty and in years of scarcity, therefore, the bounty\nraises the price of corn above what it naturally would be in the actual\nstate of tillage. If during the sixty-four first years of the present\ncentury, therefore, the average price has been lower than during the\nsixty-four last years of the last century, it must, in the same state of\ntillage, have been much more so, had it not been for this operation of the\nbounty.\nBut, without the bounty, it may be said the state of tillage would not\nhave been the same. What may have been the effects of this institution\nupon the agriculture of the country, I shall endeavour to explain\nhereafter, when I come to treat particularly of bounties. I shall only\nobserve at present, that this rise in the value of silver, in proportion\nto that of corn, has not been peculiar to England. It has been observed to\nhave taken place in France during the same period, and nearly in the same\nproportion, too, by three very faithful, diligent, and laborious\ncollectors of the prices of corn, Mr Dupr\u00e9 de St Maur, Mr Messance, and\nthe author of the Essay on the Police of Grain. But in France, till 1764,\nthe exportation of grain was by law prohibited; and it is somewhat\ndifficult to suppose, that nearly the same diminution of price which took\nplace in one country, notwithstanding this prohibition, should, in\nanother, be owing to the extraordinary encouragement given to exportation.\nIt would be more proper, perhaps, to consider this variation in the\naverage money price of corn as the effect rather of some gradual rise in\nthe real value of silver in the European market, than of any fall in the\nreal average value of corn. Corn, it has already been observed, is, at\ndistant periods of time, a more accurate measure of value than either\nsilver or, perhaps, any other commodity. When, after the discovery of the\nabundant mines of America, corn rose to three and four times its former\nmoney price, this change was universally ascribed, not to any rise in the\nreal value of corn, but to a fall in the real value of silver. If, during\nthe sixty-four first years of the present century, therefore, the average\nmoney price of corn has fallen somewhat below what it had been during the\ngreater part of the last century, we should, in the same manner, impute\nthis change, not to any fall in the real value of corn, but to some rise\nin the real value of silver in the European market.\nThe high price of corn during these ten or twelve years past, indeed, has\noccasioned a suspicion that the real value of silver still continues to\nfall in the European market. This high price of corn, however, seems\nevidently to have been the effect of the extraordinary unfavourableness of\nthe seasons, and ought, therefore, to be regarded, not as a permanent, but\nas a transitory and occasional event. The seasons, for these ten or twelve\nyears past, have been unfavourable through the greater part of Europe; and\nthe disorders of Poland have very much increased the scarcity in all those\ncountries, which, in dear years, used to be supplied from that market. So\nlong a course of bad seasons, though not a very common event, is by no\nmeans a singular one; and whoever has inquired much into the history of\nthe prices of corn in former times, will be at no loss to recollect\nseveral other examples of the same kind. Ten years of extraordinary\nscarcity, besides, are not more wonderful than ten years of extraordinary\nplenty. The low price of corn, from 1741 to 1750, both inclusive, may very\nwell be set in opposition to its high price during these last eight or ten\nyears. From 1741 to 1750, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels\nof the best wheat, at Windsor market, it appears from the accounts of Eton\ncollege, was only \u00a3 1:13:9 \u2158, which is nearly 6s.3d. below the average\nprice of the sixty-four first years of the present century. The average\nprice of the quarter of eight bushels of middle wheat comes out, according\nto this account, to have been, during these ten years, only \u00a3 1:6:8.\nBetween 1741 and 1750, however, the bounty must have hindered the price of\ncorn from falling so low in the home market as it naturally would have\ndone. During these ten years, the quantity of all sorts of grain exported,\nit appears from the custom-house books, amounted to no less than 8,029,156\nquarters, one bushel. The bounty paid for this amounted to \u00a3\n1,514,962:17:4 \u00bd. In 1749, accordingly, Mr Pelham, at that time prime\nminister, observed to the house of commons, that, for the three years\npreceding, a very extraordinary sum had been paid as bounty for the\nexportation of corn. He had good reason to make this observation, and in\nthe following year he might have had still better. In that single year,\nthe bounty paid amounted to no less than \u00a3 324,176:10:6. {See Tracts on\nthe Corn Trade, Tract 3,} It is unnecessary to observe how much this\nforced exportation must have raised the price of corn above what it\notherwise would have been in the home market.\nAt the end of the accounts annexed to this chapter the reader will find\nthe particular account of those ten years separated from the rest. He will\nfind there, too, the particular account of the preceding ten years, of\nwhich the average is likewise below, though not so much below, the general\naverage of the sixty-four first years of the century. The year 1740,\nhowever, was a year of extraordinary scarcity. These twenty years\npreceding 1750 may very well be set in opposition to the twenty preceding\n1770. As the former were a good deal below the general average of the\ncentury, notwithstanding the intervention of one or two dear years; so the\nlatter have been a good deal above it, notwithstanding the intervention of\none or two cheap ones, of 1759, for example. If the former have not been\nas much below the general average as the latter have been above it, we\nought probably to impute it to the bounty. The change has evidently been\ntoo sudden to be ascribed to any change in the value of silver, which is\nalways slow and gradual. The suddenness of the effect can be accounted for\nonly by a cause which can operate suddenly, the accidental variations of\nthe seasons.\nThe money price of labour in Great Britain has, indeed, risen during the\ncourse of the present century. This, however, seems to be the effect, not\nso much of any diminution in the value of silver in the European market,\nas of an increase in the demand for labour in Great Britain, arising from\nthe great, and almost universal prosperity of the country. In France, a\ncountry not altogether so prosperous, the money price of labour has, since\nthe middle of the last century, been observed to sink gradually with the\naverage money price of corn. Both in the last century and in the present,\nthe day wages of common labour are there said to have been pretty\nuniformly about the twentieth part of the average price of the septier of\nwheat; a measure which contains a little more than four Winchester\nbushels. In Great Britain, the real recompence of labour, it has already\nbeen shewn, the real quantities of the necessaries and conveniencies of\nlife which are given to the labourer, has increased considerably during\nthe course of the present century. The rise in its money price seems to\nhave been the effect, not of any diminution of the value of silver in the\ngeneral market of Europe, but of a rise in the real price of labour, in\nthe particular market of Great Britain, owing to the peculiarly happy\ncircumstances of the country.\nFor some time after the first discovery of America, silver would continue\nto sell at its former, or not much below its former price. The profits of\nmining would for some time be very great, and much above their natural\nrate. Those who imported that metal into Europe, however, would soon find\nthat the whole annual importation could not be disposed of at this high\nprice. Silver would gradually exchange for a smaller and a smaller\nquantity of goods. Its price would sink gradually lower and lower, till it\nfell to its natural price; or to what was just sufficient to pay,\naccording to their natural rates, the wages of the labour, the profits of\nthe stock, and the rent of the land, which must be paid in order to bring\nit from the mine to the market. In the greater part of the silver mines of\nPeru, the tax of the king of Spain, amounting to a tenth of the gross\nproduce, eats up, it has already been observed, the whole rent of the\nland. This tax was originally a half; it soon afterwards fell to a third,\nthen to a fifth, and at last to a tenth, at which late it still continues.\nIn the greater part of the silver mines of Peru, this, it seems, is all\nthat remains, after replacing the stock of the undertaker of the work,\ntogether with its ordinary profits; and it seems to be universally\nacknowledged that these profits, which were once very high, are now as low\nas they can well be, consistently with carrying on the works.\nThe tax of the king of Spain was reduced to a fifth of the registered\nsilver in 1504 {Solorzano, vol, ii.}, one-and-forty years before 1545, the\ndate of the discovery of the mines of Potosi. In the course of ninety\nyears, or before 1636, these mines, the most fertile in all America, had\ntime sufficient to produce their full effect, or to reduce the value of\nsilver in the European market as low as it could well fall, while it\ncontinued to pay this tax to the king of Spain. Ninety years is time\nsufficient to reduce any commodity, of which there is no monopoly, to its\nnatural price, or to the lowest price at which, while it pays a particular\ntax, it can continue to be sold for any considerable time together.\nThe price of silver in the European market might, perhaps, have fallen\nstill lower, and it might have become necessary either to reduce the tax\nupon it, not only to one-tenth, as in 1736, but to one twentieth, in the\nsame manner as that upon gold, or to give up working the greater part of\nthe American mines which are now wrought. The gradual increase of the\ndemand for silver, or the gradual enlargement of the market for the\nproduce of the silver mines of America, is probably the cause which has\nprevented this from happening, and which has not only kept up the value of\nsilver in the European market, but has perhaps even raised it somewhat\nhigher than it was about the middle of the last century.\nSince the first discovery of America, the market for the produce of its\nsilver mines has been growing gradually more and more extensive.\nFirst, the market of Europe has become gradually more and more extensive.\nSince the discovery of America, the greater part of Europe has been much\nimproved. England, Holland, France, and Germany; even Sweden, Denmark, and\nRussia, have all advanced considerably, both in agriculture and in\nmanufactures. Italy seems not to have gone backwards. The fall of Italy\npreceded the conquest of Peru. Since that time it seems rather to have\nrecovered a little. Spain and Portugal, indeed, are supposed to have gone\nbackwards. Portugal, however, is but a very small part of Europe, and the\ndeclension of Spain is not, perhaps, so great as is commonly imagined. In\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain was a very poor country,\neven in comparison with France, which has been so much improved since that\ntime. It was the well known remark of the emperor Charles V. who had\ntravelled so frequently through both countries, that every thing abounded\nin France, but that every thing was wanting in Spain. The increasing\nproduce of the agriculture and manufactures of Europe must necessarily\nhave required a gradual increase in the quantity of silver coin to\ncirculate it; and the increasing number of wealthy individuals must have\nrequired the like increase in the quantity of their plate and other\nornaments of silver.\nSecondly, America is itself a new market, for the produce of its own\nsilver mines; and as its advances in agriculture, industry, and\npopulation, are much more rapid than those of the most thriving countries\nin Europe, its demand must increase much more rapidly. The English\ncolonies are altogether a new market, which, partly for coin, and partly\nfor plate, requires a continual augmenting supply of silver through a\ngreat continent where there never was any demand before. The greater part,\ntoo, of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, are altogether new markets.\nNew Granada, the Yucatan, Paraguay, and the Brazils, were, before\ndiscovered by the Europeans, inhabited by savage nations, who had neither\narts nor agriculture. A considerable degree of both has now been\nintroduced into all of them. Even Mexico and Peru, though they cannot be\nconsidered as altogether new markets, are certainly much more extensive\nones than they ever were before. After all the wonderful tales which have\nbeen published concerning the splendid state of those countries in ancient\ntimes, whoever reads, with any degree of sober judgment, the history of\ntheir first discovery and conquest, will evidently discern that, in arts,\nagriculture, and commerce, their inhabitants were much more ignorant than\nthe Tartars of the Ukraine are at present. Even the Peruvians, the more\ncivilized nation of the two, though they made use of gold and silver as\nornaments, had no coined money of any kind. Their whole commerce was\ncarried on by barter, and there was accordingly scarce any division of\nlabour among them. Those who cultivated the ground, were obliged to build\ntheir own houses, to make their own household furniture, their own\nclothes, shoes, and instruments of agriculture. The few artificers among\nthem are said to have been all maintained by the sovereign, the nobles,\nand the priests, and were probably their servants or slaves. All the\nancient arts of Mexico and Peru have never furnished one single\nmanufacture to Europe. The Spanish armies, though they scarce ever\nexceeded five hundred men, and frequently did not amount to half that\nnumber, found almost everywhere great difficulty in procuring subsistence.\nThe famines which they are said to have occasioned almost wherever they\nwent, in countries, too, which at the same time are represented as very\npopulous and well cultivated, sufficiently demonstrate that the story of\nthis populousness and high cultivation is in a great measure fabulous. The\nSpanish colonies are under a government in many respects less favourable\nto agriculture, improvement, and population, than that of the English\ncolonies. They seem, however, to be advancing in all those much more\nrapidly than any country in Europe. In a fertile soil and happy climate,\nthe great abundance and cheapness of land, a circumstance common to all\nnew colonies, is, it seems, so great an advantage, as to compensate many\ndefects in civil government. Frezier, who visited Peru in 1713, represents\nLima as containing between twenty-five and twenty-eight thousand\ninhabitants. Ulloa, who resided in the same country between 1740 and 1746,\nrepresents it as containing more than fifty thousand. The difference in\ntheir accounts of the populousness of several other principal towns of\nChili and Peru is nearly the same; and as there seems to be no reason to\ndoubt of the good information of either, it marks an increase which is\nscarce inferior to that of the English colonies. America, therefore, is a\nnew market for the produce of its own silver mines, of which the demand\nmust increase much more rapidly than that of the most thriving country in\nEurope.\nThirdly, the East Indies is another market for the produce of the silver\nmines of America, and a market which, from the time of the first discovery\nof those mines, has been continually taking off a greater and a greater\nquantity of silver. Since that time, the direct trade between America and\nthe East Indies, which is carried on by means of the Acapulco ships, has\nbeen continually augmenting, and the indirect intercourse by the way of\nEurope has been augmenting in a still greater proportion. During the\nsixteenth century, the Portuguese were the only European nation who\ncarried on any regular trade to the East Indies. In the last years of that\ncentury, the Dutch began to encroach upon this monopoly, and in a few\nyears expelled them from their principal settlements in India. During the\ngreater part of the last century, those two nations divided the most\nconsiderable part of the East India trade between them; the trade of the\nDutch continually augmenting in a still greater proportion than that of\nthe Portuguese declined. The English and French carried on some trade with\nIndia in the last century, but it has been greatly augmented in the course\nof the present. The East India trade of the Swedes and Danes began in the\ncourse of the present century. Even the Muscovites now trade regularly\nwith China, by a sort of caravans which go over land through Siberia and\nTartary to Pekin. The East India trade of all these nations, if we except\nthat of the French, which the last war had well nigh annihilated, has been\nalmost continually augmenting. The increasing consumptions of East India\ngoods in Europe is, it seems, so great, as to afford a gradual increase of\nemployment to them all. Tea, for example, was a drug very little used in\nEurope, before the middle of the last century. At present, the value of\nthe tea annually imported by the English East India company, for the use\nof their own countrymen, amounts to more than a million and a half a year;\nand even this is not enough; a great deal more being constantly smuggled\ninto the country from the ports of Holland, from Gottenburgh in Sweden,\nand from the coast of France, too, as long as the French East India\ncompany was in prosperity. The consumption of the porcelain of China, of\nthe spiceries of the Moluccas, of the piece goods of Bengal, and of\ninnumerable other articles, has increased very nearly in a like\nproportion. The tonnage, accordingly, of all the European shipping\nemployed in the East India trade, at any one time during the last century,\nwas not, perhaps, much greater than that of the English East India company\nbefore the late reduction of their shipping.\nBut in the East Indies, particularly in China and Indostan, the value of\nthe precious metals, when the Europeans first began to trade to those\ncountries, was much higher than in Europe; and it still continues to be\nso. In rice countries, which generally yield two, sometimes three crops in\nthe year, each of them more plentiful than any common crop of corn, the\nabundance of food must be much greater than in any corn country of equal\nextent. Such countries are accordingly much more populous. In them, too,\nthe rich, having a greater superabundance of food to dispose of beyond\nwhat they themselves can consume, have the means of purchasing a much\ngreater quantity of the labour of other people. The retinue of a grandee\nin China or Indostan accordingly is, by all accounts, much more numerous\nand splendid than that of the richest subjects in Europe. The same\nsuperabundance of food, of which they have the disposal, enables them to\ngive a greater quantity of it for all those singular and rare productions\nwhich nature furnishes but in very small quantities; such as the precious\nmetals and the precious stones, the great objects of the competition of\nthe rich. Though the mines, therefore, which supplied the Indian market,\nhad been as abundant as those which supplied the European, such\ncommodities would naturally exchange for a greater quantity of food in\nIndia than in Europe. But the mines which supplied the Indian market with\nthe precious metals seem to have been a good deal less abundant, and those\nwhich supplied it with the precious stones a good deal more so, than the\nmines which supplied the European. The precious metals, therefore, would\nnaturally exchange in India for a somewhat greater quantity of the\nprecious stones, and for a much greater quantity of food than in Europe.\nThe money price of diamonds, the greatest of all superfluities, would be\nsomewhat lower, and that of food, the first of all necessaries, a great\ndeal lower in the one country than in the other. But the real price of\nlabour, the real quantity of the necessaries of life which is given to the\nlabourer, it has already been observed, is lower both in China and\nIndostan, the two great markets of India, than it is through the greater\npart of Europe. The wages of the labourer will there purchase a smaller\nquantity of food: and as the money price of food is much lower in India\nthan in Europe, the money price of labour is there lower upon a double\naccount; upon account both of the small quantity of food which it will\npurchase, and of the low price of that food. But in countries of equal art\nand industry, the money price of the greater part of manufactures will be\nin proportion to the money price of labour; and in manufacturing art and\nindustry, China and Indostan, though inferior, seem not to be much\ninferior to any part of Europe. The money price of the greater part of\nmanufactures, therefore, will naturally be much lower in those great\nempires than it is anywhere in Europe. Through the greater part of Europe,\ntoo, the expense of land-carriage increases very much both the real and\nnominal price of most manufactures. It costs more labour, and therefore\nmore money, to bring first the materials, and afterwards the complete\nmanufacture to market. In China and Indostan, the extent and variety of\ninland navigations save the greater part of this labour, and consequently\nof this money, and thereby reduce still lower both the real and the\nnominal price of the greater part of their manufactures. Upon all these\naccounts, the precious metals are a commodity which it always has been,\nand still continues to be, extremely advantageous to carry from Europe to\nIndia. There is scarce any commodity which brings a better price there; or\nwhich, in proportion to the quantity of labour and commodities which it\ncosts in Europe, will purchase or command a greater quantity of labour and\ncommodities in India. It is more advantageous, too, to carry silver\nthither than gold; because in China, and the greater part of the other\nmarkets of India, the proportion between fine silver and fine gold is but\nas ten, or at most as twelve to one; whereas in Europe it is as fourteen\nor fifteen to one. In China, and the greater part of the other markets of\nIndia, ten, or at most twelve ounces of silver, will purchase an ounce of\ngold; in Europe, it requires from fourteen to fifteen ounces. In the\ncargoes, therefore, of the greater part of European ships which sail to\nIndia, silver has generally been one of the most valuable articles. It is\nthe most valuable article in the Acapulco ships which sail to Manilla. The\nsilver of the new continent seems, in this manner, to be one of the\nprincipal commodities by which the commerce between the two extremities of\nthe old one is carried on; and it is by means of it, in a great measure,\nthat those distant parts of the world are connected with one another.\nIn order to supply so very widely extended a market, the quantity of\nsilver annually brought from the mines must not only be sufficient to\nsupport that continued increase, both of coin and of plate, which is\nrequired in all thriving countries; but to repair that continual waste and\nconsumption of silver which takes place in all countries where that metal\nis used.\nThe continual consumption of the precious metals in coin by wearing, and\nin plate both by wearing and cleaning, is very sensible; and in\ncommodities of which the use is so very widely extended, would alone\nrequire a very great annual supply. The consumption of those metals in\nsome particular manufactures, though it may not perhaps be greater upon\nthe whole than this gradual consumption, is, however, much more sensible,\nas it is much more rapid. In the manufactures of Birmingham alone, the\nquantity of gold and silver annually employed in gilding and plating, and\nthereby disqualified from ever afterwards appearing in the shape of those\nmetals, is said to amount to more than fifty thousand pounds sterling. We\nmay from thence form some notion how great must be the annual consumption\nin all the different parts of the world, either in manufactures of the\nsame kind with those of Birmingham, or in laces, embroideries, gold and\nsilver stuffs, the gilding of books, furniture, etc. A considerable\nquantity, too, must be annually lost in transporting those metals from one\nplace to another both by sea and by land. In the greater part of the\ngovernments of Asia, besides, the almost universal custom of concealing\ntreasures in the bowels of the earth, of which the knowledge frequently\ndies with the person who makes the concealment, must occasion the loss of\na still greater quantity.\nThe quantity of gold and silver imported at both Cadiz and Lisbon\n(including not only what comes under register, but what may be supposed to\nbe smuggled) amounts, according to the best accounts, to about six\nmillions sterling a-year.\nAccording to Mr Meggens {Postscript to the Universal Merchant p. 15 and\n16. This postscript was not printed till 1756, three years after the\npublication of the book, which has never had a second edition. The\npostscript is, therefore, to be found in few copies; it corrects several\nerrors in the book.}, the annual importation of the precious metals into\nSpain, at an average of six years, viz. from 1748 to 1753, both inclusive,\nand into Portugal, at an average of seven years, viz. from 1747 to 1753,\nboth inclusive, amounted in silver to 1,101,107 pounds weight, and in gold\nto 49,940 pounds weight. The silver, at sixty two shillings the pound\ntroy, amounts to \u00a3 3,413,431:10s. sterling. The gold, at forty-four\nguineas and a half the pound troy, amounts to \u00a3 2,333,446:14s. sterling.\nBoth together amount to \u00a3 5,746,878:4s. sterling. The account of what was\nimported under register, he assures us, is exact. He gives us the detail\nof the particular places from which the gold and silver were brought, and\nof the particular quantity of each metal, which, according to the\nregister, each of them afforded. He makes an allowance, too, for the\nquantity of each metal which, he supposes, may have been smuggled. The\ngreat experience of this judicious merchant renders his opinion of\nconsiderable weight.\nAccording to the eloquent, and sometimes well-informed, author of the\nPhilosophical and Political History of the Establishment of the Europeans\nin the two Indies, the annual importation of registered gold and silver\ninto Spain, at an average of eleven years, viz. from 1754 to 1764, both\ninclusive, amounted to 13,984,185 \u2157 piastres of ten reals. On account of\nwhat may have been smuggled, however, the whole annual importation, he\nsupposes, may have amounted to seventeen millions of piastres, which, at\n4s. 6d. the piastre, is equal to \u00a3 3,825,000 sterling. He gives the\ndetail, too, of the particular places from which the gold and silver were\nbrought, and of the particular quantities of each metal, which according\nto the register, each of them afforded. He informs us, too, that if we\nwere to judge of the quantity of gold annually imported from the Brazils\nto Lisbon, by the amount of the tax paid to the king of Portugal, which it\nseems, is one-fifth of the standard metal, we might value it at eighteen\nmillions of cruzadoes, or forty-five millions of French livres, equal to\nabout twenty millions sterling. On account of what may have been smuggled,\nhowever, we may safely, he says, add to this sum an eighth more, or \u00a3\n250,000 sterling, so that the whole will amount to \u00a3 2,250,000 sterling.\nAccording to this account, therefore, the whole annual importation of the\nprecious metals into both Spain and Portugal, mounts to about \u00a3 6,075,000\nsterling.\nSeveral other very well authenticated, though manuscript accounts, I have\nbeen assured, agree in making this whole annual importation amount, at an\naverage, to about six millions sterling; sometimes a little more,\nsometimes a little less.\nThe annual importation of the precious metals into Cadiz and Lisbon,\nindeed, is not equal to the whole annual produce of the mines of America.\nSome part is sent annually by the Acapulco ships to Manilla; some part is\nemployed in a contraband trade, which the Spanish colonies carry on with\nthose of other European nations; and some part, no doubt, remains in the\ncountry. The mines of America, besides, are by no means the only gold and\nsilver mines in the world. They, are, however, by far the most abundant.\nThe produce of all the other mines which are known is insignificant, it is\nacknowledged, in comparison with theirs; and the far greater part of\ntheir produce, it is likewise acknowledged, is annually imported into\nCadiz and Lisbon. But the consumption of Birmingham alone, at the rate of\nfifty thousand pounds a-year, is equal to the hundred-and-twentieth part\nof this annual importation, at the rate of six millions a-year. The whole\nannual consumption of gold and silver, therefore, in all the different\ncountries of the world where those metals are used, may, perhaps, be\nnearly equal to the whole annual produce. The remainder may be no more\nthan sufficient to supply the increasing demand of all thriving countries.\nIt may even have fallen so far short of this demand, as somewhat to raise\nthe price of those metals in the European market.\nThe quantity of brass and iron annually brought from the mine to the\nmarket, is out of all proportion greater than that of gold and silver. We\ndo not, however, upon this account, imagine that those coarse metals are\nlikely to multiply beyond the demand, or to become gradually cheaper and\ncheaper. Why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do\nso? The coarse metals, indeed, though harder, are put to much harder uses,\nand, as they are of less value, less care is employed in their\npreservation. The precious metals, however, are not necessarily immortal\nany more than they, but are liable, too, to be lost, wasted, and consumed,\nin a great variety of ways.\nThe price of all metals, though liable to slow and gradual variations,\nvaries less from year to year than that of almost any other part of the\nrude produce of land: and the price of the precious metals is even less\nliable to sudden variations than that of the coarse ones. The durableness\nof metals is the foundation of this extraordinary steadiness of price. The\ncorn which was brought to market last year will be all, or almost all,\nconsumed, long before the end of this year. But some part of the iron\nwhich was brought from the mine two or three hundred years ago, may be\nstill in use, and, perhaps, some part of the gold which was brought from\nit two or three thousand years ago. The different masses of corn, which,\nin different years, must supply the consumption of the world, will always\nbe nearly in proportion to the respective produce of those different\nyears. But the proportion between the different masses of iron which may\nbe in use in two different years, will be very little affected by any\naccidental difference in the produce of the iron mines of those two years;\nand the proportion between the masses of gold will be still less affected\nby any such difference in the produce of the gold mines. Though the\nproduce of the greater part of metallic mines, therefore, varies, perhaps,\nstill more from year to year than that of the greater part of corn fields,\nthose variations have not the same effect upon the price of the one\nspecies of commodities as upon that of the other.\n_Variations in the Proportion between the respective Values of Gold and\nSilver._\nBefore the discovery of the mines of America, the value of fine gold to\nfine silver was regulated in the different mines of Europe, between the\nproportions of one to ten and one to twelve; that is, an ounce of fine\ngold was supposed to be worth from ten to twelve ounces of fine silver.\nAbout the middle of the last century, it came to be regulated, between the\nproportions of one to fourteen and one to fifteen; that is, an ounce of\nfine gold came to be supposed worth between fourteen and fifteen ounces of\nfine silver. Gold rose in its nominal value, or in the quantity of silver\nwhich was given for it. Both metals sunk in their real value, or in the\nquantity of labour which they could purchase; but silver sunk more than\ngold. Though both the gold and silver mines of America exceeded in\nfertility all those which had ever been known before, the fertility of the\nsilver mines had, it seems, been proportionally still greater than that of\nthe gold ones.\nThe great quantities of silver carried annually from Europe to India,\nhave, in some of the English settlements, gradually reduced the value of\nthat metal in proportion to gold. In the mint of Calcutta, an ounce of\nfine gold is supposed to be worth fifteen ounces of fine silver, in the\nsame manner as in Europe. It is in the mint, perhaps, rated too high for\nthe value which it bears in the market of Bengal. In China, the proportion\nof gold to silver still continues as one to ten, or one to twelve. In\nJapan, it is said to be as one to eight.\nThe proportion between the quantities of gold and silver annually imported\ninto Europe, according to Mr Meggens\u2019 account, is as one to twenty-two\nnearly; that is, for one ounce of gold there are imported a little more\nthan twenty-two ounces of silver. The great quantity of silver sent\nannually to the East Indies reduces, he supposes, the quantities of those\nmetals which remain in Europe to the proportion of one to fourteen or\nfifteen, the proportion of their values. The proportion between their\nvalues, he seems to think, must necessarily be the same as that between\ntheir quantities, and would therefore be as one to twenty-two, were it not\nfor this greater exportation of silver.\nBut the ordinary proportion between the respective values of two\ncommodities is not necessarily the same as that between the quantities of\nthem which are commonly in the market. The price of an ox, reckoned at ten\nguineas, is about three score times the price of a lamb, reckoned at 3s.\n6d. It would be absurd, however, to infer from thence, that there are\ncommonly in the market three score lambs for one ox; and it would be just\nas absurd to infer, because an ounce of gold will commonly purchase from\nfourteen or fifteen ounces of silver, that there are commonly in the\nmarket only fourteen or fifteen ounces of silver for one ounce of gold.\nThe quantity of silver commonly in the market, it is probable, is much\ngreater in proportion to that of gold, than the value of a certain\nquantity of gold is to that of an equal quantity of silver. The whole\nquantity of a cheap commodity brought to market is commonly not only\ngreater, but of greater value, than the whole quantity of a dear one. The\nwhole quantity of bread annually brought to market, is not only greater,\nbut of greater value, than the whole quantity of butcher\u2019s meat; the whole\nquantity of butcher\u2019s meat, than the whole quantity of poultry; and the\nwhole quantity of poultry, than the whole quantity of wild fowl. There are\nso many more purchasers for the cheap than for the dear commodity, that,\nnot only a greater quantity of it, but a greater value can commonly be\ndisposed of. The whole quantity, therefore, of the cheap commodity, must\ncommonly be greater in proportion to the whole quantity of the dear one,\nthan the value of a certain quantity of the dear one, is to the value of\nan equal quantity of the cheap one. When we compare the precious metals\nwith one another, silver is a cheap, and gold a dear commodity. We ought\nnaturally to expect, therefore, that there should always be in the market,\nnot only a greater quantity, but a greater value of silver than of gold.\nLet any man, who has a little of both, compare his own silver with his\ngold plate, and he will probably find, that not only the quantity, but the\nvalue of the former, greatly exceeds that of the latter. Many people,\nbesides, have a good deal of silver who have no gold plate, which, even\nwith those who have it, is generally confined to watch-cases, snuff-boxes,\nand such like trinkets, of which the whole amount is seldom of great\nvalue. In the British coin, indeed, the value of the gold preponderates\ngreatly, but it is not so in that of all countries. In the coin of some\ncountries, the value of the two metals is nearly equal. In the Scotch\ncoin, before the union with England, the gold preponderated very little,\nthough it did somewhat {See Ruddiman\u2019s Preface to Anderson\u2019s Diplomata,\netc. Scotiae.}, as it appears by the accounts of the mint. In the coin of\nmany countries the silver preponderates. In France, the largest sums are\ncommonly paid in that metal, and it is there difficult to get more gold\nthan what is necessary to carry about in your pocket. The superior value,\nhowever, of the silver plate above that of the gold, which takes place in\nall countries, will much more than compensate the preponderancy of the\ngold coin above the silver, which takes place only in some countries.\nThough, in one sense of the word, silver always has been, and probably\nalways will be, much cheaper than gold; yet, in another sense, gold may\nperhaps, in the present state of the Spanish market, be said to be\nsomewhat cheaper than silver. A commodity may be said to be dear or cheap\nnot only according to the absolute greatness or smallness of its usual\nprice, but according as that price is more or less above the lowest for\nwhich it is possible to bring it to market for any considerable time\ntogether. This lowest price is that which barely replaces, with a moderate\nprofit, the stock which must be employed in bringing the commodity\nthither. It is the price which affords nothing to the landlord, of which\nrent makes not any component part, but which resolves itself altogether\ninto wages and profit. But, in the present state of the Spanish market,\ngold is certainly somewhat nearer to this lowest price than silver. The\ntax of the king of Spain upon gold is only one-twentieth part of the\nstandard metal, or five per cent.; whereas his tax upon silver amounts to\none-tenth part of it, or to ten per cent. In these taxes, too, it has\nalready been observed, consists the whole rent of the greater part of the\ngold and silver mines of Spanish America; and that upon gold is still\nworse paid than that upon silver. The profits of the undertakers of gold\nmines, too, as they more rarely make a fortune, must, in general, be still\nmore moderate than those of the undertakers of silver mines. The price of\nSpanish gold, therefore, as it affords both less rent and less profit,\nmust, in the Spanish market, be somewhat nearer to the lowest price for\nwhich it is possible to bring it thither, than the price of Spanish\nsilver. When all expenses are computed, the whole quantity of the one\nmetal, it would seem, cannot, in the Spanish market, be disposed of so\nadvantageously as the whole quantity of the other. The tax, indeed, of the\nking of Portugal upon the gold of the Brazils, is the same with the\nancient tax of the king of Spain upon the silver of Mexico and Peru; or\none-fifth part of the standard metal. It may therefore be uncertain,\nwhether, to the general market of Europe, the whole mass of American gold\ncomes at a price nearer to the lowest for which it is possible to bring it\nthither, than the whole mass of American silver.\nThe price of diamonds and other precious stones may, perhaps, be still\nnearer to the lowest price at which it is possible to bring them to\nmarket, than even the price of gold.\nThough it is not very probable that any part of a tax, which is not only\nimposed upon one of the most proper subjects of taxation, a mere luxury\nand superfluity, but which affords so very important a revenue as the tax\nupon silver, will ever be given up as long as it is possible to pay it;\nyet the same impossibility of paying it, which, in 1736. made it necessary\nto reduce it from one-fifth to one-tenth, may in time make it necessary to\nreduce it still further; in the same manner as it made it necessary to\nreduce the tax upon gold to one-twentieth. That the silver mines of\nSpanish America, like all other mines, become gradually more expensive in\nthe working, on account of the greater depths at which it is necessary to\ncarry on the works, and of the greater expense of drawing out the water,\nand of supplying them with fresh air at those depths, is acknowledged by\neverybody who has inquired into the state of those mines.\nThese causes, which are equivalent to a growing scarcity of silver (for a\ncommodity may be said to grow scarcer when it becomes more difficult and\nexpensive to collect a certain quantity of it), must, in time, produce one\nor other of the three following events: The increase of the expense must\neither, first, be compensated altogether by a proportionable increase in\nthe price of the metal; or, secondly, it must be compensated altogether by\na proportionable diminution of the tax upon silver; or, thirdly, it must\nbe compensated partly by the one and partly by the other of those two\nexpedients. This third event is very possible. As gold rose in its price\nin proportion to silver, notwithstanding a great diminution of the tax\nupon gold, so silver might rise in its price in proportion to labour and\ncommodities, notwithstanding an equal diminution of the tax upon silver.\nSuch successive reductions of the tax, however, though they may not\nprevent altogether, must certainly retard, more or less, the rise of the\nvalue of silver in the European market. In consequence of such reductions,\nmany mines may be wrought which could not be wrought before, because they\ncould not afford to pay the old tax; and the quantity of silver annually\nbrought to market, must always be somewhat greater, and, therefore, the\nvalue of any given quantity somewhat less, than it otherwise would have\nbeen. In consequence of the reduction in 1736, the value of silver in the\nEuropean market, though it may not at this day be lower than before that\nreduction, is, probably, at least ten per cent. lower than it would have\nbeen, had the court of Spain continued to exact the old tax. That,\nnotwithstanding this reduction, the value of silver has, during the course\nof the present century, begun to rise somewhat in the European market, the\nfacts and arguments which have been alleged above, dispose me to believe,\nor more properly to suspect and conjecture; for the best opinion which I\ncan form upon this subject, scarce, perhaps, deserves the name of belief.\nThe rise, indeed, supposing there has been any, has hitherto been so very\nsmall, that after all that has been said, it may, perhaps, appear to many\npeople uncertain, not only whether this event has actually taken place,\nbut whether the contrary may not have taken place, or whether the value of\nsilver may not still continue to fall in the European market.\nIt must be observed, however, that whatever may be the supposed annual\nimportation of gold and silver, there must be a certain period at which\nthe annual consumption of those metals will be equal to that annual\nimportation. Their consumption must increase as their mass increases, or\nrather in a much greater proportion. As their mass increases, their value\ndiminishes. They are more used, and less cared for, and their consumption\nconsequently increases in a greater proportion than their mass. After a\ncertain period, therefore, the annual consumption of those metals must, in\nthis manner, become equal to their annual importation, provided that\nimportation is not continually increasing; which, in the present times, is\nnot supposed to be the case.\nIf, when the annual consumption has become equal to the annual\nimportation, the annual importation should gradually diminish, the annual\nconsumption may, for some time, exceed the annual importation. The mass of\nthose metals may gradually and insensibly diminish, and their value\ngradually and insensibly rise, till the annual importation becoming again\nstationary, the annual consumption will gradually and insensibly\naccommodate itself to what that annual importation can maintain.\n_Grounds of the suspicion that the Value of Silver still continues to\ndecrease._\nThe increase of the wealth of Europe, and the popular notion, that as the\nquantity of the precious metals naturally increases with the increase of\nwealth, so their value diminishes as their quantity increases, may,\nperhaps, dispose many people to believe that their value still continues\nto fall in the European market; and the still gradually increasing price\nof many parts of the rude produce of land may confirm them still farther\nin this opinion.\nThat that increase in the quantity of the precious metals, which arises in\nany country from the increase of wealth, has no tendency to diminish their\nvalue, I have endeavoured to shew already. Gold and silver naturally\nresort to a rich country, for the same reason that all sorts of luxuries\nand curiosities resort to it; not because they are cheaper there than in\npoorer countries, but because they are dearer, or because a better price\nis given for them. It is the superiority of price which attracts them; and\nas soon as that superiority ceases, they necessarily cease to go thither.\nIf you except corn, and such other vegetables as are raised altogether by\nhuman industry, that all other sorts of rude produce, cattle, poultry,\ngame of all kinds, the useful fossils and minerals of the earth, etc.\nnaturally grow dearer, as the society advances in wealth and improvement,\nI have endeavoured to shew already. Though such commodities, therefore,\ncome to exchange for a greater quantity of silver than before, it will not\nfrom thence follow that silver has become really cheaper, or will purchase\nless labour than before; but that such commodities have become really\ndearer, or will purchase more labour than before. It is not their nominal\nprice only, but their real price, which rises in the progress of\nimprovement. The rise of their nominal price is the effect, not of any\ndegradation of the value of silver, but of the rise in their real price.\n_Different Effects of the Progress of Improvement upon three different\nsorts of rude Produce._\nThese different sorts of rude produce may be divided into three classes.\nThe first comprehends those which it is scarce in the power of human\nindustry to multiply at all. The second, those which it can multiply in\nproportion to the demand. The third, those in which the efficacy of\nindustry is either limited or uncertain. In the progress of wealth and\nimprovement, the real price of the first may rise to any degree of\nextravagance, and seems not to be limited by any certain boundary. That of\nthe second, though it may rise greatly, has, however, a certain boundary,\nbeyond which it cannot well pass for any considerable time together. That\nof the third, though its natural tendency is to rise in the progress of\nimprovement, yet in the same degree of improvement it may sometimes happen\neven to fall, sometimes to continue the same, and sometimes to rise more\nor less, according as different accidents render the efforts of human\nindustry, in multiplying this sort of rude produce, more or less\nsuccessful.\nFirst Sort.\u2014The first sort of rude produce, of which the price rises\nin the progress of improvement, is that which it is scarce in the power of\nhuman industry to multiply at all. It consists in those things which\nnature produces only in certain quantities, and which being of a very\nperishable nature, it is impossible to accumulate together the produce of\nmany different seasons. Such are the greater part of rare and singular\nbirds and fishes, many different sorts of game, almost all wild-fowl, all\nbirds of passage in particular, as well as many other things. When wealth,\nand the luxury which accompanies it, increase, the demand for these is\nlikely to increase with them, and no effort of human industry may be able\nto increase the supply much beyond what it was before this increase of the\ndemand. The quantity of such commodities, therefore, remaining the same,\nor nearly the same, while the competition to purchase them is continually\nincreasing, their price may rise to any degree of extravagance, and seems\nnot to be limited by any certain boundary. If woodcocks should become so\nfashionable as to sell for twenty guineas a-piece, no effort of human\nindustry could increase the number of those brought to market, much beyond\nwhat it is at present. The high price paid by the Romans, in the time of\ntheir greatest grandeur, for rare birds and fishes, may in this manner\neasily be accounted for. These prices were not the effects of the low\nvalue of silver in those times, but of the high value of such rarities and\ncuriosities as human industry could not multiply at pleasure. The real\nvalue of silver was higher at Rome, for sometime before, and after the\nfall of the republic, than it is through the greater part of Europe at\npresent. Three sestertii equal to about sixpence sterling, was the price\nwhich the republic paid for the modius or peck of the tithe wheat of\nSicily. This price, however, was probably below the average market price,\nthe obligation to deliver their wheat at this rate being considered as a\ntax upon the Sicilian farmers. When the Romans, therefore, had occasion to\norder more corn than the tithe of wheat amounted to, they were bound by\ncapitulation to pay for the surplus at the rate of four sestertii, or\neightpence sterling the peck; and this had probably been reckoned the\nmoderate and reasonable, that is, the ordinary or average contract price\nof those times; it is equal to about one-and-twenty shillings the quarter.\nEight-and-twenty shillings the quarter was, before the late years of\nscarcity, the ordinary contract price of English wheat, which in quality\nis inferior to the Sicilian, and generally sells for a lower price in the\nEuropean market. The value of silver, therefore, in those ancient times,\nmust have been to its value in the present, as three to four inversely;\nthat is, three ounces of silver would then have purchased the same\nquantity of labour and commodities which four ounces will do at present.\nWhen we read in Pliny, therefore, that Seius {Lib. X, c. 29.} bought a\nwhite nightingale, as a present for the empress Agrippina, at the price of\nsix thousand sestertii, equal to about fifty pounds of our present money;\nand that Asinius Celer {Lib. IX, c. 17.} purchased a surmullet at the\nprice of eight thousand sestertii, equal to about sixty-six pounds\nthirteen shillings and fourpence of our present money; the extravagance of\nthose prices, how much soever it may surprise us, is apt, notwithstanding,\nto appear to us about one third less than it really was. Their real price,\nthe quantity of labour and subsistence which was given away for them, was\nabout one-third more than their nominal price is apt to express to us in\nthe present times. Seius gave for the nightingale the command of a\nquantity of labour and subsistence, equal to what \u00a3 66:13: 4d. would\npurchase in the present times; and Asinius Celer gave for a surmullet the\ncommand of a quantity equal to what \u00a3 88:17: 9d. would purchase. What\noccasioned the extravagance of those high prices was, not so much the\nabundance of silver, as the abundance of labour and subsistence, of which\nthose Romans had the disposal, beyond what was necessary for their own\nuse. The quantity of silver, of which they had the disposal, was a good\ndeal less than what the command of the same quantity of labour and\nsubsistence would have procured to them in the present times.\nSecond sort.\u2014The second sort of rude produce, of which the price\nrises in the progress of improvement, is that which human industry can\nmultiply in proportion to the demand. It consists in those useful plants\nand animals, which, in uncultivated countries, nature produces with such\nprofuse abundance, that they are of little or no value, and which, as\ncultivation advances, are therefore forced to give place to some more\nprofitable produce. During a long period in the progress of improvement,\nthe quantity of these is continually diminishing, while, at the same time,\nthe demand for them is continually increasing. Their real value,\ntherefore, the real quantity of labour which they will purchase or\ncommand, gradually rises, till at last it gets so high as to render them\nas profitable a produce as any thing else which human industry can raise\nupon the most fertile and best cultivated land. When it has got so high,\nit cannot well go higher. If it did, more land and more industry would\nsoon be employed to increase their quantity.\nWhen the price of cattle, for example, rises so high, that it is as\nprofitable to cultivate land in order to raise food for them as in order\nto raise food for man, it cannot well go higher. If it did, more corn land\nwould soon be turned into pasture. The extension of tillage, by\ndiminishing the quantity of wild pasture, diminishes the quantity of\nbutcher\u2019s meat, which the country naturally produces without labour or\ncultivation; and, by increasing the number of those who have either corn,\nor, what comes to the same thing, the price of corn, to give in exchange\nfor it, increases the demand. The price of butcher\u2019s meat, therefore, and,\nconsequently, of cattle, must gradually rise, till it gets so high, that\nit becomes as profitable to employ the most fertile and best cultivated\nlands in raising food for them as in raising corn. But it must always be\nlate in the progress of improvement before tillage can be so far extended\nas to raise the price of cattle to this height; and, till it has got to\nthis height, if the country is advancing at all, their price must be\ncontinually rising. There are, perhaps, some parts of Europe in which the\nprice of cattle has not yet got to this height. It had not got to this\nheight in any part of Scotland before the Union. Had the Scotch cattle\nbeen always confined to the market of Scotland, in a country in which the\nquantity of land, which can be applied to no other purpose but the feeding\nof cattle, is so great in proportion to what can be applied to other\npurposes, it is scarce possible, perhaps, that their price could ever have\nrisen so high as to render it profitable to cultivate land for the sake of\nfeeding them. In England, the price of cattle, it has already been\nobserved, seems, in the neighbourhood of London, to have got to this\nheight about the beginning of the last century; but it was much later,\nprobably, before it got through the greater part of the remoter counties,\nin some of which, perhaps, it may scarce yet have got to it. Of all the\ndifferent substances, however, which compose this second sort of rude\nproduce, cattle is, perhaps, that of which the price, in the progress of\nimprovement, rises first to this height.\nTill the price of cattle, indeed, has got to this height, it seems scarce\npossible that the greater part, even of those lands which are capable of\nthe highest cultivation, can be completely cultivated. In all farms too\ndistant from any town to carry manure from it, that is, in the far greater\npart of those of every extensive country, the quantity of well cultivated\nland must be in proportion to the quantity of manure which the farm itself\nproduces; and this, again, must be in proportion to the stock of cattle\nwhich are maintained upon it. The land is manured, either by pasturing the\ncattle upon it, or by feeding them in the stable, and from thence carrying\nout their dung to it. But unless the price of the cattle be sufficient to\npay both the rent and profit of cultivated land, the farmer cannot afford\nto pasture them upon it; and he can still less afford to feed them in the\nstable. It is with the produce of improved and cultivated land only that\ncattle can be fed in the stable; because, to collect the scanty and\nscattered produce of waste and unimproved lands, would require too much\nlabour, and be too expensive. If the price of the cattle, therefore, is\nnot sufficient to pay for the produce of improved and cultivated land,\nwhen they are allowed to pasture it, that price will be still less\nsufficient to pay for that produce, when it must be collected with a good\ndeal of additional labour, and brought into the stable to them. In these\ncircumstances, therefore, no more cattle can with profit be fed in the\nstable than what are necessary for tillage. But these can never afford\nmanure enough for keeping constantly in good condition all the lands which\nthey are capable of cultivating. What they afford, being insufficient for\nthe whole farm, will naturally be reserved for the lands to which it can\nbe most advantageously or conveniently applied; the most fertile, or\nthose, perhaps, in the neighbourhood of the farm-yard. These, therefore,\nwill be kept constantly in good condition, and fit for tillage. The rest\nwill, the greater part of them, be allowed to lie waste, producing scarce\nany thing but some miserable pasture, just sufficient to keep alive a few\nstraggling, half-starved cattle; the farm, though much overstocked in\nproportion to what would be necessary for its complete cultivation, being\nvery frequently overstocked in proportion to its actual produce. A portion\nof this waste land, however, after having been pastured in this wretched\nmanner for six or seven years together, may be ploughed up, when it will\nyield, perhaps, a poor crop or two of bad oats, or of some other coarse\ngrain; and then, being entirely exhausted, it must be rested and pastured\nagain as before, and another portion ploughed up, to be in the same manner\nexhausted and rested again in its turn. Such, accordingly, was the general\nsystem of management all over the low country of Scotland before the\nUnion. The lands which were kept constantly well manured and in good\ncondition seldom exceeded a third or fourth part of the whole farm, and\nsometimes did not amount to a fifth or a sixth part of it. The rest were\nnever manured, but a certain portion of them was in its turn,\nnotwithstanding, regularly cultivated and exhausted. Under this system of\nmanagement, it is evident, even that part of the lands of Scotland which\nis capable of good cultivation, could produce but little in comparison of\nwhat it may be capable of producing. But how disadvantageous soever this\nsystem may appear, yet, before the Union, the low price of cattle seems to\nhave rendered it almost unavoidable. If, notwithstanding a great rise in\nthe price, it still continues to prevail through a considerable part of\nthe country, it is owing in many places, no doubt, to ignorance and\nattachment to old customs, but, in most places, to the unavoidable\nobstructions which the natural course of things opposes to the immediate\nor speedy establishment of a better system: first, to the poverty of the\ntenants, to their not having yet had time to acquire a stock of cattle\nsufficient to cultivate their lands more completely, the same rise of\nprice, which would render it advantageous for them to maintain a greater\nstock, rendering it more difficult for them to acquire it; and, secondly,\nto their not having yet had time to put their lands in condition to\nmaintain this greater stock properly, supposing they were capable of\nacquiring it. The increase of stock and the improvement of land are two\nevents which must go hand in hand, and of which the one can nowhere much\noutrun the other. Without some increase of stock, there can be scarce any\nimprovement of land, but there can be no considerable increase of stock,\nbut in consequence of a considerable improvement of land; because\notherwise the land could not maintain it. These natural obstructions to\nthe establishment of a better system, cannot be removed but by a long\ncourse of frugality and industry; and half a century or a century more,\nperhaps, must pass away before the old system, which is wearing out\ngradually, can be completely abolished through all the different parts of\nthe country. Of all the commercial advantages, however, which Scotland has\nderived from the Union with England, this rise in the price of cattle is,\nperhaps, the greatest. It has not only raised the value of all highland\nestates, but it has, perhaps, been the principal cause of the improvement\nof the low country.\nIn all new colonies, the great quantity of waste land, which can for many\nyears be applied to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle, soon\nrenders them extremely abundant; and in every thing great cheapness is the\nnecessary consequence of great abundance. Though all the cattle of the\nEuropean colonies in America were originally carried from Europe, they\nsoon multiplied so much there, and became of so little value, that even\nhorses were allowed to run wild in the woods, without any owner thinking\nit worth while to claim them. It must be a long time after the first\nestablishment of such colonies, before it can become profitable to feed\ncattle upon the produce of cultivated land. The same causes, therefore,\nthe want of manure, and the disproportion between the stock employed in\ncultivation and the land which it is destined to cultivate, are likely to\nintroduce there a system of husbandry, not unlike that which still\ncontinues to take place in so many parts of Scotland. Mr Kalm, the Swedish\ntraveller, when he gives an account of the husbandry of some of the\nEnglish colonies in North America, as he found it in 1749, observes,\naccordingly, that he can with difficulty discover there the character of\nthe English nation, so well skilled in all the different branches of\nagriculture. They make scarce any manure for their corn fields, he says;\nbut when one piece of ground has been exhausted by continual cropping,\nthey clear and cultivate another piece of fresh land; and when that is\nexhausted, proceed to a third. Their cattle are allowed to wander through\nthe woods and other uncultivated grounds, where they are half-starved;\nhaving long ago extirpated almost all the annual grasses, by cropping them\ntoo early in the spring, before they had time to form their flowers, or to\nshed their seeds. {Kalm\u2019s Travels, vol 1, pp. 343, 344.} The annual\ngrasses were, it seems, the best natural grasses in that part of North\nAmerica; and when the Europeans first settled there, they used to grow\nvery thick, and to rise three or four feet high. A piece of ground which,\nwhen he wrote, could not maintain one cow, would in former times, he was\nassured, have maintained four, each of which would have given four times\nthe quantity of milk which that one was capable of giving. The poorness of\nthe pasture had, in his opinion, occasioned the degradation of their\ncattle, which degenerated sensibly from one generation to another. They\nwere probably not unlike that stunted breed which was common all over\nScotland thirty or forty years ago, and which is now so much mended\nthrough the greater part of the low country, not so much by a change of\nthe breed, though that expedient has been employed in some places, as by a\nmore plentiful method of feeding them.\nThough it is late, therefore, in the progress of improvement, before\ncattle can bring such a price as to render it profitable to cultivate land\nfor the sake of feeding them; yet of all the different parts which compose\nthis second sort of rude produce, they are perhaps the first which bring\nthis price; because, till they bring it, it seems impossible that\nimprovement can be brought near even to that degree of perfection to which\nit has arrived in many parts of Europe.\nAs cattle are among the first, so perhaps venison is among the last parts\nof this sort of rude produce which bring this price. The price of venison\nin Great Britain, how extravagant soever it may appear, is not near\nsufficient to compensate the expense of a deer park, as is well known to\nall those who have had any experience in the feeding of deer. If it was\notherwise, the feeding of deer would soon become an article of common\nfarming, in the same manner as the feeding of those small birds, called\nturdi, was among the ancient Romans. Varro and Columella assure us, that\nit was a most profitable article. The fattening of ortolans, birds of\npassage which arrive lean in the country, is said to be so in some parts\nof France. If venison continues in fashion, and the wealth and luxury of\nGreat Britain increase as they have done for some time past, its price may\nvery probably rise still higher than it is at present.\nBetween that period in the progress of improvement, which brings to its\nheight the price of so necessary an article as cattle, and that which\nbrings to it the price of such a superfluity as venison, there is a very\nlong interval, in the course of which many other sorts of rude produce\ngradually arrive at their highest price, some sooner and some later,\naccording to different circumstances.\nThus, in every farm, the offals of the barn and stable will maintain a\ncertain number of poultry. These, as they are fed with what would\notherwise be lost, are a mere save-all; and as they cost the farmer scarce\nany thing, so he can afford to sell them for very little. Almost all that\nhe gets is pure gain, and their price can scarce be so low as to\ndiscourage him from feeding this number. But in countries ill cultivated,\nand therefore but thinly inhabited, the poultry, which are thus raised\nwithout expense, are often fully sufficient to supply the whole demand. In\nthis state of things, therefore, they are often as cheap as butcher\u2019s\nmeat, or any other sort of animal food. But the whole quantity of poultry\nwhich the farm in this manner produces without expense, must always be\nmuch smaller than the whole quantity of butcher\u2019s meat which is reared\nupon it; and in times of wealth and luxury, what is rare, with only nearly\nequal merit, is always preferred to what is common. As wealth and luxury\nincrease, therefore, in consequence of improvement and cultivation, the\nprice of poultry gradually rises above that of butcher\u2019s meat, till at\nlast it gets so high, that it becomes profitable to cultivate land for the\nsake of feeding them. When it has got to this height, it cannot well go\nhigher. If it did, more land would soon be turned to this purpose. In\nseveral provinces of France, the feeding of poultry is considered as a\nvery important article in rural economy, and sufficiently profitable to\nencourage the farmer to raise a considerable quantity of Indian corn and\nbuckwheat for this purpose. A middling farmer will there sometimes have\nfour hundred fowls in his yard. The feeding of poultry seems scarce yet to\nbe generally considered as a matter of so much importance in England. They\nare certainly, however, dearer in England than in France, as England\nreceives considerable supplies from France. In the progress of\nimprovements, the period at which every particular sort of animal food is\ndearest, must naturally be that which immediately precedes the general\npractice of cultivating land for the sake of raising it. For some time\nbefore this practice becomes general, the scarcity must necessarily raise\nthe price. After it has become general, new methods of feeding are\ncommonly fallen upon, which enable the farmer to raise upon the same\nquantity of ground a much greater quantity of that particular sort of\nanimal food. The plenty not only obliges him to sell cheaper, but, in\nconsequence of these improvements, he can afford to sell cheaper; for if\nhe could not afford it, the plenty would not be of long continuance. It\nhas been probably in this manner that the introduction of clover, turnips,\ncarrots, cabbages, etc. has contributed to sink the common price of\nbutcher\u2019s meat in the London market, somewhat below what it was about the\nbeginning of the last century.\nThe hog, that finds his food among ordure, and greedily devours many\nthings rejected by every other useful animal, is, like poultry, originally\nkept as a save-all. As long as the number of such animals, which can thus\nbe reared at little or no expense, is fully sufficient to supply the\ndemand, this sort of butcher\u2019s meat comes to market at a much lower price\nthan any other. But when the demand rises beyond what this quantity can\nsupply, when it becomes necessary to raise food on purpose for feeding and\nfattening hogs, in the same manner as for feeding and fattening other\ncattle, the price necessarily rises, and becomes proportionably either\nhigher or lower than that of other butcher\u2019s meat, according as the nature\nof the country, and the state of its agriculture, happen to render the\nfeeding of hogs more or less expensive than that of other cattle. In\nFrance, according to Mr Buffon, the price of pork is nearly equal to that\nof beef. In most parts of Great Britain it is at present somewhat higher.\nThe great rise in the price both of hogs and poultry, has, in Great\nBritain, been frequently imputed to the diminution of the number of\ncottagers and other small occupiers of land; an event which has in every\npart of Europe been the immediate forerunner of improvement and better\ncultivation, but which at the same time may have contributed to raise the\nprice of those articles, both somewhat sooner and somewhat faster than it\nwould otherwise have risen. As the poorest family can often maintain a cat\nor a dog without any expense, so the poorest occupiers of land can\ncommonly maintain a few poultry, or a sow and a few pigs, at very little.\nThe little offals of their own table, their whey, skimmed milk, and butter\nmilk, supply those animals with a part of their food, and they find the\nrest in the neighbouring fields, without doing any sensible damage to any\nbody. By diminishing the number of those small occupiers, therefore, the\nquantity of this sort of provisions, which is thus produced at little or\nno expense, must certainly have been a good deal diminished, and their\nprice must consequently have been raised both sooner and faster than it\nwould otherwise have risen. Sooner or later, however, in the progress of\nimprovement, it must at any rate have risen to the utmost height to which\nit is capable of rising; or to the price which pays the labour and expense\nof cultivating the land which furnishes them with food, as well as these\nare paid upon the greater part of other cultivated land.\nThe business of the dairy, like the feeding of hogs and poultry, is\noriginally carried on as a save-all. The cattle necessarily kept upon the\nfarm produce more milk than either the rearing of their own young, or the\nconsumption of the farmer\u2019s family requires; and they produce most at one\nparticular season. But of all the productions of land, milk is perhaps the\nmost perishable. In the warm season, when it is most abundant, it will\nscarce keep four-and-twenty hours. The farmer, by making it into fresh\nbutter, stores a small part of it for a week; by making it into salt\nbutter, for a year; and by making it into cheese, he stores a much greater\npart of it for several years. Part of all these is reserved for the use of\nhis own family; the rest goes to market, in order to find the best price\nwhich is to be had, and which can scarce be so low is to discourage him\nfrom sending thither whatever is over and above the use of his own family.\nIf it is very low indeed, he will be likely to manage his dairy in a very\nslovenly and dirty manner, and will scarce, perhaps, think it worth while\nto have a particular room or building on purpose for it, but will suffer\nthe business to be carried on amidst the smoke, filth, and nastiness of\nhis own kitchen, as was the case of almost all the farmers\u2019 dairies in\nScotland thirty or forty years ago, and as is the case of many of them\nstill. The same causes which gradually raise the price of butcher\u2019s meat,\nthe increase of the demand, and, in consequence of the improvement of the\ncountry, the diminution of the quantity which can be fed at little or no\nexpense, raise, in the same manner, that of the produce of the dairy, of\nwhich the price naturally connects with that of butcher\u2019s meat, or with\nthe expense of feeding cattle. The increase of price pays for more labour,\ncare, and cleanliness. The dairy becomes more worthy of the farmer\u2019s\nattention, and the quality of its produce gradually improves. The price at\nlast gets so high, that it becomes worth while to employ some of the most\nfertile and best cultivated lands in feeding cattle merely for the purpose\nof the dairy; and when it has got to this height, it cannot well go\nhigher. If it did, more land would soon be turned to this purpose. It\nseems to have got to this height through the greater part of England,\nwhere much good land is commonly employed in this manner. If you except\nthe neighbourhood of a few considerable towns, it seems not yet to have\ngot to this height anywhere in Scotland, where common farmers seldom\nemploy much good land in raising food for cattle, merely for the purpose\nof the dairy. The price of the produce, though it has risen very\nconsiderably within these few years, is probably still too low to admit of\nit. The inferiority of the quality, indeed, compared with that of the\nproduce of English dairies, is fully equal to that of the price. But this\ninferiority of quality is, perhaps, rather the effect of this lowness of\nprice, than the cause of it. Though the quality was much better, the\ngreater part of what is brought to market could not, I apprehend, in the\npresent circumstances of the country, be disposed of at a much better\nprice; and the present price, it is probable, would not pay the expense of\nthe land and labour necessary for producing a much better quality. Through\nthe greater part of England, notwithstanding the superiority of price, the\ndairy is not reckoned a more profitable employment of land than the\nraising of corn, or the fattening of cattle, the two great objects of\nagriculture. Through the greater part of Scotland, therefore, it cannot\nyet be even so profitable.\nThe lands of no country, it is evident, can ever be completely cultivated\nand improved, till once the price of every produce, which human industry\nis obliged to raise upon them, has got so high as to pay for the expense\nof complete improvement and cultivation. In order to do this, the price of\neach particular produce must be sufficient, first, to pay the rent of good\ncorn land, as it is that which regulates the rent of the greater part of\nother cultivated land; and, secondly, to pay the labour and expense of the\nfarmer, as well as they are commonly paid upon good corn land; or, in\nother words, to replace with the ordinary profits the stock which he\nemploys about it. This rise in the price of each particular produce; must\nevidently be previous to the improvement and cultivation of the land which\nis destined for raising it. Gain is the end of all improvement; and\nnothing could deserve that name, of which loss was to be the necessary\nconsequence. But loss must be the necessary consequence of improving land\nfor the sake of a produce of which the price could never bring back the\nexpense. If the complete improvement and cultivation of the country be, as\nit most certainly is, the greatest of all public advantages, this rise in\nthe price of all those different sorts of rude produce, instead of being\nconsidered as a public calamity, ought to be regarded as the necessary\nforerunner and attendant of the greatest of all public advantages.\nThis rise, too, in the nominal or money price of all those different sorts\nof rude produce, has been the effect, not of any degradation in the value\nof silver, but of a rise in their real price. They have become worth, not\nonly a greater quantity of silver, but a greater quantity of labour and\nsubsistence than before. As it costs a greater quantity of labour and\nsubsistence to bring them to market, so, when they are brought thither\nthey represent, or are equivalent to a greater quantity.\nThird Sort.\u2014The third and last sort of rude produce, of which the\nprice naturally rises in the progress of improvement, is that in which the\nefficacy of human industry, in augmenting the quantity, is either limited\nor uncertain. Though the real price of this sort of rude produce,\ntherefore, naturally tends to rise in the progress of improvement, yet,\naccording as different accidents happen to render the efforts of human\nindustry more or less successful in augmenting the quantity, it may happen\nsometimes even to fall, sometimes to continue the same, in very different\nperiods of improvement, and sometimes to rise more or less in the same\nperiod.\nThere are some sorts of rude produce which nature has rendered a kind of\nappendages to other sorts; so that the quantity of the one which any\ncountry can afford, is necessarily limited by that of the other. The\nquantity of wool or of raw hides, for example, which any country can\nafford, is necessarily limited by the number of great and small cattle\nthat are kept in it. The state of its improvement, and the nature of its\nagriculture, again necessarily determine this number.\nThe same causes which, in the progress of improvement, gradually raise the\nprice of butcher\u2019s meat, should have the same effect, it may be thought,\nupon the prices of wool and raw hides, and raise them, too, nearly in the\nsame proportion. It probably would be so, if, in the rude beginnings of\nimprovement, the market for the latter commodities was confined within as\nnarrow bounds as that for the former. But the extent of their respective\nmarkets is commonly extremely different.\nThe market for butcher\u2019s meat is almost everywhere confined to the country\nwhich produces it. Ireland, and some part of British America, indeed,\ncarry on a considerable trade in salt provisions; but they are, I believe,\nthe only countries in the commercial world which do so, or which export to\nother countries any considerable part of their butcher\u2019s meat.\nThe market for wool and raw hides, on the contrary, is, in the rude\nbeginnings of improvement, very seldom confined to the country which\nproduces them. They can easily be transported to distant countries; wool\nwithout any preparation, and raw hides with very little; and as they are\nthe materials of many manufactures, the industry of other countries may\noccasion a demand for them, though that of the country which produces them\nmight not occasion any.\nIn countries ill cultivated, and therefore but thinly inhabited, the price\nof the wool and the hide bears always a much greater proportion to that of\nthe whole beast, than in countries where, improvement and population being\nfurther advanced, there is more demand for butcher\u2019s meat. Mr Hume\nobserves, that in the Saxon times, the fleece was estimated at two-fifths\nof the value of the whole sheep and that this was much above the\nproportion of its present estimation. In some provinces of Spain, I have\nbeen assured, the sheep is frequently killed merely for the sake of the\nfleece and the tallow. The carcase is often left to rot upon the ground,\nor to be devoured by beasts and birds of prey. If this sometimes happens\neven in Spain, it happens almost constantly in Chili, at Buenos Ayres, and\nin many other parts of Spanish America, where the horned cattle are almost\nconstantly killed merely for the sake of the hide and the tallow. This,\ntoo, used to happen almost constantly in Hispaniola, while it was infested\nby the buccaneers, and before the settlement, improvement, and\npopulousness of the French plantations ( which now extend round the coast\nof almost the whole western half of the island) had given some value to\nthe cattle of the Spaniards, who still continue to possess, not only the\neastern part of the coast, but the whole inland mountainous part of the\ncountry.\nThough, in the progress of improvement and population, the price of the\nwhole beast necessarily rises, yet the price of the carcase is likely to\nbe much more affected by this rise than that of the wool and the hide. The\nmarket for the carcase being in the rude state of society confined always\nto the country which produces it, must necessarily be extended in\nproportion to the improvement and population of that country. But the\nmarket for the wool and the hides, even of a barbarous country, often\nextending to the whole commercial world, it can very seldom be enlarged in\nthe same proportion. The state of the whole commercial world can seldom be\nmuch affected by the improvement of any particular country; and the market\nfor such commodities may remain the same, or very nearly the same, after\nsuch improvements, as before. It should, however, in the natural course of\nthings, rather, upon the whole, be somewhat extended in consequence of\nthem. If the manufactures, especially, of which those commodities are the\nmaterials, should ever come to flourish in the country, the market, though\nit might not be much enlarged, would at least be brought much nearer to\nthe place of growth than before; and the price of those materials might at\nleast be increased by what had usually been the expense of transporting\nthem to distant countries. Though it might not rise, therefore, in the\nsame proportion as that of butcher\u2019s meat, it ought naturally to rise\nsomewhat, and it ought certainly not to fall.\nIn England, however, notwithstanding the flourishing state of its woollen\nmanufacture, the price of English wool has fallen very considerably since\nthe time of Edward III. There are many authentic records which demonstrate\nthat, during the reign of that prince (towards the middle of the\nfourteenth century, or about 1339), what was reckoned the moderate and\nreasonable price of the tod, or twenty-eight pounds of English wool, was\nnot less than ten shillings of the money of those times {See Smith\u2019s\nMemoirs of Wool, vol. i c. 5, 6, 7. also vol. ii.}, containing, at the\nrate of twenty-pence the ounce, six ounces of silver, Tower weight, equal\nto about thirty shillings of our present money. In the present times,\none-and-twenty shillings the tod may be reckoned a good price for very\ngood English wool. The money price of wool, therefore, in the time of\nEdward III. was to its money price in the present times as ten to seven.\nThe superiority of its real price was still greater. At the rate of six\nshillings and eightpence the quarter, ten shillings was in those ancient\ntimes the price of twelve bushels of wheat. At the rate of twenty-eight\nshillings the quarter, one-and-twenty shillings is in the present times\nthe price of six bushels only. The proportion between the real price of\nancient and modern times, therefore, is as twelve to six, or as two to\none. In those ancient times, a tod of wool would have purchased twice the\nquantity of subsistence which it will purchase at present, and\nconsequently twice the quantity of labour, if the real recompence of\nlabour had been the same in both periods.\nThis degradation, both in the real and nominal value of wool, could never\nhave happened in consequence of the natural course of things. It has\naccordingly been the effect of violence and artifice. First, of the\nabsolute prohibition of exporting wool from England: secondly, of the\npermission of importing it from Spain, duty free: thirdly, of the\nprohibition of exporting it from Ireland to another country but England.\nIn consequence of these regulations, the market for English wool, instead\nof being somewhat extended, in consequence of the improvement of England,\nhas been confined to the home market, where the wool of several other\ncountries is allowed to come into competition with it, and where that of\nIreland is forced into competition with it. As the woollen manufactures,\ntoo, of Ireland, are fully as much discouraged as is consistent with\njustice and fair dealing, the Irish can work up but a smaller part of\ntheir own wool at home, and are therefore obliged to send a greater\nproportion of it to Great Britain, the only market they are allowed.\nI have not been able to find any such authentic records concerning the\nprice of raw hides in ancient times. Wool was commonly paid as a subsidy\nto the king, and its valuation in that subsidy ascertains, at least in\nsome degree, what was its ordinary price. But this seems not to have been\nthe case with raw hides. Fleetwood, however, from an account in 1425,\nbetween the prior of Burcester Oxford and one of his canons, gives us\ntheir price, at least as it was stated upon that particular occasion, viz.\nfive ox hides at twelve shillings; five cow hides at seven shillings and\nthreepence; thirtysix sheep skins of two years old at nine shillings;\nsixteen calf skins at two shillings. In 1425, twelve shillings contained\nabout the same quantity of silver as four-and-twenty shillings of our\npresent money. An ox hide, therefore, was in this account valued at the\nsame quantity of silver as 4s. \u2158ths of our present money. Its nominal\nprice was a good deal lower than at present. But at the rate of six\nshillings and eightpence the quarter, twelve shillings would in those\ntimes have purchased fourteen bushels and four-fifths of a bushel of\nwheat, which, at three and sixpence the bushel, would in the present times\ncost 51s. 4d. An ox hide, therefore, would in those times have purchased\nas much corn as ten shillings and threepence would purchase at present.\nIts real value was equal to ten shillings and threepence of our present\nmoney. In those ancient times, when the cattle were half starved during\nthe greater part of the winter, we cannot suppose that they were of a very\nlarge size. An ox hide which weighs four stone of sixteen pounds of\navoirdupois, is not in the present times reckoned a bad one; and in those\nancient times would probably have been reckoned a very good one. But at\nhalf-a-crown the stone, which at this moment (February 1773) I understand\nto be the common price, such a hide would at present cost only ten\nshillings. Through its nominal price, therefore, is higher in the present\nthan it was in those ancient times, its real price, the real quantity of\nsubsistence which it will purchase or command, is rather somewhat lower.\nThe price of cow hides, as stated in the above account, is nearly in the\ncommon proportion to that of ox hides. That of sheep skins is a good deal\nabove it. They had probably been sold with the wool. That of calves skins,\non the contrary, is greatly below it. In countries where the price of\ncattle is very low, the calves, which are not intended to be reared in\norder to keep up the stock, are generally killed very young, as was the\ncase in Scotland twenty or thirty years ago. It saves the milk, which\ntheir price would not pay for. Their skins, therefore, are commonly good\nfor little.\nThe price of raw hides is a good deal lower at present than it was a few\nyears ago; owing probably to the taking off the duty upon seal skins, and\nto the allowing, for a limited time, the importation of raw hides from\nIreland, and from the plantations, duty free, which was done in 1769. Take\nthe whole of the present century at an average, their real price has\nprobably been somewhat higher than it was in those ancient times. The\nnature of the commodity renders it not quite so proper for being\ntransported to distant markets as wool. It suffers more by keeping. A\nsalted hide is reckoned inferior to a fresh one, and sells for a lower\nprice. This circumstance must necessarily have some tendency to sink the\nprice of raw hides produced in a country which does not manufacture them,\nbut is obliged to export them, and comparatively to raise that of those\nproduced in a country which does manufacture them. It must have some\ntendency to sink their price in a barbarous, and to raise it in an\nimproved and manufacturing country. It must have had some tendency,\ntherefore, to sink it in ancient, and to raise it in modern times. Our\ntanners, besides, have not been quite so successful as our clothiers, in\nconvincing the wisdom of the nation, that the safety of the commonwealth\ndepends upon the prosperity of their particular manufacture. They have\naccordingly been much less favoured. The exportation of raw hides has,\nindeed, been prohibited, and declared a nuisance; but their importation\nfrom foreign countries has been subjected to a duty; and though this duty\nhas been taken off from those of Ireland and the plantations (for the\nlimited time of five years only), yet Ireland has not been confined to the\nmarket of Great Britain for the sale of its surplus hides, or of those\nwhich are not manufactured at home. The hides of common cattle have, but\nwithin these few years, been put among the enumerated commodities which\nthe plantations can send nowhere but to the mother country; neither has\nthe commerce of Ireland been in this case oppressed hitherto, in order to\nsupport the manufactures of Great Britain.\nWhatever regulations tend to sink the price, either of wool or of raw\nhides, below what it naturally would be, must, in an improved and\ncultivated country, have some tendency to raise the price of butcher\u2019s\nmeat. The price both of the great and small cattle, which are fed on\nimproved and cultivated land, must be sufficient to pay the rent which the\nlandlord, and the profit which the farmer, has reason to expect from\nimproved and cultivated land. If it is not, they will soon cease to feed\nthem. Whatever part of this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool and\nthe hide, must be paid by the carcase. The less there is paid for the one,\nthe more must be paid for the other. In what manner this price is to be\ndivided upon the different parts of the beast, is indifferent to the\nlandlords and farmers, provided it is all paid to them. In an improved and\ncultivated country, therefore, their interest as landlords and farmers\ncannot be much affected by such regulations, though their interest as\nconsumers may, by the rise in the price of provisions. It would be quite\notherwise, however, in an unimproved and uncultivated country, where the\ngreater part of the lands could be applied to no other purpose but the\nfeeding of cattle, and where the wool and the hide made the principal part\nof the value of those cattle. Their interest as landlords and farmers\nwould in this case be very deeply affected by such regulations, and their\ninterest as consumers very little. The fall in the price of the wool and\nthe hide would not in this case raise the price of the carcase; because\nthe greater part of the lands of the country being applicable to no other\npurpose but the feeding of cattle, the same number would still continue to\nbe fed. The same quantity of butcher\u2019s meat would still come to market.\nThe demand for it would be no greater than before. Its price, therefore,\nwould be the same as before. The whole price of cattle would fall, and\nalong with it both the rent and the profit of all those lands of which\ncattle was the principal produce, that is, of the greater part of the\nlands of the country. The perpetual prohibition of the exportation of\nwool, which is commonly, but very falsely, ascribed to Edward III., would,\nin the then circumstances of the country, have been the most destructive\nregulation which could well have been thought of. It would not only have\nreduced the actual value of the greater part of the lands in the kingdom,\nbut by reducing the price of the most important species of small cattle,\nit would have retarded very much its subsequent improvement.\nThe wool of Scotland fell very considerably in its price in consequence of\nthe union with England, by which it was excluded from the great market of\nEurope, and confined to the narrow one of Great Britain. The value of the\ngreater part of the lands in the southern counties of Scotland, which are\nchiefly a sheep country, would have been very deeply affected by this\nevent, had not the rise in the price of butcher\u2019s meat fully compensated\nthe fall in the price of wool.\nAs the efficacy of human industry, in increasing the quantity either of\nwool or of raw hides, is limited, so far as it depends upon the produce of\nthe country where it is exerted; so it is uncertain so far as it depends\nupon the produce of other countries. It so far depends not so much upon\nthe quantity which they produce, as upon that which they do not\nmanufacture; and upon the restraints which they may or may not think\nproper to impose upon the exportation of this sort of rude produce. These\ncircumstances, as they are altogether independent of domestic industry, so\nthey necessarily render the efficacy of its efforts more or less\nuncertain. In multiplying this sort of rude produce, therefore, the\nefficacy of human industry is not only limited, but uncertain.\nIn multiplying another very important sort of rude produce, the quantity\nof fish that is brought to market, it is likewise both limited and\nuncertain. It is limited by the local situation of the country, by the\nproximity or distance of its different provinces from the sea, by the\nnumber of its lakes and rivers, and by what may be called the fertility or\nbarrenness of those seas, lakes, and rivers, as to this sort of rude\nproduce. As population increases, as the annual produce of the land and\nlabour of the country grows greater and greater, there come to be more\nbuyers of fish; and those buyers, too, have a greater quantity and variety\nof other goods, or, what is the same thing, the price of a greater\nquantity and variety of other goods, to buy with. But it will generally be\nimpossible to supply the great and extended market, without employing a\nquantity of labour greater than in proportion to what had been requisite\nfor supplying the narrow and confined one. A market which, from requiring\nonly one thousand, comes to require annually ten thousand ton of fish, can\nseldom be supplied, without employing more than ten times the quantity of\nlabour which had before been sufficient to supply it. The fish must\ngenerally be sought for at a greater distance, larger vessels must be\nemployed, and more expensive machinery of every kind made use of. The real\nprice of this commodity, therefore, naturally rises in the progress of\nimprovement. It has accordingly done so, I believe, more or less in every\ncountry.\nThough the success of a particular day\u2019s fishing may be a very uncertain\nmatter, yet the local situation of the country being supposed, the general\nefficacy of industry in bringing a certain quantity of fish to market,\ntaking the course of a year, or of several years together, it may,\nperhaps, be thought is certain enough; and it, no doubt, is so. As it\ndepends more, however, upon the local situation of the country, than upon\nthe state of its wealth and industry; as upon this account it may in\ndifferent countries be the same in very different periods of improvement,\nand very different in the same period; its connection with the state of\nimprovement is uncertain; and it is of this sort of uncertainty that I am\nhere speaking.\nIn increasing the quantity of the different minerals and metals which are\ndrawn from the bowels of the earth, that of the more precious ones\nparticularly, the efficacy of human industry seems not to be limited, but\nto be altogether uncertain.\nThe quantity of the precious metals which is to be found in any country,\nis not limited by any thing in its local situation, such as the fertility\nor barrenness of its own mines. Those metals frequently abound in\ncountries which possess no mines. Their quantity, in every particular\ncountry, seems to depend upon two different circumstances; first, upon its\npower of purchasing, upon the state of its industry, upon the annual\nproduce of its land and labour, in consequence of which it can afford to\nemploy a greater or a smaller quantity of labour and subsistence, in\nbringing or purchasing such superfluities as gold and silver, either from\nits own mines, or from those of other countries; and, secondly, upon the\nfertility or barrenness of the mines which may happen at any particular\ntime to supply the commercial world with those metals. The quantity of\nthose metals in the countries most remote from the mines, must be more or\nless affected by this fertility or barrenness, on account of the easy and\ncheap transportation of those metals, of their small bulk and great value.\nTheir quantity in China and Indostan must have been more or less affected\nby the abundance of the mines of America.\nSo far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the former\nof those two circumstances (the power of purchasing), their real price,\nlike that of all other luxuries and superfluities, is likely to rise with\nthe wealth and improvement of the country, and to fall with its poverty\nand depression. Countries which have a great quantity of labour and\nsubsistence to spare, can afford to purchase any particular quantity of\nthose metals at the expense of a greater quantity of labour and\nsubsistence, than countries which have less to spare.\nSo far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the latter\nof those two circumstances (the fertility or barrenness of the mines which\nhappen to supply the commercial world), their real price, the real\nquantity of labour and subsistence which they will purchase or exchange\nfor, will, no doubt, sink more or less in proportion to the fertility, and\nrise in proportion to the barrenness of those mines.\nThe fertility or barrenness of the mines, however, which may happen at any\nparticular time to supply the commercial world, is a circumstance which,\nit is evident, may have no sort of connection with the state of industry\nin a particular country. It seems even to have no very necessary\nconnection with that of the world in general. As arts and commerce,\nindeed, gradually spread themselves over a greater and a greater part of\nthe earth, the search for new mines, being extended over a wider surface,\nmay have somewhat a better chance for being successful than when confined\nwithin narrower bounds. The discovery of new mines, however, as the old\nones come to be gradually exhausted, is a matter of the greatest\nuncertainty, and such as no human skill or industry can insure. All\nindications, it is acknowledged, are doubtful; and the actual discovery\nand successful working of a new mine can alone ascertain the reality of\nits value, or even of its existence. In this search there seem to be no\ncertain limits, either to the possible success, or to the possible\ndisappointment of human industry. In the course of a century or two, it is\npossible that new mines may be discovered, more fertile than any that have\never yet been known; and it is just equally possible, that the most\nfertile mine then known may be more barren than any that was wrought\nbefore the discovery of the mines of America. Whether the one or the other\nof those two events may happen to take place, is of very little importance\nto the real wealth and prosperity of the world, to the real value of the\nannual produce of the land and labour of mankind. Its nominal value, the\nquantity of gold and silver by which this annual produce could be\nexpressed or represented, would, no doubt, be very different; but its real\nvalue, the real quantity of labour which it could purchase or command,\nwould be precisely the same. A shilling might, in the one case, represent\nno more labour than a penny does at present; and a penny, in the other,\nmight represent as much as a shilling does now. But in the one case, he\nwho had a shilling in his pocket would be no richer than he who has a\npenny at present; and in the other, he who had a penny would be just as\nrich as he who has a shilling now. The cheapness and abundance of gold and\nsilver plate would be the sole advantage which the world could derive from\nthe one event; and the dearness and scarcity of those trifling\nsuperfluities, the only inconveniency it could suffer from the other.\nConclusion of the Digression concerning the Variations in the Value of\nSilver.\nThe greater part of the writers who have collected the money price of\nthings in ancient times, seem to have considered the low money price of\ncorn, and of goods in general, or, in other words, the high value of gold\nand silver, as a proof, not only of the scarcity of those metals, but of\nthe poverty and barbarism of the country at the time when it took place.\nThis notion is connected with the system of political economy, which\nrepresents national wealth as consisting in the abundance and national\npoverty in the scarcity, of gold and silver; a system which I shall\nendeavour to explain and examine at great length in the fourth book of\nthis Inquiry. I shall only observe at present, that the high value of the\nprecious metals can be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of any\nparticular country at the time when it took place. It is a proof only of\nthe barrenness of the mines which happened at that time to supply the\ncommercial world. A poor country, as it cannot afford to buy more, so it\ncan as little afford to pay dearer for gold and silver than a rich one;\nand the value of those metals, therefore, is not likely to be higher in\nthe former than in the latter. In China, a country much richer than any\npart of Europe, the value of the precious metals is much higher than in\nany part of Europe. As the wealth of Europe, indeed, has increased greatly\nsince the discovery of the mines of America, so the value of gold and\nsilver has gradually diminished. This diminution of their value, however,\nhas not been owing to the increase of the real wealth of Europe, of the\nannual produce of its land and labour, but to the accidental discovery of\nmore abundant mines than any that were known before. The increase of the\nquantity of gold and silver in Europe, and the increase of its\nmanufactures and agriculture, are two events which, though they have\nhappened nearly about the same time, yet have arisen from very different\ncauses, and have scarce any natural connection with one another. The one\nhas arisen from a mere accident, in which neither prudence nor policy\neither had or could have any share; the other, from the fall of the feudal\nsystem, and from the establishment of a government which afforded to\nindustry the only encouragement which it requires, some tolerable security\nthat it shall enjoy the fruits of its own labour. Poland, where the feudal\nsystem still continues to take place, is at this day as beggarly a country\nas it was before the discovery of America. The money price of corn,\nhowever, has risen; the real value of the precious metals has fallen in\nPoland, in the same manner as in other parts of Europe. Their quantity,\ntherefore, must have increased there as in other places, and nearly in the\nsame proportion to the annual produce of its land and labour. This\nincrease of the quantity of those metals, however, has not, it seems,\nincreased that annual produce, has neither improved the manufactures and\nagriculture of the country, nor mended the circumstances of its\ninhabitants. Spain and Portugal, the countries which possess the mines,\nare, after Poland, perhaps the two most beggarly countries in Europe. The\nvalue of the precious metals, however, must be lower in Spain and Portugal\nthan in any other part of Europe, as they come from those countries to all\nother parts of Europe, loaded, not only with a freight and an insurance,\nbut with the expense of smuggling, their exportation being either\nprohibited or subjected to a duty. In proportion to the annual produce of\nthe land and labour, therefore, their quantity must be greater in those\ncountries than in any other part of Europe; those countries, however, are\npoorer than the greater part of Europe. Though the feudal system has been\nabolished in Spain and Portugal, it has not been succeeded by a much\nbetter.\nAs the low value of gold and silver, therefore, is no proof of the wealth\nand flourishing state of the country where it takes place; so neither is\ntheir high value, or the low money price either of goods in general, or of\ncorn in particular, any proof of its poverty and barbarism.\nBut though the low money price, either of goods in general, or of corn in\nparticular, be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of the times, the low\nmoney price of some particular sorts of goods, such as cattle, poultry,\ngame of all kinds, etc. in proportion to that of corn, is a most decisive\none. It clearly demonstrates, first, their great abundance in proportion\nto that of corn, and, consequently, the great extent of the land which\nthey occupied in proportion to what was occupied by corn; and, secondly,\nthe low value of this land in proportion to that of corn land, and,\nconsequently, the uncultivated and unimproved state of the far greater\npart of the lands of the country. It clearly demonstrates, that the stock\nand population of the country did not bear the same proportion to the\nextent of its territory, which they commonly do in civilized countries;\nand that society was at that time, and in that country, but in its\ninfancy. From the high or low money price, either of goods in general, or\nof corn in particular, we can infer only, that the mines, which at that\ntime happened to supply the commercial world with gold and silver, were\nfertile or barren, not that the country was rich or poor. But from the\nhigh or low money price of some sorts of goods in proportion to that of\nothers, we can infer, with a degree of probability that approaches almost\nto certainty, that it was rich or poor, that the greater part of its lands\nwere improved or unimproved, and that it was either in a more or less\nbarbarous state, or in a more or less civilized one.\nAny rise in the money price of goods which proceeded altogether from the\ndegradation of the value of silver, would affect all sorts of goods\nequally, and raise their price universally, a third, or a fourth, or a\nfifth part higher, according as silver happened to lose a third, or a\nfourth, or a fifth part of its former value. But the rise in the price of\nprovisions, which has been the subject of so much reasoning and\nconversation, does not affect all sorts of provisions equally. Taking the\ncourse of the present century at an average, the price of corn, it is\nacknowledged, even by those who account for this rise by the degradation\nof the value of silver, has risen much less than that of some other sorts\nof provisions. The rise in the price of those other sorts of provisions,\ntherefore, cannot be owing altogether to the degradation of the value of\nsilver. Some other causes must be taken into the account; and those which\nhave been above assigned, will, perhaps, without having recourse to the\nsupposed degradation of the value of silver, sufficiently explain this\nrise in those particular sorts of provisions, of which the price has\nactually risen in proportion to that of corn.\nAs to the price of corn itself, it has, during the sixty-four first years\nof the present century, and before the late extraordinary course of bad\nseasons, been somewhat lower than it was during the sixty-four last years\nof the preceding century. This fact is attested, not only by the accounts\nof Windsor market, but by the public fiars of all the different counties\nof Scotland, and by the accounts of several different markets in France,\nwhich have been collected with great diligence and fidelity by Mr\nMessance, and by Mr Dupr\u00e9 de St Maur. The evidence is more complete than\ncould well have been expected in a matter which is naturally so very\ndifficult to be ascertained.\nAs to the high price of corn during these last ten or twelve years, it can\nbe sufficiently accounted for from the badness of the seasons, without\nsupposing any degradation in the value of silver.\nThe opinion, therefore, that silver is continually sinking in its value,\nseems not to be founded upon any good observations, either upon the prices\nof corn, or upon those of other provisions.\nThe same quantity of silver, it may perhaps be said, will, in the present\ntimes, even according to the account which has been here given, purchase a\nmuch smaller quantity of several sorts of provisions than it would have\ndone during some part of the last century; and to ascertain whether this\nchange be owing to a rise in the value of those goods, or to a fall in the\nvalue of silver, is only to establish a vain and useless distinction,\nwhich can be of no sort of service to the man who has only a certain\nquantity of silver to go to market with, or a certain fixed revenue in\nmoney. I certainly do not pretend that the knowledge of this distinction\nwill enable him to buy cheaper. It may not, however, upon that account be\naltogether useless.\nIt may be of some use to the public, by affording an easy proof of the\nprosperous condition of the country. If the rise in the price of some\nsorts of provisions be owing altogether to a fall in the value of silver,\nit is owing to a circumstance, from which nothing can be inferred but the\nfertility of the American mines. The real wealth of the country, the\nannual produce of its land and labour, may, notwithstanding this\ncircumstance, be either gradually declining, as in Portugal and Poland; or\ngradually advancing, as in most other parts of Europe. But if this rise in\nthe price of some sorts of provisions be owing to a rise in the real value\nof the land which produces them, to its increased fertility, or, in\nconsequence of more extended improvement and good cultivation, to its\nhaving been rendered fit for producing corn; it is owing to a circumstance\nwhich indicates, in the clearest manner, the prosperous and advancing\nstate of the country. The land constitutes by far the greatest, the most\nimportant, and the most durable part of the wealth of every extensive\ncountry. It may surely be of some use, or, at least, it may give some\nsatisfaction to the public, to have so decisive a proof of the increasing\nvalue of by far the greatest, the most important, and the most durable\npart of its wealth.\nIt may, too, be of some use to the public, in regulating the pecuniary\nreward of some of its inferior servants. If this rise in the price of some\nsorts of provisions be owing to a fall in the value of silver, their\npecuniary reward, provided it was not too large before, ought certainly to\nbe augmented in proportion to the extent of this fall. If it is not\naugmented, their real recompence will evidently be so much diminished. But\nif this rise of price is owing to the increased value, in consequence of\nthe improved fertility of the land which produces such provisions, it\nbecomes a much nicer matter to judge, either in what proportion any\npecuniary reward ought to be augmented, or whether it ought to be\naugmented at all. The extension of improvement and cultivation, as it\nnecessarily raises more or less, in proportion to the price of corn, that\nof every sort of animal food, so it as necessarily lowers that of, I\nbelieve, every sort of vegetable food. It raises the price of animal food;\nbecause a great part of the land which produces it, being rendered fit for\nproducing corn, must afford to the landlord and farmer the rent and\nprofit of corn land. It lowers the price of vegetable food; because, by\nincreasing the fertility of the land, it increases its abundance. The\nimprovements of agriculture, too, introduce many sorts of vegetable food,\nwhich requiring less land, and not more labour than corn, come much\ncheaper to market. Such are potatoes and maize, or what is called Indian\ncorn, the two most important improvements which the agriculture of Europe,\nperhaps, which Europe itself, has received from the great extension of its\ncommerce and navigation. Many sorts of vegetable food, besides, which in\nthe rude state of agriculture are confined to the kitchen-garden, and\nraised only by the spade, come, in its improved state, to be introduced\ninto common fields, and to be raised by the plough; such as turnips,\ncarrots, cabbages, etc. If, in the progress of improvement, therefore, the\nreal price of one species of food necessarily rises, that of another as\nnecessarily falls; and it becomes a matter of more nicety to judge how far\nthe rise in the one may be compensated by the fall in the other. When the\nreal price of butcher\u2019s meat has once got to its height (which, with\nregard to every sort, except perhaps that of hogs flesh, it seems to have\ndone through a great part of England more than a century ago), any rise\nwhich can afterwards happen in that of any other sort of animal food,\ncannot much affect the circumstances of the inferior ranks of people. The\ncircumstances of the poor, through a great part of England, cannot surely\nbe so much distressed by any rise in the price of poultry, fish,\nwild-fowl, or venison, as they must be relieved by the fall in that of\npotatoes.\nIn the present season of scarcity, the high price of corn no doubt\ndistresses the poor. But in times of moderate plenty, when corn is at its\nordinary or average price, the natural rise in the price of any other sort\nof rude produce cannot much affect them. They suffer more, perhaps, by the\nartificial rise which has been occasioned by taxes in the price of some\nmanufactured commodities, as of salt, soap, leather, candles, malt, beer,\nale, etc.\n_Effects of the Progress of Improvement upon the real Price of\nManufactures._\nIt is the natural effect of improvement, however, to diminish gradually\nthe real price of almost all manufactures. That of the manufacturing\nworkmanship diminishes, perhaps, in all of them without exception. In\nconsequence of better machinery, of greater dexterity, and of a more\nproper division and distribution of work, all of which are the natural\neffects of improvement, a much smaller quantity of labour becomes\nrequisite for executing any particular piece of work; and though, in\nconsequence of the flourishing circumstances of the society, the real\nprice of labour should rise very considerably, yet the great diminution of\nthe quantity will generally much more than compensate the greatest rise\nwhich can happen in the price.\nThere are, indeed, a few manufactures, in which the necessary rise in the\nreal price of the rude materials will more than compensate all the\nadvantages which improvement can introduce into the execution of the work.\nIn carpenters\u2019 and joiners\u2019 work, and in the coarser sort of cabinet work,\nthe necessary rise in the real price of barren timber, in consequence of\nthe improvement of land, will more than compensate all the advantages\nwhich can be derived from the best machinery, the greatest dexterity, and\nthe most proper division and distribution of work.\nBut in all cases in which the real price of the rude material either does\nnot rise at all, or does not rise very much, that of the manufactured\ncommodity sinks very considerably.\nThis diminution of price has, in the course of the present and preceding\ncentury, been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the materials\nare the coarser metals. A better movement of a watch, than about the\nmiddle of the last century could have been bought for twenty pounds, may\nnow perhaps be had for twenty shillings. In the work of cutlers and\nlocksmiths, in all the toys which are made of the coarser metals, and in\nall those goods which are commonly known by the name of Birmingham and\nSheffield ware, there has been, during the same period, a very great\nreduction of price, though not altogether so great as in watch-work. It\nhas, however, been sufficient to astonish the workmen of every other part\nof Europe, who in many cases acknowledge that they can produce no work of\nequal goodness for double or even for triple the price. There are perhaps\nno manufactures, in which the division of labour can be carried further,\nor in which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of\nimprovements, than those of which the materials are the coarser metals.\nIn the clothing manufacture there has, during the same period, been no\nsuch sensible reduction of price. The price of superfine cloth, I have\nbeen assured, on the contrary, has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty\nyears, risen somewhat in proportion to its quality, owing, it was said, to\na considerable rise in the price of the material, which consists\naltogether of Spanish wool. That of the Yorkshire cloth, which is made\naltogether of English wool, is said, indeed, during the course of the\npresent century, to have fallen a good deal in proportion to its quality.\nQuality, however, is so very disputable a matter, that I look upon all\ninformation of this kind as somewhat uncertain. In the clothing\nmanufacture, the division of labour is nearly the same now as it was a\ncentury ago, and the machinery employed is not very different. There may,\nhowever, have been some small improvements in both, which may have\noccasioned some reduction of price.\nBut the reduction will appear much more sensible and undeniable, if we\ncompare the price of this manufacture in the present times with what it\nwas in a much remoter period, towards the end of the fifteenth century,\nwhen the labour was probably much less subdivided, and the machinery\nemployed much more imperfect, than it is at present.\nIn 1487, being the 4th of Henry VII., it was enacted, that \u201cwhosoever\nshall sell by retail a broad yard of the finest scarlet grained, or of\nother grained cloth of the finest making, above sixteen shillings, shall\nforfeit forty shillings for every yard so sold.\u201d Sixteen shillings,\ntherefore, containing about the same quantity of silver as four-and-twenty\nshillings of our present money, was, at that time, reckoned not an\nunreasonable price for a yard of the finest cloth; and as this is a\nsumptuary law, such cloth, it is probable, had usually been sold somewhat\ndearer. A guinea may be reckoned the highest price in the present times.\nEven though the quality of the cloths, therefore, should be supposed\nequal, and that of the present times is most probably much superior, yet,\neven upon this supposition, the money price of the finest cloth appears to\nhave been considerably reduced since the end of the fifteenth century. But\nits real price has been much more reduced. Six shillings and eightpence\nwas then, and long afterwards, reckoned the average price of a quarter of\nwheat. Sixteen shillings, therefore, was the price of two quarters and\nmore than three bushels of wheat. Valuing a quarter of wheat in the\npresent times at eight-and-twenty shillings, the real price of a yard of\nfine cloth must, in those times, have been equal to at least three pounds\nsix shillings and sixpence of our present money. The man who bought it\nmust have parted with the command of a quantity of labour and subsistence\nequal to what that sum would purchase in the present times.\nThe reduction in the real price of the coarse manufacture, though\nconsiderable, has not been so great as in that of the fine.\nIn 1463, being the 3rd of Edward IV. it was enacted, that \u201cno servant in\nhusbandry nor common labourer, nor servant to any artificer inhabiting out\nof a city or burgh, shall use or wear in their clothing any cloth above\ntwo shillings the broad yard.\u201d In the 3rd of Edward IV., two shillings\ncontained very nearly the same quantity of silver as four of our present\nmoney. But the Yorkshire cloth which is now sold at four shillings the\nyard, is probably much superior to any that was then made for the wearing\nof the very poorest order of common servants. Even the money price of\ntheir clothing, therefore, may, in proportion to the quality, be somewhat\ncheaper in the present than it was in those ancient times. The real price\nis certainly a good deal cheaper. Tenpence was then reckoned what is\ncalled the moderate and reasonable price of a bushel of wheat. Two\nshillings, therefore, was the price of two bushels and near two pecks of\nwheat, which in the present times, at three shillings and sixpence the\nbushel, would be worth eight shillings and ninepence. For a yard of this\ncloth the poor servant must have parted with the power of purchasing a\nquantity of subsistence equal to what eight shillings and ninepence would\npurchase in the present times. This is a sumptuary law, too, restraining\nthe luxury and extravagance of the poor. Their clothing, therefore, had\ncommonly been much more expensive.\nThe same order of people are, by the same law, prohibited from wearing\nhose, of which the price should exceed fourteen-pence the pair, equal to\nabout eight-and-twenty pence of our present money. But fourteen-pence was\nin those times the price of a bushel and near two pecks of wheat; which in\nthe present times, at three and sixpence the bushel, would cost five\nshillings and threepence. We should in the present times consider this as\na very high price for a pair of stockings to a servant of the poorest and\nlowest order. He must however, in those times, have paid what was really\nequivalent to this price for them.\nIn the time of Edward IV. the art of knitting stockings was probably not\nknown in any part of Europe. Their hose were made of common cloth, which\nmay have been one of the causes of their dearness. The first person that\nwore stockings in England is said to have been Queen Elizabeth. She\nreceived them as a present from the Spanish ambassador.\nBoth in the coarse and in the fine woollen manufacture, the machinery\nemployed was much more imperfect in those ancient, than it is in the\npresent times. It has since received three very capital improvements,\nbesides, probably, many smaller ones, of which it may be difficult to\nascertain either the number or the importance. The three capital\nimprovements are, first, the exchange of the rock and spindle for the\nspinning-wheel, which, with the same quantity of labour, will perform more\nthan double the quantity of work. Secondly, the use of several very\ningenious machines, which facilitate and abridge, in a still greater\nproportion, the winding of the worsted and woollen yarn, or the proper\narrangement of the warp and woof before they are put into the loom; an\noperation which, previous to the invention of those machines, must have\nbeen extremely tedious and troublesome. Thirdly, the employment of the\nfulling-mill for thickening the cloth, instead of treading it in water.\nNeither wind nor water mills of any kind were known in England so early as\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century, nor, so far as I know, in any\nother part of Europe north of the Alps. They had been introduced into\nItaly some time before.\nThe consideration of these circumstances may, perhaps, in some measure,\nexplain to us why the real price both of the coarse and of the fine\nmanufacture was so much higher in those ancient than it is in the present\ntimes. It cost a greater quantity of labour to bring the goods to market.\nWhen they were brought thither, therefore, they must have purchased, or\nexchanged for the price of, a greater quantity.\nThe coarse manufacture probably was, in those ancient times, carried on in\nEngland in the same manner as it always has been in countries where arts\nand manufactures are in their infancy. It was probably a household\nmanufacture, in which every different part of the work was occasionally\nperformed by all the different members of almost every private family, but\nso as to be their work only when they had nothing else to do, and not to\nbe the principal business from which any of them derived the greater part\nof their subsistence. The work which is performed in this manner, it has\nalready been observed, comes always much cheaper to market than that which\nis the principal or sole fund of the workman\u2019s subsistence. The fine\nmanufacture, on the other hand, was not, in those times, carried on in\nEngland, but in the rich and commercial country of Flanders; and it was\nprobably conducted then, in the same manner as now, by people who derived\nthe whole, or the principal part of their subsistence from it. It was,\nbesides, a foreign manufacture, and must have paid some duty, the ancient\ncustom of tonnage and poundage at least, to the king. This duty, indeed,\nwould not probably be very great. It was not then the policy of Europe to\nrestrain, by high duties, the importation of foreign manufactures, but\nrather to encourage it, in order that merchants might be enabled to\nsupply, at as easy a rate as possible, the great men with the\nconveniencies and luxuries which they wanted, and which the industry of\ntheir own country could not afford them.\nThe consideration of these circumstances may, perhaps, in some measure\nexplain to us why, in those ancient times, the real price of the coarse\nmanufacture was, in proportion to that of the fine, so much lower than in\nthe present times.\nConclusion of the Chapter.\nI shall conclude this very long chapter with observing, that every\nimprovement in the circumstances of the society tends, either directly or\nindirectly, to raise the real rent of land to increase the real wealth of\nthe landlord, his power of purchasing the labour, or the produce of the\nlabour of other people.\nThe extension of improvement and cultivation tends to raise it directly.\nThe landlord\u2019s share of the produce necessarily increases with the\nincrease of the produce.\nThat rise in the real price of those parts of the rude produce of land,\nwhich is first the effect of the extended improvement and cultivation, and\nafterwards the cause of their being still further extended, the rise in\nthe price of cattle, for example, tends, too, to raise the rent of land\ndirectly, and in a still greater proportion. The real value of the\nlandlord\u2019s share, his real command of the labour of other people, not only\nrises with the real value of the produce, but the proportion of his share\nto the whole produce rises with it.\nThat produce, after the rise in its real price, requires no more labour to\ncollect it than before. A smaller proportion of it will, therefore, be\nsufficient to replace, with the ordinary profit, the stock which employs\nthat labour. A greater proportion of it must consequently belong to the\nlandlord.\nAll those improvements in the productive powers of labour, which tend\ndirectly to reduce the rent price of manufactures, tend indirectly to\nraise the real rent of land. The landlord exchanges that part of his rude\nproduce, which is over and above his own consumption, or, what comes to\nthe same thing, the price of that part of it, for manufactured produce.\nWhatever reduces the real price of the latter, raises that of the former.\nAn equal quantity of the former becomes thereby equivalent to a greater\nquantity of the latter; and the landlord is enabled to purchase a greater\nquantity of the conveniencies, ornaments, or luxuries which he has\noccasion for.\nEvery increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the\nquantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise\nthe real rent of land. A certain proportion of this labour naturally goes\nto the land. A greater number of men and cattle are employed in its\ncultivation, the produce increases with the increase of the stock which is\nthus employed in raising it, and the rent increases with the produce.\nThe contrary circumstances, the neglect of cultivation and improvement,\nthe fall in the real price of any part of the rude produce of land, the\nrise in the real price of manufactures from the decay of manufacturing art\nand industry, the declension of the real wealth of the society, all tend,\non the other hand, to lower the real rent of land, to reduce the real\nwealth of the landlord, to diminish his power of purchasing either the\nlabour, or the produce of the labour, of other people.\nThe whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, or, what\ncomes to the same thing, the whole price of that annual produce, naturally\ndivides itself, it has already been observed, into three parts; the rent\nof land, the wages of labour, and the profits of stock; and constitutes a\nrevenue to three different orders of people; to those who live by rent, to\nthose who live by wages, and to those who live by profit. These are the\nthree great, original, and constituent, orders of every civilized society,\nfrom whose revenue that of every other order is ultimately derived.\nThe interest of the first of those three great orders, it appears from\nwhat has been just now said, is strictly and inseparably connected with\nthe general interest of the society. Whatever either promotes or obstructs\nthe one, necessarily promotes or obstructs the other. When the public\ndeliberates concerning any regulation of commerce or police, the\nproprietors of land never can mislead it, with a view to promote the\ninterest of their own particular order; at least, if they have any\ntolerable knowledge of that interest. They are, indeed, too often\ndefective in this tolerable knowledge. They are the only one of the three\norders whose revenue costs them neither labour nor care, but comes to\nthem, as it were, of its own accord, and independent of any plan or\nproject of their own. That indolence which is the natural effect of the\nease and security of their situation, renders them too often, not only\nignorant, but incapable of that application of mind, which is necessary in\norder to foresee and understand the consequence of any public regulation.\nThe interest of the second order, that of those who live by wages, is as\nstrictly connected with the interest of the society as that of the first.\nThe wages of the labourer, it has already been shewn, are never so high as\nwhen the demand for labour is continually rising, or when the quantity\nemployed is every year increasing considerably. When this real wealth of\nthe society becomes stationary, his wages are soon reduced to what is\nbarely enough to enable him to bring up a family, or to continue the race\nof labourers. When the society declines, they fall even below this. The\norder of proprietors may perhaps gain more by the prosperity of the\nsociety than that of labourers; but there is no order that suffers so\ncruelly from its decline. But though the interest of the labourer is\nstrictly connected with that of the society, he is incapable either of\ncomprehending that interest, or of understanding its connexion with his\nown. His condition leaves him no time to receive the necessary\ninformation, and his education and habits are commonly such as to render\nhim unfit to judge, even though he was fully informed. In the public\ndeliberations, therefore, his voice is little heard, and less regarded;\nexcept upon particular occasions, when his clamour is animated, set on,\nand supported by his employers, not for his, but their own particular\npurposes.\nHis employers constitute the third order, that of those who live by\nprofit. It is the stock that is employed for the sake of profit, which\nputs into motion the greater part of the useful labour of every society.\nThe plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all\nthe most important operation of labour, and profit is the end proposed by\nall those plans and projects. But the rate of profit does not, like rent\nand wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension of the\nsociety. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor\ncountries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going\nfastest to ruin. The interest of this third order, therefore, has not the\nsame connexion with the general interest of the society, as that of the\nother two. Merchants and master manufacturers are, in this order, the two\nclasses of people who commonly employ the largest capitals, and who by\ntheir wealth draw to themselves the greatest share of the public\nconsideration. As during their whole lives they are engaged in plans and\nprojects, they have frequently more acuteness of understanding than the\ngreater part of country gentlemen. As their thoughts, however, are\ncommonly exercised rather about the interest of their own particular\nbranch of business. than about that of the society, their judgment, even\nwhen given with the greatest candour (which it has not been upon every\noccasion), is much more to be depended upon with regard to the former of\nthose two objects, than with regard to the latter. Their superiority over\nthe country gentleman is, not so much in their knowledge of the public\ninterest, as in their having a better knowledge of their own interest than\nhe has of his. It is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that\nthey have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to\ngive up both his own interest and that of the public, from a very simple\nbut honest conviction, that their interest, and not his, was the interest\nof the public. The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular\nbranch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different\nfrom, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market, and\nto narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen\nthe market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the\npublic; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can\nonly serve to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they\nnaturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the\nrest of their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation\nof commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to\nwith great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having\nbeen long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but\nwith the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men, whose\ninterest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have\ngenerally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who\naccordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.\n# PRICES OF WHEAT\nYear    Prices/Quarter  Average of different   Average prices of\nin each year     prices in one year    each year in money\nof

AND EMPLOYMENT OF STOCK.\nINTRODUCTION.\nIn that rude state of society, in which there is no division of labour, in\nwhich exchanges are seldom made, and in which every man provides every\nthing for himself, it is not necessary that any stock should be\naccumulated, or stored up before-hand, in order to carry on the business\nof the society. Every man endeavours to supply, by his own industry, his\nown occasional wants, as they occur. When he is hungry, he goes to the\nforest to hunt; when his coat is worn out, he clothes himself with the\nskin of the first large animal he kills: and when his hut begins to go to\nruin, he repairs it, as well as he can, with the trees and the turf that\nare nearest it.\nBut when the division of labour has once been thoroughly introduced, the\nproduce of a man\u2019s own labour can supply but a very small part of his\noccasional wants. The far greater part of them are supplied by the produce\nof other men\u2019s labour, which he purchases with the produce, or, what is\nthe same thing, with the price of the produce, of his own. But this\npurchase cannot be made till such time as the produce of his own labour\nhas not only been completed, but sold. A stock of goods of different\nkinds, therefore, must be stored up somewhere, sufficient to maintain him,\nand to supply him with the materials and tools of his work, till such time\nat least as both these events can be brought about. A weaver cannot apply\nhimself entirely to his peculiar business, unless there is before-hand\nstored up somewhere, either in his own possession, or in that of some\nother person, a stock sufficient to maintain him, and to supply him with\nthe materials and tools of his work, till he has not only completed, but\nsold his web. This accumulation must evidently be previous to his applying\nhis industry for so long a time to such a peculiar business.\nAs the accumulation of stock must, in the nature of things, be previous to\nthe division of labour, so labour can be more and more subdivided in\nproportion only as stock is previously more and more accumulated. The\nquantity of materials which the same number of people can work up,\nincreases in a great proportion as labour comes to be more and more\nsubdivided; and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced to\na greater degree of simplicity, a variety of new machines come to be\ninvented for facilitating and abridging those operations. As the division\nof labour advances, therefore, in order to give constant employment to an\nequal number of workmen, an equal stock of provisions, and a greater stock\nof materials and tools than what would have been necessary in a ruder\nstate of things, must be accumulated before-hand. But the number of\nworkmen in every branch of business generally increases with the division\nof labour in that branch; or rather it is the increase of their number\nwhich enables them to class and subdivide themselves in this manner.\nAs the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on this\ngreat improvement in the productive powers of labour, so that accumulation\nnaturally leads to this improvement. The person who employs his stock in\nmaintaining labour, necessarily wishes to employ it in such a manner as to\nproduce as great a quantity of work as possible. He endeavours, therefore,\nboth to make among his workmen the most proper distribution of employment,\nand to furnish them with the best machines which he can either invent or\nafford to purchase. His abilities, in both these respects, are generally\nin proportion to the extent of his stock, or to the number of people whom\nit can employ. The quantity of industry, therefore, not only increases in\nevery country with the increase of the stock which employs it, but, in\nconsequence of that increase, the same quantity of industry produces a\nmuch greater quantity of work.\nSuch are in general the effects of the increase of stock upon industry and\nits productive powers.\nIn the following book, I have endeavoured to explain the nature of stock,\nthe effects of its accumulation into capital of different kinds, and the\neffects of the different employments of those capitals. This book is\ndivided into five chapters. In the first chapter, I have endeavoured to\nshew what are the different parts or branches into which the stock, either\nof an individual, or of a great society, naturally divides itself. In the\nsecond, I have endeavoured to explain the nature and operation of money,\nconsidered as a particular branch of the general stock of the society. The\nstock which is accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the\nperson to whom it belongs, or it may be lent to some other person. In the\nthird and fourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the manner in\nwhich it operates in both these situations. The fifth and last chapter\ntreats of the different effects which the different employments of capital\nimmediately produce upon the quantity, both of national industry, and of\nthe annual produce of land and labour.\nCHAPTER I.\nOF THE DIVISION OF STOCK.\nWhen the stock which a man possesses is no more than sufficient to\nmaintain him for a few days or a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving\nany revenue from it. He consumes it as sparingly as he can, and\nendeavours, by his labour, to acquire something which may supply its place\nbefore it be consumed altogether. His revenue is, in this case, derived\nfrom his labour only. This is the state of the greater part of the\nlabouring poor in all countries.\nBut when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or\nyears, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part\nof it, reserving only so much for his immediate consumption as may\nmaintain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock,\ntherefore, is distinguished into two parts. That part which he expects is\nto afford him this revenue is called his capital. The other is that which\nsupplies his immediate consumption, and which consists either, first, in\nthat portion of his whole stock which was originally reserved for this\npurpose; or, secondly, in his revenue, from whatever source derived, as it\ngradually comes in; or, thirdly, in such things as had been purchased by\neither of these in former years, and which are not yet entirely consumed,\nsuch as a stock of clothes, household furniture, and the like. In one or\nother, or all of these three articles, consists the stock which men\ncommonly reserve for their own immediate consumption.\nThere are two different ways in which a capital may be employed so as to\nyield a revenue or profit to its employer.\nFirst, it may be employed in raising, manufacturing, or purchasing goods,\nand selling them again with a profit. The capital employed in this manner\nyields no revenue or profit to its employer, while it either remains in\nhis possession, or continues in the same shape. The goods of the merchant\nyield him no revenue or profit till he sells them for money, and the money\nyields him as little till it is again exchanged for goods. His capital is\ncontinually going from him in one shape, and returning to him in another;\nand it is only by means of such circulation, or successive changes, that\nit can yield him any profit. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly\nbe called circulating capitals.\nSecondly, it may be employed in the improvement of land, in the purchase\nof useful machines and instruments of trade, or in such like things as\nyield a revenue or profit without changing masters, or circulating any\nfurther. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly be called fixed\ncapitals.\nDifferent occupations require very different proportions between the fixed\nand circulating capitals employed in them.\nThe capital of a merchant, for example, is altogether a circulating\ncapital. He has occasion for no machines or instruments of trade, unless\nhis shop or warehouse be considered as such.\nSome part of the capital of every master artificer or manufacturer must be\nfixed in the instruments of his trade. This part, however, is very small\nin some, and very great in others, A master tailor requires no other\ninstruments of trade but a parcel of needles. Those of the master\nshoemaker are a little, though but a very little, more expensive. Those of\nthe weaver rise a good deal above those of the shoemaker. The far greater\npart of the capital of all such master artificers, however, is circulated\neither in the wages of their workmen, or in the price of their materials,\nand repaid, with a profit, by the price of the work.\nIn other works a much greater fixed capital is required. In a great\niron-work, for example, the furnace for melting the ore, the forge, the\nslit-mill, are instruments of trade which cannot be erected without a very\ngreat expense. In coal works, and mines of every kind, the machinery\nnecessary, both for drawing out the water, and for other purposes, is\nfrequently still more expensive.\nThat part of the capital of the farmer which is employed in the\ninstruments of agriculture is a fixed, that which is employed in the wages\nand maintenance of his labouring servants is a circulating capital. He\nmakes a profit of the one by keeping it in his own possession, and of the\nother by parting with it. The price or value of his labouring cattle is a\nfixed capital, in the same manner as that of the instruments of husbandry;\ntheir maintenance is a circulating capital, in the same manner as that of\nthe labouring servants. The farmer makes his profit by keeping the\nlabouring cattle, and by parting with their maintenance. Both the price\nand the maintenance of the cattle which are bought in and fattened, not\nfor labour, but for sale, are a circulating capital. The farmer makes his\nprofit by parting with them. A flock of sheep or a herd of cattle, that,\nin a breeding country, is brought in neither for labour nor for sale, but\nin order to make a profit by their wool, by their milk, and by their\nincrease, is a fixed capital. The profit is made by keeping them. Their\nmaintenance is a circulating capital. The profit is made by parting with\nit; and it comes back with both its own profit and the profit upon the\nwhole price of the cattle, in the price of the wool, the milk, and the\nincrease. The whole value of the seed, too, is properly a fixed capital.\nThough it goes backwards and forwards between the ground and the granary,\nit never changes masters, and therefore does not properly circulate. The\nfarmer makes his profit, not by its sale, but by its increase.\nThe general stock of any country or society is the same with that of all\nits inhabitants or members; and, therefore, naturally divides itself into\nthe same three portions, each of which has a distinct function or office.\nThe first is that portion which is reserved for immediate consumption, and\nof which the characteristic is, that it affords no revenue or profit. It\nconsists in the stock of food, clothes, household furniture, etc. which\nhave been purchased by their proper consumers, but which are not yet\nentirely consumed. The whole stock of mere dwelling-houses, too,\nsubsisting at any one time in the country, make a part of this first\nportion. The stock that is laid out in a house, if it is to be the\ndwelling-house of the proprietor, ceases from that moment to serve in the\nfunction of a capital, or to afford any revenue to its owner. A\ndwelling-house, as such, contributes nothing to the revenue of its\ninhabitant; and though it is, no doubt, extremely useful to him, it is as\nhis clothes and household furniture are useful to him, which, however,\nmake a part of his expense, and not of his revenue. If it is to be let to\na tenant for rent, as the house itself can produce nothing, the tenant\nmust always pay the rent out of some other revenue, which he derives,\neither from labour, or stock, or land. Though a house, therefore, may\nyield a revenue to its proprietor, and thereby serve in the function of a\ncapital to him, it cannot yield any to the public, nor serve in the\nfunction of a capital to it, and the revenue of the whole body of the\npeople can never be in the smallest degree increased by it. Clothes and\nhousehold furniture, in the same manner, sometimes yield a revenue, and\nthereby serve in the function of a capital to particular persons. In\ncountries where masquerades are common, it is a trade to let out\nmasquerade dresses for a night. Upholsterers frequently let furniture by\nthe month or by the year. Undertakers let the furniture of funerals by the\nday and by the week. Many people let furnished houses, and get a rent, not\nonly for the use of the house, but for that of the furniture. The revenue,\nhowever, which is derived from such things, must always be ultimately\ndrawn from some other source of revenue. Of all parts of the stock, either\nof an individual or of a society, reserved for immediate consumption, what\nis laid out in houses is most slowly consumed. A stock of clothes may last\nseveral years; a stock of furniture half a century or a century; but a\nstock of houses, well built and properly taken care of, may last many\ncenturies. Though the period of their total consumption, however, is more\ndistant, they are still as really a stock reserved for immediate\nconsumption as either clothes or household furniture.\nThe second of the three portions into which the general stock of the\nsociety divides itself, is the fixed capital; of which the characteristic\nis, that it affords a revenue or profit without circulating or changing\nmasters. It consists chiefly of the four following articles.\nFirst, of all useful machines and instruments of trade, which facilitate\nand abridge labour.\nSecondly, of all those profitable buildings which are the means of\nprocuring a revenue, not only to the proprietor who lets them for a rent,\nbut to the person who possesses them, and pays that rent for them; such as\nshops, warehouses, work-houses, farm-houses, with all their necessary\nbuildings, stables, granaries, etc. These are very different from mere\ndwelling-houses. They are a sort of instruments of trade, and may be\nconsidered in the same light.\nThirdly, of the improvements of land, of what has been profitably laid out\nin clearing, draining, inclosing, manuring, and reducing it into the\ncondition most proper for tillage and culture. An improved farm may very\njustly be regarded in the same light as those useful machines which\nfacilitate and abridge labour, and by means of which an equal circulating\ncapital can afford a much greater revenue to its employer. An improved\nfarm is equally advantageous and more durable than any of those machines,\nfrequently requiring no other repairs than the most profitable application\nof the farmer\u2019s capital employed in cultivating it.\nFourthly, of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants and\nmembers of the society. The acquisition of such talents, by the\nmaintenance of the acquirer during his education, study, or\napprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is a capital fixed and\nrealized, as it were, in his person. Those talents, as they make a part of\nhis fortune, so do they likewise that of the society to which he belongs.\nThe improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light as\na machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges labour,\nand which, though it costs a certain expense, repays that expense with a\nprofit.\nThe third and last of the three portions into which the general stock of\nthe society naturally divides itself, is the circulating capital, of which\nthe characteristic is, that it affords a revenue only by circulating or\nchanging masters. It is composed likewise of four parts.\nFirst, of the money, by means of which all the other three are circulated\nand distributed to their proper consumers.\nSecondly, of the stock of provisions which are in the possession of the\nbutcher, the grazier, the farmer, the corn-merchant, the brewer, etc. and\nfrom the sale of which they expect to derive a profit.\nThirdly, of the materials, whether altogether rude, or more or less\nmanufactured, of clothes, furniture, and building which are not yet made\nup into any of those three shapes, but which remain in the hands of the\ngrowers, the manufacturers, the mercers, and drapers, the\ntimber-merchants, the carpenters and joiners, the brick-makers, etc.\nFourthly, and lastly, of the work which is made up and completed, but\nwhich is still in the hands of the merchant and manufacturer, and not yet\ndisposed of or distributed to the proper consumers; such as the finished\nwork which we frequently find ready made in the shops of the smith, the\ncabinet-maker, the goldsmith, the jeweller, the china-merchant, etc. The\ncirculating capital consists, in this manner, of the provisions,\nmaterials, and finished work of all kinds that are in the hands of their\nrespective dealers, and of the money that is necessary for circulating and\ndistributing them to those who are finally to use or to consume them.\nOf these four parts, three\u2014provisions, materials, and finished work,\nare either annually or in a longer or shorter period, regularly withdrawn\nfrom it, and placed either in the fixed capital, or in the stock reserved\nfor immediate consumption.\nEvery fixed capital is both originally derived from, and requires to be\ncontinually supported by, a circulating capital. All useful machines and\ninstruments of trade are originally derived from a circulating capital,\nwhich furnishes the materials of which they are made, and the maintenance\nof the workmen who make them. They require, too, a capital of the same\nkind to keep them in constant repair.\nNo fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circulating\ncapital. The most useful machines and instruments of trade will produce\nnothing, without the circulating capital, which affords the materials they\nare employed upon, and the maintenance of the workmen who employ them.\nLand, however improved, will yield no revenue without a circulating\ncapital, which maintains the labourers who cultivate and collect its\nproduce.\nTo maintain and augment the stock which may be reserved for immediate\nconsumption, is the sole end and purpose both of the fixed and circulating\ncapitals. It is this stock which feeds, clothes, and lodges the people.\nTheir riches or poverty depend upon the abundant or sparing supplies which\nthose two capitals can afford to the stock reserved for immediate\nconsumption.\nSo great a part of the circulating capital being continually withdrawn\nfrom it, in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general\nstock of the society, it must in its turn require continual supplies\nwithout which it would soon cease to exist. These supplies are principally\ndrawn from three sources; the produce of land, of mines, and of fisheries.\nThese afford continual supplies of provisions and materials, of which part\nis afterwards wrought up into finished work and by which are replaced the\nprovisions, materials, and finished work, continually withdrawn from the\ncirculating capital. From mines, too, is drawn what is necessary for\nmaintaining and augmenting that part of it which consists in money. For\nthough, in the ordinary course of business, this part is not, like the\nother three, necessarily withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the\nother two branches of the general stock of the society, it must, however,\nlike all other things, be wasted and worn out at last, and sometimes, too,\nbe either lost or sent abroad, and must, therefore, require continual,\nthough no doubt much smaller supplies.\nLand, mines, and fisheries, require all both a fixed and circulating\ncapital to cultivate them; and their produce replaces, with a profit not\nonly those capitals, but all the others in the society. Thus the farmer\nannually replaces to the manufacturer the provisions which he had\nconsumed, and the materials which he had wrought up the year before; and\nthe manufacturer replaces to the farmer the finished work which he had\nwasted and worn out in the same time. This is the real exchange that is\nannually made between those two orders of people, though it seldom happens\nthat the rude produce of the one, and the manufactured produce of the\nother, are directly bartered for one another; because it seldom happens\nthat the farmer sells his corn and his cattle, his flax and his wool, to\nthe very same person of whom he chuses to purchase the clothes, furniture,\nand instruments of trade, which he wants. He sells, therefore, his rude\nproduce for money, with which he can purchase, wherever it is to be had,\nthe manufactured produce he has occasion for. Land even replaces, in part\nat least, the capitals with which fisheries and mines are cultivated. It\nis the produce of land which draws the fish from the waters; and it is the\nproduce of the surface of the earth which extracts the minerals from its\nbowels.\nThe produce of land, mines, and fisheries, when their natural fertility is\nequal, is in proportion to the extent and proper application of the\ncapitals employed about them. When the capitals are equal, and equally\nwell applied, it is in proportion to their natural fertility.\nIn all countries where there is a tolerable security, every man of common\nunderstanding will endeavour to employ whatever stock he can command, in\nprocuring either present enjoyment or future profit. If it is employed in\nprocuring present enjoyment, it is a stock reserved for immediate\nconsumption. If it is employed in procuring future profit, it must procure\nthis profit either by staying with him, or by going from him. In the one\ncase it is a fixed, in the other it is a circulating capital. A man must\nbe perfectly crazy, who, where there is a tolerable security, does not\nemploy all the stock which he commands, whether it be his own, or borrowed\nof other people, in some one or other of those three ways.\nIn those unfortunate countries, indeed, where men are continually afraid\nof the violence of their superiors, they frequently bury or conceal a\ngreat part of their stock, in order to have it always at hand to carry\nwith them to some place of safety, in case of their being threatened with\nany of those disasters to which they consider themselves at all times\nexposed. This is said to be a common practice in Turkey, in Indostan, and,\nI believe, in most other governments of Asia. It seems to have been a\ncommon practice among our ancestors during the violence of the feudal\ngovernment. Treasure-trove was, in those times, considered as no\ncontemptible part of the revenue of the greatest sovereigns in Europe. It\nconsisted in such treasure as was found concealed in the earth, and to\nwhich no particular person could prove any right. This was regarded, in\nthose times, as so important an object, that it was always considered as\nbelonging to the sovereign, and neither to the finder nor to the\nproprietor of the land, unless the right to it had been conveyed to the\nlatter by an express clause in his charter. It was put upon the same\nfooting with gold and silver mines, which, without a special clause in the\ncharter, were never supposed to be comprehended in the general grant of\nthe lands, though mines of lead, copper, tin, and coal were, as things of\nsmaller consequence.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF MONEY, CONSIDERED AS A PARTICULAR\nBRANCH OF THE GENERAL STOCK OF THE SOCIETY, OR OF THE EXPENSE OF MAINTAINING\nTHE NATIONAL CAPITAL.\nIt has been shown in the First Book, that the price of the greater part of\ncommodities resolves itself into three parts, of which one pays the wages\nof the labour, another the profits of the stock, and a third the rent of\nthe land which had been employed in producing and bringing them to market:\nthat there are, indeed, some commodities of which the price is made up of\ntwo of those parts only, the wages of labour, and the profits of stock;\nand a very few in which it consists altogether in one, the wages of\nlabour; but that the price of every commodity necessarily resolves itself\ninto some one or other, or all, of those three parts; every part of it\nwhich goes neither to rent nor to wages, being necessarily profit to some\nbody.\nSince this is the case, it has been observed, with regard to every\nparticular commodity, taken separately, it must be so with regard to all\nthe commodities which compose the whole annual produce of the land and\nlabour of every country, taken complexly. The whole price or exchangeable\nvalue of that annual produce must resolve itself into the same three\nparts, and be parcelled out among the different inhabitants of the\ncountry, either as the wages of their labour, the profits of their stock,\nor the rent of their land.\nBut though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and labour of\nevery country, is thus divided among, and constitutes a revenue to, its\ndifferent inhabitants; yet, as in the rent of a private estate, we\ndistinguish between the gross rent and the neat rent, so may we likewise\nin the revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country.\nThe gross rent of a private estate comprehends whatever is paid by the\nfarmer; the neat rent, what remains free to the landlord, after deducting\nthe expense of management, of repairs, and all other necessary charges; or\nwhat, without hurting his estate, he can afford to place in his stock\nreserved for immediate consumption, or to spend upon his table, equipage,\nthe ornaments of his house and furniture, his private enjoyments and\namusements. His real wealth is in proportion, not to his gross, but to his\nneat rent.\nThe gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country comprehends\nthe whole annual produce of their land and labour; the neat revenue, what\nremains free to them, after deducting the expense of maintaining first,\ntheir fixed, and, secondly, their circulating capital, or what, without\nencroaching upon their capital, they can place in their stock reserved for\nimmediate consumption, or spend upon their subsistence, conveniencies, and\namusements. Their real wealth, too, is in proportion, not to their gross,\nbut to their neat revenue.\nThe whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital must evidently be\nexcluded from the neat revenue of the society. Neither the materials\nnecessary for supporting their useful machines and instruments of trade,\ntheir profitable buildings, etc. nor the produce of the labour necessary\nfor fashioning those materials into the proper form, can ever make any\npart of it. The price of that labour may indeed make a part of it; as the\nworkmen so employed may place the whole value of their wages in their\nstock reserved for immediate consumption. But in other sorts of labour,\nboth the price and the produce go to this stock; the price to that of the\nworkmen, the produce to that of other people, whose subsistence,\nconveniencies, and amusements, are augmented by the labour of those\nworkmen.\nThe intention of the fixed capital is to increase the productive powers of\nlabour, or to enable the same number of labourers to perform a much\ngreater quantity of work. In a farm where all the necessary buildings,\nfences, drains, communications, etc. are in the most perfect good order,\nthe same number of labourers and labouring cattle will raise a much\ngreater produce, than in one of equal extent and equally good ground, but\nnot furnished with equal conveniencies. In manufactures, the same number\nof hands, assisted with the best machinery, will work up a much greater\nquantity of goods than with more imperfect instruments of trade. The\nexpense which is properly laid out upon a fixed capital of any kind, is\nalways repaid with great profit, and increases the annual produce by a\nmuch greater value than that of the support which such improvements\nrequire. This support, however, still requires a certain portion of that\nproduce. A certain quantity of materials, and the labour of a certain\nnumber of workmen, both of which might have been immediately employed to\naugment the food, clothing, and lodging, the subsistence and conveniencies\nof the society, are thus diverted to another employment, highly\nadvantageous indeed, but still different from this one. It is upon this\naccount that all such improvements in mechanics, as enable the same number\nof workmen to perform an equal quantity of work with cheaper and simpler\nmachinery than had been usual before, are always regarded as advantageous\nto every society. A certain quantity of materials, and the labour of a\ncertain number of workmen, which had before been employed in supporting a\nmore complex and expensive machinery, can afterwards be applied to augment\nthe quantity of work which that or any other machinery is useful only for\nperforming. The undertaker of some great manufactory, who employs a\nthousand a-year in the maintenance of his machinery, if he can reduce this\nexpense to five hundred, will naturally employ the other five hundred in\npurchasing an additional quantity of materials, to be wrought up by an\nadditional number of workmen. The quantity of that work, therefore, which\nhis machinery was useful only for performing, will naturally be augmented,\nand with it all the advantage and conveniency which the society can derive\nfrom that work.\nThe expense of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country, may very\nproperly be compared to that of repairs in a private estate. The expense\nof repairs may frequently be necessary for supporting the produce of the\nestate, and consequently both the gross and the neat rent of the landlord.\nWhen by a more proper direction, however, it can be diminished without\noccasioning any diminution of produce, the gross rent remains at least the\nsame as before, and the neat rent is necessarily augmented.\nBut though the whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital is thus\nnecessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the society, it is not the\nsame case with that of maintaining the circulating capital. Of the four\nparts of which this latter capital is composed, money, provisions,\nmaterials, and finished work, the three last, it has already been\nobserved, are regularly withdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed\ncapital of the society, or in their stock reserved for immediate\nconsumption. Whatever portion of those consumable goods is not employed in\nmaintaining the former, goes all to the latter, and makes a part of the\nneat revenue of the society. The maintenance of those three parts of the\ncirculating capital, therefore, withdraws no portion of the annual produce\nfrom the neat revenue of the society, besides what is necessary for\nmaintaining the fixed capital.\nThe circulating capital of a society is in this respect different from\nthat of an individual. That of an individual is totally excluded from\nmaking any part of his neat revenue, which must consist altogether in his\nprofits. But though the circulating capital of every individual makes a\npart of that of the society to which he belongs, it is not upon that\naccount totally excluded from making a part likewise of their neat\nrevenue. Though the whole goods in a merchant\u2019s shop must by no means be\nplaced in his own stock reserved for immediate consumption, they may in\nthat of other people, who, from a revenue derived from other funds, may\nregularly replace their value to him, together with its profits, without\noccasioning any diminution either of his capital or of theirs.\nMoney, therefore, is the only part of the circulating capital of a\nsociety, of which the maintenance can occasion any diminution in their\nneat revenue.\nThe fixed capital, and that part of the circulating capital which consists\nin money, so far as they affect the revenue of the society, bear a very\ngreat resemblance to one another.\nFirst, as those machines and instruments of trade, etc. require a certain\nexpense, first to erect them, and afterwards to support them, both which\nexpenses, though they make a part of the gross, are deductions from the\nneat revenue of the society; so the stock of money which circulates in any\ncountry must require a certain expense, first to collect it, and\nafterwards to support it; both which expenses, though they make a part of\nthe gross, are, in the same manner, deductions from the neat revenue of\nthe society. A certain quantity of very valuable materials, gold and\nsilver, and of very curious labour, instead of augmenting the stock\nreserved for immediate consumption, the subsistence, conveniencies, and\namusements of individuals, is employed in supporting that great but\nexpensive instrument of commerce, by means of which every individual in\nthe society has his subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements, regularly\ndistributed to him in their proper proportions.\nSecondly, as the machines and instruments of trade, etc. which compose the\nfixed capital either of an individual or of a society, make no part either\nof the gross or of the neat revenue of either; so money, by means of which\nthe whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed among all its\ndifferent members, makes itself no part of that revenue. The great wheel\nof circulation is altogether different from the goods which are circulated\nby means of it. The revenue of the society consists altogether in those\ngoods, and not in the wheel which circulates them. In computing either the\ngross or the neat revenue of any society, we must always, from the whole\nannual circulation of money and goods, deduct the whole value of the\nmoney, of which not a single farthing can ever make any part of either.\nIt is the ambiguity of language only which can make this proposition\nappear either doubtful or paradoxical. When properly explained and\nunderstood, it is almost self-evident.\nWhen we talk of any particular sum of money, we sometimes mean nothing but\nthe metal pieces of which it is composed, and sometimes we include in our\nmeaning some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in exchange\nfor it, or to the power of purchasing which the possession of it conveys.\nThus, when we say that the circulating money of England has been computed\nat eighteen millions, we mean only to express the amount of the metal\npieces, which some writers have computed, or rather have supposed, to\ncirculate in that country. But when we say that a man is worth fifty or a\nhundred pounds a-year, we mean commonly to express, not only the amount of\nthe metal pieces which are annually paid to him, but the value of the\ngoods which he can annually purchase or consume; we mean commonly to\nascertain what is or ought to be his way of living, or the quantity and\nquality of the necessaries and conveniencies of life in which he can with\npropriety indulge himself.\nWhen, by any particular sum of money, we mean not only to express the\namount of the metal pieces of which it is composed, but to include in its\nsignification some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in\nexchange for them, the wealth or revenue which it in this case denotes, is\nequal only to one of the two values which are thus intimated somewhat\nambiguously by the same word, and to the latter more properly than to the\nformer, to the money\u2019s worth more properly than to the money.\nThus, if a guinea be the weekly pension of a particular person, he can in\nthe course of the week purchase with it a certain quantity of subsistence,\nconveniencies, and amusements. In proportion as this quantity is great or\nsmall, so are his real riches, his real weekly revenue. His weekly revenue\nis certainly not equal both to the guinea and to what can be purchased\nwith it, but only to one or other of those two equal values, and to the\nlatter more properly than to the former, to the guinea\u2019s worth rather than\nto the guinea.\nIf the pension of such a person was paid to him, not in gold, but in a\nweekly bill for a guinea, his revenue surely would not so properly consist\nin the piece of paper, as in what he could get for it. A guinea may be\nconsidered as a bill for a certain quantity of necessaries and\nconveniencies upon all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood. The revenue of\nthe person to whom it is paid, does not so properly consist in the piece\nof gold, as in what he can get for it, or in what he can exchange it for.\nIf it could be exchanged for nothing, it would, like a bill upon a\nbankrupt, be of no more value than the most useless piece of paper.\nThough the weekly or yearly revenue of all the different inhabitants of\nany country, in the same manner, may be, and in reality frequently is,\npaid to them in money, their real riches, however, the real weekly or\nyearly revenue of all of them taken together, must always be great or\nsmall, in proportion to the quantity of consumable goods which they can\nall of them purchase with this money. The whole revenue of all of them\ntaken together is evidently not equal to both the money and the consumable\ngoods, but only to one or other of those two values, and to the latter\nmore properly than to the former.\nThough we frequently, therefore, express a person\u2019s revenue by the metal\npieces which are annually paid to him, it is because the amount of those\npieces regulates the extent of his power of purchasing, or the value of\nthe goods which he can annually afford to consume. We still consider his\nrevenue as consisting in this power of purchasing or consuming, and not in\nthe pieces which convey it.\nBut if this is sufficiently evident, even with regard to an individual, it\nis still more so with regard to a society. The amount of the metal pieces\nwhich are annually paid to an individual, is often precisely equal to his\nrevenue, and is upon that account the shortest and best expression of its\nvalue. But the amount of the metal pieces which circulate in a society,\ncan never be equal to the revenue of all its members. As the same guinea\nwhich pays the weekly pension of one man to-day, may pay that of another\nto-morrow, and that of a third the day thereafter, the amount of the metal\npieces which annually circulate in any country, must always be of much\nless value than the whole money pensions annually paid with them. But the\npower of purchasing, or the goods which can successively be bought with\nthe whole of those money pensions, as they are successively paid, must\nalways be precisely of the same value with those pensions; as must\nlikewise be the revenue of the different persons to whom they are paid.\nThat revenue, therefore, cannot consist in those metal pieces, of which\nthe amount is so much inferior to its value, but in the power of\npurchasing, in the goods which can successively be bought with them as\nthey circulate from hand to hand.\nMoney, therefore, the great wheel of circulation, the great instrument of\ncommerce, like all other instruments of trade, though it makes a part, and\na very valuable part, of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of the\nsociety to which it belongs; and though the metal pieces of which it is\ncomposed, in the course of their annual circulation, distribute to every\nman the revenue which properly belongs to him, they make themselves no\npart of that revenue.\nThirdly, and lastly, the machines and instruments of trade, etc. which\ncompose the fixed capital, bear this further resemblance to that part of\nthe circulating capital which consists in money; that as every saving in\nthe expense of erecting and supporting those machines, which does not\ndiminish the introductive powers of labour, is an improvement of the neat\nrevenue of the society; so every saving in the expense of collecting and\nsupporting that part of the circulating capital which consists in money is\nan improvement of exactly the same kind.\nIt is sufficiently obvious, and it has partly, too, been explained\nalready, in what manner every saving in the expense of supporting the\nfixed capital is an improvement of the neat revenue of the society. The\nwhole capital of the undertaker of every work is necessarily divided\nbetween his fixed and his circulating capital. While his whole capital\nremains the same, the smaller the one part, the greater must necessarily\nbe the other. It is the circulating capital which furnishes the materials\nand wages of labour, and puts industry into motion. Every saving,\ntherefore, in the expense of maintaining the fixed capital, which does not\ndiminish the productive powers of labour, must increase the fund which\nputs industry into motion, and consequently the annual produce of land and\nlabour, the real revenue of every society.\nThe substitution of paper in the room of gold and silver money, replaces a\nvery expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and\nsometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes to be carried on by a new\nwheel, which it costs less both to erect and to maintain than the old one.\nBut in what manner this operation is performed, and in what manner it\ntends to increase either the gross or the neat revenue of the society, is\nnot altogether so obvious, and may therefore require some further\nexplication.\nThere are several different sorts of paper money; but the circulating\nnotes of banks and bankers are the species which is best known, and which\nseems best adapted for this purpose.\nWhen the people of any particular country have such confidence in the\nfortune, probity and prudence of a particular banker, as to believe that\nhe is always ready to pay upon demand such of his promissory notes as are\nlikely to be at any time presented to him, those notes come to have the\nsame currency as gold and silver money, from the confidence that such\nmoney can at any time be had for them.\nA particular banker lends among his customers his own promissory notes,\nto the extent, we shall suppose, of a hundred thousand pounds. As those\nnotes serve all the purposes of money, his debtors pay him the same\ninterest as if he had lent them so much money. This interest is the\nsource of his gain. Though some of those notes are continually coming\nback upon him for payment, part of them continue to circulate for months\nand years together. Though he has generally in circulation, therefore,\nnotes to the extent of a hundred thousand pounds, twenty thousand pounds\nin gold and silver may, frequently, be a sufficient provision for\nanswering occasional demands. By this operation, therefore, twenty\nthousand pounds in gold and silver perform all the functions which a\nhundred thousand could otherwise have performed. The same exchanges may\nbe made, the same quantity of consumable goods may be circulated and\ndistributed to their proper consumers, by means of his promissory notes,\nto the value of a hundred thousand pounds, as by an equal value of gold\nand silver money. Eighty thousand pounds of gold and silver, therefore,\ncan in this manner be spared from the circulation of the country; and if\ndifferent operations of the same kind should, at the same time, be\ncarried on by many different banks and bankers, the whole circulation may\nthus be conducted with a fifth part only of the gold and silver which\nwould otherwise have been requisite.\nLet us suppose, for example, that the whole circulating money of some\nparticular country amounted, at a particular time, to one million\nsterling, that sum being then sufficient for circulating the whole annual\nproduce of their land and labour; let us suppose, too, that some time\nthereafter, different banks and bankers issued promissory notes payable to\nthe bearer, to the extent of one million, reserving in their different\ncoffers two hundred thousand pounds for answering occasional demands;\nthere would remain, therefore, in circulation, eight hundred thousand\npounds in gold and silver, and a million of bank notes, or eighteen\nhundred thousand pounds of paper and money together. But the annual\nproduce of the land and labour of the country had before required only one\nmillion to circulate and distribute it to its proper consumers, and that\nannual produce cannot be immediately augmented by those operations of\nbanking. One million, therefore, will be sufficient to circulate it after\nthem. The goods to be bought and sold being precisely the same as before,\nthe same quantity of money will be sufficient for buying and selling them.\nThe channel of circulation, if I may be allowed such an expression, will\nremain precisely the same as before. One million we have supposed\nsufficient to fill that channel. Whatever, therefore, is poured into it\nbeyond this sum, cannot run into it, but must overflow. One million eight\nhundred thousand pounds are poured into it. Eight hundred thousand pounds,\ntherefore, must overflow, that sum being over and above what can be\nemployed in the circulation of the country. But though this sum cannot be\nemployed at home, it is too valuable to be allowed to lie idle. It will,\ntherefore, be sent abroad, in order to seek that profitable employment\nwhich it cannot find at home. But the paper cannot go abroad; because at a\ndistance from the banks which issue it, and from the country in which\npayment of it can be exacted by law, it will not be received in common\npayments. Gold and silver, therefore, to the amount of eight hundred\nthousand pounds, will be sent abroad, and the channel of home circulation\nwill remain filled with a million of paper instead of a million of those\nmetals which filled it before.\nBut though so great a quantity of gold and silver is thus sent abroad, we\nmust not imagine that it is sent abroad for nothing, or that its\nproprietors make a present of it to foreign nations. They will exchange it\nfor foreign goods of some kind or another, in order to supply the\nconsumption either of some other foreign country, or of their own.\nIf they employ it in purchasing goods in one foreign country, in order to\nsupply the consumption of another, or in what is called the carrying\ntrade, whatever profit they make will be in addition to the neat revenue\nof their own country. It is like a new fund, created for carrying on a new\ntrade; domestic business being now transacted by paper, and the gold and\nsilver being converted into a fund for this new trade.\nIf they employ it in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, they\nmay either, first, purchase such goods as are likely to be consumed by\nidle people, who produce nothing, such as foreign wines, foreign silks,\netc.; or, secondly, they may purchase an additional stock of materials,\ntools, and provisions, in order to maintain and employ an additional\nnumber of industrious people, who reproduce, with a profit, the value of\ntheir annual consumption.\nSo far as it is employed in the first way, it promotes prodigality,\nincreases expense and consumption, without increasing production, or\nestablishing any permanent fund for supporting that expense, and is in\nevery respect hurtful to the society.\nSo far as it is employed in the second way, it promotes industry; and\nthough it increases the consumption of the society, it provides a\npermanent fund for supporting that consumption; the people who consume\nreproducing, with a profit, the whole value of their annual consumption.\nThe gross revenue of the society, the annual produce of their land and\nlabour, is increased by the whole value which the labour of those workmen\nadds to the materials upon which they are employed, and their neat revenue\nby what remains of this value, after deducting what is necessary for\nsupporting the tools and instruments of their trade.\nThat the greater part of the gold and silver which being forced abroad by\nthose operations of banking, is employed in purchasing foreign goods for\nhome consumption, is, and must be, employed in purchasing those of this\nsecond kind, seems not only probable, but almost unavoidable. Though some\nparticular men may sometimes increase their expense very considerably,\nthough their revenue does not increase at all, we maybe assured that no\nclass or order of men ever does so; because, though the principles of\ncommon prudence do not always govern the conduct of every individual, they\nalways influence that of the majority of every class or order. But the\nrevenue of idle people, considered as a class or order, cannot, in the\nsmallest degree, be increased by those operations of banking. Their\nexpense in general, therefore, cannot be much increased by them, though\nthat of a few individuals among them may, and in reality sometimes is. The\ndemand of idle people, therefore, for foreign goods, being the same, or\nvery nearly the same as before, a very small part of the money which,\nbeing forced abroad by those operations of banking, is employed in\npurchasing foreign goods for home consumption, is likely to be employed in\npurchasing those for their use. The greater part of it will naturally be\ndestined for the employment of industry, and not for the maintenance of\nidleness.\nWhen we compute the quantity of industry which the circulating capital of\nany society can employ, we must always have regard to those parts of it\nonly which consist in provisions, materials, and finished work; the other,\nwhich consists in money, and which serves only to circulate those three,\nmust always be deducted. In order to put industry into motion, three\nthings are requisite; materials to work upon, tools to work with, and the\nwages or recompence for the sake of which the work is done. Money is\nneither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with; and though the\nwages of the workman are commonly paid to him in money, his real revenue,\nlike that of all other men, consists, not in the money, but in the money\u2019s\nworth; not in the metal pieces, but in what can be got for them.\nThe quantity of industry which any capital can employ, must evidently be\nequal to the number of workmen whom it can supply with materials, tools,\nand a maintenance suitable to the nature of the work. Money may be\nrequisite for purchasing the materials and tools of the work, as well as\nthe maintenance of the workmen; but the quantity of industry which the\nwhole capital can employ, is certainly not equal both to the money which\npurchases, and to the materials, tools, and maintenance, which are\npurchased with it, but only to one or other of those two values, and to\nthe latter more properly than to the former.\nWhen paper is substituted in the room of gold and silver money, the\nquantity of the materials, tools, and maintenance, which the whole\ncirculating capital can supply, may be increased by the whole value of\ngold and silver which used to be employed in purchasing them. The whole\nvalue of the great wheel of circulation and distribution is added to the\ngoods which are circulated and distributed by means of it. The operation,\nin some measure, resembles that of the undertaker of some great work, who,\nin consequence of some improvement in mechanics, takes down his old\nmachinery, and adds the difference between its price and that of the new\nto his circulating capital, to the fund from which he furnishes materials\nand wages to his workmen.\nWhat is the proportion which the circulating money of any country bears to\nthe whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of it, it is\nperhaps impossible to determine. It has been computed by different authors\nat a fifth, at a tenth, at a twentieth, and at a thirtieth, part of that\nvalue. But how small soever the proportion which the circulating money may\nbear to the whole value of the annual produce, as but a part, and\nfrequently but a small part, of that produce, is ever destined for the\nmaintenance of industry, it must always bear a very considerable\nproportion to that part. When, therefore, by the substitution of paper,\nthe gold and silver necessary for circulation is reduced to, perhaps, a\nfifth part of the former quantity, if the value of only the greater part\nof the other four-fifths be added to the funds which are destined for the\nmaintenance of industry, it must make a very considerable addition to the\nquantity of that industry, and, consequently, to the value of the annual\nproduce of land and labour.\nAn operation of this kind has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty\nyears, been performed in Scotland, by the erection of new banking\ncompanies in almost every considerable town, and even in some country\nvillages. The effects of it have been precisely those above described. The\nbusiness of the country is almost entirely carried on by means of the\npaper of those different banking companies, with which purchases and\npayments of all kinds are commonly made. Silver very seldom appears,\nexcept in the change of a twenty shilling bank note, and gold still\nseldomer. But though the conduct of all those different companies has not\nbeen unexceptionable, and has accordingly required an act of parliament to\nregulate it, the country, notwithstanding, has evidently derived great\nbenefit from their trade. I have heard it asserted, that the trade of the\ncity of Glasgow doubled in about fifteen years after the first erection of\nthe banks there; and that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled\nsince the first erection of the two public banks at Edinburgh; of which\nthe one, called the Bank of Scotland, was established by act of parliament\nin 1695, and the other, called the Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727.\nWhether the trade, either of Scotland in general, or of the city of\nGlasgow in particular, has really increased in so great a proportion,\nduring so short a period, I do not pretend to know. If either of them has\nincreased in this proportion, it seems to be an effect too great to be\naccounted for by the sole operation of this cause. That the trade and\nindustry of Scotland, however, have increased very considerably during\nthis period, and that the banks have contributed a good deal to this\nincrease, cannot be doubted.\nThe value of the silver money which circulated in Scotland before the\nUnion in 1707, and which, immediately after it, was brought into the Bank\nof Scotland, in order to be recoined, amounted to \u00a3411,117: 10: 9\nsterling. No account has been got of the gold coin; but it appears from\nthe ancient accounts of the mint of Scotland, that the value of the gold\nannually coined somewhat exceeded that of the silver. There were a good\nmany people, too, upon this occasion, who, from a diffidence of repayment,\ndid not bring their silver into the Bank of Scotland; and there was,\nbesides, some English coin, which was not called in. The whole value of\nthe gold and silver, therefore, which circulated in Scotland before the\nUnion, cannot be estimated at less than a million sterling. It seems to\nhave constituted almost the whole circulation of that country; for though\nthe circulation of the Bank of Scotland, which had then no rival, was\nconsiderable, it seems to have made but a very small part of the whole. In\nthe present times, the whole circulation of Scotland cannot be estimated\nat less than two millions, of which that part which consists in gold and\nsilver, most probably, does not amount to half a million. But though the\ncirculating gold and silver of Scotland have suffered so great a\ndiminution during this period, its real riches and prosperity do not\nappear to have suffered any. Its agriculture, manufactures, and trade, on\nthe contrary, the annual produce of its land and labour, have evidently\nbeen augmented.\nIt is chiefly by discounting bills of exchange, that is, by advancing\nmoney upon them before they are due, that the greater part of banks and\nbankers issue their promissory notes. They deduct always, upon whatever\nsum they advance, the legal interest till the bill shall become due. The\npayment of the bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value\nof what had been advanced, together with a clear profit of the interest.\nThe banker, who advances to the merchant whose bill he discounts, not gold\nand silver, but his own promissory notes, has the advantage of being able\nto discount to a greater amount by the whole value of his promissory\nnotes, which he finds, by experience, are commonly in circulation. He is\nthereby enabled to make his clear gain of interest on so much a larger\nsum.\nThe commerce of Scotland, which at present is not very great, was still\nmore inconsiderable when the two first banking companies were established;\nand those companies would have had but little trade, had they confined\ntheir business to the discounting of bills of exchange. They invented,\ntherefore, another method of issuing their promissory notes; by granting\nwhat they call cash accounts, that is, by giving credit, to the extent of\na certain sum (two or three thousand pounds for example), to any\nindividual who could procure two persons of undoubted credit and good\nlanded estate to become surety for him, that whatever money should be\nadvanced to him, within the sum for which the credit had been given,\nshould be repaid upon demand, together with the legal interest. Credits of\nthis kind are, I believe, commonly granted by banks and bankers in all\ndifferent parts of the world. But the easy terms upon which the Scotch\nbanking companies accept of repayment are, so far as I know, peculiar to\nthem, and have perhaps been the principal cause, both of the great trade\nof those companies, and of the benefit which the country has received from\nit.\nWhoever has a credit of this kind with one of those companies, and borrows\na thousand pounds upon it, for example, may repay this sum piece-meal, by\ntwenty and thirty pounds at a time, the company discounting a\nproportionable part of the interest of the great sum, from the day on\nwhich each of those small sums is paid in, till the whole be in this\nmanner repaid. All merchants, therefore, and almost all men of business,\nfind it convenient to keep such cash accounts with them, and are thereby\ninterested to promote the trade of those companies, by readily receiving\ntheir notes in all payments, and by encouraging all those with whom they\nhave any influence to do the same. The banks, when their customers apply\nto them for money, generally advance it to them in their own promissory\nnotes. These the merchants pay away to the manufacturers for goods, the\nmanufacturers to the farmers for materials and provisions, the farmers to\ntheir landlords for rent; the landlords repay them to the merchants for\nthe conveniencies and luxuries with which they supply them, and the\nmerchants again return them to the banks, in order to balance their cash\naccounts, or to replace what they may have borrowed of them; and thus\nalmost the whole money business of the country is transacted by means of\nthem. Hence the great trade of those companies.\nBy means of those cash accounts, every merchant can, without imprudence,\ncarry on a greater trade than he otherwise could do. If there are two\nmerchants, one in London and the other in Edinburgh, who employ equal\nstocks in the same branch of trade, the Edinburgh merchant can, without\nimprudence, carry on a greater trade, and give employment to a greater\nnumber of people, than the London merchant. The London merchant must\nalways keep by him a considerable sum of money, either in his own coffers,\nor in those of his banker, who gives him no interest for it, in order to\nanswer the demands continually coming upon him for payment of the goods\nwhich he purchases upon credit. Let the ordinary amount of this sum be\nsupposed five hundred pounds; the value of the goods in his warehouse must\nalways be less, by five hundred pounds, than it would have been, had he\nnot been obliged to keep such a sum unemployed. Let us suppose that he\ngenerally disposes of his whole stock upon hand, or of goods to the value\nof his whole stock upon hand, once in the year. By being obliged to keep\nso great a sum unemployed, he must sell in a year five hundred pounds\nworth less goods than he might otherwise have done. His annual profits\nmust be less by all that he could have made by the sale of five hundred\npounds worth more goods; and the number of people employed in preparing\nhis goods for the market must be less by all those that five hundred\npounds more stock could have employed. The merchant in Edinburgh, on the\nother hand, keeps no money unemployed for answering such occasional\ndemands. When they actually come upon him, he satisfies them from his cash\naccount with the bank, and gradually replaces the sum borrowed with the\nmoney or paper which comes in from the occasional sales of his goods. With\nthe same stock, therefore, he can, without imprudence, have at all times\nin his warehouse a larger quantity of goods than the London merchant; and\ncan thereby both make a greater profit himself, and give constant\nemployment to a greater number of industrious people who prepare those\ngoods for the market. Hence the great benefit which the country has\nderived from this trade.\nThe facility of discounting bills of exchange, it may be thought, indeed,\ngives the English merchants a conveniency equivalent to the cash accounts\nof the Scotch merchants. But the Scotch merchants, it must be remembered,\ncan discount their bills of exchange as easily as the English merchants;\nand have, besides, the additional conveniency of their cash accounts.\nThe whole paper money of every kind which can easily circulate in any\ncountry, never can exceed the value of the gold and silver, of which it\nsupplies the place, or which (the commerce being supposed the same) would\ncirculate there, if there was no paper money. If twenty shilling notes,\nfor example, are the lowest paper money current in Scotland, the whole of\nthat currency which can easily circulate there, cannot exceed the sum of\ngold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the annual\nexchanges of twenty shillings value and upwards usually transacted within\nthat country. Should the circulating paper at any time exceed that sum, as\nthe excess could neither be sent abroad nor be employed in the circulation\nof the country, it must immediately return upon the banks, to be exchanged\nfor gold and silver. Many people would immediately perceive that they had\nmore of this paper than was necessary for transacting their business at\nhome; and as they could not send it abroad, they would immediately demand\npayment for it from the banks. When this superfluous paper was converted\ninto gold and silver, they could easily find a use for it, by sending it\nabroad; but they could find none while it remained in the shape of paper.\nThere would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the banks to the whole\nextent of this superfluous paper, and if they showed any difficulty or\nbackwardness in payment, to a much greater extent; the alarm which this\nwould occasion necessarily increasing the run.\nOver and above the expenses which are common to every branch of trade,\nsuch as the expense of house-rent, the wages of servants, clerks,\naccountants, etc. the expenses peculiar to a bank consist chiefly in two\narticles: first, in the expense of keeping at all times in its coffers,\nfor answering the occasional demands of the holders of its notes, a large\nsum of money, of which it loses the interest; and, secondly, in the\nexpense of replenishing those coffers as fast as they are emptied by\nanswering such occasional demands.\nA banking company which issues more paper than can be employed in the\ncirculation of the country, and of which the excess is continually\nreturning upon them for payment, ought to increase the quantity of gold\nand silver which they keep at all times in their coffers, not only in\nproportion to this excessive increase of their circulation, but in a much\ngreater proportion; their notes returning upon them much faster than in\nproportion to the excess of their quantity. Such a company, therefore,\nought to increase the first article of their expense, not only in\nproportion to this forced increase of their business, but in a much\ngreater proportion.\nThe coffers of such a company, too, though they ought to be filled much\nfuller, yet must empty themselves much faster than if their business was\nconfined within more reasonable bounds, and must require not only a more\nviolent, but a more constant and uninterrupted exertion of expense, in\norder to replenish them, The coin, too, which is thus continually drawn in\nsuch large quantities from their coffers, cannot be employed in the\ncirculation of the country. It comes in place of a paper which is over and\nabove what can be employed in that circulation, and is, therefore, over\nand above what can be employed in it too. But as that coin will not be\nallowed to lie idle, it must, in one shape or another, be sent abroad, in\norder to find that profitable employment which it cannot find at home; and\nthis continual exportation of gold and silver, by enhancing the\ndifficulty, must necessarily enhance still farther the expense of the\nbank, in finding new gold and silver in order to replenish those coffers,\nwhich empty themselves so very rapidly. Such a company, therefore, must in\nproportion to this forced increase of their business, increase the second\narticle of their expense still more than the first.\nLet us suppose that all the paper of a particular bank, which the\ncirculation of the country can easily absorb and employ, amounts exactly\nto forty thousand pounds, and that, for answering occasional demands, this\nbank is obliged to keep at all times in its coffers ten thousand pounds in\ngold and silver. Should this bank attempt to circulate forty-four thousand\npounds, the four thousand pounds which are over and above what the\ncirculation can easily absorb and employ, will return upon it almost as\nfast as they are issued. For answering occasional demands, therefore, this\nbank ought to keep at all times in its coffers, not eleven thousand pounds\nonly, but fourteen thousand pounds. It will thus gain nothing by the\ninterest of the four thousand pounds excessive circulation; and it will\nlose the whole expense of continually collecting four thousand pounds in\ngold and silver, which will be continually going out of its coffers as\nfast as they are brought into them.\nHad every particular banking company always understood and attended to its\nown particular interest, the circulation never could have been overstocked\nwith paper money. But every particular banking company has not always\nunderstood or attended to its own particular interest, and the circulation\nhas frequently been overstocked with paper money.\nBy issuing too great a quantity of paper, of which the excess was\ncontinually returning, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver, the\nBank of England was for many years together obliged to coin gold to the\nextent of between eight hundred thousand pounds and a million a-year; or,\nat an average, about eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds. For this\ngreat coinage, the bank (in consequence of the worn and degraded state into\nwhich the gold coin had fallen a few years ago) was frequently obliged to\npurchase gold bullion at the high price of four pounds an ounce, which it\nsoon after issued in coin at \u00a33:17:10 \u00bd an ounce, losing in this manner\nbetween two and a half and three per cent. upon the coinage of so very\nlarge a sum. Though the bank, therefore, paid no seignorage, though the\ngovernment was properly at the expense of this coinage, this liberality of\ngovernment did not prevent altogether the expense of the bank.\nThe Scotch banks, in consequence of an excess of the same kind, were all\nobliged to employ constantly agents at London to collect money for them,\nat an expense which was seldom below one and a half or two per cent. This\nmoney was sent down by the waggon, and insured by the carriers at an\nadditional expense of three quarters per cent. or fifteen shillings on the\nhundred pounds. Those agents were not always able to replenish the coffers\nof their employers so fast as they were emptied. In this case, the\nresource of the banks was, to draw upon their correspondents in London\nbills of exchange, to the extent of the sum which they wanted. When those\ncorrespondents afterwards drew upon them for the payment of this sum,\ntogether with the interest and commission, some of those banks, from the\ndistress into which their excessive circulation had thrown them, had\nsometimes no other means of satisfying this draught, but by drawing a\nsecond set of bills, either upon the same, or upon some other\ncorrespondents in London; and the same sum, or rather bills for the same\nsum, would in this manner make sometimes more than two or three journeys;\nthe debtor bank paying always the interest and commission upon the whole\naccumulated sum. Even those Scotch banks which never distinguished\nthemselves by their extreme imprudence, were sometimes obliged to employ\nthis ruinous resource.\nThe gold coin which was paid out, either by the Bank of England or by the\nScotch banks, in exchange for that part of their paper which was over and\nabove what could be employed in the circulation of the country, being\nlikewise over and above what could be employed in that circulation, was\nsometimes sent abroad in the shape of coin, sometimes melted down and sent\nabroad in the shape of bullion, and sometimes melted down and sold to the\nBank of England at the high price of four pounds an ounce. It was the\nnewest, the heaviest, and the best pieces only, which were carefully\npicked out of the whole coin, and either sent abroad or melted down. At\nhome, and while they remained in the shape of coin, those heavy pieces\nwere of no more value than the light; but they were of more value abroad,\nor when melted down into bullion at home. The Bank of England,\nnotwithstanding their great annual coinage, found, to their astonishment,\nthat there was every year the same scarcity of coin as there had been the\nyear before; and that, notwithstanding the great quantity of good and new\ncoin which was every year issued from the bank, the state of the coin,\ninstead of growing better and better, became every year worse and worse.\nEvery year they found themselves under the necessity of coining nearly the\nsame quantity of gold as they had coined the year before; and from the\ncontinual rise in the price of gold bullion, in consequence of the\ncontinual wearing and clipping of the coin, the expense of this great\nannual coinage became, every year, greater and greater. The Bank of\nEngland, it is to be observed, by supplying its own coffers with coin, is\nindirectly obliged to supply the whole kingdom, into which coin is\ncontinually flowing from those coffers in a great variety of ways.\nWhatever coin, therefore, was wanted to support this excessive circulation\nboth of Scotch and English paper money, whatever vacuities this excessive\ncirculation occasioned in the necessary coin of the kingdom, the Bank of\nEngland was obliged to supply them. The Scotch banks, no doubt, paid all\nof them very dearly for their own imprudence and inattention: but the Bank\nof England paid very dearly, not only for its own imprudence, but for the\nmuch greater imprudence of almost all the Scotch banks.\nThe over-trading of some bold projectors in both parts of the united\nkingdom, was the original cause of this excessive circulation of paper\nmoney.\nWhat a bank can with propriety advance to a merchant or undertaker of any\nkind, is not either the whole capital with which he trades, or even any\nconsiderable part of that capital; but that part of it only which he would\notherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money, for\nanswering occasional demands. If the paper money which the bank advances\nnever exceeds this value, it can never exceed the value of the gold and\nsilver which would necessarily circulate in the country if there was no\npaper money; it can never exceed the quantity which the circulation of the\ncountry can easily absorb and employ.\nWhen a bank discounts to a merchant a real bill of exchange, drawn by a\nreal creditor upon a real debtor, and which, as soon as it becomes due, is\nreally paid by that debtor; it only advances to him a part of the value\nwhich he would otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready\nmoney, for answering occasional demands. The payment of the bill, when it\nbecomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what it had advanced,\ntogether with the interest. The coffers of the bank, so far as its\ndealings are confined to such customers, resemble a water-pond, from\nwhich, though a stream is continually running out, yet another is\ncontinually running in, fully equal to that which runs out; so that,\nwithout any further care or attention, the pond keeps always equally, or\nvery near equally full. Little or no expense can ever be necessary for\nreplenishing the coffers of such a bank.\nA merchant, without over-trading, may frequently have occasion for a sum\nof ready money, even when he has no bills to discount. When a bank,\nbesides discounting his bills, advances him likewise, upon such occasions,\nsuch sums upon his cash account, and accepts of a piece-meal repayment, as\nthe money comes in from the occasional sale of his goods, upon the easy\nterms of the banking companies of Scotland; it dispenses him entirely from\nthe necessity of keeping any part of his stock by him unemployed and in\nready money for answering occasional demands. When such demands actually\ncome upon him, he can answer them sufficiently from his cash account. The\nbank, however, in dealing with such customers, ought to observe with great\nattention, whether, in the course of some short period (of four, five,\nsix, or eight months, for example), the sum of the repayments which it\ncommonly receives from them, is, or is not, fully equal to that of the\nadvances which it commonly makes to them. If, within the course of such\nshort periods, the sum of the repayments from certain customers is, upon\nmost occasions, fully equal to that of the advances, it may safely\ncontinue to deal with such customers. Though the stream which is in this\ncase continually running out from its coffers may be very large, that\nwhich is continually running into them must be at least equally large, so\nthat, without any further care or attention, those coffers are likely to\nbe always equally or very near equally full, and scarce ever to require\nany extraordinary expense to replenish them. If, on the contrary, the sum\nof the repayments from certain other customers, falls commonly very much\nshort of the advances which it makes to them, it cannot with any safety\ncontinue to deal with such customers, at least if they continue to deal\nwith it in this manner. The stream which is in this case continually\nrunning out from its coffers, is necessarily much larger than that which\nis continually running in; so that, unless they are replenished by some\ngreat and continual effort of expense, those coffers must soon be\nexhausted altogether.\nThe banking companies of Scotland, accordingly, were for a long time very\ncareful to require frequent and regular repayments from all their\ncustomers, and did not care to deal with any person, whatever might be his\nfortune or credit, who did not make, what they called, frequent and\nregular operations with them. By this attention, besides saving almost\nentirely the extraordinary expense of replenishing their coffers, they\ngained two other very considerable advantages.\nFirst, by this attention they were enabled to make some tolerable judgment\nconcerning the thriving or declining circumstances of their debtors,\nwithout being obliged to look out for any other evidence besides what\ntheir own books afforded them; men being, for the most part, either\nregular or irregular in their repayments, according as their circumstances\nare either thriving or declining. A private man who lends out his money to\nperhaps half a dozen or a dozen of debtors, may, either by himself or his\nagents, observe and inquire both constantly and carefully into the conduct\nand situation of each of them. But a banking company, which lends money to\nperhaps five hundred different people, and of which the attention is\ncontinually occupied by objects of a very different kind, can have no\nregular information concerning the conduct and circumstances of the\ngreater part of its debtors, beyond what its own books afford it. In\nrequiring frequent and regular repayments from all their customers, the\nbanking companies of Scotland had probably this advantage in view.\nSecondly, by this attention they secured themselves from the possibility\nof issuing more paper money than what the circulation of the country could\neasily absorb and employ. When they observed, that within moderate periods\nof time, the repayments of a particular customer were, upon most\noccasions, fully equal to the advances which they had made to him, they\nmight be assured that the paper money which they had advanced to him had\nnot, at any time, exceeded the quantity of gold and silver which he would\notherwise have been obliged to keep by him for answering occasional\ndemands; and that, consequently, the paper money, which they had\ncirculated by his means, had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold\nand silver which would have circulated in the country, had there been no\npaper money. The frequency, regularity, and amount of his repayments,\nwould sufficiently demonstrate that the amount of their advances had at no\ntime exceeded that part of his capital which he would otherwise have been\nobliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money, for answering\noccasional demands; that is, for the purpose of keeping the rest of his\ncapital in constant employment. It is this part of his capital only which,\nwithin moderate periods of time, is continually returning to every dealer\nin the shape of money, whether paper or coin, and continually going from\nhim in the same shape. If the advances of the bank had commonly exceeded\nthis part of his capital, the ordinary amount of his repayments could not,\nwithin moderate periods of time, have equalled the ordinary amount of its\nadvances. The stream which, by means of his dealings, was continually\nrunning into the coffers of the bank, could not have been equal to the\nstream which, by means of the same dealings was continually running out.\nThe advances of the bank paper, by exceeding the quantity of gold and\nsilver which, had there been no such advances, he would have been obliged\nto keep by him for answering occasional demands, might soon come to exceed\nthe whole quantity of gold and silver which ( the commerce being supposed\nthe same ) would have circulated in the country, had there been no paper\nmoney; and, consequently, to exceed the quantity which the circulation of\nthe country could easily absorb and employ; and the excess of this paper\nmoney would immediately have returned upon the bank, in order to be\nexchanged for gold and silver. This second advantage, though equally real,\nwas not, perhaps, so well understood by all the different banking\ncompanies in Scotland as the first.\nWhen, partly by the conveniency of discounting bills, and partly by that\nof cash accounts, the creditable traders of any country can be dispensed\nfrom the necessity of keeping any part of their stock by them unemployed,\nand in ready money, for answering occasional demands, they can reasonably\nexpect no farther assistance from hanks and bankers, who, when they have\ngone thus far, cannot, consistently with their own interest and safety, go\nfarther. A bank cannot, consistently with its own interest, advance to a\ntrader the whole, or even the greater part of the circulating capital with\nwhich he trades; because, though that capital is continually returning to\nhim in the shape of money, and going from him in the same shape, yet the\nwhole of the returns is too distant from the whole of the outgoings, and\nthe sum of his repayments could not equal the sum of his advances within\nsuch moderate periods of time as suit the conveniency of a bank. Still\nless could a bank afford to advance him any considerable part of his fixed\ncapital; of the capital which the undertaker of an iron forge, for\nexample, employs in erecting his forge and smelting-houses, his\nwork-houses, and warehouses, the dwelling-houses of his workmen, etc.; of\nthe capital which the undertaker of a mine employs in sinking his shafts,\nin erecting engines for drawing out the water, in making roads and\nwaggon-ways, etc.; of the capital which the person who undertakes to\nimprove land employs in clearing, draining, inclosing, manuring, and\nploughing waste and uncultivated fields; in building farmhouses, with all\ntheir necessary appendages of stables, granaries, etc. The returns of the\nfixed capital are, in almost all cases, much slower than those of the\ncirculating capital: and such expenses, even when laid out with the\ngreatest prudence and judgment, very seldom return to the undertaker till\nafter a period of many years, a period by far too distant to suit the\nconveniency of a bank. Traders and other undertakers may, no doubt with\ngreat propriety, carry on a very considerable part of their projects with\nborrowed money. In justice to their creditors, however, their own capital\nought in this case to be sufficient to insure, if I may say so, the\ncapital of those creditors; or to render it extremely improbable that\nthose creditors should incur any loss, even though the success of the\nproject should fall very much short of the expectation of the projectors.\nEven with this precaution, too, the money which is borrowed, and which it\nis meant should not be repaid till after a period of several years, ought\nnot to be borrowed of a bank, but ought to be borrowed upon bond or\nmortgage, of such private people as propose to live upon the interest of\ntheir money, without taking the trouble themselves to employ the capital,\nand who are, upon that account, willing to lend that capital to such\npeople of good credit as are likely to keep it for several years. A bank,\nindeed, which lends its money without the expense of stamped paper, or of\nattorneys\u2019 fees for drawing bonds and mortgages, and which accepts of\nrepayment upon the easy terms of the banking companies of Scotland, would,\nno doubt, be a very convenient creditor to such traders and undertakers.\nBut such traders and undertakers would surely be most inconvenient debtors\nto such a bank.\nIt is now more than five and twenty years since the paper money issued by\nthe different banking companies of Scotland was fully equal, or rather was\nsomewhat more than fully equal, to what the circulation of the country\ncould easily absorb and employ. Those companies, therefore, had so long\nago given all the assistance to the traders and other undertakers of\nScotland which it is possible for banks and bankers, consistently with\ntheir own interest, to give. They had even done somewhat more. They had\nover-traded a little, and had brought upon themselves that loss, or at\nleast that diminution of profit, which, in this particular business, never\nfails to attend the smallest degree of over-trading. Those traders and\nother undertakers, having got so much assistance from banks and bankers,\nwished to get still more. The banks, they seem to have thought, could\nextend their credits to whatever sum might be wanted, without incurring\nany other expense besides that of a few reams of paper. They complained of\nthe contracted views and dastardly spirit of the directors of those banks,\nwhich did not, they said, extend their credits in proportion to the\nextension of the trade of the country; meaning, no doubt, by the extension\nof that trade, the extension of their own projects beyond what they could\ncarry on either with their own capital, or with what they had credit to\nborrow of private people in the usual way of bond or mortgage. The banks,\nthey seem to have thought, were in honour bound to supply the deficiency,\nand to provide them with all the capital which they wanted to trade with.\nThe banks, however, were of a different opinion; and upon their refusing\nto extend their credits, some of those traders had recourse to an\nexpedient which, for a time, served their purpose, though at a much\ngreater expense, yet as effectually as the utmost extension of bank\ncredits could have done. This expedient was no other than the well known\nshift of drawing and redrawing; the shift to which unfortunate traders\nhave sometimes recourse, when they are upon the brink of bankruptcy. The\npractice of raising money in this manner had been long known in England;\nand, during the course of the late war, when the high profits of trade\nafforded a great temptation to over-trading, is said to have been carried\non to a very great extent. From England it was brought into Scotland,\nwhere, in proportion to the very limited commerce, and to the very\nmoderate capital of the country, it was soon carried on to a much greater\nextent than it ever had been in England.\nThe practice of drawing and redrawing is so well known to all men of\nbusiness, that it may, perhaps, be thought unnecessary to give any account\nof it. But as this book may come into the hands of many people who are not\nmen of business, and as the effects of this practice upon the banking\ntrade are not, perhaps, generally understood, even by men of business\nthemselves, I shall endeavour to explain it as distinctly as I can.\nThe customs of merchants, which were established when the barbarous laws\nof Europe did not enforce the performance of their contracts, and which,\nduring the course of the two last centuries, have been adopted into the\nlaws of all European nations, have given such extraordinary privileges to\nbills of exchange, that money is more readily advanced upon them than upon\nany other species of obligation; especially when they are made payable\nwithin so short a period as two or three months after their date. If, when\nthe bill becomes due, the acceptor does not pay it as soon as it is\npresented, he becomes from that moment a bankrupt. The bill is protested,\nand returns upon the drawer, who, if he does not immediately pay it,\nbecomes likewise a bankrupt. If, before it came to the person who presents\nit to the acceptor for payment, it had passed through the hands of several\nother persons, who had successively advanced to one another the contents\nof it, either in money or goods, and who, to express that each of them had\nin his turn received those contents, had all of them in their order\nindorsed, that is, written their names upon the back of the bill; each\nindorser becomes in his turn liable to the owner of the bill for those\ncontents, and, if he fails to pay, he becomes too, from that moment, a\nbankrupt. Though the drawer, acceptor, and indorsers of the bill, should\nall of them be persons of doubtful credit; yet, still the shortness of the\ndate gives some security to the owner of the bill. Though all of them may\nbe very likely to become bankrupts, it is a chance if they all become so\nin so short a time. The house is crazy, says a weary traveller to himself,\nand will not stand very long; but it is a chance if it falls to-night, and\nI will venture, therefore, to sleep in it to-night.\nThe trader A in Edinburgh, we shall suppose, draws a bill upon B in\nLondon, payable two months after date. In reality B in London owes nothing\nto A in Edinburgh; but he agrees to accept of A\u2019s bill, upon condition,\nthat before the term of payment he shall redraw upon A in Edinburgh for\nthe same sum, together with the interest and a commission, another bill,\npayable likewise two months after date. B accordingly, before the\nexpiration of the first two months, redraws this bill upon A in Edinburgh;\nwho, again before the expiration of the second two months, draws a second\nbill upon B in London, payable likewise two months after date; and before\nthe expiration of the third two months, B in London redraws upon A in\nEdinburgh another bill payable also two months after date. This practice\nhas sometimes gone on, not only for several months, but for several years\ntogether, the bill always returning upon A in Edinburgh with the\naccumulated interest and commission of all the former bills. The interest\nwas five per cent. in the year, and the commission was never less than one\nhalf per cent. on each draught. This commission being repeated more than\nsix times in the year, whatever money A might raise by this expedient\nmight necessarily have cost him something more than eight per cent. in the\nyear and sometimes a great deal more, when either the price of the\ncommission happened to rise, or when he was obliged to pay compound\ninterest upon the interest and commission of former bills. This practice\nwas called raising money by circulation.\nIn a country where the ordinary profits of stock, in the greater part of\nmercantile projects, are supposed to run between six and ten per cent. it\nmust have been a very fortunate speculation, of which the returns could\nnot only repay the enormous expense at which the money was thus borrowed\nfor carrying it on, but afford, besides, a good surplus profit to the\nprojector. Many vast and extensive projects, however, were undertaken, and\nfor several years carried on, without any other fund to support them\nbesides what was raised at this enormous expense. The projectors, no\ndoubt, had in their golden dreams the most distinct vision of this great\nprofit. Upon their awakening, however, either at the end of their\nprojects, or when they were no longer able to carry them on, they very\nseldom, I believe, had the good fortune to find it.\n{The method described in the text was by no means either the most common\nor the most expensive one in which those adventurers sometimes raised\nmoney by circulation. It frequently happened, that A in Edinburgh would\nenable B in London to pay the first bill of exchange, by drawing, a few\ndays before it became due, a second bill at three months date upon the\nsame B in London. This bill, being payable to his own order, A sold in\nEdinburgh at par; and with its contents purchased bills upon London,\npayable at sight to the order of B, to whom he sent them by the post.\nTowards the end of the late war, the exchange between Edinburgh and London\nwas frequently three per cent. against Edinburgh, and those bills at sight\nmust frequently have cost A that premium. This transaction, therefore,\nbeing repeated at least four times in the year, and being loaded with a\ncommission of at least one half per cent. upon each repetition, must at\nthat period have cost A, at least, fourteen per cent. in the year. At\nother times A would enable to discharge the first bill of exchange, by\ndrawing, a few days before it became due, a second bill at two months\ndate, not upon B, but upon some third person, C, for example, in London.\nThis other bill was made payable to the order of B, who, upon its being\naccepted by C, discounted it with some banker in London; and A enabled C\nto discharge it, by drawing, a few day\u2019s before it became due, a third\nbill likewise at two months date, sometimes upon his first correspondent\nB, and sometimes upon some fourth or fifth person, D or E, for example.\nThis third bill was made payable to the order of C, who, as soon as it was\naccepted, discounted it in the same manner with some banker in London.\nSuch operations being repeated at least six times in the year, and being\nloaded with a commission of at least one half per cent. upon each\nrepetition, together with the legal interest of five per cent. this method\nof raising money, in the same manner as that described in the text, must\nhave cost A something more than eight per cent. By saving, however, the\nexchange between Edinburgh and London, it was less expensive than that\nmentioned in the foregoing part of this note; but then it required an\nestablished credit with more houses than one in London, an advantage which\nmany of these adventurers could not always find it easy to procure.}\nThe bills which A in Edinburgh drew upon B in London, he regularly\ndiscounted two months before they were due, with some bank or banker in\nEdinburgh; and the bills which B in London redrew upon A in Edinburgh, he\nas regularly discounted, either with the Bank of England, or with some\nother banker in London. Whatever was advanced upon such circulating bills\nwas in Edinburgh advanced in the paper of the Scotch banks; and in London,\nwhen they were discounted at the Bank of England in the paper of that\nbank. Though the bills upon which this paper had been advanced were all of\nthem repaid in their turn as soon as they became due, yet the value which\nhad been really advanced upon the first bill was never really returned to\nthe banks which advanced it; because, before each bill became due, another\nbill was always drawn to somewhat a greater amount than the bill which was\nsoon to be paid: and the discounting of this other bill was essentially\nnecessary towards the payment of that which was soon to be due. This\npayment, therefore, was altogether fictitious. The stream which, by means\nof those circulating bills of exchange, had once been made to run out from\nthe coffers of the banks, was never replaced by any stream which really\nran into them.\nThe paper which was issued upon those circulating bills of exchange\namounted, upon many occasions, to the whole fund destined for carrying on\nsome vast and extensive project of agriculture, commerce, or manufactures;\nand not merely to that part of it which, had there been no paper money,\nthe projector would have been obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in\nready money, for answering occasional demands. The greater part of this\npaper was, consequently, over and above the value of the gold and silver\nwhich would have circulated in the country, had there been no paper money.\nIt was over and above, therefore, what the circulation of the country\ncould easily absorb and employ, and upon that account, immediately\nreturned upon the banks, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver,\nwhich they were to find as they could. It was a capital which those\nprojectors had very artfully contrived to draw from those banks, not only\nwithout their knowledge or deliberate consent, but for some time, perhaps,\nwithout their having the most distant suspicion that they had really\nadvanced it.\nWhen two people, who are continually drawing and redrawing upon one\nanother, discount their bills always with the same banker, he must\nimmediately discover what they are about, and see clearly that they are\ntrading, not with any capital of their own, but with the capital which he\nadvances to them. But this discovery is not altogether so easy when they\ndiscount their bills sometimes with one banker, and sometimes with\nanother, and when the two same persons do not constantly draw and redraw\nupon one another, but occasionally run the round of a great circle of\nprojectors, who find it for their interest to assist one another in this\nmethod of raising money and to render it, upon that account, as difficult\nas possible to distinguish between a real and a fictitious bill of\nexchange, between a bill drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor, and\na bill for which there was properly no real creditor but the bank which\ndiscounted it, nor any real debtor but the projector who made use of the\nmoney. When a banker had even made this discovery, he might sometimes make\nit too late, and might find that he had already discounted the bills of\nthose projectors to so great an extent, that, by refusing to discount any\nmore, he would necessarily make them all bankrupts; and thus by ruining\nthem, might perhaps ruin himself. For his own interest and safety,\ntherefore, he might find it necessary, in this very perilous situation, to\ngo on for some time, endeavouring, however, to withdraw gradually, and,\nupon that account, making every day greater and greater difficulties about\ndiscounting, in order to force these projectors by degrees to have\nrecourse, either to other bankers, or to other methods of raising money:\nso as that he himself might, as soon as possible, get out of the circle.\nThe difficulties, accordingly, which the Bank of England, which the\nprincipal bankers in London, and which even the more prudent Scotch banks\nbegan, after a certain time, and when all of them had already gone too\nfar, to make about discounting, not only alarmed, but enraged, in the\nhighest degree, those projectors. Their own distress, of which this\nprudent and necessary reserve of the banks was, no doubt, the immediate\noccasion, they called the distress of the country; and this distress of\nthe country, they said, was altogether owing to the ignorance,\npusillanimity, and bad conduct of the banks, which did not give a\nsufficiently liberal aid to the spirited undertakings of those who exerted\nthemselves in order to beautify, improve, and enrich the country. It was\nthe duty of the banks, they seemed to think, to lend for as long a time,\nand to as great an extent, as they might wish to borrow. The banks,\nhowever, by refusing in this manner to give more credit to those to whom\nthey had already given a great deal too much, took the only method by\nwhich it was now possible to save either their own credit, or the public\ncredit of the country.\nIn the midst of this clamour and distress, a new bank was established in\nScotland, for the express purpose of relieving the distress of the\ncountry. The design was generous; but the execution was imprudent, and the\nnature and causes of the distress which it meant to relieve, were not,\nperhaps, well understood. This bank was more liberal than any other had\never been, both in granting cash-accounts, and in discounting bills of\nexchange. With regard to the latter, it seems to have made scarce any\ndistinction between real and circulating bills, but to have discounted all\nequally. It was the avowed principle of this bank to advance upon any\nreasonable security, the whole capital which was to be employed in those\nimprovements of which the returns are the most slow and distant, such as\nthe improvements of land. To promote such improvements was even said to be\nthe chief of the public-spirited purposes for which it was instituted. By\nits liberality in granting cash-accounts, and in discounting bills of\nexchange, it, no doubt, issued great quantities of its bank notes. But\nthose bank notes being, the greater part of them, over and above what the\ncirculation of the country could easily absorb and employ, returned upon\nit, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver, as fast as they were\nissued. Its coffers were never well filled. The capital which had been\nsubscribed to this bank, at two different subscriptions, amounted to one\nhundred and sixty thousand pounds, of which eighty per cent. only was paid\nup. This sum ought to have been paid in at several different instalments.\nA great part of the proprietors, when they paid in their first instalment,\nopened a cash-account with the bank; and the directors, thinking\nthemselves obliged to treat their own proprietors with the same liberality\nwith which they treated all other men, allowed many of them to borrow upon\nthis cash-account what they paid in upon all their subsequent instalments.\nSuch payments, therefore, only put into one coffer what had the moment\nbefore been taken out of another. But had the coffers of this bank been\nfilled ever so well, its excessive circulation must have emptied them\nfaster than they could have been replenished by any other expedient but\nthe ruinous one of drawing upon London; and when the bill became due,\npaying it, together with interest and commission, by another draught upon\nthe same place. Its coffers having been filled so very ill, it is said to\nhave been driven to this resource within a very few months after it began\nto do business. The estates of the proprietors of this bank were worth\nseveral millions, and, by their subscription to the original bond or\ncontract of the bank, were really pledged for answering all its\nengagements. By means of the great credit which so great a pledge\nnecessarily gave it, it was, notwithstanding its too liberal conduct,\nenabled to carry on business for more than two years. When it was obliged\nto stop, it had in the circulation about two hundred thousand pounds in\nbank notes. In order to support the circulation of those notes, which were\ncontinually returning upon it as fast as they were issued, it had been\nconstantly in the practice of drawing bills of exchange upon London, of\nwhich the number and value were continually increasing, and, when it\nstopt, amounted to upwards of six hundred thousand pounds. This bank,\ntherefore, had, in little more than the course of two years, advanced to\ndifferent people upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds at five per\ncent. Upon the two hundred thousand pounds which it circulated in bank\nnotes, this five per cent. might perhaps be considered as a clear gain,\nwithout any other deduction besides the expense of management. But upon\nupwards of six hundred thousand pounds, for which it was continually\ndrawing bills of exchange upon London, it was paying, in the way of\ninterest and commission, upwards of eight per cent. and was consequently\nlosing more than three per cent. upon more than three fourths of all its\ndealings.\nThe operations of this bank seem to have produced effects quite opposite\nto those which were intended by the particular persons who planned and\ndirected it. They seem to have intended to support the spirited\nundertakings, for as such they considered them, which were at that time\ncarrying on in different parts of the country; and, at the same time, by\ndrawing the whole banking business to themselves, to supplant all the\nother Scotch banks, particularly those established at Edinburgh, whose\nbackwardness in discounting bills of exchange had given some offence. This\nbank, no doubt, gave some temporary relief to those projectors, and\nenabled them to carry on their projects for about two years longer than\nthey could otherwise have done. But it thereby only enabled them to get so\nmuch deeper into debt; so that, when ruin came, it fell so much the\nheavier both upon them and upon their creditors. The operations of this\nbank, therefore, instead of relieving, in reality aggravated in the\nlong-run the distress which those projectors had brought both upon\nthemselves and upon their country. It would have been much better for\nthemselves, their creditors, and their country, had the greater part of\nthem been obliged to stop two years sooner than they actually did. The\ntemporary relief, however, which this bank afforded to those projectors,\nproved a real and permanent relief to the other Scotch banks. All the\ndealers in circulating bills of exchange, which those other banks had\nbecome so backward in discounting, had recourse to this new bank, where\nthey were received with open arms. Those other banks, therefore, were\nenabled to get very easily out of that fatal circle, from which they could\nnot otherwise have disengaged themselves without incurring a considerable\nloss, and perhaps, too, even some degree of discredit.\nIn the long-run, therefore, the operations of this bank increased the real\ndistress of the country, which it meant to relieve; and effectually\nrelieved, from a very great distress, those rivals whom it meant to\nsupplant.\nAt the first setting out of this bank, it was the opinion of some people,\nthat how fast soever its coffers might be emptied, it might easily\nreplenish them, by raising money upon the securities of those to whom it\nhad advanced its paper. Experience, I believe, soon convinced them that\nthis method of raising money was by much too slow to answer their purpose;\nand that coffers which originally were so ill filled, and which emptied\nthemselves so very fast, could be replenished by no other expedient but\nthe ruinous one of drawing bills upon London, and when they became due,\npaying them by other draughts on the same place, with accumulated interest\nand commission. But though they had been able by this method to raise\nmoney as fast as they wanted it, yet, instead of making a profit, they\nmust have suffered a loss of every such operation; so that in the long-run\nthey must have ruined themselves as a mercantile company, though perhaps\nnot so soon as by the more expensive practice of drawing and redrawing.\nThey could still have made nothing by the interest of the paper, which,\nbeing over and above what the circulation of the country could absorb and\nemploy, returned upon them in order to be exchanged for gold and silver,\nas fast as they issued it; and for the payment of which they were\nthemselves continually obliged to borrow money. On the contrary, the whole\nexpense of this borrowing, of employing agents to look out for people who\nhad money to lend, of negotiating with those people, and of drawing the\nproper bond or assignment, must have fallen upon them, and have been so\nmuch clear loss upon the balance of their accounts. The project of\nreplenishing their coffers in this manner may be compared to that of a man\nwho had a water-pond from which a stream was continually running out, and\ninto which no stream was continually running, but who proposed to keep it\nalways equally full, by employing a number of people to go continually\nwith buckets to a well at some miles distance, in order to bring water to\nreplenish it.\nBut though this operation had proved not only practicable, but profitable\nto the bank, as a mercantile company; yet the country could have derived\nno benefit front it, but, on the contrary, must have suffered a very\nconsiderable loss by it. This operation could not augment, in the smallest\ndegree, the quantity of money to be lent. It could only have erected this\nbank into a sort of general loan office for the whole country. Those who\nwanted to borrow must have applied to this bank, instead of applying to\nthe private persons who had lent it their money. But a bank which lends\nmoney, perhaps to five hundred different people, the greater part of whom\nits directors can know very little about, is not likely to be more\njudicious in the choice of its debtors than a private person who lends out\nhis money among a few people whom he knows, and in whose sober and frugal\nconduct he thinks he has good reason to confide. The debtors of such a\nbank as that whose conduct I have been giving some account of were likely,\nthe greater part of them, to be chimerical projectors, the drawers and\nredrawers of circulating bills of exchange, who would employ the money in\nextravagant undertakings, which, with all the assistance that could be\ngiven them, they would probably never be able to complete, and which, if\nthey should be completed, would never repay the expense which they had\nreally cost, would never afford a fund capable of maintaining a quantity\nof labour equal to that which had been employed about them. The sober and\nfrugal debtors of private persons, on the contrary, would be more likely\nto employ the money borrowed in sober undertakings which were proportioned\nto their capitals, and which, though they might have less of the grand and\nthe marvellous, would have more of the solid and the profitable; which\nwould repay with a large profit whatever had been laid out upon them, and\nwhich would thus afford a fund capable of maintaining a much greater\nquantity of labour than that which had been employed about them. The\nsuccess of this operation, therefore, without increasing in the smallest\ndegree the capital of the country, would only have transferred a great\npart of it from prudent and profitable to imprudent and unprofitable\nundertakings.\nThat the industry of Scotland languished for want of money to employ it,\nwas the opinion of the famous Mr Law. By establishing a bank of a\nparticular kind, which he seems to have imagined might issue paper to the\namount of the whole value of all the lands in the country, he proposed to\nremedy this want of money. The parliament of Scotland, when he first\nproposed his project, did not think proper to adopt it. It was afterwards\nadopted, with some variations, by the Duke of Orleans, at that time regent\nof France. The idea of the possibility of multiplying paper money to\nalmost any extent was the real foundation of what is called the\nMississippi scheme, the most extravagant project, both of banking and\nstock-jobbing, that perhaps the world ever saw. The different operations\nof this scheme are explained so fully, so clearly, and with so much order\nand distinctness, by Mr Du Verney, in his Examination of the Political\nReflections upon commerce and finances of Mr Du Tot, that I shall not give\nany account of them. The principles upon which it was founded are\nexplained by Mr Law himself, in a discourse concerning money and trade,\nwhich he published in Scotland when he first proposed his project. The\nsplendid but visionary ideas which are set forth in that and some other\nworks upon the same principles, still continue to make an impression upon\nmany people, and have, perhaps, in part, contributed to that excess of\nbanking, which has of late been complained of, both in Scotland and in\nother places.\nThe Bank of England is the greatest bank of circulation in Europe. It was\nincorporated, in pursuance of an act of parliament, by a charter under the\ngreat seal, dated the 27th of July 1694. It at that time advanced to\ngovernment the sum of \u00a31,200,000 for an annuity of \u00a3100,000, or for \u00a3\n96,000 a-year, interest at the rate of eight per cent. and \u00a34,000 a-year for\nthe expense of management. The credit of the new government, established\nby the Revolution, we may believe, must have been very low, when it was\nobliged to borrow at so high an interest.\nIn 1697, the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital stock, by an\ningraftment of \u00a31,001,171:10s. Its whole capital stock, therefore,\namounted at this time to \u00a32,201,171: 10s. This ingraftment is said to have\nbeen for the support of public credit. In 1696, tallies had been at forty,\nand fifty, and sixty, per cent. discount, and bank notes at twenty per\ncent. {James Postlethwaite\u2019s History of the Public Revenue, p.301.} During\nthe great re-coinage of the silver, which was going on at this time, the\nbank had thought proper to discontinue the payment of its notes, which\nnecessarily occasioned their discredit.\nIn pursuance of the 7th Anne, c. 7, the bank advanced and paid into the\nexchequer the sum of \u00a3400,000; making in all the sum of \u00a31,600,000, which\nit had advanced upon its original annuity of \u00a396,000 interest, and \u00a34,000\nfor expense of management. In 1708, therefore, the credit of government\nwas as good as that of private persons, since it could borrow at six per\ncent. interest, the common legal and market rate of those times. In\npursuance of the same act, the bank cancelled exchequer bills to the\namount of \u00a3 1,775,027: 17s: 10\u00bdd. at six per cent. interest, and was at\nthe same time allowed to take in subscriptions for doubling its capital.\nIn 1703, therefore, the capital of the bank amounted to \u00a34,402,343; and it\nhad advanced to government the sum of \u00a33,375,027:17:10\u00bdd.\nBy a call of fifteen per cent. in 1709, there was paid in, and made stock,\n\u00a3 656,204:1:9d.; and by another of ten per cent. in 1710, \u00a3501,448:12:11d.\nIn consequence of those two calls, therefore, the bank capital amounted to\n\u00a3 5,559,995:14:8d.\nIn pursuance of the 3rd George I. c.8, the bank delivered up two millions\nof exchequer Bills to be cancelled. It had at this time, therefore,\nadvanced to government \u00a35,375,027:17 10d. In pursuance of the 8th George\nI. c.21, the bank purchased of the South-sea company, stock to the amount\nof \u00a34,000,000: and in 1722, in consequence of the subscriptions which it\nhad taken in for enabling it to make this purchase, its capital stock was\nincreased by \u00a3 3,400,000. At this time, therefore, the bank had advanced\nto the public \u00a3 9,375,027 17s. 10\u00bdd.; and its capital stock amounted only\nto \u00a3 8,959,995:14:8d. It was upon this occasion that the sum which the\nbank had advanced to the public, and for which it received interest, began\nfirst to exceed its capital stock, or the sum for which it paid a dividend\nto the proprietors of bank stock; or, in other words, that the bank began\nto have an undivided capital, over and above its divided one. It has\ncontinued to have an undivided capital of the same kind ever since. In\n1746, the bank had, upon different occasions, advanced to the public\n\u00a311,686,800, and its divided capital had been raised by different calls\nand subscriptions to \u00a3 10,780,000. The state of those two sums has\ncontinued to be the same ever since. In pursuance of the 4th of George\nIII. c.25, the bank agreed to pay to government for the renewal of its\ncharter \u00a3110,000, without interest or re-payment. This sum, therefore did\nnot increase either of those two other sums.\nThe dividend of the bank has varied according to the variations in the\nrate of the interest which it has, at different times, received for the\nmoney it had advanced to the public, as well as according to other\ncircumstances. This rate of interest has gradually been reduced from eight\nto three per cent. For some years past, the bank dividend has been at five\nand a half per cent.\nThe stability of the bank of England is equal to that of the British\ngovernment. All that it has advanced to the public must be lost before its\ncreditors can sustain any loss. No other banking company in England can be\nestablished by act of parliament, or can consist of more than six members.\nIt acts, not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of state. It\nreceives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the\ncreditors of the public; it circulates exchequer bills; and it advances to\ngovernment the annual amount of the land and malt taxes, which are\nfrequently not paid up till some years thereafter. In these different\noperations, its duty to the public may sometimes have obliged it, without\nany fault of its directors, to overstock the circulation with paper money.\nIt likewise discounts merchants\u2019 bills, and has, upon several different\noccasions, supported the credit of the principal houses, not only of\nEngland, but of Hamburgh and Holland. Upon one occasion, in 1763, it is\nsaid to have advanced for this purpose, in one week, about \u00a31,600,000, a\ngreat part of it in bullion. I do not, however, pretend to warrant either\nthe greatness of the sum, or the shortness of the time. Upon other\noccasions, this great company has been reduced to the necessity of paying\nin sixpences.\nIt is not by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a\ngreater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwise be\nso, that the most judicious operations of banking can increase the\nindustry of the country. That part of his capital which a dealer is\nobliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money, for answering\noccasional demands, is so much dead stock, which, so long as it remains in\nthis situation, produces nothing, either to him or to his country. The\njudicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead stock into\nactive and productive stock; into materials to work upon; into tools to\nwork with; and into provisions and subsistence to work for; into stock\nwhich produces something both to himself and to his country. The gold and\nsilver money which circulates in any country, and by means of which, the\nproduce of its land and labour is annually circulated and distributed to\nthe proper consumers, is, in the same manner as the ready money of the\ndealer, all dead stock. It is a very valuable part of the capital of the\ncountry, which produces nothing to the country. The judicious operations\nof banking, by substituting paper in the room of a great part of this gold\nand silver, enable the country to convert a great part of this dead stock\ninto active and productive stock; into stock which produces something to\nthe country. The gold and silver money which circulates in any country may\nvery properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and\ncarries to market all the grass and corn of the country, produces itself\nnot a single pile of either. The judicious operations of banking, by\nproviding, if I may be allowed so violent a metaphor, a sort of waggon-way\nthrough the air, enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part\nof its highways into good pastures, and corn fields, and thereby to\nincrease, very considerably, the annual produce of its land and labour.\nThe commerce and industry of the country, however, it must be\nacknowledged, though they may be somewhat augmented, cannot be altogether\nso secure, when they are thus, as it were, suspended upon the Daedalian\nwings of paper money, as when they travel about upon the solid ground of\ngold and silver. Over and above the accidents to which they are exposed\nfrom the unskilfulness of the conductors of this paper money, they are\nliable to several others, from which no prudence or skill of those\nconductors can guard them.\nAn unsuccessful war, for example, in which the enemy got possession of the\ncapital, and consequently of that treasure which supported the credit of\nthe paper money, would occasion a much greater confusion in a country\nwhere the whole circulation was carried on by paper, than in one where the\ngreater part of it was carried on by gold and silver. The usual instrument\nof commerce having lost its value, no exchanges could be made but either\nby barter or upon credit. All taxes having been usually paid in paper\nmoney, the prince would not have wherewithal either to pay his troops, or\nto furnish his magazines; and the state of the country would be much more\nirretrievable than if the greater part of its circulation had consisted in\ngold and silver. A prince, anxious to maintain his dominions at all times\nin the state in which he can most easily defend them, ought upon this\naccount to guard not only against that excessive multiplication of paper\nmoney which ruins the very banks which issue it, but even against that\nmultiplication of it which enables them to fill the greater part of the\ncirculation of the country with it.\nThe circulation of every country may be considered as divided into two\ndifferent branches; the circulation of the dealers with one another, and\nthe circulation between the dealers and the consumers. Though the same\npieces of money, whether paper or metal, may be employed sometimes in the\none circulation and sometimes in the other; yet as both are constantly\ngoing on at the same time, each requires a certain stock of money, of one\nkind or another, to carry it on. The value of the goods circulated between\nthe different dealers never can exceed the value of those circulated\nbetween the dealers and the consumers; whatever is bought by the dealers\nbeing ultimately destined to be sold to the consumers. The circulation\nbetween the dealers, as it is carried on by wholesale, requires generally\na pretty large sum for every particular transaction. That between the\ndealers and the consumers, on the contrary, as it is generally carried on\nby retail, frequently requires but very small ones, a shilling, or even a\nhalfpenny, being often sufficient. But small sums circulate much faster\nthan large ones. A shilling changes masters more frequently than a guinea,\nand a halfpenny more frequently than a shilling. Though the annual\npurchases of all the consumers, therefore, are at least equal in value to\nthose of all the dealers, they can generally be transacted with a much\nsmaller quantity of money; the same pieces, by a more rapid circulation,\nserving as the instrument of many more purchases of the one kind than of\nthe other.\nPaper money may be so regulated as either to confine itself very much to\nthe circulation between the different dealers, or to extend itself\nlikewise to a great part of that between the dealers and the consumers.\nWhere no bank notes are circulated under \u00a310 value, as in London, paper\nmoney confines itself very much to the circulation between the dealers.\nWhen a ten pound bank note comes into the hands of a consumer, he is\ngenerally obliged to change it at the first shop where he has occasion to\npurchase five shillings worth of goods; so that it often returns into the\nhands of a dealer before the consumer has spent the fortieth part of the\nmoney. Where bank notes are issued for so small sums as 20s. as in\nScotland, paper money extends itself to a considerable part of the\ncirculation between dealers and consumers. Before the Act of parliament\nwhich put a stop to the circulation of ten and five shilling notes, it\nfilled a still greater part of that circulation. In the currencies of\nNorth America, paper was commonly issued for so small a sum as a shilling,\nand filled almost the whole of that circulation. In some paper currencies\nof Yorkshire, it was issued even for so small a sum as a sixpence.\nWhere the issuing of bank notes for such very small sums is allowed, and\ncommonly practised, many mean people are both enabled and encouraged to\nbecome bankers. A person whose promissory note for \u00a35, or even for 20s.\nwould be rejected by every body, will get it to be received without\nscruple when it is issued for so small a sum as a sixpence. But the\nfrequent bankruptcies to which such beggarly bankers must be liable, may\noccasion a very considerable inconveniency, and sometimes even a very\ngreat calamity, to many poor people who had received their notes in\npayment.\nIt were better, perhaps, that no bank notes were issued in any part of the\nkingdom for a smaller sum than \u00a35. Paper money would then, probably,\nconfine itself, in every part of the kingdom, to the circulation between\nthe different dealers, as much as it does at present in London, where no\nbank notes are issued under \u00a310 value; \u00a35 being, in most part of the\nkingdom, a sum which, though it will purchase, perhaps, little more than\nhalf the quantity of goods, is as much considered, and is as seldom spent\nall at once, as \u00a310 are amidst the profuse expense of London.\nWhere paper money, it is to be observed, is pretty much confined to the\ncirculation between dealers and dealers, as at London, there is always\nplenty of gold and silver. Where it extends itself to a considerable part\nof the circulation between dealers and consumers, as in Scotland, and\nstill more in North America, it banishes gold and silver almost entirely\nfrom the country; almost all the ordinary transactions of its interior\ncommerce being thus carried on by paper. The suppression of ten and five\nshilling bank notes, somewhat relieved the scarcity of gold and silver in\nScotland; and the suppression of twenty shilling notes will probably\nrelieve it still more. Those metals are said to have become more abundant\nin America, since the suppression of some of their paper currencies. They\nare said, likewise, to have been more abundant before the institution of\nthose currencies.\nThough paper money should be pretty much confined to the circulation\nbetween dealers and dealers, yet banks and bankers might still be able to\ngive nearly the same assistance to the industry and commerce of the\ncountry, as they had done when paper money filled almost the whole\ncirculation. The ready money which a dealer is obliged to keep by him, for\nanswering occasional demands, is destined altogether for the circulation\nbetween himself and other dealers of whom he buys goods. He has no\noccasion to keep any by him for the circulation between himself and the\nconsumers, who are his customers, and who bring ready money to him,\ninstead of taking any from him. Though no paper money, therefore, was\nallowed to be issued, but for such sums as would confine it pretty much to\nthe circulation between dealers and dealers; yet partly by discounting\nreal bills of exchange, and partly by lending upon cash-accounts, banks\nand bankers might still be able to relieve the greater part of those\ndealers from the necessity of keeping any considerable part of their stock\nby them unemployed, and in ready money, for answering occasional demands.\nThey might still be able to give the utmost assistance which banks and\nbankers can with propriety give to traders of every kind.\nTo restrain private people, it may be said, from receiving in payment the\npromissory notes of a banker for any sum, whether great or small, when\nthey themselves are willing to receive them; or, to restrain a banker from\nissuing such notes, when all his neighbours are willing to accept of them,\nis a manifest violation of that natural liberty, which it is the proper\nbusiness of law not to infringe, but to support. Such regulations may, no\ndoubt, be considered as in some respect a violation of natural liberty.\nBut those exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which\nmight endanger the security of the whole society, are, and ought to be,\nrestrained by the laws of all governments; of the most free, as well as or\nthe most despotical. The obligation of building party walls, in order to\nprevent the communication of fire, is a violation of natural liberty,\nexactly of the same kind with the regulations of the banking trade which\nare here proposed.\nA paper money, consisting in bank notes, issued by people of undoubted\ncredit, payable upon demand, without any condition, and, in fact, always\nreadily paid as soon as presented, is, in every respect, equal in value to\ngold and silver money, since gold and silver money can at anytime be had\nfor it. Whatever is either bought or sold for such paper, must necessarily\nbe bought or sold as cheap as it could have been for gold and silver.\nThe increase of paper money, it has been said, by augmenting the quantity,\nand consequently diminishing the value, of the whole currency, necessarily\naugments the money price of commodities. But as the quantity of gold and\nsilver, which is taken from the currency, is always equal to the quantity\nof paper which is added to it, paper money does not necessarily increase\nthe quantity of the whole currency. From the beginning of the last century\nto the present time, provisions never were cheaper in Scotland than in\n1759, though, from the circulation of ten and five shilling bank notes,\nthere was then more paper money in the country than at present. The\nproportion between the price of provisions in Scotland and that in England\nis the same now as before the great multiplication of banking companies in\nScotland. Corn is, upon most occasions, fully as cheap in England as in\nFrance, though there is a great deal of paper money in England, and scarce\nany in France. In 1751 and 1752, when Mr Hume published his Political\nDiscourses, and soon after the great multiplication of paper money in\nScotland, there was a very sensible rise in the price of provisions,\nowing, probably, to the badness of the seasons, and not to the\nmultiplication of paper money.\nIt would be otherwise, indeed, with a paper money, consisting in\npromissory notes, of which the immediate payment depended, in any respect,\neither upon the good will of those who issued them, or upon a condition\nwhich the holder of the notes might not always have it in his power to\nfulfil, or of which the payment was not exigible till after a certain\nnumber of years, and which, in the mean time, bore no interest. Such a\npaper money would, no doubt, fall more or less below the value of gold and\nsilver, according as the difficulty or uncertainty of obtaining immediate\npayment was supposed to be greater or less, or according to the greater or\nless distance of time at which payment was exigible.\nSome years ago the different banking companies of Scotland were in the\npractice of inserting into their bank notes, what they called an optional\nclause; by which they promised payment to the bearer, either as soon as\nthe note should be presented, or, in the option of the directors, six\nmonths after such presentment, together with the legal interest for the\nsaid six months. The directors of some of those banks sometimes took\nadvantage of this optional clause, and sometimes threatened those who\ndemanded gold and silver in exchange for a considerable number of their\nnotes, that they would take advantage of it, unless such demanders would\ncontent themselves with a part of what they demanded. The promissory notes\nof those banking companies constituted, at that time, the far greater part\nof the currency of Scotland, which this uncertainty of payment necessarily\ndegraded below value of gold and silver money. During the continuance of\nthis abuse (which prevailed chiefly in 1762, 1763, and 1764), while the\nexchange between London and Carlisle was at par, that between London and\nDumfries would sometimes be four per cent. against Dumfries, though this\ntown is not thirty miles distant from Carlisle. But at Carlisle, bills\nwere paid in gold and silver; whereas at Dumfries they were paid in Scotch\nbank notes; and the uncertainty of getting these bank notes exchanged for\ngold and silver coin, had thus degraded them four per cent. below the\nvalue of that coin. The same act of parliament which suppressed ten and\nfive shilling bank notes, suppressed likewise this optional clause, and\nthereby restored the exchange between England and Scotland to its natural\nrate, or to what the course of trade and remittances might happen to make\nit.\nIn the paper currencies of Yorkshire, the payment of so small a sum as 6d.\nsometimes depended upon the condition, that the holder of the note should\nbring the change of a guinea to the person who issued it; a condition\nwhich the holders of such notes might frequently find it very difficult to\nfulfil, and which must have degraded this currency below the value of gold\nand silver money. An act of parliament, accordingly, declared all such\nclauses unlawful, and suppressed, in the same manner as in Scotland, all\npromissory notes, payable to the bearer, under 20s. value.\nThe paper currencies of North America consisted, not in bank notes payable\nto the bearer on demand, but in a government paper, of which the payment\nwas not exigible till several years after it was issued; and though the\ncolony governments paid no interest to the holders of this paper, they\ndeclared it to be, and in fact rendered it, a legal tender of payment for\nthe full value for which it was issued. But allowing the colony security\nto be perfectly good, \u00a3100, payable fifteen years hence, for example, in a\ncountry where interest is at six per cent., is worth little more than \u00a340\nready money. To oblige a creditor, therefore, to accept of this as full\npayment for a debt of \u00a3100, actually paid down in ready money, was an act\nof such violent injustice, as has scarce, perhaps, been attempted by the\ngovernment of any other country which pretended to be free. It bears the\nevident marks of having originally been, what the honest and downright\nDoctor Douglas assures us it was, a scheme of fraudulent debtors to cheat\ntheir creditors. The government of Pennsylvania, indeed, pretended, upon\ntheir first emission of paper money, in 1722, to render their paper of\nequal value with gold and silver, by enacting penalties against all those\nwho made any difference in the price of their goods when they sold them\nfor a colony paper, and when they sold them for gold and silver, a\nregulation equally tyrannical, but much less, effectual, than that which\nit was meant to support. A positive law may render a shilling a legal\ntender for a guinea, because it may direct the courts of justice to\ndischarge the debtor who has made that tender; but no positive law can\noblige a person who sells goods, and who is at liberty to sell or not to\nsell as he pleases, to accept of a shilling as equivalent to a guinea in\nthe price of them. Notwithstanding any regulation of this kind, it\nappeared, by the course of exchange with Great Britain, that \u00a3100 sterling\nwas occasionally considered as equivalent, in some of the colonies, to\n\u00a3130, and in others to so great a sum as \u00a31100 currency; this difference\nin the value arising from the difference in the quantity of paper emitted\nin the different colonies, and in the distance and probability of the term\nof its final discharge and redemption.\nNo law, therefore, could be more equitable than the act of parliament, so\nunjustly complained of in the colonies, which declared, that no paper\ncurrency to be emitted there in time coming, should be a legal tender of\npayment.\nPennsylvania was always more moderate in its emissions of paper money than\nany other of our colonies. Its paper currency, accordingly, is said never\nto have sunk below the value of the gold and silver which was current in\nthe colony before the first emission of its paper money. Before that\nemission, the colony had raised the denomination of its coin, and had, by\nact of assembly, ordered 5s. sterling to pass in the colonies for 6s:3d.,\nand afterwards for 6s:8d. A pound, colony currency, therefore, even when\nthat currency was gold and silver, was more than thirty per cent. below\nthe value of \u00a31 sterling; and when that currency was turned into paper, it\nwas seldom much more than thirty per cent. below that value. The pretence\nfor raising the denomination of the coin was to prevent the exportation of\ngold and silver, by making equal quantities of those metals pass for\ngreater sums in the colony than they did in the mother country. It was\nfound, however, that the price of all goods from the mother country rose\nexactly in proportion as they raised the denomination of their coin, so\nthat their gold and silver were exported as fast as ever.\nThe paper of each colony being received in the payment of the provincial\ntaxes, for the full value for which it had been issued, it necessarily\nderived from this use some additional value, over and above what it would\nhave had, from the real or supposed distance of the term of its final\ndischarge and redemption. This additional value was greater or less,\naccording as the quantity of paper issued was more or less above what\ncould be employed in the payment of the taxes of the particular colony\nwhich issued it. It was in all the colonies very much above what could be\nemployed in this manner.\nA prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should\nbe paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain\nvalue to this paper money, even though the term of its final discharge and\nredemption should depend altogether upon the will of the prince. If the\nbank which issued this paper was careful to keep the quantity of it always\nsomewhat below what could easily be employed in this manner, the demand\nfor it might be such as to make it even bear a premium, or sell for\nsomewhat more in the market than the quantity of gold or silver currency\nfor which it was issued. Some people account in this manner for what is\ncalled the agio of the bank of Amsterdam, or for the superiority of bank\nmoney over current money, though this bank money, as they pretend, cannot\nbe taken out of the bank at the will of the owner. The greater part of\nforeign bills of exchange must be paid in bank money, that is, by a\ntransfer in the books of the bank; and the directors of the bank, they\nallege, are careful to keep the whole quantity of bank money always below\nwhat this use occasions a demand for. It is upon this account, they say,\nthe bank money sells for a premium, or bears an agio of four or five per\ncent. above the same nominal sum of the gold and silver currency of the\ncountry. This account of the bank of Amsterdam, however, it will appear\nhereafter, is in a great measure chimerical.\nA paper currency which falls below the value of gold and silver coin, does\nnot thereby sink the value of those metals, or occasion equal quantities\nof them to exchange for a smaller quantity of goods of any other kind. The\nproportion between the value of gold and silver and that of goods of any\nother kind, depends in all cases, not upon the nature and quantity of any\nparticular paper money, which may be current in any particular country,\nbut upon the richness or poverty of the mines, which happen at any\nparticular time to supply the great market of the commercial world with\nthose metals. It depends upon the proportion between the quantity of\nlabour which is necessary in order to bring a certain quantity of gold and\nsilver to market, and that which is necessary in order to bring thither a\ncertain quantity of any other sort of goods.\nIf bankers are restrained from issuing any circulating bank notes, or\nnotes payable to the bearer, for less than a certain sum; and if they are\nsubjected to the obligation of an immediate and unconditional payment of\nsuch bank notes as soon as presented, their trade may, with safety to the\npublic, be rendered in all other respects perfectly free. The late\nmultiplication of banking companies in both parts of the united kingdom,\nan event by which many people have been much alarmed, instead of\ndiminishing, increases the security of the public. It obliges all of them\nto be more circumspect in their conduct, and, by not extending their\ncurrency beyond its due proportion to their cash, to guard themselves\nagainst those malicious runs, which the rivalship of so many competitors\nis always ready to bring upon them. It restrains the circulation of each\nparticular company within a narrower circle, and reduces their circulating\nnotes to a smaller number. By dividing the whole circulation into a\ngreater number of parts, the failure of any one company, an accident\nwhich, in the course of things, must sometimes happen, becomes of less\nconsequence to the public. This free competition, too, obliges all bankers\nto be more liberal in their dealings with their customers, lest their\nrivals should carry them away. In general, if any branch of trade, or any\ndivision of labour, be advantageous to the public, the freer and more\ngeneral the competition, it will always be the more so.\nCHAPTER III.\nOF THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL, OR OF\nPRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOUR.\nThere is one sort of labour which adds to the value of the subject upon\nwhich it is bestowed; there is another which has no such effect. The\nformer as it produces a value, may be called productive, the latter,\nunproductive labour. {Some French authors of great learning and ingenuity\nhave used those words in a different sense. In the last chapter of the\nfourth book, I shall endeavour to shew that their sense is an improper\none.} Thus the labour of a manufacturer adds generally to the value of the\nmaterials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance, and of his\nmaster\u2019s profit. The labour of a menial servant, on the contrary, adds to\nthe value of nothing. Though the manufacturer has his wages advanced to\nhim by his master, he in reality costs him no expense, the value of those\nwages being generally restored, together with a profit, in the improved\nvalue of the subject upon which his labour is bestowed. But the\nmaintenance of a menial servant never is restored. A man grows rich by\nemploying a multitude of manufacturers; he grows poor by maintaining a\nmultitude or menial servants. The labour of the latter, however, has its\nvalue, and deserves its reward as well as that of the former. But the\nlabour of the manufacturer fixes and realizes itself in some particular\nsubject or vendible commodity, which lasts for some time at least after\nthat labour is past. It is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour\nstocked and stored up, to be employed, if necessary, upon some other\noccasion. That subject, or, what is the same thing, the price of that\nsubject, can afterwards, if necessary, put into motion a quantity of\nlabour equal to that which had originally produced it. The labour of the\nmenial servant, on the contrary, does not fix or realize itself in any\nparticular subject or vendible commodity. His services generally perish in\nthe very instant of their performance, and seldom leave any trace of value\nbehind them, for which an equal quantity of service could afterwards be\nprocured.\nThe labour of some of the most respectable orders in the society is, like\nthat of menial servants, unproductive of any value, and does not fix or\nrealize itself in any permanent subject, or vendible commodity, which\nendures after that labour is past, and for which an equal quantity of\nlabour could afterwards be procured. The sovereign, for example, with all\nthe officers both of justice and war who serve under him, the whole army\nand navy, are unproductive labourers. They are the servants of the public,\nand are maintained by a part of the annual produce of the industry of\nother people. Their service, how honourable, how useful, or how necessary\nsoever, produces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can\nafterwards be procured. The protection, security, and defence, of the\ncommonwealth, the effect of their labour this year, will not purchase its\nprotection, security, and defence, for the year to come. In the same class\nmust be ranked, some both of the gravest and most important, and some of\nthe most frivolous professions; churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of\nletters of all kinds; players, buffoons, musicians, opera-singers,\nopera-dancers, etc. The labour of the meanest of these has a certain\nvalue, regulated by the very same principles which regulate that of every\nother sort of labour; and that of the noblest and most useful, produces\nnothing which could afterwards purchase or procure an equal quantity of\nlabour. Like the declamation of the actor, the harangue of the orator, or\nthe tune of the musician, the work of all of them perishes in the very\ninstant of its production.\nBoth productive and unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at\nall, are all equally maintained by the annual produce of the land and\nlabour of the country. This produce, how great soever, can never be\ninfinite, but must have certain limits. According, therefore, as a smaller\nor greater proportion of it is in any one year employed in maintaining\nunproductive hands, the more in the one case, and the less in the other,\nwill remain for the productive, and the next year\u2019s produce will be\ngreater or smaller accordingly; the whole annual produce, if we except the\nspontaneous productions of the earth, being the effect of productive\nlabour.\nThough the whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country is\nno doubt ultimately destined for supplying the consumption of its\ninhabitants, and for procuring a revenue to them; yet when it first comes\neither from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, it\nnaturally divides itself into two parts. One of them, and frequently the\nlargest, is, in the first place, destined for replacing a capital, or for\nrenewing the provisions, materials, and finished work, which had been\nwithdrawn from a capital; the other for constituting a revenue either to\nthe owner of this capital, as the profit of his stock, or to some other\nperson, as the rent of his land. Thus, of the produce of land, one part\nreplaces the capital of the farmer; the other pays his profit and the rent\nof the landlord; and thus constitutes a revenue both to the owner of this\ncapital, as the profits of his stock, and to some other person as the rent\nof his land. Of the produce of a great manufactory, in the same manner,\none part, and that always the largest, replaces the capital of the\nundertaker of the work; the other pays his profit, and thus constitutes a\nrevenue to the owner of this capital.\nThat part of the annual produce of the land and labour of any country\nwhich replaces a capital, never is immediately employed to maintain any\nbut productive hands. It pays the wages of productive labour only. That\nwhich is immediately destined for constituting a revenue, either as profit\nor as rent, may maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive\nhands.\nWhatever part of his stock a man employs as a capital, he always expects\nit to be replaced to him with a profit. He employs it, therefore, in\nmaintaining productive hands only; and after having served in the function\nof a capital to him, it constitutes a revenue to them. Whenever he employs\nany part of it in maintaining unproductive hands of any kind, that part is\nfrom that moment withdrawn from his capital, and placed in his stock\nreserved for immediate consumption.\nUnproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at all, are all\nmaintained by revenue; either, first, by that part of the annual produce\nwhich is originally destined for constituting a revenue to some particular\npersons, either as the rent of land, or as the profits of stock; or,\nsecondly, by that part which, though originally destined for replacing a\ncapital, and for maintaining productive labourers only, yet when it comes\ninto their hands, whatever part of it is over and above their necessary\nsubsistence, may be employed in maintaining indifferently either\nproductive or unproductive hands. Thus, not only the great landlord or the\nrich merchant, but even the common workman, if his wages are considerable,\nmay maintain a menial servant; or he may sometimes go to a play or a\npuppet-show, and so contribute his share towards maintaining one set of\nunproductive labourers; or he may pay some taxes, and thus help to\nmaintain another set, more honourable and useful, indeed, but equally\nunproductive. No part of the annual produce, however, which had been\noriginally destined to replace a capital, is ever directed towards\nmaintaining unproductive hands, till after it has put into motion its full\ncomplement of productive labour, or all that it could put into motion in\nthe way in which it was employed. The workman must have earned his wages\nby work done, before he can employ any part of them in this manner. That\npart, too, is generally but a small one. It is his spare revenue only, of\nwhich productive labourers have seldom a great deal. They generally have\nsome, however; and in the payment of taxes, the greatness of their number\nmay compensate, in some measure, the smallness of their contribution. The\nrent of land and the profits of stock are everywhere, therefore, the\nprincipal sources from which unproductive hands derive their subsistence.\nThese are the two sorts of revenue of which the owners have generally most\nto spare. They might both maintain indifferently, either productive or\nunproductive hands. They seem, however, to have some predilection for the\nlatter. The expense of a great lord feeds generally more idle than\nindustrious people. The rich merchant, though with his capital he\nmaintains industrious people only, yet by his expense, that is, by the\nemployment of his revenue, he feeds commonly the very same sort as the\ngreat lord.\nThe proportion, therefore, between the productive and unproductive hands,\ndepends very much in every country upon the proportion between that part\nof the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from the ground,\nor from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined for replacing a\ncapital, and that which is destined for constituting a revenue, either as\nrent or as profit. This proportion is very different in rich from what it\nis in poor countries.\nThus, at present, in the opulent countries of Europe, a very large,\nfrequently the largest, portion of the produce of the land, is destined\nfor replacing the capital of the rich and independent farmer; the other\nfor paying his profits, and the rent of the landlord. But anciently,\nduring the prevalency of the feudal government, a very small portion of\nthe produce was sufficient to replace the capital employed in cultivation.\nIt consisted commonly in a few wretched cattle, maintained altogether by\nthe spontaneous produce of uncultivated land, and which might, therefore,\nbe considered as a part of that spontaneous produce. It generally, too,\nbelonged to the landlord, and was by him advanced to the occupiers of the\nland. All the rest of the produce properly belonged to him too, either as\nrent for his land, or as profit upon this paltry capital. The occupiers of\nland were generally bond-men, whose persons and effects were equally his\nproperty. Those who were not bond-men were tenants at will; and though the\nrent which they paid was often nominally little more than a quit-rent, it\nreally amounted to the whole produce of the land. Their lord could at all\ntimes command their labour in peace and their service in war. Though they\nlived at a distance from his house, they were equally dependent upon him\nas his retainers who lived in it. But the whole produce of the land\nundoubtedly belongs to him, who can dispose of the labour and service of\nall those whom it maintains. In the present state of Europe, the share of\nthe landlord seldom exceeds a third, sometimes not a fourth part of the\nwhole produce of the land. The rent of land, however, in all the improved\nparts of the country, has been tripled and quadrupled since those ancient\ntimes; and this third or fourth part of the annual produce is, it seems,\nthree or four times greater than the whole had been before. In the\nprogress of improvement, rent, though it increases in proportion to the\nextent, diminishes in proportion to the produce of the land.\nIn the opulent countries of Europe, great capitals are at present employed\nin trade and manufactures. In the ancient state, the little trade that was\nstirring, and the few homely and coarse manufactures that were carried on,\nrequired but very small capitals. These, however, must have yielded very\nlarge profits. The rate of interest was nowhere less than ten per cent.\nand their profits must have been sufficient to afford this great interest.\nAt present, the rate of interest, in the improved parts of Europe, is\nnowhere higher than six per cent.; and in some of the most improved, it is\nso low as four, three, and two per cent. Though that part of the revenue\nof the inhabitants which is derived from the profits of stock, is always\nmuch greater in rich than in poor countries, it is because the stock is\nmuch greater; in proportion to the stock, the profits are generally much\nless.\nThat part of the annual produce, therefore, which, as soon as it comes\neither from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is\ndestined for replacing a capital, is not only much greater in rich than in\npoor countries, but bears a much greater proportion to that which is\nimmediately destined for constituting a revenue either as rent or as\nprofit. The funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour are\nnot only much greater in the former than in the latter, but bear a much\ngreater proportion to those which, though they may be employed to maintain\neither productive or unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for\nthe latter.\nThe proportion between those different funds necessarily determines in\nevery country the general character of the inhabitants as to industry or\nidleness. We are more industrious than our forefathers, because, in the\npresent times, the funds destined for the maintenance of industry are much\ngreater in proportion to those which are likely to be employed in the\nmaintenance of idleness, than they were two or three centuries ago. Our\nancestors were idle for want of a sufficient encouragement to industry. It\nis better, says the proverb, to play for nothing, than to work for\nnothing. In mercantile and manufacturing towns, where the inferior ranks\nof people are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital, they are in\ngeneral industrious, sober, and thriving; as in many English, and in most\nDutch towns. In those towns which are principally supported by the\nconstant or occasional residence of a court, and in which the inferior\nranks of people are chiefly maintained by the spending of revenue, they\nare in general idle, dissolute, and poor; as at Rome, Versailles,\nCompeigne, and Fontainbleau. If you except Rouen and Bourdeaux, there is\nlittle trade or industry in any of the parliament towns of France; and the\ninferior ranks of people, being chiefly maintained by the expense of the\nmembers of the courts of justice, and of those who come to plead before\nthem, are in general idle and poor. The great trade of Rouen and Bourdeaux\nseems to be altogether the effect of their situation. Rouen is necessarily\nthe entrepot of almost all the goods which are brought either from foreign\ncountries, or from the maritime provinces of France, for the consumption\nof the great city of Paris. Bourdeaux is, in the same manner, the entrepot\nof the wines which grow upon the banks of the Garronne, and of the rivers\nwhich run into it, one of the richest wine countries in the world, and\nwhich seems to produce the wine fittest for exportation, or best suited to\nthe taste of foreign nations. Such advantageous situations necessarily\nattract a great capital by the great employment which they afford it; and\nthe employment of this capital is the cause of the industry of those two\ncities. In the other parliament towns of France, very little more capital\nseems to be employed than what is necessary for supplying their own\nconsumption; that is, little more than the smallest capital which can be\nemployed in them. The same thing may be said of Paris, Madrid, and Vienna.\nOf those three cities, Paris is by far the most industrious, but Paris\nitself is the principal market of all the manufactures established at\nParis, and its own consumption is the principal object of all the trade\nwhich it carries on. London, Lisbon, and Copenhagen, are, perhaps, the\nonly three cities in Europe, which are both the constant residence of a\ncourt, and can at the same time be considered as trading cities, or as\ncities which trade not only for their own consumption, but for that of\nother cities and countries. The situation of all the three is extremely\nadvantageous, and naturally fits them to be the entrepots of a great part\nof the goods destined for the consumption of distant places. In a city\nwhere a great revenue is spent, to employ with advantage a capital for any\nother purpose than for supplying the consumption of that city, is probably\nmore difficult than in one in which the inferior ranks of people have no\nother maintenance but what they derive from the employment of such a\ncapital. The idleness of the greater part of the people who are maintained\nby the expense of revenue, corrupts, it is probable, the industry of those\nwho ought to be maintained by the employment of capital, and renders it\nless advantageous to employ a capital there than in other places. There\nwas little trade or industry in Edinburgh before the Union. When the\nScotch parliament was no longer to be assembled in it, when it ceased to\nbe the necessary residence of the principal nobility and gentry of\nScotland, it became a city of some trade and industry. It still continues,\nhowever, to be the residence of the principal courts of justice in\nScotland, of the boards of customs and excise, etc. A considerable\nrevenue, therefore, still continues to be spent in it. In trade and\nindustry, it is much inferior to Glasgow, of which the inhabitants are\nchiefly maintained by the employment of capital. The inhabitants of a\nlarge village, it has sometimes been observed, after having made\nconsiderable progress in manufactures, have become idle and poor, in\nconsequence of a great lord\u2019s having taken up his residence in their\nneighbourhood.\nThe proportion between capital and revenue, therefore, seems everywhere to\nregulate the proportion between industry and idleness. Wherever capital\npredominates, industry prevails; wherever revenue, idleness. Every\nincrease or diminution of capital, therefore, naturally tends to increase\nor diminish the real quantity of industry, the number of productive hands,\nand consequently the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land\nand labour of the country, the real wealth and revenue of all its\ninhabitants.\nCapitals are increased by parsimony, and diminished by prodigality and\nmisconduct.\nWhatever a person saves from his revenue he adds to his capital, and\neither employs it himself in maintaining an additional number of\nproductive hands, or enables some other person to do so, by lending it to\nhim for an interest, that is, for a share of the profits. As the capital\nof an individual can be increased only by what he saves from his annual\nrevenue or his annual gains, so the capital of a society, which is the\nsame with that of all the individuals who compose it, can be increased\nonly in the same manner.\nParsimony, and not industry, is the immediate cause of the increase of\ncapital. Industry, indeed, provides the subject which parsimony\naccumulates; but whatever industry might acquire, if parsimony did not\nsave and store up, the capital would never be the greater.\nParsimony, by increasing the fund which is destined for the maintenance of\nproductive hands, tends to increase the number of those hands whose labour\nadds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed. It tends,\ntherefore, to increase the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the\nland and labour of the country. It puts into motion an additional quantity\nof industry, which gives an additional value to the annual produce.\nWhat is annually saved, is as regularly consumed as what is annually\nspent, and nearly in the same time too: but it is consumed by a different\nset of people. That portion of his revenue which a rich man annually\nspends, is, in most cases, consumed by idle guests and menial servants,\nwho leave nothing behind them in return for their consumption. That\nportion which he annually saves, as, for the sake of the profit, it is\nimmediately employed as a capital, is consumed in the same manner, and\nnearly in the same time too, but by a different set of people: by\nlabourers, manufacturers, and artificers, who reproduce, with a profit,\nthe value of their annual consumption. His revenue, we shall suppose, is\npaid him in money. Had he spent the whole, the food, clothing, and\nlodging, which the whole could have purchased, would have been distributed\namong the former set of people. By saving a part of it, as that part is,\nfor the sake of the profit, immediately employed as a capital, either by\nhimself or by some other person, the food, clothing, and lodging, which\nmay be purchased with it, are necessarily reserved for the latter. The\nconsumption is the same, but the consumers are different.\nBy what a frugal man annually saves, he not only affords maintenance to an\nadditional number of productive hands, for that of the ensuing year, but\nlike the founder of a public work-house he establishes, as it were, a\nperpetual fund for the maintenance of an equal number in all times to\ncome. The perpetual allotment and destination of this fund, indeed, is not\nalways guarded by any positive law, by any trust-right or deed of\nmortmain. It is always guarded, however, by a very powerful principle, the\nplain and evident interest of every individual to whom any share of it\nshall ever belong. No part of it can ever afterwards be employed to\nmaintain any but productive hands, without an evident loss to the person\nwho thus perverts it from its proper destination.\nThe prodigal perverts it in this manner: By not confining his expense\nwithin his income, he encroaches upon his capital. Like him who perverts\nthe revenues of some pious foundation to profane purposes, he pays the\nwages of idleness with those funds which the frugality of his forefathers\nhad, as it were, consecrated to the maintenance of industry. By\ndiminishing the funds destined for the employment of productive labour, he\nnecessarily diminishes, so far as it depends upon him, the quantity of\nthat labour which adds a value to the subject upon which it is bestowed,\nand, consequently, the value of the annual produce of the land and labour\nof the whole country, the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. If\nthe prodigality of some were not compensated by the frugality of others,\nthe conduct of every prodigal, by feeding the idle with the bread of the\nindustrious, would tend not only to beggar himself, but to impoverish his\ncountry.\nThough the expense of the prodigal should be altogether in home made, and\nno part of it in foreign commodities, its effect upon the productive funds\nof the society would still be the same. Every year there would still be a\ncertain quantity of food and clothing, which ought to have maintained\nproductive, employed in maintaining unproductive hands. Every year,\ntherefore, there would still be some diminution in what would otherwise\nhave been the value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the\ncountry.\nThis expense, it may be said, indeed, not being in foreign goods, and not\noccasioning any exportation of gold and silver, the same quantity of money\nwould remain in the country as before. But if the quantity of food and\nclothing which were thus consumed by unproductive, had been distributed\namong productive hands, they would have reproduced, together with a\nprofit, the full value of their consumption. The same quantity of money\nwould, in this case, equally have remained in the country, and there\nwould, besides, have been a reproduction of an equal value of consumable\ngoods. There would have been two values instead of one.\nThe same quantity of money, besides, can not long remain in any country in\nwhich the value of the annual produce diminishes. The sole use of money is\nto circulate consumable goods. By means of it, provisions, materials, and\nfinished work, are bought and sold, and distributed to their proper\nconsumers. The quantity of money, therefore, which can be annually\nemployed in any country, must be determined by the value of the consumable\ngoods annually circulated within it. These must consist, either in the\nimmediate produce of the land and labour of the country itself, or in\nsomething which had been purchased with some part of that produce. Their\nvalue, therefore, must diminish as the value of that produce diminishes,\nand along with it the quantity of money which can be employed in\ncirculating them. But the money which, by this annual diminution of\nproduce, is annually thrown out of domestic circulation, will not be\nallowed to lie idle. The interest of whoever possesses it requires that it\nshould be employed; but having no employment at home, it will, in spite of\nall laws and prohibitions, be sent abroad, and employed in purchasing\nconsumable goods, which may be of some use at home. Its annual exportation\nwill, in this manner, continue for some time to add something to the\nannual consumption of the country beyond the value of its own annual\nproduce. What in the days of its prosperity had been saved from that\nannual produce, and employed in purchasing gold and silver, will\ncontribute, for some little time, to support its consumption in adversity.\nThe exportation of gold and silver is, in this case, not the cause, but\nthe effect of its declension, and may even, for some little time,\nalleviate the misery of that declension.\nThe quantity of money, on the contrary, must in every country naturally\nincrease as the value of the annual produce increases. The value of the\nconsumable goods annually circulated within the society being greater,\nwill require a greater quantity of money to circulate them. A part of the\nincreased produce, therefore, will naturally be employed in purchasing,\nwherever it is to be had, the additional quantity of gold and silver\nnecessary for circulating the rest. The increase of those metals will, in\nthis case, be the effect, not the cause, of the public prosperity. Gold\nand silver are purchased everywhere in the same manner. The food,\nclothing, and lodging, the revenue and maintenance, of all those whose\nlabour or stock is employed in bringing them from the mine to the market,\nis the price paid for them in Peru as well as in England. The country\nwhich has this price to pay, will never belong without the quantity of\nthose metals which it has occasion for; and no country will ever long\nretain a quantity which it has no occasion for.\nWhatever, therefore, we may imagine the real wealth and revenue of a\ncountry to consist in, whether in the value of the annual produce of its\nland and labour, as plain reason seems to dictate, or in the quantity of\nthe precious metals which circulate within it, as vulgar prejudices\nsuppose; in either view of the matter, every prodigal appears to be a\npublic enemy, and every frugal man a public benefactor.\nThe effects of misconduct are often the same as those of prodigality.\nEvery injudicious and unsuccessful project in agriculture, mines,\nfisheries, trade, or manufactures, tends in the same manner to diminish\nthe funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour. In every such\nproject, though the capital is consumed by productive hands only, yet as,\nby the injudicious manner in which they are employed, they do not\nreproduce the full value of their consumption, there must always be some\ndiminution in what would otherwise have been the productive funds of the\nsociety.\nIt can seldom happen, indeed, that the circumstances of a great nation can\nbe much affected either by the prodigality or misconduct of individuals;\nthe profusion or imprudence of some being always more than compensated by\nthe frugality and good conduct of others.\nWith regard to profusion, the principle which prompts to expense is the\npassion for present enjoyment; which, though sometimes violent and very\ndifficult to be restrained, is in general only momentary and occasional.\nBut the principle which prompts to save, is the desire of bettering our\ncondition; a desire which, though generally calm and dispassionate, comes\nwith us from the womb, and never leaves us till we go into the grave. In\nthe whole interval which separates those two moments, there is scarce,\nperhaps, a single instance, in which any man is so perfectly and\ncompletely satisfied with his situation, as to be without any wish of\nalteration or improvement of any kind. An augmentation of fortune is the\nmeans by which the greater part of men propose and wish to better their\ncondition. It is the means the most vulgar and the most obvious; and the\nmost likely way of augmenting their fortune, is to save and accumulate\nsome part of what they acquire, either regularly and annually, or upon\nsome extraordinary occasion. Though the principle of expense, therefore,\nprevails in almost all men upon some occasions, and in some men upon\nalmost all occasions; yet in the greater part of men, taking the whole\ncourse of their life at an average, the principle of frugality seems not\nonly to predominate, but to predominate very greatly.\nWith regard to misconduct, the number of prudent and successful\nundertakings is everywhere much greater than that of injudicious and\nunsuccessful ones. After all our complaints of the frequency of\nbankruptcies, the unhappy men who fall into this misfortune, make but a\nvery small part of the whole number engaged in trade, and all other sorts\nof business; not much more, perhaps, than one in a thousand. Bankruptcy\nis, perhaps, the greatest and most humiliating calamity which can befal an\ninnocent man. The greater part of men, therefore, are sufficiently careful\nto avoid it. Some, indeed, do not avoid it; as some do not avoid the\ngallows.\nGreat nations are never impoverished by private, though they sometimes are\nby public prodigality and misconduct. The whole, or almost the whole\npublic revenue is, in most countries, employed in maintaining unproductive\nhands. Such are the people who compose a numerous and splendid court, a\ngreat ecclesiastical establishment, great fleets and armies, who in time\nof peace produce nothing, and in time of war acquire nothing which can\ncompensate the expense of maintaining them, even while the war lasts. Such\npeople, as they themselves produce nothing, are all maintained by the\nproduce of other men\u2019s labour. When multiplied, therefore, to an\nunnecessary number, they may in a particular year consume so great a share\nof this produce, as not to leave a sufficiency for maintaining the\nproductive labourers, who should reproduce it next year. The next year\u2019s\nproduce, therefore, will be less than that of the foregoing; and if the\nsame disorder should continue, that of the third year will be still less\nthan that of the second. Those unproductive hands who should be maintained\nby a part only of the spare revenue of the people, may consume so great a\nshare of their whole revenue, and thereby oblige so great a number to\nencroach upon their capitals, upon the funds destined for the maintenance\nof productive labour, that all the frugality and good conduct of\nindividuals may not be able to compensate the waste and degradation of\nproduce occasioned by this violent and forced encroachment.\nThis frugality and good conduct, however, is, upon most occasions, it\nappears from experience, sufficient to compensate, not only the private\nprodigality and misconduct of individuals, but the public extravagance of\ngovernment. The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man\nto better his condition, the principle from which public and national, as\nwell as private opulence is originally derived, is frequently powerful\nenough to maintain the natural progress of things towards improvement, in\nspite both of the extravagance of government, and of the greatest errors\nof administration. Like the unknown principle of animal life, it\nfrequently restores health and vigour to the constitution, in spite not\nonly of the disease, but of the absurd prescriptions of the doctor.\nThe annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased\nin its value by no other means, but by increasing either the number of its\nproductive labourers, or the productive powers of those labourers who had\nbefore been employed. The number of its productive labourers, it is\nevident, can never be much increased, but in consequence of an increase of\ncapital, or of the funds destined for maintaining them. The productive\npowers of the same number of labourers cannot be increased, but in\nconsequence either of some addition and improvement to those machines and\ninstruments which facilitate and abridge labour, or of more proper\ndivision and distribution of employment. In either case, an additional\ncapital is almost always required. It is by means of an additional capital\nonly, that the undertaker of any work can either provide his workmen with\nbetter machinery, or make a more proper distribution of employment among\nthem. When the work to be done consists of a number of parts, to keep\nevery man constantly employed in one way, requires a much greater capital\nthan where every man is occasionally employed in every different part of\nthe work. When we compare, therefore, the state of a nation at two\ndifferent periods, and find that the annual produce of its land and labour\nis evidently greater at the latter than at the former, that its lands are\nbetter cultivated, its manufactures more numerous and more flourishing,\nand its trade more extensive; we may be assured that its capital must have\nincreased during the interval between those two periods, and that more\nmust have been added to it by the good conduct of some, than had been\ntaken from it either by the private misconduct of others, or by the public\nextravagance of government. But we shall find this to have been the case\nof almost all nations, in all tolerably quiet and peaceable times, even of\nthose who have not enjoyed the most prudent and parsimonious governments.\nTo form a right judgment of it, indeed, we must compare the state of the\ncountry at periods somewhat distant from one another. The progress is\nfrequently so gradual, that, at near periods, the improvement is not only\nnot sensible, but, from the declension either of certain branches of\nindustry, or of certain districts of the country, things which sometimes\nhappen, though the country in general is in great prosperity, there\nfrequently arises a suspicion, that the riches and industry of the whole\nare decaying.\nThe annual produce of the land and labour of England, for example, is\ncertainly much greater than it was a little more than a century ago, at\nthe restoration of Charles II. Though at present few people, I believe,\ndoubt of this, yet during this period five years have seldom passed away,\nin which some book or pamphlet has not been published, written, too, with\nsuch abilities as to gain some authority with the public, and pretending\nto demonstrate that the wealth of the nation was fast declining; that the\ncountry was depopulated, agriculture neglected, manufactures decaying, and\ntrade undone. Nor have these publications been all party pamphlets, the\nwretched offspring of falsehood and venality. Many of them have been\nwritten by very candid and very intelligent people, who wrote nothing but\nwhat they believed, and for no other reason but because they believed it.\nThe annual produce of the land and labour of England, again, was certainly\nmuch greater at the Restoration than we can suppose it to have been about\na hundred years before, at the accession of Elizabeth. At this period,\ntoo, we have all reason to believe, the country was much more advanced in\nimprovement, than it had been about a century before, towards the close of\nthe dissensions between the houses of York and Lancaster. Even then it\nwas, probably, in a better condition than it had been at the Norman\nconquest: and at the Norman conquest, than during the confusion of the\nSaxon heptarchy. Even at this early period, it was certainly a more\nimproved country than at the invasion of Julius Caesar, when its\ninhabitants were nearly in the same state with the savages in North\nAmerica.\nIn each of those periods, however, there was not only much private and\npublic profusion, many expensive and unnecessary wars, great perversion of\nthe annual produce from maintaining productive to maintain unproductive\nhands; but sometimes, in the confusion of civil discord, such absolute\nwaste and destruction of stock, as might be supposed, not only to retard,\nas it certainly did, the natural accumulation of riches, but to have left\nthe country, at the end of the period, poorer than at the beginning. Thus,\nin the happiest and most fortunate period of them all, that which has\npassed since the Restoration, how many disorders and misfortunes have\noccurred, which, could they have been foreseen, not only the\nimpoverishment, but the total ruin of the country would have been expected\nfrom them? The fire and the plague of London, the two Dutch wars, the\ndisorders of the revolution, the war in Ireland, the four expensive French\nwars of 1688, 1701, 1742, and 1756, together with the two rebellions of\n1715 and 1745. In the course of the four French wars, the nation has\ncontracted more than \u00a3145,000,000 of debt, over and above all the other\nextraordinary annual expense which they occasioned; so that the whole\ncannot be computed at less than \u00a3200,000,000. So great a share of the\nannual produce of the land and labour of the country, has, since the\nRevolution, been employed upon different occasions, in maintaining an\nextraordinary number of unproductive hands. But had not those wars given\nthis particular direction to so large a capital, the greater part of it\nwould naturally have been employed in maintaining productive hands, whose\nlabour would have replaced, with a profit, the whole value of their\nconsumption. The value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the\ncountry would have been considerably increased by it every year, and every\nyears increase would have augmented still more that of the following year.\nMore houses would have been built, more lands would have been improved,\nand those which had been improved before would have been better\ncultivated; more manufactures would have been established, and those which\nhad been established before would have been more extended; and to what\nheight the real wealth and revenue of the country might by this time have\nbeen raised, it is not perhaps very easy even to imagine.\nBut though the profusion of government must undoubtedly have retarded the\nnatural progress of England towards wealth and improvement, it has not\nbeen able to stop it. The annual produce of its land and labour is\nundoubtedly much greater at present than it was either at the Restoration\nor at the Revolution. The capital, therefore, annually employed in\ncultivating this land, and in maintaining this labour, must likewise be\nmuch greater. In the midst of all the exactions of government, this\ncapital has been silently and gradually accumulated by the private\nfrugality and good conduct of individuals, by their universal, continual,\nand uninterrupted effort to better their own condition. It is this effort,\nprotected by law, and allowed by liberty to exert itself in the manner\nthat is most advantageous, which has maintained the progress of England\ntowards opulence and improvement in almost all former times, and which, it\nis to be hoped, will do so in all future times. England, however, as it\nhas never been blessed with a very parsimonious government, so parsimony\nhas at no time been the characteristic virtue of its inhabitants. It is\nthe highest impertinence and presumption, therefore, in kings and\nministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private people, and to\nrestrain their expense, either by sumptuary laws, or by prohibiting the\nimportation of foreign luxuries. They are themselves always, and without\nany exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society. Let them look\nwell after their own expense, and they may safely trust private people\nwith theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the state, that of\nthe subject never will.\nAs frugality increases, and prodigality diminishes, the public capital, so\nthe conduct of those whose expense just equals their revenue, without\neither accumulating or encroaching, neither increases nor diminishes it.\nSome modes of expense, however, seem to contribute more to the growth of\npublic opulence than others.\nThe revenue of an individual may be spent, either in things which are\nconsumed immediately, and in which one day\u2019s expense can neither alleviate\nnor support that of another; or it may be spent in things mere durable,\nwhich can therefore be accumulated, and in which every day\u2019s expense may,\nas he chooses, either alleviate, or support and heighten, the effect of\nthat of the following day. A man of fortune, for example, may either spend\nhis revenue in a profuse and sumptuous table, and in maintaining a great\nnumber of menial servants, and a multitude of dogs and horses; or,\ncontenting himself with a frugal table, and few attendants, he may lay out\nthe greater part of it in adorning his house or his country villa, in\nuseful or ornamental buildings, in useful or ornamental furniture, in\ncollecting books, statues, pictures; or in things more frivolous, jewels,\nbaubles, ingenious trinkets of different kinds; or, what is most trifling\nof all, in amassing a great wardrobe of fine clothes, like the favourite\nand minister of a great prince who died a few years ago. Were two men of\nequal fortune to spend their revenue, the one chiefly in the one way, the\nother in the other, the magnificence of the person whose expense had been\nchiefly in durable commodities, would be continually increasing, every\nday\u2019s expense contributing something to support and heighten the effect of\nthat of the following day; that of the other, on the contrary, would be no\ngreater at the end of the period than at the beginning. The former too\nwould, at the end of the period, be the richer man of the two. He would\nhave a stock of goods of some kind or other, which, though it might not be\nworth all that it cost, would always be worth something. No trace or\nvestige of the expense of the latter would remain, and the effects of ten\nor twenty years\u2019 profusion would be as completely annihilated as if they\nhad never existed.\nAs the one mode of expense is more favourable than the other to the\nopulence of an individual, so is it likewise to that of a nation. The\nhouses, the furniture, the clothing of the rich, in a little time, become\nuseful to the inferior and middling ranks of people. They are able to\npurchase them when their superiors grow weary of them; and the general\naccommodation of the whole people is thus gradually improved, when this\nmode of expense becomes universal among men of fortune. In countries which\nhave long been rich, you will frequently find the inferior ranks of people\nin possession both of houses and furniture perfectly good and entire, but\nof which neither the one could have been built, nor the other have been\nmade for their use. What was formerly a seat of the family of Seymour, is\nnow an inn upon the Bath road. The marriage-bed of James I. of Great\nBritain, which his queen brought with her from Denmark, as a present fit\nfor a sovereign to make to a sovereign, was, a few years ago, the ornament\nof an alehouse at Dunfermline. In some ancient cities, which either have\nbeen long stationary, or have gone somewhat to decay, you will sometimes\nscarce find a single house which could have been built for its present\ninhabitants. If you go into those houses, too, you will frequently find\nmany excellent, though antiquated pieces of furniture, which are still\nvery fit for use, and which could as little have been made for them. Noble\npalaces, magnificent villas, great collections of books, statues,\npictures, and other curiosities, are frequently both an ornament and an\nhonour, not only to the neighbourhood, but to the whole country to which\nthey belong. Versailles is an ornament and an honour to France, Stowe and\nWilton to England. Italy still continues to command some sort of\nveneration, by the number of monuments of this kind which it possesses,\nthough the wealth which produced them has decayed, and though the genius\nwhich planned them seems to be extinguished, perhaps from not having the\nsame employment.\nThe expense, too, which is laid out in durable commodities, is favourable\nnot only to accumulation, but to frugality. If a person should at any time\nexceed in it, he can easily reform without exposing himself to the censure\nof the public. To reduce very much the number of his servants, to reform\nhis table from great profusion to great frugality, to lay down his\nequipage after he has once set it up, are changes which cannot escape the\nobservation of his neighbours, and which are supposed to imply some\nacknowledgment of preceding bad conduct. Few, therefore, of those who have\nonce been so unfortunate as to launch out too far into this sort of\nexpense, have afterwards the courage to reform, till ruin and bankruptcy\noblige them. But if a person has, at any time, been at too great an\nexpense in building, in furniture, in books, or pictures, no imprudence\ncan be inferred from his changing his conduct. These are things in which\nfurther expense is frequently rendered unnecessary by former expense; and\nwhen a person stops short, he appears to do so, not because he has\nexceeded his fortune, but because he has satisfied his fancy.\nThe expense, besides, that is laid out in durable commodities, gives\nmaintenance, commonly, to a greater number of people than that which is\nemployed in the most profuse hospitality. Of two or three hundred weight\nof provisions, which may sometimes be served up at a great festival, one\nhalf, perhaps, is thrown to the dunghill, and there is always a great deal\nwasted and abused. But if the expense of this entertainment had been\nemployed in setting to work masons, carpenters, upholsterers, mechanics,\netc. a quantity of provisions of equal value would have been distributed\namong a still greater number of people, who would have bought them in\npennyworths and pound weights, and not have lost or thrown away a single\nounce of them. In the one way, besides, this expense maintains productive,\nin the other unproductive hands. In the one way, therefore, it increases,\nin the other it does not increase the exchangeable value of the annual\nproduce of the land and labour of the country.\nI would not, however, by all this, be understood to mean, that the one\nspecies of expense always betokens a more liberal or generous spirit than\nthe other. When a man of fortune spends his revenue chiefly in\nhospitality, he shares the greater part of it with his friends and\ncompanions; but when he employs it in purchasing such durable commodities,\nhe often spends the whole upon his own person, and gives nothing to any\nbody without an equivalent. The latter species of expense, therefore,\nespecially when directed towards frivolous objects, the little ornaments\nof dress and furniture, jewels, trinkets, gew-gaws, frequently indicates,\nnot only a trifling, but a base and selfish disposition. All that I mean\nis, that the one sort of expense, as it always occasions some accumulation\nof valuable commodities, as it is more favourable to private frugality,\nand, consequently, to the increase of the public capital, and as it\nmaintains productive rather than unproductive hands, conduces more than\nthe other to the growth of public opulence.\nCHAPTER IV.\nOF STOCK LENT AT INTEREST.\nThe stock which is lent at interest is always considered as a capital by\nthe lender. He expects that in due time it is to be restored to him, and\nthat, in the mean time, the borrower is to pay him a certain annual rent\nfor the use of it. The borrower may use it either as a capital, or as a\nstock reserved for immediate consumption. If he uses it as a capital, he\nemploys it in the maintenance of productive labourers, who reproduce the\nvalue, with a profit. He can, in this case, both restore the capital, and\npay the interest, without alienating or encroaching upon any other source\nof revenue. If he uses it as a stock reserved for immediate consumption,\nhe acts the part of a prodigal, and dissipates, in the maintenance of the\nidle, what was destined for the support of the industrious. He can, in\nthis case, neither restore the capital nor pay the interest, without\neither alienating or encroaching upon some other source of revenue, such\nas the property or the rent of land.\nThe stock which is lent at interest is, no doubt, occasionally employed in\nboth these ways, but in the former much more frequently than in the\nlatter. The man who borrows in order to spend will soon be ruined, and he\nwho lends to him will generally have occasion to repent of his folly. To\nborrow or to lend for such a purpose, therefore, is, in all cases, where\ngross usury is out of the question, contrary to the interest of both\nparties; and though it no doubt happens sometimes, that people do both the\none and the other, yet, from the regard that all men have for their own\ninterest, we may be assured, that it cannot happen so very frequently as\nwe are sometimes apt to imagine. Ask any rich man of common prudence, to\nwhich of the two sorts of people he has lent the greater part of his\nstock, to those who he thinks will employ it profitably, or to those who\nwill spend it idly, and he will laugh at you for proposing the question.\nEven among borrowers, therefore, not the people in the world most famous\nfor frugality, the number of the frugal and industrious surpasses\nconsiderably that of the prodigal and idle.\nThe only people to whom stock is commonly lent, without their being\nexpected to make any very profitable use of it, are country gentlemen, who\nborrow upon mortgage. Even they scarce ever borrow merely to spend. What\nthey borrow, one may say, is commonly spent before they borrow it. They\nhave generally consumed so great a quantity of goods, advanced to them\nupon credit by shop-keepers and tradesmen, that they find it necessary to\nborrow at interest, in order to pay the debt. The capital borrowed\nreplaces the capitals of those shop-keepers and tradesmen which the\ncountry gentlemen could not have replaced from the rents of their estates.\nIt is not properly borrowed in order to be spent, but in order to replace\na capital which had been spent before.\nAlmost all loans at interest are made in money, either of paper, or of\ngold and silver; but what the borrower really wants, and what the lender\nreadily supplies him with, is not the money, but the money\u2019s worth, or the\ngoods which it can purchase. If he wants it as a stock for immediate\nconsumption, it is those goods only which he can place in that stock. If\nhe wants it as a capital for employing industry, it is from those goods\nonly that the industrious can be furnished with the tools, materials, and\nmaintenance necessary for carrying on their work. By means of the loan,\nthe lender, as it were, assigns to the borrower his right to a certain\nportion of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, to be\nemployed as the borrower pleases.\nThe quantity of stock, therefore, or, as it is commonly expressed, of\nmoney, which can be lent at interest in any country, is not regulated by\nthe value of the money, whether paper or coin, which serves as the\ninstrument of the different loans made in that country, but by the value\nof that part of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from\nthe ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined,\nnot only for replacing a capital, but such a capital as the owner does not\ncare to be at the trouble of employing himself. As such capitals are\ncommonly lent out and paid back in money, they constitute what is called\nthe monied interest. It is distinct, not only from the landed, but from\nthe trading and manufacturing interests, as in these last the owners\nthemselves employ their own capitals. Even in the monied interest,\nhowever, the money is, as it were, but the deed of assignment, which\nconveys from one hand to another those capitals which the owners do not\ncare to employ themselves. Those capitals may be greater, in almost any\nproportion, than the amount of the money which serves as the instrument of\ntheir conveyance; the same pieces of money successively serving for many\ndifferent loans, as well as for many different purchases. A, for example,\nlends to W \u00a31000, with which W immediately purchases of B \u00a31000 worth of\ngoods. B having no occasion for the money himself, lends the identical\npieces to X, with which X immediately purchases of C another \u00a31000 worth\nof goods. C, in the same manner, and for the same reason, lends them to Y,\nwho again purchases goods with them of D. In this manner, the same pieces,\neither of coin or of paper, may, in the course of a few days, serve as the\nInstrument of three different loans, and of three different purchases,\neach of which is, in value, equal to the whole amount of those pieces.\nWhat the three monied men, A, B, and C, assigned to the three borrowers,\nW, X, and Y, is the power of making those purchases. In this power consist\nboth the value and the use of the loans. The stock lent by the three\nmonied men is equal to the value of the goods which can be purchased with\nit, and is three times greater than that of the money with which the\npurchases are made. Those loans, however, may be all perfectly well\nsecured, the goods purchased by the different debtors being so employed\nas, in due time, to bring back, with a profit, an equal value either of\ncoin or of paper. And as the same pieces of money can thus serve as the\ninstrument of different loans to three, or, for the same reason, to thirty\ntimes their value, so they may likewise successively serve as the\ninstrument of repayment.\nA capital lent at interest may, in this manner, be considered as an\nassignment, from the lender to the borrower, of a certain considerable\nportion of the annual produce, upon condition that the burrower in return\nshall, during the continuance of the loan, annually assign to the lender a\nsmall portion, called the interest; and, at the end of it, a portion\nequally considerable with that which had originally been assigned to him,\ncalled the repayment. Though money, either coin or paper, serves generally\nas the deed of assignment, both to the smaller and to the more\nconsiderable portion, it is itself altogether different from what is\nassigned by it.\nIn proportion as that share of the annual produce which, as soon as it\ncomes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive\nlabourers, is destined for replacing a capital, increases in any country,\nwhat is called the monied interest naturally increases with it. The\nincrease of those particular capitals from which the owners wish to derive\na revenue, without being at the trouble of employing them themselves,\nnaturally accompanies the general increase of capitals; or, in other\nwords, as stock increases, the quantity of stock to be lent at interest\ngrows gradually greater and greater.\nAs the quantity of stock to be lent at interest increases, the interest,\nor the price which must be paid for the use of that stock, necessarily\ndiminishes, not only from those general causes which make the market price\nof things commonly diminish as their quantity increases, but from other\ncauses which are peculiar to this particular case. As capitals increase in\nany country, the profits which can be made by employing them necessarily\ndiminish. It becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the\ncountry a profitable method of employing any new capital. There arises, in\nconsequence, a competition between different capitals, the owner of one\nendeavouring to get possession of that employment which is occupied by\nanother; but, upon most occasions, he can hope to justle that other out of\nthis employment by no other means but by dealing upon more reasonable\nterms. He must not only sell what he deals in somewhat cheaper, but, in\norder to get it to sell, he must sometimes, too, buy it dearer. The demand\nfor productive labour, by the increase of the funds which are destined for\nmaintaining it, grows every day greater and greater. Labourers easily find\nemployment; but the owners of capitals find it difficult to get labourers\nto employ. Their competition raises the wages of labour, and sinks the\nprofits of stock. But when the profits which can be made by the use of a\ncapital are in this manner diminished, as it were, at both ends, the price\nwhich can be paid for the use of it, that is, the rate of interest, must\nnecessarily be diminished with them.\nMr Locke, Mr Lawe, and Mr Montesquieu, as well as many other writers, seem\nto have imagined that the increase of the quantity of gold and silver, in\nconsequence of the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, was the real\ncause of the lowering of the rate of interest through the greater part of\nEurope. Those metals, they say, having become of less value themselves,\nthe use of any particular portion of them necessarily became of less value\ntoo, and, consequently, the price which could be paid for it. This notion,\nwhich at first sight seems so plausible, has been so fully exposed by Mr\nHume, that it is, perhaps, unnecessary to say any thing more about it. The\nfollowing very short and plain argument, however, may serve to explain\nmore distinctly the fallacy which seems to have misled those gentlemen.\nBefore the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, ten per cent. seems to\nhave been the common rate of interest through the greater part of Europe.\nIt has since that time, in different countries, sunk to six, five, four,\nand three per cent. Let us suppose, that in every particular country the\nvalue of silver has sunk precisely in the same proportion as the rate of\ninterest; and that in those countries, for example, where interest has\nbeen reduced from ten to five per cent. the same quantity of silver can\nnow purchase just half the quantity of goods which it could have purchased\nbefore. This supposition will not, I believe, be found anywhere agreeable\nto the truth; but it is the most favourable to the opinion which we are\ngoing to examine; and, even upon this supposition, it is utterly\nimpossible that the lowering of the value of silver could have the\nsmallest tendency to lower the rate of interest. If \u00a3100 are in those\ncountries now of no more value than \u00a350 were then, \u00a310 must now be of no\nmore value than \u00a35 were then. Whatever were the causes which lowered the\nvalue of the capital, the same must necessarily have lowered that of the\ninterest, and exactly in the same proportion. The proportion between the\nvalue of the capital and that of the interest must have remained the same,\nthough the rate had never been altered. By altering the rate, on the\ncontrary, the proportion between those two values is necessarily altered.\nIf \u00a3100 now are worth no more than \u00a350 were then, \u00a35 now can be worth no\nmore than \u00a32:10s. were then. By reducing the rate of interest, therefore,\nfrom ten to five per cent. we give for the use of a capital, which is\nsupposed to be equal to one half of its former value, an interest which is\nequal to one fourth only of the value of the former interest.\nAn increase in the quantity of silver, while that of the commodities\ncirculated by means of it remained the same, could have no other effect\nthan to diminish the value of that metal. The nominal value of all sorts\nof goods would be greater, but their real value would be precisely the\nsame as before. They would be exchanged for a greater number of pieces of\nsilver; but the quantity of labour which they could command, the number of\npeople whom they could maintain and employ, would be precisely the same.\nThe capital of the country would be the same, though a greater number of\npieces might be requisite for conveying any equal portion of it from one\nhand to another. The deeds of assignment, like the conveyances of a\nverbose attorney, would be more cumbersome; but the thing assigned would\nbe precisely the same as before, and could produce only the same effects.\nThe funds for maintaining productive labour being the same, the demand for\nit would be the same. Its price or wages, therefore, though nominally\ngreater, would really be the same. They would be paid in a greater number\nof pieces of silver, but they would purchase only the same quantity of\ngoods. The profits of stock would be the same, both nominally and really.\nThe wages of labour are commonly computed by the quantity of silver which\nis paid to the labourer. When that is increased, therefore, his wages\nappear to be increased, though they may sometimes be no greater than\nbefore. But the profits of stock are not computed by the number of pieces\nof silver with which they are paid, but by the proportion which those\npieces bear to the whole capital employed. Thus, in a particular country,\n5s. a-week are said to be the common wages of labour, and ten per cent.\nthe common profits of stock; but the whole capital of the country being\nthe same as before, the competition between the different capitals of\nindividuals into which it was divided would likewise be the same. They\nwould all trade with the same advantages and disadvantages. The common\nproportion between capital and profit, therefore, would be the same, and\nconsequently the common interest of money; what can commonly be given for\nthe use of money being necessarily regulated by what can commonly be made\nby the use of it.\nAny increase in the quantity of commodities annually circulated within the\ncountry, while that of the money which circulated them remained the same,\nwould, on the contrary, produce many other important effects, besides that\nof raising the value of the money. The capital of the country, though it\nmight nominally be the same, would really be augmented. It might continue\nto be expressed by the same quantity of money, but it would command a\ngreater quantity of labour. The quantity of productive labour which it\ncould maintain and employ would be increased, and consequently the demand\nfor that labour. Its wages would naturally rise with the demand, and yet\nmight appear to sink. They might be paid with a smaller quantity of money,\nbut that smaller quantity might purchase a greater quantity of goods than\na greater had done before. The profits of stock would be diminished, both\nreally and in appearance. The whole capital of the country being\naugmented, the competition between the different capitals of which it was\ncomposed would naturally be augmented along with it. The owners of those\nparticular capitals would be obliged to content themselves with a smaller\nproportion of the produce of that labour which their respective capitals\nemployed. The interest of money, keeping pace always with the profits of\nstock, might, in this manner, be greatly diminished, though the value of\nmoney, or the quantity of goods which any particular sum could purchase,\nwas greatly augmented.\nIn some countries the interest of money has been prohibited by law. But as\nsomething can everywhere be made by the use of money, something ought\neverywhere to be paid for the use of it. This regulation, instead of\npreventing, has been found from experience to increase the evil of usury.\nThe debtor being obliged to pay, not only for the use of the money, but\nfor the risk which his creditor runs by accepting a compensation for that\nuse, he is obliged, if one may say so, to insure his creditor from the\npenalties of usury.\nIn countries where interest is permitted, the law in order to prevent the\nextortion of usury, generally fixes the highest rate which can be taken\nwithout incurring a penalty. This rate ought always to be somewhat above\nthe lowest market price, or the price which is commonly paid for the use\nof money by those who can give the most undoubted security. If this legal\nrate should be fixed below the lowest market rate, the effects of this\nfixation must be nearly the same as those of a total prohibition of\ninterest. The creditor will not lend his money for less than the use of it\nis worth, and the debtor must pay him for the risk which he runs by\naccepting the full value of that use. If it is fixed precisely at the\nlowest market price, it ruins, with honest people who respect the laws of\ntheir country, the credit of all those who cannot give the very best\nsecurity, and obliges them to have recourse to exorbitant usurers. In a\ncountry such as Great Britain, where money is lent to government at three\nper cent. and to private people, upon good security, at four and four and\na-half, the present legal rate, five per cent. is perhaps as proper as\nany.\nThe legal rate, it is to be observed, though it ought to be somewhat\nabove, ought not to be much above the lowest market rate. If the legal\nrate of interest in Great Britain, for example, was fixed so high as eight\nor ten per cent. the greater part of the money which was to be lent, would\nbe lent to prodigals and projectors, who alone would be willing to give\nthis high interest. Sober people, who will give for the use of money no\nmore than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it, would\nnot venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of the\ncountry would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make\na profitable and advantageous use of it, and thrown into those which were\nmost likely to waste and destroy it. Where the legal rate of interest, on\nthe contrary, is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate,\nsober people are universally preferred, as borrowers, to prodigals and\nprojectors. The person who lends money gets nearly as much interest from\nthe former as he dares to take from the latter, and his money is much\nsafer in the hands of the one set of people than in those of the other. A\ngreat part of the capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in\nwhich it is most likely to be employed with advantage.\nNo law can reduce the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary\nmarket rate at the time when that law is made. Notwithstanding the edict\nof 1766, by which the French king attempted to reduce the rate of interest\nfrom five to four per cent. money continued to be lent in France at five\nper cent. the law being evaded in several different ways.\nThe ordinary market price of land, it is to be observed, depends\neverywhere upon the ordinary market rate of interest. The person who has a\ncapital from which he wishes to derive a revenue, without taking the\ntrouble to employ it himself, deliberates whether he should buy land with\nit, or lend it out at interest. The superior security of land, together\nwith some other advantages which almost everywhere attend upon this\nspecies of property, will generally dispose him to content himself with a\nsmaller revenue from land, than what he might have by lending out his\nmoney at interest. These advantages are sufficient to compensate a certain\ndifference of revenue; but they will compensate a certain difference only;\nand if the rent of land should fall short of the interest of money by a\ngreater difference, nobody would buy land, which would soon reduce its\nordinary price. On the contrary, if the advantages should much more than\ncompensate the difference, everybody would buy land, which again would\nsoon raise its ordinary price. When interest was at ten per cent. land was\ncommonly sold for ten or twelve years purchase. As interest sunk to six,\nfive, and four per cent. the price of land rose to twenty,\nfive-and-twenty, and thirty years purchase. The market rate of interest is\nhigher in France than in England, and the common price of land is lower.\nIn England it commonly sells at thirty, in France at twenty years\npurchase.\nCHAPTER V.\nOF THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS OF CAPITALS.\nThough all capitals are destined for the maintenance of productive labour\nonly, yet the quantity of that labour which equal capitals are capable of\nputting into motion, varies extremely according to the diversity of their\nemployment; as does likewise the value which that employment adds to the\nannual produce of the land and labour of the country.\nA capital may be employed in four different ways; either, first, in\nprocuring the rude produce annually required for the use and consumption\nof the society; or, secondly, in manufacturing and preparing that rude\nproduce for immediate use and consumption; or, thirdly in transporting\neither the rude or manufactured produce from the places where they abound\nto those where they are wanted; or, lastly, in dividing particular\nportions of either into such small parcels as suit the occasional demands\nof those who want them. In the first way are employed the capitals of all\nthose who undertake improvement or cultivation of lands, mines, or\nfisheries; in the second, those of all master manufacturers; in the third,\nthose of all wholesale merchants; and in the fourth, those of all\nretailers. It is difficult to conceive that a capital should be employed\nin any way which may not be classed under some one or other of those four.\nEach of those four methods of employing a capital is essentially\nnecessary, either to the existence or extension of the other three, or to\nthe general conveniency of the society.\nUnless a capital was employed in furnishing rude produce to a certain\ndegree of abundance, neither manufactures nor trade of any kind could\nexist.\nUnless a capital was employed in manufacturing that part of the rude\nproduce which requires a good deal of preparation before it can be fit for\nuse and consumption, it either would never be produced, because there\ncould be no demand for it; or if it was produced spontaneously, it would\nbe of no value in exchange, and could add nothing to the wealth of the\nsociety.\nUnless a capital was employed in transporting either the rude or\nmanufactured produce from the places where it abounds to those where it is\nwanted, no more of either could be produced than was necessary for the\nconsumption of the neighbourhood. The capital of the merchant exchanges\nthe surplus produce of one place for that of another, and thus encourages\nthe industry, and increases the enjoyments of both.\nUnless a capital was employed in breaking and dividing certain portions\neither of the rude or manufactured produce into such small parcels as suit\nthe occasional demands of those who want them, every man would be obliged\nto purchase a greater quantity of the goods he wanted than his immediate\noccasions required. If there was no such trade as a butcher, for example,\nevery man would be obliged to purchase a whole ox or a whole sheep at a\ntime. This would generally be inconvenient to the rich, and much more so\nto the poor. If a poor workman was obliged to purchase a month\u2019s or six\nmonths\u2019 provisions at a time, a great part of the stock which he employs\nas a capital in the instruments of his trade, or in the furniture of his\nshop, and which yields him a revenue, he would be forced to place in that\npart of his stock which is reserved for immediate consumption, and which\nyields him no revenue. Nothing can be more convenient for such a person\nthan to be able to purchase his subsistence from day to day, or even from\nhour to hour, as he wants it. He is thereby enabled to employ almost his\nwhole stock as a capital. He is thus enabled to furnish work to a greater\nvalue; and the profit which he makes by it in this way much more than\ncompensates the additional price which the profit of the retailer imposes\nupon the goods. The prejudices of some political writers against\nshopkeepers and tradesmen are altogether without foundation. So far is it\nfrom being necessary either to tax them, or to restrict their numbers,\nthat they can never be multiplied so as to hurt the public, though they\nmay so as to hurt one another. The quantity of grocery goods, for example,\nwhich can be sold in a particular town, is limited by the demand of that\ntown and its neighbourhood. The capital, therefore, which can be employed\nin the grocery trade, cannot exceed what is sufficient to purchase that\nquantity. If this capital is divided between two different grocers, their\ncompetition will tend to make both of them sell cheaper than if it were in\nthe hands of one only; and if it were divided among twenty, their\ncompetition would be just so much the greater, and the chance of their\ncombining together, in order to raise the price, just so much the less.\nTheir competition might, perhaps, ruin some of themselves; but to take\ncare of this, is the business of the parties concerned, and it may safely\nbe trusted to their discretion. It can never hurt either the consumer or\nthe producer; on the contrary, it must tend to make the retailers both\nsell cheaper and buy dearer, than if the whole trade was monopolised by\none or two persons. Some of them, perhaps, may sometimes decoy a weak\ncustomer to buy what he has no occasion for. This evil, however, is of too\nlittle importance to deserve the public attention, nor would it\nnecessarily be prevented by restricting their numbers. It is not the\nmultitude of alehouses, to give the must suspicious example, that\noccasions a general disposition to drunkenness among the common people;\nbut that disposition, arising from other causes, necessarily gives\nemployment to a multitude of alehouses.\nThe persons whose capitals are employed in any of those four ways, are\nthemselves productive labourers. Their labour, when properly directed,\nfixes and realizes itself in the subject or vendible commodity upon which\nit is bestowed, and generally adds to its price the value at least of\ntheir own maintenance and consumption. The profits of the farmer, of the\nmanufacturer, of the merchant, and retailer, are all drawn from the price\nof the goods which the two first produce, and the two last buy and sell.\nEqual capitals, however, employed in each of those four different ways,\nwill immediately put into motion very different quantities of productive\nlabour; and augment, too, in very different proportions, the value of the\nannual produce of the land and labour of the society to which they belong.\nThe capital of the retailer replaces, together with its profits, that of\nthe merchant of whom he purchases goods, and thereby enables him to\ncontinue his business. The retailer himself is the only productive\nlabourer whom it immediately employs. In his profit consists the whole\nvalue which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and\nlabour of the society.\nThe capital of the wholesale merchant replaces, together with their\nprofits, the capitals of the farmers and manufacturers of whom he\npurchases the rude and manufactured produce which he deals in, and thereby\nenables them to continue their respective trades. It is by this service\nchiefly that he contributes indirectly to support the productive labour of\nthe society, and to increase the value of its annual produce. His capital\nemploys, too, the sailors and carriers who transport his goods from one\nplace to another; and it augments the price of those goods by the value,\nnot only of his profits, but of their wages. This is all the productive\nlabour which it immediately puts into motion, and all the value which it\nimmediately adds to the annual produce. Its operation in both these\nrespects is a good deal superior to that of the capital of the retailer.\nPart of the capital of the master manufacturer is employed as a fixed\ncapital in the instruments of his trade, and replaces, together with its\nprofits, that of some other artificer of whom he purchases them. Part of\nhis circulating capital is employed in purchasing materials, and replaces,\nwith their profits, the capitals of the farmers and miners of whom he\npurchases them. But a great part of it is always, either annually, or in a\nmuch shorter period, distributed among the different workmen whom he\nemploys. It augments the value of those materials by their wages, and by\ntheir masters\u2019 profits upon the whole stock of wages, materials, and\ninstruments of trade employed in the business. It puts immediately into\nmotion, therefore, a much greater quantity of productive labour, and adds\na much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of the\nsociety, than an equal capital in the hands of any wholesale merchant.\nNo equal capital puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labour\nthan that of the farmer. Not only his labouring servants, but his\nlabouring cattle, are productive labourers. In agriculture, too, Nature\nlabours along with man; and though her labour costs no expense, its\nproduce has its value, as well as that of the most expensive workmen. The\nmost important operations of agriculture seem intended, not so much to\nincrease, though they do that too, as to direct the fertility of Nature\ntowards the production of the plants most profitable to man. A field\novergrown with briars and brambles, may frequently produce as great a\nquantity of vegetables as the best cultivated vineyard or corn field.\nPlanting and tillage frequently regulate more than they animate the active\nfertility of Nature; and after all their labour, a great part of the work\nalways remains to be done by her. The labourers and labouring cattle,\ntherefore, employed in agriculture, not only occasion, like the workmen in\nmanufactures, the reproduction of a value equal to their own consumption,\nor to the capital which employs them, together with its owner\u2019s profits,\nbut of a much greater value. Over and above the capital of the farmer, and\nall its profits, they regularly occasion the reproduction of the rent of\nthe landlord. This rent may be considered as the produce of those powers\nof Nature, the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer. It is\ngreater or smaller, according to the supposed extent of those powers, or,\nin other words, according to the supposed natural or improved fertility of\nthe land. It is the work of Nature which remains, after deducting or\ncompensating every thing which can be regarded as the work of man. It is\nseldom less than a fourth, and frequently more than a third, of the whole\nproduce. No equal quantity of productive labour employed in manufactures,\ncan ever occasion so great reproduction. In them Nature does nothing; man\ndoes all; and the reproduction must always be in proportion to the\nstrength of the agents that occasion it. The capital employed in\nagriculture, therefore, not only puts into motion a greater quantity of\nproductive labour than any equal capital employed in manufactures; but in\nproportion, too, to the quantity of productive labour which it employs, it\nadds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of\nthe country, to the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. Of all the\nways in which a capital can be employed, it is by far the most\nadvantageous to society.\nThe capitals employed in the agriculture and in the retail trade of any\nsociety, must always reside within that society. Their employment is\nconfined almost to a precise spot, to the farm, and to the shop of the\nretailer. They must generally, too, though there are some exceptions to\nthis, belong to resident members of the society.\nThe capital of a wholesale merchant, on the contrary, seems to have no\nfixed or necessary residence anywhere, but may wander about from place to\nplace, according as it can either buy cheap or sell dear.\nThe capital of the manufacturer must, no doubt, reside where the\nmanufacture is carried on; but where this shall be, is not always\nnecessarily determined. It may frequently be at a great distance, both\nfrom the place where the materials grow, and from that where the complete\nmanufacture is consumed. Lyons is very distant, both from the places which\nafford the materials of its manufactures, and from those which consume\nthem. The people of fashion in Sicily are clothed in silks made in other\ncountries, from the materials which their own produces. Part of the wool\nof Spain is manufactured in Great Britain, and some part of that cloth is\nafterwards sent back to Spain.\nWhether the merchant whose capital exports the surplus produce of any\nsociety, be a native or a foreigner, is of very little importance. If he\nis a foreigner, the number of their productive labourers is necessarily\nless than if he had been a native, by one man only; and the value of their\nannual produce, by the profits of that one man. The sailors or carriers\nwhom he employs, may still belong indifferently either to his country, or\nto their country, or to some third country, in the same manner as if he\nhad been a native. The capital of a foreigner gives a value to their\nsurplus produce equally with that of a native, by exchanging it for\nsomething for which there is a demand at home. It as effectually replaces\nthe capital of the person who produces that surplus, and as effectually\nenables him to continue his business, the service by which the capital of\na wholesale merchant chiefly contributes to support the productive labour,\nand to augment the value of the annual produce of the society to which he\nbelongs.\nIt is of more consequence that the capital of the manufacturer should\nreside within the country. It necessarily puts into motion a greater\nquantity of productive labour, and adds a greater value to the annual\nproduce of the land and labour of the society. It may, however, be very\nuseful to the country, though it should not reside within it. The capitals\nof the British manufacturers who work up the flax and hemp annually\nimported from the coasts of the Baltic, are surely very useful to the\ncountries which produce them. Those materials are a part of the surplus\nproduce of those countries, which, unless it was annually exchanged for\nsomething which is in demand there, would be of no value, and would soon\ncease to be produced. The merchants who export it, replace the capitals of\nthe people who produce it, and thereby encourage them to continue the\nproduction; and the British manufacturers replace the capitals of those\nmerchants.\nA particular country, in the same manner as a particular person, may\nfrequently not have capital sufficient both to improve and cultivate all\nits lands, to manufacture and prepare their whole rude produce for\nimmediate use and consumption, and to transport the surplus part either of\nthe rude or manufactured produce to those distant markets, where it can be\nexchanged for something for which there is a demand at home. The\ninhabitants of many different parts of Great Britain have not capital\nsufficient to improve and cultivate all their lands. The wool of the\nsouthern counties of Scotland is, a great part of it, after a long land\ncarriage through very bad roads, manufactured in Yorkshire, for want of a\ncapital to manufacture it at home. There are many little manufacturing\ntowns in Great Britain, of which the inhabitants have not capital\nsufficient to transport the produce of their own industry to those distant\nmarkets where there is demand and consumption for it. If there are any\nmerchants among them, they are, properly, only the agents of wealthier\nmerchants who reside in some of the great commercial cities.\nWhen the capital of any country is not sufficient for all those three\npurposes, in proportion as a greater share of it is employed in\nagriculture, the greater will be the quantity of productive labour which\nit puts into motion within the country; as will likewise be the value\nwhich its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labour of\nthe society. After agriculture, the capital employed in manufactures puts\ninto motion the greatest quantity of productive labour, and adds the\ngreatest value to the annual produce. That which is employed in the trade\nof exportation has the least effect of any of the three.\nThe country, indeed, which has not capital sufficient for all those three\npurposes, has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it seems\nnaturally destined. To attempt, however, prematurely, and with an\ninsufficient capital, to do all the three, is certainly not the shortest\nway for a society, no more than it would be for an individual, to acquire\na sufficient one. The capital of all the individuals of a nation has its\nlimits, in the same manner as that of a single individual, and is capable\nof executing only certain purposes. The capital of all the individuals of\na nation is increased in the same manner as that of a single individual,\nby their continually accumulating and adding to it whatever they save out\nof their revenue. It is likely to increase the fastest, therefore, when it\nis employed in the way that affords the greatest revenue to all the\ninhabitants or the country, as they will thus be enabled to make the\ngreatest savings. But the revenue of all the inhabitants of the country is\nnecessarily in proportion to the value of the annual produce of their land\nand labour.\nIt has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American\ncolonies towards wealth and greatness, that almost their whole capitals\nhave hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures,\nthose household and coarser manufactures excepted, which necessarily\naccompany the progress of agriculture, and which are the work of the women\nand children in every private family. The greater part, both of the\nexportation and coasting trade of America, is carried on by the capitals\nof merchants who reside in Great Britain. Even the stores and warehouses\nfrom which goods are retailed in some provinces, particularly in Virginia\nand Maryland, belong many of them to merchants who reside in the mother\ncountry, and afford one of the few instances of the retail trade of a\nsociety being carried on by the capitals of those who are not resident\nmembers of it. Were the Americans, either by combination, or by any other\nsort of violence, to stop the importation of European manufactures, and,\nby thus giving a monopoly to such of their own countrymen as could\nmanufacture the like goods, divert any considerable part of their capital\ninto this employment, they would retard, instead of accelerating, the\nfurther increase in the value of their annual produce, and would obstruct,\ninstead of promoting, the progress of their country towards real wealth\nand greatness. This would be still more the case, were they to attempt, in\nthe same manner, to monopolize to themselves their whole exportation\ntrade.\nThe course of human prosperity, indeed, seems scarce ever to have been of\nso long continuance as to enable any great country to acquire capital\nsufficient for all those three purposes; unless, perhaps, we give credit\nto the wonderful accounts of the wealth and cultivation of China, of those\nof ancient Egypt, and of the ancient state of Indostan. Even those three\ncountries, the wealthiest, according to all accounts, that ever were in\nthe world, are chiefly renowned for their superiority in agriculture and\nmanufactures. They do not appear to have been eminent for foreign trade.\nThe ancient Egyptians had a superstitious antipathy to the sea; a\nsuperstition nearly of the same kind prevails among the Indians; and the\nChinese have never excelled in foreign commerce. The greater part of the\nsurplus produce of all those three countries seems to have been always\nexported by foreigners, who gave in exchange for it something else, for\nwhich they found a demand there, frequently gold and silver.\nIt is thus that the same capital will in any country put into motion a\ngreater or smaller quantity of productive labour, and add a greater or\nsmaller value to the annual produce of its land and labour, according to\nthe different proportions in which it is employed in agriculture,\nmanufactures, and wholesale trade. The difference, too, is very great,\naccording to the different sorts of wholesale trade in which any part of\nit is employed.\nAll wholesale trade, all buying in order to sell again by wholesale, maybe\nreduced to three different sorts: the home trade, the foreign trade of\nconsumption, and the carrying trade. The home trade is employed in\npurchasing in one part of the same country, and selling in another, the\nproduce of the industry of that country. It comprehends both the inland\nand the coasting trade. The foreign trade of consumption is employed in\npurchasing foreign goods for home consumption. The carrying trade is\nemployed in transacting the commerce of foreign countries, or in carrying\nthe surplus produce of one to another.\nThe capital which is employed in purchasing in one part of the country, in\norder to sell in another, the produce of the industry of that country,\ngenerally replaces, by every such operation, two distinct capitals, that\nhad both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that country,\nand thereby enables them to continue that employment. When it sends out\nfrom the residence of the merchant a certain value of commodities, it\ngenerally brings back in return at least an equal value of other\ncommodities. When both are the produce of domestic industry, it\nnecessarily replaces, by every such operation, two distinct capitals,\nwhich had both been employed in supporting productive labour, and thereby\nenables them to continue that support. The capital which sends Scotch\nmanufactures to London, and brings back English corn and manufactures to\nEdinburgh, necessarily replaces, by every such operation, two British\ncapitals, which had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures\nof Great Britain.\nThe capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption,\nwhen this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry,\nreplaces, too, by every such operation, two distinct capitals; but one of\nthem only is employed in supporting domestic industry. The capital which\nsends British goods to Portugal, and brings back Portuguese goods to Great\nBritain, replaces, by every such operation, only one British capital. The\nother is a Portuguese one. Though the returns, therefore, of the foreign\ntrade of consumption, should be as quick as those of the home trade, the\ncapital employed in it will give but one half of the encouragement to the\nindustry or productive labour of the country.\nBut the returns of the foreign trade of consumption are very seldom so\nquick as those of the home trade. The returns of the home trade generally\ncome in before the end of the year, and sometimes three or four times in\nthe year. The returns of the foreign trade of consumption seldom come in\nbefore the end of the year, and sometimes not till after two or three\nyears. A capital, therefore, employed in the home trade, will sometimes\nmake twelve operations, or be sent out and returned twelve times, before a\ncapital employed in the foreign trade of consumption has made one. If the\ncapitals are equal, therefore, the one will give four-and-twenty times\nmore encouragement and support to the industry of the country than the\nother.\nThe foreign goods for home consumption may sometimes be purchased, not\nwith the produce of domestic industry but with some other foreign goods.\nThese last, however, must have been purchased, either immediately with the\nproduce of domestic industry, or with something else that had been\npurchased with it; for, the case of war and conquest excepted, foreign\ngoods can never be acquired, but in exchange for something that had been\nproduced at home, either immediately, or after two or more different\nexchanges. The effects, therefore, of a capital employed in such a\nround-about foreign trade of consumption, are, in every respect, the same\nas those of one employed in the most direct trade of the same kind, except\nthat the final returns are likely to be still more distant, as they must\ndepend upon the returns of two or three distinct foreign trades. If the\nhemp and flax of Riga are purchased with the tobacco of Virginia, which\nhad been purchased with British manufactures, the merchant must wait for\nthe returns of two distinct foreign trades, before he can employ the same\ncapital in repurchasing a like quantity of British manufactures. If the\ntobacco of Virginia had been purchased, not with British manufactures, but\nwith the sugar and rum of Jamaica, which had been purchased with those\nmanufactures, he must wait for the returns of three. If those two or three\ndistinct foreign trades should happen to be carried on by two or three\ndistinct merchants, of whom the second buys the goods imported by the\nfirst, and the third buys those imported by the second, in order to export\nthem again, each merchant, indeed, will, in this case, receive the returns\nof his own capital more quickly; but the final returns of the whole\ncapital employed in the trade will be just as slow as ever. Whether the\nwhole capital employed in such a round about trade belong to one merchant\nor to three, can make no difference with regard to the country, though it\nmay with regard to the particular merchants. Three times a greater capital\nmust in both cases be employed, in order to exchange a certain value of\nBritish manufactures for a certain quantity of flax and hemp, than would\nhave been necessary, had the manufactures and the flax and hemp been\ndirectly exchanged for one another. The whole capital employed, therefore,\nin such a round-about foreign trade of consumption, will generally give\nless encouragement and support to the productive labour of the country,\nthan an equal capital employed in a more direct trade of the same kind.\nWhatever be the foreign commodity with which the foreign goods for home\nconsumption are purchased, it can occasion no essential difference, either\nin the nature of the trade, or in the encouragement and support which it\ncan give to the productive labour of the country from which it is carried\non. If they are purchased with the gold of Brazil, for example, or with\nthe silver of Peru, this gold and silver, like the tobacco of Virginia,\nmust have been purchased with something that either was the produce of the\nindustry of the country, or that had been purchased with something else\nthat was so. So far, therefore, as the productive labour of the country is\nconcerned, the foreign trade of consumption, which is carried on by means\nof gold and silver, has all the advantages and all the inconveniencies of\nany other equally round-about foreign trade of consumption; and will\nreplace, just as fast, or just as slow, the capital which is immediately\nemployed in supporting that productive labour. It seems even to have one\nadvantage over any other equally round-about foreign trade. The\ntransportation of those metals from one place to another, on account of\ntheir small bulk and great value, is less expensive than that of almost\nany other foreign goods of equal value. Their freight is much less, and\ntheir insurance not greater; and no goods, besides, are less liable to\nsuffer by the carriage. An equal quantity of foreign goods, therefore, may\nfrequently be purchased with a smaller quantity of the produce of domestic\nindustry, by the intervention of gold and silver, than by that of any\nother foreign goods. The demand of the country may frequently, in this\nmanner, be supplied more completely, and at a smaller expense, than in any\nother. Whether, by the continual exportation of those metals, a trade of\nthis kind is likely to impoverish the country from which it is carried on\nin any other way, I shall have occasion to examine at great length\nhereafter.\nThat part of the capital of any country which is employed in the carrying\ntrade, is altogether withdrawn from supporting the productive labour of\nthat particular country, to support that of some foreign countries. Though\nit may replace, by every operation, two distinct capitals, yet neither of\nthem belongs to that particular country. The capital of the Dutch\nmerchant, which carries the corn of Poland to Portugal, and brings back\nthe fruits and wines of Portugal to Poland, replaces by every such\noperation two capitals, neither of which had been employed in supporting\nthe productive labour of Holland; but one of them in supporting that of\nPoland, and the other that of Portugal. The profits only return regularly\nto Holland, and constitute the whole addition which this trade necessarily\nmakes to the annual produce of the land and labour of that country. When,\nindeed, the carrying trade of any particular country is carried on with\nthe ships and sailors of that country, that part of the capital employed\nin it which pays the freight is distributed among, and puts into motion, a\ncertain number of productive labourers of that country. Almost all nations\nthat have had any considerable share of the carrying trade have, in fact,\ncarried it on in this manner. The trade itself has probably derived its\nname from it, the people of such countries being the carriers to other\ncountries. It does not, however, seem essential to the nature of the trade\nthat it should be so. A Dutch merchant may, for example, employ his\ncapital in transacting the commerce of Poland and Portugal, by carrying\npart of the surplus produce of the one to the other, not in Dutch, but in\nBritish bottoms. It maybe presumed, that he actually does so upon some\nparticular occasions. It is upon this account, however, that the carrying\ntrade has been supposed peculiarly advantageous to such a country as Great\nBritain, of which the defence and security depend upon the number of its\nsailors and shipping. But the same capital may employ as many sailors and\nshipping, either in the foreign trade of consumption, or even in the home\ntrade, when carried on by coasting vessels, as it could in the carrying\ntrade. The number of sailors and shipping which any particular capital can\nemploy, does not depend upon the nature of the trade, but partly upon the\nbulk of the goods, in proportion to their value, and partly upon the\ndistance of the ports between which they are to be carried; chiefly upon\nthe former of those two circumstances. The coal trade from Newcastle to\nLondon, for example, employs more shipping than all the carrying trade of\nEngland, though the ports are at no great distance. To force, therefore,\nby extraordinary encouragements, a larger share of the capital of any\ncountry into the carrying trade, than what would naturally go to it, will\nnot always necessarily increase the shipping of that country.\nThe capital, therefore, employed in the home trade of any country, will\ngenerally give encouragement and support to a greater quantity of\nproductive labour in that country, and increase the value of its annual\nproduce, more than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of\nconsumption; and the capital employed in this latter trade has, in both\nthese respects, a still greater advantage over an equal capital employed\nin the carrying trade. The riches, and so far as power depends upon\nriches, the power of every country must always be in proportion to the\nvalue of its annual produce, the fund from which all taxes must ultimately\nbe paid. But the great object of the political economy of every country,\nis to increase the riches and power of that country. It ought, therefore,\nto give no preference nor superior encouragement to the foreign trade of\nconsumption above the home trade, nor to the carrying trade above either\nof the other two. It ought neither to force nor to allure into either of\nthose two channels a greater share of the capital of the country, than\nwhat would naturally flow into them of its own accord.\nEach of those different branches of trade, however, is not only\nadvantageous, but necessary and unavoidable, when the course of things,\nwithout any constraint or violence, naturally introduces it.\nWhen the produce of any particular branch of industry exceeds what the\ndemand of the country requires, the surplus must be sent abroad, and\nexchanged for something for which there is a demand at home. Without such\nexportation, a part of the productive labour of the country must cease,\nand the value of its annual produce diminish. The land and labour of Great\nBritain produce generally more corn, woollens, and hardware, than the\ndemand of the home market requires. The surplus part of them, therefore,\nmust be sent abroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a\ndemand at home. It is only by means of such exportation, that this surplus\ncan acquire a value sufficient to compensate the labour and expense of\nproducing it. The neighbourhood of the sea-coast, and the banks of all\nnavigable rivers, are advantageous situations for industry, only because\nthey facilitate the exportation and exchange of such surplus produce for\nsomething else which is more in demand there.\nWhen the foreign goods which are thus purchased with the surplus produce\nof domestic industry exceed the demand of the home market, the surplus\npart of them must be sent abroad again, and exchanged for something more\nin demand at home. About 96,000 hogsheads of tobacco are annually\npurchased in Virginia and Maryland with a part of the surplus produce of\nBritish industry. But the demand of Great Britain does not require,\nperhaps, more than 14,000. If the remaining 82,000, therefore, could not\nbe sent abroad, and exchanged for something more in demand at home, the\nimportation of them must cease immediately, and with it the productive\nlabour of all those inhabitants of Great Britain who are at present\nemployed in preparing the goods with which these 82,000 hogsheads are\nannually purchased. Those goods, which are part of the produce of the land\nand labour of Great Britain, having no market at home, and being deprived\nof that which they had abroad, must cease to be produced. The most\nround-about foreign trade of consumption, therefore, may, upon some\noccasions, be as necessary for supporting the productive labour of the\ncountry, and the value of its annual produce, as the most direct.\nWhen the capital stock of any country is increased to such a degree that\nit cannot be all employed in supplying the consumption, and supporting the\nproductive labour of that particular country, the surplus part of it\nnaturally disgorges itself into the carrying trade, and is employed in\nperforming the same offices to other countries. The carrying trade is the\nnatural effect and symptom of great national wealth; but it does not seem\nto be the natural cause of it. Those statesmen who have been disposed to\nfavour it with particular encouragement, seem to have mistaken the effect\nand symptom for the cause. Holland, in proportion to the extent of the\nland and the number of its inhabitants, by far the richest country in\nEurope, has accordingly the greatest share of the carrying trade of\nEurope. England, perhaps the second richest country of Europe, is likewise\nsupposed to have a considerable share in it; though what commonly passes\nfor the carrying trade of England will frequently, perhaps, be found to be\nno more than a round-about foreign trade of consumption. Such are, in a\ngreat measure, the trades which carry the goods of the East and West\nIndies and of America to the different European markets. Those goods are\ngenerally purchased, either immediately with the produce of British\nindustry, or with something else which had been purchased with that\nproduce, and the final returns of those trades are generally used or\nconsumed in Great Britain. The trade which is carried on in British\nbottoms between the different ports of the Mediterranean, and some trade\nof the same kind carried on by British merchants between the different\nports of India, make, perhaps, the principal branches of what is properly\nthe carrying trade of Great Britain.\nThe extent of the home trade, and of the capital which can be employed in\nit, is necessarily limited by the value of the surplus produce of all\nthose distant places within the country which have occasion to exchange\ntheir respective productions with one another; that of the foreign trade\nof consumption, by the value of the surplus produce of the whole country,\nand of what can be purchased with it; that of the carrying trade, by the\nvalue of the surplus produce of all the different countries in the world.\nIts possible extent, therefore, is in a manner infinite in comparison of\nthat of the other two, and is capable of absorbing the greatest capitals.\nThe consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which\ndetermines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture, in\nmanufactures, or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail\ntrade. The different quantities of productive labour which it may put into\nmotion, and the different values which it may add to the annual produce of\nthe land and labour of the society, according as it is employed in one or\nother of those different ways, never enter into his thoughts. In\ncountries, therefore, where agriculture is the most profitable of all\nemployments, and farming and improving the most direct roads to a splendid\nfortune, the capitals of individuals will naturally be employed in the\nmanner most advantageous to the whole society. The profits of agriculture,\nhowever, seem to have no superiority over those of other employments in\nany part of Europe. Projectors, indeed, in every corner of it, have,\nwithin these few years, amused the public with most magnificent accounts\nof the profits to be made by the cultivation and improvement of land.\nWithout entering into any particular discussion of their calculations, a\nvery simple observation may satisfy us that the result of them must be\nfalse. We see, every day, the most splendid fortunes, that have been\nacquired in the course of a single life, by trade and manufactures,\nfrequently from a very small capital, sometimes from no capital. A single\ninstance of such a fortune, acquired by agriculture in the same time, and\nfrom such a capital, has not, perhaps, occurred in Europe, during the\ncourse of the present century. In all the great countries of Europe,\nhowever, much good land still remains uncultivated; and the greater part\nof what is cultivated, is far from being improved to the degree of which\nit is capable. Agriculture, therefore, is almost everywhere capable of\nabsorbing a much greater capital than has ever yet been employed in it.\nWhat circumstances in the policy of Europe have given the trades which are\ncarried on in towns so great an advantage over that which is carried on in\nthe country, that private persons frequently find it more for their\nadvantage to employ their capitals in the most distant carrying trades of\nAsia and America than in the improvement and cultivation of the most\nfertile fields in their own neighbourhood, I shall endeavour to explain at\nfull length in the two following books.\nBOOK III.\nOF THE DIFFERENT PROGRESS OF OPULENCE IN\nDIFFERENT NATIONS\nCHAPTER I.\nOF THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF OPULENCE.\nThe great commerce of every civilized society is that carried on between\nthe inhabitants of the town and those of the country. It consists in the\nexchange of rude for manufactured produce, either immediately, or by the\nintervention of money, or of some sort of paper which represents money.\nThe country supplies the town with the means of subsistence and the\nmaterials of manufacture. The town repays this supply, by sending back a\npart of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country. The\ntown, in which there neither is nor can be any reproduction of substances,\nmay very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and subsistence from\nthe country. We must not, however, upon this account, imagine that the\ngain of the town is the loss of the country. The gains of both are mutual\nand reciprocal, and the division of labour is in this, as in all other\ncases, advantageous to all the different persons employed in the various\noccupations into which it is subdivided. The inhabitants of the country\npurchase of the town a greater quantity of manufactured goods with the\nproduce of a much smaller quantity of their own labour, than they must\nhave employed had they attempted to prepare them themselves. The town\naffords a market for the surplus produce of the country, or what is over\nand above the maintenance of the cultivators; and it is there that the\ninhabitants of the country exchange it for something else which is in\ndemand among them. The greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants\nof the town, the more extensive is the market which it affords to those of\nthe country; and the more extensive that market, it is always the more\nadvantageous to a great number. The corn which grows within a mile of the\ntown, sells there for the same price with that which comes from twenty\nmiles distance. But the price of the latter must, generally, not only pay\nthe expense of raising it and bringing it to market, but afford, too, the\nordinary profits of agriculture to the farmer. The proprietors and\ncultivators of the country, therefore, which lies in the neighbourhood of\nthe town, over and above the ordinary profits of agriculture, gain, in the\nprice of what they sell, the whole value of the carriage of the like\nproduce that is brought from more distant parts; and they save, besides,\nthe whole value of this carriage in the price of what they buy. Compare\nthe cultivation of the lands in the neighbourhood of any considerable\ntown, with that of those which lie at some distance from it, and you will\neasily satisfy yourself how much the country is benefited by the commerce\nof the town. Among all the absurd speculations that have been propagated\nconcerning the balance of trade, it has never been pretended that either\nthe country loses by its commerce with the town, or the town by that with\nthe country which maintains it.\nAs subsistence is, in the nature of things, prior to conveniency and\nluxury, so the industry which procures the former, must necessarily be\nprior to that which ministers to the latter. The cultivation and\nimprovement of the country, therefore, which affords subsistence, must,\nnecessarily, be prior to the increase of the town, which furnishes only\nthe means of conveniency and luxury. It is the surplus produce of the\ncountry only, or what is over and above the maintenance of the\ncultivators, that constitutes the subsistence of the town, which can\ntherefore increase only with the increase of the surplus produce. The\ntown, indeed, may not always derive its whole subsistence from the country\nin its neighbourhood, or even from the territory to which it belongs, but\nfrom very distant countries; and this, though it forms no exception from\nthe general rule, has occasioned considerable variations in the progress\nof opulence in different ages and nations.\nThat order of things which necessity imposes, in general, though not in\nevery particular country, is in every particular country promoted by the\nnatural inclinations of man. If human institutions had never thwarted\nthose natural inclinations, the towns could nowhere have increased beyond\nwhat the improvement and cultivation of the territory in which they were\nsituated could support; till such time, at least, as the whole of that\nterritory was completely cultivated and improved. Upon equal, or nearly\nequal profits, most men will choose to employ their capitals, rather in\nthe improvement and cultivation of land, than either in manufactures or in\nforeign trade. The man who employs his capital in land, has it more under\nhis view and command; and his fortune is much less liable to accidents\nthan that of the trader, who is obliged frequently to commit it, not only\nto the winds and the waves, but to the more uncertain elements of human\nfolly and injustice, by giving great credits, in distant countries, to men\nwith whose character and situation he can seldom be thoroughly acquainted.\nThe capital of the landlord, on the contrary, which is fixed in the\nimprovement of his land, seems to be as well secured as the nature of\nhuman affairs can admit of. The beauty of the country, besides, the\npleasure of a country life, the tranquillity of mind which it promises,\nand, wherever the injustice of human laws does not disturb it, the\nindependency which it really affords, have charms that, more or less,\nattract everybody; and as to cultivate the ground was the original\ndestination of man, so, in every stage of his existence, he seems to\nretain a predilection for this primitive employment.\nWithout the assistance of some artificers, indeed, the cultivation of land\ncannot be carried on, but with great inconveniency and continual\ninterruption. Smiths, carpenters, wheelwrights and ploughwrights, masons\nand bricklayers, tanners, shoemakers, and tailors, are people whose\nservice the farmer has frequent occasion for. Such artificers, too, stand\noccasionally in need of the assistance of one another; and as their\nresidence is not, like that of the farmer, necessarily tied down to a\nprecise spot, they naturally settle in the neighbourhood of one another,\nand thus form a small town or village. The butcher, the brewer, and the\nbaker, soon join them, together with many other artificers and retailers,\nnecessary or useful for supplying their occasional wants, and who\ncontribute still further to augment the town. The inhabitants of the town,\nand those of the country, are mutually the servants of one another. The\ntown is a continual fair or market, to which the inhabitants of the\ncountry resort, in order to exchange their rude for manufactured produce.\nIt is this commerce which supplies the inhabitants of the town, both with\nthe materials of their work, and the means of their subsistence. The\nquantity of the finished work which they sell to the inhabitants of the\ncountry, necessarily regulates the quantity of the materials and\nprovisions which they buy. Neither their employment nor subsistence,\ntherefore, can augment, but in proportion to the augmentation of the\ndemand from the country for finished work; and this demand can augment\nonly in proportion to the extension of improvement and cultivation. Had\nhuman institutions, therefore, never disturbed the natural course of\nthings, the progressive wealth and increase of the towns would, in every\npolitical society, be consequential, and in proportion to the improvement\nand cultivation of the territory of country.\nIn our North American colonies, where uncultivated land is still to be had\nupon easy terms, no manufactures for distant sale have ever yet been\nestablished in any of their towns. When an artificer has acquired a little\nmore stock than is necessary for carrying on his own business in supplying\nthe neighbouring country, he does not, in North America, attempt to\nestablish with it a manufacture for more distant sale, but employs it in\nthe purchase and improvement of uncultivated land. From artificer he\nbecomes planter; and neither the large wages nor the easy subsistence\nwhich that country affords to artificers, can bribe him rather to work for\nother people than for himself. He feels that an artificer is the servant\nof his customers, from whom he derives his subsistence; but that a planter\nwho cultivates his own land, and derives his necessary subsistence from\nthe labour of his own family, is really a master, and independent of all\nthe world.\nIn countries, on the contrary, where there is either no uncultivated land,\nor none that can be had upon easy terms, every artificer who has acquired\nmore stock than he can employ in the occasional jobs of the neighbourhood,\nendeavours to prepare work for more distant sale. The smith erects some\nsort of iron, the weaver some sort of linen or woollen manufactory. Those\ndifferent manufactures come, in process of time, to be gradually\nsubdivided, and thereby improved and refined in a great variety of ways,\nwhich may easily be conceived, and which it is therefore unnecessary to\nexplain any farther.\nIn seeking for employment to a capital, manufactures are, upon equal or\nnearly equal profits, naturally preferred to foreign commerce, for the\nsame reason that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures. As\nthe capital of the landlord or farmer is more secure than that of the\nmanufacturer, so the capital of the manufacturer, being at all times more\nwithin his view and command, is more secure than that of the foreign\nmerchant. In every period, indeed, of every society, the surplus part both\nof the rude and manufactured produce, or that for which there is no demand\nat home, must be sent abroad, in order to be exchanged for something for\nwhich there is some demand at home. But whether the capital which carries\nthis surplus produce abroad be a foreign or a domestic one, is of very\nlittle importance. If the society has not acquired sufficient capital,\nboth to cultivate all its lands, and to manufacture in the completest\nmanner the whole of its rude produce, there is even a considerable\nadvantage that the rude produce should be exported by a foreign capital,\nin order that the whole stock of the society may be employed in more\nuseful purposes. The wealth of ancient Egypt, that of China and Indostan,\nsufficiently demonstrate that a nation may attain a very high degree of\nopulence, though the greater part of its exportation trade be carried on\nby foreigners. The progress of our North American and West Indian\ncolonies, would have been much less rapid, had no capital but what\nbelonged to themselves been employed in exporting their surplus produce.\nAccording to the natural course of things, therefore, the greater part of\nthe capital of every growing society is, first, directed to agriculture,\nafterwards to manufactures, and, last of all, to foreign commerce. This\norder of things is so very natural, that in every society that had any\nterritory, it has always, I believe, been in some degree observed. Some of\ntheir lands must have been cultivated before any considerable towns could\nbe established, and some sort of coarse industry of the manufacturing kind\nmust have been carried on in those towns, before they could well think of\nemploying themselves in foreign commerce.\nBut though this natural order of things must have taken place in some\ndegree in every such society, it has, in all the modern states of Europe,\nbeen in many respects entirely inverted. The foreign commerce of some of\ntheir cities has introduced all their finer manufactures, or such as were\nfit for distant sale; and manufactures and foreign commerce together have\ngiven birth to the principal improvements of agriculture. The manners and\ncustoms which the nature of their original government introduced, and\nwhich remained after that government was greatly altered, necessarily\nforced them into this unnatural and retrograde order.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF THE DISCOURAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE\nIN THE ANCIENT STATE OF EUROPE, AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\nWhen the German and Scythian nations overran the western provinces of the\nRoman empire, the confusions which followed so great a revolution lasted\nfor several centuries. The rapine and violence which the barbarians\nexercised against the ancient inhabitants, interrupted the commerce\nbetween the towns and the country. The towns were deserted, and the\ncountry was left uncultivated; and the western provinces of Europe, which\nhad enjoyed a considerable degree of opulence under the Roman empire, sunk\ninto the lowest state of poverty and barbarism. During the continuance of\nthose confusions, the chiefs and principal leaders of those nations\nacquired, or usurped to themselves, the greater part of the lands of those\ncountries. A great part of them was uncultivated; but no part of them,\nwhether cultivated or uncultivated, was left without a proprietor. All of\nthem were engrossed, and the greater part by a few great proprietors.\nThis original engrossing of uncultivated lands, though a great, might have\nbeen but a transitory evil. They might soon have been divided again, and\nbroke into small parcels, either by succession or by alienation. The law\nof primogeniture hindered them from being divided by succession; the\nintroduction of entails prevented their being broke into small parcels by\nalienation.\nWhen land, like moveables, is considered as the means only of subsistence\nand enjoyment, the natural law of succession divides it, like them, among\nall the children of the family; of all of whom the subsistence and\nenjoyment may be supposed equally dear to the father. This natural law of\nsuccession, accordingly, took place among the Romans who made no more\ndistinction between elder and younger, between male and female, in the\ninheritance of lands, than we do in the distribution of moveables. But\nwhen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of\npower and protection, it was thought better that it should descend\nundivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a\nsort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge,\nand in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He\nmade war according to his own discretion, frequently against his\nneighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed\nestate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those\nwho dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it,\nand to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the\nincursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to\ntake place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the\nsuccession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally\ntaken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first\ninstitution. That the power, and consequently the security of the\nmonarchy, may not be weakened by division, it must descend entire to one\nof the children. To which of them so important a preference shall be\ngiven, must be determined by some general rule, founded not upon the\ndoubtful distinctions of personal merit, but upon some plain and evident\ndifference which can admit of no dispute. Among the children of the same\nfamily there can be no indisputable difference but that of sex, and that\nof age. The male sex is universally preferred to the female; and when all\nother things are equal, the elder everywhere takes place of the younger.\nHence the origin of the right of primogeniture, and of what is called\nlineal succession.\nLaws frequently continue in force long after the circumstances which first\ngave occasion to them, and which could alone render them reasonable, are\nno more. In the present state of Europe, the proprietor of a single acre\nof land is as perfectly secure in his possession as the proprietor of\n100,000. The right of primogeniture, however, still continues to be\nrespected; and as of all institutions it is the fittest to support the\npride of family distinctions, it is still likely to endure for many\ncenturies. In every other respect, nothing can be more contrary to the\nreal interest of a numerous family, than a right which, in order to enrich\none, beggars all the rest of the children.\nEntails are the natural consequences of the law of primogeniture. They\nwere introduced to preserve a certain lineal succession, of which the law\nof primogeniture first gave the idea, and to hinder any part of the\noriginal estate from being carried out of the proposed line, either by\ngift, or device, or alienation; either by the folly, or by the misfortune\nof any of its successive owners. They were altogether unknown to the\nRomans. Neither their substitutions, nor fidei commisses, bear any\nresemblance to entails, though some French lawyers have thought proper to\ndress the modern institution in the language and garb of those ancient\nones.\nWhen great landed estates were a sort of principalities, entails might not\nbe unreasonable. Like what are called the fundamental laws of some\nmonarchies, they might frequently hinder the security of thousands from\nbeing endangered by the caprice or extravagance of one man. But in the\npresent state of Europe, when small as well as great estates derive their\nsecurity from the laws of their country, nothing can be more completely\nabsurd. They are founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions, the\nsupposition that every successive generation of men have not an equal\nright to the earth, and to all that it possesses; but that the property of\nthe present generation should be restrained and regulated according to the\nfancy of those who died, perhaps five hundred years ago. Entails, however,\nare still respected, through the greater part of Europe; In those\ncountries, particularly, in which noble birth is a necessary qualification\nfor the enjoyment either of civil or military honours. Entails are thought\nnecessary for maintaining this exclusive privilege of the nobility to the\ngreat offices and honours of their country; and that order having usurped\none unjust advantage over the rest of their fellow-citizens, lest their\npoverty should render it ridiculous, it is thought reasonable that they\nshould have another. The common law of England, indeed, is said to abhor\nperpetuities, and they are accordingly more restricted there than in any\nother European monarchy; though even England is not altogether without\nthem. In Scotland, more than one fifth, perhaps more than one third part\nof the whole lands in the country, are at present supposed to be under\nstrict entail.\nGreat tracts of uncultivated land were in this manner not only engrossed\nby particular families, but the possibility of their being divided again\nwas as much as possible precluded for ever. It seldom happens, however,\nthat a great proprietor is a great improver. In the disorderly times which\ngave birth to those barbarous institutions, the great proprietor was\nsufficiently employed in defending his own territories, or in extending\nhis jurisdiction and authority over those of his neighbours. He had no\nleisure to attend to the cultivation and improvement of land. When the\nestablishment of law and order afforded him this leisure, he often wanted\nthe inclination, and almost always the requisite abilities. If the expense\nof his house and person either equalled or exceeded his revenue, as it did\nvery frequently, he had no stock to employ in this manner. If he was an\neconomist, he generally found it more profitable to employ his annual\nsavings in new purchases than in the improvement of his old estate. To\nimprove land with profit, like all other commercial projects, requires an\nexact attention to small savings and small gains, of which a man born to a\ngreat fortune, even though naturally frugal, is very seldom capable. The\nsituation of such a person naturally disposes him to attend rather to\nornament, which pleases his fancy, than to profit, for which he has so\nlittle occasion. The elegance of his dress, of his equipage, of his house\nand household furniture, are objects which, from his infancy, he has been\naccustomed to have some anxiety about. The turn of mind which this habit\nnaturally forms, follows him when he comes to think of the improvement of\nland. He embellishes, perhaps, four or five hundred acres in the\nneighbourhood of his house, at ten times the expense which the land is\nworth after all his improvements; and finds, that if he was to improve his\nwhole estate in the same manner, and he has little taste for any other, he\nwould be a bankrupt before he had finished the tenth part of it. There\nstill remain, in both parts of the united kingdom, some great estates\nwhich have continued, without interruption, in the hands of the same\nfamily since the times of feudal anarchy. Compare the present condition of\nthose estates with the possessions of the small proprietors in their\nneighbourhood, and you will require no other argument to convince you how\nunfavourable such extensive property is to improvement.\nIf little improvement was to be expected from such great proprietors,\nstill less was to be hoped for from those who occupied the land under\nthem. In the ancient state of Europe, the occupiers of land were all\ntenants at will. They were all, or almost all, slaves, but their slavery\nwas of a milder kind than that known among the ancient Greeks and Romans,\nor even in our West Indian colonies. They were supposed to belong more\ndirectly to the land than to their master. They could, therefore, be sold\nwith it, but not separately. They could marry, provided it was with the\nconsent of their master; and he could not afterwards dissolve the marriage\nby selling the man and wife to different persons. If he maimed or murdered\nany of them, he was liable to some penalty, though generally but to a\nsmall one. They were not, however, capable of acquiring property. Whatever\nthey acquired was acquired to their master, and he could take it from them\nat pleasure. Whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on by\nmeans of such slaves, was properly carried on by their master. It was at\nhis expense. The seed, the cattle, and the instruments of husbandry, were\nall his. It was for his benefit. Such slaves could acquire nothing but\ntheir daily maintenance. It was properly the proprietor himself,\ntherefore, that in this case occupied his own lands, and cultivated them\nby his own bondmen. This species of slavery still subsists in Russia,\nPoland, Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and other parts of Germany. It is only\nin the western and south-western provinces of Europe that it has gradually\nbeen abolished altogether.\nBut if great improvements are seldom to be expected from great\nproprietors, they are least of all to be expected when they employ slaves\nfor their workmen. The experience of all ages and nations, I believe,\ndemonstrates that the work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only\ntheir maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any. A person who can\nacquire no property can have no other interest but to eat as much and to\nlabour as little as possible. Whatever work he does beyond what is\nsufficient to purchase his own maintenance, can be squeezed out of him by\nviolence only, and not by any interest of his own. In ancient Italy, how\nmuch the cultivation of corn degenerated, how unprofitable it became to\nthe master, when it fell under the management of slaves, is remarked both\nby Pliny and Columella. In the time of Aristotle, it had not been much\nbetter in ancient Greece. Speaking of the ideal republic described in the\nlaws of Plato, to maintain 5000 idle men (the number of warriors supposed\nnecessary for its defence), together with their women and servants, would\nrequire, he says, a territory of boundless extent and fertility, like the\nplains of Babylon.\nThe pride of man makes him love to domineer, and nothing mortifies him so\nmuch as to be obliged to condescend to persuade his inferiors. Wherever\nthe law allows it, and the nature of the work can afford it, therefore, he\nwill generally prefer the service of slaves to that of freemen. The\nplanting of sugar and tobacco can afford the expense of slave cultivation.\nThe raising of corn, it seems, in the present times, cannot. In the\nEnglish colonies, of which the principal produce is corn, the far greater\npart of the work is done by freemen. The late resolution of the Quakers in\nPennsylvania, to set at liberty all their negro slaves, may satisfy us\nthat their number cannot be very great. Had they made any considerable\npart of their property, such a resolution could never have been agreed to.\nIn our sugar colonies., on the contrary, the whole work is done by slaves,\nand in our tobacco colonies a very great part of it. The profits of a\nsugar plantation in any of our West Indian colonies, are generally much\ngreater than those of any other cultivation that is known either in Europe\nor America; and the profits of a tobacco plantation, though inferior to\nthose of sugar, are superior to those of corn, as has already been\nobserved. Both can afford the expense of slave cultivation but sugar can\nafford it still better than tobacco. The number of negroes, accordingly,\nis much greater, in proportion to that of whites, in our sugar than in our\ntobacco colonies.\nTo the slave cultivators of ancient times gradually succeeded a species of\nfarmers, known at present in France by the name of metayers. They are\ncalled in Latin Coloni Partiarii. They have been so long in disuse in\nEngland, that at present I know no English name for them. The proprietor\nfurnished them with the seed, cattle, and instruments of husbandry, the\nwhole stock, in short, necessary for cultivating the farm. The produce was\ndivided equally between the proprietor and the farmer, after setting aside\nwhat was judged necessary for keeping up the stock, which was restored to\nthe proprietor, when the farmer either quitted or was turned out of the\nfarm.\nLand occupied by such tenants is properly cultivated at the expense of the\nproprietors, as much as that occupied by slaves. There is, however, one\nvery essential difference between them. Such tenants, being freemen, are\ncapable of acquiring property; and having a certain proportion of the\nproduce of the land, they have a plain interest that the whole produce\nshould be as great as possible, in order that their own proportion may be\nso. A slave, on the contrary, who can acquire nothing but his maintenance,\nconsults his own ease, by making the land produce as little as possible\nover and above that maintenance. It is probable that it was partly upon\naccount of this advantage, and partly upon account of the encroachments\nwhich the sovereigns, always jealous of the great lords, gradually\nencouraged their villains to make upon their authority, and which seem, at\nleast, to have been such as rendered this species of servitude altogether\ninconvenient, that tenure in villanage gradually wore out through the\ngreater part of Europe. The time and manner, however, in which so\nimportant a revolution was brought about, is one of the most obscure\npoints in modern history. The church of Rome claims great merit in it; and\nit is certain, that so early as the twelfth century, Alexander III.\npublished a bull for the general emancipation of slaves. It seems,\nhowever, to have been rather a pious exhortation, than a law to which\nexact obedience was required from the faithful. Slavery continued to take\nplace almost universally for several centuries afterwards, till it was\ngradually abolished by the joint operation of the two interests above\nmentioned; that of the proprietor on the one hand, and that of the\nsovereign on the other. A villain, enfranchised, and at the same time\nallowed to continue in possession of the land, having no stock of his own,\ncould cultivate it only by means of what the landlord advanced to him, and\nmust therefore have been what the French call a metayer.\nIt could never, however, be the interest even of this last species of\ncultivators, to lay out, in the further improvement of the land, any part\nof the little stock which they might save from their own share of the\nproduce; because the landlord, who laid out nothing, was to get one half\nof whatever it produced. The tithe, which is but a tenth of the produce,\nis found to be a very great hindrance to improvement. A tax, therefore,\nwhich amounted to one half, must have been an effectual bar to it. It\nmight be the interest of a metayer to make the land produce as much as\ncould be brought out of it by means of the stock furnished by the\nproprietor; but it could never be his interest to mix any part of his own\nwith it. In France, where five parts out of six of the whole kingdom are\nsaid to be still occupied by this species of cultivators, the proprietors\ncomplain, that their metayers take every opportunity of employing their\nmaster\u2019s cattle rather in carriage than in cultivation; because, in the\none case, they get the whole profits to themselves, in the other they\nshare them with their landlord. This species of tenants still subsists in\nsome parts of Scotland. They are called steel-bow tenants. Those ancient\nEnglish tenants, who are said by Chief-Baron Gilbert and Dr Blackstone to\nhave been rather bailiffs of the landlord than farmers, properly so\ncalled, were probably of the same kind.\nTo this species of tenantry succeeded, though by very slow degrees,\nfarmers, properly so called, who cultivated the land with their own stock,\npaying a rent certain to the landlord. When such farmers have a lease for\na term of years, they may sometimes find it for their interest to lay out\npart of their capital in the further improvement of the farm; because they\nmay sometimes expect to recover it, with a large profit, before the\nexpiration of the lease. The possession, even of such farmers, however,\nwas long extremely precarious, and still is so in many parts of Europe.\nThey could, before the expiration of their term, be legally ousted of\ntheir leases by a new purchaser; in England, even, by the fictitious\naction of a common recovery. If they were turned out illegally by the\nviolence of their master, the action by which they obtained redress was\nextremely imperfect. It did not always reinstate them in the possession of\nthe land, but gave them damages, which never amounted to a real loss. Even\nin England, the country, perhaps of Europe, where the yeomanry has always\nbeen most respected, it was not till about the 14th of Henry VII. that the\naction of ejectment was invented, by which the tenant recovers, not\ndamages only, but possession, and in which his claim is not necessarily\nconcluded by the uncertain decision of a single assize. This action has\nbeen found so effectual a remedy, that, in the modern practice, when the\nlandlord has occasion to sue for the possession of the land, he seldom\nmakes use of the actions which properly belong to him as a landlord, the\nwrit of right or the writ of entry, but sues in the name of his tenant, by\nthe writ of ejectment. In England, therefore the security of the tenant is\nequal to that of the proprietor. In England, besides, a lease for life of\nforty shillings a-year value is a freehold, and entitles the lessee to a\nvote for a member of parliament; and as a great part of the yeomanry have\nfreeholds of this kind, the whole order becomes respectable to their\nlandlords, on account of the political consideration which this gives\nthem. There is, I believe, nowhere in Europe, except in England, any\ninstance of the tenant building upon the land of which he had no lease,\nand trusting that the honour of his landlord would take no advantage of so\nimportant an improvement. Those laws and customs, so favourable to the\nyeomanry, have perhaps contributed more to the present grandeur of\nEngland, than all their boasted regulations of commerce taken together.\nThe law which secures the longest leases against successors of every kind,\nis, so far as I know, peculiar to Great Britain. It was introduced into\nScotland so early as 1449, by a law of James II. Its beneficial influence,\nhowever, has been much obstructed by entails; the heirs of entail being\ngenerally restrained from letting leases for any long term of years,\nfrequently for more than one year. A late act of parliament has, in this\nrespect, somewhat slackened their fetters, though they are still by much\ntoo strait. In Scotland, besides, as no leasehold gives a vote for a\nmember of parliament, the yeomanry are upon this account less respectable\nto their landlords than in England.\nIn other parts of Europe, after it was found convenient to secure tenants\nboth against heirs and purchasers, the term of their security was still\nlimited to a very short period; in France, for example, to nine years from\nthe commencement of the lease. It has in that country, indeed, been lately\nextended to twentyseven, a period still too short to encourage the tenant\nto make the most important improvements. The proprietors of land were\nanciently the legislators of every part of Europe. The laws relating to\nland, therefore, were all calculated for what they supposed the interest\nof the proprietor. It was for his interest, they had imagined, that no\nlease granted by any of his predecessors should hinder him from enjoying,\nduring a long term of years, the full value of his land. Avarice and\ninjustice are always short-sighted, and they did not foresee how much this\nregulation must obstruct improvement, and thereby hurt, in the long-run,\nthe real interest of the landlord.\nThe farmers, too, besides paying the rent, were anciently, it was\nsupposed, bound to perform a great number of services to the landlord,\nwhich were seldom either specified in the lease, or regulated by any\nprecise rule, but by the use and wont of the manor or barony. These\nservices, therefore, being almost entirely arbitrary, subjected the tenant\nto many vexations. In Scotland the abolition of all services not precisely\nstipulated in the lease, has, in the course of a few years, very much\naltered for the better the condition of the yeomanry of that country.\nThe public services to which the yeomanry were bound, were not less\narbitrary than the private ones. To make and maintain the high roads, a\nservitude which still subsists, I believe, everywhere, though with\ndifferent degrees of oppression in different countries, was not the only\none. When the king\u2019s troops, when his household, or his officers of any\nkind, passed through any part of the country, the yeomanry were bound to\nprovide them with horses, carriages, and provisions, at a price regulated\nby the purveyor. Great Britain is, I believe, the only monarchy in Europe\nwhere the oppression of purveyance has been entirely abolished. It still\nsubsists in France and Germany.\nThe public taxes, to which they were subject, were as irregular and\noppressive as the services. The ancient lords, though extremely unwilling\nto grant, themselves, any pecuniary aid to their sovereign, easily allowed\nhim to tallage, as they called it, their tenants, and had not knowledge\nenough to foresee how much this must, in the end, affect their own\nrevenue. The taille, as it still subsists in France may serve as an\nexample of those ancient tallages. It is a tax upon the supposed profits\nof the farmer, which they estimate by the stock that he has upon the farm.\nIt is his interest, therefore, to appear to have as little as possible,\nand consequently to employ as little as possible in its cultivation, and\nnone in its improvement. Should any stock happen to accumulate in the\nhands of a French farmer, the taille is almost equal to a prohibition of\nits ever being employed upon the land. This tax, besides, is supposed to\ndishonour whoever is subject to it, and to degrade him below, not only the\nrank of a gentleman, but that of a burgher; and whoever rents the lands of\nanother becomes subject to it. No gentleman, nor even any burgher, who has\nstock, will submit to this degradation. This tax, therefore, not only\nhinders the stock which accumulates upon the land from being employed in\nits improvement, but drives away all other stock from it. The ancient\ntenths and fifteenths, so usual in England in former times, seem, so far\nas they affected the land, to have been taxes of the same nature with the\ntaille.\nUnder all these discouragements, little improvement could be expected from\nthe occupiers of land. That order of people, with all the liberty and\nsecurity which law can give, must always improve under great disadvantage.\nThe farmer, compared with the proprietor, is as a merchant who trades with\nburrowed money, compared with one who trades with his own. The stock of\nboth may improve; but that of the one, with only equal good conduct, must\nalways improve more slowly than that of the other, on account of the large\nshare of the profits which is consumed by the interest of the loan. The\nlands cultivated by the farmer must, in the same manner, with only equal\ngood conduct, be improved more slowly than those cultivated by the\nproprietor, on account of the large share of the produce which is consumed\nin the rent, and which, had the farmer been proprietor, he might have\nemployed in the further improvement of the land. The station of a farmer,\nbesides, is, from the nature of things, inferior to that of a proprietor.\nThrough the greater part of Europe, the yeomanry are regarded as an\ninferior rank of people, even to the better sort of tradesmen and\nmechanics, and in all parts of Europe to the great merchants and master\nmanufacturers. It can seldom happen, therefore, that a man of any\nconsiderable stock should quit the superior, in order to place himself in\nan inferior station. Even in the present state of Europe, therefore,\nlittle stock is likely to go from any other profession to the improvement\nof land in the way of farming. More does, perhaps, in Great Britain than\nin any other country, though even there the great stocks which are in some\nplaces employed in farming, have generally been acquired by fanning, the\ntrade, perhaps, in which, of all others, stock is commonly acquired most\nslowly. After small proprietors, however, rich and great farmers are in\nevery country the principal improvers. There are more such, perhaps, in\nEngland than in any other European monarchy. In the republican governments\nof Holland, and of Berne in Switzerland, the farmers are said to be not\ninferior to those of England.\nThe ancient policy of Europe was, over and above all this, unfavourable to\nthe improvement and cultivation of land, whether carried on by the\nproprietor or by the farmer; first, by the general prohibition of the\nexportation of corn, without a special licence, which seems to have been a\nvery universal regulation; and, secondly, by the restraints which were\nlaid upon the inland commerce, not only of corn, but of almost every other\npart of the produce of the farm, by the absurd laws against engrossers,\nregraters, and forestallers, and by the privileges of fairs and markets.\nIt has already been observed in what manner the prohibition of the\nexportation of corn, together with some encouragement given to the\nimportation of foreign corn, obstructed the cultivation of ancient Italy,\nnaturally the most fertile country in Europe, and at that time the seat of\nthe greatest empire in the world. To what degree such restraints upon the\ninland commerce of this commodity, joined to the general prohibition of\nexportation, must have discouraged the cultivation of countries less\nfertile, and less favourably circumstanced, it is not, perhaps, very easy\nto imagine.\nCHAPTER III.\nOF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF CITIES\nAND TOWNS, AFTER THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\nThe inhabitants of cities and towns were, after the fall of the Roman\nempire, not more favoured than those of the country. They consisted,\nindeed, of a very different order of people from the first inhabitants of\nthe ancient republics of Greece and Italy. These last were composed\nchiefly of the proprietors of lands, among whom the public territory was\noriginally divided, and who found it convenient to build their houses in\nthe neighbourhood of one another, and to surround them with a wall, for\nthe sake of common defence. After the fall of the Roman empire, on the\ncontrary, the proprietors of land seem generally to have lived in\nfortified castles on their own estates, and in the midst of their own\ntenants and dependants. The towns were chiefly inhabited by tradesmen and\nmechanics, who seem, in those days, to have been of servile, or very\nnearly of servile condition. The privileges which we find granted by\nancient charters to the inhabitants of some of the principal towns in\nEurope, sufficiently show what they were before those grants. The people\nto whom it is granted as a privilege, that they might give away their own\ndaughters in marriage without the consent of their lord, that upon their\ndeath their own children, and not their lord, should succeed to their\ngoods, and that they might dispose of their own effects by will, must,\nbefore those grants, have been either altogether, or very nearly, in the\nsame state of villanage with the occupiers of land in the country.\nThey seem, indeed, to have been a very poor, mean set of people, who\nseemed to travel about with their goods from place to place, and from fair\nto fair, like the hawkers and pedlars of the present times. In all the\ndifferent countries of Europe then, in the same manner as in several of\nthe Tartar governments of Asia at present, taxes used to be levied upon\nthe persons and goods of travellers, when they passed through certain\nmanors, when they went over certain bridges, when they carried about their\ngoods from place to place in a fair, when they erected in it a booth or\nstall to sell them in. These different taxes were known in England by the\nnames of passage, pontage, lastage, and stallage. Sometimes the king,\nsometimes a great lord, who had, it seems, upon some occasions, authority\nto do this, would grant to particular traders, to such particularly as\nlived in their own demesnes, a general exemption from such taxes. Such\ntraders, though in other respects of servile, or very nearly of servile\ncondition, were upon this account called free traders. They, in return,\nusually paid to their protector a sort of annual poll-tax. In those days\nprotection was seldom granted without a valuable consideration, and this\ntax might perhaps be considered as compensation for what their patrons\nmight lose by their exemption from other taxes. At first, both those\npoll-taxes and those exemptions seem to have been altogether personal, and\nto have affected only particular individuals, during either their lives,\nor the pleasure of their protectors. In the very imperfect accounts which\nhave been published from Doomsday-book, of several of the towns of\nEngland, mention is frequently made, sometimes of the tax which particular\nburghers paid, each of them, either to the king, or to some other great\nlord, for this sort of protection, and sometimes of the general amount\nonly of all those taxes. {see Brady\u2019s Historical Treatise of Cities and\nBoroughs, p. 3. etc.}\nBut how servile soever may have been originally the condition of the\ninhabitants of the towns, it appears evidently, that they arrived at\nliberty and independency much earlier than the occupiers of land in the\ncountry. That part of the king\u2019s revenue which arose from such poll-taxes\nin any particular town, used commonly to be let in farm, during a term of\nyears, for a rent certain, sometimes to the sheriff of the county, and\nsometimes to other persons. The burghers themselves frequently got credit\nenough to be admitted to farm the revenues of this sort which arose out of\ntheir own town, they becoming jointly and severally answerable for the\nwhole rent. {See Madox, Firma Burgi, p. 18; also History of the Exchequer,\nchap. 10, sect. v, p. 223, first edition.} To let a farm in this manner,\nwas quite agreeable to the usual economy of, I believe, the sovereigns of\nall the different countries of Europe, who used frequently to let whole\nmanors to all the tenants of those manors, they becoming jointly and\nseverally answerable for the whole rent; but in return being allowed to\ncollect it in their own way, and to pay it into the king\u2019s exchequer by\nthe hands of their own bailiff, and being thus altogether freed from the\ninsolence of the king\u2019s officers; a circumstance in those days regarded as\nof the greatest importance.\nAt first, the farm of the town was probably let to the burghers, in the\nsame manner as it had been to other farmers, for a term of years only. In\nprocess of time, however, it seems to have become the general practice to\ngrant it to them in fee, that is for ever, reserving a rent certain, never\nafterwards to be augmented. The payment having thus become perpetual, the\nexemptions, in return, for which it was made, naturally became perpetual\ntoo. Those exemptions, therefore, ceased to be personal, and could not\nafterwards be considered as belonging to individuals, as individuals, but\nas burghers of a particular burgh, which, upon this account, was called a\nfree burgh, for the same reason that they had been called free burghers or\nfree traders.\nAlong with this grant, the important privileges, above mentioned, that\nthey might give away their own daughters in marriage, that their children\nshould succeed to them, and that they might dispose of their own effects\nby will, were generally bestowed upon the burghers of the town to whom it\nwas given. Whether such privileges had before been usually granted, along\nwith the freedom of trade, to particular burghers, as individuals, I know\nnot. I reckon it not improbable that they were, though I cannot produce\nany direct evidence of it. But however this may have been, the principal\nattributes of villanage and slavery being thus taken away from them, they\nnow at least became really free, in our present sense of the word freedom.\nNor was this all. They were generally at the same time erected into a\ncommonalty or corporation, with the privilege of having magistrates and a\ntown-council of their own, of making bye-laws for their own government, of\nbuilding walls for their own defence, and of reducing all their\ninhabitants under a sort of military discipline, by obliging them to watch\nand ward; that is, as anciently understood, to guard and defend those\nwalls against all attacks and surprises, by night as well as by day. In\nEngland they were generally exempted from suit to the hundred and county\ncourts: and all such pleas as should arise among them, the pleas of the\ncrown excepted, were left to the decision of their own magistrates. In\nother countries, much greater and more extensive jurisdictions were\nfrequently granted to them. {See Madox, Firma Burgi. See also Pfeffel in\nthe Remarkable events under Frederick II. and his Successors of the House\nof Suabia.}\nIt might, probably, be necessary to grant to such towns as were admitted\nto farm their own revenues, some sort of compulsive jurisdiction to oblige\ntheir own citizens to make payment. In those disorderly times, it might\nhave been extremely inconvenient to have left them to seek this sort of\njustice from any other tribunal. But it must seem extraordinary, that the\nsovereigns of all the different countries of Europe should have exchanged\nin this manner for a rent certain, never more to be augmented, that branch\nof their revenue, which was, perhaps, of all others, the most likely to be\nimproved by the natural course of things, without either expense or\nattention of their own; and that they should, besides, have in this manner\nvoluntarily erected a sort of independent republics in the heart of their\nown dominions.\nIn order to understand this, it must be remembered, that, in those days,\nthe sovereign of perhaps no country in Europe was able to protect, through\nthe whole extent of his dominions, the weaker part of his subjects from\nthe oppression of the great lords. Those whom the law could not protect,\nand who were not strong enough to defend themselves, were obliged either\nto have recourse to the protection of some great lord, and in order to\nobtain it, to become either his slaves or vassals; or to enter into a\nleague of mutual defence for the common protection of one another. The\ninhabitants of cities and burghs, considered as single individuals, had no\npower to defend themselves; but by entering into a league of mutual\ndefence with their neighbours, they were capable of making no contemptible\nresistance. The lords despised the burghers, whom they considered not only\nas a different order, but as a parcel of emancipated slaves, almost of a\ndifferent species from themselves. The wealth of the burghers never failed\nto provoke their envy and indignation, and they plundered them upon every\noccasion without mercy or remorse. The burghers naturally hated and feared\nthe lords. The king hated and feared them too; but though, perhaps, he\nmight despise, he had no reason either to hate or fear the burghers.\nMutual interest, therefore, disposed them to support the king, and the\nking to support them against the lords. They were the enemies of his\nenemies, and it was his interest to render them as secure and independent\nof those enemies as he could. By granting them magistrates of their own,\nthe privilege of making bye-laws for their own government, that of\nbuilding walls for their own defence, and that of reducing all their\ninhabitants under a sort of military discipline, he gave them all the\nmeans of security and independency of the barons which it was in his power\nto bestow. Without the establishment of some regular government of this\nkind, without some authority to compel their inhabitants to act according\nto some certain plan or system, no voluntary league of mutual defence\ncould either have afforded them any permanent security, or have enabled\nthem to give the king any considerable support. By granting them the farm\nof their own town in fee, he took away from those whom he wished to have\nfor his friends, and, if one may say so, for his allies, all ground of\njealousy and suspicion, that he was ever afterwards to oppress them,\neither by raising the farm-rent of their town, or by granting it to some\nother farmer.\nThe princes who lived upon the worst terms with their barons, seem\naccordingly to have been the most liberal in grants of this kind to their\nburghs. King John of England, for example, appears to have been a most\nmunificent benefactor to his towns. {See Madox.} Philip I. of France lost\nall authority over his barons. Towards the end of his reign, his son\nLewis, known afterwards by the name of Lewis the Fat, consulted, according\nto Father Daniel, with the bishops of the royal demesnes, concerning the\nmost proper means of restraining the violence of the great lords. Their\nadvice consisted of two different proposals. One was to erect a new order\nof jurisdiction, by establishing magistrates and a town-council in every\nconsiderable town of his demesnes. The other was to form a new militia, by\nmaking the inhabitants of those towns, under the command of their own\nmagistrates, march out upon proper occasions to the assistance of the\nking. It is from this period, according to the French antiquarians, that\nwe are to date the institution of the magistrates and councils of cities\nin France. It was during the unprosperous reigns of the princes of the\nhouse of Suabia, that the greater part of the free towns of Germany\nreceived the first grants of their privileges, and that the famous\nHanseatic league first became formidable. {See Pfeffel.}\nThe militia of the cities seems, in those times, not to have been inferior\nto that of the country; and as they could be more readily assembled upon\nany sudden occasion, they frequently had the advantage in their disputes\nwith the neighbouring lords. In countries such as Italy or Switzerland, in\nwhich, on account either of their distance from the principal seat of\ngovernment, of the natural strength of the country itself, or of some\nother reason, the sovereign came to lose the whole of his authority; the\ncities generally became independent republics, and conquered all the\nnobility in their neighbourhood; obliging them to pull down their castles\nin the country, and to live, like other peaceable inhabitants, in the\ncity. This is the short history of the republic of Berne, as well as of\nseveral other cities in Switzerland. If you except Venice, for of that\ncity the history is somewhat different, it is the history of all the\nconsiderable Italian republics, of which so great a number arose and\nperished between the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury.\nIn countries such as France and England, where the authority of the\nsovereign, though frequently very low, never was destroyed altogether, the\ncities had no opportunity of becoming entirely independent. They became,\nhowever, so considerable, that the sovereign could impose no tax upon\nthem, besides the stated farm-rent of the town, without their own consent.\nThey were, therefore, called upon to send deputies to the general assembly\nof the states of the kingdom, where they might join with the clergy and\nthe barons in granting, upon urgent occasions, some extraordinary aid to\nthe king. Being generally, too, more favourable to his power, their\ndeputies seem sometimes to have been employed by him as a counterbalance\nin those assemblies to the authority of the great lords. Hence the origin\nof the representation of burghs in the states-general of all great\nmonarchies in Europe.\nOrder and good government, and along with them the liberty and security of\nindividuals, were in this manner established in cities, at a time when the\noccupiers of land in the country, were exposed to every sort of violence.\nBut men in this defenceless state naturally content themselves with their\nnecessary subsistence; because, to acquire more, might only tempt the\ninjustice of their oppressors. On the contrary, when they are secure of\nenjoying the fruits of their industry, they naturally exert it to better\ntheir condition, and to acquire not only the necessaries, but the\nconveniencies and elegancies of life. That industry, therefore, which aims\nat something more than necessary subsistence, was established in cities\nlong before it was commonly practised by the occupiers of land in the\ncountry. If, in the hands of a poor cultivator, oppressed with the\nservitude of villanage, some little stock should accumulate, he would\nnaturally conceal it with great care from his master, to whom it would\notherwise have belonged, and take the first opportunity of running away to\na town. The law was at that time so indulgent to the inhabitants of towns,\nand so desirous of diminishing the authority of the lords over those of\nthe country, that if he could conceal himself there from the pursuit of\nhis lord for a year, he was free for ever. Whatever stock, therefore,\naccumulated in the hands of the industrious part of the inhabitants of the\ncountry, naturally took refuge in cities, as the only sanctuaries in which\nit could be secure to the person that acquired it.\nThe inhabitants of a city, it is true, must always ultimately derive their\nsubsistence, and the whole materials and means of their industry, from the\ncountry. But those of a city, situated near either the sea-coast or the\nbanks of a navigable river, are not necessarily confined to derive them\nfrom the country in their neighbourhood. They have a much wider range, and\nmay draw them from the most remote corners of the world, either in\nexchange for the manufactured produce of their own industry, or by\nperforming the office of carriers between distant countries, and\nexchanging the produce of one for that of another. A city might, in this\nmanner, grow up to great wealth and splendour, while not only the country\nin its neighbourhood, but all those to which it traded, were in poverty\nand wretchedness. Each of those countries, perhaps, taken singly, could\nafford it but a small part, either of its subsistence or of its\nemployment; but all of them taken together, could afford it both a great\nsubsistence and a great employment. There were, however, within the narrow\ncircle of the commerce of those times, some countries that were opulent\nand industrious. Such was the Greek empire as long as it subsisted, and\nthat of the Saracens during the reigns of the Abassides. Such, too, was\nEgypt till it was conquered by the Turks, some part of the coast of\nBarbary, and all those provinces of Spain which were under the government\nof the Moors.\nThe cities of Italy seem to have been the first in Europe which were\nraised by commerce to any considerable degree of opulence. Italy lay in\nthe centre of what was at that time the improved and civilized part of the\nworld. The crusades, too, though, by the great waste of stock and\ndestruction of inhabitants which they occasioned, they must necessarily\nhave retarded the progress of the greater part of Europe, were extremely\nfavourable to that of some Italian cities. The great armies which marched\nfrom all parts to the conquest of the Holy Land, gave extraordinary\nencouragement to the shipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, sometimes in\ntransporting them thither, and always in supplying them with provisions.\nThey were the commissaries, if one may say so, of those armies; and the\nmost destructive frenzy that ever befel the European nations, was a source\nof opulence to those republics.\nThe inhabitants of trading cities, by importing the improved manufactures\nand expensive luxuries of richer countries, afforded some food to the\nvanity of the great proprietors, who eagerly purchased them with great\nquantities of the rude produce of their own lands. The commerce of a great\npart of Europe in those times, accordingly, consisted chiefly in the\nexchange of their own rude, for the manufactured produce of more civilized\nnations. Thus the wool of England used to be exchanged for the wines of\nFrance, and the fine cloths of Flanders, in the same manner as the corn in\nPoland is at this day, exchanged for the wines and brandies of France, and\nfor the silks and velvets of France and Italy.\nA taste for the finer and more improved manufactures was, in this manner,\nintroduced by foreign commerce into countries where no such works were\ncarried on. But when this taste became so general as to occasion a\nconsiderable demand, the merchants, in order to save the expense of\ncarriage, naturally endeavoured to establish some manufactures of the same\nkind in their own country. Hence the origin of the first manufactures for\ndistant sale, that seem to have been established in the western provinces\nof Europe, after the fall of the Roman empire.\nNo large country, it must be observed, ever did or could subsist without\nsome sort of manufactures being carried on in it; and when it is said of\nany such country that it has no manufactures, it must always be understood\nof the finer and more improved, or of such as are fit for distant sale. In\nevery large country both the clothing and household furniture or the far\ngreater part of the people, are the produce of their own industry. This is\neven more universally the case in those poor countries which are commonly\nsaid to have no manufactures, than in those rich ones that are said to\nabound in them. In the latter you will generally find, both in the clothes\nand household furniture of the lowest rank of people, a much greater\nproportion of foreign productions than in the former.\nThose manufactures which are fit for distant sale, seem to have been\nintroduced into different countries in two different ways.\nSometimes they have been introduced in the manner above mentioned, by the\nviolent operation, if one may say so, of the stocks of particular\nmerchants and undertakers, who established them in imitation of some\nforeign manufactures of the same kind. Such manufactures, therefore, are\nthe offspring of foreign commerce; and such seem to have been the ancient\nmanufactures of silks, velvets, and brocades, which flourished in Lucca\nduring the thirteenth century. They were banished from thence by the\ntyranny of one of Machiavel\u2019s heroes, Castruccio Castracani. In 1310, nine\nhundred families were driven out of Lucca, of whom thirty-one retired to\nVenice, and offered to introduce there the silk manufacture. {See Sandi\nIstoria civile de Vinezia, part 2 vol. i, page 247 and 256.} Their offer\nwas accepted, many privileges were conferred upon them, and they began the\nmanufacture with three hundred workmen. Such, too, seem to have been the\nmanufactures of fine cloths that anciently flourished in Flanders, and\nwhich were introduced into England in the beginning of the reign of\nElizabeth, and such are the present silk manufactures of Lyons and\nSpitalfields. Manufactures introduced in this manner are generally\nemployed upon foreign materials, being imitations of foreign manufactures.\nWhen the Venetian manufacture was first established, the materials were\nall brought from Sicily and the Levant. The more ancient manufacture of\nLucca was likewise carried on with foreign materials. The cultivation of\nmulberry trees, and the breeding of silk-worms, seem not to have been\ncommon in the northern parts of Italy before the sixteenth century. Those\narts were not introduced into France till the reign of Charles IX. The\nmanufactures of Flanders were carried on chiefly with Spanish and English\nwool. Spanish wool was the material, not of the first woollen manufacture\nof England, but of the first that was fit for distant sale. More than one\nhalf the materials of the Lyons manufacture is at this day foreign silk;\nwhen it was first established, the whole, or very nearly the whole, was\nso. No part of the materials of the Spitalfields manufacture is ever\nlikely to be the produce of England. The seat of such manufactures, as\nthey are generally introduced by the scheme and project of a few\nindividuals, is sometimes established in a maritime city, and sometimes in\nan inland town, according as their interest, judgment, or caprice, happen\nto determine.\nAt other times, manufactures for distant sale grow up naturally, and as it\nwere of their own accord, by the gradual refinement of those household and\ncoarser manufactures which must at all times be carried on even in the\npoorest and rudest countries. Such manufactures are generally employed\nupon the materials which the country produces, and they seem frequently to\nhave been first refined and improved in such inland countries as were not,\nindeed, at a very great, but at a considerable distance from the\nsea-coast, and sometimes even from all water carriage. An inland country,\nnaturally fertile and easily cultivated, produces a great surplus of\nprovisions beyond what is necessary for maintaining the cultivators; and\non account of the expense of land carriage, and inconveniency of river\nnavigation, it may frequently be difficult to send this surplus abroad.\nAbundance, therefore, renders provisions cheap, and encourages a great\nnumber of workmen to settle in the neighbourhood, who find that their\nindustry can there procure them more of the necessaries and conveniencies\nof life than in other places. They work up the materials of manufacture\nwhich the land produces, and exchange their finished work, or, what is the\nsame thing, the price of it, for more materials and provisions. They give\na new value to the surplus part of the rude produce, by saving the expense\nof carrying it to the water-side, or to some distant market; and they\nfurnish the cultivators with something in exchange for it that is either\nuseful or agreeable to them, upon easier terms than they could have\nobtained it before. The cultivators get a better price for their surplus\nproduce, and can purchase cheaper other conveniencies which they have\noccasion for. They are thus both encouraged and enabled to increase this\nsurplus produce by a further improvement and better cultivation of the\nland; and as the fertility of the land had given birth to the manufacture,\nso the progress of the manufacture re-acts upon the land, and increases\nstill further its fertility. The manufacturers first supply the\nneighbourhood, and afterwards, as their work improves and refines, more\ndistant markets. For though neither the rude produce, nor even the coarse\nmanufacture, could, without the greatest difficulty, support the expense\nof a considerable land-carriage, the refined and improved manufacture\neasily may. In a small bulk it frequently contains the price of a great\nquantity of rude produce. A piece of fine cloth, for example which weighs\nonly eighty pounds, contains in it the price, not only of eighty pounds\nweight of wool, but sometimes of several thousand weight of corn, the\nmaintenance of the different working people, and of their immediate\nemployers. The corn which could with difficulty have been carried abroad\nin its own shape, is in this manner virtually exported in that of the\ncomplete manufacture, and may easily be sent to the remotest corners of\nthe world. In this manner have grown up naturally, and, as it were, of\ntheir own accord, the manufactures of Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield,\nBirmingham, and Wolverhampton. Such manufactures are the offspring of\nagriculture. In the modern history of Europe, their extension and\nimprovement have generally been posterior to those which were the\noffspring of foreign commerce. England was noted for the manufacture of\nfine cloths made of Spanish wool, more than a century before any of those\nwhich now flourish in the places above mentioned were fit for foreign\nsale. The extension and improvement of these last could not take place but\nin consequence of the extension and improvement of agriculture, the last\nand greatest effect of foreign commerce, and of the manufactures\nimmediately introduced by it, and which I shall now proceed to explain.\nCHAPTER IV.\nHOW THE COMMERCE OF TOWNS CONTRIBUTED\nTO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY.\nThe increase and riches of commercial and manufacturing towns contributed\nto the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they\nbelonged, in three different ways.\nFirst, by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the\ncountry, they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further\nimprovement. This benefit was not even confined to the countries in which\nthey were situated, but extended more or less to all those with which they\nhad any dealings. To all of them they afforded a market for some part\neither of their rude or manufactured produce, and, consequently, gave some\nencouragement to the industry and improvement of all. Their own country,\nhowever, on account of its neighbourhood, necessarily derived the greatest\nbenefit from this market. Its rude produce being charged with less\ncarriage, the traders could pay the growers a better price for it, and yet\nafford it as cheap to the consumers as that of more distant countries.\nSecondly, the wealth acquired by the inhabitants of cities was frequently\nemployed in purchasing such lands as were to be sold, of which a great\npart would frequently be uncultivated. Merchants are commonly ambitious of\nbecoming country gentlemen, and, when they do, they are generally the best\nof all improvers. A merchant is accustomed to employ his money chiefly in\nprofitable projects; whereas a mere country gentleman is accustomed to\nemploy it chiefly in expense. The one often sees his money go from him,\nand return to him again with a profit; the other, when once he parts with\nit, very seldom expects to see any more of it. Those different habits\nnaturally affect their temper and disposition in every sort of business.\nThe merchant is commonly a bold, a country gentleman a timid undertaker.\nThe one is not afraid to lay out at once a large capital upon the\nimprovement of his land, when he has a probable prospect of raising the\nvalue of it in proportion to the expense; the other, if he has any\ncapital, which is not always the case, seldom ventures to employ it in\nthis manner. If he improves at all, it is commonly not with a capital, but\nwith what he can save out or his annual revenue. Whoever has had the\nfortune to live in a mercantile town, situated in an unimproved country,\nmust have frequently observed how much more spirited the operations of\nmerchants were in this way, than those of mere country gentlemen. The\nhabits, besides, of order, economy, and attention, to which mercantile\nbusiness naturally forms a merchant, render him much fitter to execute,\nwith profit and success, any project of improvement.\nThirdly, and lastly, commerce and manufactures gradually introduced order\nand good government, and with them the liberty and security of\nindividuals, among the inhabitants of the country, who had before lived\nalmost in a continual state of war with their neighbours, and of servile\ndependency upon their superiors. This, though it has been the least\nobserved, is by far the most important of all their effects. Mr Hume is\nthe only writer who, so far as I know, has hitherto taken notice of it.\nIn a country which has neither foreign commerce nor any of the finer\nmanufactures, a great proprietor, having nothing for which he can exchange\nthe greater part of the produce of his lands which is over and above the\nmaintenance of the cultivators, consumes the whole in rustic hospitality\nat home. If this surplus produce is sufficient to maintain a hundred or a\nthousand men, he can make use of it in no other way than by maintaining a\nhundred or a thousand men. He is at all times, therefore, surrounded with\na multitude of retainers and dependants, who, having no equivalent to give\nin return for their maintenance, but being fed entirely by his bounty,\nmust obey him, for the same reason that soldiers must obey the prince who\npays them. Before the extension of commerce and manufactures in Europe,\nthe hospitality of the rich and the great, from the sovereign down to the\nsmallest baron, exceeded every thing which, in the present times, we can\neasily form a notion of Westminster-hall was the dining-room of William\nRufus, and might frequently, perhaps, not be too large for his company. It\nwas reckoned a piece of magnificence in Thomas Becket, that he strewed the\nfloor of his hall with clean hay or rushes in the season, in order that\nthe knights and squires, who could not get seats, might not spoil their\nfine clothes when they sat down on the floor to eat their dinner. The\ngreat Earl of Warwick is said to have entertained every day, at his\ndifferent manors, 30,000 people; and though the number here may have been\nexaggerated, it must, however, have been very great to admit of such\nexaggeration. A hospitality nearly of the same kind was exercised not many\nyears ago in many different parts of the Highlands of Scotland. It seems\nto be common in all nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little\nknown. I have seen, says Doctor Pocock, an Arabian chief dine in the\nstreets of a town where he had come to sell his cattle, and invite all\npassengers, even common beggars, to sit down with him and partake of his\nbanquet.\nThe occupiers of land were in every respect as dependent upon the great\nproprietor as his retainers. Even such of them as were not in a state of\nvillanage, were tenants at will, who paid a rent in no respect equivalent\nto the subsistence which the land afforded them. A crown, half a crown, a\nsheep, a lamb, was some years ago, in the Highlands of Scotland, a common\nrent for lands which maintained a family. In some places it is so at this\nday; nor will money at present purchase a greater quantity of commodities\nthere than in other places. In a country where the surplus produce of a\nlarge estate must be consumed upon the estate itself, it will frequently\nbe more convenient for the proprietor, that part of it be consumed at a\ndistance from his own house, provided they who consume it are as dependent\nupon him as either his retainers or his menial servants. He is thereby\nsaved from the embarrassment of either too large a company, or too large a\nfamily. A tenant at will, who possesses land sufficient to maintain his\nfamily for little more than a quit-rent, is as dependent upon the\nproprietor as any servant or retainer whatever, and must obey him with as\nlittle reserve. Such a proprietor, as he feeds his servants and retainers\nat his own house, so he feeds his tenants at their houses. The subsistence\nof both is derived from his bounty, and its continuance depends upon his\ngood pleasure.\nUpon the authority which the great proprietors necessarily had, in such a\nstate of things, over their tenants and retainers, was founded the power\nof the ancient barons. They necessarily became the judges in peace, and\nthe leaders in war, of all who dwelt upon their estates. They could\nmaintain order, and execute the law, within their respective demesnes,\nbecause each of them could there turn the whole force of all the\ninhabitants against the injustice of anyone. No other person had\nsufficient authority to do this. The king, in particular, had not. In\nthose ancient times, he was little more than the greatest proprietor in\nhis dominions, to whom, for the sake of common defence against their\ncommon enemies, the other great proprietors paid certain respects. To have\nenforced payment of a small debt within the lands of a great proprietor,\nwhere all the inhabitants were armed, and accustomed to stand by one\nanother, would have cost the king, had he attempted it by his own\nauthority, almost the same effort as to extinguish a civil war. He was,\ntherefore, obliged to abandon the administration of justice, through the\ngreater part of the country, to those who were capable of administering\nit; and, for the same reason, to leave the command of the country militia\nto those whom that militia would obey.\nIt is a mistake to imagine that those territorial jurisdictions took their\norigin from the feudal law. Not only the highest jurisdictions, both civil\nand criminal, but the power of levying troops, of coining money, and even\nthat of making bye-laws for the government of their own people, were all\nrights possessed allodially by the great proprietors of land, several\ncenturies before even the name of the feudal law was known in Europe. The\nauthority and jurisdiction of the Saxon lords in England appear to have\nbeen as great before the Conquest as that of any of the Norman lords after\nit. But the feudal law is not supposed to have become the common law of\nEngland till after the Conquest. That the most extensive authority and\njurisdictions were possessed by the great lords in France allodially, long\nbefore the feudal law was introduced into that country, is a matter of\nfact that admits of no doubt. That authority, and those jurisdictions, all\nnecessarily flowed from the state of property and manners just now\ndescribed. Without remounting to the remote antiquities of either the\nFrench or English monarchies, we may find, in much later times, many\nproofs that such effects must always flow from such causes. It is not\nthirty years ago since Mr Cameron of Lochiel, a gentleman of Lochaber in\nScotland, without any legal warrant whatever, not being what was then\ncalled a lord of regality, nor even a tenant in chief, but a vassal of the\nDuke of Argyll, and with out being so much as a justice of peace, used,\nnotwithstanding, to exercise the highest criminal jurisdictions over his\nown people. He is said to have done so with great equity, though without\nany of the formalities of justice; and it is not improbable that the state\nof that part of the country at that time made it necessary for him to\nassume this authority, in order to maintain the public peace. That\ngentleman, whose rent never exceeded \u00a3500 a-year, carried, in 1745, 800 of\nhis own people into the rebellion with him.\nThe introduction of the feudal law, so far from extending, may be regarded\nas an attempt to moderate, the authority of the great allodial lords. It\nestablished a regular subordination, accompanied with a long train of\nservices and duties, from the king down to the smallest proprietor. During\nthe minority of the proprietor, the rent, together with the management of\nhis lands, fell into the hands of his immediate superior; and,\nconsequently, those of all great proprietors into the hands of the king,\nwho was charged with the maintenance and education of the pupil, and who,\nfrom his authority as guardian, was supposed to have a right of disposing\nof him in marriage, provided it was in a manner not unsuitable to his\nrank. But though this institution necessarily tended to strengthen the\nauthority of the king, and to weaken that of the great proprietors, it\ncould not do either sufficiently for establishing order and good\ngovernment among the inhabitants of the country; because it could not\nalter sufficiently that state of property and manners from which the\ndisorders arose. The authority of government still continued to be, as\nbefore, too weak in the head, and too strong in the inferior members; and\nthe excessive strength of the inferior members was the cause of the\nweakness of the head. After the institution of feudal subordination, the\nking was as incapable of restraining the violence of the great lords as\nbefore. They still continued to make war according to their own\ndiscretion, almost continually upon one another, and very frequently upon\nthe king; and the open country still continued to be a scene of violence,\nrapine, and disorder.\nBut what all the violence of the feudal institutions could never have\neffected, the silent and insensible operation of foreign commerce and\nmanufactures gradually brought about. These gradually furnished the great\nproprietors with something for which they could exchange the whole surplus\nproduce of their lands, and which they could consume themselves, without\nsharing it either with tenants or retainers. All for ourselves, and\nnothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been\nthe vile maxim of the masters of mankind. As soon, therefore, as they\ncould find a method of consuming the whole value of their rents\nthemselves, they had no disposition to share them with any other persons.\nFor a pair of diamond buckles, perhaps, or for something as frivolous and\nuseless, they exchanged the maintenance, or, what is the same thing, the\nprice of the maintenance of 1000 men for a year, and with it the whole\nweight and authority which it could give them. The buckles, however, were\nto be all their own, and no other human creature was to have any share of\nthem; whereas, in the more ancient method of expense, they must have\nshared with at least 1000 people. With the judges that were to determine\nthe preference, this difference was perfectly decisive; and thus, for the\ngratification of the most childish, the meanest, and the most sordid of\nall vanities they gradually bartered their whole power and authority.\nIn a country where there is no foreign commerce, nor any of the finer\nmanufactures, a man of \u00a310,000 a-year cannot well employ his revenue in\nany other way than in maintaining, perhaps, 1000 families, who are all of\nthem necessarily at his command. In the present state of Europe, a man of\n\u00a310,000 a-year can spend his whole revenue, and he generally does so,\nwithout directly maintaining twenty people, or being able to command more\nthan ten footmen, not worth the commanding. Indirectly, perhaps, he\nmaintains as great, or even a greater number of people, than he could have\ndone by the ancient method of expense. For though the quantity of precious\nproductions for which he exchanges his whole revenue be very small, the\nnumber of workmen employed in collecting and preparing it must necessarily\nhave been very great. Its great price generally arises from the wages of\ntheir labour, and the profits of all their immediate employers. By paying\nthat price, he indirectly pays all those wages and profits, and thus\nindirectly contributes to the maintenance of all the workmen and their\nemployers. He generally contributes, however, but a very small proportion\nto that of each; to a very few, perhaps, not a tenth, to many not a\nhundredth, and to some not a thousandth, or even a ten thousandth part of\ntheir whole annual maintenance. Though he contributes, therefore, to the\nmaintenance of them all, they are all more or less independent of him,\nbecause generally they can all be maintained without him.\nWhen the great proprietors of land spend their rents in maintaining their\ntenants and retainers, each of them maintains entirely all his own tenants\nand all his own retainers. But when they spend them in maintaining\ntradesmen and artificers, they may, all of them taken together, perhaps\nmaintain as great, or, on account of the waste which attends rustic\nhospitality, a greater number of people than before. Each of them,\nhowever, taken singly, contributes often but a very small share to the\nmaintenance of any individual of this greater number. Each tradesman or\nartificer derives his subsistence from the employment, not of one, but of\na hundred or a thousand different customers. Though in some measure\nobliged to them all, therefore, he is not absolutely dependent upon any\none of them.\nThe personal expense of the great proprietors having in this manner\ngradually increased, it was impossible that the number of their retainers\nshould not as gradually diminish, till they were at last dismissed\naltogether. The same cause gradually led them to dismiss the unnecessary\npart of their tenants. Farms were enlarged, and the occupiers of land,\nnotwithstanding the complaints of depopulation, reduced to the number\nnecessary for cultivating it, according to the imperfect state of\ncultivation and improvement in those times. By the removal of the\nunnecessary mouths, and by exacting from the farmer the full value of the\nfarm, a greater surplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of a\ngreater surplus, was obtained for the proprietor, which the merchants and\nmanufacturers soon furnished him with a method of spending upon his own\nperson, in the same manner as he had done the rest. The cause continuing\nto operate, he was desirous to raise his rents above what his lands, in\nthe actual state of their improvement, could afford. His tenants could\nagree to this upon one condition only, that they should be secured in\ntheir possession for such a term of years as might give them time to\nrecover, with profit, whatever they should lay out in the further\nimprovement of the land. The expensive vanity of the landlord made him\nwilling to accept of this condition; and hence the origin of long leases.\nEven a tenant at will, who pays the full value of the land, is not\naltogether dependent upon the landlord. The pecuniary advantages which\nthey receive from one another are mutual and equal, and such a tenant will\nexpose neither his life nor his fortune in the service of the proprietor.\nBut if he has a lease for a long term of years he is altogether\nindependent; and his landlord must not expect from him even the most\ntrifling service, beyond what is either expressly stipulated in the lease,\nor imposed upon him by the common and known law of the country.\nThe tenants having in this manner become independent, and the retainers\nbeing dismissed, the great proprietors were no longer capable of\ninterrupting the regular execution of justice, or of disturbing the peace\nof the country. Having sold their birth-right, not like Esau, for a mess\nof pottage in time of hunger and necessity, but, in the wantonness of\nplenty, for trinkets and baubles, fitter to be the playthings of children\nthan the serious pursuits of men, they became as insignificant as any\nsubstantial burgher or tradesmen in a city. A regular government was\nestablished in the country as well as in the city, nobody having\nsufficient power to disturb its operations in the one, any more than in\nthe other.\nIt does not, perhaps, relate to the present subject, but I cannot help\nremarking it, that very old families, such as have possessed some\nconsiderable estate from father to son for many successive generations,\nare very rare in commercial countries. In countries which have little\ncommerce, on the contrary, such as Wales, or the Highlands of Scotland,\nthey are very common. The Arabian histories seem to be all full of\ngenealogies; and there is a history written by a Tartar Khan, which has\nbeen translated into several European languages, and which contains scarce\nany thing else; a proof that ancient families are very common among those\nnations. In countries where a rich man can spend his revenue in no other\nway than by maintaining as many people as it can maintain, he is apt to\nrun out, and his benevolence, it seems, is seldom so violent as to attempt\nto maintain more than he can afford. But where he can spend the greatest\nrevenue upon his own person, he frequently has no bounds to his expense,\nbecause he frequently has no bounds to his vanity, or to his affection for\nhis own person. In commercial countries, therefore, riches, in spite of\nthe most violent regulations of law to prevent their dissipation, very\nseldom remain long in the same family. Among simple nations, on the\ncontrary, they frequently do, without any regulations of law; for among\nnations of shepherds, such as the Tartars and Arabs, the consumable nature\nof their property necessarily renders all such regulations impossible.\nA revolution of the greatest importance to the public happiness, was in\nthis manner brought about by two different orders of people, who had not\nthe least intention to serve the public. To gratify the most childish\nvanity was the sole motive of the great proprietors. The merchants and\nartificers, much less ridiculous, acted merely from a view to their own\ninterest, and in pursuit of their own pedlar principle of turning a penny\nwherever a penny was to be got. Neither of them had either knowledge or\nforesight of that great revolution which the folly of the one, and the\nindustry of the other, was gradually bringing about.\nIt was thus, that, through the greater part of Europe, the commerce and\nmanufactures of cities, instead of being the effect, have been the cause\nand occasion of the improvement and cultivation of the country.\nThis order, however, being contrary to the natural course of things, is\nnecessarily both slow and uncertain. Compare the slow progress of those\nEuropean countries of which the wealth depends very much upon their\ncommerce and manufactures, with the rapid advances of our North American\ncolonies, of which the wealth is founded altogether in agriculture.\nThrough the greater part of Europe, the number of inhabitants is not\nsupposed to double in less than five hundred years. In several of our\nNorth American colonies, it is found to double in twenty or\nfive-and-twenty years. In Europe, the law of primogeniture, and\nperpetuities of different kinds, prevent the division of great estates,\nand thereby hinder the multiplication of small proprietors. A small\nproprietor, however, who knows every part of his little territory, views\nit with all the affection which property, especially small property,\nnaturally inspires, and who upon that account takes pleasure, not only in\ncultivating, but in adorning it, is generally of all improvers the most\nindustrious, the most intelligent, and the most successful. The same\nregulations, besides, keep so much land out of the market, that there are\nalways more capitals to buy than there is land to sell, so that what is\nsold always sells at a monopoly price. The rent never pays the interest of\nthe purchase-money, and is, besides, burdened with repairs and other\noccasional charges, to which the interest of money is not liable. To\npurchase land, is, everywhere in Europe, a most unprofitable employment of\na small capital. For the sake of the superior security, indeed, a man of\nmoderate circumstances, when he retires from business, will sometimes\nchoose to lay out his little capital in land. A man of profession, too\nwhose revenue is derived from another source often loves to secure his\nsavings in the same way. But a young man, who, instead of applying to\ntrade or to some profession, should employ a capital of two or three\nthousand pounds in the purchase and cultivation of a small piece of land,\nmight indeed expect to live very happily and very independently, but must\nbid adieu for ever to all hope of either great fortune or great\nillustration, which, by a different employment of his stock, he might have\nhad the same chance of acquiring with other people. Such a person, too,\nthough he cannot aspire at being a proprietor, will often disdain to be a\nfarmer. The small quantity of land, therefore, which is brought to market,\nand the high price of what is brought thither, prevents a great number of\ncapitals from being employed in its cultivation and improvement, which\nwould otherwise have taken that direction. In North America, on the\ncontrary, fifty or sixty pounds is often found a sufficient stock to begin\na plantation with. The purchase and improvement of uncultivated land is\nthere the most profitable employment of the smallest as well as of the\ngreatest capitals, and the most direct road to all the fortune and\nillustration which can be required in that country. Such land, indeed, is\nin North America to be had almost for nothing, or at a price much below\nthe value of the natural produce; a thing impossible in Europe, or indeed\nin any country where all lands have long been private property. If landed\nestates, however, were divided equally among all the children, upon the\ndeath of any proprietor who left a numerous family, the estate would\ngenerally be sold. So much land would come to market, that it could no\nlonger sell at a monopoly price. The free rent of the land would go no\nnearer to pay the interest of the purchase-money, and a small capital\nmight be employed in purchasing land as profitable as in any other way.\nEngland, on account of the natural fertility of the soil, of the great\nextent of the sea-coast in proportion to that of the whole country, and of\nthe many navigable rivers which run through it, and afford the conveniency\nof water carriage to some of the most inland parts of it, is perhaps as\nwell fitted by nature as any large country in Europe to be the seat of\nforeign commerce, of manufactures for distant sale, and of all the\nimprovements which these can occasion. From the beginning of the reign of\nElizabeth, too, the English legislature has been peculiarly attentive to\nthe interest of commerce and manufactures, and in reality there is no\ncountry in Europe, Holland itself not excepted, of which the law is, upon\nthe whole, more favourable to this sort of industry. Commerce and\nmanufactures have accordingly been continually advancing during all this\nperiod. The cultivation and improvement of the country has, no doubt, been\ngradually advancing too; but it seems to have followed slowly, and at a\ndistance, the more rapid progress of commerce and manufactures. The\ngreater part of the country must probably have been cultivated before the\nreign of Elizabeth; and a very great part of it still remains\nuncultivated, and the cultivation of the far greater part much inferior to\nwhat it might be, The law of England, however, favours agriculture, not\nonly indirectly, by the protection of commerce, but by several direct\nencouragements. Except in times of scarcity, the exportation of corn is\nnot only free, but encouraged by a bounty. In times of moderate plenty,\nthe importation of foreign corn is loaded with duties that amount to a\nprohibition. The importation of live cattle, except from Ireland, is\nprohibited at all times; and it is but of late that it was permitted from\nthence. Those who cultivate the land, therefore, have a monopoly against\ntheir countrymen for the two greatest and most important articles of land\nproduce, bread and butcher\u2019s meat. These encouragements, although at\nbottom, perhaps, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter, altogether\nillusory, sufficiently demonstrate at least the good intention of the\nlegislature to favour agriculture. But what is of much more importance\nthan all of them, the yeomanry of England are rendered as secure, as\nindependent, and as respectable, as law can make them. No country,\ntherefore, which the right of primogeniture takes place, which pays\ntithes, and where perpetuities, though contrary to the spirit of the law,\nare admitted in some cases, can give more encouragement to agriculture\nthan England. Such, however, notwithstanding, is the state of its\ncultivation. What would it have been, had the law given no direct\nencouragement to agriculture besides what arises indirectly from the\nprogress of commerce, and had left the yeomanry in the same condition as\nin most other countries of Europe? It is now more than two hundred years\nsince the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, a period as long as the\ncourse of human prosperity usually endures.\nFrance seems to have had a considerable share of foreign commerce, near a\ncentury before England was distinguished as a commercial country. The\nmarine of France was considerable, according to the notions of the times,\nbefore the expedition of Charles VIII. to Naples. The cultivation and\nimprovement of France, however, is, upon the whole, inferior to that of\nEngland. The law of the country has never given the same direct\nencouragement to agriculture.\nThe foreign commerce of Spain and Portugal to the other parts of Europe,\nthough chiefly carried on in foreign ships, is very considerable. That to\ntheir colonies is carried on in their own, and is much greater, on account\nof the great riches and extent of those colonies. But it has never\nintroduced any considerable manufactures for distant sale into either of\nthose countries, and the greater part of both still remains uncultivated.\nThe foreign commerce of Portugal is of older standing than that of any\ngreat country in Europe, except Italy.\nItaly is the only great country of Europe which seems to have been\ncultivated and improved in every part, by means of foreign commerce and\nmanufactures for distant sale. Before the invasion of Charles VIII.,\nItaly, according to Guicciardini, was cultivated not less in the most\nmountainous and barren parts of the country, than in the plainest and most\nfertile. The advantageous situation of the country, and the great number\nof independent states which at that time subsisted in it, probably\ncontributed not a little to this general cultivation. It is not\nimpossible, too, notwithstanding this general expression of one of the\nmost judicious and reserved of modern historians, that Italy was not at\nthat time better cultivated than England is at present.\nThe capital, however, that is acquired to any country by commerce and\nmanufactures, is always a very precarious and uncertain possession, till\nsome part of it has been secured and realized in the cultivation and\nimprovement of its lands. A merchant, it has been said very properly, is\nnot necessarily the citizen of any particular country. It is in a great\nmeasure indifferent to him from what place he carries on his trade; and a\nvery trifling disgust will make him remove his capital, and, together with\nit, all the industry which it supports, from one country to another. No\npart of it can be said to belong to any particular country, till it has\nbeen spread, as it were, over the face of that country, either in\nbuildings, or in the lasting improvement of lands. No vestige now remains\nof the great wealth said to have been possessed by the greater part of the\nHanse Towns, except in the obscure histories of the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries. It is even uncertain where some of them were\nsituated, or to what towns in Europe the Latin names given to some of them\nbelong. But though the misfortunes of Italy, in the end of the fifteenth\nand beginning of the sixteenth centuries, greatly diminished the commerce\nand manufactures of the cities of Lombardy and Tuscany, those countries\nstill continue to be among the most populous and best cultivated in\nEurope. The civil wars of Flanders, and the Spanish government which\nsucceeded them, chased away the great commerce of Antwerp, Ghent, and\nBruges. But Flanders still continues to be one of the richest, best\ncultivated, and most populous provinces of Europe. The ordinary\nrevolutions of war and government easily dry up the sources of that wealth\nwhich arises from commerce only. That which arises from the more solid\nimprovements of agriculture is much more durable, and cannot be destroyed\nbut by those more violent convulsions occasioned by the depredations of\nhostile and barbarous nations continued for a century or two together;\nsuch as those that happened for some time before and after the fall of the\nRoman empire in the western provinces of Europe.\nBOOK IV.\nOF SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.\nPolitical economy, considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or\nlegislator, proposes two distinct objects; first, to provide a plentiful\nrevenue or subsistence for the people, or, more properly, to enable them\nto provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves; and, secondly, to\nsupply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public\nservices. It proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign.\nThe different progress of opulence in different ages and nations, has\ngiven occasion to two different systems of political economy, with regard\nto enriching the people. The one may be called the system of commerce, the\nother that of agriculture. I shall endeavour to explain both as fully and\ndistinctly as I can, and shall begin with the system of commerce. It is\nthe modern system, and is best understood in our own country and in our\nown times.\nCHAPTER I.\nOF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMERCIAL OR\nMERCANTILE SYSTEM.\nThat wealth consists in money, or in gold and silver, is a popular notion\nwhich naturally arises from the double function of money, as the\ninstrument of commerce, and as the measure of value. In consequence of its\nbeing the instrument of commerce, when we have money we can more readily\nobtain whatever else we have occasion for, than by means of any other\ncommodity. The great affair, we always find, is to get money. When that is\nobtained, there is no difficulty in making any subsequent purchase. In\nconsequence of its being the measure of value, we estimate that of all\nother commodities by the quantity of money which they will exchange for.\nWe say of a rich man, that he is worth a great deal, and of a poor man,\nthat he is worth very little money. A frugal man, or a man eager to be\nrich, is said to love money; and a careless, a generous, or a profuse man,\nis said to be indifferent about it. To grow rich is to get money; and\nwealth and money, in short, are, in common language, considered as in\nevery respect synonymous.\nA rich country, in the same manner as a rich man, is supposed to be a\ncountry abounding in money; and to heap up gold and silver in any country\nis supposed to be the readiest way to enrich it. For some time after the\ndiscovery of America, the first inquiry of the Spaniards, when they\narrived upon any unknown coast, used to be, if there was any gold or\nsilver to be found in the neighbourhood? By the information which they\nreceived, they judged whether it was worth while to make a settlement\nthere, or if the country was worth the conquering. Plano Carpino, a monk\nsent ambassador from the king of France to one of the sons of the famous\nGengis Khan, says, that the Tartars used frequently to ask him, if there\nwas plenty of sheep and oxen in the kingdom of France? Their inquiry had\nthe same object with that of the Spaniards. They wanted to know if the\ncountry was rich enough to be worth the conquering. Among the Tartars, as\namong all other nations of shepherds, who are generally ignorant of the\nuse of money, cattle are the instruments of commerce and the measures of\nvalue. Wealth, therefore, according to them, consisted in cattle, as,\naccording to the Spaniards, it consisted in gold and silver. Of the two,\nthe Tartar notion, perhaps, was the nearest to the truth.\nMr Locke remarks a distinction between money and other moveable goods. All\nother moveable goods, he says, are of so consumable a nature, that the\nwealth which consists in them cannot be much depended on; and a nation\nwhich abounds in them one year may, without any exportation, but merely by\ntheir own waste and extravagance, be in great want of them the next.\nMoney, on the contrary, is a steady friend, which, though it may travel\nabout from hand to hand, yet if it can be kept from going out of the\ncountry, is not very liable to be wasted and consumed. Gold and silver,\ntherefore, are, according to him, the must solid and substantial part of\nthe moveable wealth of a nation; and to multiply those metals ought, he\nthinks, upon that account, to be the great object of its political\neconomy.\nOthers admit, that if a nation could be separated from all the world, it\nwould be of no consequence how much or how little money circulated in it.\nThe consumable goods, which were circulated by means of this money, would\nonly be exchanged for a greater or a smaller number of pieces; but the\nreal wealth or poverty of the country, they allow, would depend altogether\nupon the abundance or scarcity of those consumable goods. But it is\notherwise, they think, with countries which have connections with foreign\nnations, and which are obliged to carry on foreign wars, and to maintain\nfleets and armies in distant countries. This, they say, cannot be done,\nbut by sending abroad money to pay them with; and a nation cannot send\nmuch money abroad, unless it has a good deal at home. Every such nation,\ntherefore, must endeavour, in time of peace, to accumulate gold and\nsilver, that when occasion requires, it may have wherewithal to carry on\nforeign wars.\nIn consequence of those popular notions, all the different nations of\nEurope have studied, though to little purpose, every possible means of\naccumulating gold and silver in their respective countries. Spain and\nPortugal, the proprietors of the principal mines which supply Europe with\nthose metals, have either prohibited their exportation under the severest\npenalties, or subjected it to a considerable duty. The like prohibition\nseems anciently to have made a part of the policy of most other European\nnations. It is even to be found, where we should least of all expect to\nfind it, in some old Scotch acts of Parliament, which forbid, under heavy\npenalties, the carrying gold or silver forth of the kingdom. The like\npolicy anciently took place both in France and England.\nWhen those countries became commercial, the merchants found this\nprohibition, upon many occasions, extremely inconvenient. They could\nfrequently buy more advantageously with gold and silver, than with any\nother commodity, the foreign goods which they wanted, either to import\ninto their own, or to carry to some other foreign country. They\nremonstrated, therefore, against this prohibition as hurtful to trade.\nThey represented, first, that the exportation of gold and silver, in order\nto purchase foreign goods, did not always diminish the quantity of those\nmetals in the kingdom; that, on the contrary, it might frequently increase\nthe quantity; because, if the consumption of foreign goods was not thereby\nincreased in the country, those goods might be re-exported to foreign\ncountries, and being there sold for a large profit, might bring back much\nmore treasure than was originally sent out to purchase them. Mr Mun\ncompares this operation of foreign trade to the seed-time and harvest of\nagriculture. \u201cIf we only behold,\u201d says he, \u201cthe actions of the husbandman\nin the seed time, when he casteth away much good corn into the ground, we\nshall account him rather a madman than a husbandman. But when we consider\nhis labours in the harvest, which is the end of his endeavours, we shall\nfind the worth and plentiful increase of his actions.\u201d\nThey represented, secondly, that this prohibition could not hinder the\nexportation of gold and silver, which, on account of the smallness of\ntheir bulk in proportion to their value, could easily be smuggled abroad.\nThat this exportation could only be prevented by a proper attention to\nwhat they called the balance of trade. That when the country exported to a\ngreater value than it imported, a balance became due to it from foreign\nnations, which was necessarily paid to it in gold and silver, and thereby\nincreased the quantity of those metals in the kingdom. But that when it\nimported to a greater value than it exported, a contrary balance became\ndue to foreign nations, which was necessarily paid to them in the same\nmanner, and thereby diminished that quantity: that in this case, to\nprohibit the exportation of those metals, could not prevent it, but only,\nby making it more dangerous, render it more expensive: that the exchange\nwas thereby turned more against the country which owed the balance, than\nit otherwise might have been; the merchant who purchased a bill upon the\nforeign country being obliged to pay the banker who sold it, not only for\nthe natural risk, trouble, and expense of sending the money thither, but\nfor the extraordinary risk arising from the prohibition; but that the more\nthe exchange was against any country, the more the balance of trade became\nnecessarily against it; the money of that country becoming necessarily of\nso much less value, in comparison with that of the country to which the\nbalance was due. That if the exchange between England and Holland, for\nexample, was five per cent. against England, it would require 105 ounces\nof silver in England to purchase a bill for 100 ounces of silver in\nHolland: that 105 ounces of silver in England, therefore, would be worth\nonly 100 ounces of silver in Holland, and would purchase only a\nproportionable quantity of Dutch goods; but that 100 ounces of silver in\nHolland, on the contrary, would be worth 105 ounces in England, and would\npurchase a proportionable quantity of English goods; that the English\ngoods which were sold to Holland would be sold so much cheaper, and the\nDutch goods which were sold to England so much dearer, by the difference\nof the exchange: that the one would draw so much less Dutch money to\nEngland, and the other so much more English money to Holland, as this\ndifference amounted to: and that the balance of trade, therefore, would\nnecessarily be so much more against England, and would require a greater\nbalance of gold and silver to be exported to Holland.\nThose arguments were partly solid and partly sophistical. They were solid,\nso far as they asserted that the exportation of gold and silver in trade\nmight frequently be advantageous to the country. They were solid, too, in\nasserting that no prohibition could prevent their exportation, when\nprivate people found any advantage in exporting them. But they were\nsophistical, in supposing, that either to preserve or to augment the\nquantity of those metals required more the attention of government, than\nto preserve or to augment the quantity of any other useful commodities,\nwhich the freedom of trade, without any such attention, never fails to\nsupply in the proper quantity. They were sophistical, too, perhaps, in\nasserting that the high price of exchange necessarily increased what they\ncalled the unfavourable balance of trade, or occasioned the exportation of\na greater quantity of gold and silver. That high price, indeed, was\nextremely disadvantageous to the merchants who had any money to pay in\nforeign countries. They paid so much dearer for the bills which their\nbankers granted them upon those countries. But though the risk arising\nfrom the prohibition might occasion some extraordinary expense to the\nbankers, it would not necessarily carry any more money out of the country.\nThis expense would generally be all laid out in the country, in smuggling\nthe money out of it, and could seldom occasion the exportation of a single\nsixpence beyond the precise sum drawn for. The high price of exchange,\ntoo, would naturally dispose the merchants to endeavour to make their\nexports nearly balance their imports, in order that they might have this\nhigh exchange to pay upon as small a sum as possible. The high price of\nexchange, besides, must necessarily have operated as a tax, in raising the\nprice of foreign goods, and thereby diminishing their consumption. It\nwould tend, therefore, not to increase, but to diminish, what they called\nthe unfavourable balance of trade, and consequently the exportation of\ngold and silver.\nSuch as they were, however, those arguments convinced the people to whom\nthey were addressed. They were addressed by merchants to parliaments and\nto the councils of princes, to nobles, and to country gentlemen; by those\nwho were supposed to understand trade, to those who were conscious to them\nselves that they knew nothing about the matter. That foreign trade\nenriched the country, experience demonstrated to the nobles and country\ngentlemen, as well as to the merchants; but how, or in what manner, none\nof them well knew. The merchants knew perfectly in what manner it enriched\nthemselves, it was their business to know it. But to know in what manner\nit enriched the country, was no part of their business. The subject never\ncame into their consideration, but when they had occasion to apply to\ntheir country for some change in the laws relating to foreign trade. It\nthen became necessary to say something about the beneficial effects of\nforeign trade, and the manner in which those effects were obstructed by\nthe laws as they then stood. To the judges who were to decide the\nbusiness, it appeared a most satisfactory account of the matter, when they\nwere told that foreign trade brought money into the country, but that the\nlaws in question hindered it from bringing so much as it otherwise would\ndo. Those arguments, therefore, produced the wished-for effect. The\nprohibition of exporting gold and silver was, in France and England,\nconfined to the coin of those respective countries. The exportation of\nforeign coin and of bullion was made free. In Holland, and in some other\nplaces, this liberty was extended even to the coin of the country. The\nattention of government was turned away from guarding against the\nexportation of gold and silver, to watch over the balance of trade, as the\nonly cause which could occasion any augmentation or diminution of those\nmetals. From one fruitless care, it was turned away to another care much\nmore intricate, much more embarrassing, and just equally fruitless. The\ntitle of Mun\u2019s book, England\u2019s Treasure in Foreign Trade, became a\nfundamental maxim in the political economy, not of England only, but of\nall other commercial countries. The inland or home trade, the most\nimportant of all, the trade in which an equal capital affords the greatest\nrevenue, and creates the greatest employment to the people of the country,\nwas considered as subsidiary only to foreign trade. It neither brought\nmoney into the country, it was said, nor carried any out of it. The\ncountry, therefore, could never become either richer or poorer by means of\nit, except so far as its prosperity or decay might indirectly influence\nthe state of foreign trade.\nA country that has no mines of its own, must undoubtedly draw its gold and\nsilver from foreign countries, in the same manner as one that has no\nvineyards of its own must draw its wines. It does not seem necessary,\nhowever, that the attention of government should be more turned towards\nthe one than towards the other object. A country that has wherewithal to\nbuy wine, will always get the wine which it has occasion for; and a\ncountry that has wherewithal to buy gold and silver, will never be in want\nof those metals. They are to be bought for a certain price, like all other\ncommodities; and as they are the price of all other commodities, so all\nother commodities are the price of those metals. We trust, with perfect\nsecurity, that the freedom of trade, without any attention of government,\nwill always supply us with the wine which we have occasion for; and we may\ntrust, with equal security, that it will always supply us with all the\ngold and silver which we can afford to purchase or to employ, either in\ncirculating our commodities or in other uses.\nThe quantity of every commodity which human industry can either purchase\nor produce, naturally regulates itself in every country according to the\neffectual demand, or according to the demand of those who are willing to\npay the whole rent, labour, and profits, which must be paid in order to\nprepare and bring it to market. But no commodities regulate themselves\nmore easily or more exactly, according to this effectual demand, than gold\nand silver; because, on account of the small bulk and great value of those\nmetals, no commodities can be more easily transported from one place to\nanother; from the places where they are cheap, to those where they are\ndear; from the places where they exceed, to those where they fall short of\nthis effectual demand. If there were in England, for example, an effectual\ndemand for an additional quantity of gold, a packet-boat could bring from\nLisbon, or from wherever else it was to be had, fifty tons of gold, which\ncould be coined into more than five millions of guineas. But if there were\nan effectual demand for grain to the same value, to import it would\nrequire, at five guineas a-ton, a million of tons of shipping, or a\nthousand ships of a thousand tons each. The navy of England would not be\nsufficient.\nWhen the quantity of gold and silver imported into any country exceeds the\neffectual demand, no vigilance of government can prevent their\nexportation. All the sanguinary laws of Spain and Portugal are not able to\nkeep their gold and silver at home. The continual importations from Peru\nand Brazil exceed the effectual demand of those countries, and sink the\nprice of those metals there below that in the neighbouring countries. If,\non the contrary, in any particular country, their quantity fell short of\nthe effectual demand, so as to raise their price above that of the\nneighbouring countries, the government would have no occasion to take any\npains to import them. If it were even to take pains to prevent their\nimportation, it would not be able to effectuate it. Those metals, when the\nSpartans had got wherewithal to purchase them, broke through all the\nbarriers which the laws of Lycurgus opposed to their entrance into\nLacedaemon. All the sanguinary laws of the customs are not able to prevent\nthe importation of the teas of the Dutch and Gottenburg East India\ncompanies; because somewhat cheaper than those of the British company. A\npound of tea, however, is about a hundred times the bulk of one of the\nhighest prices, sixteen shillings, that is commonly paid for it in silver,\nand more than two thousand times the bulk of the same price in gold, and,\nconsequently, just so many times more difficult to smuggle.\nIt is partly owing to the easy transportation of gold and silver, from the\nplaces where they abound to those where they are wanted, that the price of\nthose metals does not fluctuate continually, like that of the greater part\nof other commodities, which are hindered by their bulk from shifting their\nsituation, when the market happens to be either over or under-stocked with\nthem. The price of those metals, indeed, is not altogether exempted from\nvariation; but the changes to which it is liable are generally slow,\ngradual, and uniform. In Europe, for example, it is supposed, without much\nfoundation, perhaps, that during the course of the present and preceding\ncentury, they have been constantly, but gradually, sinking in their value,\non account of the continual importations from the Spanish West Indies. But\nto make any sudden change in the price of gold and silver, so as to raise\nor lower at once, sensibly and remarkably, the money price of all other\ncommodities, requires such a revolution in commerce as that occasioned by\nthe discovery of America.\nIf, not withstanding all this, gold and silver should at any time fall\nshort in a country which has wherewithal to purchase them, there are more\nexpedients for supplying their place, than that of almost any other\ncommodity. If the materials of manufacture are wanted, industry must stop.\nIf provisions are wanted, the people must starve. But if money is wanted,\nbarter will supply its place, though with a good deal of inconveniency.\nBuying and selling upon credit, and the different dealers compensating\ntheir credits with one another, once a-month, or once a-year, will supply\nit with less inconveniency. A well-regulated paper-money will supply it\nnot only without any inconveniency, but, in some cases, with some\nadvantages. Upon every account, therefore, the attention of government\nnever was so unnecessarily employed, as when directed to watch over the\npreservation or increase of the quantity of money in any country.\nNo complaint, however, is more common than that of a scarcity of money.\nMoney, like wine, must always be scarce with those who have neither\nwherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it. Those who have either,\nwill seldom be in want either of the money, or of the wine which they have\noccasion for. This complaint, however, of the scarcity of money, is not\nalways confined to improvident spendthrifts. It is sometimes general\nthrough a whole mercantile town and the country in its neighbourhood.\nOver-trading is the common cause of it. Sober men, whose projects have\nbeen disproportioned to their capitals, are as likely to have neither\nwherewithal to buy money, nor credit to borrow it, as prodigals, whose\nexpense has been disproportioned to their revenue. Before their projects\ncan be brought to bear, their stock is gone, and their credit with it.\nThey run about everywhere to borrow money, and everybody tells them that\nthey have none to lend. Even such general complaints of the scarcity of\nmoney do not always prove that the usual number of gold and silver pieces\nare not circulating in the country, but that many people want those pieces\nwho have nothing to give for them. When the profits of trade happen to be\ngreater than ordinary over-trading becomes a general error, both among\ngreat and small dealers. They do not always send more money abroad than\nusual, but they buy upon credit, both at home and abroad, an unusual\nquantity of goods, which they send to some distant market, in hopes that\nthe returns will come in before the demand for payment. The demand comes\nbefore the returns, and they have nothing at hand with which they can\neither purchase money or give solid security for borrowing. It is not any\nscarcity of gold and silver, but the difficulty which such people find in\nborrowing, and which their creditor find in getting payment, that\noccasions the general complaint of the scarcity of money.\nIt would be too ridiculous to go about seriously to prove, that wealth\ndoes not consist in money, or in gold and silver; but in what money\npurchases, and is valuable only for purchasing. Money, no doubt, makes\nalways a part of the national capital; but it has already been shown that\nit generally makes but a small part, and always the most unprofitable part\nof it.\nIt is not because wealth consists more essentially in money than in goods,\nthat the merchant finds it generally more easy to buy goods with money,\nthan to buy money with goods; but because money is the known and\nestablished instrument of commerce, for which every thing is readily given\nin exchange, but which is not always with equal readiness to be got in\nexchange for every thing. The greater part of goods, besides, are more\nperishable than money, and he may frequently sustain a much greater loss\nby keeping them. When his goods are upon hand, too, he is more liable to\nsuch demands for money as he may not be able to answer, than when he has\ngot their price in his coffers. Over and above all this, his profit arises\nmore directly from selling than from buying; and he is, upon all these\naccounts, generally much more anxious to exchange his goods for money than\nhis money for goods. But though a particular merchant, with abundance of\ngoods in his warehouse, may sometimes be ruined by not being able to sell\nthem in time, a nation or country is not liable to the same accident, The\nwhole capital of a merchant frequently consists in perishable goods\ndestined for purchasing money. But it is but a very small part of the\nannual produce of the land and labour of a country, which can ever be\ndestined for purchasing gold and silver from their neighbours. The far\ngreater part is circulated and consumed among themselves; and even of the\nsurplus which is sent abroad, the greater part is generally destined for\nthe purchase of other foreign goods. Though gold and silver, therefore,\ncould not be had in exchange for the goods destined to purchase them, the\nnation would not be ruined. It might, indeed, suffer some loss and\ninconveniency, and be forced upon some of those expedients which are\nnecessary for supplying the place of money. The annual produce of its land\nand labour, however, would be the same, or very nearly the same as usual;\nbecause the same, or very nearly the same consumable capital would be\nemployed in maintaining it. And though goods do not always draw money so\nreadily as money draws goods, in the long-run they draw it more\nnecessarily than even it draws them. Goods can serve many other purposes\nbesides purchasing money, but money can serve no other purpose besides\npurchasing goods. Money, therefore, necessarily runs after goods, but\ngoods do not always or necessarily run after money. The man who buys, does\nnot always mean to sell again, but frequently to use or to consume;\nwhereas he who sells always means to buy again. The one may frequently\nhave done the whole, but the other can never have done more than the one\nhalf of his business. It is not for its own sake that men desire money,\nbut for the sake of what they can purchase with it.\nConsumable commodities, it is said, are soon destroyed; whereas gold and\nsilver are of a more durable nature, and were it not for this continual\nexportation, might be accumulated for ages together, to the incredible\naugmentation of the real wealth of the country. Nothing, therefore, it is\npretended, can be more disadvantageous to any country, than the trade\nwhich consists in the exchange of such lasting for such perishable\ncommodities. We do not, however, reckon that trade disadvantageous, which\nconsists in the exchange of the hardware of England for the wines of\nFrance, and yet hardware is a very durable commodity, and were it not for\nthis continual exportation, might too be accumulated for ages together, to\nthe incredible augmentation of the pots and pans of the country. But it\nreadily occurs, that the number of such utensils is in every country\nnecessarily limited by the use which there is for them; that it would be\nabsurd to have more pots and pans than were necessary for cooking the\nvictuals usually consumed there; and that, if the quantity of victuals\nwere to increase, the number of pots and pans would readily increase along\nwith it; a part of the increased quantity of victuals being employed in\npurchasing them, or in maintaining an additional number of workmen whose\nbusiness it was to make them. It should as readily occur, that the\nquantity of gold and silver is, in every country, limited by the use which\nthere is for those metals; that their use consists in circulating\ncommodities, as coin, and in affording a species of household furniture,\nas plate; that the quantity of coin in every country is regulated by the\nvalue of the commodities which are to be circulated by it; increase that\nvalue, and immediately a part of it will be sent abroad to purchase,\nwherever it is to be had, the additional quantity of coin requisite for\ncirculating them: that the quantity of plate is regulated by the number\nand wealth of those private families who choose to indulge themselves in\nthat sort of magnificence; increase the number and wealth of such\nfamilies, and a part of this increased wealth will most probably be\nemployed in purchasing, wherever it is to be found, an additional quantity\nof plate; that to attempt to increase the wealth of any country, either by\nintroducing or by detaining in it an unnecessary quantity of gold and\nsilver, is as absurd as it would be to attempt to increase the good cheer\nof private families, by obliging them to keep an unnecessary number of\nkitchen utensils. As the expense of purchasing those unnecessary utensils\nwould diminish, instead of increasing, either the quantity or goodness of\nthe family provisions; so the expense of purchasing an unnecessary\nquantity of gold and silver must, in every country, as necessarily\ndiminish the wealth which feeds, clothes, and lodges, which maintains and\nemploys the people. Gold and silver, whether in the shape of coin or of\nplate, are utensils, it must be remembered, as much as the furniture of\nthe kitchen. Increase the use of them, increase the consumable commodities\nwhich are to be circulated, managed, and prepared by means of them, and\nyou will infallibly increase the quantity; but if you attempt by\nextraordinary means to increase the quantity, you will as infallibly\ndiminish the use, and even the quantity too, which in those metals can\nnever be greater than what the use requires. Were they ever to be\naccumulated beyond this quantity, their transportation is so easy, and the\nloss which attends their lying idle and unemployed so great, that no law\ncould prevent their being immediately sent out of the country.\nIt is not always necessary to accumulate gold and silver, in order to\nenable a country to carry on foreign wars, and to maintain fleets and\narmies in distant countries. Fleets and armies are maintained, not with\ngold and silver, but with consumable goods. The nation which, from the\nannual produce of its domestic industry, from the annual revenue arising\nout of its lands, and labour, and consumable stock, has wherewithal to\npurchase those consumable goods in distant countries, can maintain foreign\nwars there.\nA nation may purchase the pay and provisions of an army in a distant\ncountry three different ways; by sending abroad either, first, some part\nof its accumulated gold and silver; or, secondly, some part of the annual\nproduce of its manufactures; or, last of all, some part of its annual rude\nproduce.\nThe gold and silver which can properly be considered as accumulated, or\nstored up in any country, may be distinguished into three parts; first,\nthe circulating money; secondly, the plate of private families; and, last\nof all, the money which may have been collected by many years parsimony,\nand laid up in the treasury of the prince.\nIt can seldom happen that much can be spared from the circulating money of\nthe country; because in that there can seldom be much redundancy. The\nvalue of goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain\nquantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper\nconsumers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of circulation\nnecessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and never admits\nany more. Something, however, is generally withdrawn from this channel in\nthe case of foreign war. By the great number of people who are maintained\nabroad, fewer are maintained at home. Fewer goods are circulated there,\nand less money becomes necessary to circulate them. An extraordinary\nquantity of paper money of some sort or other, too, such as exchequer\nnotes, navy bills, and bank bills, in England, is generally issued upon\nsuch occasions, and, by supplying the place of circulating gold and\nsilver, gives an opportunity of sending a greater quantity of it abroad.\nAll this, however, could afford but a poor resource for maintaining a\nforeign war, of great expense, and several years duration.\nThe melting down of the plate of private families has, upon every\noccasion, been found a still more insignificant one. The French, in the\nbeginning of the last war, did not derive so much advantage from this\nexpedient as to compensate the loss of the fashion.\nThe accumulated treasures of the prince have in former times afforded a\nmuch greater and more lasting resource. In the present times, if you\nexcept the king of Prussia, to accumulate treasure seems to be no part of\nthe policy of European princes.\nThe funds which maintained the foreign wars of the present century, the\nmost expensive perhaps which history records, seem to have had little\ndependency upon the exportation either of the circulating money, or of the\nplate of private families, or of the treasure of the prince. The last\nFrench war cost Great Britain upwards of \u00a390,000,000, including not only\nthe \u00a375,000,000 of new debt that was contracted, but the additional 2s. in\nthe pound land-tax, and what was annually borrowed of the sinking fund.\nMore than two-thirds of this expense were laid out in distant countries;\nin Germany, Portugal, America, in the ports of the Mediterranean, in the\nEast and West Indies. The kings of England had no accumulated treasure. We\nnever heard of any extraordinary quantity of plate being melted down. The\ncirculating gold and silver of the country had not been supposed to exceed\n\u00a318,000,000. Since the late recoinage of the gold, however, it is believed\nto have been a good deal under-rated. Let us suppose, therefore, according\nto the most exaggerated computation which I remember to have either seen\nor heard of, that, gold and silver together, it amounted to \u00a330,000,000.\nHad the war been carried on by means of our money, the whole of it must,\neven according to this computation, have been sent out and returned again,\nat least twice in a period of between six and seven years. Should this be\nsupposed, it would afford the most decisive argument, to demonstrate how\nunnecessary it is for government to watch over the preservation of money,\nsince, upon this supposition, the whole money of the country must have\ngone from it, and returned to it again, two different times in so short a\nperiod, without any body\u2019s knowing any thing of the matter. The channel of\ncirculation, however, never appeared more empty than usual during any part\nof this period. Few people wanted money who had wherewithal to pay for it.\nThe profits of foreign trade, indeed, were greater than usual during the\nwhole war, but especially towards the end of it. This occasioned, what it\nalways occasions, a general over-trading in all the ports of Great\nBritain; and this again occasioned the usual complaint of the scarcity of\nmoney, which always follows over-trading. Many people wanted it, who had\nneither wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it; and because the\ndebtors found it difficult to borrow, the creditors found it difficult to\nget payment. Gold and silver, however, were generally to be had for their\nvalue, by those who had that value to give for them.\nThe enormous expense of the late war, therefore, must have been chiefly\ndefrayed, not by the exportation of gold and silver, but by that of\nBritish commodities of some kind or other. When the government, or those\nwho acted under them, contracted with a merchant for a remittance to some\nforeign country, he would naturally endeavour to pay his foreign\ncorrespondent, upon whom he granted a bill, by sending abroad rather\ncommodities than gold and silver. If the commodities of Great Britain were\nnot in demand in that country, he would endeavour to send them to some\nother country in which he could purchase a bill upon that country. The\ntransportation of commodities, when properly suited to the market, is\nalways attended with a considerable profit; whereas that of gold and\nsilver is scarce ever attended with any. When those metals are sent abroad\nin order to purchase foreign commodities, the merchant\u2019s profit arises,\nnot from the purchase, but from the sale of the returns. But when they are\nsent abroad merely to pay a debt, he gets no returns, and consequently no\nprofit. He naturally, therefore, exerts his invention to find out a way of\npaying his foreign debts, rather by the exportation of commodities, than\nby that of gold and silver. The great quantity of British goods, exported\nduring the course of the late war, without bringing back any returns, is\naccordingly remarked by the author of the Present State of the Nation.\nBesides the three sorts of gold and silver above mentioned, there is in\nall great commercial countries a good deal of bullion alternately imported\nand exported, for the purposes of foreign trade. This bullion, as it\ncirculates among different commercial countries, in the same manner as the\nnational coin circulates in every country, may be considered as the money\nof the great mercantile republic. The national coin receives its movement\nand direction from the commodities circulated within the precincts of each\nparticular country; the money in the mercantile republic, from those\ncirculated between different countries. Both are employed in facilitating\nexchanges, the one between different individuals of the same, the other\nbetween those of different nations. Part of this money of the great\nmercantile republic may have been, and probably was, employed in carrying\non the late war. In time of a general war, it is natural to suppose that a\nmovement and direction should be impressed upon it, different from what it\nusually follows in profound peace, that it should circulate more about the\nseat of the war, and be more employed in purchasing there, and in the\nneighbouring countries, the pay and provisions of the different armies.\nBut whatever part of this money of the mercantile republic Great Britain\nmay have annually employed in this manner, it must have been annually\npurchased, either with British commodities, or with something else that\nhad been purchased with them; which still brings us back to commodities,\nto the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, as the\nultimate resources which enabled us to carry on the war. It is natural,\nindeed, to suppose, that so great an annual expense must have been\ndefrayed from a great annual produce. The expense of 1761, for example,\namounted to more than \u00a319,000,000. No accumulation could have supported so\ngreat an annual profusion. There is no annual produce, even of gold and\nsilver, which could have supported it. The whole gold and silver annually\nimported into both Spain and Portugal, according to the best accounts,\ndoes not commonly much exceed \u00a36,000,000 sterling, which, in some years,\nwould scarce have paid four months expense of the late war.\nThe commodities most proper for being transported to distant countries, in\norder to purchase there either the pay and provisions of an army, or some\npart of the money of the mercantile republic to be employed in purchasing\nthem, seem to be the finer and more improved manufactures; such as contain\na great value in a small bulk, and can therefore be exported to a great\ndistance at little expense. A country whose industry produces a great\nannual surplus of such manufactures, which are usually exported to foreign\ncountries, may carry on for many years a very expensive foreign war,\nwithout either exporting any considerable quantity of gold and silver, or\neven having any such quantity to export. A considerable part of the annual\nsurplus of its manufactures must, indeed, in this case, be exported\nwithout bringing back any returns to the country, though it does to the\nmerchant; the government purchasing of the merchant his bills upon foreign\ncountries, in order to purchase there the pay and provisions of an army.\nSome part of this surplus, however, may still continue to bring back a\nreturn. The manufacturers during; the war will have a double demand upon\nthem, and be called upon first to work up goods to be sent abroad, for\npaying the bills drawn upon foreign countries for the pay and provisions\nof the army: and, secondly, to work up such as are necessary for\npurchasing the common returns that had usually been consumed in the\ncountry. In the midst of the most destructive foreign war, therefore, the\ngreater part of manufactures may frequently flourish greatly; and, on the\ncontrary, they may decline on the return of peace. They may flourish\namidst the ruin of their country, and begin to decay upon the return of\nits prosperity. The different state of many different branches of the\nBritish manufactures during the late war, and for some time after the\npeace, may serve as an illustration of what has been just now said.\nNo foreign war, of great expense or duration, could conveniently be\ncarried on by the exportation of the rude produce of the soil. The expense\nof sending such a quantity of it into a foreign country as might purchase\nthe pay and provisions of an army would be too great. Few countries, too,\nproduce much more rude produce than what is sufficient for the subsistence\nof their own inhabitants. To send abroad any great quantity of it,\ntherefore, would be to send abroad a part of the necessary subsistence of\nthe people. It is otherwise with the exportation of manufactures. The\nmaintenance of the people employed in them is kept at home, and only the\nsurplus part of their work is exported. Mr Hume frequently takes notice of\nthe inability of the ancient kings of England to carry on, without\ninterruption, any foreign war of long duration. The English in those days\nhad nothing wherewithal to purchase the pay and provisions of their armies\nin foreign countries, but either the rude produce of the soil, of which no\nconsiderable part could be spared from the home consumption, or a few\nmanufactures of the coarsest kind, of which, as well as of the rude\nproduce, the transportation was too expensive. This inability did not\narise from the want of money, but of the finer and more improved\nmanufactures. Buying and selling was transacted by means of money in\nEngland then as well as now. The quantity of circulating money must have\nborne the same proportion, to the number and value of purchases and sales\nusually transacted at that time, which it does to those transacted at\npresent; or, rather, it must have borne a greater proportion, because\nthere was then no paper, which now occupies a great part of the employment\nof gold and silver. Among nations to whom commerce and manufactures are\nlittle known, the sovereign, upon extraordinary occasions, can seldom draw\nany considerable aid from his subjects, for reasons which shall be\nexplained hereafter. It is in such countries, therefore, that he generally\nendeavours to accumulate a treasure, as the only resource against such\nemergencies. Independent of this necessity, he is, in such a situation,\nnaturally disposed to the parsimony requisite for accumulation. In that\nsimple state, the expense even of a sovereign is not directed by the\nvanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court, but is employed in\nbounty to his tenants, and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and\nhospitality very seldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almost always\ndoes. Every Tartar chief, accordingly, has a treasure. The treasures of\nMazepa, chief of the Cossacks in the Ukraine, the famous ally of Charles\nXII., are said to have been very great. The French kings of the\nMerovingian race had all treasures. When they divided their kingdom among\ntheir different children, they divided their treasures too. The Saxon\nprinces, and the first kings after the Conquest, seem likewise to have\naccumulated treasures. The first exploit of every new reign was commonly\nto seize the treasure of the preceding king, as the most essential measure\nfor securing the succession. The sovereigns of improved and commercial\ncountries are not under the same necessity of accumulating treasures,\nbecause they can generally draw from their subjects extraordinary aids\nupon extraordinary occasions. They are likewise less disposed to do so.\nThey naturally, perhaps necessarily, follow the mode of the times; and\ntheir expense comes to be regulated by the same extravagant vanity which\ndirects that of all the other great proprietors in their dominions. The\ninsignificant pageantry of their court becomes every day more brilliant;\nand the expense of it not only prevents accumulation, but frequently\nencroaches upon the funds destined for more necessary expenses. What\nDercyllidas said of the court of Persia, may be applied to that of several\nEuropean princes, that he saw there much splendour, but little strength,\nand many servants, but few soldiers.\nThe importation of gold and silver is not the principal, much less the\nsole benefit, which a nation derives from its foreign trade. Between\nwhatever places foreign trade is carried on, they all of them derive two\ndistinct benefits from it. It carries out that surplus part of the produce\nof their land and labour for which there is no demand among them, and\nbrings back in return for it something else for which there is a demand.\nIt gives a value to their superfluities, by exchanging them for something\nelse, which may satisfy a part of their wants and increase their\nenjoyments. By means of it, the narrowness of the home market does not\nhinder the division of labour in any particular branch of art or\nmanufacture from being carried to the highest perfection. By opening a\nmore extensive market for whatever part of the produce of their labour may\nexceed the home consumption, it encourages them to improve its productive\npower, and to augment its annual produce to the utmost, and thereby to\nincrease the real revenue and wealth of the society. These great and\nimportant services foreign trade is continually occupied in performing to\nall the different countries between which it is carried on. They all\nderive great benefit from it, though that in which the merchant resides\ngenerally derives the greatest, as he is generally more employed in\nsupplying the wants, and carrying out the superfluities of his own, than\nof any other particular country. To import the gold and silver which may\nbe wanted into the countries which have no mines, is, no doubt a part of\nthe business of foreign commerce. It is, however, a most insignificant\npart of it. A country which carried on foreign trade merely upon this\naccount, could scarce have occasion to freight a ship in a century.\nIt is not by the importation of gold and silver that the discovery of\nAmerica has enriched Europe. By the abundance of the American mines, those\nmetals have become cheaper. A service of plate can now be purchased for\nabout a third part of the corn, or a third part of the labour, which it\nwould have cost in the fifteenth century. With the same annual expense of\nlabour and commodities, Europe can annually purchase about three times the\nquantity of plate which it could have purchased at that time. But when a\ncommodity comes to be sold for a third part of what bad been its usual\nprice, not only those who purchased it before can purchase three times\ntheir former quantity, but it is brought down to the level of a much\ngreater number of purchasers, perhaps to more than ten, perhaps to more\nthan twenty times the former number. So that there may be in Europe at\npresent, not only more than three times, but more than twenty or thirty\ntimes the quantity of plate which would have been in it, even in its\npresent state of improvement, had the discovery of the American mines\nnever been made. So far Europe has, no doubt, gained a real conveniency,\nthough surely a very trifling one. The cheapness of gold and silver\nrenders those metals rather less fit for the purposes of money than they\nwere before. In order to make the same purchases, we must load ourselves\nwith a greater quantity of them, and carry about a shilling in our pocket,\nwhere a groat would have done before. It is difficult to say which is most\ntrifling, this inconveniency, or the opposite conveniency. Neither the one\nnor the other could have made any very essential change in the state of\nEurope. The discovery of America, however, certainly made a most essential\none. By opening a new and inexhaustible market to all the commodities of\nEurope, it gave occasion to new divisions of labour and improvements of\nart, which in the narrow circle of the ancient commerce could never have\ntaken place, for want of a market to take off the greater part of their\nproduce. The productive powers of labour were improved, and its produce\nincreased in all the different countries of Europe, and together with it\nthe real revenue and wealth of the inhabitants. The commodities of Europe\nwere almost all new to America, and many of those of America were new to\nEurope. A new set of exchanges, therefore, began to take place, which had\nnever been thought of before, and which should naturally have proved as\nadvantageous to the new, as it certainly did to the old continent. The\nsavage injustice of the Europeans rendered an event, which ought to have\nbeen beneficial to all, ruinous and destructive to several of those\nunfortunate countries.\nThe discovery of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope,\nwhich happened much about the same time, opened perhaps a still more\nextensive range to foreign commerce, than even that of America,\nnotwithstanding the greater distance. There were but two nations in\nAmerica, in any respect, superior to the savages, and these were destroyed\nalmost as soon as discovered. The rest were mere savages. But the empires\nof China, Indostan, Japan, as well as several others in the East Indies,\nwithout having richer mines of gold or silver, were, in every other\nrespect, much richer, better cultivated, and more advanced in all arts and\nmanufactures, than either Mexico or Peru, even though we should credit,\nwhat plainly deserves no credit, the exaggerated accounts of the Spanish\nwriters concerning the ancient state of those empires. But rich and\ncivilized nations can always exchange to a much greater value with one\nanother, than with savages and barbarians. Europe, however, has hitherto\nderived much less advantage from its commerce with the East Indies, than\nfrom that with America. The Portuguese monopolised the East India trade to\nthemselves for about a century; and it was only indirectly, and through\nthem, that the other nations of Europe could either send out or receive\nany goods from that country. When the Dutch, in the beginning of the last\ncentury, began to encroach upon them, they vested their whole East India\ncommerce in an exclusive company. The English, French, Swedes, and Danes,\nhave all followed their example; so that no great nation of Europe has\never yet had the benefit of a free commerce to the East Indies. No other\nreason need be assigned why it has never been so advantageous as the trade\nto America, which, between almost every nation of Europe and its own\ncolonies, is free to all its subjects. The exclusive privileges of those\nEast India companies, their great riches, the great favour and protection\nwhich these have procured them from their respective governments, have\nexcited much envy against them. This envy has frequently represented their\ntrade as altogether pernicious, on account of the great quantities of\nsilver which it every year exports from the countries from which it is\ncarried on. The parties concerned have replied, that their trade by this\ncontinual exportation of silver, might indeed tend to impoverish Europe in\ngeneral, but not the particular country from which it was carried on;\nbecause, by the exportation of a part of the returns to other European\ncountries, it annually brought home a much greater quantity of that metal\nthan it carried out. Both the objection and the reply are founded in the\npopular notion which I have been just now examining. It is therefore\nunnecessary to say any thing further about either. By the annual\nexportation of silver to the East Indies, plate is probably somewhat\ndearer in Europe than it otherwise might have been; and coined silver\nprobably purchases a larger quantity both of labour and commodities. The\nformer of these two effects is a very small loss, the latter a very small\nadvantage; both too insignificant to deserve any part of the public\nattention. The trade to the East Indies, by opening a market to the\ncommodities of Europe, or, what comes nearly to the same thing, to the\ngold and silver which is purchased with those commodities, must\nnecessarily tend to increase the annual production of European\ncommodities, and consequently the real wealth and revenue of Europe. That\nit has hitherto increased them so little, is probably owing to the\nrestraints which it everywhere labours under.\nI thought it necessary, though at the hazard of being tedious, to examine\nat full length this popular notion, that wealth consists in money or in\ngold and silver. Money, in common language, as I have already observed,\nfrequently signifies wealth; and this ambiguity of expression has rendered\nthis popular notion so familiar to us, that even they who are convinced of\nits absurdity, are very apt to forget their own principles, and, in the\ncourse of their reasonings, to take it for granted as a certain and\nundeniable truth. Some of the best English writers upon commerce set out\nwith observing, that the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and\nsilver only, but in its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all\ndifferent kinds. In the course of their reasonings, however, the lands,\nhouses, and consumable goods, seem to slip out of their memory; and the\nstrain of their argument frequently supposes that all wealth consists in\ngold and silver, and that to multiply those metals is the great object of\nnational industry and commerce.\nThe two principles being established, however, that wealth consisted in\ngold and silver, and that those metals could be brought into a country\nwhich had no mines, only by the balance of trade, or by exporting to a\ngreater value than it imported; it necessarily became the great object of\npolitical economy to diminish as much as possible the importation of\nforeign goods for home consumption, and to increase as much as possible\nthe exportation of the produce of domestic industry. Its two great engines\nfor enriching the country, therefore, were restraints upon importation,\nand encouragement to exportation.\nThe restraints upon importation were of two kinds.\nFirst, restraints upon the importation of such foreign goods for home\nconsumption as could be produced at home, from whatever country they were\nimported.\nSecondly, restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds,\nfrom those particular countries with which the balance of trade was\nsupposed to be disadvantageous.\nThose different restraints consisted sometimes in high duties, and\nsometimes in absolute prohibitions.\nExportation was encouraged sometimes by drawbacks, sometimes by bounties,\nsometimes by advantageous treaties of commerce with foreign states, and\nsometimes by the establishment of colonies in distant countries.\nDrawbacks were given upon two different occasions. When the home\nmanufactures were subject to any duty or excise, either the whole or a\npart of it was frequently drawn back upon their exportation; and when\nforeign goods liable to a duty were imported, in order to be exported\nagain, either the whole or a part of this duty was sometimes given back\nupon such exportation.\nBounties were given for the encouragement, either of some beginning\nmanufactures, or of such sorts of industry of other kinds as were supposed\nto deserve particular favour.\nBy advantageous treaties of commerce, particular privileges were procured\nin some foreign state for the goods and merchants of the country, beyond\nwhat were granted to those of other countries.\nBy the establishment of colonies in distant countries, not only particular\nprivileges, but a monopoly was frequently procured for the goods and\nmerchants of the country which established them.\nThe two sorts of restraints upon importation above mentioned, together\nwith these four encouragements to exportation, constitute the six\nprincipal means by which the commercial system proposes to increase the\nquantity of gold and silver in any country, by turning the balance of\ntrade in its favour. I shall consider each of them in a particular\nchapter, and, without taking much farther notice of their supposed\ntendency to bring money into the country, I shall examine chiefly what are\nlikely to be the effects of each of them upon the annual produce of its\nindustry. According as they tend either to increase or diminish the value\nof this annual produce, they must evidently tend either to increase or\ndiminish the real wealth and revenue of the country.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF RESTRAINTS UPON IMPORTATION FROM\nFOREIGN COUNTRIES OF SUCH GOODS AS CAN BE PRODUCED AT HOME.\nBy restraining, either by high duties, or by absolute prohibitions, the\nimportation of such goods from foreign countries as can be produced at\nhome, the monopoly of the home market is more or less secured to the\ndomestic industry employed in producing them. Thus the prohibition of\nimporting either live cattle or salt provisions from foreign countries,\nsecures to the graziers of Great Britain the monopoly of the home market\nfor butcher\u2019s meat. The high duties upon the importation of corn, which,\nin times of moderate plenty, amount to a prohibition, give a like\nadvantage to the growers of that commodity. The prohibition of the\nimportation of foreign woollen is equally favourable to the woollen\nmanufacturers. The silk manufacture, though altogether employed upon\nforeign materials, has lately obtained the same advantage. The linen\nmanufacture has not yet obtained it, but is making great strides towards\nit. Many other sorts of manufactures have, in the same manner obtained in\nGreat Britain, either altogether, or very nearly, a monopoly against their\ncountrymen. The variety of goods, of which the importation into Great\nBritain is prohibited, either absolutely, or under certain circumstances,\ngreatly exceeds what can easily be suspected by those who are not well\nacquainted with the laws of the customs.\nThat this monopoly of the home market frequently gives great encouragement\nto that particular species of industry which enjoys it, and frequently\nturns towards that employment a greater share of both the labour and stock\nof the society than would otherwise have gone to it, cannot be doubted.\nBut whether it tends either to increase the general industry of the\nsociety, or to give it the most advantageous direction, is not, perhaps,\naltogether so evident.\nThe general industry of the society can never exceed what the capital of\nthe society can employ. As the number of workmen that can be kept in\nemployment by any particular person must bear a certain proportion to his\ncapital, so the number of those that can be continually employed by all\nthe members of a great society must bear a certain proportion to the whole\ncapital of the society, and never can exceed that proportion. No\nregulation of commerce can increase the quantity of industry in any\nsociety beyond what its capital can maintain. It can only divert a part of\nit into a direction into which it might not otherwise have gone; and it is\nby no means certain that this artificial direction is likely to be more\nadvantageous to the society, than that into which it would have gone of\nits own accord.\nEvery individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most\nadvantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own\nadvantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in view. But\nthe study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily, leads him\nto prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society.\nFirst, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as\nhe can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic\nindustry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not\na great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock.\nThus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant\nnaturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and\nthe foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade,\nhis capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the\nforeign trade of consumption. He can know better the character and\nsituation of the persons whom he trusts; and if he should happen to be\ndeceived, he knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek\nredress. In the carrying trade, the capital of the merchant is, as it\nwere, divided between two foreign countries, and no part of it is ever\nnecessarily brought home, or placed under his own immediate view and\ncommand. The capital which an Amsterdam merchant employs in carrying corn\nfrom Koningsberg to Lisbon, and fruit and wine from Lisbon to Koningsberg,\nmust generally be the one half of it at Koningsberg, and the other half at\nLisbon. No part of it need ever come to Amsterdam. The natural residence\nof such a merchant should either be at Koningsberg or Lisbon; and it can\nonly be some very particular circumstances which can make him prefer the\nresidence of Amsterdam. The uneasiness, however, which he feels at being\nseparated so far from his capital, generally determines him to bring part\nboth of the Koningsberg goods which he destines for the market of Lisbon,\nand of the Lisbon goods which he destines for that of Koningsberg, to\nAmsterdam; and though this necessarily subjects him to a double charge of\nloading and unloading as well as to the payment of some duties and\ncustoms, yet, for the sake of having some part of his capital always under\nhis own view and command, he willingly submits to this extraordinary\ncharge; and it is in this manner that every country which has any\nconsiderable share of the carrying trade, becomes always the emporium, or\ngeneral market, for the goods of all the different countries whose trade\nit carries on. The merchant, in order to save a second loading and\nunloading, endeavours always to sell in the home market, as much of the\ngoods of all those different countries as he can; and thus, so far as he\ncan, to convert his carrying trade into a foreign trade of consumption. A\nmerchant, in the same manner, who is engaged in the foreign trade of\nconsumption, when he collects goods for foreign markets, will always be\nglad, upon equal or nearly equal profits, to sell as great a part of them\nat home as he can. He saves himself the risk and trouble of exportation,\nwhen, so far as he can, he thus converts his foreign trade of consumption\ninto a home trade. Home is in this manner the centre, if I may say so,\nround which the capitals of the inhabitants of every country are\ncontinually circulating, and towards which they are always tending,\nthough, by particular causes, they may sometimes be driven off and\nrepelled from it towards more distant employments. But a capital employed\nin the home trade, it has already been shown, necessarily puts into motion\na greater quantity of domestic industry, and gives revenue and employment\nto a greater number of the inhabitants of the country, than an equal\ncapital employed in the foreign trade of consumption; and one employed in\nthe foreign trade of consumption has the same advantage over an equal\ncapital employed in the carrying trade. Upon equal, or only nearly equal\nprofits, therefore, every individual naturally inclines to employ his\ncapital in the manner in which it is likely to afford the greatest support\nto domestic industry, and to give revenue and employment to the greatest\nnumber of people of his own country.\nSecondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of\ndomestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that\nits produce may be of the greatest possible value.\nThe produce of industry is what it adds to the subject or materials upon\nwhich it is employed. In proportion as the value of this produce is great\nor small, so will likewise be the profits of the employer. But it is only\nfor the sake of profit that any man employs a capital in the support of\nindustry; and he will always, therefore, endeavour to employ it in the\nsupport of that industry of which the produce is likely to be of the\ngreatest value, or to exchange for the greatest quantity either of money\nor of other goods.\nBut the annual revenue of every society is always precisely equal to the\nexchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its industry, or rather\nis precisely the same thing with that exchangeable value. As every\nindividual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his\ncapital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that\nindustry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual\nnecessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great\nas he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public\ninterest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support\nof domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security;\nand by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of\nthe greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in\nmany other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no\npart of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it\nwas no part of it. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes\nthat of the society more effectually than when he really intends to\npromote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to\ntrade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common\namong merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them\nfrom it.\nWhat is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ, and\nof which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every\nindividual, it is evident, can in his local situation judge much better\nthan any statesman or lawgiver can do for him. The statesman, who should\nattempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their\ncapitals, would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention,\nbut assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no\nsingle person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would\nnowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and\npresumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.\nTo give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic\nindustry, in any particular art or manufacture, is in some measure to\ndirect private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals,\nand must in almost all cases be either a useless or a hurtful regulation.\nIf the produce of domestic can be brought there as cheap as that of\nforeign industry, the regulation is evidently useless. If it cannot, it\nmust generally be hurtful. It is the maxim of every prudent master of a\nfamily, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to\nmake than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but\nbuys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own\nclothes, but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one\nnor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it\nfor their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they\nhave some advantage over their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of\nits produce, or, what is the same thing, with the price of a part of it,\nwhatever else they have occasion for.\nWhat is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be\nfolly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with\na commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them\nwith some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in\nwhich we have some advantage. The general industry of the country being\nalways in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be\ndiminished, no more than that of the abovementioned artificers; but only\nleft to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest\nadvantage. It is certainly not employed to the greatest advantage, when it\nis thus directed towards an object which it can buy cheaper than it can\nmake. The value of its annual produce is certainly more or less\ndiminished, when it is thus turned away from producing commodities\nevidently of more value than the commodity which it is directed to\nproduce. According to the supposition, that commodity could be purchased\nfrom foreign countries cheaper than it can be made at home; it could\ntherefore have been purchased with a part only of the commodities, or,\nwhat is the same thing, with a part only of the price of the commodities,\nwhich the industry employed by an equal capital would have produced at\nhome, had it been left to follow its natural course. The industry of the\ncountry, therefore, is thus turned away from a more to a less advantageous\nemployment; and the exchangeable value of its annual produce, instead of\nbeing increased, according to the intention of the lawgiver, must\nnecessarily be diminished by every such regulation.\nBy means of such regulations, indeed, a particular manufacture may\nsometimes be acquired sooner than it could have been otherwise, and after\na certain time may be made at home as cheap, or cheaper, than in the\nforeign country. But though the industry of the society may be thus\ncarried with advantage into a particular channel sooner than it could have\nbeen otherwise, it will by no means follow that the sum-total, either of\nits industry, or of its revenue, can ever be augmented by any such\nregulation. The industry of the society can augment only in proportion as\nits capital augments, and its capital can augment only in proportion to\nwhat can be gradually saved out of its revenue. But the immediate effect\nof every such regulation is to diminish its revenue; and what diminishes\nits revenue is certainly not very likely to augment its capital faster\nthan it would have augmented of its own accord, had both capital and\nindustry been left to find out their natural employments.\nThough, for want of such regulations, the society should never acquire the\nproposed manufacture, it would not upon that account necessarily be the\npoorer in anyone period of its duration. In every period of its duration\nits whole capital and industry might still have been employed, though upon\ndifferent objects, in the manner that was most advantageous at the time.\nIn every period its revenue might have been the greatest which its capital\ncould afford, and both capital and revenue might have been augmented with\nthe greatest possible rapidity.\nThe natural advantages which one country has over another, in producing\nparticular commodities, are sometimes so great, that it is acknowledged by\nall the world to be in vain to struggle with them. By means of glasses,\nhot-beds, and hot-walls, very good grapes can be raised in Scotland, and\nvery good wine, too, can be made of them, at about thirty times the\nexpense for which at least equally good can be brought from foreign\ncountries. Would it be a reasonable law to prohibit the importation of all\nforeign wines, merely to encourage the making of claret and Burgundy in\nScotland? But if there would be a manifest absurdity in turning towards\nany employment thirty times more of the capital and industry of the\ncountry than would be necessary to purchase from foreign countries an\nequal quantity of the commodities wanted, there must be an absurdity,\nthough not altogether so glaring, yet exactly of the same kind, in turning\ntowards any such employment a thirtieth, or even a three hundredth part\nmore of either. Whether the advantages which one country has over another\nbe natural or acquired, is in this respect of no consequence. As long as\nthe one country has those advantages, and the other wants them, it will\nalways be more advantageous for the latter rather to buy of the former\nthan to make. It is an acquired advantage only, which one artificer has\nover his neighbour, who exercises another trade; and yet they both find it\nmore advantageous to buy of one another, than to make what does not belong\nto their particular trades.\nMerchants and manufacturers are the people who derive the greatest\nadvantage from this monopoly of the home market. The prohibition of the\nimportation of foreign cattle and of salt provisions, together with the\nhigh duties upon foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to\na prohibition, are not near so advantageous to the graziers and farmers of\nGreat Britain, as other regulations of the same kind are to its merchants\nand manufacturers. Manufactures, those of the finer kind especially, are\nmore easily transported from one country to another than corn or cattle.\nIt is in the fetching and carrying manufactures, accordingly, that foreign\ntrade is chiefly employed. In manufactures, a very small advantage will\nenable foreigners to undersell our own workmen, even in the home market.\nIt will require a very great one to enable them to do so in the rude\nproduce of the soil. If the free importation of foreign manufactures were\npermitted, several of the home manufactures would probably suffer, and\nsome of them perhaps go to ruin altogether, and a considerable part of the\nstock and industry at present employed in them, would be forced to find\nout some other employment. But the freest importation of the rude produce\nof the soil could have no such effect upon the agriculture of the country.\nIf the importation of foreign cattle, for example, were made ever so free,\nso few could be imported, that the grazing trade of Great Britain could be\nlittle affected by it. Live cattle are, perhaps, the only commodity of\nwhich the transportation is more expensive by sea than by land. By land\nthey carry themselves to market. By sea, not only the cattle, but their\nfood and their water too, must be carried at no small expense and\ninconveniency. The short sea between Ireland and Great Britain, indeed,\nrenders the importation of Irish cattle more easy. But though the free\nimportation of them, which was lately permitted only for a limited time,\nwere rendered perpetual, it could have no considerable effect upon the\ninterest of the graziers of Great Britain. Those parts of Great Britain\nwhich border upon the Irish sea are all grazing countries. Irish cattle\ncould never be imported for their use, but must be drove through those\nvery extensive countries, at no small expense and inconveniency, before\nthey could arrive at their proper market. Fat cattle could not be drove so\nfar. Lean cattle, therefore, could only be imported; and such importation\ncould interfere not with the interest of the feeding or fattening\ncountries, to which, by reducing the price of lean cattle it would rather\nbe advantageous, but with that of the breeding countries only. The small\nnumber of Irish cattle imported since their importation was permitted,\ntogether with the good price at which lean cattle still continue to sell,\nseem to demonstrate, that even the breeding countries of Great Britain are\nnever likely to be much affected by the free importation of Irish cattle.\nThe common people of Ireland, indeed, are said to have sometimes opposed\nwith violence the exportation of their cattle. But if the exporters had\nfound any great advantage in continuing the trade, they could easily, when\nthe law was on their side, have conquered this mobbish opposition.\nFeeding and fattening countries, besides, must always be highly improved,\nwhereas breeding countries are generally uncultivated. The high price of\nlean cattle, by augmenting the value of uncultivated land, is like a\nbounty against improvement. To any country which was highly improved\nthroughout, it would be more advantageous to import its lean cattle than\nto breed them. The province of Holland, accordingly, is said to follow\nthis maxim at present. The mountains of Scotland, Wales, and\nNorthumberland, indeed, are countries not capable of much improvement, and\nseem destined by nature to be the breeding countries of Great Britain. The\nfreest importation of foreign cattle could have no other effect than to\nhinder those breeding countries from taking advantage of the increasing\npopulation and improvement of the rest of the kingdom, from raising their\nprice to an exorbitant height, and from laying a real tax upon all the\nmore improved and cultivated parts of the country.\nThe freest importation of salt provisions, in the same manner, could have\nas little effect upon the interest of the graziers of Great Britain as\nthat of live cattle. Salt provisions are not only a very bulky commodity,\nbut when compared with fresh meat they are a commodity both of worse\nquality, and, as they cost more labour and expense, of higher price. They\ncould never, therefore, come into competition with the fresh meat, though\nthey might with the salt provisions of the country. They might be used for\nvictualling ships for distant voyages, and such like uses, but could never\nmake any considerable part of the food of the people. The small quantity\nof salt provisions imported from Ireland since their importation was\nrendered free, is an experimental proof that our graziers have nothing to\napprehend from it. It does not appear that the price of butcher\u2019s meat has\never been sensibly affected by it.\nEven the free importation of foreign corn could very little affect the\ninterest of the farmers of Great Britain. Corn is a much more bulky\ncommodity than butcher\u2019s meat. A pound of wheat at a penny is as dear as a\npound of butcher\u2019s meat at fourpence. The small quantity of foreign corn\nimported even in times of the greatest scarcity, may satisfy our farmers\nthat they can have nothing to fear from the freest importation. The\naverage quantity imported, one year with another, amounts only, according\nto the very well informed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, to\n23,728 quarters of all sorts of grain, and does not exceed the five\nhundredth and seventy-one part of the annual consumption. But as the\nbounty upon corn occasions a greater exportation in years of plenty, so it\nmust, of consequence, occasion a greater importation in years of scarcity,\nthan in the actual state of tillage would otherwise take place. By means\nof it, the plenty of one year does not compensate the scarcity of another;\nand as the average quantity exported is necessarily augmented by it, so\nmust likewise, in the actual state of tillage, the average quantity\nimported. If there were no bounty, as less corn would be exported, so it\nis probable that, one year with another, less would be imported than at\npresent. The corn-merchants, the fetchers and carriers of corn between\nGreat Britain and foreign countries, would have much less employment, and\nmight suffer considerably; but the country gentlemen and farmers could\nsuffer very little. It is in the corn-merchants, accordingly, rather than\nthe country gentlemen and farmers, that I have observed the greatest\nanxiety for the renewal and continuation of the bounty.\nCountry gentlemen and farmers are, to their great honour, of all people,\nthe least subject to the wretched spirit of monopoly. The undertaker of a\ngreat manufactory is sometimes alarmed if another work of the same kind is\nestablished within twenty miles of him; the Dutch undertaker of the\nwoollen manufacture at Abbeville, stipulated that no work of the same kind\nshould be established within thirty leagues of that city. Farmers and\ncountry gentlemen, on the contrary, are generally disposed rather to\npromote, than to obstruct, the cultivation and improvement of their\nneighbours farms and estates. They have no secrets, such as those of the\ngreater part of manufacturers, but are generally rather fond of\ncommunicating to their neighbours, and of extending as far as possible any\nnew practice which they may have found to be advantageous. \u201cPius\nquaestus\u201d, says old Cato, \u201cstabilissimusque, minimeque invidiosus;\nminimeque male cogitantes sunt, qui in eo studio occupati sunt.\u201d Country\ngentlemen and farmers, dispersed in different parts of the country, cannot\nso easily combine as merchants and manufacturers, who being collected into\ntowns, and accustomed to that exclusive corporation spirit which prevails\nin them, naturally endeavour to obtain, against all their countrymen, the\nsame exclusive privilege which they generally possess against the\ninhabitants of their respective towns. They accordingly seem to have been\nthe original inventors of those restraints upon the importation of foreign\ngoods, which secure to them the monopoly of the home market. It was\nprobably in imitation of them, and to put themselves upon a level with\nthose who, they found, were disposed to oppress them, that the country\ngentlemen and farmers of Great Britain so far forgot the generosity which\nis natural to their station, as to demand the exclusive privilege of\nsupplying their countrymen with corn and butcher\u2019s meat. They did not,\nperhaps, take time to consider how much less their interest could be\naffected by the freedom of trade, than that of the people whose example\nthey followed.\nTo prohibit, by a perpetual law, the importation of foreign corn and\ncattle, is in reality to enact, that the population and industry of the\ncountry shall, at no time, exceed what the rude produce of its own soil\ncan maintain.\nThere seem, however, to be two cases, in which it will generally be\nadvantageous to lay some burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of\ndomestic industry.\nThe first is, when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the\ndefence of the country. The defence of Great Britain, for example, depends\nvery much upon the number of its sailors and shipping. The act of\nnavigation, therefore, very properly endeavours to give the sailors and\nshipping of Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country,\nin some cases, by absolute prohibitions, and in others, by heavy burdens\nupon the shipping of foreign countries. The following are the principal\ndispositions of this act.\nFirst, All ships, of which the owners, masters, and three-fourths of the\nmariners, are not British subjects, are prohibited, upon pain of\nforfeiting ship and cargo, from trading to the British settlements and\nplantations, or from being employed in the coasting trade of Great\nBritain.\nSecondly, A great variety of the most bulky articles of importation can be\nbrought into Great Britain only, either in such ships as are above\ndescribed, or in ships of the country where those goods are produced, and\nof which the owners, masters, and three-fourths of the mariners, are of\nthat particular country; and when imported even in ships of this latter\nkind, they are subject to double aliens duty. If imported in ships of any\nother country, the penalty is forfeiture of ship and goods. When this act\nwas made, the Dutch were, what they still are, the great carriers of\nEurope; and by this regulation they were entirely excluded from being the\ncarriers to Great Britain, or from importing to us the goods of any other\nEuropean country.\nThirdly, A great variety of the most bulky articles of importation are\nprohibited from being imported, even in British ships, from any country\nbut that in which they are produced, under pain of forfeiting ship and\ncargo. This regulation, too, was probably intended against the Dutch.\nHolland was then, as now, the great emporium for all European goods; and\nby this regulation, British ships were hindered from loading in Holland\nthe goods of any other European country.\nFourthly, Salt fish of all kinds, whale fins, whalebone, oil, and blubber,\nnot caught by and cured on board British vessels, when imported into Great\nBritain, are subject to double aliens duty. The Dutch, as they are still\nthe principal, were then the only fishers in Europe that attempted to\nsupply foreign nations with fish. By this regulation, a very heavy burden\nwas laid upon their supplying Great Britain.\nWhen the act of navigation was made, though England and Holland were not\nactually at war, the most violent animosity subsisted between the two\nnations. It had begun during the government of the long parliament, which\nfirst framed this act, and it broke out soon after in the Dutch wars,\nduring that of the Protector and of Charles II. It is not impossible,\ntherefore, that some of the regulations of this famous act may have\nproceeded from national animosity. They are as wise, however, as if they\nhad all been dictated by the most deliberate wisdom. National animosity,\nat that particular time, aimed at the very same object which the most\ndeliberate wisdom would have recommended, the diminution of the naval\npower of Holland, the only naval power which could endanger the security\nof England.\nThe act of navigation is not favourable to foreign commerce, or to the\ngrowth of that opulence which can arise from it. The interest of a nation,\nin its commercial relations to foreign nations, is, like that of a\nmerchant with regard to the different people with whom he deals, to buy as\ncheap, and to sell as dear as possible. But it will be most likely to buy\ncheap, when, by the most perfect freedom of trade, it encourages all\nnations to bring to it the goods which it has occasion to purchase; and,\nfor the same reason, it will be most likely to sell dear, when its markets\nare thus filled with the greatest number of buyers. The act of navigation,\nit is true, lays no burden upon foreign ships that come to export the\nproduce of British industry. Even the ancient aliens duty, which used to\nbe paid upon all goods, exported as well as imported, has, by several\nsubsequent acts, been taken off from the greater part of the articles of\nexportation. But if foreigners, either by prohibitions or high duties, are\nhindered from coming to sell, they cannot always afford to come to buy;\nbecause, coming without a cargo, they must lose the freight from their own\ncountry to Great Britain. By diminishing the number of sellers, therefore,\nwe necessarily diminish that of buyers, and are thus likely not only to\nbuy foreign goods dearer, but to sell our own cheaper, than if there was a\nmore perfect freedom of trade. As defence, however, is of much more\nimportance than opulence, the act of navigation is, perhaps, the wisest of\nall the commercial regulations of England.\nThe second case, in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some\nburden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, is when\nsome tax is imposed at home upon the produce of the latter. In this case,\nit seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed upon the like\nproduce of the former. This would not give the monopoly of the home\nmarket to domestic industry, nor turn towards a particular employment a\ngreater share of the stock and labour of the country, than what would\nnaturally go to it. It would only hinder any part of what would naturally\ngo to it from being turned away by the tax into a less natural direction,\nand would leave the competition between foreign and domestic industry,\nafter the tax, as nearly as possible upon the same footing as before it.\nIn Great Britain, when any such tax is laid upon the produce of domestic\nindustry, it is usual, at the same time, in order to stop the clamorous\ncomplaints of our merchants and manufacturers, that they will be undersold\nat home, to lay a much heavier duty upon the importation of all foreign\ngoods of the same kind.\nThis second limitation of the freedom of trade, according to some people,\nshould, upon most occasions, be extended much farther than to the precise\nforeign commodities which could come into competition with those which had\nbeen taxed at home. When the necessaries of life have been taxed in any\ncountry, it becomes proper, they pretend, to tax not only the like\nnecessaries of life imported from other countries, but all sorts of\nforeign goods which can come into competition with any thing that is the\nproduce of domestic industry. Subsistence, they say, becomes necessarily\ndearer in consequence of such taxes; and the price of labour must always\nrise with the price of the labourer\u2019s subsistence. Every commodity,\ntherefore, which is the produce of domestic industry, though not\nimmediately taxed itself, becomes dearer in consequence of such taxes,\nbecause the labour which produces it becomes so. Such taxes, therefore,\nare really equivalent, they say, to a tax upon every particular commodity\nproduced at home. In order to put domestic upon the same footing with\nforeign industry, therefore, it becomes necessary, they think, to lay some\nduty upon every foreign commodity, equal to this enhancement of the price\nof the home commodities with which it can come into competition.\nWhether taxes upon the necessaries of life, such as those in Great Britain\nupon soap, salt, leather, candles, etc. necessarily raise the price of\nlabour, and consequently that of all other commodities, I shall consider\nhereafter, when I come to treat of taxes. Supposing, however, in the mean\ntime, that they have this effect, and they have it undoubtedly, this\ngeneral enhancement of the price of all commodities, in consequence of\nthat labour, is a case which differs in the two following respects from\nthat of a particular commodity, of which the price was enhanced by a\nparticular tax immediately imposed upon it.\nFirst, It might always be known with great exactness, how far the price of\nsuch a commodity could be enhanced by such a tax; but how far the general\nenhancement of the price of labour might affect that of every different\ncommodity about which labour was employed, could never be known with any\ntolerable exactness. It would be impossible, therefore, to proportion,\nwith any tolerable exactness, the tax of every foreign, to the enhancement\nof the price of every home commodity.\nSecondly, Taxes upon the necessaries of life have nearly the same effect\nupon the circumstances of the people as a poor soil and a bad climate.\nProvisions are thereby rendered dearer, in the same manner as if it\nrequired extraordinary labour and expense to raise them. As, in the\nnatural scarcity arising from soil and climate, it would be absurd to\ndirect the people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals and\nindustry, so is it likewise in the artificial scarcity arising from such\ntaxes. To be left to accommodate, as well as they could, their industry to\ntheir situation, and to find out those employments in which,\nnotwithstanding their unfavourable circumstances, they might have some\nadvantage either in the home or in the foreign market, is what, in both\ncases, would evidently be most for their advantage. To lay a new-tax upon\nthem, because they are already overburdened with taxes, and because they\nalready pay too dear for the necessaries of life, to make them likewise\npay too dear for the greater part of other commodities, is certainly a\nmost absurd way of making amends.\nSuch taxes, when they have grown up to a certain height, are a curse equal\nto the barrenness of the earth, and the inclemency of the heavens, and yet\nit is in the richest and most industrious countries that they have been\nmost generally imposed. No other countries could support so great a\ndisorder. As the strongest bodies only can live and enjoy health under an\nunwholesome regimen, so the nations only, that in every sort of industry\nhave the greatest natural and acquired advantages, can subsist and prosper\nunder such taxes. Holland is the country in Europe in which they abound\nmost, and which, from peculiar circumstances, continues to prosper, not by\nmeans of them, as has been most absurdly supposed, but in spite of them.\nAs there are two cases in which it will generally be advantageous to lay\nsome burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, so\nthere are two others in which it may sometimes be a matter of\ndeliberation, in the one, how far it is proper to continue the free\nimportation of certain foreign goods; and, in the other, how far, or in\nwhat manner, it may be proper to restore that free importation, after it\nhas been for some time interrupted.\nThe case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how far it\nis proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods, is\nwhen some foreign nation restrains, by high duties or prohibitions, the\nimportation of some of our manufactures into their country. Revenge, in\nthis case, naturally dictates retaliation, and that we should impose the\nlike duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their\nmanufactures into ours. Nations, accordingly, seldom fail to retaliate in\nthis manner. The French have been particularly forward to favour their own\nmanufactures, by restraining the importation of such foreign goods as\ncould come into competition with them. In this consisted a great part of\nthe policy of Mr Colbert, who, notwithstanding his great abilities, seems\nin this case to have been imposed upon by the sophistry of merchants and\nmanufacturers, who are always demanding a monopoly against their\ncountrymen. It is at present the opinion of the most intelligent men in\nFrance, that his operations of this kind have not been beneficial to his\ncountry. That minister, by the tariff of 1667, imposed very high duties\nupon a great number of foreign manufactures. Upon his refusing to moderate\nthem in favour of the Dutch, they, in 1671, prohibited the importation of\nthe wines, brandies, and manufactures of France. The war of 1672 seems to\nhave been in part occasioned by this commercial dispute. The peace of\nNimeguen put an end to it in 1678, by moderating some of those duties in\nfavour of the Dutch, who in consequence took off their prohibition. It was\nabout the same time that the French and English began mutually to oppress\neach other\u2019s industry, by the like duties and prohibitions, of which the\nFrench, however, seem to have set the first example, The spirit of\nhostility which has subsisted between the two nations ever since, has\nhitherto hindered them from being moderated on either side. In 1697, the\nEnglish prohibited the importation of bone lace, the manufacture of\nFlanders. The government of that country, at that time under the dominion\nof Spain, prohibited, in return, the importation of English woollens. In\n1700, the prohibition of importing bone lace into England was taken off\nupon condition that the importation of English woollens into Flanders\nshould be put on the same footing as before.\nThere may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a\nprobability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or\nprohibitions complained of. The recovery of a great foreign market will\ngenerally more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying\ndearer during a short time for some sorts of goods. To judge whether such\nretaliations are likely to produce such an effect, does not, perhaps,\nbelong so much to the science of a legislator, whose deliberations ought\nto be governed by general principles, which are always the same, as to the\nskill of that insidious and crafty animal vulgarly called a statesman or\npolitician, whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of\naffairs. When there is no probability that any such repeal can be\nprocured, it seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain\nclasses of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those\nclasses, but to almost all the other classes of them. When our neighbours\nprohibit some manufacture of ours, we generally prohibit, not only the\nsame, for that alone would seldom affect them considerably, but some other\nmanufacture of theirs. This may, no doubt, give encouragement to some\nparticular class of workmen among ourselves, and, by excluding some of\ntheir rivals, may enable them to raise their price in the home market.\nThose workmen however, who suffered by our neighbours prohibition, will\nnot be benefited by ours. On the contrary, they, and almost all the other\nclasses of our citizens, will thereby be obliged to pay dearer than before\nfor certain goods. Every such law, therefore, imposes a real tax upon the\nwhole country, not in favour of that particular class of workmen who were\ninjured by our neighbours prohibitions, but of some other class.\nThe case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, how far,\nor in what manner, it is proper to restore the free importation of foreign\ngoods, after it has been for some time interrupted, is when particular\nmanufactures, by means of high duties or prohibitions upon all foreign\ngoods which can come into competition with them, have been so far extended\nas to employ a great multitude of hands. Humanity may in this case require\nthat the freedom of trade should be restored only by slow gradations, and\nwith a good deal of reserve and circumspection. Were those high duties and\nprohibitions taken away all at once, cheaper foreign goods of the same\nkind might be poured so fast into the home market, as to deprive all at\nonce many thousands of our people of their ordinary employment and means\nof subsistence. The disorder which this would occasion might no doubt be\nvery considerable. It would in all probability, however, be much less than\nis commonly imagined, for the two following reasons.\nFirst, All those manufactures of which any part is commonly exported to\nother European countries without a bounty, could be very little affected\nby the freest importation of foreign goods. Such manufactures must be sold\nas cheap abroad as any other foreign goods of the same quality and kind,\nand consequently must be sold cheaper at home. They would still,\ntherefore, keep possession of the home market; and though a capricious man\nof fashion might sometimes prefer foreign wares, merely because they were\nforeign, to cheaper and better goods of the same kind that were made at\nhome, this folly could, from the nature of things, extend to so few, that\nit could make no sensible impression upon the general employment of the\npeople. But a great part of all the different branches of our woollen\nmanufacture, of our tanned leather, and of our hardware, are annually\nexported to other European countries without any bounty, and these are the\nmanufactures which employ the greatest number of hands. The silk, perhaps,\nis the manufacture which would suffer the most by this freedom of trade,\nand after it the linen, though the latter much less than the former.\nSecondly, Though a great number of people should, by thus restoring the\nfreedom of trade, be thrown all at once out of their ordinary employment\nand common method of subsistence, it would by no means follow that they\nwould thereby be deprived either of employment or subsistence. By the\nreduction of the army and navy at the end of the late war, more than\n100,000 soldiers and seamen, a number equal to what is employed in the\ngreatest manufactures, were all at once thrown out of their ordinary\nemployment: but though they no doubt suffered some inconveniency, they\nwere not thereby deprived of all employment and subsistence. The greater\npart of the seamen, it is probable, gradually betook themselves to the\nmerchant service as they could find occasion, and in the mean time both\nthey and the soldiers were absorbed in the great mass of the people, and\nemployed in a great variety of occupations. Not only no great convulsion,\nbut no sensible disorder, arose from so great a change in the situation of\nmore than 100,000 men, all accustomed to the use of arms, and many of them\nto rapine and plunder. The number of vagrants was scarce anywhere sensibly\nincreased by it; even the wages of labour were not reduced by it in any\noccupation, so far as I have been able to learn, except in that of seamen\nin the merchant service. But if we compare together the habits of a\nsoldier and of any sort of manufacturer, we shall find that those of the\nlatter do not tend so much to disqualify him from being employed in a new\ntrade, as those of the former from being employed in any. The manufacturer\nhas always been accustomed to look for his subsistence from his labour\nonly; the soldier to expect it from his pay. Application and industry have\nbeen familiar to the one; idleness and dissipation to the other. But it is\nsurely much easier to change the direction of industry from one sort of\nlabour to another, than to turn idleness and dissipation to any. To the\ngreater part of manufactures, besides, it has already been observed, there\nare other collateral manufactures of so similar a nature, that a workman\ncan easily transfer his industry from one of them to another. The greater\npart of such workmen, too, are occasionally employed in country labour.\nThe stock which employed them in a particular manufacture before, will\nstill remain in the country, to employ an equal number of people in some\nother way. The capital of the country remaining the same, the demand for\nlabour will likewise be the same, or very nearly the same, though it may\nbe exerted in different places, and for different occupations. Soldiers\nand seamen, indeed, when discharged from the king\u2019s service, are at\nliberty to exercise any trade within any town or place of Great Britain or\nIreland. Let the same natural liberty of exercising what species of\nindustry they please, be restored to all his Majesty\u2019s subjects, in the\nsame manner as to soldiers and seamen; that is, break down the exclusive\nprivileges of corporations, and repeal the statute of apprenticeship, both\nwhich are really encroachments upon natural Liberty, and add to those the\nrepeal of the law of settlements, so that a poor workman, when thrown out\nof employment, either in one trade or in one place, may seek for it in\nanother trade or in another place, without the fear either of a\nprosecution or of a removal; and neither the public nor the individuals\nwill suffer much more from the occasional disbanding some particular\nclasses of manufacturers, than from that of the soldiers. Our\nmanufacturers have no doubt great merit with their country, but they\ncannot have more than those who defend it with their blood, nor deserve to\nbe treated with more delicacy.\nTo expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely\nrestored in Great Britain, is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or\nUtopia should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the\npublic, but, what is much more unconquerable, the private interests of\nmany individuals, irresistibly oppose it. Were the officers of the army to\noppose, with the same zeal and unanimity, any reduction in the number of\nforces, with which master manufacturers set themselves against every law\nthat is likely to increase the number of their rivals in the home market;\nwere the former to animate their soldiers, in the same manner as the\nlatter inflame their workmen, to attack with violence and outrage the\nproposers of any such regulation; to attempt to reduce the army would be\nas dangerous as it has now become to attempt to diminish, in any respect,\nthe monopoly which our manufacturers have obtained against us. This\nmonopoly has so much increased the number of some particular tribes of\nthem, that, like an overgrown standing army, they have become formidable\nto the government, and, upon many occasions, intimidate the legislature.\nThe member of parliament who supports every proposal for strengthening\nthis monopoly, is sure to acquire not only the reputation of understanding\ntrade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men whose\nnumbers and wealth render them of great importance. If he opposes them, on\nthe contrary, and still more, if he has authority enough to be able to\nthwart them, neither the most acknowledged probity, nor the highest rank,\nnor the greatest public services, can protect him from the most infamous\nabuse and detraction, from personal insults, nor sometimes from real\ndanger, arising from the insolent outrage of furious and disappointed\nmonopolists.\nThe undertaker of a great manufacture, who, by the home markets being\nsuddenly laid open to the competition of foreigners, should be obliged to\nabandon his trade, would no doubt suffer very considerably. That part of\nhis capital which had usually been employed in purchasing materials, and\nin paying his workmen, might, without much difficulty, perhaps, find\nanother employment; but that part of it which was fixed in workhouses, and\nin the instruments of trade, could scarce be disposed of without\nconsiderable loss. The equitable regard, therefore, to his interest,\nrequires that changes of this kind should never be introduced suddenly,\nbut slowly, gradually, and after a very long warning. The legislature,\nwere it possible that its deliberations could be always directed, not by\nthe clamorous importunity of partial interests, but by an extensive view\nof the general good, ought, upon this very account, perhaps, to be\nparticularly careful, neither to establish any new monopolies of this\nkind, nor to extend further those which are already established. Every\nsuch regulation introduces some degree of real disorder into the\nconstitution of the state, which it will be difficult afterwards to cure\nwithout occasioning another disorder.\nHow far it may be proper to impose taxes upon the importation of foreign\ngoods, in order not to prevent their importation, but to raise a revenue\nfor government, I shall consider hereafter when I come to treat of taxes.\nTaxes imposed with a view to prevent, or even to diminish importation, are\nevidently as destructive of the revenue of the customs as of the freedom\nof trade.\nCHAPTER III.\nOF THE EXTRAORDINARY RESTRAINTS UPON\nTHE IMPORTATION OF GOODS OF ALMOST ALL KINDS, FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WITH WHICH\nTHE BALANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DISADVANTAGEOUS.\nPart I\u2014Of the Unreasonableness of those Restraints, even upon the\nPrinciples of the Commercial System.\nTo lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods of almost\nall kinds, from those particular countries with which the balance of trade\nis supposed to be disadvantageous, is the second expedient by which the\ncommercial system proposes to increase the quantity of gold and silver.\nThus, in Great Britain, Silesia lawns may be imported for home\nconsumption, upon paying certain duties; but French cambrics and lawns are\nprohibited to be imported, except into the port of London, there to be\nwarehoused for exportation. Higher duties are imposed upon the wines of\nFrance than upon those of Portugal, or indeed of any other country. By\nwhat is called the impost 1692, a duty of five and-twenty per cent. of the\nrate or value, was laid upon all French goods; while the goods of other\nnations were, the greater part of them, subjected to much lighter duties,\nseldom exceeding five per cent. The wine, brandy, salt, and vinegar of\nFrance, were indeed excepted; these commodities being subjected to other\nheavy duties, either by other laws, or by particular clauses of the same\nlaw. In 1696, a second duty of twenty-five per cent. the first not having\nbeen thought a sufficient discouragement, was imposed upon all French\ngoods, except brandy; together with a new duty of five-and-twenty pounds\nupon the ton of French wine, and another of fifteen pounds upon the ton of\nFrench vinegar. French goods have never been omitted in any of those\ngeneral subsidies or duties of five per cent. which have been imposed upon\nall, or the greater part, of the goods enumerated in the book of rates. If\nwe count the one-third and two-third subsidies as making a complete\nsubsidy between them, there have been five of these general subsidies; so\nthat, before the commencement of the present war, seventy-five per cent.\nmay be considered as the lowest duty to which the greater part of the\ngoods of the growth, produce, or manufacture of France, were liable. But\nupon the greater part of goods, those duties are equivalent to a\nprohibition. The French, in their turn, have, I believe, treated our goods\nand manufactures just as hardly; though I am not so well acquainted with\nthe particular hardships which they have imposed upon them. Those mutual\nrestraints have put an end to almost all fair commerce between the two\nnations; and smugglers are now the principal importers, either of British\ngoods into France, or of French goods into Great Britain. The principles\nwhich I have been examining, in the foregoing chapter, took their origin\nfrom private interest and the spirit of monopoly; those which I am going\nte examine in this, from national prejudice and animosity. They are,\naccordingly, as might well be expected, still more unreasonable. They are\nso, even upon the principles of the commercial system.\nFirst, Though it were certain that in the case of a free trade between\nFrance and England, for example, the balance would be in favour of France,\nit would by no means follow that such a trade would be disadvantageous to\nEngland, or that the general balance of its whole trade would thereby be\nturned more against it. If the wines of France are better and cheaper than\nthose of Portugal, or its linens than those of Germany, it would be more\nadvantageous for Great Britain to purchase both the wine and the foreign\nlinen which it had occasion for of France, than of Portugal and Germany.\nThough the value of the annual importations from France would thereby be\ngreatly augmented, the value of the whole annual importations would be\ndiminished, in proportion as the French goods of the same quality were\ncheaper than those of the other two countries. This would be the case,\neven upon the supposition that the whole French goods imported were to be\nconsumed in Great Britain.\nBut, Secondly, A great part of them might be re-exported to other\ncountries, where, being sold with profit, they might bring back a return,\nequal in value, perhaps, to the prime cost of the whole French goods\nimported. What has frequently been said of the East India trade, might\npossibly be true of the French; that though the greater part of East India\ngoods were bought with gold and silver, the re-exportation of a part of\nthem to other countries brought back more gold and silver to that which\ncarried on the trade, than the prime cost of the whole amounted to. One of\nthe most important branches of the Dutch trade at present, consists in the\ncarriage of French goods to other European countries. Some part even of\nthe French wine drank in Great Britain, is clandestinely imported from\nHolland and Zealand. If there was either a free trade between France and\nEngland, or if French goods could be imported upon paying only the same\nduties as those of other European nations, to be drawn back upon\nexportation, England might have some share of a trade which is found so\nadvantageous to Holland.\nThirdly, and lastly, There is no certain criterion by which we can\ndetermine on which side what is called the balance between any two\ncountries lies, or which of them exports to the greatest value. National\nprejudice and animosity, prompted always by the private interest of\nparticular traders, are the principles which generally direct our judgment\nupon all questions concerning it. There are two criterions, however, which\nhave frequently been appealed to upon such occasions, the custom-house\nbooks and the course of exchange. The custom-house books, I think, it is\nnow generally acknowledged, are a very uncertain criterion, on account of\nthe inaccuracy of the valuation at which the greater part of goods are\nrated in them. The course of exchange is, perhaps, almost equally so.\nWhen the exchange between two places, such as London and Paris, is at par,\nit is said to be a sign that the debts due from London to Paris are\ncompensated by those due from Paris to London. On the contrary, when a\npremium is paid at London for a bill upon Paris, it is said to be a sign\nthat the debts due from London to Paris are not compensated by those due\nfrom Paris to London, but that a balance in money must be sent out from\nthe latter place; for the risk, trouble, and expense, of exporting which,\nthe premium is both demanded and given. But the ordinary state of debt and\ncredit between those two cities must necessarily be regulated, it is said,\nby the ordinary course of their dealings with one another. When neither of\nthem imports from from other to a greater amount than it exports to that\nother, the debts and credits of each may compensate one another. But when\none of them imports from the other to a greater value than it exports to\nthat other, the former necessarily becomes indebted to the latter in a\ngreater sum than the latter becomes indebted to it: the debts and credits\nof each do not compensate one another, and money must be sent out from\nthat place of which the debts overbalance the credits. The ordinary course\nof exchange, therefore, being an indication of the ordinary state of debt\nand credit between two places, must likewise be an indication of the\nordinary course of their exports and imports, as these necessarily\nregulate that state.\nBut though the ordinary course of exchange shall be allowed to be a\nsufficient indication of the ordinary state of debt and credit between any\ntwo places, it would not from thence follow, that the balance of trade was\nin favour of that place which had the ordinary state of debt and credit in\nits favour. The ordinary state of debt and credit between any two places\nis not always entirely regulated by the ordinary course of their dealings\nwith one another, but is often influenced by that of the dealings of\neither with many other places. If it is usual, for example, for the\nmerchants of England to pay for the goods which they buy of Hamburg,\nDantzic, Riga, etc. by bills upon Holland, the ordinary state of debt and\ncredit between England and Holland will not be regulated entirely by the\nordinary course of the dealings of those two countries with one another,\nbut will be influenced by that of the dealings in England with those other\nplaces. England may be obliged to send out every year money to Holland,\nthough its annual exports to that country may exceed very much the annual\nvalue of its imports from thence, and though what is called the balance of\ntrade may be very much in favour of England.\nIn the way, besides, in which the par of exchange has hitherto been\ncomputed, the ordinary course of exchange can afford no sufficient\nindication that the ordinary state of debt and credit is in favour of that\ncountry which seems to have, or which is supposed to have, the ordinary\ncourse of exchange in its favour; or, in other words, the real exchange\nmay be, and in fact often is, so very different from the computed one,\nthat, from the course of the latter, no certain conclusion can, upon many\noccasions, be drawn concerning that of the former.\nWhen for a sum or money paid in England, containing, according to the\nstandard of the English mint, a certain number of ounces of pure silver,\nyou receive a bill for a sum of money to be paid in France, containing,\naccording to the standard of the French mint, an equal number of ounces of\npure silver, exchange is said to be at par between England and France.\nWhen you pay more, you are supposed to give a premium, and exchange is\nsaid to be against England, and in favour of France. When you pay less,\nyou are supposed to get a premium, and exchange is said to be against\nFrance, and in favour of England.\nBut, first, We cannot always judge of the value of the current money of\ndifferent countries by the standard of their respective mints. In some it\nis more, in others it is less worn, clipt, and otherwise degenerated from\nthat standard. But the value of the current coin of every country,\ncompared with that of any other country, is in proportion, not to the\nquantity of pure silver which it ought to contain, but to that which it\nactually does contain. Before the reformation of the silver coin in King\nWilliam\u2019s time, exchange between England and Holland, computed in the\nusual manner, according to the standard of their respective mints, was\nfive-and twenty per cent. against England. But the value of the current\ncoin of England, as we learn from Mr Lowndes, was at that time rather more\nthan five-and-twenty per cent. below its standard value. The real\nexchange, therefore, may even at that time have been in favour of England,\nnotwithstanding the computed exchange was so much against it; a smaller\nnumber or ounces of pure silver, actually paid in England, may have\npurchased a bill for a greater number of ounces of pure silver to be paid\nin Holland, and the man who was supposed to give, may in reality have got\nthe premium. The French coin was, before the late reformation of the\nEnglish gold coin, much less wore than the English, and was perhaps two or\nthree per cent. nearer its standard. If the computed exchange with France,\ntherefore, was not more than two or three per cent. against England, the\nreal exchange might have been in its favour. Since the reformation of the\ngold coin, the exchange has been constantly in favour of England, and\nagainst France.\nSecondly, In some countries the expense of coinage is defrayed by the\ngovernment; in others, it is defrayed by the private people, who carry\ntheir bullion to the mint, and the government even derives some revenue\nfrom the coinage. In England it is defrayed by the government; and if you\ncarry a pound weight of standard silver to the mint, you get back\nsixty-two shillings, containing a pound weight of the like standard\nsilver. In France a duty of eight per cent. is deducted for the coinage,\nwhich not only defrays the expense of it, but affords a small revenue to\nthe government. In England, as the coinage costs nothing, the current coin\ncan never be much more valuable than the quantity of bullion which it\nactually contains. In France, the workmanship, as you pay for it, adds to\nthe value, in the same manner as to that of wrought plate. A sum of French\nmoney, therefore, containing an equal weight of pure silver, is more\nvaluable than a sum of English money containing an equal weight of pure\nsilver, and must require more bullion, or other commodities, to purchase\nit. Though the current coin of the two countries, therefore, were equally\nnear the standards of their respective mints, a sum of English money could\nnot well purchase a sum of French money containing an equal number of\nounces of pure silver, nor, consequently, a bill upon France for such a\nsum. If, for such a bill, no more additional money was paid than what was\nsufficient to compensate the expense of the French coinage, the real\nexchange might be at par between the two countries; their debts and\ncredits might mutually compensate one another, while the computed exchange\nwas considerably in favour of France. If less than this was paid, the real\nexchange might be in favour of England, while the computed was in favour\nof France.\nThirdly, and lastly, In some places, as at Amsterdam, Hamburg, Venice,\netc. foreign bills of exchange are paid in what they call bank money;\nwhile in others, as at London, Lisbon, Antwerp, Leghorn, etc. they are\npaid in the common currency of the country. What is called bank money, is\nalways of more value than the same nominal sum of common currency. A\nthousand guilders in the bank of Amsterdam, for example, are of more value\nthan a thousand guilders of Amsterdam currency. The difference between\nthem is called the agio of the bank, which at Amsterdam is generally about\nfive per cent. Supposing the current money of the two countries equally\nnear to the standard of their respective mints, and that the one pays\nforeign bills in this common currency, while the other pays them in bank\nmoney, it is evident that the computed exchange may be in favour of that\nwhich pays in bank money, though the real exchange should be in favour of\nthat which pays in current money; for the same reason that the computed\nexchange may be in favour of that which pays in better money, or in money\nnearer to its own standard, though the real exchange should be in favour\nof that which pays in worse. The computed exchange, before the late\nreformation of the gold coin, was generally against London with Amsterdam,\nHamburg, Venice, and, I believe, with all other places which pay in what\nis called bank money. It will by no means follow, however, that the real\nexchange was against it. Since the reformation of the gold coin, it has\nbeen in favour of London, even with those places. The computed exchange\nhas generally been in favour of London with Lisbon, Antwerp, Leghorn, and,\nif you except France, I believe with most other parts of Europe that pay\nin common currency; and it is not improbable that the real exchange was so\ntoo.\nDigression concerning Banks of Deposit, particularly concerning that of\nAmsterdam.\nThe currency of a great state, such as France or England, generally\nconsists almost entirely of its own coin. Should this currency, therefore,\nbe at any time worn, clipt, or otherwise degraded below its standard\nvalue, the state, by a reformation of its coin, can effectually\nre-establish its currency. But the currency of a small state, such as\nGenoa or Hamburg, can seldom consist altogether in its own coin, but must\nbe made up, in a great measure, of the coins of all the neighbouring\nstates with which its inhabitants have a continual intercourse. Such a\nstate, therefore, by reforming its coin, will not always be able to reform\nits currency. If foreign bills of exchange are paid in this currency, the\nuncertain value of any sum, of what is in its own nature so uncertain,\nmust render the exchange always very much against such a state, its\ncurrency being in all foreign states necessarily valued even below what it\nis worth.\nIn order to remedy the inconvenience to which this disadvantageous\nexchange must have subjected their merchants, such small states, when they\nbegan to attend to the interest of trade, have frequently enacted that\nforeign bills of exchange of a certain value should be paid, not in common\ncurrency, but by an order upon, or by a transfer in the books of a certain\nbank, established upon the credit, and under the protection of the state,\nthis bank being always obliged to pay, in good and true money, exactly\naccording to the standard of the state. The banks of Venice, Genoa,\nAmsterdam, Hamburg, and Nuremberg, seem to have been all originally\nestablished with this view, though some of them may have afterwards been\nmade subservient to other purposes. The money of such banks, being better\nthan the common currency of the country, necessarily bore an agio, which\nwas greater or smaller, according as the currency was supposed to be more\nor less degraded below the standard of the state. The agio of the bank of\nHamburg, for example, which is said to be commonly about fourteen per\ncent. is the supposed difference between the good standard money of the\nstate, and the clipt, worn, and diminished currency, poured into it from\nall the neighbouring states.\nBefore 1609, the great quantity of clipt and worn foreign coin which the\nextensive trade of Amsterdam brought from all parts of Europe, reduced the\nvalue of its currency about nine per cent. below that of good money fresh\nfrom the mint. Such money no sooner appeared, than it was melted down or\ncarried away, as it always is in such circumstances. The merchants, with\nplenty of currency, could not always find a sufficient quantity of good\nmoney to pay their bills of exchange; and the value of those bills, in\nspite of several regulations which were made to prevent it, became in a\ngreat measure uncertain.\nIn order to remedy these inconveniencies, a bank was established in 1609,\nunder the guarantee of the city. This bank received both foreign coin, and\nthe light and worn coin of the country, at its real intrinsic value in the\ngood standard money of the country, deducting only so much as was\nnecessary for defraying the expense of coinage and the other necessary\nexpense of management. For the value which remained after this small\ndeduction was made, it gave a credit in its books. This credit was called\nbank money, which, as it represented money exactly according to the\nstandard of the mint, was always of the same real value, and intrinsically\nworth more than current money. It was at the same time enacted, that all\nbills drawn upon or negotiated at Amsterdam, of the value of 600 guilders\nand upwards, should be paid in bank money, which at once took away all\nuncertainty in the value of those bills. Every merchant, in consequence of\nthis regulation, was obliged to keep an account with the bank, in order to\npay his foreign bills of exchange, which necessarily occasioned a certain\ndemand for bank money.\nBank money, over and above both its intrinsic superiority to currency, and\nthe additional value which this demand necessarily gives it, has likewise\nsome other advantages, It is secure from fire, robbery, and other\naccidents; the city of Amsterdam is bound for it; it can be paid away by a\nsimple transfer, without the trouble of counting, or the risk of\ntransporting it from one place to another. In consequence of those\ndifferent advantages, it seems from the beginning to have borne an agio;\nand it is generally believed that all the money originally deposited in\nthe bank, was allowed to remain there, nobody caring to demand payment of\na debt which he could sell for a premium in the market. By demanding\npayment of the bank, the owner of a bank credit would lose this premium.\nAs a shilling fresh from the mint will buy no more goods in the market\nthan one of our common worn shillings, so the good and true money which\nmight be brought from the coffers of the bank into those of a private\nperson, being mixed and confounded with the common currency of the\ncountry, would be of no more value than that currency, from which it could\nno longer be readily distinguished. While it remained in the coffers of\nthe bank, its superiority was known and ascertained. When it had come into\nthose of a private person, its superiority could not well be ascertained\nwithout more trouble than perhaps the difference was worth. By being\nbrought from the coffers of the bank, besides, it lost all the other\nadvantages of bank money; its security, its easy and safe transferability,\nits use in paying foreign bills of exchange. Over and above all this, it\ncould not be brought from those coffers, as will appear by and by, without\npreviously paying for the keeping.\nThose deposits of coin, or those deposits which the bank was bound to\nrestore in coin, constituted the original capital of the bank, or the\nwhole value of what was represented by what is called bank money. At\npresent they are supposed to constitute but a very small part of it. In\norder to facilitate the trade in bullion, the bank has been for these many\nyears in the practice of giving credit in its books, upon deposits of gold\nand silver bullion. This credit is generally about five per cent. below\nthe mint price of such bullion. The bank grants at the same time what is\ncalled a recipice or receipt, entitling the person who makes the deposit,\nor the bearer, to take out the bullion again at any time within six\nmonths, upon transferring to the bank a quantity of bank money equal to\nthat for which credit had been given in its books when the deposit was\nmade, and upon paying one-fourth per cent. for the keeping, if the deposit\nwas in silver; and one-half per cent. if it was in gold; but at the same\ntime declaring, that in default of such payment, and upon the expiration\nof this term, the deposit should belong to the bank, at the price at which\nit had been received, or for which credit had been given in the transfer\nbooks. What is thus paid for the keeping of the deposit may be considered\nas a sort of warehouse rent; and why this warehouse rent should be so much\ndearer for gold than for silver, several different reasons have been\nassigned. The fineness of gold, it has been said, is more difficult to be\nascertained than that of silver. Frauds are more easily practised, and\noccasion a greater loss in the most precious metal. Silver, besides, being\nthe standard metal, the state, it has been said, wishes to encourage more\nthe making of deposits of silver than those of gold.\nDeposits of bullion are most commonly made when the price is somewhat\nlower than ordinary, and they are taken out again when it happens to rise.\nIn Holland the market price of bullion is generally above the mint price,\nfor the same reason that it was so in England before the late reformation\nof the gold coin. The difference is said to be commonly from about six to\nsixteen stivers upon the mark, or eight ounces of silver, of eleven parts\nof fine and one part alloy. The bank price, or the credit which the bank\ngives for the deposits of such silver (when made in foreign coin, of which\nthe fineness is well known and ascertained, such as Mexico dollars), is\ntwenty-two guilders the mark: the mint price is about twenty-three\nguilders, and the market price is from twenty-three guilders six, to\ntwenty-three guilders sixteen stivers, or from two to three per cent.\nabove the mint price.\nThe following are the prices at which the bank of Amsterdam at present\n{September 1775} receives bullion and coin of different kinds:\nSILVER\nMexico dollars .................  22  Guilders / mark\nFrench crowns ..................  22\nEnglish silver coin.............  22\nMexico dollars, new coin........  21  10\nDucatoons.......................   3   0\nRix-dollars.....................   2   8\nBar silver, containing 11-12ths fine silver, 21 Guilders / mark, and in\nthis proportion down to 1-4th fine, on which 5 guilders are given. Fine\nbars,................. 28 Guilders / mark.\nGOLD\nPortugal coin.................  310  Guilders / mark\nGuineas.......................  310\nLouis d\u2019ors, new..............  310\nDitto        old..............  300\nNew ducats....................    4  19  8  per ducat\nBar or ingot gold is received in proportion to its fineness, compared with\nthe above foreign gold coin. Upon fine bars the bank gives 340 per mark.\nIn general, however, something more is given upon coin of a known\nfineness, than upon gold and silver bars, of which the fineness cannot be\nascertained but by a process of melting and assaying.\nThe proportions between the bank price, the mint price, and the market\nprice of gold bullion, are nearly the same. A person can generally sell\nhis receipt for the difference between the mint price of bullion and the\nmarket price. A receipt for bullion is almost always worth something, and\nit very seldom happens, therefore, that anybody suffers his receipts to\nexpire, or allows his bullion to fall to the bank at the price at which it\nhad been received, either by not taking it out before the end of the six\nmonths, or by neglecting to pay one fourth or one half per cent. in order\nto obtain a new receipt for another six months. This, however, though it\nhappens seldom, is said to happen sometimes, and more frequently with\nregard to gold than with regard to silver, on account of the higher\nwarehouse rent which is paid for the keeping of the more precious metal.\nThe person who, by making a deposit of bullion, obtains both a bank credit\nand a receipt, pays his bills of exchange as they become due, with his\nbank credit; and either sells or keeps his receipt, according as he judges\nthat the price of bullion is likely to rise or to fall. The receipt and\nthe bank credit seldom keep long together, and there is no occasion that\nthey should. The person who has a receipt, and who wants to take out\nbullion, finds always plenty of bank credits, or bank money, to buy at the\nordinary price, and the person who has bank money, and wants to take out\nbullion, finds receipts always in equal abundance.\nThe owners of bank credits, and the holders of receipts, constitute two\ndifferent sorts of creditors against the bank. The holder of a receipt\ncannot draw out the bullion for which it is granted, without re-assigning\nto the bank a sum of bank money equal to the price at which the bullion\nhad been received. If he has no bank money of his own, he must purchase it\nof those who have it. The owner of bank money cannot draw out bullion,\nwithout producing to the bank receipts for the quantity which he wants. If\nhe has none of his own, he must buy them of those who have them. The\nholder of a receipt, when he purchases bank money, purchases the power of\ntaking out a quantity of bullion, of which the mint price is five per\ncent. above the bank price. The agio of five per cent. therefore, which he\ncommonly pays for it, is paid, not for an imaginary, but for a real value.\nThe owner of bank money, when he purchases a receipt, purchases the power\nof taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the market price is commonly\nfrom two to three per cent. above the mint price. The price which he pays\nfor it, therefore, is paid likewise for a real value. The price of the\nreceipt, and the price of the bank money, compound or make up between them\nthe full value or price of the bullion.\nUpon deposits of the coin current in the country, the bank grant receipts\nlikewise, as well as bank credits; but those receipts are frequently of no\nvalue and will bring no price in the market. Upon ducatoons, for example,\nwhich in the currency pass for three guilders three stivers each, the bank\ngives a credit of three guilders only, or five per cent. below their\ncurrent value. It grants a receipt likewise, entitling the bearer to take\nout the number of ducatoons deposited at any time within six months, upon\npaying one fourth per cent. for the keeping. This receipt will frequently\nbring no price in the market. Three guilders, bank money, generally sell\nin the market for three guilders three stivers, the full value of the\nducatoons, if they were taken out of the bank; and before they can be\ntaken out, one-fourth per cent. must be paid for the keeping, which would\nbe mere loss to the holder of the receipt. If the agio of the bank,\nhowever, should at any time fall to three per cent. such receipts might\nbring some price in the market, and might sell for one and three-fourths\nper cent. But the agio of the bank being now generally about five per\ncent. such receipts are frequently allowed to expire, or, as they express\nit, to fall to the bank. The receipts which are given for deposits of gold\nducats fall to it yet more frequently, because a higher warehouse rent, or\none half per cent. must be paid for the keeping of them, before they can\nbe taken out again. The five per cent. which the bank gains, when deposits\neither of coin or bullion are allowed to fall to it, maybe considered as\nthe warehouse rent for the perpetual keeping of such deposits.\nThe sum of bank money, for which the receipts are expired, must be very\nconsiderable. It must comprehend the whole original capital of the bank,\nwhich, it is generally supposed, has been allowed to remain there from the\ntime it was first deposited, nobody caring either to renew his receipt, or\nto take out his deposit, as, for the reasons already assigned, neither the\none nor the other could be done without loss. But whatever may be the\namount of this sum, the proportion which it bears to the whole mass of\nbank money is supposed to be very small. The bank of Amsterdam has, for\nthese many years past, been the great warehouse of Europe for bullion, for\nwhich the receipts are very seldom allowed to expire, or, as they express\nit, to fall to the bank. The far greater part of the bank money, or of the\ncredits upon the books of the bank, is supposed to have been created, for\nthese many years past, by such deposits, which the dealers in bullion are\ncontinually both making and withdrawing.\nNo demand can be made upon the bank, but by means of a recipice or\nreceipt. The smaller mass of bank money, for which the receipts are\nexpired, is mixed and confounded with the much greater mass for which they\nare still in force; so that, though there may be a considerable sum of\nbank money, for which there are no receipts, there is no specific sum or\nportion of it which may not at any time be demanded by one. The bank\ncannot be debtor to two persons for the same thing; and the owner of bank\nmoney who has no receipt, cannot demand payment of the bank till he buys\none. In ordinary and quiet times, he can find no difficulty in getting one\nto buy at the market price, which generally corresponds with the price at\nwhich he can sell the coin or bullion it entitles him to take out of the\nbank.\nIt might be otherwise during a public calamity; an invasion, for example,\nsuch as that of the French in 1672. The owners of bank money being then\nall eager to draw it out of the bank, in order to have it in their own\nkeeping, the demand for receipts might raise their price to an exorbitant\nheight. The holders of them might form extravagant expectations, and,\ninstead of two or three per cent. demand half the bank money for which\ncredit had been given upon the deposits that the receipts had respectively\nbeen granted for. The enemy, informed of the constitution of the bank,\nmight even buy them up, in order to prevent the carrying away of the\ntreasure. In such emergencies, the bank, it is supposed, would break\nthrough its ordinary rule of making payment only to the holders of\nreceipts. The holders of receipts, who had no bank money, must have\nreceived within two or three per cent. of the value of the deposit for\nwhich their respective receipts had been granted. The bank, therefore, it\nis said, would in this case make no scruple of paying, either with money\nor bullion, the full value of what the owners of bank money, who could get\nno receipts, were credited for in its books; paying, at the same time, two\nor three per cent. to such holders of receipts as had no bank money, that\nbeing the whole value which, in this state of things, could justly be\nsupposed due to them.\nEven in ordinary and quiet times, it is the interest of the holders of\nreceipts to depress the agio, in order either to buy bank money (and\nconsequently the bullion which their receipts would then enable them to\ntake out of the bank ) so much cheaper, or to sell their receipts to those\nwho have bank money, and who want to take out bullion, so much dearer; the\nprice of a receipt being generally equal to the difference between the\nmarket price of bank money and that of the coin or bullion for which the\nreceipt had been granted. It is the interest of the owners of bank money,\non the contrary, to raise the agio, in order either to sell their bank\nmoney so much dearer, or to buy a receipt so much cheaper. To prevent the\nstock-jobbing tricks which those opposite interests might sometimes\noccasion, the bank has of late years come to the resolution, to sell at\nall times bank money for currency at five per cent. agio, and to buy it in\nagain at four per cent. agio. In consequence of this resolution, the agio\ncan never either rise above five, or sink below four per cent.; and the\nproportion between the market price of bank and that of current money is\nkept at all times very near the proportion between their intrinsic values.\nBefore this resolution was taken, the market price of bank money used\nsometimes to rise so high as nine per cent. agio, and sometimes to sink so\nlow as par, according as opposite interests happened to influence the\nmarket.\nThe bank of Amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is deposited\nwith it, but for every guilder for which it gives credit in its books, to\nkeep in its repositories the value of a guilder either in money or\nbullion. That it keeps in its repositories all the money or bullion for\nwhich there are receipts in force for which it is at all times liable to\nbe called upon, and which in reality is continually going from it, and\nreturning to it again, cannot well be doubted. But whether it does so\nlikewise with regard to that part of its capital for which the receipts\nare long ago expired, for which, in ordinary and quiet times, it cannot be\ncalled upon, and which, in reality, is very likely to remain with it for\never, or as long as the states of the United Provinces subsist, may\nperhaps appear more uncertain. At Amsterdam, however, no point of faith is\nbetter established than that, for every guilder circulated as bank money,\nthere is a correspondent guilder in gold or silver to be found in the\ntreasures of the bank. The city is guarantee that it should be so. The\nbank is under the direction of the four reigning burgomasters who are\nchanged every year. Each new set of burgomasters visits the treasure,\ncompares it with the books, receives it upon oath, and delivers it over,\nwith the same awful solemnity to the set which succeeds; and in that sober\nand religious country, oaths are not yet disregarded. A rotation of this\nkind seems alone a sufficient security against any practices which cannot\nbe avowed. Amidst all the revolutions which faction has ever occasioned in\nthe government of Amsterdam, the prevailing party has at no time accused\ntheir predecessors of infidelity in the administration of the bank. No\naccusation could have affected more deeply the reputation and fortune of\nthe disgraced party; and if such an accusation could have been supported,\nwe may be assured that it would have been brought. In 1672, when the\nFrench king was at Utrecht, the bank of Amsterdam paid so readily, as left\nno doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its engagements. Some\nof the pieces which were then brought from its repositories, appeared to\nhave been scorched with the fire which happened in the town-house soon\nafter the bank was established. Those pieces, therefore, must have lain\nthere from that time.\nWhat may be the amount of the treasure in the bank, is a question which\nhas long employed the speculations of the curious. Nothing but conjecture\ncan be offered concerning it. It is generally reckoned, that there are\nabout 2000 people who keep accounts with the bank; and allowing them to\nhave, one with another, the value of \u00a31500 sterling lying upon their\nrespective accounts (a very large allowance), the whole quantity of bank\nmoney, and consequently of treasure in the bank, will amount to about\n\u00a33,000,000 sterling, or, at eleven guilders the pound sterling, 33,000,000\nof guilders; a great sum, and sufficient to carry on a very extensive\ncirculation, but vastly below the extravagant ideas which some people have\nformed of this treasure.\nThe city of Amsterdam derives a considerable revenue from the bank.\nBesides what may be called the warehouse rent above mentioned, each\nperson, upon first opening an account with the bank, pays a fee of ten\nguilders; and for every new account, three guilders three stivers; for\nevery transfer, two stivers; and if the transfer is for less than 300\nguilders, six stivers, in order to discourage the multiplicity of small\ntransactions. The person who neglects to balance his account twice in the\nyear, forfeits twenty-five guilders. The person who orders a transfer for\nmore than is upon his account, is obliged to pay three per cent. for the\nsum overdrawn, and his order is set aside into the bargain. The bank is\nsupposed, too, to make a considerable profit by the sale of the foreign\ncoin or bullion which sometimes falls to it by the expiring of receipts,\nand which is always kept till it can be sold with advantage. It makes a\nprofit, likewise, by selling bank money at five per cent. agio, and buying\nit in at four. These different emoluments amount to a good deal more than\nwhat is necessary for paying the salaries of officers, and defraying the\nexpense of management. What is paid for the keeping of bullion upon\nreceipts, is alone supposed to amount to a neat annual revenue of between\n150,000 and 200,000 guilders. Public utility, however, and not revenue,\nwas the original object of this institution. Its object was to relieve the\nmerchants from the inconvenience of a disadvantageous exchange. The\nrevenue which has arisen from it was unforeseen, and may be considered as\naccidental. But it is now time to return from this long digression, into\nwhich I have been insensibly led, in endeavouring to explain the reasons\nwhy the exchange between the countries which pay in what is called bank\nmoney, and those which pay in common currency, should generally appear to\nbe in favour of the former, and against the latter. The former pay in a\nspecies of money, of which the intrinsic value is always the same, and\nexactly agreeable to the standard of their respective mints; the latter is\na species of money, of which the intrinsic value is continually varying,\nand is almost always more or less below that standard.\nPART II.\u2014Of the Unreasonableness of those extraordinary Restraints,\nupon other Principles.\nIn the foregoing part of this chapter, I have endeavoured to show, even\nupon the principles of the commercial system, how unnecessary it is to lay\nextraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those\ncountries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be\ndisadvantageous.\nNothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the\nbalance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all\nthe other regulations of commerce, are founded. When two places trade with\none another, this doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither\nof them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side,\nthat one of them loses, and the other gains, in proportion to its\ndeclension from the exact equilibrium. Both suppositions are false. A\ntrade, which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies, may be, and\ncommonly is, disadvantageous to the country in whose favour it is meant to\nbe established, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter. But that trade\nwhich, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on\nbetween any two places, is always advantageous, though not always equally\nso, to both.\nBy advantage or gain, I understand, not the increase of the quantity of\ngold and silver, but that of the exchangeable value of the annual produce\nof the land and labour of the country, or the increase of the annual\nrevenue of its inhabitants.\nIf the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places consist\naltogether in the exchange of their native commodities, they will, upon\nmost occasions, not only both gain, but they will gain equally, or very\nnearly equally; each will, in this case, afford a market for a part of the\nsurplus produce of the other; each will replace a capital which had been\nemployed in raising and preparing for the market this part of the surplus\nproduce of the other, and which had been distributed among, and given\nrevenue and maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants. Some part\nof the inhabitants of each, therefore, will directly derive their revenue\nand maintenance from the other. As the commodities exchanged, too, are\nsupposed to be of equal value, so the two capitals employed in the trade\nwill, upon most occasions, be equal, or very nearly equal; and both being\nemployed in raising the native commodities of the two countries, the\nrevenue and maintenance which their distribution will afford to the\ninhabitants of each will be equal, or very nearly equal. This revenue and\nmaintenance, thus mutually afforded, will be greater or smaller, in\nproportion to the extent of their dealings. If these should annually\namount to \u00a3100,000, for example, or to \u00a31,000,000, on each side, each of\nthem will afford an annual revenue, in the one case, of \u00a3100,000, and, in\nthe other, of \u00a31,000,000, to the inhabitants of the other.\nIf their trade should be of such a nature, that one of them exported to\nthe other nothing but native commodities, while the returns of that other\nconsisted altogether in foreign goods; the balance, in this case, would\nstill be supposed even, commodities being paid for with commodities. They\nwould, in this case too, both gain, but they would not gain equally; and\nthe inhabitants of the country which exported nothing but native\ncommodities, would derive the greatest revenue from the trade. If England,\nfor example, should import from France nothing but the native commodities\nof that country, and not having such commodities of its own as were in\ndemand there, should annually repay them by sending thither a large\nquantity of foreign goods, tobacco, we shall suppose, and East India\ngoods; this trade, though it would give some revenue to the inhabitants of\nboth countries, would give more to those of France than to those of\nEngland. The whole French capital annually employed in it would annually\nbe distributed among the people of France; but that part of the English\ncapital only, which was employed in producing the English commodities with\nwhich those foreign goods were purchased, would be annually distributed\namong the people of England. The greater part of it would replace the\ncapitals which had been employed in Virginia, Indostan, and China, and\nwhich had given revenue and maintenance to the inhabitants of those\ndistant countries. If the capitals were equal, or nearly equal, therefore,\nthis employment of the French capital would augment much more the revenue\nof the people of France, than that of the English capital would the\nrevenue of the people of England. France would, in this case, carry on a\ndirect foreign trade of consumption with England; whereas England would\ncarry on a round-about trade of the same kind with France. The different\neffects of a capital employed in the direct, and of one employed in the\nround-about foreign trade of consumption, have already been fully\nexplained.\nThere is not, probably, between any two countries, a trade which consists\naltogether in the exchange, either of native commodities on both sides, or\nof native commodities on one side, and of foreign goods on the other.\nAlmost all countries exchange with one another, partly native and partly\nforeign goods. That country, however, in whose cargoes there is the\ngreatest proportion of native, and the least of foreign goods, will always\nbe the principal gainer.\nIf it was not with tobacco and East India goods, but with gold and silver,\nthat England paid for the commodities annually imported from France, the\nbalance, in this case, would be supposed uneven, commodities not being\npaid for with commodities, but with gold and silver. The trade, however,\nwould in this case, as in the foregoing, give some revenue to the\ninhabitants of both countries, but more to those of France than to those\nof England. It would give some revenue to those of England. The capital\nwhich had been employed in producing the English goods that purchased this\ngold and silver, the capital which had been distributed among, and given\nrevenue to, certain inhabitants of England, would thereby be replaced, and\nenabled to continue that employment. The whole capital of England would no\nmore be diminished by this exportation of gold and silver, than by the\nexportation of an equal value of any other goods. On the contrary, it\nwould, in most cases, be augmented. No goods are sent abroad but those for\nwhich the demand is supposed to be greater abroad than at home, and of\nwhich the returns, consequently, it is expected, will be of more value at\nhome than the commodities exported. If the tobacco which in England is\nworth only \u00a3100,000, when sent to France, will purchase wine which is in\nEngland worth \u00a3110,000, the exchange will augment the capital of England\nby \u00a310,000. If \u00a3100,000 of English gold, in the same manner, purchase\nFrench wine, which in England is worth \u00a3110,000, this exchange will\nequally augment the capital of England by \u00a310,000. As a merchant, who has\n\u00a3110,000 worth of wine in his cellar, is a richer man than he who has only\n\u00a3100,000 worth of tobacco in his warehouse, so is he likewise a richer man\nthan he who has only \u00a3100,000 worth of gold in his coffers. He can put\ninto motion a greater quantity of industry, and give revenue, maintenance,\nand employment, to a greater number of people, than either of the other\ntwo. But the capital of the country is equal to the capital of all its\ndifferent inhabitants; and the quantity of industry which can be annually\nmaintained in it is equal to what all those different capitals can\nmaintain. Both the capital of the country, therefore, and the quantity of\nindustry which can be annually maintained in it, must generally be\naugmented by this exchange. It would, indeed, be more advantageous for\nEngland that it could purchase the wines of France with its own hardware\nand broad cloth, than with either the tobacco of Virginia, or the gold and\nsilver of Brazil and Peru. A direct foreign trade of consumption is always\nmore advantageous than a round-about one. But a round-about foreign trade\nof consumption, which is carried on with gold and silver, does not seem to\nbe less advantageous than any other equally round-about one. Neither is a\ncountry which has no mines, more likely to be exhausted of gold and silver\nby this annual exportation of those metals, than one which does not grow\ntobacco by the like annual exportation of that plant. As a country which\nhas wherewithal to buy tobacco will never be long in want of it, so\nneither will one be long in want of gold and silver which has wherewithal\nto purchase those metals.\nIt is a losing trade, it is said, which a workman carries on with the\nalehouse; and the trade which a manufacturing nation would naturally carry\non with a wine country, may be considered as a trade of the same nature. I\nanswer, that the trade with the alehouse is not necessarily a losing\ntrade. In its own nature it is just as advantageous as any other, though,\nperhaps, somewhat more liable to be abused. The employment of a brewer,\nand even that of a retailer of fermented liquors, are as necessary\ndivisions of labour as any other. It will generally be more advantageous\nfor a workman to buy of the brewer the quantity he has occasion for, than\nto brew it himself; and if he is a poor workman, it will generally be more\nadvantageous for him to buy it by little and little of the retailer, than\na large quantity of the brewer. He may no doubt buy too much of either, as\nhe may of any other dealers in his neighbourhood; of the butcher, if he is\na glutton; or of the draper, if he affects to be a beau among his\ncompanions. It is advantageous to the great body of workmen,\nnotwithstanding, that all these trades should be free, though this freedom\nmay be abused in all of them, and is more likely to be so, perhaps, in\nsome than in others. Though individuals, besides, may sometimes ruin their\nfortunes by an excessive consumption of fermented liquors, there seems to\nbe no risk that a nation should do so. Though in every country there are\nmany people who spend upon such liquors more than they can afford, there\nare always many more who spend less. It deserves to be remarked, too, that\nif we consult experience, the cheapness of wine seems to be a cause, not\nof drunkenness, but of sobriety. The inhabitants of the wine countries are\nin general the soberest people of Europe; witness the Spaniards, the\nItalians, and the inhabitants of the southern provinces of France. People\nare seldom guilty of excess in what is their daily fare. Nobody affects\nthe character of liberality and good fellowship, by being profuse of a\nliquor which is as cheap as small beer. On the contrary, in the countries\nwhich, either from excessive heat or cold, produce no grapes, and where\nwine consequently is dear and a rarity, drunkenness is a common vice, as\namong the northern nations, and all those who live between the tropics,\nthe negroes, for example on the coast of Guinea. When a French regiment\ncomes from some of the northern provinces of France, where wine is\nsomewhat dear, to be quartered in the southern, where it is very cheap,\nthe soldiers, I have frequently heard it observed, are at first debauched\nby the cheapness and novelty of good wine; but after a few months\nresidence, the greater part of them become as sober as the rest of the\ninhabitants. Were the duties upon foreign wines, and the excises upon\nmalt, beer, and ale, to be taken away all at once, it might, in the same\nmanner, occasion in Great Britain a pretty general and temporary\ndrunkenness among the middling and inferior ranks of people, which would\nprobably be soon followed by a permanent and almost universal sobriety. At\npresent, drunkenness is by no means the vice of people of fashion, or of\nthose who can easily afford the most expensive liquors. A gentleman drunk\nwith ale has scarce ever been seen among us. The restraints upon the wine\ntrade in Great Britain, besides, do not so much seem calculated to hinder\nthe people from going, if I may say so, to the alehouse, as from going\nwhere they can buy the best and cheapest liquor. They favour the wine\ntrade of Portugal, and discourage that of France. The Portuguese, it is\nsaid, indeed, are better customers for our manufactures than the French,\nand should therefore be encouraged in preference to them. As they give us\ntheir custom, it is pretended we should give them ours. The sneaking arts\nof underling tradesmen are thus erected into political maxims for the\nconduct of a great empire; for it is the most underling tradesmen only who\nmake it a rule to employ chiefly their own customers. A great trader\npurchases his goods always where they are cheapest and best, without\nregard to any little interest of this kind.\nBy such maxims as these, however, nations have been taught that their\ninterest consisted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each nation has been\nmade to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations\nwith which it trades, and to consider their gain as its own loss.\nCommerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations as among individuals,\na bond of union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of\ndiscord and animosity. The capricious ambition of kings and ministers has\nnot, during the present and the preceding century, been more fatal to the\nrepose of Europe, than the impertinent jealousy of merchants and\nmanufacturers. The violence and injustice of the rulers of mankind is an\nancient evil, for which, I am afraid, the nature of human affairs can\nscarce admit of a remedy: but the mean rapacity, the monopolizing spirit,\nof merchants and manufacturers, who neither are, nor ought to be, the\nrulers of mankind, though it cannot, perhaps, be corrected, may very\neasily be prevented from disturbing the tranquillity of anybody but\nthemselves.\nThat it was the spirit of monopoly which originally both invented and\npropagated this doctrine, cannot be doubted and they who first taught it,\nwere by no means such fools as they who believed it. In every country it\nalways is, and must be, the interest of the great body of the people, to\nbuy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest. The proposition is\nso very manifest, that it seems ridiculous to take any pains to prove it;\nnor could it ever have been called in question, had not the interested\nsophistry of merchants and manufacturers confounded the common sense of\nmankind. Their interest is, in this respect, directly opposite to that of\nthe great body of the people. As it is the interest of the freemen of a\ncorporation to hinder the rest of the inhabitants from employing any\nworkmen but themselves; so it is the interest of the merchants and\nmanufacturers of every country to secure to themselves the monopoly of the\nhome market. Hence, in Great Britain, and in most other European\ncountries, the extraordinary duties upon almost all goods imported by\nalien merchants. Hence the high duties and prohibitions upon all those\nforeign manufactures which can come into competition with our own. Hence,\ntoo, the extraordinary restraints upon the importation of almost all sorts\nof goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed\nto be disadvantageous; that is, from those against whom national animosity\nhappens ta be most violently inflamed.\nThe wealth of neighbouring nations, however, though dangerous in war and\npolitics, is certainly advantageous in trade. In a state of hostility, it\nmay enable our enemies to maintain fleets and armies superior to our own;\nbut in a state of peace and commerce it must likewise enable them to\nexchange with us to a greater value, and to afford a better market, either\nfor the immediate produce of our own industry, or for whatever is\npurchased with that produce. As a rich man is likely to be a better\ncustomer to the industrious people in his neighbourhood, than a poor, so\nis likewise a rich nation. A rich man, indeed, who is himself a\nmanufacturer, is a very dangerous neighbour to all those who deal in the\nsame way. All the rest of the neighbourhood, however, by far the greatest\nnumber, profit by the good market which his expense affords them. They\neven profit by his underselling the poorer workmen who deal in the same\nway with him. The manufacturers of a rich nation, in the same manner, may\nno doubt be very dangerous rivals to those of their neighbours. This very\ncompetition, however, is advantageous to the great body of the people, who\nprofit greatly, besides, by the good market which the great expense of\nsuch a nation affords them in every other way. Private people, who want to\nmake a fortune, never think of retiring to the remote and poor provinces\nof the country, but resort either to the capital, or to some of the great\ncommercial towns. They know, that where little wealth circulates, there is\nlittle to be got; but that where a great deal is in motion, some share of\nit may fall to them. The same maxim which would in this manner direct the\ncommon sense of one, or ten, or twenty individuals, should regulate the\njudgment of one, or ten, or twenty millions, and should make a whole\nnation regard the riches of its neighbours, as a probable cause and\noccasion for itself to acquire riches. A nation that would enrich itself\nby foreign trade, is certainly most likely to do so, when its neighbours\nare all rich, industrious and commercial nations. A great nation,\nsurrounded on all sides by wandering savages and poor barbarians, might,\nno doubt, acquire riches by the cultivation of its own lands, and by its\nown interior commerce, but not by foreign trade. It seems to have been in\nthis manner that the ancient Egyptians and the modern Chinese acquired\ntheir great wealth. The ancient Egyptians, it is said, neglected foreign\ncommerce, and the modern Chinese, it is known, hold it in the utmost\ncontempt, and scarce deign to afford it the decent protection of the laws.\nThe modern maxims of foreign commerce, by aiming at the impoverishment of\nall our neighbours, so far as they are capable of producing their intended\neffect, tend to render that very commerce insignificant and contemptible.\nIt is in consequence of these maxims, that the commerce between France and\nEngland has, in both countries, been subjected to so many discouragements\nand restraints. If those two countries, however, were to consider their\nreal interest, without either mercantile jealousy or national animosity,\nthe commerce of France might be more advantageous to Great Britain than\nthat of any other country, and, for the same reason, that of Great Britain\nto France. France is the nearest neighbour to Great Britain. In the trade\nbetween the southern coast of England and the northern and north-western\ncoast of France, the returns might be expected, in the same manner as in\nthe inland trade, four, five, or six times in the year. The capital,\ntherefore, employed in this trade could, in each of the two countries,\nkeep in motion four, five, or six times the quantity of industry, and\nafford employment and subsistence to four, five, or six times the number\nof people, which all equal capital could do in the greater part of the\nother branches of foreign trade. Between the parts of France and Great\nBritain most remote from one another, the returns might be expected, at\nleast, once in the year; and even this trade would so far be at least\nequally advantageous, as the greater part of the other branches of our\nforeign European trade. It would be, at least, three times more\nadvantageous than the boasted trade with our North American colonies, in\nwhich the returns were seldom made in less than three years, frequently\nnot in less than four or five years. France, besides, is supposed to\ncontain 24,000,000 of inhabitants. Our North American colonies were never\nsupposed to contain more than 3,000,000; and France is a much richer\ncountry than North America; though, on account of the more unequal\ndistribution of riches, there is much more poverty and beggary in the one\ncountry than in the other. France, therefore, could afford a market at\nleast eight times more extensive, and, on account of the superior\nfrequency of the returns, four-and-twenty times more advantageous than\nthat which our North American colonies ever afforded. The trade of Great\nBritain would be just as advantageous to France, and, in proportion to the\nwealth, population, and proximity of the respective countries, would have\nthe same superiority over that which France carries on with her own\ncolonies. Such is the very great difference between that trade which the\nwisdom of both nations has thought proper to discourage, and that which it\nhas favoured the most.\nBut the very same circumstances which would have rendered an open and free\ncommerce between the two countries so advantageous to both, have\noccasioned the principal obstructions to that commerce. Being neighbours,\nthey are necessarily enemies, and the wealth and power of each becomes,\nupon that account, more formidable to the other; and what would increase\nthe advantage of national friendship, serves only to inflame the violence\nof national animosity. They are both rich and industrious nations; and the\nmerchants and manufacturers of each dread the competition of the skill and\nactivity of those of the other. Mercantile jealousy is excited, and both\ninflames, and is itself inflamed, by the violence of national animosity,\nand the traders of both countries have announced, with all the passionate\nconfidence of interested falsehood, the certain ruin of each, in\nconsequence of that unfavourable balance of trade, which, they pretend,\nwould be the infallible effect of an unrestrained commerce with the other.\nThere is no commercial country in Europe, of which the approaching ruin\nhas not frequently been foretold by the pretended doctors of this system,\nfrom all unfavourably balance of trade. After all the anxiety, however,\nwhich they have excited about this, after all the vain attempts of almost\nall trading nations to turn that balance in their own favour, and against\ntheir neighbours, it does not appear that any one nation in Europe has\nbeen, in any respect, impoverished by this cause. Every town and country,\non the contrary, in proportion as they have opened their ports to all\nnations, instead of being ruined by this free trade, as the principles of\nthe commercial system would lead us to expect, have been enriched by it.\nThough there are in Europe indeed, a few towns which, in same respects,\ndeserve the name of free ports, there is no country which does so.\nHolland, perhaps, approaches the nearest to this character of any, though\nstill very remote from it; and Holland, it is acknowledged, not only\nderives its whole wealth, but a great part of its necessary subsistence,\nfrom foreign trade.\nThere is another balance, indeed, which has already been explained, very\ndifferent from the balance of trade, and which, according as it happens to\nbe either favourable or unfavourable, necessarily occasions the prosperity\nor decay of every nation. This is the balance of the annual produce and\nconsumption. If the exchangeable value of the annual produce, it has\nalready been observed, exceeds that of the annual consumption, the capital\nof the society must annually increase in proportion to this excess. The\nsociety in this case lives within its revenue; and what is annually saved\nout of its revenue, is naturally added to its capital, and employed so as\nto increase still further the annual produce. If the exchangeable value of\nthe annual produce, on the contrary, fall short of the annual consumption,\nthe capital of the society must annually decay in proportion to this\ndeficiency. The expense of the society, in this case, exceeds its revenue,\nand necessarily encroaches upon its capital. Its capital, therefore, must\nnecessarily decay, and, together with it, the exchangeable value of the\nannual produce of its industry.\nThis balance of produce and consumption is entirely different from what is\ncalled the balance of trade. It might take place in a nation which had no\nforeign trade, but which was entirely separated from all the world. It may\ntake place in the whole globe of the earth, of which the wealth,\npopulation, and improvement, may be either gradually increasing or\ngradually decaying.\nThe balance of produce and consumption may be constantly in favour of a\nnation, though what is called the balance of trade be generally against\nit. A nation may import to a greater value than it exports for half a\ncentury, perhaps, together; the gold and silver which comes into it during\nall this time, may be all immediately sent out of it; its circulating coin\nmay gradually decay, different sorts of paper money being substituted in\nits place, and even the debts, too, which it contracts in the principal\nnations with whom it deals, may be gradually increasing; and yet its real\nwealth, the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its lands and\nlabour, may, during the same period, have been increasing in a much\ngreater proportion. The state of our North American colonies, and of the\ntrade which they carried on with Great Britain, before the commencement of\nthe present disturbances, {This paragraph was written in the year 1775.}\nmay serve as a proof that this is by no means an impossible supposition.\nCHAPTER IV.\nOF DRAWBACKS.\nMerchants and manufacturers are not contented with the monopoly of the\nhome market, but desire likewise the most extensive foreign sale for their\ngoods. Their country has no jurisdiction in foreign nations, and therefore\ncan seldom procure them any monopoly there. They are generally obliged,\ntherefore, to content themselves with petitioning for certain\nencouragements to exportation.\nOf these encouragements, what are called drawbacks seem to be the most\nreasonable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation, either\nthe whole, or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed upon\ndomestic industry, can never occasion the exportation of a greater\nquantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been\nimposed. Such encouragements do not tend to turn towards any particular\nemployment a greater share of the capital of the country, than what would\ngo to that employment of its own accord, but only to hinder the duty from\ndriving away any part of that share to other employments. They tend not to\noverturn that balance which naturally establishes itself among all the\nvarious employments of the society, but to hinder it from being overturned\nby the duty. They tend not to destroy, but to preserve, what it is in most\ncases advantageous to preserve, the natural division and distribution of\nlabour in the society.\nThe same thing may be said of the drawbacks upon the re-exportation of\nforeign goods imported, which, in Great Britain, generally amount to by\nmuch the largest part of the duty upon importation. By the second of the\nrules, annexed to the act of parliament, which imposed what is now called\nthe old subsidy, every merchant, whether English or alien. was allowed to\ndraw back half that duty upon exportation; the English merchant, provided\nthe exportation took place within twelve months; the alien, provided it\ntook place within nine months. Wines, currants, and wrought silks, were\nthe only goods which did not fall within this rule, having other and more\nadvantageous allowances. The duties imposed by this act of parliament\nwere, at that time, the only duties upon the importation of foreign goods.\nThe term within which this, and all other drawbacks could be claimed, was\nafterwards (by 7 Geo. I. chap. 21. sect. 10.) extended to three years.\nThe duties which have been imposed since the old subsidy, are, the greater\npart of them, wholly drawn back upon exportation. This general rule,\nhowever, is liable to a great number of exceptions; and the doctrine of\ndrawbacks has become a much less simple matter than it was at their first\ninstitution.\nUpon the exportation of some foreign goods, of which it was expected that\nthe importation would greatly exceed what was necessary for the home\nconsumption, the whole duties are drawn back, without retaining even half\nthe old subsidy. Before the revolt of our North American colonies, we had\nthe monopoly of the tobacco of Maryland and Virginia. We imported about\nninety-six thousand hogsheads, and the home consumption was not supposed\nto exceed fourteen thousand. To facilitate the great exportation which was\nnecessary, in order to rid us of the rest, the whole duties were drawn\nback, provided the exportation took place within three years.\nWe still have, though not altogether, yet very nearly, the monopoly of the\nsugars of our West Indian islands. If sugars are exported within a year,\ntherefore, all the duties upon importation are drawn back; and if exported\nwithin three years, all the duties, except half the old subsidy, which\nstill continues to be retained upon the exportation of the greater part of\ngoods. Though the importation of sugar exceeds a good deal what is\nnecessary for the home consumption, the excess is inconsiderable, in\ncomparison of what it used to be in tobacco.\nSome goods, the particular objects of the jealousy of our own\nmanufacturers, are prohibited to be imported for home consumption. They\nmay, however, upon paying certain duties, be imported and warehoused for\nexportation. But upon such exportation no part of these duties is drawn\nback. Our manufacturers are unwilling, it seems, that even this restricted\nimportation should be encouraged, and are afraid lest some part of these\ngoods should be stolen out of the warehouse, and thus come into\ncompetition with their own. It is under these regulations only that we can\nimport wrought silks, French cambrics and lawns, calicoes, painted,\nprinted, stained, or dyed, etc.\nWe are unwilling even to be the carriers of French goods, and choose\nrather to forego a profit to ourselves than to suffer those whom we\nconsider as our enemies to make any profit by our means. Not only half the\nold subsidy, but the second twenty-five per cent. is retained upon the\nexportation of all French goods.\nBy the fourth of the rules annexed to the old subsidy, the drawback\nallowed upon the exportation of all wines amounted to a great deal more\nthan half the duties which were at that time paid upon their importation;\nand it seems at that time to have been the object of the legislature to\ngive somewhat more than ordinary encouragement to the carrying trade in\nwine. Several of the other duties, too which were imposed either at the\nsame time or subsequent to the old subsidy, what is called the additional\nduty, the new subsidy, the one-third and two-thirds subsidies, the impost\n1692, the tonnage on wine, were allowed to be wholly drawn back upon\nexportation. All those duties, however, except the additional duty and\nimpost 1692, being paid down in ready money upon importation, the interest\nof so large a sum occasioned an expense, which made it unreasonable to\nexpect any profitable carrying trade in this article. Only a part,\ntherefore of the duty called the impost on wine, and no part of the\ntwenty-five pounds the ton upon French wines, or of the duties imposed in\n1745, in 1763, and in 1778, were allowed to be drawn back upon\nexportation. The two imposts of five per cent. imposed in 1779 and 1781,\nupon all the former duties of customs, being allowed to be wholly drawn\nback upon the exportation of all other goods, were likewise allowed to be\ndrawn back upon that of wine. The last duty that has been particularly\nimposed upon wine, that of 1780, is allowed to be wholly drawn back; an\nindulgence which, when so many heavy duties are retained, most probably\ncould never occasion the exportation of a single ton of wine. These rules\ntook place with regard to all places of lawful exportation, except the\nBritish colonies in America.\nThe 15th Charles II, chap. 7, called an act for the encouragement of\ntrade, had given Great Britain the monopoly of supplying the colonies with\nall the commodities of the growth or manufacture of Europe, and\nconsequently with wines. In a country of so extensive a coast as our North\nAmerican and West Indian colonies, where our authority was always so very\nslender, and where the inhabitants were allowed to carry out in their own\nships their non-enumerated commodities, at first to all parts of Europe,\nand afterwards to all parts of Europe south of Cape Finisterre, it is not\nvery probable that this monopoly could ever be much respected; and they\nprobably at all times found means of bringing back some cargo from the\ncountries to which they were allowed to carry out one. They seem, however,\nto have found some difficulty in importing European wines from the places\nof their growth; and they could not well import them from Great Britain,\nwhere they were loaded with many heavy duties, of which a considerable\npart was not drawn back upon exportation. Madeira wine, not being an\nEuropean commodity, could be imported directly into America and the West\nIndies, countries which, in all their non-enumerated commodities, enjoyed\na free trade to the island of Madeira. These circumstances had probably\nintroduced that general taste for Madeira wine, which our officers found\nestablished in all our colonies at the commencement of the war which began\nin 1755, and which they brought back with them to the mother country,\nwhere that wine had not been much in fashion before. Upon the conclusion\nof that war, in 1763 (by the 4th Geo. III, chap. 15, sect. 12), all the\nduties except \u00a33, 10s. were allowed to be drawn back upon the exportation\nto the colonies of all wines, except French wines, to the commerce and\nconsumption of which national prejudice would allow no sort of\nencouragement. The period between the granting of this indulgence and the\nrevolt of our North American colonies, was probably too short to admit of\nany considerable change in the customs of those countries.\nThe same act which, in the drawbacks upon all wines, except French wines,\nthus favoured the colonies so much more than other countries, in those\nupon the greater part of other commodities, favoured them much less. Upon\nthe exportation of the greater part of commodities to other countries,\nhalf the old subsidy was drawn back. But this law enacted, that no part of\nthat duty should be drawn back upon the exportation to the colonies of any\ncommodities of the growth or manufacture either of Europe or the East\nIndies, except wines, white calicoes, and muslins.\nDrawbacks were, perhaps, originally granted for the encouragement of the\ncarrying trade, which, as the freight of the ship is frequently paid by\nforeigners in money, was supposed to be peculiarly fitted for bringing\ngold and silver into the country. But though the carrying trade certainly\ndeserves no peculiar encouragement, though the motive of the institution\nwas, perhaps, abundantly foolish, the institution itself seems reasonable\nenough. Such drawbacks cannot force into this trade a greater share of the\ncapital of the country than what would have gone to it of its own accord,\nhad there been no duties upon importation; they only prevent its being\nexcluded altogether by those duties. The carrying trade, though it\ndeserves no preference, ought not to be precluded, but to be left free,\nlike all other trades. It is a necessary resource to those capitals which\ncannot find employment, either in the agriculture or in the manufactures\nof the country, either in its home trade, or in its foreign trade of\nconsumption.\nThe revenue of the customs, instead of suffering, profits from such\ndrawbacks, by that part of the duty which is retained. If the whole duties\nhad been retained, the foreign goods upon which they are paid could seldom\nhave been exported, nor consequently imported, for want of a market. The\nduties, therefore, of which a part is retained, would never have been\npaid.\nThese reasons seem sufficiently to justify drawbacks, and would justify\nthem, though the whole duties, whether upon the produce of domestic\nindustry or upon foreign goods, were always drawn back upon exportation.\nThe revenue of excise would, in this case indeed, suffer a little, and\nthat of the customs a good deal more; but the natural balance of industry,\nthe natural division and distribution of labour, which is always more or\nless disturbed by such duties, would be more nearly re-established by such\na regulation.\nThese reasons, however, will justify drawbacks only upon exporting goods\nto those countries which are altogether foreign and independent, not to\nthose in which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy a monopoly. A\ndrawback, for example, upon the exportation of European goods to our\nAmerican colonies, will not always occasion a greater exportation than\nwhat would have taken place without it. By means of the monopoly which our\nmerchants and manufacturers enjoy there, the same quantity might\nfrequently, perhaps, be sent thither, though the whole duties were\nretained. The drawback, therefore, may frequently be pure loss to the\nrevenue of excise and customs, without altering the state of the trade, or\nrendering it in any respect more extensive. How far such drawbacks can be\njustified as a proper encouragement to the industry of our colonies, or\nhow far it is advantageous to the mother country that they should be\nexempted from taxes which are paid by all the rest of their\nfellow-subjects, will appear hereafter, when I come to treat of colonies.\nDrawbacks, however, it must always be understood, are useful only in those\ncases in which the goods, for the exportation of which they are given, are\nreally exported to some foreign country, and not clandestinely re-imported\ninto our own. That some drawbacks, particularly those upon tobacco, have\nfrequently been abused in this manner, and have given occasion to many\nfrauds, equally hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair trader, is\nwell known.\nCHAPTER V.\nOF BOUNTIES.\nBounties upon exportation are, in Great Britain, frequently petitioned\nfor, and sometimes granted, to the produce of particular branches of\ndomestic industry. By means of them, our merchants and manufacturers, it\nis pretended, will be enabled to sell their goods as cheap or cheaper than\ntheir rivals in the foreign market. A greater quantity, it is said, will\nthus be exported, and the balance of trade consequently turned more in\nfavour of our own country. We cannot give our workmen a monopoly in the\nforeign, as we have done in the home market. We cannot force foreigners to\nbuy their goods, as we have done our own countrymen. The next best\nexpedient, it has been thought, therefore, is to pay them for buying. It\nis in this manner that the mercantile system proposes to enrich the whole\ncountry, and to put money into all our pockets, by means of the balance of\ntrade.\nBounties, it is allowed, ought to be given to those branches of trade only\nwhich cannot be carried on without them. But every branch of trade in\nwhich the merchant can sell his goods for a price which replaces to him,\nwith the ordinary profits of stock, the whole capital employed in\npreparing and sending them to market, can be carried on without a bounty.\nEvery such branch is evidently upon a level with all the other branches of\ntrade which are carried on without bounties, and cannot, therefore,\nrequire one more than they. Those trades only require bounties, in which\nthe merchant is obliged to sell his goods for a price which does not\nreplace to him his capital, together with the ordinary profit, or in which\nhe is obliged to sell them for less than it really cost him to send them\nto market. The bounty is given in order to make up this loss, and to\nencourage him to continue, or, perhaps, to begin a trade, of which the\nexpense is supposed to be greater than the returns, of which every\noperation eats up a part of the capital employed in it, and which is of\nsuch a nature, that if all other trades resembled it, there would soon be\nno capital left in the country.\nThe trades, it is to be observed, which are carried on by means of\nbounties, are the only ones which can be carried on between two nations\nfor any considerable time together, in such a manner as that one of them\nshall always and regularly lose, or sell its goods for less than it\nreally cost to send them to market. But if the bounty did not repay to the\nmerchant what he would otherwise lose upon the price of his goods, his own\ninterest would soon oblige him to employ his stock in another way, or to\nfind out a trade in which the price of the goods would replace to him,\nwith the ordinary profit, the capital employed in sending them to market.\nThe effect of bounties, like that of all the other expedients of the\nmercantile system, can only be to force the trade of a country into a\nchannel much less advantageous than that in which it would naturally run\nof its own accord.\nThe ingenious and well-informed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade\nhas shown very clearly, that since the bounty upon the exportation of corn\nwas first established, the price of the corn exported, valued moderately\nenough, has exceeded that of the corn imported, valued very high, by a\nmuch greater sum than the amount of the whole bounties which have been\npaid during that period. This, he imagines, upon the true principles of\nthe mercantile system, is a clear proof that this forced corn trade is\nbeneficial to the nation, the value of the exportation exceeding that of\nthe importation by a much greater sum than the whole extraordinary expense\nwhich the public has been at in order to get it exported. He does not\nconsider that this extraordinary expense, or the bounty, is the smallest\npart of the expense which the exportation of corn really costs the\nsociety. The capital which the farmer employed in raising it must likewise\nbe taken into the account. Unless the price of the corn, when sold in the\nforeign markets, replaces not only the bounty, but this capital, together\nwith the ordinary profits of stock, the society is a loser by the\ndifference, or the national stock is so much diminished. But the very\nreason for which it has been thought necessary to grant a bounty, is the\nsupposed insufficiency of the price to do this.\nThe average price of corn, it has been said, has fallen considerably since\nthe establishment of the bounty. That the average price of corn began to\nfall somewhat towards the end of the last century, and has continued to do\nso during the course of the sixty-four first years of the present, I have\nalready endeavoured to show. But this event, supposing it to be real, as I\nbelieve it to be, must have happened in spite of the bounty, and cannot\npossibly have happened in consequence of it. It has happened in France, as\nwell as in England, though in France there was not only no bounty, but,\ntill 1764, the exportation of corn was subjected to a general prohibition.\nThis gradual fall in the average price of grain, it is probable,\ntherefore, is ultimately owing neither to the one regulation nor to the\nother, but to that gradual and insensible rise in the real value of\nsilver, which, in the first book of this discourse, I have endeavoured to\nshow, has taken place in the general market of Europe during the course of\nthe present century. It seems to be altogether impossible that the bounty\ncould ever contribute to lower the price of grain.\nIn years of plenty, it has already been observed, the bounty, by\noccasioning an extraordinary exportation, necessarily keeps up the price\nof corn in the home market above what it would naturally fall to. To do so\nwas the avowed purpose of the institution. In years of scarcity, though\nthe bounty is frequently suspended, yet the great exportation which it\noccasions in years of plenty, must frequently hinder, more or less, the\nplenty of one year from relieving the scarcity of another. Both in years\nof plenty and in years of scarcity, therefore, the bounty necessarily\ntends to raise the money price of corn somewhat higher than it otherwise\nwould be in the home market.\nThat in the actual state of tillage the bounty must necessarily have this\ntendency, will not, I apprehend, be disputed by any reasonable person. But\nit has been thought by many people, that it tends to encourage tillage,\nand that in two different ways; first, by opening a more extensive foreign\nmarket to the corn of the farmer, it tends, they imagine, to increase the\ndemand for, and consequently the production of, that commodity; and,\nsecondly by securing to him a better price than he could otherwise expect\nin the actual state of tillage, it tends, they suppose, to encourage\ntillage. This double encouragement must they imagine, in a long period of\nyears, occasion such an increase in the production of corn, as may lower\nits price in the home market, much more than the bounty can raise it in\nthe actual state which tillage may, at the end of that period, happen to\nbe in.\nI answer, that whatever extension of the foreign market can be occasioned\nby the bounty must, in every particular year, be altogether at the expense\nof the home market; as every bushel of corn, which is exported by means of\nthe bounty, and which would not have been exported without the bounty,\nwould have remained in the home market to increase the consumption, and to\nlower the price of that commodity. The corn bounty, it is to be observed,\nas well as every other bounty upon exportation, imposes two different\ntaxes upon the people; first, the tax which they are obliged to\ncontribute, in order to pay the bounty; and, secondly, the tax which\narises from the advanced price of the commodity in the home market, and\nwhich, as the whole body of the people are purchasers of corn, must, in\nthis particular commodity, be paid by the whole body of the people. In\nthis particular commodity, therefore, this second tax is by much the\nheaviest of the two. Let us suppose that, taking one year with another,\nthe bounty of 5s. upon the exportation of the quarter of wheat raises the\nprice of that commodity in the home market only 6d. the bushel, or 4s. the\nquarter higher than it otherwise would have been in the actual state of\nthe crop. Even upon this very moderate supposition, the great body of the\npeople, over and above contributing the tax which pays the bounty of 5s.\nupon every quarter of wheat exported, must pay another of 4s. upon every\nquarter which they themselves consume. But according to the very well\ninformed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, the average proportion\nof the corn exported to that consumed at home, is not more than that of\none to thirty-one. For every 5s. therefore, which they contribute to the\npayment of the first tax, they must contribute \u00a36:4s. to the payment of\nthe second. So very heavy a tax upon the first necessary of life-must\neither reduce the subsistence of the labouring poor, or it must occasion\nsome augmentation in their pecuniary wages, proportionable to that in the\npecuniary price of their subsistence. So far as it operates in the one\nway, it must reduce the ability of the labouring poor to educate and bring\nup their children, and must, so far, tend to restrain the population of\nthe country. So far as it operates in the other, it must reduce the\nability of the employers of the poor, to employ so great a number as they\notherwise might do, and must so far tend to restrain the industry of the\ncountry. The extraordinary exportation of corn, therefore occasioned by\nthe bounty, not only in every particular year diminishes the home, just as\nmuch as it extends the foreign market and consumption, but, by restraining\nthe population and industry of the country, its final tendency is to stint\nand restrain the gradual extension of the home market; and thereby, in the\nlong-run, rather to diminish than to augment the whole market and\nconsumption of corn.\nThis enhancement of the money price of corn, however, it has been thought,\nby rendering that commodity more profitable to the farmer, must\nnecessarily encourage its production.\nI answer, that this might be the case, if the effect of the bounty was to\nraise the real price of corn, or to enable the farmer, with an equal\nquantity of it, to maintain a greater number of labourers in the same\nmanner, whether liberal, moderate, or scanty, than other labourers are\ncommonly maintained in his neighbourhood. But neither the bounty, it is\nevident, nor any other human institution, can have any such effect. It is\nnot the real, but the nominal price of corn, which can in any considerable\ndegree be affected by the bounty. And though the tax, which that\ninstitution imposes upon the whole body of the people, may be very\nburdensome to those who pay it, it is of very little advantage to those\nwho receive it.\nThe real effect of the bounty is not so much to raise the real value of\ncorn, as to degrade the real value of silver; or to make an equal quantity\nof it exchange for a smaller quantity, not only of corn, but of all other\nhome made commodities; for the money price of corn regulates that of all\nother home made commodities.\nIt regulates the money price of labour, which must always be such as to\nenable the labourer to purchase a quantity of corn sufficient to maintain\nhim and his family, either in the liberal, moderate, or scanty manner, in\nwhich the advancing, stationary, or declining, circumstances of the\nsociety, oblige his employers to maintain him.\nIt regulates the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce of\nland, which, in every period of improvement, must bear a certain\nproportion to that of corn, though this proportion is different in\ndifferent periods. It regulates, for example, the money price of grass and\nhay, of butcher\u2019s meat, of horses, and the maintenance of horses, of land\ncarriage consequently, or of the greater part of the inland commerce of\nthe country.\nBy regulating the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce\nof land, it regulates that of the materials of almost all manufactures; by\nregulating the money price of labour, it regulates that of manufacturing\nart and industry; and by regulating both, it regulates that of the\ncomplete manufacture. The money price of labour, and of every thing that\nis the produce, either of land or labour, must necessarily either rise or\nfall in proportion to the money price of corn.\nThough in consequence of the bounty, therefore, the farmer should be\nenabled to sell his corn for 4s. the bushel, instead of 3s:6d. and to pay\nhis landlord a money rent proportionable to this rise in the money price\nof his produce; yet if, in consequence of this rise in the price of corn,\n4s. will purchase no more home made goods of any other kind than 3s. 6d.\nwould have done before, neither the circumstances of the farmer, nor those\nof the landlord, will be much mended by this change. The farmer will not\nbe able to cultivate much better; the landlord will not be able to live\nmuch better. In the purchase of foreign commodities, this enhancement in\nthe price of corn may give them some little advantage. In that of home\nmade commodities, it can give them none at all. And almost the whole\nexpense of the farmer, and the far greater part even of that of the\nlandlord, is in home made commodities.\nThat degradation in the value of silver, which is the effect of the\nfertility of the mines, and which operates equally, or very nearly\nequally, through the greater part of the commercial world, is a matter of\nvery little consequence to any particular country. The consequent rise of\nall money prices, though it does not make those who receive them really\nricher, does not make them really poorer. A service of plate becomes\nreally cheaper, and every thing else remains precisely of the same real\nvalue as before.\nBut that degradation in the value of silver, which, being the effect\neither of the peculiar situation or of the political institutions of a\nparticular country, takes place only in that country, is a matter of very\ngreat consequence, which, far from tending to make anybody really richer,\ntends to make every body really poorer. The rise in the money price of all\ncommodities, which is in this case peculiar to that country, tends to\ndiscourage more or less every sort of industry which is carried on within\nit, and to enable foreign nations, by furnishing almost all sorts of goods\nfor a smaller quantity of silver than its own workmen can afford to do, to\nundersell them, not only in the foreign, but even in the home market.\nIt is the peculiar situation of Spain and Portugal, as proprietors of the\nmines, to be the distributers of gold and silver to all the other\ncountries of Europe. Those metals ought naturally, therefore, to be\nsomewhat cheaper in Spain and Portugal than in any other part of Europe.\nThe difference, however, should be no more than the amount of the freight\nand insurance; and, on account of the great value and small bulk of those\nmetals, their freight is no great matter, and their insurance is the same\nas that of any other goods of equal value. Spain and Portugal, therefore,\ncould suffer very little from their peculiar situation, if they did not\naggravate its disadvantages by their political institutions.\nSpain by taxing, and Portugal by prohibiting, the exportation of gold and\nsilver, load that exportation with the expense of smuggling, and raise the\nvalue of those metals in other countries so much more above what it is in\ntheir own, by the whole amount of this expense. When you dam up a stream\nof water, as soon as the dam is full, as much water must run over the\ndam-head as if there was no dam at all. The prohibition of exportation\ncannot detain a greater quantity of gold and silver in Spain and Portugal,\nthan what they can afford to employ, than what the annual produce of their\nland and labour will allow them to employ, in coin, plate, gilding, and\nother ornaments of gold and silver. When they have got this quantity, the\ndam is full, and the whole stream which flows in afterwards must run over.\nThe annual exportation of gold and silver from Spain and Portugal,\naccordingly, is, by all accounts, notwithstanding these restraints, very\nnear equal to the whole annual importation. As the water, however, must\nalways be deeper behind the dam-head than before it, so the quantity of\ngold and silver which these restraints detain in Spain and Portugal, must,\nin proportion to the annual produce of their land and labour, be greater\nthan what is to be found in other countries. The higher and stronger the\ndam-head, the greater must be the difference in the depth of water behind\nand before it. The higher the tax, the higher the penalties with which the\nprohibition is guarded, the more vigilant and severe the police which\nlooks after the execution of the law, the greater must be the difference\nin the proportion of gold and silver to the annual produce of the land and\nlabour of Spain and Portugal, and to that of other countries. It is said,\naccordingly, to be very considerable, and that you frequently find there a\nprofusion of plate in houses, where there is nothing else which would in\nother countries be thought suitable or correspondent to this sort of\nmagnificence. The cheapness of gold and silver, or, what is the same\nthing, the dearness of all commodities, which is the necessary effect of\nthis redundancy of the precious metals, discourages both the agriculture\nand manufactures of Spain and Portugal, and enables foreign nations to\nsupply them with many sorts of rude, and with almost all sorts of\nmanufactured produce, for a smaller quantity of gold and silver than what\nthey themselves can either raise or make them for at home. The tax and\nprohibition operate in two different ways. They not only lower very much\nthe value of the precious metals in Spain and Portugal, but by detaining\nthere a certain quantity of those metals which would otherwise flow over\nother countries, they keep up their value in those other countries\nsomewhat above what it otherwise would be, and thereby give those\ncountries a double advantage in their commerce with Spain and Portugal.\nOpen the flood-gates, and there will presently be less water above, and\nmore below the dam-head, and it will soon come to a level in both places.\nRemove the tax and the prohibition, and as the quantity of gold and silver\nwill diminish considerably in Spain and Portugal, so it will increase\nsomewhat in other countries; and the value of those metals, their\nproportion to the annual produce of land and labour, will soon come to a\nlevel, or very near to a level, in all. The loss which Spain and Portugal\ncould sustain by this exportation of their gold and silver, would be\naltogether nominal and imaginary. The nominal value of their goods, and of\nthe annual produce of their land and labour, would fall, and would be\nexpressed or represented by a smaller quantity of silver than before; but\ntheir real value would be the same as before, and would be sufficient to\nmaintain, command, and employ the same quantity of labour. As the nominal\nvalue of their goods would fall, the real value of what remained of their\ngold and silver would rise, and a smaller quantity of those metals would\nanswer all the same purposes of commerce and circulation which had\nemployed a greater quantity before. The gold and silver which would go\nabroad would not go abroad for nothing, but would bring back an equal\nvalue of goods of some kind or other. Those goods, too, would not be all\nmatters of mere luxury and expense, to be consumed by idle people, who\nproduce nothing in return for their consumption. As the real wealth and\nrevenue of idle people would not be augmented by this extraordinary\nexportation of gold and silver, so neither would their consumption be much\naugmented by it. Those goods would probably, the greater part of them, and\ncertainly some part of them, consist in materials, tools, and provisions,\nfor the employment and maintenance of industrious people, who would\nreproduce, with a profit, the full value of their consumption. A part of\nthe dead stock of the society would thus be turned into active stock, and\nwould put into motion a greater quantity of industry than had been\nemployed before. The annual produce of their land and labour would\nimmediately be augmented a little, and in a few years would probably be\naugmented a great deal; their industry being thus relieved from one of the\nmost oppressive burdens which it at present labours under.\nThe bounty upon the exportation of corn necessarily operates exactly in\nthe same way as this absurd policy of Spain and Portugal. Whatever be the\nactual state of tillage, it renders our corn somewhat dearer in the home\nmarket than it otherwise would be in that state, and somewhat cheaper in\nthe foreign; and as the average money price of corn regulates, more or\nless, that of all other commodities, it lowers the value of silver\nconsiderably in the one, and tends to raise it a little in the other. It\nenables foreigners, the Dutch in particular, not only to eat our corn\ncheaper than they otherwise could do, but sometimes to eat it cheaper than\neven our own people can do upon the same occasions; as we are assured by\nan excellent authority, that of Sir Matthew Decker. It hinders our own\nworkmen from furnishing their goods for so small a quantity of silver as\nthey otherwise might do, and enables the Dutch to furnish theirs for a\nsmaller. It tends to render our manufactures somewhat dearer in every\nmarket, and theirs somewhat cheaper, than they otherwise would be, and\nconsequently to give their industry a double advantage over our own.\nThe bounty, as it raises in the home market, not so much the real, as the\nnominal price of our corn; as it augments, not the quantity of labour\nwhich a certain quantity of corn can maintain and employ, but only the\nquantity of silver which it will exchange for; it discourages our\nmanufactures, without rendering any considerable service, either to our\nfarmers or country gentlemen. It puts, indeed, a little more money into\nthe pockets of both, and it will perhaps be somewhat difficult to persuade\nthe greater part of them that this is not rendering them a very\nconsiderable service. But if this money sinks in its value, in the\nquantity of labour, provisions, and home-made commodities of all different\nkinds which it is capable of purchasing, as much as it rises in its\nquantity, the service will be little more than nominal and imaginary.\nThere is, perhaps, but one set of men in the whole commonwealth to whom\nthe bounty either was or could be essentially serviceable. These were the\ncorn merchants, the exporters and importers of corn. In years of plenty,\nthe bounty necessarily occasioned a greater exportation than would\notherwise have taken place; and by hindering the plenty of the one year\nfrom relieving the scarcity of another, it occasioned in years of scarcity\na greater importation than would otherwise have been necessary. It\nincreased the business of the corn merchant in both; and in the years of\nscarcity, it not only enabled him to import a greater quantity, but to\nsell it for a better price, and consequently with a greater profit, than\nhe could otherwise have made, if the plenty of one year had not been more\nor less hindered from relieving the scarcity of another. It is in this set\nof men, accordingly, that I have observed the greatest zeal for the\ncontinuance or renewal of the bounty.\nOur country gentlemen, when they imposed the high duties upon the\nexportation of foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a\nprohibition, and when they established the bounty, seem to have imitated\nthe conduct of our manufacturers. By the one institution, they secured to\nthemselves the monopoly of the home market, and by the other they\nendeavoured to prevent that market from ever being overstocked with their\ncommodity. By both they endeavoured to raise its real value, in the same\nmanner as our manufacturers had, by the like institutions, raised the real\nvalue of many different sorts of manufactured goods. They did not,\nperhaps, attend to the great and essential difference which nature has\nestablished between corn and almost every other sort of goods. When,\neither by the monopoly of the home market, or by a bounty upon\nexportation, you enable our woollen or linen manufacturers to sell their\ngoods for somewhat a better price than they otherwise could get for them,\nyou raise, not only the nominal, but the real price of those goods; you\nrender them equivalent to a greater quantity of labour and subsistence;\nyou increase not only the nominal, but the real profit, the real wealth\nand revenue of those manufacturers; and you enable them, either to live\nbetter themselves, or to employ a greater quantity of labour in those\nparticular manufactures. You really encourage those manufactures, and\ndirect towards them a greater quantity of the industry of the country than\nwhat would properly go to them of its own accord. But when, by the like\ninstitutions, you raise the nominal or money price of corn, you do not\nraise its real value; you do not increase the real wealth, the real\nrevenue, either of our farmers or country gentlemen; you do not encourage\nthe growth of corn, because you do not enable them to maintain and employ\nmore labourers in raising it. The nature of things has stamped upon corn a\nreal value, which cannot be altered by merely altering its money price. No\nbounty upon exportation, no monopoly of the home market, can raise that\nvalue. The freest competition cannot lower it, Through the world in\ngeneral, that value is equal to the quantity of labour which it can\nmaintain, and in every particular place it is equal to the quantity of\nlabour which it can maintain in the way, whether liberal, moderate, or\nscanty, in which labour is commonly maintained in that place. Woollen or\nlinen cloth are not the regulating commodities by which the real value of\nall other commodities must be finally measured and determined; corn is.\nThe real value of every other commodity is finally measured and determined\nby the proportion which its average money price bears to the average money\nprice of corn. The real value of corn does not vary with those variations\nin its average money price, which sometimes occur from one century to\nanother; it is the real value of silver which varies with them.\nBounties upon the exportation of any homemade commodity are liable, first,\nto that general objection which may be made to all the different\nexpedients of the mercantile system; the objection of forcing some part of\nthe industry of the country into a channel less advantageous than that in\nwhich it would run of its own accord; and, secondly, to the particular\nobjection of forcing it not only into a channel that is less advantageous,\nbut into one that is actually disadvantageous; the trade which cannot be\ncarried on but by means of a bounty being necessarily a losing trade. The\nbounty upon the exportation of corn is liable to this further objection,\nthat it can in no respect promote the raising of that particular commodity\nof which it was meant to encourage the production. When our country\ngentlemen, therefore, demanded the establishment of the bounty, though\nthey acted in imitation of our merchants and manufacturers, they did not\nact with that complete comprehension of their own interest, which commonly\ndirects the conduct of those two other orders of people. They loaded the\npublic revenue with a very considerable expense: they imposed a very heavy\ntax upon the whole body of the people; but they did not, in any sensible\ndegree, increase the real value of their own commodity; and by lowering\nsomewhat the real value of silver, they discouraged, in some degree, the\ngeneral industry of the country, and, instead of advancing, retarded more\nor less the improvement of their own lands, which necessarily depend upon\nthe general industry of the country.\nTo encourage the production of any commodity, a bounty upon production,\none should imagine, would have a more direct operation than one upon\nexportation. It would, besides, impose only one tax upon the people, that\nwhich they must contribute in order to pay the bounty. Instead of raising,\nit would tend to lower the price of the commodity in the home market; and\nthereby, instead of imposing a second tax upon the people, it might, at\nleast in part, repay them for what they had contributed to the first.\nBounties upon production, however, have been very rarely granted. The\nprejudices established by the commercial system have taught us to believe,\nthat national wealth arises more immediately from exportation than from\nproduction. It has been more favoured, accordingly, as the more immediate\nmeans of bringing money into the country. Bounties upon production, it has\nbeen said too, have been found by experience more liable to frauds than\nthose upon exportation. How far this is true, I know not. That bounties\nupon exportation have been abused, to many fraudulent purposes, is very\nwell known. But it is not the interest of merchants and manufacturers, the\ngreat inventors of all these expedients, that the home market should be\noverstocked with their goods; an event which a bounty upon production\nmight sometimes occasion. A bounty upon exportation, by enabling them to\nsend abroad their surplus part, and to keep up the price of what remains\nin the home market, effectually prevents this. Of all the expedients of\nthe mercantile system, accordingly, it is the one of which they are the\nfondest. I have known the different undertakers of some particular works\nagree privately among themselves to give a bounty out of their own pockets\nupon the exportation of a certain proportion of the goods which they dealt\nin. This expedient succeeded so well, that it more than doubled the price\nof their goods in the home market, notwithstanding a very considerable\nincrease in the produce. The operation of the bounty upon corn must have\nbeen wonderfully different, if it has lowered the money price of that\ncommodity.\nSomething like a bounty upon production, however, has been granted upon\nsome particular occasions. The tonnage bounties given to the white herring\nand whale fisheries may, perhaps, be considered as somewhat of this\nnature. They tend directly, it may be supposed, to render the goods\ncheaper in the home market than they otherwise would be. In other\nrespects, their effects, it must be acknowledged, are the same as those of\nbounties upon exportation. By means of them, a part of the capital of the\ncountry is employed in bringing goods to market, of which the price does\nnot repay the cost, together with the ordinary profits of stock.\nBut though the tonnage bounties to those fisheries do not contribute to\nthe opulence of the nation, it may, perhaps, be thought that they\ncontribute to its defence, by augmenting the number of its sailors and\nshipping. This, it may be alleged, may sometimes be done by means of such\nbounties, at a much smaller expense than by keeping up a great standing\nnavy, if I may use such an expression, in the same way as a standing army.\nNotwithstanding these favourable allegations, however, the following\nconsiderations dispose me to believe, that in granting at least one of\nthese bounties, the legislature has been very grossly imposed upon:\nFirst, The herring-buss bounty seems too large.\nFrom the commencement of the winter fishing 1771, to the end of the winter\nfishing 1781, the tonnage bounty upon the herring-buss fishery has been at\nthirty shillings the ton. During these eleven years, the whole number of\nbarrels caught by the herring-buss fishery of Scotland amounted to\n378,347. The herrings caught and cured at sea are called sea-sticks. In\norder to render them what are called merchantable herrings, it is\nnecessary to repack them with an additional quantity of salt; and in this\ncase, it is reckoned, that three barrels of sea-sticks are usually\nrepacked into two barrels of merchantable herrings. The number of barrels\nof merchantable herrings, therefore, caught during these eleven years,\nwill amount only, according to this account, to 252,231\u00bc. During these\neleven years, the tonnage bounties paid amounted to \u00a3155,463:11s. or\n8s:2\u00bcd. upon every barrel of sea-sticks, and to 12s:3\u00bed. upon every barrel\nof merchantable herrings.\nThe salt with which these herrings are cured is sometimes Scotch, and\nsometimes foreign salt; both which are delivered, free of all excise duty,\nto the fish-curers. The excise duty upon Scotch salt is at present 1s:6d.,\nthat upon foreign salt 10s. the bushel. A barrel of herrings is supposed\nto require about one bushel and one-fourth of a bushel foreign salt. Two\nbushels are the supposed average of Scotch salt. If the herrings are\nentered for exportation, no part of this duty is paid up; if entered for\nhome consumption, whether the herrings were cured with foreign or with\nScotch salt, only one shilling the barrel is paid up. It was the old\nScotch duty upon a bushel of salt, the quantity which, at a low\nestimation, had been supposed necessary for curing a barrel of herrings.\nIn Scotland, foreign salt is very little used for any other purpose but\nthe curing of fish. But from the 5th April 1771 to the 5th April 1782, the\nquantity of foreign salt imported amounted to 936,974 bushels, at\neighty-four pounds the bushel; the quantity of Scotch salt delivered from\nthe works to the fish-curers, to no more than 168,226, at fifty-six pounds\nthe bushel only. It would appear, therefore, that it is principally\nforeign salt that is used in the fisheries. Upon every barrel of herrings\nexported, there is, besides, a bounty of 2s:8d. and more than two-thirds\nof the buss-caught herrings are exported. Put all these things together,\nand you will find that, during these eleven years, every barrel of\nbuss-caught herrings, cured with Scotch salt, when exported, has cost\ngovernment 17s:11\u00bed.; and, when entered for home consumption, 14s:3\u00bed.;\nand that every barrel cured with foreign salt, when exported, has cost\ngovernment \u00a31:7:5\u00bed.; and, when entered for home consumption, \u00a31:3:9\u00bed.\nThe price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings runs from seventeen\nand eighteen to four and five-and-twenty shillings; about a guinea at an\naverage. {See the accounts at the end of this Book.}\nSecondly, The bounty to the white-herring fishery is a tonnage bounty, and\nis proportioned to the burden of the ship, not to her diligence or success\nin the fishery; and it has, I am afraid, been too common for the vessels\nto fit out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish but the bounty.\nIn the year 1759, when the bounty was at fifty shillings the ton, the\nwhole buss fishery of Scotland brought in only four barrels of sea-sticks.\nIn that year, each barrel of sea-sticks cost government, in bounties\nalone, \u00a3113:15s.; each barrel of merchantable herrings \u00a3159:7:6.\nThirdly, The mode of fishing, for which this tonnage bounty in the white\nherring fishery has been given (by busses or decked vessels from twenty to\neighty tons burden ), seems not so well adapted to the situation of\nScotland, as to that of Holland, from the practice of which country it\nappears to have been borrowed. Holland lies at a great distance from the\nseas to which herrings are known principally to resort, and can,\ntherefore, carry on that fishery only in decked vessels, which can carry\nwater and provisions sufficient for a voyage to a distant sea; but the\nHebrides, or Western Islands, the islands of Shetland, and the northern\nand north-western coasts of Scotland, the countries in whose neighbourhood\nthe herring fishery is principally carried on, are everywhere intersected\nby arms of the sea, which run up a considerable way into the land, and\nwhich, in the language of the country, are called sea-lochs. It is to\nthese sea-lochs that the herrings principally resort during the seasons in\nwhich they visit these seas; for the visits of this, and, I am assured, of\nmany other sorts of fish, are not quite regular and constant. A\nboat-fishery, therefore, seems to be the mode of fishing best adapted to\nthe peculiar situation of Scotland, the fishers carrying the herrings on\nshore as fast as they are taken, to be either cured or consumed fresh. But\nthe great encouragement which a bounty of 30s. the ton gives to the\nbuss-fishery, is necessarily a discouragement to the boat-fishery, which,\nhaving no such bounty, cannot bring its cured fish to market upon the same\nterms as the buss-fishery. The boat-fishery; accordingly, which, before\nthe establishment of the buss-bounty, was very considerable, and is said\nto have employed a number of seamen, not inferior to what the buss-fishery\nemploys at present, is now gone almost entirely to decay. Of the former\nextent, however, of this now ruined and abandoned fishery, I must\nacknowledge that I cannot pretend to speak with much precision. As no\nbounty was-paid upon the outfit of the boat-fishery, no account was taken\nof it by the officers of the customs or salt duties.\nFourthly, In many parts of Scotland, during certain seasons of the year,\nherrings make no inconsiderable part of the food of the common people. A\nbounty which tended to lower their price in the home market, might\ncontribute a good deal to the relief of a great number of our\nfellow-subjects, whose circumstances are by no means affluent. But the\nherring-bus bounty contributes to no such good purpose. It has ruined the\nboat fishery, which is by far the best adapted for the supply of the home\nmarket; and the additional bounty of 2s:8d. the barrel upon exportation,\ncarries the greater part, more than two-thirds, of the produce of the\nbuss-fishery abroad. Between thirty and forty years ago, before the\nestablishment of the buss-bounty, 16s. the barrel, I have been assured,\nwas the common price of white herrings. Between ten and fifteen years ago,\nbefore the boat-fishery was entirely ruined, the price was said to have\nrun from seventeen to twenty shillings the barrel. For these last five\nyears, it has, at an average, been at twenty-five shillings the barrel.\nThis high price, however, may have been owing to the real scarcity of the\nherrings upon the coast of Scotland. I must observe, too, that the cask or\nbarrel, which is usually sold with the herrings, and of which the price is\nincluded in all the foregoing prices, has, since the commencement of the\nAmerican war, risen to about double its former price, or from about 3s. to\nabout 6s. I must likewise observe, that the accounts I have received of\nthe prices of former times, have been by no means quite uniform and\nconsistent, and an old man of great accuracy and experience has assured\nme, that, more than fifty years ago, a guinea was the usual price of a\nbarrel of good merchantable herrings; and this, I imagine, may still be\nlooked upon as the average price. All accounts, however, I think, agree\nthat the price has not been lowered in the home market in consequence of\nthe buss-bounty.\nWhen the undertakers of fisheries, after such liberal bounties have been\nbestowed upon them, continue to sell their commodity at the same, or even\nat a higher price than they were accustomed to do before, it might be\nexpected that their profits should be very great; and it is not improbable\nthat those of some individuals may have been so. In general, however, I\nhave every reason to believe they have been quite otherwise. The usual\neffect of such bounties is, to encourage rash undertakers to adventure in\na business which they do not understand; and what they lose by their own\nnegligence and ignorance, more than compensates all that they can gain by\nthe utmost liberality of government. In 1750, by the same act which first\ngave the bounty of 30s. the ton for the encouragement of the white herring\nfishery (the 23d Geo. II. chap. 24), a joint stock company was erected,\nwith a capital of \u00a3500,000, to which the subscribers (over and above all\nother encouragements, the tonnage bounty just now mentioned, the\nexportation bounty of 2s:8d. the barrel, the delivery of both British and\nforeign salt duty free) were, during the space of fourteen years, for\nevery hundred pounds which they subscribed and paid into the stock of the\nsociety, entitled to three pounds a-year, to be paid by the\nreceiver-general of the customs in equal half-yearly payments. Besides\nthis great company, the residence of whose governor and directors was to\nbe in London, it was declared lawful to erect different fishing chambers\nin all the different out-ports of the kingdom, provided a sum not less\nthan \u00a310,000 was subscribed into the capital of each, to be managed at its\nown risk, and for its own profit and loss. The same annuity, and the same\nencouragements of all kinds, were given to the trade of those inferior\nchambers as to that of the great company. The subscription of the great\ncompany was soon filled up, and several different fishing chambers were\nerected in the different out-ports of the kingdom. In spite of all these\nencouragements, almost all those different companies, both great and\nsmall, lost either the whole or the greater part of their capitals; scarce\na vestige now remains of any of them, and the white-herring fishery is now\nentirely, or almost entirely, carried on by private adventurers.\nIf any particular manufacture was necessary, indeed, for the defence of\nthe society, it might not always be prudent to depend upon our neighbours\nfor the supply; and if such manufacture could not otherwise be supported\nat home, it might not be unreasonable that all the other branches of\nindustry should be taxed in order to support it. The bounties upon the\nexportation of British made sail-cloth, and British made gunpowder, may,\nperhaps, both be vindicated upon this principle.\nBut though it can very seldom be reasonable to tax the industry of the\ngreat body of the people, in order to support that of some particular\nclass of manufacturers; yet, in the wantonness of great prosperity, when\nthe public enjoys a greater revenue than it knows well what to do with, to\ngive such bounties to favourite manufactures, may, perhaps, be as natural\nas to incur any other idle expense. In public, as well as in private\nexpenses, great wealth, may, perhaps, frequently be admitted as an apology\nfor great folly. But there must surely be something more than ordinary\nabsurdity in continuing such profusion in times of general difficulty and\ndistress.\nWhat is called a bounty, is sometimes no more than a drawback, and,\nconsequently, is not liable to the same objections as what is properly a\nbounty. The bounty, for example, upon refined sugar exported, may be\nconsidered as a drawback of the duties upon the brown and Muscovado\nsugars, from which it is made; the bounty upon wrought silk exported, a\ndrawback of the duties upon raw and thrown silk imported; the bounty upon\ngunpowder exported, a drawback of the duties upon brimstone and saltpetre\nimported. In the language of the customs, those allowances only are called\ndrawbacks which are given upon goods exported in the same form in which\nthey are imported. When that form has been so altered by manufacture of\nany kind as to come under a new denomination, they are called bounties.\nPremiums given by the public to artists and manufacturers, who excel in\ntheir particular occupations, are not liable to the same objections as\nbounties. By encouraging extraordinary dexterity and ingenuity, they serve\nto keep up the emulation of the workmen actually employed in those\nrespective occupations, and are not considerable enough to turn towards\nany one of them a greater share of the capital of the country than what\nwould go to it of its own accord. Their tendency is not to overturn the\nnatural balance of employments, but to render the work which is done in\neach as perfect and complete as possible. The expense of premiums,\nbesides, is very trifling, that of bounties very great. The bounty upon\ncorn alone has sometimes cost the public, in one year, more than \u00a3300,000.\nBounties are sometimes called premiums, as drawbacks are sometimes called\nbounties. But we must, in all cases, attend to the nature of the thing,\nwithout paying any regard to the word.\nDigression concerning the Corn Trade and Corn Laws.\nI cannot conclude this chapter concerning bounties, without observing,\nthat the praises which have been bestowed upon the law which establishes\nthe bounty upon the exportation of corn, and upon that system of\nregulations which is connected with it, are altogether unmerited. A\nparticular examination of the nature of the corn trade, and of the\nprincipal British laws which relate to it, will sufficiently demonstrate\nthe truth of this assertion. The great importance of this subject must\njustify the length of the digression.\nThe trade of the corn merchant is composed of four different branches,\nwhich, though they may sometimes be all carried on by the same person,\nare, in their own nature, four separate and distinct trades. These are,\nfirst, the trade of the inland dealer; secondly, that of the\nmerchant-importer for home consumption; thirdly, that of the\nmerchant-exporter of home produce for foreign consumption; and, fourthly,\nthat of the merchant-carrier, or of the importer of corn, in order to\nexport it again.\nI. The interest of the inland dealer, and that of the great body of the\npeople, how opposite soever they may at first appear, are, even in years\nof the greatest scarcity, exactly the same. It is his interest to raise\nthe price of his corn as high as the real scarcity of the season\nrequires, and it can never be his interest to raise it higher. By raising\nthe price, he discourages the consumption, and puts every body more or\nless, but particularly the inferior ranks of people, upon thrift and good\nmanagement. If, by raising it too high, he discourages the consumption so\nmuch that the supply of the season is likely to go beyond the consumption\nof the season, and to last for some time after the next crop begins to\ncome in, he runs the hazard, not only of losing a considerable part of\nhis corn by natural causes, but of being obliged to sell what remains of\nit for much less than what he might have had for it several months\nbefore. If, by not raising the price high enough, he discourages the\nconsumption so little, that the supply of the season is likely to fall\nshort of the consumption of the season, he not only loses a part of the\nprofit which he might otherwise have made, but he exposes the people to\nsuffer before the end of the season, instead of the hardships of a\ndearth, the dreadful horrors of a famine. It is the interest of the\npeople that their daily, weekly, and monthly consumption should be\nproportioned as exactly as possible to the supply of the season. The\ninterest of the inland corn dealer is the same. By supplying them, as\nnearly as he can judge, in this proportion, he is likely to sell all his\ncorn for the highest price, and with the greatest profit; and his\nknowledge of the state of the crop, and of his daily, weekly, and monthly\nsales, enables him to judge, with more or less accuracy, how far they\nreally are supplied in this manner. Without intending the interest of the\npeople, he is necessarily led, by a regard to his own interest, to treat\nthem, even in years of scarcity, pretty much in the same manner as the\nprudent master of a vessel is sometimes obliged to treat his crew. When\nhe foresees that provisions are likely to run short, he puts them upon\nshort allowance. Though from excess of caution he should sometimes do\nthis without any real necessity, yet all the inconveniencies which his\ncrew can thereby suffer are inconsiderable, in comparison of the danger,\nmisery, and ruin, to which they might sometimes be exposed by a less\nprovident conduct. Though, from excess of avarice, in the same manner,\nthe inland corn merchant should sometimes raise the price of his corn\nsomewhat higher than the scarcity of the season requires, yet all the\ninconveniencies which the people can suffer from this conduct, which\neffectually secures them from a famine in the end of the season, are\ninconsiderable, in comparison of what they might have been exposed to by\na more liberal way of dealing in the beginning of it the corn merchant\nhimself is likely to suffer the most by this excess of avarice; not only\nfrom the indignation which it generally excites against him, but, though\nhe should escape the effects of this indignation, from the quantity of\ncorn which it necessarily leaves upon his hands in the end of the season,\nand which, if the next season happens to prove favourable, he must always\nsell for a much lower price than he might otherwise have had.\nWere it possible, indeed, for one great company of merchants to possess\nthemselves of the whole crop of an extensive country, it might perhaps be\ntheir interest to deal with it, as the Dutch are said to do with the\nspiceries of the Moluccas, to destroy or throw away a considerable part of\nit, in order to keep up the price of the rest. But it is scarce possible,\neven by the violence of law, to establish such an extensive monopoly with\nregard to corn; and wherever the law leaves the trade free, it is of all\ncommodities the least liable to be engrossed or monopolised by the force\na few large capitals, which buy up the greater part of it. Not only its\nvalue far exceeds what the capitals of a few private men are capable of\npurchasing; but, supposing they were capable of purchasing it, the manner\nin which it is produced renders this purchase altogether impracticable.\nAs, in every civilized country, it is the commodity of which the annual\nconsumption is the greatest; so a greater quantity of industry is annually\nemployed in producing corn than in producing any other commodity. When it\nfirst comes from the ground, too, it is necessarily divided among a\ngreater number of owners than any other commodity; and these owners can\nnever be collected into one place, like a number of independent\nmanufacturers, but are necessarily scattered through all the different\ncorners of the country. These first owners either immediately supply the\nconsumers in their own neighbourhood, or they supply other inland dealers,\nwho supply those consumers. The inland dealers in corn, therefore,\nincluding both the farmer and the baker, are necessarily more numerous\nthan the dealers in any other commodity; and their dispersed situation\nrenders it altogether impossible for them to enter into any general\ncombination. If, in a year of scarcity, therefore, any of them should find\nthat he had a good deal more corn upon hand than, at the current price, he\ncould hope to dispose of before the end of the season, he would never\nthink of keeping up this price to his own loss, and to the sole benefit of\nhis rivals and competitors, but would immediately lower it, in order to\nget rid of his corn before the new crop began to come in. The same\nmotives, the same interests, which would thus regulate the conduct of any\none dealer, would regulate that of every other, and oblige them all in\ngeneral to sell their corn at the price which, according to the best of\ntheir judgment, was most suitable to the scarcity or plenty of the season.\nWhoever examines, with attention, the history of the dearths and famines\nwhich have afflicted any part of Europe during either the course of the\npresent or that of the two preceding centuries, of several of which we\nhave pretty exact accounts, will find, I believe, that a dearth never has\narisen from any combination among the inland dealers in corn, nor from any\nother cause but a real scarcity, occasioned sometimes, perhaps, and in\nsome particular places, by the waste of war, but in by far the greatest\nnumber of cases by the fault of the seasons; and that a famine has never\narisen from any other cause but the violence of government attempting, by\nimproper means, to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth.\nIn an extensive corn country, between all the different parts of which\nthere is a free commerce and communication, the scarcity occasioned by the\nmost unfavourable seasons can never be so great as to produce a famine;\nand the scantiest crop, if managed with frugality and economy, will\nmaintain, through the year, the same number of people that are commonly\nfed in a more affluent manner by one of moderate plenty. The seasons most\nunfavourable to the crop are those of excessive drought or excessive rain.\nBut as corn grows equally upon high and low lands, upon grounds that are\ndisposed to be too wet, and upon those that are disposed to be too dry,\neither the drought or the rain, which is hurtful to one part of the\ncountry, is favourable to another; and though, both in the wet and in the\ndry season, the crop is a good deal less than in one more properly\ntempered; yet, in both, what is lost in one part of the country is in some\nmeasure compensated by what is gained in the other. In rice countries,\nwhere the crop not only requires a very moist soil, but where, in a\ncertain period of its growing, it must be laid under water, the effects of\na drought are much more dismal. Even in such countries, however, the\ndrought is, perhaps, scarce ever so universal as necessarily to occasion a\nfamine, if the government would allow a free trade. The drought in Bengal,\na few years ago, might probably have occasioned a very great dearth. Some\nimproper regulations, some injudicious restraints, imposed by the servants\nof the East India Company upon the rice trade, contributed, perhaps, to\nturn that dearth into a famine.\nWhen the government, in order to remedy the inconveniencies of a dearth,\norders all the dealers to sell their corn at what it supposes a reasonable\nprice, it either hinders them from bringing it to market, which may\nsometimes produce a famine even in the beginning of the season; or, if\nthey bring it thither, it enables the people, and thereby encourages them\nto consume it so fast as must necessarily produce a famine before the end\nof the season. The unlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade, as\nit is the only effectual preventive of the miseries of a famine, so it is\nthe best palliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth; for the\ninconveniencies of a real scarcity cannot be remedied; they can only be\npalliated. No trade deserves more the full protection of the law, and no\ntrade requires it so much; because no trade is so much exposed to popular\nodium.\nIn years of scarcity, the inferior ranks of people impute their distress\nto the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the object of their\nhatred and indignation. Instead of making profit upon such occasions,\ntherefore, he is often in danger of being utterly ruined, and of having\nhis magazines plundered and destroyed by their violence. It is in years of\nscarcity, however, when prices are high, that the corn merchant expects to\nmake his principal profit. He is generally in contract with some farmers\nto furnish him, for a certain number of years, with a certain quantity of\ncorn, at a certain price. This contract price is settled according to what\nis supposed to be the moderate and reasonable, that is, the ordinary or\naverage price, which, before the late years of scarcity, was commonly\nabout 28s. for the quarter of wheat, and for that of other grain in\nproportion. In years of scarcity, therefore, the corn merchant buys a\ngreat part of his corn for the ordinary price, and sells it for a much\nhigher. That this extraordinary profit, however, is no more than\nsufficient to put his trade upon a fair level with other trades, and to\ncompensate the many losses which he sustains upon other occasions, both\nfrom the perishable nature of the commodity itself, and from the frequent\nand unforeseen fluctuations of its price, seems evident enough, from this\nsingle circumstance, that great fortunes are as seldom made in this as in\nany other trade. The popular odium, however, which attends it in years of\nscarcity, the only years in which it can be very profitable, renders\npeople of character and fortune averse to enter into it. It is abandoned\nto an inferior set of dealers; and millers, bakers, meal-men, and\nmeal-factors, together with a number of wretched hucksters, are almost the\nonly middle people that, in the home market, come between the grower and\nthe consumer.\nThe ancient policy of Europe, instead of discountenancing this popular\nodium against a trade so beneficial to the public, seems, on the contrary,\nto have authorised and encouraged it.\nBy the 5th and 6th of Edward VI cap. 14, it was enacted, that whoever\nshould buy any corn or grain, with intent to sell it again, should be\nreputed an unlawful engrosser, and should, for the first fault, suffer two\nmonths imprisonment, and forfeit the value of the corn; for the second,\nsuffer six months imprisonment, and forfeit double the value; and, for the\nthird, be set in the pillory, suffer imprisonment during the king\u2019s\npleasure, and forfeit all his goods and chattels. The ancient policy of\nmost other parts of Europe was no better than that of England.\nOur ancestors seem to have imagined, that the people would buy their corn\ncheaper of the farmer than of the corn merchant, who, they were afraid,\nwould require, over and above the price which he paid to the farmer, an\nexorbitant profit to himself. They endeavoured, therefore, to annihilate\nhis trade altogether. They even endeavoured to hinder, as much as\npossible, any middle man of any kind from coming in between the grower and\nthe consumer; and this was the meaning of the many restraints which they\nimposed upon the trade of those whom they called kidders, or carriers of\ncorn; a trade which nobody was allowed to exercise without a licence,\nascertaining his qualifications as a man of probity and fair dealing. The\nauthority of three justices of the peace was, by the statute of Edward VI.\nnecessary in order to grant this licence. But even this restraint was\nafterwards thought insufficient, and, by a statute of Elizabeth, the\nprivilege of granting it was confined to the quarter-sessions.\nThe ancient policy of Europe endeavoured, in this manner, to regulate\nagriculture, the great trade of the country, by maxims quite different\nfrom those which it established with regard to manufactures, the great\ntrade of the towns. By leaving a farmer no other customers but either the\nconsumers or their immediate factors, the kidders and carriers of corn, it\nendeavoured to force him to exercise the trade, not only of a farmer, but\nof a corn merchant, or corn retailer. On the contrary, it, in many cases,\nprohibited the manufacturer from exercising the trade of a shopkeeper, or\nfrom selling his own goods by retail. It meant, by the one law, to promote\nthe general interest of the country, or to render corn cheap, without,\nperhaps, its being well understood how this was to be done. By the other,\nit meant to promote that of a particular order of men, the shopkeepers,\nwho would be so much undersold by the manufacturer, it was supposed, that\ntheir trade would be ruined, if he was allowed to retail at all.\nThe manufacturer, however, though he had been allowed to keep a shop, and\nto sell his own goods by retail, could not have undersold the common\nshopkeeper. Whatever part of his capital he might have placed in his shop,\nhe must have withdrawn it from his manufacture. In order to carry on his\nbusiness on a level with that of other people, as he must have had the\nprofit of a manufacturer on the one part, so he must have had that of a\nshopkeeper upon the other. Let us suppose, for example, that in the\nparticular town where he lived, ten per cent. was the ordinary profit both\nof manufacturing and shopkeeping stock; he must in this case have charged\nupon every piece of his own goods, which he sold in his shop, a profit of\ntwenty per cent. When he carried them from his workhouse to his shop, he\nmust have valued them at the price for which he could have sold them to a\ndealer or shopkeeper, who would have bought them by wholesale. If he\nvalued them lower, he lost a part of the profit of his manufacturing\ncapital. When, again, he sold them from his shop, unless he got the same\nprice at which a shopkeeper would have sold them, he lost a part of the\nprofit of his shop-keeping capital. Though he might appear, therefore, to\nmake a double profit upon the same piece of goods, yet, as these goods\nmade successively a part of two distinct capitals, he made but a single\nprofit upon the whole capital employed about them; and if he made less\nthan his profit, he was a loser, and did not employ his whole capital with\nthe same advantage as the greater part of his neighbours.\nWhat the manufacturer was prohibited to do, the farmer was in some measure\nenjoined to do; to divide his capital between two different employments;\nto keep one part of it in his granaries and stack-yard, for supplying the\noccasional demands of the market, and to employ the other in the\ncultivation of his land. But as he could not afford to employ the latter\nfor less than the ordinary profits of farming stock, so he could as little\nafford to employ the former for less than the ordinary profits of\nmercantile stock. Whether the stock which really carried on the business\nof a corn merchant belonged to the person who was called a farmer, or to\nthe person who was called a corn merchant, an equal profit was in both\ncases requisite, in order to indemnify its owner for employing it in this\nmanner, in order to put his business on a level with other trades, and in\norder to hinder him from having an interest to change it as soon as\npossible for some other. The farmer, therefore, who was thus forced to\nexercise the trade of a corn merchant, could not afford to sell his corn\ncheaper than any other corn merchant would have been obliged to do in the\ncase of a free competition.\nThe dealer who can employ his whole stock in one single branch of\nbusiness, has an advantage of the same kind with the workman who can\nemploy his whole labour in one single operation. As the latter acquires a\ndexterity which enables him, with the same two hands, to perform a much\ngreater quantity of work, so the former acquires so easy and ready a\nmethod of transacting his business, of buying and disposing of his goods,\nthat with the same capital he can transact a much greater quantity of\nbusiness. As the one can commonly afford his work a good deal cheaper, so\nthe other can commonly afford his goods somewhat cheaper, than if his\nstock and attention were both employed about a greater variety of objects.\nThe greater part of manufacturers could not afford to retail their own\ngoods so cheap as a vigilant and active shopkeeper, whose sole business it\nwas to buy them by wholesale and to retail them again. The greater part of\nfarmers could still less afford to retail their own corn, to supply the\ninhabitants of a town, at perhaps four or five miles distance from the\ngreater part of them, so cheap as a vigilant and active corn merchant,\nwhose sole business it was to purchase corn by wholesale, to collect it\ninto a great magazine, and to retail it again.\nThe law which prohibited the manufacturer from exercising the trade of a\nshopkeeper, endeavoured to force this division in the employment of stock\nto go on faster than it might otherwise have done. The law which obliged\nthe farmer to exercise the trade of a corn merchant, endeavoured to hinder\nit from going on so fast. Both laws were evident violations of natural\nliberty, and therefore unjust; and they were both, too, as impolitic as\nthey were unjust. It is the interest of every society, that things of this\nkind should never either he forced or obstructed. The man who employs\neither his labour or his stock in a greater variety of ways than his\nsituation renders necessary, can never hurt his neighbour by underselling\nhim. He may hurt himself, and he generally does so. Jack-of-all-trades\nwill never be rich, says the proverb. But the law ought always to trust\npeople with the care of their own interest, as in their local situations\nthey must generally be able to judge better of it than the legislature can\ndo. The law, however, which obliged the farmer to exercise the trade of a\ncorn merchant was by far the most pernicious of the two.\nIt obstructed not only that division in the employment of stock which is\nso advantageous to every society, but it obstructed likewise the\nimprovement and cultivation of the land. By obliging the farmer to carry\non two trades instead of one, it forced him to divide his capital into two\nparts, of which one only could be employed in cultivation. But if he had\nbeen at liberty to sell his whole crop to a corn merchant as fast as he\ncould thresh it out, his whole capital might have returned immediately to\nthe land, and have been employed in buying more cattle, and hiring more\nservants, in order to improve and cultivate it better. But by being\nobliged to sell his corn by retail, he was obliged to keep a great part of\nhis capital in his granaries and stack-yard through the year, and could\nnot therefore cultivate so well as with the same capital he might\notherwise have done. This law, therefore, necessarily obstructed the\nimprovement of the land, and, instead of tending to render corn cheaper,\nmust have tended to render it scarcer, and therefore dearer, than it would\notherwise have been.\nAfter the business of the farmer, that of the corn merchant is in reality\nthe trade which, if properly protected and encouraged, would contribute\nthe most to the raising of corn. It would support the trade of the farmer,\nin the same manner as the trade of the wholesale dealer supports that of\nthe manufacturer.\nThe wholesale dealer, by affording a ready market to the manufacturer, by\ntaking his goods off his hand as fast as he can make them, and by\nsometimes even advancing their price to him before he has made them,\nenables him to keep his whole capital, and sometimes even more than his\nwhole capital, constantly employed in manufacturing, and consequently to\nmanufacture a much greater quantity of goods than if he was obliged to\ndispose of them himself to the immediate consumers, or even to the\nretailers. As the capital of the wholesale merchant, too, is generally\nsufficient to replace that of many manufacturers, this intercourse between\nhim and them interests the owner of a large capital to support the owners\nof a great number of small ones, and to assist them in those losses and\nmisfortunes which might otherwise prove ruinous to them.\nAn intercourse of the same kind universally established between the\nfarmers and the corn merchants, would be attended with effects equally\nbeneficial to the farmers. They would be enabled to keep their whole\ncapitals, and even more than their whole capitals constantly employed in\ncultivation. In case of any of those accidents to which no trade is more\nliable than theirs, they would find in their ordinary customer, the\nwealthy corn merchant, a person who had both an interest to support them,\nand the ability to do it; and they would not, as at present, be entirely\ndependent upon the forbearance of their landlord, or the mercy of his\nsteward. Were it possible, as perhaps it is not, to establish this\nintercourse universally, and all at once; were it possible to turn all at\nonce the whole farming stock of the kingdom to its proper business, the\ncultivation of land, withdrawing it from every other employment into which\nany part of it may be at present diverted; and were it possible, in order\nto support and assist, upon occasion, the operations of this great stock,\nto provide all at once another stock almost equally great; it is not,\nperhaps, very easy to imagine how great, how extensive, and how sudden,\nwould be the improvement which this change of circumstances would alone\nproduce upon the whole face of the country.\nThe statute of Edward VI. therefore, by prohibiting as much as possible\nany middle man from coming in between the grower and the consumer,\nendeavoured to annihilate a trade, of which the free exercise is not only\nthe best palliative of the inconveniencies of a dearth, but the best\npreventive of that calamity; after the trade of the farmer, no trade\ncontributing so much to the growing of corn as that of the corn merchant.\nThe rigour of this law was afterwards softened by several subsequent\nstatutes, which successively permitted the engrossing of corn when the\nprice of wheat should not exceed 20s. and 24s. 32s. and 40s. the quarter.\nAt last, by the 15th of Charles II. c.7, the engrossing or buying of corn,\nin order to sell it again, as long as the price of wheat did not exceed\n48s. the quarter, and that of other grain in proportion, was declared\nlawful to all persons not being forestallers, that is, not selling again\nin the same market within three months. All the freedom which the trade of\nthe inland corn dealer has ever yet enjoyed was bestowed upon it by this\nstatute. The statute of the twelfth of the present king, which repeals\nalmost all the other ancient laws against engrossers and forestallers,\ndoes not repeal the restrictions of this particular statute, which\ntherefore still continue in force.\nThis statute, however, authorises in some measure two very absurd popular\nprejudices.\nFirst, It supposes, that when the price of wheat has risen so high as 48s.\nthe quarter, and that of other grain in proportion, corn is likely to be\nso engrossed as to hurt the people. But, from what has been already said,\nit seems evident enough, that corn can at no price be so engrossed by the\ninland dealers as to hurt the people; and 48s. the quarter, besides,\nthough it may be considered as a very high price, yet, in years of\nscarcity, it is a price which frequently takes place immediately after\nharvest, when scarce any part of the new crop can be sold off, and when it\nis impossible even for ignorance to suppose that any part of it can be so\nengrossed as to hurt the people.\nSecondly, It supposes that there is a certain price at which corn is\nlikely to be forestalled, that is, bought up in order to be sold again\nsoon after in the same market, so as to hurt the people. But if a merchant\never buys up corn, either going to a particular market, or in a particular\nmarket, in order to sell it again soon after in the same market, it must\nbe because he judges that the market cannot be so liberally supplied\nthrough the whole season as upon that particular occasion, and that the\nprice, therefore, must soon rise. If he judges wrong in this, and if the\nprice does not rise, he not only loses the whole profit of the stock which\nhe employs in this manner, but a part of the stock itself, by the expense\nand loss which necessarily attend the storing and keeping of corn. He\nhurts himself, therefore, much more essentially than he can hurt even the\nparticular people whom he may hinder from supplying themselves upon that\nparticular market day, because they may afterwards supply themselves just\nas cheap upon any other market day. If he judges right, instead of hurting\nthe great body of the people, he renders them a most important service. By\nmaking them feel the inconveniencies of a dearth somewhat earlier than\nthey otherwise might do, he prevents their feeling them afterwards so\nseverely as they certainly would do, if the cheapness of price encouraged\nthem to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the season. When\nthe scarcity is real, the best thing that can be done for the people is,\nto divide the inconvenience of it as equally as possible, through all the\ndifferent months and weeks and days of the year. The interest of the corn\nmerchant makes him study to do this as exactly as he can; and as no other\nperson can have either the same interest, or the same knowledge, or the\nsame abilities, to do it so exactly as he, this most important operation\nof commerce ought to be trusted entirely to him; or, in other words, the\ncorn trade, so far at least as concerns the supply of the home market,\nought to be left perfectly free.\nThe popular fear of engrossing and forestalling may be compared to the\npopular terrors and suspicions of witchcraft. The unfortunate wretches\naccused of this latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes\nimputed to them, than those who have been accused of the former. The law\nwhich put an end to all prosecutions against witchcraft, which put it out\nof any man\u2019s power to gratify his own malice by accusing his neighbour of\nthat imaginary crime, seems effectually to have put an end to those fears\nand suspicions, by taking away the great cause which encouraged and\nsupported them. The law which would restore entire freedom to the inland\ntrade of corn, would probably prove as effectual to put an end to the\npopular fears of engrossing and forestalling.\nThe 15th of Charles II. c. 7, however, with all its imperfections, has,\nperhaps, contributed more, both to the plentiful supply of the home\nmarket, and to the increase of tillage, than any other law in the statute\nbook. It is from this law that the inland corn trade has derived all the\nliberty and protection which it has ever yet enjoyed; and both the supply\nof the home market and the interest of tillage are much more effectually\npromoted by the inland, than either by the importation or exportation\ntrade.\nThe proportion of the average quantity of all sorts of grain imported into\nGreat Britain to that of all sorts of grain consumed, it has been computed\nby the author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, does not exceed that of\none to five hundred and seventy. For supplying the home market, therefore,\nthe importance of the inland trade must be to that of the importation\ntrade as five hundred and seventy to one.\nThe average quantity of all sorts of grain exported from Great Britain\ndoes not, according to the same author, exceed the one-and-thirtieth part\nof the annual produce. For the encouragement of tillage, therefore, by\nproviding a market for the home produce, the importance of the inland\ntrade must be to that of the exportation trade as thirty to one.\nI have no great faith in political arithmetic, and I mean not to warrant\nthe exactness of either of these computations. I mention them only in\norder to show of how much less consequence, in the opinion of the most\njudicious and experienced persons, the foreign trade of corn is than the\nhome trade. The great cheapness of corn in the years immediately preceding\nthe establishment of the bounty may, perhaps with reason, he ascribed in\nsome measure to the operation of this statute of Charles II. which had\nbeen enacted about five-and-twenty years before, and which had, therefore,\nfull time to produce its effect.\nA very few words will sufficiently explain all that I have to say\nconcerning the other three branches of the corn trade.\nII. The trade of the merchant-importer of foreign corn for home\nconsumption, evidently contributes to the immediate supply of the home\nmarket, and must so far be immediately beneficial to the great body of the\npeople. It tends, indeed, to lower somewhat the average money price of\ncorn, but not to diminish its real value, or the quantity of labour which\nit is capable of maintaining. If importation was at all times free, our\nfarmers and country gentlemen would probably, one year with another, get\nless money for their corn than they do at present, when importation is at\nmost times in effect prohibited; but the money which they got would be of\nmore value, would buy more goods of all other kinds, and would employ more\nlabour. Their real wealth, their real revenue, therefore, would be the\nsame as at present, though it might be expressed by a smaller quantity of\nsilver, and they would neither be disabled nor discouraged from\ncultivating corn as much as they do at present. On the contrary, as the\nrise in the real value of silver, in consequence of lowering the money\nprice of corn, lowers somewhat the money price of all other commodities,\nit gives the industry of the country where it takes place some advantage\nin all foreign markets and thereby tends to encourage and increase that\nindustry. But the extent of the home market for corn must be in proportion\nto the general industry of the country where it grows, or to the number of\nthose who produce something else, and therefore, have something else, or,\nwhat comes to the same thing, the price of something else, to give in\nexchange for corn. But in every country, the home market, as it is the\nnearest and most convenient, so is it likewise the greatest and most\nimportant market for corn. That rise in the real value of silver,\ntherefore, which is the effect of lowering the average money price of\ncorn, tends to enlarge the greatest and most important market for corn,\nand thereby to encourage, instead of discouraging its growth.\nBy the 22d of Charles II. c. 13, the importation of wheat, whenever the\nprice in the home market did not exceed 53s:4d. the quarter, was subjected\nto a duty of 16s. the quarter; and to a duty of 8s. whenever the price did\nnot exceed \u00a34. The former of these two prices has, for more than a century\npast, taken place only in times of very great scarcity; and the latter\nhas, so far as I know, not taken place at all. Yet, till wheat has risen\nabove this latter price, it was, by this statute, subjected to a very high\nduty; and, till it had risen above the former, to a duty which amounted to\na prohibition. The importation of other sorts of grain was restrained at\nrates and by duties, in proportion to the value of the grain, almost\nequally high. Before the 13th of the present king, the following were the\nduties payable upon the importation of the different sorts of grain:\nGrain.                     Duties.          Duties       Duties.\nBeans to 28s. per qr.  19s:10d. after till 40s. 16s:8d. then 12d.\nBarley to 28s.   -     19s:10d.         -  32s. 16s.     -   12d.\nMalt is prohibited by the annual malt-tax bill.\nOats   to 16s.   -      5s:10d. after   -                    9\u00bdd.\nPease   to 40s.  -     16s: 0d. after   -                    9\u00bed.\nRye     to 36s.  -     19s:10d. till 40s.       16s:8d   -   12d.\nWheat to 44s.    -     21s: 9d. till 53s:4d.    17s.     -    8s.\ntill \u00a34, and after that about       1s:4d.\nBuck-wheat to 32s. per qr.     to pay 16s.\nThese different duties were imposed, partly by the 22d of Charles II. in\nplace of the old subsidy, partly by the new subsidy, by the one-third and\ntwo-thirds subsidy, and by the subsidy 1747. Subsequent laws still further\nincreased those duties.\nThe distress which, in years of scarcity, the strict execution of those\nlaws might have brought upon the people, would probably have been very\ngreat; but, upon such occasions, its execution was generally suspended by\ntemporary statutes, which permitted, for a limited time, the importation\nof foreign corn. The necessity of these temporary statutes sufficiently\ndemonstrates the impropriety of this general one.\nThese restraints upon importation, though prior to the establishment of\nthe bounty, were dictated by the same spirit, by the same principles,\nwhich afterwards enacted that regulation. How hurtful soever in\nthemselves, these, or some other restraints upon importation, became\nnecessary in consequence of that regulation. If, when wheat was either\nbelow 48s. the quarter, or not much above it, foreign corn could have been\nimported, either duty free, or upon paying only a small duty, it might\nhave been exported again, with the benefit of the bounty, to the great\nloss of the public revenue, and to the entire perversion of the\ninstitution, of which the object was to extend the market for the home\ngrowth, not that for the growth of foreign countries.\nIII. The trade of the merchant-exporter of corn for foreign consumption,\ncertainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful supply of the home\nmarket. It does so, however, indirectly. From whatever source this supply\nmaybe usually drawn, whether from home growth, or from foreign\nimportation, unless more corn is either usually grown, or usually imported\ninto the country, than what is usually consumed in it, the supply of the\nhome market can never be very plentiful. But unless the surplus can, in\nall ordinary cases, be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow\nmore, and the importers never to import more, than what the bare\nconsumption of the home market requires. That market will very seldom be\noverstocked; but it will generally be understocked; the people, whose\nbusiness it is to supply it, being generally afraid lest their goods\nshould be left upon their hands. The prohibition of exportation limits the\nimprovement and cultivation of the country to what the supply of its own\ninhabitants require. The freedom of exportation enables it to extend\ncultivation for the supply of foreign nations.\nBy the 12th of Charles II. c.4, the exportation of corn was permitted\nwhenever the price of wheat did not exceed 40s. the quarter, and that of\nother grain in proportion. By the 15th of the same prince, this liberty\nwas extended till the price of wheat exceeded 48s. the quarter; and by the\n22d, to all higher prices. A poundage, indeed, was to be paid to the king\nupon such exportation; but all grain was rated so low in the book of\nrates, that this poundage amounted only, upon wheat to 1s., upon oats to\n4d., and upon all other grain to 6d. the quarter. By the 1st of William\nand Mary, the act which established this bounty, this small duty was\nvirtually taken off whenever the price of wheat did not exceed 48s. the\nquarter; and by the 11th and 12th of William III. c. 20, it was expressly\ntaken off at all higher prices.\nThe trade of the merchant-exporter was, in this manner, not only\nencouraged by a bounty, but rendered much more free than that of the\ninland dealer. By the last of these statutes, corn could be engrossed at\nany price for exportation; but it could not be engrossed for inland sale,\nexcept when the price did not exceed 48s. the quarter. The interest of the\ninland dealer, however, it has already been shown, can never be opposite\nto that of the great body of the people. That of the merchant-exporter\nmay, and in fact sometimes is. If, while his own country labours under a\ndearth, a neighbouring country should be afflicted with a famine, it might\nbe his interest to carry corn to the latter country, in such quantities as\nmight very much aggravate the calamities of the dearth. The plentiful\nsupply of the home market was not the direct object of those statutes;\nbut, under the pretence of encouraging agriculture, to raise the money\nprice of corn as high as possible, and thereby to occasion, as much as\npossible, a constant dearth in the home market. By the discouragement of\nimportation, the supply of that market; even in times of great scarcity,\nwas confined to the home growth; and by the encouragement of exportation,\nwhen the price was so high as 48s. the quarter, that market was not, even\nin times of considerable scarcity, allowed to enjoy the whole of that\ngrowth. The temporary laws, prohibiting, for a limited time, the\nexportation of corn, and taking off, for a limited time, the duties upon\nits importation, expedients to which Great Britain has been obliged so\nfrequently to have recourse, sufficiently demonstrate the impropriety of\nher general system. Had that system been good, she would not so frequently\nhave been reduced to the necessity of departing from it.\nWere all nations to follow the liberal system of free exportation and free\nimportation, the different states into which a great continent was\ndivided, would so far resemble the different provinces of a great empire.\nAs among the different provinces of a great empire, the freedom of the\ninland trade appears, both from reason and experience, not only the best\npalliative of a dearth, but the most effectual preventive of a famine; so\nwould the freedom of the exportation and importation trade be among the\ndifferent states into which a great continent was divided. The larger the\ncontinent, the easier the communication through all the different parts of\nit, both by land and by water, the less would any one particular part of\nit ever be exposed to either of these calamities, the scarcity of any one\ncountry being more likely to be relieved by the plenty of some other. But\nvery few countries have entirely adopted this liberal system. The freedom\nof the corn trade is almost everywhere more or less restrained, and in\nmany countries is confined by such absurd regulations, as frequently\naggravate the unavoidable misfortune of a dearth into the dreadful\ncalamity of a famine. The demand of such countries for corn may frequently\nbecome so great and so urgent, that a small state in their neighbourhood,\nwhich happened at the same time to be labouring under some degree of\ndearth, could not venture to supply them without exposing itself to the\nlike dreadful calamity. The very bad policy of one country may thus render\nit, in some measure, dangerous and imprudent to establish what would\notherwise be the best policy in another. The unlimited freedom of\nexportation, however, would be much less dangerous in great states, in\nwhich the growth being much greater, the supply could seldom be much\naffected by any quantity or corn that was likely to be exported. In a\nSwiss canton, or in some of the little states in Italy, it may, perhaps,\nsometimes be necessary to restrain the exportation of corn. In such great\ncountries as France or England, it scarce ever can. To hinder, besides,\nthe farmer from sending his goods at all times to the best market, is\nevidently to sacrifice the ordinary laws of justice to an idea of public\nutility, to a sort of reasons of state; an act or legislative authority\nwhich ought to be exercised only, which can be pardoned only, in cases of\nthe most urgent necessity. The price at which exportation of corn is\nprohibited, if it is ever to be prohibited, ought always to be a very high\nprice.\nThe laws concerning corn may everywhere be compared to the laws concerning\nreligion. The people feel themselves so much interested in what relates\neither to their subsistence in this life, or to their happiness in a life\nto come, that government must yield to their prejudices, and, in order to\npreserve the public tranquillity, establish that system which they approve\nof. It is upon this account, perhaps, that we so seldom find a reasonable\nsystem established with regard to either of those two capital objects.\nIV. The trade of the merchant-carrier, or of the importer of foreign corn,\nin order to export it again, contributes to the plentiful supply of the\nhome market. It is not, indeed, the direct purpose of his trade to sell\nhis corn there; but he will generally be willing to do so, and even for a\ngood deal less money than he might expect in a foreign market; because he\nsaves in this manner the expense of loading and unloading, of freight and\ninsurance. The inhabitants of the country which, by means of the carrying\ntrade, becomes the magazine and storehouse for the supply of other\ncountries, can very seldom be in want themselves. Though the carrying\ntrade must thus contribute to reduce the average money price of corn in\nthe home market, it would not thereby lower its real value; it would only\nraise somewhat the real value of silver.\nThe carrying trade was in effect prohibited in Great Britain, upon all\nordinary occasions, by the high duties upon the importation of foreign\ncorn, of the greater part of which there was no drawback; and upon\nextraordinary occasions, when a scarcity made it necessary to suspend\nthose duties by temporary statutes, exportation was always prohibited. By\nthis system of laws, therefore, the carrying trade was in effect\nprohibited.\nThat system of laws, therefore, which is connected with the establishment\nof the bounty, seems to deserve no part of the praise which has been\nbestowed upon it. The improvement and prosperity of Great Britain, which\nhas been so often ascribed to those laws, may very easily be accounted for\nby other causes. That security which the laws in Great Britain give to\nevery man, that he shall enjoy the fruits of his own labour, is alone\nsufficient to make any country flourish, notwithstanding these and twenty\nother absurd regulations of commerce; and this security was perfected by\nthe Revolution, much about the same time that the bounty was established.\nThe natural effort of every individual to better his own condition, when\nsuffered to exert itself with freedom and security, is so powerful a\nprinciple, that it is alone, and without any assistance, not only capable\nof carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a\nhundred impertinent obstructions, with which the folly of human laws too\noften encumbers its operations: though the effect of those obstructions is\nalways, more or less, either to encroach upon its freedom, or to diminish\nits security. In Great Britain industry is perfectly secure; and though it\nis far from being perfectly free, it is as free or freer than in any other\npart of Europe.\nThough the period of the greatest prosperity and improvement of Great\nBritain has been posterior to that system of laws which is connected with\nthe bounty, we must not upon that account, impute it to those laws. It has\nbeen posterior likewise to the national debt; but the national debt has\nmost assuredly not been the cause of it.\nThough the system of laws which is connected with the bounty, has exactly\nthe same tendency with the practice of Spain and Portugal, to lower\nsomewhat the value of the precious metals in the country where it takes\nplace; yet Great Britain is certainly one of the richest countries in\nEurope, while Spain and Portugal are perhaps amongst the most beggarly.\nThis difference of situation, however, may easily be accounted for from\ntwo different causes. First, the tax in Spain, the prohibition in Portugal\nof exporting gold and silver, and the vigilant police which watches over\nthe execution of those laws, must, in two very poor countries, which\nbetween them import annually upwards of six millions sterling, operate not\nonly more directly, but much more forcibly, in reducing the value of those\nmetals there, than the corn laws can do in Great Britain. And, secondly,\nthis bad policy is not in those countries counterbalanced by the general\nliberty and security of the people. Industry is there neither free nor\nsecure; and the civil and ecclesiastical governments of both Spain and\nPortugal are such as would alone be sufficient to perpetuate their present\nstate of poverty, even though their regulations of commerce were as wise\nas the greatest part of them are absurd and foolish.\nThe 13th of the present king, c. 43, seems to have established a new\nsystem with regard to the corn laws, in many respects better than the\nancient one, but in one or two respects perhaps not quite so good.\nBy this statute, the high duties upon importation for home consumption are\ntaken off, so soon as the price of middling wheat rises to 48s. the\nquarter; that of middling rye, pease, or beans, to 32s.; that of barley to\n24s.; and that of oats to 16s.; and instead of them, a small duty is\nimposed of only 6d upon the quarter of wheat, and upon that or other grain\nin proportion. With regard to all those different sorts of grain, but\nparticularly with regard to wheat, the home market is thus opened to\nforeign supplies, at prices considerably lower than before.\nBy the same statute, the old bounty of 5s. upon the exportation of wheat,\nceases so soon as the price rises to 44s. the quarter, instead of 48s. the\nprice at which it ceased before; that of 2s:6d. upon the exportation of\nbarley, ceases so soon as the price rises to 22s. instead of 24s. the\nprice at which it ceased before; that of 2s:6d. upon the exportation of\noatmeal, ceases so soon as the price rises to 14s. instead of 15s. the\nprice at which it ceased before. The bounty upon rye is reduced from\n3s:6d. to 3s. and it ceases so soon as the price rises to 28s. instead of\n32s. the price at which it ceased before. If bounties are as improper as I\nhave endeavoured to prove them to be, the sooner they cease, and the lower\nthey are, so much the better.\nThe same statute permits, at the lowest prices, the importation of corn in\norder to be exported again, duty free, provided it is in the mean time\nlodged in a warehouse under the joint locks of the king and the importer.\nThis liberty, indeed, extends to no more than twenty-five of the different\nports of Great Britain. They are, however, the principal ones; and there\nmay not, perhaps, be warehouses proper for this purpose in the greater\npart of the others.\nSo far this law seems evidently an improvement upon the ancient system.\nBut by the same law, a bounty of 2s. the quarter is given for the\nexportation of oats, whenever the price does not exceed fourteen\nshillings. No bounty had ever been given before for the exportation of\nthis grain, no more than for that of pease or beans.\nBy the same law, too, the exportation of wheat is prohibited so soon as\nthe price rises to forty-four shillings the quarter; that of rye so soon\nas it rises to twenty-eight shillings; that of barley so soon as it rises\nto twenty-two shillings; and that of oats so soon as they rise to fourteen\nshillings. Those several prices seem all of them a good deal too low; and\nthere seems to be an impropriety, besides, in prohibiting exportation\naltogether at those precise prices at which that bounty, which was given\nin order to force it, is withdrawn. The bounty ought certainly either to\nhave been withdrawn at a much lower price, or exportation ought to have\nbeen allowed at a much higher.\nSo far, therefore, this law seems to be inferior to the ancient system.\nWith all its imperfections, however, we may perhaps say of it what was\nsaid of the laws of Solon, that though not the best in itself, it is the\nbest which the interest, prejudices, and temper of the times, would admit\nof. It may perhaps in due time prepare the way for a better.\nCHAPTER VI.\nOF TREATIES OF COMMERCE.\nWhen a nation binds itself by treaty, either to permit the entry of\ncertain goods from one foreign country which it prohibits from all others,\nor to exempt the goods of one country from duties to which it subjects\nthose of all others, the country, or at least the merchants and\nmanufacturers of the country, whose commerce is so favoured, must\nnecessarily derive great advantage from the treaty. Those merchants and\nmanufacturers enjoy a sort of monopoly in the country which is so\nindulgent to them. That country becomes a market, both more extensive and\nmore advantageous for their goods: more extensive, because the goods of\nother nations being either excluded or subjected to heavier duties, it\ntakes off a greater quantity of theirs; more advantageous, because the\nmerchants of the favoured country, enjoying a sort of monopoly there, will\noften sell their goods for a better price than if exposed to the free\ncompetition of all other nations.\nSuch treaties, however, though they may be advantageous to the merchants\nand manufacturers of the favoured, are necessarily disadvantageous to\nthose of the favouring country. A monopoly is thus granted against them to\na foreign nation; and they must frequently buy the foreign goods they have\noccasion for, dearer than if the free competition of other nations was\nadmitted. That part of its own produce with which such a nation purchases\nforeign goods, must consequently be sold cheaper; because, when two things\nare exchanged for one another, the cheapness of the one is a necessary\nconsequence, or rather is the same thing, with the dearness of the other.\nThe exchangeable value of its annual produce, therefore, is likely to be\ndiminished by every such treaty. This diminution, however, can scarce\namount to any positive loss, but only to a lessening of the gain which it\nmight otherwise make. Though it sells its goods cheaper than it otherwise\nmight do, it will not probably sell them for less than they cost; nor, as\nin the case of bounties, for a price which will not replace the capital\nemployed in bringing them to market, together with the ordinary profits of\nstock. The trade could not go on long if it did. Even the favouring\ncountry, therefore, may still gain by the trade, though less than if there\nwas a free competition.\nSome treaties of commerce, however, have been supposed advantageous, upon\nprinciples very different from these; and a commercial country has\nsometimes granted a monopoly of this kind, against itself, to certain\ngoods of a foreign nation, because it expected, that in the whole commerce\nbetween them, it would annually sell more than it would buy, and that a\nbalance in gold and silver would be annually returned to it. It is upon\nthis principle that the treaty of commerce between England and Portugal,\nconcluded in 1703 by Mr Methuen, has been so much commended. The following\nis a literal translation of that treaty, which consists of three articles\nonly.\nART. I. His sacred royal majesty of Portugal promises, both in his own\nname and that of his successors, to admit for ever hereafter, into\nPortugal, the woollen cloths, and the rest of the woollen manufactures of\nthe British, as was accustomed, till they were prohibited by the law;\nnevertheless upon this condition:\nART. II. That is to say, that her sacred royal majesty of Great Britain\nshall, in her own name, and that of her successors, be obliged, for ever\nhereafter, to admit the wines of the growth of Portugal into Britain; so\nthat at no time, whether there shall be peace or war between the kingdoms\nof Britain and France, any thing more shall be demanded for these wines by\nthe name of custom or duty, or by whatsoever other title, directly or\nindirectly, whether they shall be imported into Great Britain in pipes or\nhogsheads, or other casks, than what shall be demanded for the like\nquantity or measure of French wine, deducting or abating a third part of\nthe custom or duty. But if, at any time, this deduction or abatement of\ncustoms, which is to be made as aforesaid, shall in any manner be\nattempted and prejudiced, it shall be just and lawful for his sacred royal\nmajesty of Portugal, again to prohibit the woollen cloths, and the rest of\nthe British woollen manufactures.\nART. III. The most excellent lords the plenipotentiaries promise and take\nupon themselves, that their above named masters shall ratify this treaty;\nand within the space of two months the ratification shall be exchanged.\nBy this treaty, the crown of Portugal becomes bound to admit the English\nwoollens upon the same footing as before the prohibition; that is, not to\nraise the duties which had been paid before that time. But it does not\nbecome bound to admit them upon any better terms than those of any other\nnation, of France or Holland, for example. The crown of Great Britain, on\nthe contrary, becomes bound to admit the wines of Portugal, upon paying\nonly two-thirds of the duty which is paid for those of France, the wines\nmost likely to come into competition with them. So far this treaty,\ntherefore, is evidently advantageous to Portugal, and disadvantageous to\nGreat Britain.\nIt has been celebrated, however, as a masterpiece of the commercial policy\nof England. Portugal receives annually from the Brazils a greater quantity\nof gold than can be employed in its domestic commerce, whether in the\nshape of coin or of plate. The surplus is too valuable to be allowed to\nlie idle and locked up in coffers; and as it can find no advantageous\nmarket at home, it must, notwithstanding; any prohibition, be sent abroad,\nand exchanged for something for which there is a more advantageous market\nat home. A large share of it comes annually to England, in return either\nfor English goods, or for those of other European nations that receive\ntheir returns through England. Mr Barretti was informed, that the weekly\npacket-boat from Lisbon brings, one week with another, more than \u00a350,000\nin gold to England. The sum had probably been exaggerated. It would amount\nto more than \u00a32,600,000 a year, which is more than the Brazils are\nsupposed to afford.\nOur merchants were, some years ago, out of humour with the crown of\nPortugal. Some privileges which had been granted them, not by treaty, but\nby the free grace of that crown, at the solicitation, indeed, it is\nprobable, and in return for much greater favours, defence and protection\nfrom the crown of Great Britain, had been either infringed or revoked. The\npeople, therefore, usually most interested in celebrating the Portugal\ntrade, were then rather disposed to represent it as less advantageous than\nit had commonly been imagined. The far greater part, almost the whole,\nthey pretended, of this annual importation of gold, was not on account of\nGreat Britain, but of other European nations; the fruits and wines of\nPortugal annually imported into Great Britain nearly compensating the\nvalue of the British goods sent thither.\nLet us suppose, however, that the whole was on account of Great Britain,\nand that it amounted to a still greater sum than Mr Barretti seems to\nimagine; this trade would not, upon that account, be more advantageous\nthan any other, in which, for the same value sent out, we received an\nequal value of consumable goods in return.\nIt is but a very small part of this importation which, it can be supposed,\nis employed as an annual addition, either to the plate or to the coin of\nthe kingdom. The rest must all be sent abroad, and exchanged for\nconsumable goods of some kind or other. But if those consumable goods were\npurchased directly with the produce of English industry, it would be more\nfor the advantage of England, than first to purchase with that produce the\ngold of Portugal, and afterwards to purchase with that gold those\nconsumable goods. A direct foreign trade of consumption is always more\nadvantageous than a round-about one; and to bring the same value of\nforeign goods to the home market requires a much smaller capital in the\none way than in the ether. If a smaller share of its industry, therefore,\nhad been employed in producing goods fit for the Portugal market, and a\ngreater in producing those lit for the other markets, where those\nconsumable goods for which there is a demand in Great Britain are to be\nhad, it would have been more for the advantage of England. To procure both\nthe gold which it wants for its own use, and the consumable goods, would,\nin this way, employ a much smaller capital than at present. There would be\na spare capital, therefore, to be employed for other purposes, in exciting\nan additional quantity of industry, and in raising a greater annual\nproduce.\nThough Britain were entirely excluded from the Portugal trade, it could\nfind very little difficulty in procuring all the annual supplies of gold\nwhich it wants, either for the purposes of plate, or of coin, or of\nforeign trade. Gold, like every other commodity, is always somewhere or\nanother to be got for its value by those who have that value to give for\nit. The annual surplus of gold in Portugal, besides, would still be sent\nabroad, and though not carried away by Great Britain, would be carried\naway by some other nation, which would be glad to sell it again for its\nprice, in the same manner as Great Britain does at present. In buying gold\nof Portugal, indeed, we buy it at the first hand; whereas, in buying it of\nany other nation, except Spain, we should buy it at the second, and might\npay somewhat dearer. This difference, however, would surely be too\ninsignificant to deserve the public attention.\nAlmost all our gold, it is said, comes from Portugal. With other nations,\nthe balance of trade is either against as, or not much in our favour. But\nwe should remember, that the more gold we import from one country, the\nless we must necessarily import from all others. The effectual demand for\ngold, like that for every other commodity, is in every country limited to\na certain quantity. If nine-tenths of this quantity are imported from one\ncountry, there remains a tenth only to be imported from all others. The\nmore gold, besides, that is annually imported from some particular\ncountries, over and above what is requisite for plate and for coin, the\nmore must necessarily be exported to some others: and the more that most\ninsignificant object of modern policy, the balance of trade, appears to be\nin our favour with some particular countries, the more it must necessarily\nappear to be against us with many others.\nIt was upon this silly notion, however, that England could not subsist\nwithout the Portugal trade, that, towards the end of the late war, France\nand Spain, without pretending either offence or provocation, required the\nking of Portugal to exclude all British ships from his ports, and, for the\nsecurity of this exclusion, to receive into them French or Spanish\ngarrisons. Had the king of Portugal submitted to those ignominious terms\nwhich his brother-in-law the king of Spain proposed to him, Britain would\nhave been freed from a much greater inconveniency than the loss of the\nPortugal trade, the burden of supporting a very weak ally, so unprovided\nof every thing for his own defence, that the whole power of England, had\nit been directed to that single purpose, could scarce, perhaps, have\ndefended him for another campaign. The loss of the Portugal trade would,\nno doubt, have occasioned a considerable embarrassment to the merchants at\nthat time engaged in it, who might not, perhaps, have found out, for a\nyear or two, any other equally advantageous method of employing their\ncapitals; and in this would probably have consisted all the inconveniency\nwhich England could have suffered from this notable piece of commercial\npolicy.\nThe great annual importation of gold and silver is neither for the purpose\nof plate nor of coin, but of foreign trade. A round-about foreign trade of\nconsumption can be carried on more advantageously by means of these metals\nthan of almost any other goods. As they are the universal instruments of\ncommerce, they are more readily received in return for all commodities\nthan any other goods; and, on account of their small bulk and great value,\nit costs less to transport them backward and forward from one place to\nanother than almost any other sort of merchandize, and they lose less of\ntheir value by being so transported. Of all the commodities, therefore,\nwhich are bought in one foreign country, for no other purpose but to be\nsold or exchanged again for some other goods in another, there are none so\nconvenient as gold and silver. In facilitating all the different\nround-about foreign trades of consumption which are carried on in Great\nBritain, consists the principal advantage of the Portugal trade; and\nthough it is not a capital advantage, it is, no doubt, a considerable one.\nThat any annual addition which, it can reasonably be supposed, is made\neither to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom, could require but a\nvery small annual importation of gold and silver, seems evident enough;\nand though we had no direct trade with Portugal, this small quantity could\nalways, somewhere or another, be very easily got.\nThough the goldsmiths trade be very considerable in Great Britain, the far\ngreater part of the new plate which they annually sell, is made from other\nold plate melted down; so that the addition annually made to the whole\nplate of the kingdom cannot be very great, and could require but a very\nsmall annual importation.\nIt is the same case with the coin. Nobody imagines, I believe, that even\nthe greater part of the annual coinage, amounting, for ten years together,\nbefore the late reformation of the gold coin, to upwards of \u00a3800,000\na-year in gold, was an annual addition to the money before current in the\nkingdom. In a country where the expense of the coinage is defrayed by the\ngovernment, the value of the coin, even when it contains its full standard\nweight of gold and silver, can never be much greater than that of an equal\nquantity of those metals uncoined, because it requires only the trouble of\ngoing to the mint, and the delay, perhaps, of a few weeks, to procure for\nany quantity of uncoined gold and silver an equal quantity of those metals\nin coin; but in every country the greater part of the current coin is\nalmost always more or less worn, or otherwise degenerated from its\nstandard. In Great Britain it was, before the late reformation, a good\ndeal so, the gold being more than two per cent., and the silver more than\neight per cent. below its standard weight. But if forty-four guineas and\na-half, containing their full standard weight, a pound weight of gold,\ncould purchase very little more than a pound weight of uncoined gold;\nforty-four guineas and a-half, wanting a part of their weight, could not\npurchase a pound weight, and something was to be added, in order to make\nup the deficiency. The current price of gold bullion at market, therefore,\ninstead of being the same with the mint price, or \u00a346:14:6, was then about\n\u00a347:14s., and sometimes about \u00a348. When the greater part of the coin,\nhowever, was in this degenerate condition, forty four guineas and a-half,\nfresh from the mint, would purchase no more goods in the market than any\nother ordinary guineas; because, when they came into the coffers of the\nmerchant, being confounded with other money, they could not afterwards be\ndistinguished without more trouble than the difference was worth. Like\nother guineas, they were worth no more than \u00a346:14:6. If thrown into the\nmelting pot, however, they produced, without any sensible loss, a pound\nweight of standard gold, which could be sold at any time for between\n\u00a347:14s. and \u00a348, either in gold or silver, as fit for all the purposes of\ncoin as that which had been melted down. There was an evident profit,\ntherefore, in melting down new-coined money; and it was done so\ninstantaneously, that no precaution of government could prevent it. The\noperations of the mint were, upon this account, somewhat like the web of\nPenelope; the work that was done in the day was undone in the night. The\nmint was employed, not so much in making daily additions to the coin, as\nin replacing the very best part of it, which was daily melted down.\nWere the private people who carry their gold and silver to the mint to pay\nthemselves for the coinage, it would add to the value of those metals, in\nthe same manner as the fashion does to that of plate. Coined gold and\nsilver would be more valuable than uncoined. The seignorage, if it was not\nexorbitant, would add to the bullion the whole value of the duty; because,\nthe government having everywhere the exclusive privilege of coining, no\ncoin can come to market cheaper than they think proper to afford it. If\nthe duty was exorbitant, indeed, that is, if it was very much above the\nreal value of the labour and expense requisite for coinage, false coiners,\nboth at home and abroad, might be encouraged, by the great difference\nbetween the value of bullion and that of coin, to pour in so great a\nquantity of counterfeit money as might reduce the value of the government\nmoney. In France, however, though the seignorage is eight per cent., no\nsensible inconveniency of this kind is found to arise from it. The dangers\nto which a false coiner is everywhere exposed, if he lives in the country\nof which he counterfeits the coin, and to which his agents or\ncorrespondents are exposed, if he lives in a foreign country, are by far\ntoo great to be incurred for the sake of a profit of six or seven per\ncent.\nThe seignorage in France raises the value of the coin higher than in\nproportion to the quantity of pure gold which it contains. Thus, by the\nedict of January 1726, the mint price of fine gold of twenty-four carats\nwas fixed at seven hundred and forty livres nine sous and one denier\none-eleventh the mark of eight Paris ounces. {See Dictionnaire des\nMonnoies, tom. ii. article Seigneurage, p. 439, par 81. Abbot de\nBazinghen, Conseiller-Commissaire en la Cour des Monnoies \u00e0 Paris.} The\ngold coin of France, making an allowance for the remedy of the mint,\ncontains twenty-one carats and three-fourths of fine gold, and two carats\none-fourth of alloy. The mark of standard gold, therefore, is worth no\nmore than about six hundred and seventy-one livres ten deniers. But in\nFrance this mark of standard gold is coined into thirty louis d\u2019ors of\ntwenty-four livres each, or into seven hundred and twenty livres. The\ncoinage, therefore, increases the value of a mark of standard gold\nbullion, by the difference between six hundred and seventy-one livres ten\ndeniers and seven hundred and twenty livres, or by forty-eight livres\nnineteen sous and two deniers.\nA seignorage will, in many cases, take away altogether, and will in all\ncases diminish, the profit of melting down the new coin. This profit\nalways arises from the difference between the quantity of bullion which\nthe common currency ought to contain and that which it actually does\ncontain. If this difference is less than the seignorage, there will be\nloss instead of profit. If it is equal to the seignorage, there will be\nneither profit nor loss. If it is greater than the seignorage, there will,\nindeed, be some profit, but less than if there was no seignorage. If,\nbefore the late reformation of the gold coin, for example, there had been\na seignorage of five per cent. upon the coinage, there would have been a\nloss of three per cent. upon the melting down of the gold coin. If the\nseignorage had been two per cent., there would have been neither profit\nnor loss. If the seignorage had been one per cent., there would have been\na profit but of one per cent. only, instead of two per cent. Wherever\nmoney is received by tale, therefore, and not by weight, a seignorage is\nthe most effectual preventive of the melting down of the coin, and, for\nthe same reason, of its exportation. It is the best and heaviest pieces\nthat are commonly either melted down or exported, because it is upon such\nthat the largest profits are made.\nThe law for the encouragement of the coinage, by rendering it duty-free,\nwas first enacted during the reign of Charles II. for a limited time, and\nafterwards continued, by different prolongations, till 1769, when it was\nrendered perpetual. The bank of England, in order to replenish their\ncoffers with money, are frequently obliged to carry bullion to the mint;\nand it was more for their interest, they probably imagined, that the\ncoinage should be at the expense of the government than at their own. It\nwas probably out of complaisance to this great company, that the\ngovernment agreed to render this law perpetual. Should the custom of\nweighing gold, however, come to be disused, as it is very likely to be on\naccount of its inconveniency; should the gold coin of England come to be\nreceived by tale, as it was before the late recoinage this great company\nmay, perhaps, find that they have, upon this, as upon some other\noccasions, mistaken their own interest not a little.\nBefore the late recoinage, when the gold currency of England was two per\ncent. below its standard weight, as there was no seignorage, it was two\nper cent. below the value of that quantity of standard gold bullion which\nit ought to have contained. When this great company, therefore, bought\ngold bullion in order to have it coined, they were obliged to pay for it\ntwo per cent. more than it was worth after the coinage. But if there had\nbeen a seignorage of two per cent. upon the coinage, the common gold\ncurrency, though two per cent. below its standard weight, would,\nnotwithstanding, have been equal in value to the quantity of standard gold\nwhich it ought to have contained; the value of the fashion compensating in\nthis case the diminution of the weight. They would, indeed, have had the\nseignorage to pay, which being two per cent., their loss upon the whole\ntransaction would have been two per cent., exactly the same, but no\ngreater than it actually was.\nIf the seignorage had been five per cent. and the gold currency only two\nper cent. below its standard weight, the bank would, in this case, have\ngained three per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they would\nhave had a seignorage of five per cent. to pay upon the coinage, their\nloss upon the whole transaction would, in the same manner, have been\nexactly two per cent.\nIf the seignorage had been only one per cent., and the gold currency two\nper cent. below its standard weight, the bank would, in this case, have\nlost only one per cent. upon the price of the bullion; but as they would\nlikewise have had a seignorage of one per cent. to pay, their loss upon\nthe whole transaction would have been exactly two per cent., in the same\nmanner as in all other cases.\nIf there was a reasonable seignorage, while at the same time the coin\ncontained its full standard weight, as it has done very nearly since the\nlate recoinage, whatever the bank might lose by the seignorage, they would\ngain upon the price of the bullion; and whatever they might gain upon the\nprice of the bullion, they would lose by the seignorage. They would\nneither lose nor gain, therefore, upon the whole transaction, and they\nwould in this, as in all the foregoing cases, be exactly in the same\nsituation as if there was no seignorage.\nWhen the tax upon a commodity is so moderate as not to encourage\nsmuggling, the merchant who deals in it, though he advances, does not\nproperly pay the tax, as he gets it back in the price of the commodity.\nThe tax is finally paid by the last purchaser or consumer. But money is a\ncommodity, with regard to which every man is a merchant. Nobody buys it\nbut in order to sell it again; and with regard to it there is, in ordinary\ncases, no last purchaser or consumer. When the tax upon coinage,\ntherefore, is so moderate as not to encourage false coining, though every\nbody advances the tax, nobody finally pays it; because every body gets it\nback in the advanced value of the coin.\nA moderate seignorage, therefore, would not, in any case, augment the\nexpense of the bank, or of any other private persons who carry their\nbullion to the mint in order to be coined; and the want of a moderate\nseignorage does not in any case diminish it. Whether there is or is not a\nseignorage, if the currency contains its full standard weight, the coinage\ncosts nothing to anybody; and if it is short of that weight, the coinage\nmust always cost the difference between the quantity of bullion which\nought to be contained in it, and that which actually is contained in it.\nThe government, therefore, when it defrays the expense of coinage, not\nonly incurs some small expense, but loses some small revenue which it\nmight get by a proper duty; and neither the bank, nor any other private\npersons, are in the smallest degree benefited by this useless piece of\npublic generosity.\nThe directors of the bank, however, would probably be unwilling to agree\nto the imposition of a seignorage upon the authority of a speculation\nwhich promises them no gain, but only pretends to insure them from any\nloss. In the present state of the gold coin, and as long as it continues\nto be received by weight, they certainly would gain nothing by such a\nchange. But if the custom of weighing the gold coin should ever go into\ndisuse, as it is very likely to do, and if the gold coin should ever fall\ninto the same state of degradation in which it was before the late\nrecoinage, the gain, or more properly the savings, of the bank,\nin consequence of the imposition of a seignorage, would probably be very\nconsiderable. The bank of England is the only company which sends any\nconsiderable quantity of bullion to the mint, and the burden of the annual\ncoinage falls entirely, or almost entirely, upon it. If this annual\ncoinage had nothing to do but to repair the unavoidable losses and\nnecessary wear and tear of the coin, it could seldom exceed fifty\nthousand, or at most a hundred thousand pounds. But when the coin is\ndegraded below its standard weight, the annual coinage must, besides this,\nfill up the large vacuities which exportation and the melting pot are\ncontinually making in the current coin. It was upon this account, that\nduring the ten or twelve years immediately preceding the late reformation\nof the gold coin, the annual coinage amounted, at an average, to more than\n\u00a3850,000. But if there had been a seignorage of four or five per cent.\nupon the gold coin, it would probably, even in the state in which things\nthen were, have put an effectual stop to the business both of exportation\nand of the melting pot. The bank, instead of losing every year about two\nand a half per cent. upon the bullion which was to be coined into more\nthan eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds, or incurring an annual loss\nof more than \u00a321,250 pounds, would not probably have incurred the tenth\npart of that loss.\nThe revenue allotted by parliament for defraying the expense of the\ncoinage is but fourteen thousand pounds a-year; and the real expense which\nit costs the government, or the fees of the officers of the mint, do not,\nupon ordinary occasions, I am assured, exceed the half of that sum. The\nsaving of so very small a sum, or even the gaining of another, which could\nnot well be much larger, are objects too inconsiderable, it may be\nthought, to deserve the serious attention of government. But the saving of\neighteen or twenty thousand pounds a-year, in case of an event which is\nnot improbable, which has frequently happened before, and which is very\nlikely to happen again, is surely an object which well deserves the\nserious attention, even of so great a company as the bank of England.\nSome of the foregoing reasonings and observations might, perhaps, have\nbeen more properly placed in those chapters of the first book which treat\nof the origin and use of money, and of the difference between the real and\nthe nominal price of commodities. But as the law for the encouragement of\ncoinage derives its origin from those vulgar prejudices which have been\nintroduced by the mercantile system, I judged it more proper to reserve\nthem for this chapter. Nothing could be more agreeable to the spirit of\nthat system than a sort of bounty upon the production of money, the very\nthing which, it supposes, constitutes the wealth of every nation. It is\none of its many admirable expedients for enriching the country.\nCHAPTER VII.\nOF COLONIES.\nPART I. Of the Motives for Establishing New Colonies.\nThe interest which occasioned the first settlement of the different\nEuropean colonies in America and the West Indies, was not altogether so\nplain and distinct as that which directed the establishment of those of\nancient Greece and Rome.\nAll the different states of ancient Greece possessed, each of them, but a\nvery small territory; and when the people in anyone of them multiplied\nbeyond what that territory could easily maintain, a part of them were sent\nin quest of a new habitation, in some remote and distant part of the\nworld; the warlike neighbours who surrounded them on all sides, rendering\nit difficult for any of them to enlarge very much its territory at home.\nThe colonies of the Dorians resorted chiefly to Italy and Sicily, which,\nin the times preceding the foundation of Rome, were inhabited by barbarous\nand uncivilized nations; those of the Ionians and Aeolians, the two other\ngreat tribes of the Greeks, to Asia Minor and the islands of the Aegean\nsea, of which the inhabitants sewn at that time to have been pretty much\nin the same state as those of Sicily and Italy. The mother city, though\nshe considered the colony as a child, at all times entitled to great\nfavour and assistance, and owing in return much gratitude and respect, yet\nconsidered it as an emancipated child, over whom she pretended to claim no\ndirect authority or jurisdiction. The colony settled its own form of\ngovernment, enacted its own laws, elected its own magistrates, and made\npeace or war with its neighbours, as an independent state, which had no\noccasion to wait for the approbation or consent of the mother city.\nNothing can be more plain and distinct than the interest which directed\nevery such establishment.\nRome, like most of the other ancient republics, was originally founded\nupon an agrarian law, which divided the public territory, in a certain\nproportion, among the different citizens who composed the state. The\ncourse of human affairs, by marriage, by succession, and by alienation,\nnecessarily deranged this original division, and frequently threw the\nlands which had been allotted for the maintenance of many different\nfamilies, into the possession of a single person. To remedy this disorder,\nfor such it was supposed to be, a law was made, restricting the quantity\nof land which any citizen could possess to five hundred jugera; about 350\nEnglish acres. This law, however, though we read of its having been\nexecuted upon one or two occasions, was either neglected or evaded, and\nthe inequality of fortunes went on continually increasing. The greater\npart of the citizens had no land; and without it the manners and customs\nof those times rendered it difficult for a freeman to maintain his\nindependency. In the present times, though a poor man has no land of his\nown, if he has a little stock, he may either farm the lands of another, or\nhe may carry on some little retail trade; and if he has no stock, he may\nfind employment either as a country labourer, or as an artificer. But\namong the ancient Romans, the lands of the rich were all cultivated by\nslaves, who wrought under an overseer, who was likewise a slave; so that a\npoor freeman had little chance of being employed either as a farmer or as\na labourer. All trades and manufactures, too, even the retail trade, were\ncarried on by the slaves of the rich for the benefit of their masters,\nwhose wealth, authority, and protection, made it difficult for a poor\nfreeman to maintain the competition against them. The citizens, therefore,\nwho had no land, had scarce any other means of subsistence but the\nbounties of the candidates at the annual elections. The tribunes, when\nthey had a mind to animate the people against the rich and the great, put\nthem in mind of the ancient divisions of lands, and represented that law\nwhich restricted this sort of private property as the fundamental law of\nthe republic. The people became clamorous to get land, and the rich and\nthe great, we may believe, were perfectly determined not to give them any\npart of theirs. To satisfy them in some measure, therefore, they\nfrequently proposed to send out a new colony. But conquering Rome was,\neven upon such occasions, under no necessity of turning out her citizens\nto seek their fortune, if one may so, through the wide world, without\nknowing where they were to settle. She assigned them lands generally in\nthe conquered provinces of Italy, where, being within the dominions of the\nrepublic, they could never form any independent state, but were at best\nbut a sort of corporation, which, though it had the power of enacting\nbye-laws for its own government, was at all times subject to the\ncorrection, jurisdiction, and legislative authority of the mother city.\nThe sending out a colony of this kind not only gave some satisfaction to\nthe people, but often established a sort of garrison, too, in a newly\nconquered province, of which the obedience might otherwise have been\ndoubtful. A Roman colony, therefore, whether we consider the nature of the\nestablishment itself, or the motives for making it, was altogether\ndifferent from a Greek one. The words, accordingly, which in the original\nlanguages denote those different establishments, have very different\nmeanings. The Latin word (colonia) signifies simply a plantation. The\nGreek word (apoixia), on the contrary, signifies a separation of dwelling,\na departure from home, a going out of the house. But though the Roman\ncolonies were, in many respects, different from the Greek ones, the\ninterest which prompted to establish them was equally plain and distinct.\nBoth institutions derived their origin, either from irresistible\nnecessity, or from clear and evident utility.\nThe establishment of the European colonies in America and the West Indies\narose from no necessity; and though the utility which has resulted from\nthem has been very great, it is not altogether so clear and evident. It\nwas not understood at their first establishment, and was not the motive,\neither of that establishment, or of the discoveries which gave occasion to\nit; and the nature, extent, and limits of that utility, are not, perhaps,\nwell understood at this day.\nThe Venetians, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, carried on a\nvery advantageous commerce in spiceries and other East India goods, which\nthey distributed among the other nations of Europe. They purchased them\nchiefly in Egypt, at that time under the dominion of the Mamelukes, the\nenemies of the Turks, of whom the Venetians were the enemies; and this\nunion of interest, assisted by the money of Venice, formed such a\nconnexion as gave the Venetians almost a monopoly of the trade.\nThe great profits of the Venetians tempted the avidity of the Portuguese.\nThey had been endeavouring, during the course of the fifteenth century, to\nfind out by sea a way to the countries from which the Moors brought them\nivory and gold dust across the desert. They discovered the Madeiras, the\nCanaries, the Azores, the Cape de Verd islands, the coast of Guinea, that\nof Loango, Congo, Angola, and Benguela, and, finally, the Cape of Good\nHope. They had long wished to share in the profitable traffic of the\nVenetians, and this last discovery opened to them a probable prospect of\ndoing so. In 1497, Vasco de Gamo sailed from the port of Lisbon with a\nfleet of four ships, and, after a navigation of eleven months, arrived\nupon the coast of Indostan; and thus completed a course of discoveries\nwhich had been pursued with great steadiness, and with very little\ninterruption, for near a century together.\nSome years before this, while the expectations of Europe were in suspense\nabout the projects of the Portuguese, of which the success appeared yet to\nbe doubtful, a Genoese pilot formed the yet more daring project of sailing\nto the East Indies by the west. The situation of those countries was at\nthat time very imperfectly known in Europe. The few European travellers\nwho had been there, had magnified the distance, perhaps through simplicity\nand ignorance; what was really very great, appearing almost infinite to\nthose who could not measure it; or, perhaps, in order to increase somewhat\nmore the marvellous of their own adventures in visiting regions so\nimmensely remote from Europe. The longer the way was by the east, Columbus\nvery justly concluded, the shorter it would be by the west. He proposed,\ntherefore, to take that way, as both the shortest and the surest, and he\nhad the good fortune to convince Isabella of Castile of the probability of\nhis project. He sailed from the port of Palos in August 1492, near five\nyears before the expedition of Vasco de Gamo set out from Portugal; and,\nafter a voyage of between two and three months, discovered first some of\nthe small Bahama or Lucyan islands, and afterwards the great island of St.\nDomingo.\nBut the countries which Columbus discovered, either in this or in any of\nhis subsequent voyages, had no resemblance to those which he had gone in\nquest of. Instead of the wealth, cultivation, and populousness of China\nand Indostan, he found, in St. Domingo, and in all the other parts of the\nnew world which he ever visited, nothing but a country quite covered with\nwood, uncultivated, and inhabited only by some tribes of naked and\nmiserable savages. He was not very willing, however, to believe that they\nwere not the same with some of the countries described by Marco Polo, the\nfirst European who had visited, or at least had left behind him any\ndescription of China or the East Indies; and a very slight resemblance,\nsuch as that which he found between the name of Cibao, a mountain in St.\nDomingo, and that of Cipange, mentioned by Marco Polo, was frequently\nsufficient to make him return to this favourite prepossession, though\ncontrary to the clearest evidence. In his letters to Ferdinand and\nIsabella, he called the countries which he had discovered the Indies. He\nentertained no doubt but that they were the extremity of those which had\nbeen described by Marco Polo, and that they were not very distant from the\nGanges, or from the countries which had been conquered by Alexander. Even\nwhen at last convinced that they were different, he still flattered\nhimself that those rich countries were at no great distance; and in a\nsubsequent voyage, accordingly, went in quest of them along the coast of\nTerra Firma, and towards the Isthmus of Darien.\nIn consequence of this mistake of Columbus, the name of the Indies has\nstuck to those unfortunate countries ever since; and when it was at last\nclearly discovered that the new were altogether different from the old\nIndies, the former were called the West, in contradistinction to the\nlatter, which were called the East Indies.\nIt was of importance to Columbus, however, that the countries which he had\ndiscovered, whatever they were, should be represented to the court of\nSpain as of very great consequence; and, in what constitutes the real\nriches of every country, the animal and vegetable productions of the soil,\nthere was at that time nothing which could well justify such a\nrepresentation of them.\nThe cori, something between a rat and a rabbit, and supposed by Mr Buffon\nto be the same with the aperea of Brazil, was the largest viviparous\nquadruped in St. Domingo. This species seems never to have been very\nnumerous; and the dogs and cats of the Spaniards are said to have long ago\nalmost entirely extirpated it, as well as some other tribes of a still\nsmaller size. These, however, together with a pretty large lizard, called\nthe ivana or iguana, constituted the principal part of the animal food\nwhich the land afforded.\nThe vegetable food of the inhabitants, though, from their want of\nindustry, not very abundant, was not altogether so scanty. It consisted in\nIndian corn, yams, potatoes, bananas, etc., plants which were then\naltogether unknown in Europe, and which have never since been very much\nesteemed in it, or supposed to yield a sustenance equal to what is drawn\nfrom the common sorts of grain and pulse, which have been cultivated in\nthis part of the world time out of mind.\nThe cotton plant, indeed, afforded the material of a very important\nmanufacture, and was at that time, to Europeans, undoubtedly the most\nvaluable of all the vegetable productions of those islands. But though, in\nthe end of the fifteenth century, the muslins and other cotton goods of\nthe East Indies were much esteemed in every part of Europe, the cotton\nmanufacture itself was not cultivated in any part of it. Even this\nproduction, therefore, could not at that time appear in the eyes of\nEuropeans to be of very great consequence.\nFinding nothing, either in the animals or vegetables of the newly\ndiscovered countries which could justify a very advantageous\nrepresentation of them, Columbus turned his view towards their minerals;\nand in the richness of their productions of this third kingdom, he\nflattered himself he had found a full compensation for the insignificancy\nof those of the other two. The little bits of gold with which the\ninhabitants ornamented their dress, and which, he was informed, they\nfrequently found in the rivulets and torrents which fell from the\nmountains, were sufficient to satisfy him that those mountains abounded\nwith the richest gold mines. St. Domingo, therefore, was represented as a\ncountry abounding with gold, and upon that account (according to the\nprejudices not only of the present times, but of those times), an\ninexhaustible source of real wealth to the crown and kingdom of Spain.\nWhen Columbus, upon his return from his first voyage, was introduced with\na sort of triumphal honours to the sovereigns of Castile and Arragon, the\nprincipal productions of the countries which he had discovered were\ncarried in solemn procession before him. The only valuable part of them\nconsisted in some little fillets, bracelets, and other ornaments of gold,\nand in some bales of cotton. The rest were mere objects of vulgar wonder\nand curiosity; some reeds of an extraordinary size, some birds of a very\nbeautiful plumage, and some stuffed skins of the huge alligator and\nmanati; all of which were preceded by six or seven of the wretched\nnatives, whose singular colour and appearance added greatly to the novelty\nof the show.\nIn consequence of the representations of Columbus, the council of Castile\ndetermined to take possession of the countries of which the inhabitants\nwere plainly incapable of defending themselves. The pious purpose of\nconverting them to Christianity sanctified the injustice of the project.\nBut the hope of finding treasures of gold there was the sole motive which\nprompted to undertake it; and to give this motive the greater weight, it\nwas proposed by Columbus, that the half of all the gold and silver that\nshould be found there, should belong to the crown. This proposal was\napproved of by the council.\nAs long as the whole, or the greater part of the gold which the first\nadventurers imported into Europe was got by so very easy a method as the\nplundering of the defenceless natives, it was not perhaps very difficult\nto pay even this heavy tax; but when the natives were once fairly stript\nof all that they had, which, in St. Domingo, and in all the other\ncountries discovered by Columbus, was done completely in six or eight\nyears, and when, in order to find more, it had become necessary to dig for\nit in the mines, there was no longer any possibility of paying this tax.\nThe rigorous exaction of it, accordingly, first occasioned, it is said,\nthe total abandoning of the mines of St. Domingo, which have never been\nwrought since. It was soon reduced, therefore, to a third; then to a\nfifth; afterwards to a tenth; and at last to a twentieth part of the gross\nproduce of the gold mines. The tax upon silver continued for a long time\nto be a fifth of the gross produce. It was reduced to a tenth only in the\ncourse of the present century. But the first adventurers do not appear to\nhave been much interested about silver. Nothing less precious than gold\nseemed worthy of their attention.\nAll the other enterprizes of the Spaniards in the New World, subsequent to\nthose of Columbus, seem to have been prompted by the same motive. It was\nthe sacred thirst of gold that carried Ovieda, Nicuessa, and Vasco Nugnes\nde Balboa, to the Isthmus of Darien; that carried Cortes to Mexico,\nAlmagro and Pizarro to Chili and Peru. When those adventurers arrived upon\nany unknown coast, their first inquiry was always if there was any gold to\nbe found there; and according to the information which they received\nconcerning this particular, they determined either to quit the country or\nto settle in it.\nOf all those expensive and uncertain projects, however, which bring\nbankruptcy upon the greater part of the people who engage in them, there\nis none, perhaps, more perfectly ruinous than the search after new silver\nand gold mines. It is, perhaps, the most disadvantageous lottery in the\nworld, or the one in which the gain of those who draw the prizes bears the\nleast proportion to the loss of those who draw the blanks; for though the\nprizes are few, and the blanks many, the common price of a ticket is the\nwhole fortune of a very rich man. Projects of mining, instead of replacing\nthe capital employed in them, together with the ordinary profits of stock,\ncommonly absorb both capital and profit. They are the projects, therefore,\nto which, of all others, a prudent lawgiver, who desired to increase the\ncapital of his nation, would least choose to give any extraordinary\nencouragement, or to turn towards them a greater share of that capital\nthan what would go to them of its own accord. Such, in reality, is the\nabsurd confidence which almost all men have in their own good fortune,\nthat wherever there is the least probability of success, too great a share\nof it is apt to go to them of its own accord.\nBut though the judgment of sober reason and experience concerning such\nprojects has always been extremely unfavourable, that of human avidity has\ncommonly been quite otherwise. The same passion which has suggested to so\nmany people the absurd idea of the philosopher\u2019s stone, has suggested to\nothers the equally absurd one of immense rich mines of gold and silver.\nThey did not consider that the value of those metals has, in all ages and\nnations, arisen chiefly from their scarcity, and that their scarcity has\narisen from the very small quantities of them which nature has anywhere\ndeposited in one place, from the hard and intractable substances with\nwhich she has almost everywhere surrounded those small quantities, and\nconsequently from the labour and expense which are everywhere necessary in\norder to penetrate, and get at them. They flattered themselves that veins\nof those metals might in many places be found, as large and as abundant as\nthose which are commonly found of lead, or copper, or tin, or iron. The\ndream of Sir Waiter Raleigh, concerning the golden city and country of El\nDorado, may satisfy us, that even wise men are not always exempt from such\nstrange delusions. More than a hundred years after the death of that great\nman, the Jesuit Gumila was still convinced of the reality of that\nwonderful country, and expressed, with great warmth, and, I dare say, with\ngreat sincerity, how happy he should be to carry the light of the gospel\nto a people who could so well reward the pious labours of their\nmissionary.\nIn the countries first discovered by the Spaniards, no gold and silver\nmines are at present known which are supposed to be worth the working. The\nquantities of those metals which the first adventurers are said to have\nfound there, had probably been very much magnified, as well as the\nfertility of the mines which were wrought immediately after the first\ndiscovery. What those adventurers were reported to have found, however,\nwas sufficient to inflame the avidity of all their countrymen. Every\nSpaniard who sailed to America expected to find an El Dorado. Fortune,\ntoo, did upon this what she has done upon very few other occasions. She\nrealized in some measure the extravagant hopes of her votaries; and in the\ndiscovery and conquest of Mexico and Peru (of which the one happened about\nthirty, and the other about forty, years after the first expedition of\nColumbus), she presented them with something not very unlike that\nprofusion of the precious metals which they sought for.\nA project of commerce to the East Indies, therefore, gave occasion to the\nfirst discovery of the West. A project of conquest gave occasion to all\nthe establishments of the Spaniards in those newly discovered countries.\nThe motive which excited them to this conquest was a project of gold and\nsilver mines; and a course of accidents which no human wisdom could\nforesee, rendered this project much more successful than the undertakers\nhad any reasonable grounds for expecting.\nThe first adventurers of all the other nations of Europe who attempted to\nmake settlements in America, were animated by the like chimerical views;\nbut they were not equally successful. It was more than a hundred years\nafter the first settlement of the Brazils, before any silver, gold, or\ndiamond mines, were discovered there. In the English, French, Dutch, and\nDanish colonies, none have ever yet been discovered, at least none that\nare at present supposed to be worth the working. The first English\nsettlers in North America, however, offered a fifth of all the gold and\nsilver which should be found there to the king, as a motive for granting\nthem their patents. In the patents of Sir Waiter Raleigh, to the London\nand Plymouth companies, to the council of Plymouth, etc. this fifth was\naccordingly reserved to the crown. To the expectation of finding gold and\nsilver mines, those first settlers, too, joined that of discovering a\nnorth-west passage to the East Indies. They have hitherto been\ndisappointed in both.\nPART II. Causes of the Prosperity of New Colonies.\nThe colony of a civilized nation which takes possession either of a waste\ncountry, or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives easily give place\nto the new settlers, advances more rapidly to wealth and greatness than\nany other human society.\nThe colonies carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture and of other\nuseful arts, superior to what can grow up of its own accord, in the course\nof many centuries, among savage and barbarous nations. They carry out with\nthem, too, the habit of subordination, some notion of the regular\ngovernment which takes place in their own country, of the system of laws\nwhich support it, and of a regular administration of justice; and they\nnaturally establish something of the same kind in the new settlement. But\namong savage and barbarous nations, the natural progress of law and\ngovernment is still slower than the natural progress of arts, after law\nand government have been so far established as is necessary for their\nprotection. Every colonist gets more land than he can possibly cultivate.\nHe has no rent, and scarce any taxes, to pay. No landlord shares with him\nin its produce, and, the share of the sovereign is commonly but a trifle.\nHe has every motive to render as great as possible a produce which is thus\nto be almost entirely his own. But his land is commonly so extensive,\nthat, with all his own industry, and with all the industry of other people\nwhom he can get to employ, he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of\nwhat it is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to collect\nlabourers from all quarters, and to reward them with the most liberal\nwages. But those liberal wages, joined to the plenty and cheapness of\nland, soon make those labourers leave him, in order to become landlords\nthemselves, and to reward with equal liberality other labourers, who soon\nleave them for the same reason that they left their first master. The\nliberal reward of labour encourages marriage. The children, during the\ntender years of infancy, are well fed and properly taken care of; and when\nthey are grown up, the value of their labour greatly overpays their\nmaintenance. When arrived at maturity, the high price of labour, and the\nlow price of land, enable them to establish themselves in the same manner\nas their fathers did before them.\nIn other countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two superior\norders of people oppress the inferior one; but in new colonies, the\ninterest of the two superior orders obliges them to treat the inferior one\nwith more generosity and humanity, at least where that inferior one is not\nin a state of slavery. Waste lands, of the greatest natural fertility, are\nto be had for a trifle. The increase of revenue which the proprietor, who\nis always the undertaker, expects from their improvement, constitutes his\nprofit, which, in these circumstances, is commonly very great; but this\ngreat profit cannot be made, without employing the labour of other people\nin clearing and cultivating the land; and the disproportion between the\ngreat extent of the land and the small number of the people, which\ncommonly takes place in new colonies, makes it difficult for him to get\nthis labour. He does not, therefore, dispute about wages, but is willing\nto employ labour at any price. The high wages of labour encourage\npopulation. The cheapness and plenty of good land encourage improvement,\nand enable the proprietor to pay those high wages. In those wages consists\nalmost the whole price of the land; and though they are high, considered\nas the wages of labour, they are low, considered as the price of what is\nso very valuable. What encourages the progress of population and\nimprovement, encourages that of real wealth and greatness.\nThe progress of many of the ancient Greek colonies towards wealth and\ngreatness seems accordingly to have been very rapid. In the course of a\ncentury or two, several of them appear to have rivalled, and even to have\nsurpassed, their mother cities. Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily,\nTarentum and Locri in Italy, Ephesus and Miletus in Lesser Asia, appear,\nby all accounts, to have been at least equal to any of the cities of\nancient Greece. Though posterior in their establishment, yet all the arts\nof refinement, philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, seem to have been\ncultivated as early, and to have been improved as highly in them as in any\npart of the mother country. The schools of the two oldest Greek\nphilosophers, those of Thales and Pythagoras, were established, it is\nremarkable, not in ancient Greece, but the one in an Asiatic, the other in\nan Italian colony. All those colonies had established themselves in\ncountries inhabited by savage and barbarous nations, who easily gave place\nto the new settlers. They had plenty of good land; and as they were\naltogether independent of the mother city, they were at liberty to manage\ntheir own affairs in the way that they judged was most suitable to their\nown interest.\nThe history of the Roman colonies is by no means so brilliant. Some of\nthem, indeed, such as Florence, have, in the course of many ages, and\nafter the fall of the mother city, grown up to be considerable states. But\nthe progress of no one of them seems ever to have been very rapid. They\nwere all established in conquered provinces, which in most cases had been\nfully inhabited before. The quantity of land assigned to each colonist was\nseldom very considerable, and, as the colony was not independent, they\nwere not always at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way that\nthey judged was most suitable to their own interest.\nIn the plenty of good land, the European colonies established in America\nand the West Indies resemble, and even greatly surpass, those of ancient\nGreece. In their dependency upon the mother state, they resemble those of\nancient Rome; but their great distance from Europe has in all of them\nalleviated more or less the effects of this dependency. Their situation\nhas placed them less in the view, and less in the power of their mother\ncountry. In pursuing their interest their own way, their conduct has upon\nmany occasions been overlooked, either because not known or not understood\nin Europe; and upon some occasions it has been fairly suffered and\nsubmitted to, because their distance rendered it difficult to restrain it.\nEven the violent and arbitrary government of Spain has, upon many\noccasions, been obliged to recall or soften the orders which had been\ngiven for the government of her colonies, for fear of a general\ninsurrection. The progress of all the European colonies in wealth,\npopulation, and improvement, has accordingly been very great.\nThe crown of Spain, by its share of the gold and silver, derived some\nrevenue from its colonies from the moment of their first establishment. It\nwas a revenue, too, of a nature to excite in human avidity the most\nextravagant expectation of still greater riches. The Spanish colonies,\ntherefore, from the moment of their first establishment, attracted very\nmuch the attention of their mother country; while those of the other\nEuropean nations were for a long time in a great measure neglected. The\nformer did not, perhaps, thrive the better in consequence of this\nattention, nor the latter the worse in consequence of this neglect. In\nproportion to the extent of the country which they in some measure\npossess, the Spanish colonies are considered as less populous and thriving\nthan those of almost any other European nation. The progress even of the\nSpanish colonies, however, in population and improvement, has certainly\nbeen very rapid and very great. The city of Lima, founded since the\nconquest, is represented by Ulloa as containing fifty thousand inhabitants\nnear thirty years ago. Quito, which had been but a miserable hamlet of\nIndians, is represented by the same author as in his time equally\npopulous. Gemel i Carreri, a pretended traveller, it is said, indeed, but\nwho seems everywhere to have written upon extreme good information,\nrepresents the city of Mexico as containing a hundred thousand\ninhabitants; a number which, in spite of all the exaggerations of the\nSpanish writers, is probably more than five times greater than what it\ncontained in the time of Montezuma. These numbers exceed greatly those of\nBoston, New York, and Philadelphia, the three greatest cities of the\nEnglish colonies. Before the conquest of the Spaniards, there were no\ncattle fit for draught, either in Mexico or Peru. The lama was their only\nbeast of burden, and its strength seems to have been a good deal inferior\nto that of a common ass. The plough was unknown among them. They were\nignorant of the use of iron. They had no coined money, nor any established\ninstrument of commerce of any kind. Their commerce was carried on by\nbarter. A sort of wooden spade was their principal instrument of\nagriculture. Sharp stones served them for knives and hatchets to cut with;\nfish bones, and the hard sinews of certain animals, served them with\nneedles to sew with; and these seem to have been their principal\ninstruments of trade. In this state of things, it seems impossible that\neither of those empires could have been so much improved or so well\ncultivated as at present, when they are plentifully furnished with all\nsorts of European cattle, and when the use of iron, of the plough, and of\nmany of the arts of Europe, have been introduced among them. But the\npopulousness of every country must be in proportion to the degree of its\nimprovement and cultivation. In spite of the cruel destruction of the\nnatives which followed the conquest, these two great empires are probably\nmore populous now than they ever were before; and the people are surely\nvery different; for we must acknowledge, I apprehend, that the Spanish\ncreoles are in many respects superior to the ancient Indians.\nAfter the settlements of the Spaniards, that of the Portuguese in Brazil\nis the oldest of any European nation in America. But as for a long time\nafter the first discovery neither gold nor silver mines were found in it,\nand as it afforded upon that account little or no revenue to the crown, it\nwas for a long time in a great measure neglected; and during this state of\nneglect, it grew up to be a great and powerful colony. While Portugal was\nunder the dominion of Spain, Brazil was attacked by the Dutch, who got\npossession of seven of the fourteen provinces into which it is divided.\nThey expected soon to conquer the other seven, when Portugal recovered its\nindependency by the elevation of the family of Braganza to the throne. The\nDutch, then, as enemies to the Spaniards, became friends to the\nPortuguese, who were likewise the enemies of the Spaniards. They agreed,\ntherefore, to leave that part of Brazil which they had not conquered to\nthe king of Portugal, who agreed to leave that part which they had\nconquered to them, as a matter not worth disputing about, with such good\nallies. But the Dutch government soon began to oppress the Portuguese\ncolonists, who, instead of amusing themselves with complaints, took arms\nagainst their new masters, and by their own valour and resolution, with\nthe connivance, indeed, but without any avowed assistance from the mother\ncountry, drove them out of Brazil. The Dutch, therefore, finding it\nimpossible to keep any part of the country to themselves, were contented\nthat it should be entirely restored to the crown of Portugal. In this\ncolony there are said to be more than six hundred thousand people, either\nPortuguese or descended from Portuguese, creoles, mulattoes, and a mixed\nrace between Portuguese and Brazilians. No one colony in America is\nsupposed to contain so great a number of people of European extraction.\nTowards the end of the fifteenth, and during the greater part of the\nsixteenth century, Spain and Portugal were the two great naval powers upon\nthe ocean; for though the commerce of Venice extended to every part of\nEurope, its fleet had scarce ever sailed beyond the Mediterranean. The\nSpaniards, in virtue of the first discovery, claimed all America as their\nown; and though they could not hinder so great a naval power as that of\nPortugal from settling in Brazil, such was at that time the terror of\ntheir name, that the greater part of the other nations of Europe were\nafraid to establish themselves in any other part of that great continent.\nThe French, who attempted to settle in Florida, were all murdered by the\nSpaniards. But the declension of the naval power of this latter nation, in\nconsequence of the defeat or miscarriage of what they called their\ninvincible armada, which happened towards the end of the sixteenth\ncentury, put it out of their power to obstruct any longer the settlements\nof the other European nations. In the course of the seventeenth century,\ntherefore, the English, French, Dutch, Danes, and Swedes, all the great\nnations who had any ports upon the ocean, attempted to make some\nsettlements in the new world.\nThe Swedes established themselves in New Jersey; and the number of Swedish\nfamilies still to be found there sufficiently demonstrates, that this\ncolony was very likely to prosper, had it been protected by the mother\ncountry. But being neglected by Sweden, it was soon swallowed up by the\nDutch colony of New York, which again, in 1674, fell under the dominion of\nthe English.\nThe small islands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz, are the only countries in\nthe new world that have ever been possessed by the Danes. These little\nsettlements, too, were under the government of an exclusive company, which\nhad the sole right, both of purchasing the surplus produce of the\ncolonies, and of supplying them with such goods of other countries as they\nwanted, and which, therefore, both in its purchases and sales, had not\nonly the power of oppressing them, but the greatest temptation to do so.\nThe government of an exclusive company of merchants is, perhaps, the worst\nof all governments for any country whatever. It was not, however, able to\nstop altogether the progress of these colonies, though it rendered it more\nslow and languid. The late king of Denmark dissolved this company, and\nsince that time the prosperity of these colonies has been very great.\nThe Dutch settlements in the West, as well as those in the East Indies,\nwere originally put under the government of an exclusive company. The\nprogress of some of them, therefore, though it has been considerable in\ncomparison with that of almost any country that has been long peopled and\nestablished, has been languid and slow in comparison with that of the\ngreater part of new colonies. The colony of Surinam, though very\nconsiderable, is still inferior to the greater part of the sugar colonies\nof the other European nations. The colony of Nova Belgia, now divided into\nthe two provinces of New York and New Jersey, would probably have soon\nbecome considerable too, even though it had remained under the government\nof the Dutch. The plenty and cheapness of good land are such powerful\ncauses of prosperity, that the very worst government is scarce capable of\nchecking altogether the efficacy of their operation. The great distance,\ntoo, from the mother country, would enable the colonists to evade more or\nless, by smuggling, the monopoly which the company enjoyed against them.\nAt present, the company allows all Dutch ships to trade to Surinam, upon\npaying two and a-half per cent. upon the value of their cargo for a\nlicense; and only reserves to itself exclusively, the direct trade from\nAfrica to America, which consists almost entirely in the slave trade. This\nrelaxation in the exclusive privileges of the company, is probably the\nprincipal cause of that degree of prosperity which that colony at present\nenjoys. Curacoa and Eustatia, the two principal islands belonging to the\nDutch, are free ports, open to the ships of all nations; and this freedom,\nin the midst of better colonies, whose ports are open to those of one\nnation only, has been the great cause of the prosperity of those two\nbarren islands.\nThe French colony of Canada was, during the greater part of the last\ncentury, and some part of the present, under the government of an\nexclusive company. Under so unfavourable an administration, its progress\nwas necessarily very slow, in comparison with that of other new colonies;\nbut it became much more rapid when this company was dissolved, after the\nfall of what is called the Mississippi scheme. When the English got\npossession of this country, they found in it near double the number of\ninhabitants which father Charlevoix had assigned to it between twenty and\nthirty years before. That jesuit had travelled over the whole country, and\nhad no inclination to represent it as less inconsiderable than it really\nwas.\nThe French colony of St. Domingo was established by pirates and\nfreebooters, who, for a long time, neither required the protection, nor\nacknowledged the authority of France; and when that race of banditti\nbecame so far citizens as to acknowledge this authority, it was for a long\ntime necessary to exercise it with very great gentleness. During this\nperiod, the population and improvement of this colony increased very fast.\nEven the oppression of the exclusive company, to which it was for some\ntime subjected with all the other colonies of France, though it no doubt\nretarded, had not been able to stop its progress altogether. The course of\nits prosperity returned as soon as it was relieved from that oppression.\nIt is now the most important of the sugar colonies of the West Indies, and\nits produce is said to be greater than that of all the English sugar\ncolonies put together. The other sugar colonies of France are in general\nall very thriving.\nBut there are no colonies of which the progress has been more rapid than\nthat of the English in North America.\nPlenty of good land, and liberty to manage their own affairs their own\nway, seem to be the two great causes of the prosperity of all new\ncolonies.\nIn the plenty of good land, the English colonies of North America, though\nno doubt very abundantly provided, are, however, inferior to those of the\nSpaniards and Portuguese, and not superior to some of those possessed by\nthe French before the late war. But the political institutions of the\nEnglish colonies have been more favourable to the improvement and\ncultivation of this land, than those of the other three nations.\nFirst, The engrossing of uncultivated land, though it has by no means been\nprevented altogether, has been more restrained in the English colonies\nthan in any other. The colony law, which imposes upon every proprietor the\nobligation of improving and cultivating, within a limited time, a certain\nproportion of his lands, and which, in case of failure, declares those\nneglected lands grantable to any other person; though it has not perhaps\nbeen very strictly executed, has, however, had some effect.\nSecondly, In Pennsylvania there is no right of primogeniture, and lands,\nlike moveables, are divided equally among all the children of the family.\nIn three of the provinces of New England, the oldest has only a double\nshare, as in the Mosaical law. Though in those provinces, therefore, too\ngreat a quantity of land should sometimes be engrossed by a particular\nindividual, it is likely, in the course of a generation or two, to be\nsufficiently divided again. In the other English colonies, indeed, the\nright of primogeniture takes place, as in the law of England: But in all\nthe English colonies, the tenure of the lands, which are all held by free\nsoccage, facilitates alienation; and the grantee of an extensive tract of\nland generally finds it for his interest to alienate, as fast as he can,\nthe greater part of it, reserving only a small quit-rent. In the Spanish\nand Portuguese colonies, what is called the right of majorazzo takes place\nin the succession of all those great estates to which any title of honour\nis annexed. Such estates go all to one person, and are in effect entailed\nand unalienable. The French colonies, indeed, are subject to the custom of\nParis, which, in the inheritance of land, is much more favourable to the\nyounger children than the law of England. But, in the French colonies, if\nany part of an estate, held by the noble tenure of chivalry and homage, is\nalienated, it is, for a limited time, subject to the right of redemption,\neither by the heir of the superior, or by the heir of the family; and all\nthe largest estates of the country are held by such noble tenures, which\nnecessarily embarrass alienation. But, in a new colony, a great\nuncultivated estate is likely to be much more speedily divided by\nalienation than by succession. The plenty and cheapness of good land, it\nhas already been observed, are the principal causes of the rapid\nprosperity of new colonies. The engrossing of land, in effect, destroys\nthis plenty and cheapness. The engrossing of uncultivated land, besides,\nis the greatest obstruction to its improvement; but the labour that is\nemployed in the improvement and cultivation of land affords the greatest\nand most valuable produce to the society. The produce of labour, in this\ncase, pays not only its own wages and the profit of the stock which\nemploys it, but the rent of the land too upon which it is employed. The\nlabour of the English colonies, therefore, being more employed in the\nimprovement and cultivation of land, is likely to afford a greater and\nmore valuable produce than that of any of the other three nations, which,\nby the engrossing of land, is more or less diverted towards other\nemployments.\nThirdly, The labour of the English colonists is not only likely to afford\na greater and more valuable produce, but, in consequence of the moderation\nof their taxes, a greater proportion of this produce belongs to\nthemselves, which they may store up and employ in putting into motion a\nstill greater quantity of labour. The English colonists have never yet\ncontributed any thing towards the defence of the mother country, or\ntowards the support of its civil government. They themselves, on the\ncontrary, have hitherto been defended almost entirely at the expense of\nthe mother country; but the expense of fleets and armies is out of all\nproportion greater than the necessary expense of civil government. The\nexpense of their own civil government has always been very moderate. It\nhas generally been confined to what was necessary for paying competent\nsalaries to the governor, to the judges, and to some other officers of\npolice, and for maintaining a few of the most useful public works. The\nexpense of the civil establishment of Massachusetts Bay, before the\ncommencement of the present disturbances, used to be but about \u00a318;000\na-year; that of New Hampshire and Rhode Island, \u00a33500 each; that of\nConnecticut, \u00a34000; that of New York and Pennsylvania, \u00a34500 each; that of\nNew Jersey, \u00a31200; that of Virginia and South Carolina, \u00a38000 each. The\ncivil establishments of Nova Scotia and Georgia are partly supported by an\nannual grant of parliament; but Nova Scotia pays, besides, about \u00a37000\na-year towards the public expenses of the colony, and Georgia about \u00a32500\na-year. All the different civil establishments in North America, in short,\nexclusive of those of Maryland and North Carolina, of which no exact\naccount has been got, did not, before the commencement of the present\ndisturbances, cost the inhabitants above \u00a364,700 a-year; an ever memorable\nexample, at how small an expense three millions of people may not only be\ngoverned but well governed. The most important part of the expense of\ngovernment, indeed, that of defence and protection, has constantly fallen\nupon the mother country. The ceremonial, too, of the civil government in\nthe colonies, upon the reception of a new governor, upon the opening of a\nnew assembly, etc. though sufficiently decent, is not accompanied with any\nexpensive pomp or parade. Their ecclesiastical government is conducted\nupon a plan equally frugal. Tithes are unknown among them; and their\nclergy, who are far from being numerous, are maintained either by moderate\nstipends, or by the voluntary contributions of the people. The power of\nSpain and Portugal, on the contrary, derives some support from the taxes\nlevied upon their colonies. France, indeed, has never drawn any\nconsiderable revenue from its colonies, the taxes which it levies upon\nthem being generally spent among them. But the colony government of all\nthese three nations is conducted upon a much more extensive plan, and is\naccompanied with a much more expensive ceremonial. The sums spent upon the\nreception of a new viceroy of Peru, for example, have frequently been\nenormous. Such ceremonials are not only real taxes paid by the rich\ncolonists upon those particular occasions, but they serve to introduce\namong them the habit of vanity and expense upon all other occasions. They\nare not only very grievous occasional taxes, but they contribute to\nestablish perpetual taxes, of the same kind, still more grievous; the\nruinous taxes of private luxury and extravagance. In the colonies of all\nthose three nations, too, the ecclesiastical government is extremely\noppressive. Tithes take place in all of them, and are levied with the\nutmost rigour in those of Spain and Portugal. All of them, besides, are\noppressed with a numerous race of mendicant friars, whose beggary being\nnot only licensed but consecrated by religion, is a most grievous tax upon\nthe poor people, who are most carefully taught that it is a duty to give,\nand a very great sin to refuse them their charity. Over and above all\nthis, the clergy are, in all of them, the greatest engrossers of land.\nFourthly, In the disposal of their surplus produce, or of what is over and\nabove their own consumption, the English colonies have been more favoured,\nand have been allowed a more extensive market, than those of any other\nEuropean nation. Every European nation has endeavoured, more or less, to\nmonopolize to itself the commerce of its colonies, and, upon that account,\nhas prohibited the ships of foreign nations from trading to them, and has\nprohibited them from importing European goods from any foreign nation. But\nthe manner in which this monopoly has been exercised in different nations,\nhas been very different.\nSome nations have given up the whole commerce of their colonies to an\nexclusive company, of whom the colonists were obliged to buy all such\nEuropean goods as they wanted, and to whom they were obliged to sell the\nwhole of their surplus produce. It was the interest of the company,\ntherefore, not only to sell the former as dear, and to buy the latter as\ncheap as possible, but to buy no more of the latter, even at this low\nprice, than what they could dispose of for a very high price in Europe. It\nwas their interest not only to degrade in all cases the value of the\nsurplus produce of the colony, but in many cases to discourage and keep\ndown the natural increase of its quantity. Of all the expedients that can\nwell be contrived to stunt the natural growth of a new colony, that of an\nexclusive company is undoubtedly the most effectual. This, however, has\nbeen the policy of Holland, though their company, in the course of the\npresent century, has given up in many respects the exertion of their\nexclusive privilege. This, too, was the policy of Denmark, till the reign\nof the late king. It has occasionally been the policy of France; and of\nlate, since 1755, after it had been abandoned by all other nations on\naccount of its absurdity, it has become the policy of Portugal, with\nregard at least to two of the principal provinces of Brazil, Pernambucco,\nand Marannon.\nOther nations, without establishing an exclusive company, have confined\nthe whole commerce of their colonies to a particular port of the mother\ncountry, from whence no ship was allowed to sail, but either in a fleet\nand at a particular season, or, if single, in consequence of a particular\nlicense, which in most cases was very well paid for. This policy opened,\nindeed, the trade of the colonies to all the natives of the mother\ncountry, provided they traded from the proper port, at the proper season,\nand in the proper vessels. But as all the different merchants, who joined\ntheir stocks in order to fit out those licensed vessels, would find it for\ntheir interest to act in concert, the trade which was carried on in this\nmanner would necessarily be conducted very nearly upon the same principles\nas that of an exclusive company. The profit of those merchants would be\nalmost equally exorbitant and oppressive. The colonies would be ill\nsupplied, and would be obliged both to buy very dear, and to sell very\ncheap. This, however, till within these few years, had always been the\npolicy of Spain; and the price of all European goods, accordingly, is said\nto have been enormous in the Spanish West Indies. At Quito, we are told by\nUlloa, a pound of iron sold for about 4s:6d., and a pound of steel for\nabout 6s:9d. sterling. But it is chiefly in order to purchase European\ngoods that the colonies part with their own produce. The more, therefore,\nthey pay for the one, the less they really get for the other, and the\ndearness of the one is the same thing with the cheapness of the other. The\npolicy of Portugal is, in this respect, the same as the ancient policy of\nSpain, with regard to all its colonies, except Pernambucco and Marannon;\nand with regard to these it has lately adopted a still worse.\nOther nations leave the trade of their colonies free to all their\nsubjects, who may carry it on from all the different ports of the mother\ncountry, and who have occasion for no other license than the common\ndespatches of the custom-house. In this case the number and dispersed\nsituation of the different traders renders it impossible for them to enter\ninto any general combination, and their competition is sufficient to\nhinder them from making very exorbitant profits. Under so liberal a\npolicy, the colonies are enabled both to sell their own produce, and to\nbuy the goods of Europe at a reasonable price; but since the dissolution\nof the Plymouth company, when our colonies were but in their infancy, this\nhas always been the policy of England. It has generally, too, been that of\nFrance, and has been uniformly so since the dissolution of what in England\nis commonly called their Mississippi company. The profits of the trade,\ntherefore, which France and England carry on with their colonies, though\nno doubt somewhat higher than if the competition were free to all other\nnations, are, however, by no means exorbitant; and the price of European\ngoods, accordingly, is not extravagantly high in the greater past of the\ncolonies of either of those nations.\nIn the exportation of their own surplus produce, too, it is only with\nregard to certain commodities that the colonies of Great Britain are\nconfined to the market of the mother country. These commodities having\nbeen enumerated in the act of navigation, and in some other subsequent\nacts, have upon that account been called enumerated commodities. The rest\nare called non-enumerated, and may be exported directly to other\ncountries, provided it is in British or plantation ships, of which the\nowners and three fourths of the mariners are British subjects.\nAmong the non-enumerated commodities are some of the most important\nproductions of America and the West Indies, grain of all sorts, lumber,\nsalt provisions, fish, sugar, and rum.\nGrain is naturally the first and principal object of the culture of all\nnew colonies. By allowing them a very extensive market for it, the law\nencourages them to extend this culture much beyond the consumption of a\nthinly inhabited country, and thus to provide beforehand an ample\nsubsistence for a continually increasing population.\nIn a country quite covered with wood, where timber consequently is of\nlittle or no value, the expense of clearing the ground is the principal\nobstacle to improvement. By allowing the colonies a very extensive market\nfor their lumber, the law endeavours to facilitate improvement by raising\nthe price of a commodity which would otherwise be of little value, and\nthereby enabling them to make some profit of what would otherwise be mere\nexpense.\nIn a country neither half peopled nor half cultivated, cattle naturally\nmultiply beyond the consumption of the inhabitants, and are often, upon\nthat account, of little or no value. But it is necessary, it has already\nbeen shown, that the price of cattle should bear a certain proportion to\nthat of corn, before the greater part of the lands of any country can be\nimproved. By allowing to American cattle, in all shapes, dead and alive, a\nvery extensive market, the law endeavours to raise the value of a\ncommodity, of which the high price is so very essential to improvement.\nThe good effects of this liberty, however, must be somewhat diminished by\nthe 4th of Geo. III. c. 15, which puts hides and skins among the\nenumerated commodities, and thereby tends to reduce the value of American\ncattle.\nTo increase the shipping and naval power of Great Britain by the extension\nof the fisheries of our colonies, is an object which the legislature seems\nto have had almost constantly in view. Those fisheries, upon this account,\nhave had all the encouragement which freedom can give them, and they have\nflourished accordingly. The New England fishery, in particular, was,\nbefore the late disturbances, one of the most important, perhaps, in the\nworld. The whale fishery which, notwithstanding an extravagant bounty, is\nin Great Britain carried on to so little purpose, that in the opinion of\nmany people ( which I do not, however, pretend to warrant), the whole\nproduce does not much exceed the value of the bounties which are annually\npaid for it, is in New England carried on, without any bounty, to a very\ngreat extent. Fish is one of the principal articles with which the North\nAmericans trade to Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean.\nSugar was originally an enumerated commodity, which could only be exported\nto Great Britain; but in 1751, upon a representation of the\nsugar-planters, its exportation was permitted to all parts of the world.\nThe restrictions, however, with which this liberty was granted, joined to\nthe high price of sugar in Great Britain, have rendered it in a great\nmeasure ineffectual. Great Britain and her colonies still continue to be\nalmost the sole market for all sugar produced in the British plantations.\nTheir consumption increases so fast, that, though in consequence of the\nincreasing improvement of Jamaica, as well as of the ceded islands, the\nimportation of sugar has increased very greatly within these twenty years,\nthe exportation to foreign countries is said to be not much greater than\nbefore.\nRum is a very important article in the trade which the Americans carry on\nto the coast of Africa, from which they bring back negro slaves in return.\nIf the whole surplus produce of America, in grain of all sorts, in salt\nprovisions, and in fish, had been put into the enumeration, and thereby\nforced into the market of Great Britain, it would have interfered too much\nwith the produce of the industry of our own people. It was probably not so\nmuch from any regard to the interest of America, as from a jealousy of\nthis interference, that those important commodities have not only been\nkept out of the enumeration, but that the importation into Great Britain\nof all grain, except rice, and of all salt provisions, has, in the\nordinary state of the law, been prohibited.\nThe non-enumerated commodities could originally be exported to all parts\nof the world. Lumber and rice having been once put into the enumeration,\nwhen they were afterwards taken out of it, were confined, as to the\nEuropean market, to the countries that lie south of Cape Finisterre. By\nthe 6th of George III. c. 52, all non-enumerated commodities were\nsubjected to the like restriction. The parts of Europe which lie south of\nCape Finisterre are not manufacturing countries, and we are less jealous\nof the colony ships carrying home from them any manufactures which could\ninterfere with our own.\nThe enumerated commodities are of two sorts; first, such as are either the\npeculiar produce of America, or as cannot be produced, or at least are not\nproduced in the mother country. Of this kind are molasses, coffee,\ncocoa-nuts, tobacco, pimento, ginger, whalefins, raw silk, cotton, wool,\nbeaver, and other peltry of America, indigo, fustick, and other dyeing\nwoods; secondly, such as are not the peculiar produce of America, but\nwhich are, and may be produced in the mother country, though not in such\nquantities as to supply the greater part of her demand, which is\nprincipally supplied from foreign countries. Of this kind are all naval\nstores, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and turpentine, pig and\nbar iron, copper ore, hides and skins, pot and pearl ashes. The largest\nimportation of commodities of the first kind could not discourage the\ngrowth, or interfere with the sale, of any part of the produce of the\nmother country. By confining them to the home market, our merchants, it\nwas expected, would not only be enabled to buy them cheaper in the\nplantations, and consequently to sell them with a better profit at home,\nbut to establish between the plantations and foreign countries an\nadvantageous carrying trade, of which Great Britain was necessarily to be\nthe centre or emporium, as the European country into which those\ncommodities were first to be imported. The importation of commodities of\nthe second kind might be so managed too, it was supposed, as to interfere,\nnot with the sale of those of the same kind which were produced at home,\nbut with that of those which were imported from foreign countries;\nbecause, by means of proper duties, they might be rendered always somewhat\ndearer than the former, and yet a good deal cheaper than the latter. By\nconfining such commodities to the home market, therefore, it was proposed\nto discourage the produce, not of Great Britain, but of some foreign\ncountries with which the balance of trade was believed to be unfavourable\nto Great Britain.\nThe prohibition of exporting from the colonies to any other country but\nGreat Britain, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and turpentine,\nnaturally tended to lower the price of timber in the colonies, and\nconsequently to increase the expense of clearing their lands, the\nprincipal obstacle to their improvement. But about the beginning of the\npresent century, in 1703, the pitch and tar company of Sweden endeavoured\nto raise the price of their commodities to Great Britain, by prohibiting\ntheir exportation, except in their own ships, at their own price, and in\nsuch quantities as they thought proper. In order to counteract this\nnotable piece of mercantile policy, and to render herself as much as\npossible independent, not only of Sweden, but of all the other northern\npowers, Great Britain gave a bounty upon the importation of naval stores\nfrom America; and the effect of this bounty was to raise the price of\ntimber in America much more than the confinement to the home market could\nlower it; and as both regulations were enacted at the same time, their\njoint effect was rather to encourage than to discourage the clearing of\nland in America.\nThough pig and bar iron, too, have been put among the enumerated\ncommodities, yet as, when imported from America, they are exempted from\nconsiderable duties to which they are subject when imported front any\nother country, the one part of the regulation contributes more to\nencourage the erection of furnaces in America than the other to discourage\nit. There is no manufacture which occasions so great a consumption of wood\nas a furnace, or which can contribute so much to the clearing of a country\novergrown with it.\nThe tendency of some of these regulations to raise the value of timber in\nAmerica, and thereby to facilitate the clearing of the land, was neither,\nperhaps, intended nor understood by the legislature. Though their\nbeneficial effects, however, have been in this respect accidental, they\nhave not upon that account been less real.\nThe most perfect freedom of trade is permitted between the British\ncolonies of America and the West Indies, both in the enumerated and in the\nnon-enumerated commodities Those colonies are now become so populous and\nthriving, that each of them finds in some of the others a great and\nextensive market for every part of its produce. All of them taken\ntogether, they make a great internal market for the produce of one\nanother.\nThe liberality of England, however, towards the trade of her colonies, has\nbeen confined chiefly to what concerns the market for their produce,\neither in its rude state, or in what may be called the very first stage of\nmanufacture. The more advanced or more refined manufactures, even of the\ncolony produce, the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain chuse to\nreserve to themselves, and have prevailed upon the legislature to prevent\ntheir establishment in the colonies, sometimes by high duties, and\nsometimes by absolute prohibitions.\nWhile, for example, Muscovado sugars from the British plantations pay,\nupon importation, only 6s:4d. the hundred weight, white sugars pay \u00a31:1:1;\nand refined, either double or single, in loaves, \u00a34:2:5 \u2078\u2044\u2082\u2080ths. When\nthose high duties were imposed, Great Britain was the sole, and she still\ncontinues to be, the principal market, to which the sugars of the British\ncolonies could be exported. They amounted, therefore, to a prohibition, at\nfirst of claying or refining sugar for any foreign market, and at present\nof claying or refining it for the market which takes off, perhaps, more\nthan nine-tenths of the whole produce. The manufacture of claying or\nrefining sugar, accordingly, though it has flourished in all the sugar\ncolonies of France, has been little cultivated in any of those of England,\nexcept for the market of the colonies themselves. While Grenada was in the\nhands of the French, there was a refinery of sugar, by claying, at least\nupon almost every plantation. Since it fell into those of the English,\nalmost all works of this kind have been given up; and there are at present\n(October 1773), I am assured, not above two or three remaining in the\nisland. At present, however, by an indulgence of the custom-house, clayed\nor refined sugar, if reduced from loaves into powder, is commonly imported\nas Muscovado.\nWhile Great Britain encourages in America the manufacturing of pig and bar\niron, by exempting them from duties to which the like commodities are\nsubject when imported from any other country, she imposes an absolute\nprohibition upon the erection of steel furnaces and slit-mills in any of\nher American plantations. She will not suffer her colonies to work in\nthose more refined manufactures, even for their own consumption; but\ninsists upon their purchasing of her merchants and manufacturers all goods\nof this kind which they have occasion for.\nShe prohibits the exportation from one province to another by water, and\neven the carriage by land upon horseback, or in a cart, of hats, of wools,\nand woollen goods, of the produce of America; a regulation which\neffectually prevents the establishment of any manufacture of such\ncommodities for distant sale, and confines the industry of her colonists\nin this way to such coarse and household manufactures as a private family\ncommonly makes for its own use, or for that of some of its neighbours in\nthe same province.\nTo prohibit a great people, however, from making all that they can of\nevery part of their own produce, or from employing their stock and\nindustry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves, is a\nmanifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind. Unjust, however,\nas such prohibitions may be, they have not hitherto been very hurtful to\nthe colonies. Land is still so cheap, and, consequently, labour so dear\namong them, that they can import from the mother country almost all the\nmore refined or more advanced manufactures cheaper than they could make\nthem for themselves. Though they had not, therefore, been prohibited from\nestablishing such manufactures, yet, in their present state of\nimprovement, a regard to their own interest would probably have prevented\nthem from doing so. In their present state of improvement, those\nprohibitions, perhaps, without cramping their industry, or restraining it\nfrom any employment to which it would have gone of its own accord, are\nonly impertinent badges of slavery imposed upon them, without any\nsufficient reason, by the groundless jealousy of the merchants and\nmanufacturers of the mother country. In a more advanced state, they might\nbe really oppressive and insupportable.\nGreat Britain, too, as she confines to her own market some of the most\nimportant productions of the colonies, so, in compensation, she gives to\nsome of them an advantage in that market, sometimes by imposing higher\nduties upon the like productions when imported from other countries, and\nsometimes by giving bounties upon their importation from the colonies. In\nthe first way, she gives an advantage in the home market to the sugar,\ntobacco, and iron of her own colonies; and, in the second, to their raw\nsilk, to their hemp and flax, to their indigo, to their naval stores, and\nto their building timber. This second way of encouraging the colony\nproduce, by bounties upon importation, is, so far as I have been able to\nlearn, peculiar to Great Britain: the first is not. Portugal does not\ncontent herself with imposing higher duties upon the importation of\ntobacco from any other country, but prohibits it under the severest\npenalties.\nWith regard to the importation of goods from Europe, England has likewise\ndealt more liberally with her colonies than any other nation.\nGreat Britain allows a part, almost always the half, generally a larger\nportion, and sometimes the whole, of the duty which is paid upon the\nimportation of foreign goods, to be drawn back upon their exportation to\nany foreign country. No independent foreign country, it was easy to\nforesee, would receive them, if they came to it loaded with the heavy\nduties to which almost all foreign goods are subjected on their\nimportation into Great Britain. Unless, therefore, some part of those\nduties was drawn back upon exportation, there was an end of the carrying\ntrade; a trade so much favoured by the mercantile system.\nOur colonies, however, are by no means independent foreign countries; and\nGreat Britain having assumed to herself the exclusive right of supplying\nthem with all goods from Europe, might have forced them (in the same\nmanner as other countries have done their colonies) to receive such goods\nloaded with all the same duties which they paid in the mother country.\nBut, on the contrary, till 1763, the same drawbacks were paid upon the\nexportation of the greater part of foreign goods to our colonies, as to\nany independent foreign country. In 1763, indeed, by the 4th of Geo. III.\nc. 15, this indulgence was a good deal abated, and it was enacted, \u201cThat\nno part of the duty called the old subsidy should be drawn back for any\ngoods of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe or the East\nIndies, which should be exported from this kingdom to any British colony\nor plantation in America; wines, white calicoes, and muslins, excepted.\u201d\nBefore this law, many different sorts of foreign goods might have been\nbought cheaper in the plantations than in the mother country, and some may\nstill.\nOf the greater part of the regulations concerning the colony trade, the\nmerchants who carry it on, it must be observed, have been the principal\nadvisers. We must not wonder, therefore, if, in a great part of them,\ntheir interest has been more considered than either that of the colonies\nor that of the mother country. In their exclusive privilege of supplying\nthe colonies with all the goods which they wanted from Europe, and of\npurchasing all such parts of their surplus produce as could not interfere\nwith any of the trades which they themselves carried on at home, the\ninterest of the colonies was sacrificed to the interest of those\nmerchants. In allowing the same drawbacks upon the re-exportation of the\ngreater part of European and East India goods to the colonies, as upon\ntheir re-exportation to any independent country, the interest of the\nmother country was sacrificed to it, even according to the mercantile\nideas of that interest. It was for the interest of the merchants to pay as\nlittle as possible for the foreign goods which they sent to the colonies,\nand, consequently, to get back as much as possible of the duties which\nthey advanced upon their importation into Great Britain. They might\nthereby be enabled to sell in the colonies, either the same quantity of\ngoods with a greater profit, or a greater quantity with the same profit,\nand, consequently, to gain something either in the one way or the other.\nIt was likewise for the interest of the colonies to get all such goods as\ncheap, and in as great abundance as possible. But this might not always be\nfor the interest of the mother country. She might frequently suffer, both\nin her revenue, by giving back a great part of the duties which had been\npaid upon the importation of such goods; and in her manufactures, by being\nundersold in the colony market, in consequence of the easy terms upon\nwhich foreign manufactures could be carried thither by means of those\ndrawbacks. The progress of the linen manufacture of Great Britain, it is\ncommonly said, has been a good deal retarded by the drawbacks upon the\nre-exportation of German linen to the American colonies.\nBut though the policy of Great Britain, with regard to the trade of her\ncolonies, has been dictated by the same mercantile spirit as that of other\nnations, it has, however, upon the whole, been less illiberal and\noppressive than that of any of them.\nIn every thing except their foreign trade, the liberty of the English\ncolonists to manage their own affairs their own way, is complete. It is in\nevery respect equal to that of their fellow-citizens at home, and is\nsecured in the same manner, by an assembly of the representatives of the\npeople, who claim the sole right of imposing taxes for the support of the\ncolony government. The authority of this assembly overawes the executive\npower; and neither the meanest nor the most obnoxious colonist, as long as\nhe obeys the law, has any thing to fear from the resentment, either of the\ngovernor, or of any other civil or military officer in the province. The\ncolony assemblies, though, like the house of commons in England, they are\nnot always a very equal representation of the people, yet they approach\nmore nearly to that character; and as the executive power either has not\nthe means to corrupt them, or, on account of the support which it receives\nfrom the mother country, is not under the necessity of doing so, they are,\nperhaps, in general more influenced by the inclinations of their\nconstituents. The councils, which, in the colony legislatures, correspond\nto the house of lords in Great Britain, are not composed of a hereditary\nnobility. In some of the colonies, as in three of the governments of New\nEngland, those councils are not appointed by the king, but chosen by the\nrepresentatives of the people. In none of the English colonies is there\nany hereditary nobility. In all of them, indeed, as in all other free\ncountries, the descendant of an old colony family is more respected than\nan upstart of equal merit and fortune; but he is only more respected, and\nhe has no privileges by which he can be troublesome to his neighbours.\nBefore the commencement of the present disturbances, the colony assemblies\nhad not only the legislative, but a part of the executive power. In\nConnecticut and Rhode Island, they elected the governor. In the other\ncolonies, they appointed the revenue officers, who collected the taxes\nimposed by those respective assemblies, to whom those officers were\nimmediately responsible. There is more equality, therefore, among the\nEnglish colonists than among the inhabitants of the mother country. Their\nmanners are more re publican; and their governments, those of three of the\nprovinces of New England in particular, have hitherto been more republican\ntoo.\nThe absolute governments of Spain, Portugal, and France, on the contrary,\ntake place in their colonies; and the discretionary powers which such\ngovernments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers are, on\naccount of the great distance, naturally exercised there with more than\nordinary violence. Under all absolute governments, there is more liberty\nin the capital than in any other part of the country. The sovereign\nhimself can never have either interest or inclination to pervert the order\nof justice, or to oppress the great body of the people. In the capital,\nhis presence overawes, more or less, all his inferior officers, who, in\nthe remoter provinces, from whence the complaints of the people are less\nlikely to reach him, can exercise their tyranny with much more safety. But\nthe European colonies in America are more remote than the most distant\nprovinces of the greatest empires which had ever been known before. The\ngovernment of the English colonies is, perhaps, the only one which, since\nthe world began, could give perfect security to the inhabitants of so very\ndistant a province. The administration of the French colonies, however,\nhas always been conducted with much more gentleness and moderation than\nthat of the Spanish and Portuguese. This superiority of conduct is\nsuitable both to the character of the French nation, and to what forms the\ncharacter of every nation, the nature of their government, which, though\narbitrary and violent in comparison with that of Great Britain, is legal\nand free in comparison with those of Spain and Portugal.\nIt is in the progress of the North American colonies, however, that the\nsuperiority of the English policy chiefly appears. The progress of the\nsugar colonies of France has been at least equal, perhaps superior, to\nthat of the greater part of those of England; and yet the sugar colonies\nof England enjoy a free government, nearly of the same kind with that\nwhich takes place in her colonies of North America. But the sugar colonies\nof France are not discouraged, like those of England, from refining their\nown sugar; and what is still of greater importance, the genius of their\ngovernment naturally introduces a better management of their negro slaves.\nIn all European colonies, the culture of the sugar-cane is carried on by\nnegro slaves. The constitution of those who have been born in the\ntemperate climate of Europe could not, it is supposed, support the labour\nof digging the ground under the burning sun of the West Indies; and the\nculture of the sugar-cane, as it is managed at present, is all hand\nlabour; though, in the opinion of many, the drill plough might be\nintroduced into it with great advantage. But, as the profit and success of\nthe cultivation which is carried on by means of cattle, depend very much\nupon the good management of those cattle; so the profit and success of\nthat which is carried on by slaves must depend equally upon the good\nmanagement of those slaves; and in the good management of their slaves the\nFrench planters, I think it is generally allowed, are superior to the\nEnglish. The law, so far as it gives some weak protection to the slave\nagainst the violence of his master, is likely to be better executed in a\ncolony where the government is in a great measure arbitrary, than in one\nwhere it is altogether free. In every country where the unfortunate law\nof slavery is established, the magistrate, when he protects the slave,\nintermeddles in some measure in the management of the private property of\nthe master; and, in a free country, where the master is, perhaps, either a\nmember of the colony assembly, or an elector of such a member, he dares\nnot do this but with the greatest caution and circumspection. The respect\nwhich he is obliged to pay to the master, renders it more difficult for\nhim to protect the slave. But in a country where the government is in a\ngreat measure arbitrary, where it is usual for the magistrate to\nintermeddle even in the management of the private property of individuals,\nand to send them, perhaps, a lettre de cachet, if they do not manage it\naccording to his liking, it is much easier for him to give some protection\nto the slave; and common humanity naturally disposes him to do so. The\nprotection of the magistrate renders the slave less contemptible in the\neyes of his master, who is thereby induced to consider him with more\nregard, and to treat him with more gentleness. Gentle usage renders the\nslave not only more faithful, but more intelligent, and, therefore, upon a\ndouble account, more useful. He approaches more to the condition of a free\nservant, and may possess some degree of integrity and attachment to his\nmaster\u2019s interest; virtues which frequently belong to free servants, but\nwhich never can belong to a slave, who is treated as slaves commonly are\nin countries where the master is perfectly free and secure.\nThat the condition of a slave is better under an arbitrary than under a\nfree government, is, I believe, supported by the history of all ages and\nnations. In the Roman history, the first time we read of the magistrate\ninterposing to protect the slave from the violence of his master, is under\nthe emperors. When Vidius Pollio, in the presence of Augustus, ordered one\nof his slaves, who had committed a slight fault, to be cut into pieces and\nthrown into his fish-pond, in order to feed his fishes, the emperor\ncommanded him, with indignation, to emancipate immediately, not only that\nslave, but all the others that belonged to him. Under the republic no\nmagistrate could have had authority enough to protect the slave, much less\nto punish the master.\nThe stock, it is to be observed, which has improved the sugar colonies of\nFrance, particularly the great colony of St Domingo, has been raised\nalmost entirely from the gradual improvement and cultivation of those\ncolonies. It has been almost altogether the produce of the soil and of the\nindustry of the colonists, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of\nthat produce, gradually accumulated by good management, and employed in\nraising a still greater produce. But the stock which has improved and\ncultivated the sugar colonies of England, has, a great part of it, been\nsent out from England, and has by no means been altogether the produce of\nthe soil and industry of the colonists. The prosperity of the English\nsugar colonies has been in a great measure owing to the great riches of\nEngland, of which a part has overflowed, if one may say so, upon these\ncolonies. But the prosperity of the sugar colonies of France has been\nentirely owing to the good conduct of the colonists, which must therefore\nhave had some superiority over that of the English; and this superiority\nhas been remarked in nothing so much as in the good management of their\nslaves.\nSuch have been the general outlines of the policy of the different\nEuropean nations with regard to their colonies.\nThe policy of Europe, therefore, has very little to boast of, either in\nthe original establishment, or, so far as concerns their internal\ngovernment, in the subsequent prosperity of the colonies of America.\nFolly and injustice seem to have been the principles which presided over\nand directed the first project of establishing those colonies; the folly\nof hunting after gold and silver mines, and the injustice of coveting the\npossession of a country whose harmless natives, far from having ever\ninjured the people of Europe, had received the first adventurers with\nevery mark of kindness and hospitality.\nThe adventurers, indeed, who formed some of the latter establishments,\njoined to the chimerical project of finding gold and silver mines, other\nmotives more reasonable and more laudable; but even these motives do very\nlittle honour to the policy of Europe.\nThe English puritans, restrained at home, fled for freedom to America, and\nestablished there the four governments of New England. The English\ncatholics, treated with much greater injustice, established that of\nMaryland; the quakers, that of Pennsylvania. The Portuguese Jews,\npersecuted by the inquisition, stript of their fortunes, and banished to\nBrazil, introduced, by their example, some sort of order and industry\namong the transported felons and strumpets by whom that colony was\noriginally peopled, and taught them the culture of the sugar-cane. Upon\nall these different occasions, it was not the wisdom and policy, but the\ndisorder and injustice of the European governments, which peopled and\ncultivated America.\nIn effectuation some of the most important of these establishments, the\ndifferent governments of Europe had as little merit as in projecting them.\nThe conquest of Mexico was the project, not of the council of Spain, but\nof a governor of Cuba; and it was effectuated by the spirit of the bold\nadventurer to whom it was entrusted, in spite of every thing which that\ngovernor, who soon repented of having trusted such a person, could do to\nthwart it. The conquerors of Chili and Peru, and of almost all the other\nSpanish settlements upon the continent of America, carried out with them\nno other public encouragement, but a general permission to make\nsettlements and conquests in the name of the king of Spain. Those\nadventures were all at the private risk and expense of the adventurers.\nThe government of Spain contributed scarce any thing to any of them. That\nof England contributed as little towards effectuating the establishment of\nsome of its most important colonies in North America.\nWhen those establishments were effectuated, and had become so considerable\nas to attract the attention of the mother country, the first regulations\nwhich she made with regard to them, had always in view to secure to\nherself the monopoly of their commerce; to confine their market, and to\nenlarge her own at their expense, and, consequently, rather to damp and\ndiscourage, than to quicken and forward the course of their prosperity. In\nthe different ways in which this monopoly has been exercised, consists one\nof the most essential differences in the policy of the different European\nnations with regard to their colonies. The best of them all, that of\nEngland, is only somewhat less illiberal and oppressive than that of any\nof the rest.\nIn what way, therefore, has the policy of Europe contributed either to the\nfirst establishment, or to the present grandeur of the colonies of\nAmerica? In one way, and in one way only, it has contributed a good deal.\nMagna virum mater! It bred and formed the men who were capable of\nachieving such great actions, and of laying the foundation of so great an\nempire; and there is no other quarter of the world; of which the policy is\ncapable of forming, or has ever actually, and in fact, formed such men.\nThe colonies owe to the policy of Europe the education and great views of\ntheir active and enterprizing founders; and some of the greatest and most\nimportant of them, so far as concerns their internal government, owe to it\nscarce anything else.\nPART III. Of the Advantages which Europe has derived From the Discovery of\nAmerica, and from that of a Passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good\nHope.\nSuch are the advantages which the colonies of America have derived from\nthe policy of Europe.\nWhat are those which Europe has derived from the discovery and\ncolonization of America?\nThose advantages may be divided, first, into the general advantages which\nEurope, considered as one great country, has derived from those great\nevents; and, secondly, into the particular advantages which each\ncolonizing country has derived from the colonies which particularly belong\nto it, in consequence of the authority or dominion which it exercises over\nthem.\nThe general advantages which Europe, considered as one great country, has\nderived from the discovery and colonization of America, consist, first, in\nthe increase of its enjoyments; and, secondly, in the augmentation of its\nindustry.\nThe surplus produce of America imported into Europe, furnishes the\ninhabitants of this great continent with a variety of commodities which\nthey could not otherwise have possessed; some for conveniency and use,\nsome for pleasure, and some for ornament; and thereby contributes to\nincrease their enjoyments.\nThe discovery and colonization of America, it will readily be allowed,\nhave contributed to augment the industry, first, of all the countries\nwhich trade to it directly, such as Spain, Portugal, France, and England;\nand, secondly, of all those which, without trading to it directly, send,\nthrough the medium of other countries, goods to it of their own produce,\nsuch as Austrian Flanders, and some provinces of Germany, which, through\nthe medium of the countries before mentioned, send to it a considerable\nquantity of linen and other goods. All such countries have evidently\ngained a more extensive market for their surplus produce, and must\nconsequently have been encouraged to increase its quantity.\nBut that those great events should likewise have contributed to encourage\nthe industry of countries such as Hungary and Poland, which may never,\nperhaps, have sent a single commodity of their own produce to America, is\nnot, perhaps, altogether so evident. That those events have done so,\nhowever, cannot be doubted. Some part of the produce of America is\nconsumed in Hungary and Poland, and there is some demand there for the\nsugar, chocolate, and tobacco, of that new quarter of the world. But those\ncommodities must be purchased with something which is either the produce\nof the industry of Hungary and Poland, or with something which had been\npurchased with some part of that produce. Those commodities of America are\nnew values, new equivalents, introduced into Hungary and Poland, to be\nexchanged there for the surplus produce of these countries. By being\ncarried thither, they create a new and more extensive market for that\nsurplus produce. They raise its value, and thereby contribute to encourage\nits increase. Though no part of it may ever be carried to America, it may\nbe carried to other countries, which purchase it with a part of their\nshare of the surplus produce of America, and it may find a market by means\nof the circulation of that trade which was originally put into motion by\nthe surplus produce of America.\nThose great events may even have contributed to increase the enjoyments,\nand to augment the industry, of countries which not only never sent any\ncommodities to America, but never received any from it. Even such\ncountries may have received a greater abundance of other commodities from\ncountries, of which the surplus produce had been augmented by means of the\nAmerican trade. This greater abundance, as it must necessarily have\nincreased their enjoyments, so it must likewise have augmented their\nindustry. A greater number of new equivalents, of some kind or other, must\nhave been presented to them to be exchanged for the surplus produce of\nthat industry. A more extensive market must have been created for that\nsurplus produce, so as to raise its value, and thereby encourage its\nincrease. The mass of commodities annually thrown into the great circle of\nEuropean commerce, and by its various revolutions annually distributed\namong all the different nations comprehended within it, must have been\naugmented by the whole surplus produce of America. A greater share of this\ngreater mass, therefore, is likely to have fallen to each of those\nnations, to have increased their enjoyments, and augmented their industry.\nThe exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to diminish, or at least\nto keep down below what they would otherwise rise to, both the enjoyments\nand industry of all those nations in general, and of the American colonies\nin particular. It is a dead weight upon the action of one of the great\nsprings which puts into motion a great part of the business of mankind. By\nrendering the colony produce dearer in all other countries, it lessens its\nconsumption, and thereby cramps the industry of the colonies, and both the\nenjoyments and the industry of all other countries, which both enjoy less\nwhen they pay more for what they enjoy, and produce less when they get\nless for what they produce. By rendering the produce of all other\ncountries dearer in the colonies, it cramps in the same manner the\nindustry of all other colonies, and both the enjoyments and the industry\nof the colonies. It is a clog which, for the supposed benefit of some\nparticular countries, embarrasses the pleasures and encumbers the industry\nof all other countries, but of the colonies more than of any other. It not\nonly excludes as much as possible all other countries from one particular\nmarket, but it confines as much as possible the colonies to one particular\nmarket; and the difference is very great between being excluded from one\nparticular market when all others are open, and being confined to one\nparticular market when all others are shut up. The surplus produce of the\ncolonies, however, is the original source of all that increase of\nenjoyments and industry which Europe derives from the discovery and\ncolonization of America, and the exclusive trade of the mother countries\ntends to render this source much less abundant than it otherwise would be.\nThe particular advantages which each colonizing country derives from the\ncolonies which particularly belong to it, are of two different kinds;\nfirst, those common advantages which every empire derives from the\nprovinces subject to its dominion; and, secondly, those peculiar\nadvantages which are supposed to result from provinces of so very peculiar\na nature as the European colonies of America.\nThe common advantages which every empire derives from the provinces\nsubject to its dominion consist, first, in the military force which they\nfurnish for its defence; and, secondly, in the revenue which they furnish\nfor the support of its civil government. The Roman colonies furnished\noccasionally both the one and the other. The Greek colonies sometimes\nfurnished a military force, but seldom any revenue. They seldom\nacknowledged themselves subject to the dominion of the mother city. They\nwere generally her allies in war, but very seldom her subjects in peace.\nThe European colonies of America have never yet furnished any military\nforce for the defence of the mother country. The military force has never\nyet been sufficient for their own defence; and in the different wars in\nwhich the mother countries have been engaged, the defence of their\ncolonies has generally occasioned a very considerable distraction of the\nmilitary force of those countries. In this respect, therefore, all the\nEuropean colonies have, without exception, been a cause rather of weakness\nthan of strength to their respective mother countries.\nThe colonies of Spain and Portugal only have contributed any revenue\ntowards the defence of the mother country, or the support of her civil\ngovernment. The taxes which have been levied upon those of other European\nnations, upon those of England in particular, have seldom been equal to\nthe expense laid out upon them in time of peace, and never sufficient to\ndefray that which they occasioned in time of war. Such colonies,\ntherefore, have been a source of expense, and not of revenue, to their\nrespective mother countries.\nThe advantages of such colonies to their respective mother countries,\nconsist altogether in those peculiar advantages which are supposed to\nresult from provinces of so very peculiar a nature as the European\ncolonies of America; and the exclusive trade, it is acknowledged, is the\nsole source of all those peculiar advantages.\nIn consequence of this exclusive trade, all that part of the surplus\nproduce of the English colonies, for example, which consists in what are\ncalled enumerated commodities, can be sent to no other country but\nEngland. Other countries must afterwards buy it of her. It must be\ncheaper, therefore, in England than it can be in any other country, and\nmust contribute more to increase the enjoyments of England than those of\nany other country. It must likewise contribute more to encourage her\nindustry. For all those parts of her own surplus produce which England\nexchanges for those enumerated commodities, she must get a better price\nthan any other countries can get for the like parts of theirs, when they\nexchange them for the same commodities. The manufactures of England, for\nexample, will purchase a greater quantity of the sugar and tobacco of her\nown colonies than the like manufactures of other countries can purchase of\nthat sugar and tobacco. So far, therefore, as the manufactures of England\nand those of other countries are both to be exchanged for the sugar and\ntobacco of the English colonies, this superiority of price gives an\nencouragement to the former beyond what the latter can, in these\ncircumstances, enjoy. The exclusive trade of the colonies, therefore, as\nit diminishes, or at least keeps down below what they would otherwise rise\nto, both the enjoyments and the industry of the countries which do not\npossess it, so it gives an evident advantage to the countries which do\npossess it over those other countries.\nThis advantage, however, will, perhaps, be found to be rather what may be\ncalled a relative than an absolute advantage, and to give a superiority to\nthe country which enjoys it, rather by depressing the industry and produce\nof other countries, than by raising those of that particular country above\nwhat they would naturally rise to in the case of a free trade.\nThe tobacco of Maryland and Virginia, for example, by means of the\nmonopoly which England enjoys of it, certainly comes cheaper to England\nthan it can do to France to whom England commonly sells a considerable\npart of it. But had France and all other European countries been at all\ntimes allowed a free trade to Maryland and Virginia, the tobacco of those\ncolonies might by this time have come cheaper than it actually does, not\nonly to all those other countries, but likewise to England. The produce of\ntobacco, in consequence of a market so much more extensive than any which\nit has hitherto enjoyed, might, and probably would, by this time have been\nso much increased as to reduce the profits of a tobacco plantation to\ntheir natural level with those of a corn plantation, which it is supposed\nthey are still somewhat above. The price of tobacco might, and probably\nwould, by this time have fallen somewhat lower than it is at present. An\nequal quantity of the commodities, either of England or of those other\ncountries, might have purchased in Maryland and Virginia a greater\nquantity of tobacco than it can do at present, and consequently have been\nsold there for so much a better price. So far as that weed, therefore,\ncan, by its cheapness and abundance, increase the enjoyments, or augment\nthe industry, either of England or of any other country, it would\nprobably, in the case of a free trade, have produced both these effects in\nsomewhat a greater degree than it can do at present. England, indeed,\nwould not, in this case, have had any advantage over other countries. She\nmight have bought the tobacco of her colonies somewhat cheaper, and\nconsequently have sold some of her own commodities somewhat dearer, than\nshe actually does; but she could neither have bought the one cheaper, nor\nsold the other dearer, than any other country might have done. She might,\nperhaps, have gained an absolute, but she would certainly have lost a\nrelative advantage.\nIn order, however, to obtain this relative advantage in the colony trade,\nin order to execute the invidious and malignant project of excluding, as\nmuch as possible, other nations from any share in it, England, there are\nvery probable reasons for believing, has not only sacrificed a part of the\nabsolute advantage which she, as well as every other nation, might have\nderived from that trade, but has subjected herself both to an absolute and\nto a relative disadvantage in almost every other branch of trade.\nWhen, by the act of navigation, England assumed to herself the monopoly of\nthe colony trade, the foreign capitals which had before been employed in\nit, were necessarily withdrawn from it. The English capital, which had\nbefore carried on but a part of it, was now to carry on the whole. The\ncapital which had before supplied the colonies with but a part of the\ngoods which they wanted from Europe, was now all that was employed to\nsupply them with the whole. But it could not supply them with the whole;\nand the goods with which it did supply them were necessarily sold very\ndear. The capital which had before bought but a part of the surplus\nproduce of the colonies, was now all that was employed to buy the whole.\nBut it could not buy the whole at any thing near the old price; and\ntherefore, whatever it did buy, it necessarily bought very cheap. But in\nan employment of capital, in which the merchant sold very dear, and bought\nvery cheap, the profit must have been very great, and much above the\nordinary level of profit in other branches of trade. This superiority of\nprofit in the colony trade could not fail to draw from other branches of\ntrade a part of the capital which had before been employed in them. But\nthis revulsion of capital, as it must have gradually increased the\ncompetition of capitals in the colony trade, so it must have gradually\ndiminished that competition in all those other branches of trade; as it\nmust have gradually lowered the profits of the one, so it must have\ngradually raised those of the other, till the profits of all came to a new\nlevel, different from, and somewhat higher, than that at which they had\nbeen before.\nThis double effect of drawing capital from all other trades, and of\nraising the rate of profit somewhat higher than it otherwise would have\nbeen in all trades, was not only produced by this monopoly upon its first\nestablishment, but has continued to be produced by it ever since.\nFirst, This monopoly has been continually drawing capital from all other\ntrades, to be employed in that of the colonies.\nThough the wealth of Great Britain has increased very much since the\nestablishment of the act of navigation, it certainly has not increased in\nthe same proportion as that or the colonies. But the foreign trade of\nevery country naturally increases in proportion to its wealth, its surplus\nproduce in proportion to its whole produce; and Great Britain having\nengrossed to herself almost the whole of what may be called the foreign\ntrade of the colonies, and her capital not having increased in the same\nproportion as the extent of that trade, she could not carry it on without\ncontinually withdrawing from other branches of trade some part of the\ncapital which had before been employed in them, as well as withholding\nfrom them a great deal more which would otherwise have gone to them. Since\nthe establishment of the act of navigation, accordingly, the colony trade\nhas been continually increasing, while many other branches of foreign\ntrade, particularly of that to other parts of Europe, have been\ncontinually decaying. Our manufactures for foreign sale, instead of being\nsuited, as before the act of navigation, to the neighbouring market of\nEurope, or to the more distant one of the countries which lie round the\nMediterranean sea, have the greater part of them, been accommodated to the\nstill more distant one of the colonies; to the market in which they have\nthe monopoly, rather than to that in which they have many competitors. The\ncauses of decay in other branches of foreign trade, which, by Sir Matthew\nDecker and other writers, have been sought for in the excess and improper\nmode of taxation, in the high price of labour, in the increase of luxury,\netc. may all be found in the overgrowth of the colony trade. The\nmercantile capital of Great Britain, though very great, yet not being\ninfinite, and though greatly increased since the act of navigation, yet\nnot being increased in the same proportion as the colony trade, that trade\ncould not possibly be carried on without withdrawing some part of that\ncapital from other branches of trade, nor consequently without some decay\nof those other branches.\nEngland, it must be observed, was a great trading country, her mercantile\ncapital was very great, and likely to become still greater and greater\nevery day, not only before the act of navigation had established the\nmonopoly of the corn trade, but before that trade was very considerable.\nIn the Dutch war, during the government of Cromwell, her navy was superior\nto that of Holland; and in that which broke out in the beginning of the\nreign of Charles II., it was at least equal, perhaps superior to the\nunited navies of France and Holland. Its superiority, perhaps, would\nscarce appear greater in the present times, at least if the Dutch navy\nwere to bear the same proportion to the Dutch commerce now which it did\nthen. But this great naval power could not, in either of those wars, be\nowing to the act of navigation. During the first of them, the plan of that\nact had been but just formed; and though, before the breaking out of the\nsecond, it had been fully enacted by legal authority, yet no part of it\ncould have had time to produce any considerable effect, and least of all\nthat part which established the exclusive trade to the colonies. Both the\ncolonies and their trade were inconsiderable then, in comparison of what\nthey are how. The island of Jamaica was an unwholesome desert, little\ninhabited, and less cultivated. New York and New Jersey were in the\npossession of the Dutch, the half of St. Christopher\u2019s in that of the\nFrench. The island of Antigua, the two Carolinas, Pennsylvania, Georgia,\nand Nova Scotia, were not planted. Virginia, Maryland, and New England\nwere planted; and though they were very thriving colonies, yet there was\nnot perhaps at that time, either in Europe or America, a single person who\nforesaw, or even suspected, the rapid progress which they have since made\nin wealth, population, and improvement. The island of Barbadoes, in short,\nwas the only British colony of any consequence, of which the condition at\nthat time bore any resemblance to what it is at present. The trade of the\ncolonies, of which England, even for some time after the act of\nnavigation, enjoyed but a part (for the act of navigation was not very\nstrictly executed till several years after it was enacted), could not at\nthat time be the cause of the great trade of England, nor of the great\nnaval power which was supported by that trade. The trade which at that\ntime supported that great naval power was the trade of Europe, and of the\ncountries which lie round the Mediterranean sea. But the share which Great\nBritain at present enjoys of that trade could not support any such great\nnaval power. Had the growing trade of the colonies been left free to all\nnations, whatever share of it might have fallen to Great Britain, and a\nvery considerable share would probably have fallen to her, must have been\nall an addition to this great trade of which she was before in possession.\nIn consequence of the monopoly, the increase of the colony trade has not\nso much occasioned an addition to the trade which Great Britain had\nbefore, as a total change in its direction.\nSecondly, This monopoly has necessarily contributed to keep up the rate of\nprofit, in all the different branches of British trade, higher than it\nnaturally would have been, had all nations been allowed a free trade to\nthe British colonies.\nThe monopoly of the colony trade, as it necessarily drew towards that\ntrade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would\nhave gone to it of its own accord, so, by the expulsion of all foreign\ncapitals, it necessarily reduced the whole quantity of capital employed in\nthat trade below what it naturally would have been in the case of a free\ntrade. But, by lessening the competition of capitals in that branch of\ntrade, it necessarily raised the rate of profit in that branch. By\nlessening, too, the competition of British capitals in all other branches\nof trade, it necessarily raised the rate of British profit in all those\nother branches. Whatever may have been, at any particular period since the\nestablishment of the act of navigation, the state or extent of the\nmercantile capital of Great Britain, the monopoly of the colony trade\nmust, during the continuance of that state, have raised the ordinary rate\nof British profit higher than it otherwise would have been, both in that\nand in all the other branches of British trade. If, since the\nestablishment of the act of navigation, the ordinary rate of British\nprofit has fallen considerably, as it certainly has, it must have fallen\nstill lower, had not the monopoly established by that act contributed to\nkeep it up.\nBut whatever raises, in any country, the ordinary rate of profit higher\nthan it otherwise would be, necessarily subjects that country both to an\nabsolute, and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of which\nshe has not the monopoly.\nIt subjects her to an absolute disadvantage; because, in such branches of\ntrade, her merchants cannot get this greater profit without selling dearer\nthan they otherwise would do, both the goods of foreign countries which\nthey import into their own, and the goods of their own country which they\nexport to foreign countries. Their own country must both buy dearer and\nsell dearer; must both buy less, and sell less; must both enjoy less and\nproduce less, than she otherwise would do.\nIt subjects her to a relative disadvantage; because, in such branches of\ntrade, it sets other countries, which are not subject to the same absolute\ndisadvantage, either more above her or less below her, than they otherwise\nwould be. It enables them both to enjoy more and to produce more, in\nproportion to what she enjoys and produces. It renders their superiority\ngreater, or their inferiority less, than it otherwise would be. By raising\nthe price of her produce above what it otherwise would be, it enables the\nmerchants of other countries to undersell her in foreign markets, and\nthereby to justle her out of almost all those branches of trade, of which\nshe has not the monopoly.\nOur merchants frequently complain of the high wages of British labour, as\nthe cause of their manufactures being undersold in foreign markets; but\nthey are silent about the high profits of stock. They complain of the\nextravagant gain of other people; but they say nothing of their own. The\nhigh profits of British stock, however, may contribute towards raising the\nprice of British manufactures, in many cases, as much, and in some perhaps\nmore, than the high wages of British labour.\nIt is in this manner that the capital of Great Britain, one may justly\nsay, has partly been drawn and partly been driven from the greater part of\nthe different branches of trade of which she has not the monopoly; from\nthe trade of Europe, in particular, and from that of the countries which\nlie round the Mediterranean sea.\nIt has partly been drawn from those branches of trade, by the attraction\nof superior profit in the colony trade, in consequence of the continual\nincrease of that trade, and of the continual insufficiency of the capital\nwhich had carried it on one year to carry it on the next.\nIt has partly been driven from them, by the advantage which the high rate\nof profit established in Great Britain gives to other countries, in all\nthe different branches of trade of which Great Britain has not the\nmonopoly.\nAs the monopoly of the colony trade has drawn from those other branches a\npart of the British capital, which would otherwise have been employed in\nthem, so it has forced into them many foreign capitals which would never\nhave gone to them, had they not been expelled from the colony trade. In\nthose other branches of trade, it has diminished the competition of\nBritish capitals, and thereby raised the rate of British profit higher\nthan it otherwise would have been. On the contrary, it has increased the\ncompetition of foreign capitals, and thereby sunk the rate of foreign\nprofit lower than it otherwise would have been. Both in the one way and in\nthe other, it must evidently have subjected Great Britain to a relative\ndisadvantage in all those other branches of trade.\nThe colony trade, however, it may perhaps be said, is more advantageous to\nGreat Britain than any other; and the monopoly, by forcing into that trade\na greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would\notherwise have gone to it, has turned that capital into an employment,\nmore advantageous to the country than any other which it could have found.\nThe most advantageous employment of any capital to the country to which it\nbelongs, is that which maintains there the greatest quantity of productive\nlabour, and increases the most the annual produce of the land and labour\nof that country. But the quantity of productive labour which any capital\nemployed in the foreign trade of consumption can maintain, is exactly in\nproportion, it has been shown in the second book, to the frequency of its\nreturns. A capital of a thousand pounds, for example, employed in a\nforeign trade of consumption, of which the returns are made regularly once\nin the year, can keep in constant employment, in the country to which it\nbelongs, a quantity of productive labour, equal to what a thousand pounds\ncan maintain there for a year. If the returns are made twice or thrice in\nthe year, it can keep in constant employment a quantity of productive\nlabour, equal to what two or three thousand pounds can maintain there for\na year. A foreign trade of consumption carried on with a neighbouring, is,\nupon that account, in general, more advantageous than one carried on with\na distant country; and, for the same reason, a direct foreign trade of\nconsumption, as it has likewise been shown in the second book, is in\ngeneral more advantageous than a round-about one.\nBut the monopoly of the colony trade, so far as it has operated upon the\nemployment of the capital of Great Britain, has, in all cases, forced some\npart of it from a foreign trade of consumption carried on with a\nneighbouring, to one carried on with a more distant country, and in many\ncases from a direct foreign trade of consumption to a round-about one.\nFirst, The monopoly of the colony trade has, in all cases, forced some\npart of the capital of Great Britain from a foreign trade of consumption\ncarried on with a neighbouring, to one carried on with a more distant\ncountry.\nIt has, in all cases, forced some part of that capital from the trade with\nEurope, and with the countries which lie round the Mediterranean sea, to\nthat with the more distant regions of America and the West Indies; from\nwhich the returns are necessarily less frequent, not only on account of\nthe greater distance, but on account of the peculiar circumstances of\nthose countries. New colonies, it has already been observed, are always\nunderstocked. Their capital is always much less than what they could\nemploy with great profit and advantage in the improvement and cultivation\nof their land. They have a constant demand, therefore, for more capital\nthan they have of their own; and, in order to supply the deficiency of\ntheir own, they endeavour to borrow as much as they can of the mother\ncountry, to whom they are, therefore, always in debt. The most common way\nin which the colonies contract this debt, is not by borrowing upon bond of\nthe rich people of the mother country, though they sometimes do this too,\nbut by running as much in arrear to their correspondents, who supply them\nwith goods from Europe, as those correspondents will allow them. Their\nannual returns frequently do not amount to more than a third, and\nsometimes not to so great a proportion of what they owe. The whole\ncapital, therefore, which their correspondents advance to them, is seldom\nreturned to Britain in less than three, and sometimes not in less than\nfour or five years. But a British capital of a thousand pounds, for\nexample, which is returned to Great Britain only once in five years, can\nkeep in constant employment only one-fifth part of the British industry\nwhich it could maintain, if the whole was returned once in the year; and,\ninstead of the quantity of industry which a thousand pounds could maintain\nfor a year, can keep in constant employment the quantity only which two\nhundred pounds can maintain for a year. The planter, no doubt, by the high\nprice which he pays for the goods from Europe, by the interest upon the\nbills which he grants at distant dates, and by the commission upon the\nrenewal of those which he grants at near dates, makes up, and probably\nmore than makes up, all the loss which his correspondent can sustain by\nthis delay. But, though he make up the loss of his correspondent, he\ncannot make up that of Great Britain. In a trade of which the returns are\nvery distant, the profit of the merchant may be as great or greater than\nin one in which they are very frequent and near; but the advantage of the\ncountry in which he resides, the quantity of productive labour constantly\nmaintained there, the annual produce of the land and labour, must always\nbe much less. That the returns of the trade to America, and still more\nthose of that to the West Indies, are, in general, not only more distant,\nbut more irregular and more uncertain, too, than those of the trade to any\npart of Europe, or even of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean\nsea, will readily be allowed, I imagine, by everybody who has any\nexperience of those different branches of trade.\nSecondly, The monopoly of the colony trade, has, in many cases, forced\nsome part of the capital of Great Britain from a direct foreign trade of\nconsumption, into a round-about one.\nAmong the enumerated commodities which can be sent to no other market but\nGreat Britain, there are several of which the quantity exceeds very much\nthe consumption of Great Britain, and of which, a part, therefore, must be\nexported to other countries. But this cannot be done without forcing some\npart of the capital of Great Britain into a round-about foreign trade of\nconsumption. Maryland, and Virginia, for example, send annually to Great\nBritain upwards of ninety-six thousand hogsheads of tobacco, and the\nconsumption of Great Britain is said not to exceed fourteen thousand.\nUpwards of eighty-two thousand hogsheads, therefore, must be exported to\nother countries, to France, to Holland, and, to the countries which lie\nround the Baltic and Mediterranean seas. But that part of the capital of\nGreat Britain which brings those eighty-two thousand hogsheads to Great\nBritain, which re-exports them from thence to those other countries, and\nwhich brings back from those other countries to Great Britain either goods\nor money in return, is employed in a round-about foreign trade of\nconsumption; and is necessarily forced into this employment, in order to\ndispose of this great surplus. If we would compute in how many years the\nwhole of this capital is likely to come back to Great Britain, we must add\nto the distance of the American returns that of the returns from those\nother countries. If, in the direct foreign trade of consumption which we\ncarry on with America, the whole capital employed frequently does not come\nback in less than three or four years, the whole capital employed in this\nround-about one is not likely to come back in less than four or five. If\nthe one can keep in constant employment but a third or a fourth part of\nthe domestic industry which could be maintained by a capital returned once\nin the year, the other can keep in constant employment but a fourth or a\nfifth part of that industry. At some of the outports a credit is commonly\ngiven to those foreign correspondents to whom they export them tobacco. At\nthe port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money: the rule\nis Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of\nthe whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from\nAmerica, by the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse;\nwhere, however, they may sometimes lie long enough. But, had not the\ncolonies been confined to the market of Great Britain for the sale of\ntheir tobacco, very little more of it would probably have come to us than\nwhat was necessary for the home consumption. The goods which Great Britain\npurchases at present for her own consumption with the great surplus of\ntobacco which she exports to other countries, she would, in this case,\nprobably have purchased with the immediate produce of her own industry, or\nwith some part of her own manufactures. That produce, those manufactures,\ninstead of being almost entirely suited to one great market, as at\npresent, would probably have been fitted to a great number of smaller\nmarkets. Instead of one great round-about foreign trade of consumption,\nGreat Britain would probably have carried on a great number of small\ndirect foreign trades of the same kind. On account of the frequency of the\nreturns, a part, and probably but a small part, perhaps not above a third\nor a fourth of the capital which at present carries on this great\nround-about trade, might have been sufficient to carry on all those small\ndirect ones; might have kept in constant employment an equal quantity of\nBritish industry; and have equally supported the annual produce of the\nland and labour of Great Britain. All the purposes of this trade being, in\nthis manner, answered by a much smaller capital, there would have been a\nlarge spare capital to apply to other purposes; to improve the lands, to\nincrease the manufactures, and to extend the commerce of Great Britain; to\ncome into competition at least with the other British capitals employed in\nall those different ways, to reduce the rate of profit in them all, and\nthereby to give to Great Britain, in all of them, a superiority over other\ncountries, still greater than what she at present enjoys.\nThe monopoly of the colony trade, too, has forced some part of the capital\nof Great Britain from all foreign trade of consumption to a carrying\ntrade; and, consequently from supporting more or less the industry of\nGreat Britain, to be employed altogether in supporting partly that of the\ncolonies, and partly that of some other countries.\nThe goods, for example, which are annually purchased with the great\nsurplus of eighty-two thousand hogsheads of tobacco annually re-exported\nfrom Great Britain, are not all consumed in Great Britain. Part of them,\nlinen from Germany and Holland, for example, is returned to the colonies\nfor their particular consumption. But that part of the capital of Great\nBritain which buys the tobacco with which this linen is afterwards bought,\nis necessarily withdrawn from supporting the industry of Great Britain, to\nbe employed altogether in supporting, partly that of the colonies, and\npartly that of the particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the\nproduce of their own industry.\nThe monopoly of the colony trade, besides, by forcing towards it a much\ngreater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would\nnaturally have gone to it, seems to have broken altogether that natural\nbalance which would otherwise have taken place among all the different\nbranches of British industry. The industry of Great Britain, instead of\nbeing accommodated to a great number of small markets, has been\nprincipally suited to one great market. Her commerce, instead of running\nin a great number of small channels, has been taught to run principally in\none great channel. But the whole system of her industry and commerce has\nthereby been rendered less secure; the whole state of her body politic\nless healthful than it otherwise would have been. In her present\ncondition, Great Britain resembles one of those unwholesome bodies in\nwhich some of the vital parts are overgrown, and which, upon that account,\nare liable to many dangerous disorders, scarce incident to those in which\nall the parts are more properly proportioned. A small stop in that great\nblood-vessel, which has been artificially swelled beyond its natural\ndimensions, and through which an unnatural proportion of the industry and\ncommerce of the country has been forced to circulate, is very likely to\nbring on the most dangerous disorders upon the whole body politic. The\nexpectation of a rupture with the colonies, accordingly, has struck the\npeople of Great Britain with more terror than they ever felt for a Spanish\narmada, or a French invasion. It was this terror, whether well or ill\ngrounded, which rendered the repeal of the stamp act, among the merchants\nat least, a popular measure. In the total exclusion from the colony\nmarket, was it to last only for a few years, the greater part of our\nmerchants used to fancy that they foresaw an entire stop to their trade;\nthe greater part of our master manufacturers, the entire ruin of their\nbusiness; and the greater part of our workmen, an end of their employment.\nA rupture with any of our neighbours upon the continent, though likely,\ntoo, to occasion some stop or interruption in the employments of some of\nall these different orders of people, is foreseen, however, without any\nsuch general emotion. The blood, of which the circulation is stopt in some\nof the smaller vessels, easily disgorges itself into the greater, without\noccasioning any dangerous disorder; but, when it is stopt in any of the\ngreater vessels, convulsions, apoplexy, or death, are the immediate and\nunavoidable consequences. If but one of those overgrown manufactures,\nwhich, by means either of bounties or of the monopoly of the home and\ncolony markets, have been artificially raised up to any unnatural height,\nfinds some small stop or interruption in its employment, it frequently\noccasions a mutiny and disorder alarming to government, and embarrassing\neven to the deliberations of the legislature. How great, therefore, would\nbe the disorder and confusion, it was thought, which must necessarily be\noccasioned by a sudden and entire stop in the employment of so great a\nproportion of our principal manufacturers?\nSome moderate and gradual relaxation of the laws which give to Great\nBritain the exclusive trade to the colonies, till it is rendered in a\ngreat measure free, seems to be the only expedient which can, in all\nfuture times, deliver her from this danger; which can enable her, or even\nforce her, to withdraw some part of her capital from this overgrown\nemployment, and to turn it, though with less profit, towards other\nemployments; and which, by gradually diminishing one branch of her\nindustry, and gradually increasing all the rest, can, by degrees, restore\nall the different branches of it to that natural, healthful, and proper\nproportion, which perfect liberty necessarily establishes, and which\nperfect liberty can alone preserve. To open the colony trade all at once\nto all nations, might not only occasion some transitory inconveniency, but\na great permanent loss, to the greater part of those whose industry or\ncapital is at present engaged in it. The sudden loss of the employment,\neven of the ships which import the eighty-two thousand hogsheads of\ntobacco, which are over and above the consumption of Great Britain, might\nalone be felt very sensibly. Such are the unfortunate effects of all the\nregulations of the mercantile system. They not only introduce very\ndangerous disorders into the state of the body politic, but disorders\nwhich it is often difficult to remedy, without occasioning, for a time at\nleast, still greater disorders. In what manner, therefore, the colony\ntrade ought gradually to be opened; what are the restraints which ought\nfirst, and what are those which ought last, to be taken away; or in what\nmanner the natural system of perfect liberty and justice ought gradually\nto be restored, we must leave to the wisdom of future statesmen and\nlegislators to determine.\nFive different events, unforeseen and unthought of, have very fortunately\nconcurred to hinder Great Britain from feeling, so sensibly as it was\ngenerally expected she would, the total exclusion which has now taken\nplace for more than a year (from the first of December 1774) from a very\nimportant branch of the colony trade, that of the twelve associated\nprovinces of North America. First, those colonies, in preparing themselves\nfor their non-importation agreement, drained Great Britain completely of\nall the commodities which were fit for their market; secondly, the extra\nordinary demand of the Spanish flota has, this year, drained Germany and\nthe north of many commodities, linen in particular, which used to come\ninto competition, even in the British market, with the manufactures of\nGreat Britain; thirdly, the peace between Russia and Turkey has occasioned\nan extraordinary demand from the Turkey market, which, during the distress\nof the country, and while a Russian fleet was cruizing in the Archipelago,\nhad been very poorly supplied; fourthly, the demand of the north of Europe\nfor the manufactures of Great Britain has been increasing from year to\nyear, for some time past; and, fifthly, the late partition, and\nconsequential pacification of Poland, by opening the market of that great\ncountry, have, this year, added an extraordinary demand from thence to the\nincreasing demand of the north. These events are all, except the fourth,\nin their nature transitory and accidental; and the exclusion from so\nimportant a branch of the colony trade, if unfortunately it should\ncontinue much longer, may still occasion some degree of distress. This\ndistress, however, as it will come on gradually, will be felt much less\nseverely than if it had come on all at once; and, in the mean time, the\nindustry and capital of the country may find a new employment and\ndirection, so as to prevent this distress from ever rising to any\nconsiderable height.\nThe monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, so far as it has turned\ntowards that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain\nthan what would otherwise have gone to it, has in all cases turned it,\nfrom a foreign trade of consumption with a neighbouring, into one with a\nmore distant country; in many cases from a direct foreign trade of\nconsumption into a round-about one; and, in some cases, from all foreign\ntrade of consumption into a carrying trade. It has, in all cases,\ntherefore, turned it from a direction in which it would have maintained a\ngreater quantity of productive labour, into one in which it can maintain a\nmuch smaller quantity. By suiting, besides, to one particular market only,\nso great a part of the industry and commerce of Great Britain, it has\nrendered the whole state of that industry and commerce more precarious and\nless secure, than if their produce had been accommodated to a greater\nvariety of markets.\nWe must carefully distinguish between the effects of the colony trade and\nthose of the monopoly of that trade. The former are always and necessarily\nbeneficial; the latter always and necessarily hurtful. But the former are\nso beneficial, that the colony trade, though subject to a monopoly, and,\nnotwithstanding the hurtful effects of that monopoly, is still, upon the\nwhole, beneficial, and greatly beneficial, though a good deal less so than\nit otherwise would be.\nThe effect of the colony trade, in its natural and free state, is to open\na great though distant market, for such parts of the produce of British\nindustry as may exceed the demand of the markets nearer home, of those of\nEurope, and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean sea. In its\nnatural and free state, the colony trade, without drawing from those\nmarkets any part of the produce which had ever been sent to them,\nencourages Great Britain to increase the surplus continually, by\ncontinually presenting new equivalents to be exchanged for it. In its\nnatural and free state, the colony trade tends to increase the quantity of\nproductive labour in Great Britain, but without altering in any respect\nthe direction of that which had been employed there before. In the natural\nand free state of the colony trade, the competition of all other nations\nwould hinder the rate of profit from rising above the common level, either\nin the new market, or in the new employment. The new market, without\ndrawing any thing from the old one, would create, if one may say so, a new\nproduce for its own supply; and that new produce would constitute a new\ncapital for carrying on the new employment, which, in the same manner,\nwould draw nothing from the old one.\nThe monopoly of the colony trade, on the contrary, by excluding the\ncompetition of other nations, and thereby raising the rate of profit, both\nin the new market and in the new employment, draws produce from the old\nmarket, and capital from the old employment. To augment our share of the\ncolony trade beyond what it otherwise would be, is the avowed purpose of\nthe monopoly. If our share of that trade were to be no greater with, than\nit would have been without the monopoly, there could have been no reason\nfor establishing the monopoly. But whatever forces into a branch of trade,\nof which the returns are slower and more distant than those of the greater\npart of other trades, a greater proportion of the capital of any country,\nthan what of its own accord would go to that branch, necessarily renders\nthe whole quantity of productive labour annually maintained there, the\nwhole annual produce of the land and labour of that country, less than\nthey otherwise would be. It keeps down the revenue of the inhabitants of\nthat country below what it would naturally rise to, and thereby diminishes\ntheir power of accumulation. It not only hinders, at all times, their\ncapital from maintaining so great a quantity of productive labour as it\nwould otherwise maintain, but it hinders it from increasing so fast as it\nwould otherwise increase, and, consequently, from maintaining a still\ngreater quantity of productive labour.\nThe natural good effects of the colony trade, however, more than\ncounterbalance to Great Britain the bad effects of the monopoly; so that,\nmonopoly and altogether, that trade, even as it is carried on at present,\nis not only advantageous, but greatly advantageous. The new market and the\nnew employment which are opened by the colony trade, are of much greater\nextent than that portion of the old market and of the old employment which\nis lost by the monopoly. The new produce and the new capital which has\nbeen created, if one may say so, by the colony trade, maintain in Great\nBritain a greater quantity of productive labour than what can have been\nthrown out of employment by the revulsion of capital from other trades of\nwhich the returns are more frequent. If the colony trade, however, even as\nit is carried on at present, is advantageous to Great Britain, it is not\nby means of the monopoly, but in spite of the monopoly.\nIt is rather for the manufactured than for the rude produce of Europe,\nthat the colony trade opens a new market. Agriculture is the proper\nbusiness of all new colonies; a business which the cheapness of land\nrenders more advantageous than any other. They abound, therefore, in the\nrude produce of land; and instead of importing it from other countries,\nthey have generally a large surplus to export. In new colonies,\nagriculture either draws hands from all other employments, or keeps them\nfrom going to any other employment. There are few hands to spare for the\nnecessary, and none for the ornamental manufactures. The greater part of\nthe manufactures of both kinds they find it cheaper to purchase of other\ncountries than to make for themselves. It is chiefly by encouraging the\nmanufactures of Europe, that the colony trade indirectly encourages its\nagriculture. The manufacturers of Europe, to whom that trade gives\nemployment, constitute a new market for the produce of the land, and the\nmost advantageous of all markets; the home market for the corn and cattle,\nfor the bread and butcher\u2019s meat of Europe, is thus greatly extended by\nmeans of the trade to America.\nBut that the monopoly of the trade of populous and thriving colonies is\nnot alone sufficient to establish, or even to maintain, manufactures in\nany country, the examples of Spain and Portugal sufficiently demonstrate.\nSpain and Portugal were manufacturing countries before they had any\nconsiderable colonies. Since they had the richest and most fertile in the\nworld, they have both ceased to be so.\nIn Spain and Portugal, the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by\nother causes, have, perhaps, nearly overbalanced the natural good effects\nof the colony trade. These causes seem to be other monopolies of different\nkinds: the degradation of the value of gold and silver below what it is in\nmost other countries; the exclusion from foreign markets by improper taxes\nupon exportation, and the narrowing of the home market, by still more\nimproper taxes upon the transportation of goods from one part of the\ncountry to another; but above all, that irregular and partial\nadministration of justice which often protects the rich and powerful\ndebtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the\nindustrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for the consumption\nof those haughty and great men, to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon\ncredit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\nIn England, on the contrary, the natural good effects of the colony trade,\nassisted by other causes, have in a great measure conquered the bad\neffects of the monopoly. These causes seem to be, the general liberty of\ntrade, which, notwithstanding some restraints, is at least equal, perhaps\nsuperior, to what it is in any other country; the liberty of exporting,\nduty free, almost all sorts of goods which are the produce of domestic\nindustry, to almost any foreign country; and what, perhaps, is of still\ngreater importance, the unbounded liberty of transporting them from one\npart of our own country to any other, without being obliged to give any\naccount to any public office, without being liable to question or\nexamination of any kind; but, above all, that equal and impartial\nadministration of justice, which renders the rights of the meanest British\nsubject respectable to the greatest, and which, by securing to every man\nthe fruits of his own industry, gives the greatest and most effectual\nencouragement to every sort of industry.\nIf the manufactures of Great Britain, however, have been advanced, as they\ncertainly have, by the colony trade, it has not been by means of the\nmonopoly of that trade, but in spite of the monopoly. The effect of the\nmonopoly has been, not to augment the quantity, but to alter the quality\nand shape of a part of the manufactures of Great Britain, and to\naccommodate to a market, from which the returns are slow and distant, what\nwould otherwise have been accommodated to one from which the returns are\nfrequent and near. Its effect has consequently been, to turn a part of the\ncapital of Great Britain from an employment in which it would have\nmaintained a greater quantity of manufacturing industry, to one in which\nit maintains a much smaller, and thereby to diminish, instead of\nincreasing, the whole quantity of manufacturing industry maintained in\nGreat Britain.\nThe monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, like all the other mean and\nmalignant expedients of the mercantile system, depresses the industry of\nall other countries, but chiefly that of the colonies, without in the\nleast increasing, but on the contrary diminishing, that of the country in\nwhose favour it is established.\nThe monopoly hinders the capital of that country, whatever may, at any\nparticular time, be the extent of that capital, from maintaining so great\na quantity of productive labour as it would otherwise maintain, and from\naffording so great a revenue to the industrious inhabitants as it would\notherwise afford. But as capital can be increased only by savings from\nrevenue, the monopoly, by hindering it from affording so great a revenue\nas it would otherwise afford, necessarily hinders it from increasing so\nfast as it would otherwise increase, and consequently from maintaining a\nstill greater quantity of productive labour, and affording a still greater\nrevenue to the industrious inhabitants of that country. One great original\nsource of revenue, therefore, the wages of labour, the monopoly must\nnecessarily have rendered, at all times, less abundant than it otherwise\nwould have been.\nBy raising the rate of mercantile profit, the monopoly discourages the\nimprovement of land. The profit of improvement depends upon the difference\nbetween what the land actually produces, and what, by the application of a\ncertain capital, it can be made to produce. If this difference affords a\ngreater profit than what can be drawn from an equal capital in any\nmercantile employment, the improvement of land will draw capital from all\nmercantile employments. If the profit is less, mercantile employments will\ndraw capital from the improvement of land. Whatever, therefore, raises the\nrate of mercantile profit, either lessens the superiority, or increases\nthe inferiority of the profit of improvement: and, in the one case,\nhinders capital from going to improvement, and in the other draws capital\nfrom it; but by discouraging improvement, the monopoly necessarily retards\nthe natural increase of another great original source of revenue, the rent\nof land. By raising the rate of profit, too, the monopoly necessarily\nkeeps up the market rate of interest higher than it otherwise would be.\nBut the price of land, in proportion to the rent which it affords, the\nnumber of years purchase which is commonly paid for it, necessarily falls\nas the rate of interest rises, and rises as the rate of interest falls.\nThe monopoly, therefore, hurts the interest of the landlord two different\nways, by retarding the natural increase, first, of his rent, and,\nsecondly, of the price which he would get for his land, in proportion to\nthe rent which it affords.\nThe monopoly, indeed, raises the rate of mercantile profit and thereby\naugments somewhat the gain of our merchants. But as it obstructs the\nnatural increase of capital, it tends rather to diminish than to increase\nthe sum total of the revenue which the inhabitants of the country derive\nfrom the profits of stock; a small profit upon a great capital generally\naffording a greater revenue than a great profit upon a small one. The\nmonopoly raises the rate of profit, but it hinders the sum of profit from\nrising so high as it otherwise would do.\nAll the original sources of revenue, the wages of labour, the rent of\nland, and the profits of stock, the monopoly renders much less abundant\nthan they otherwise would be. To promote the little interest of one little\norder of men in one country, it hurts the interest of all other orders of\nmen in that country, and of all the men in all other countries.\nIt is solely by raising the ordinary rate of profit, that the monopoly\neither has proved, or could prove, advantageous to any one particular\norder of men. But besides all the bad effects to the country in general,\nwhich have already been mentioned as necessarily resulting from a higher\nrate of profit, there is one more fatal, perhaps, than all these put\ntogether, but which, if we may judge from experience, is inseparably\nconnected with it. The high rate of profit seems everywhere to destroy\nthat parsimony which, in other circumstances, is natural to the character\nof the merchant. When profits are high, that sober virtue seems to be\nsuperfluous, and expensive luxury to suit better the affluence of his\nsituation. But the owners of the great mercantile capitals are necessarily\nthe leaders and conductors of the whole industry of every nation; and\ntheir example has a much greater influence upon the manners of the whole\nindustrious part of it than that of any other order of men. If his\nemployer is attentive and parsimonious, the workman is very likely to be\nso too; but if the master is dissolute and disorderly, the servant, who\nshapes his work according to the pattern which his master prescribes to\nhim, will shape his life, too, according to the example which he sets him.\nAccumulation is thus prevented in the hands of all those who are naturally\nthe most disposed to accumulate; and the funds destined for the\nmaintenance of productive labour, receive no augmentation from the revenue\nof those who ought naturally to augment them the most. The capital of the\ncountry, instead of increasing, gradually dwindles away, and the quantity\nof productive labour maintained in it grows every day less and less. Have\nthe exorbitant profits of the merchants of Cadiz and Lisbon augmented the\ncapital of Spain and Portugal? Have they alleviated the poverty, have they\npromoted the industry, of those two beggarly countries? Such has been the\ntone of mercantile expense in those two trading cities, that those\nexorbitant profits, far from augmenting the general capital of the\ncountry, seem scarce to have been sufficient to keep up the capitals upon\nwhich they were made. Foreign capitals are every day intruding themselves,\nif I may say so, more and more into the trade of Cadiz and Lisbon. It is\nto expel those foreign capitals from a trade which their own grows every\nday more and more insufficient for carrying on, that the Spaniards and\nPortuguese endeavour every day to straiten more and more the galling bands\nof their absurd monopoly. Compare the mercantile manners of Cadiz and\nLisbon with those of Amsterdam, and you will be sensible how differently\nthe conduct and character of merchants are affected by the high and by the\nlow profits of stock. The merchants of London, indeed, have not yet\ngenerally become such magnificent lords as those of Cadiz and Lisbon; but\nneither are they in general such attetitive and parsimonious burghers as\nthose of Amsterdam. They are supposed, however, many of them, to be a good\ndeal richer than the greater part of the former, and not quire so rich as\nmany of the latter: but the rate of their profit is commonly much lower\nthan that of the former, and a good deal higher than that of the latter.\nLight come, light go, says the proverb; and the ordinary tone of expense\nseems everywhere to be regulated, not so much according to the real\nability of spending, as to the supposed facility of getting money to\nspend.\nIt is thus that the single advantage which the monopoly procures to a\nsingle order of men, is in many different ways hurtful to the general\ninterest of the country.\nTo found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of\ncustomers, may at first sight, appear a project fit only for a nation of\nshopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of\nshopkeepers, but extremely fit for a nation whose government is influenced\nby shopkeepers. Such statesmen, and such statesmen only, are capable of\nfancying that they will find some advantage in employing the blood and\ntreasure of their fellow-citizens, to found and maintain such an empire.\nSay to a shopkeeper, Buy me a good estate, and I shall always buy my\nclothes at your shop, even though I should pay somewhat dearer than what I\ncan have them for at other shops; and you will not find him very forward\nto embrace your proposal. But should any other person buy you such an\nestate, the shopkeeper will be much obliged to your benefactor if he would\nenjoin you to buy all your clothes at his shop. England purchased for some\nof her subjects, who found themselves uneasy at home, a great estate in a\ndistant country. The price, indeed, was very small, and instead of thirty\nyears purchase, the ordinary price of land in the present times, it\namounted to little more than the expense of the different equipments which\nmade the first discovery, reconnoitered the coast, and took a fictitious\npossession of the country. The land was good, and of great extent; and the\ncultivators having plenty of good ground to work upon, and being for some\ntime at liberty to sell their produce where they pleased, became, in the\ncourse of little more than thirty or forty years (between 1620 and 1660),\nso numerous and thriving a people, that the shopkeepers and other traders\nof England wished to secure to themselves the monopoly of their custom.\nWithout pretending, therefore, that they had paid any part, either of the\noriginal purchase money, or of the subsequent expense of improvement, they\npetitioned the parliament, that the cultivators of America might for the\nfuture be confined to their shop; first, for buying all the goods which\nthey wanted from Europe; and, secondly, for selling all such parts of\ntheir own produce as those traders might find it convenient to buy. For\nthey did not find it convenient to buy every part of it. Some parts of it\nimported into England, might have interfered with some of the trades which\nthey themselves carried on at home. Those particular parts of it,\ntherefore, they were willing that the colonists should sell where they\ncould; the farther off the better; and upon that account proposed that\ntheir market should be confined to the countries south of Cape Finisterre.\nA clause in the famous act of navigation established this truly shopkeeper\nproposal into a law.\nThe maintenance of this monopoly has hitherto been the principal, or more\nproperly, perhaps, the sole end and purpose of the dominion which Great\nBritain assumes over her colonies. In the exclusive trade, it is supposed,\nconsists the great advantage of provinces, which have never yet afforded\neither revenue or military force for the support of the civil government,\nor the defence of the mother country. The monopoly is the principal badge\nof their dependency, and it is the sole fruit which has hitherto been\ngathered from that dependency. Whatever expense Great Britain has hitherto\nlaid out in maintaining this dependency, has really been laid out in order\nto support this monopoly. The expense of the ordinary peace establishment\nof the colonies amounted, before the commencement of the present\ndisturbances to the pay of twenty regiments of foot; to the expense of the\nartillery, stores, and extraordinary provisions, with which it was\nnecessary to supply them; and to the expense of a very considerable naval\nforce, which was constantly kept up, in order to guard from the smuggling\nvessels of other nations, the immense coast of North America, and that of\nour West Indian islands. The whole expense of this peace establishment was\na charge upon the revenue of Great Britain, and was, at the same time, the\nsmallest part of what the dominion of the colonies has cost the mother\ncountry. If we would know the amount of the whole, we must add to the\nannual expense of this peace establishment, the interest of the sums\nwhich, in consequence of their considering her colonies as provinces\nsubject to her dominion, Great Britain has, upon different occasions, laid\nout upon their defence. We must add to it, in particular, the whole\nexpense of the late war, and a great part of that of the war which\npreceded it. The late war was altogether a colony quarrel; and the whole\nexpense of it, in whatever part of the world it might have been laid out,\nwhether in Germany or the East Indies, ought justly to be stated to the\naccount of the colonies. It amounted to more than ninety millions\nsterling, including not only the new debt which was contracted, but the\ntwo shillings in the pound additional land tax, and the sums which were\nevery year borrowed from the sinking fund. The Spanish war which began in\n1739 was principally a colony quarrel. Its principal object was to prevent\nthe search of the colony ships, which carried on a contraband trade with\nthe Spanish Main. This whole expense is, in reality, a bounty which has\nbeen given in order to support a monopoly. The pretended purpose of it was\nto encourage the manufactures, and to increase the commerce of Great\nBritain. But its real effect has been to raise the rate of mercantile\nprofit, and to enable our merchants to turn into a branch of trade, of\nwhich the returns are more slow and distant than those of the greater part\nof other trades, a greater proportion of their capital than they otherwise\nwould have done; two events which, if a bounty could have prevented, it\nmight perhaps have been very well worth while to give such a bounty.\nUnder the present system of management, therefore, Great Britain derives\nnothing but loss from the dominion which she assumes over her colonies.\nTo propose that Great Britain should voluntarily give up all authority\nover her colonies, and leave them to elect their own magistrates, to enact\ntheir own laws, and to make peace and war, as they might think proper,\nwould be to propose such a measure as never was, and never will be,\nadopted by any nation in the world. No nation ever voluntarily gave up the\ndominion of any province, how troublesome soever it might be to govern it,\nand how small soever the revenue which it afforded might be in proportion\nto the expense which it occasioned. Such sacrifices, though they might\nfrequently be agreeable to the interest, are always mortifying to the\npride of every nation; and, what is perhaps of still greater consequence,\nthey are always contrary to the private interest of the governing part of\nit, who would thereby be deprived of the disposal of many places of trust\nand profit, of many opportunities of acquiring wealth and distinction,\nwhich the possession of the most turbulent, and, to the great body of the\npeople, the most unprofitable province, seldom fails to afford. The most\nvisionary enthusiasts would scarce be capable of proposing such a measure,\nwith any serious hopes at least of its ever being adopted. If it was\nadopted, however, Great Britain would not only be immediately freed from\nthe whole annual expense of the peace establishment of the colonies, but\nmight settle with them such a treaty of commerce as would effectually\nsecure to her a free trade, more advantageous to the great body of the\npeople, though less so to the merchants, than the monopoly which she at\npresent enjoys. By thus parting good friends, the natural affection of the\ncolonies to the mother country, which, perhaps, our late dissensions have\nwell nigh extinguished, would quickly revive. It might dispose them not\nonly to respect, for whole centuries together, that treaty of commerce\nwhich they had concluded with us at parting, but to favour us in war as\nwell as in trade, and instead of turbulent and factious subjects, to\nbecome our most faithful, affectionate, and generous allies; and the same\nsort of parental affection on the one side, and filial respect on the\nother, might revive between Great Britain and her colonies, which used to\nsubsist between those of ancient Greece and the mother city from which\nthey descended.\nIn order to render any province advantageous to the empire to which it\nbelongs, it ought to afford, in time of peace, a revenue to the public,\nsufficient not only for defraying the whole expense of its own peace\nestablishment, but for contributing its proportion to the support of the\ngeneral government of the empire. Every province necessarily contributes,\nmore or less, to increase the expense of that general government. If any\nparticular province, therefore, does not contribute its share towards\ndefraying this expense, an unequal burden must be thrown upon some other\npart of the empire. The extraordinary revenue, too, which every province\naffords to the public in time of war, ought, from parity of reason, to\nbear the same proportion to the extraordinary revenue of the whole empire,\nwhich its ordinary revenue does in time of peace. That neither the\nordinary nor extraordinary revenue which Great Britain derives from her\ncolonies, bears this proportion to the whole revenue of the British\nempire, will readily be allowed. The monopoly, it has been supposed,\nindeed, by increasing the private revenue of the people of Great Britain,\nand thereby enabling them to pay greater taxes, compensates the deficiency\nof the public revenue of the colonies. But this monopoly, I have\nendeavoured to show, though a very grievous tax upon the colonies, and\nthough it may increase the revenue of a particular order of men in Great\nBritain, diminishes, instead of increasing, that of the great body of the\npeople, and consequently diminishes, instead of increasing, the ability of\nthe great body of the people to pay taxes. The men, too, whose revenue the\nmonopoly increases, constitute a particular order, which it is both\nabsolutely impossible to tax beyond the proportion of other orders, and\nextremely impolitic even to attempt to tax beyond that proportion, as I\nshall endeavour to show in the following book. No particular resource,\ntherefore, can be drawn from this particular order.\nThe colonies may be taxed either by their own assemblies, or by the\nparliament of Great Britain.\nThat the colony assemblies can never be so managed as to levy upon their\nconstituents a public revenue, sufficient, not only to maintain at all\ntimes their own civil and military establishment, but to pay their proper\nproportion of the expense of the general government of the British empire,\nseems not very probable. It was a long time before even the parliament of\nEngland, though placed immediately under the eye of the sovereign, could\nbe brought under such a system of management, or could be rendered\nsufficiently liberal in their grants for supporting the civil and military\nestablishments even of their own country. It was only by distributing\namong the particular members of parliament a great part either of the\noffices, or of the disposal of the offices arising from this civil and\nmilitary establishment, that such a system of management could be\nestablished, even with regard to the parliament of England. But the\ndistance of the colony assemblies from the eye of the sovereign, their\nnumber, their dispersed situation, and their various constitutions, would\nrender it very difficult to manage them in the same manner, even though\nthe sovereign had the same means of doing it; and those means are wanting.\nIt would be absolutely impossible to distribute among all the leading\nmembers of all the colony assemblies such a share, either of the offices,\nor of the disposal of the offices, arising from the general government of\nthe British empire, as to dispose them to give up their popularity at\nhome, and to tax their constituents for the support of that general\ngovernment, of which almost the whole emoluments were to be divided among\npeople who were strangers to them. The unavoidable ignorance of\nadministration, besides, concerning the relative importance of the\ndifferent members of those different assemblies, the offences which must\nfrequently be given, the blunders which must constantly be committed, in\nattempting to manage them in this manner, seems to render such a system of\nmanagement altogether impracticable with regard to them.\nThe colony assemblies, besides, cannot be supposed the proper judges of\nwhat is necessary for the defence and support of the whole empire. The\ncare of that defence and support is not entrusted to them. It is not their\nbusiness, and they have no regular means of information concerning it. The\nassembly of a province, like the vestry of a parish, may judge very\nproperly concerning the affairs of its own particular district, but can\nhave no proper means of judging concerning those of the whole empire. It\ncannot even judge properly concerning the proportion which its own\nprovince bears to the whole empire, or concerning the relative degree of\nits wealth and importance, compared with the other provinces; because\nthose other provinces are not under the inspection and superintendency of\nthe assembly of a particular province. What is necessary for the defence\nand support of the whole empire, and in what proportion each part ought to\ncontribute, can be judged of only by that assembly which inspects and\nsuper-intends the affairs of the whole empire.\nIt has been proposed, accordingly, that the colonies should be taxed by\nrequisition, the parliament of Great Britain determining the sum which\neach colony ought to pay, and the provincial assembly assessing and\nlevying it in the way that suited best the circumstances of the province.\nWhat concerned the whole empire would in this way be determined by the\nassembly which inspects and superintends the affairs of the whole empire;\nand the provincial affairs of each colony might still be regulated by its\nown assembly. Though the colonies should, in this case, have no\nrepresentatives in the British parliament, yet, if we may judge by\nexperience, there is no probability that the parliamentary requisition\nwould be unreasonable. The parliament of England has not, upon any\noccasion, shewn the smallest disposition to overburden those parts of the\nempire which are not represented in parliament. The islands of Guernsey\nand Jersey, without any means of resisting the authority of parliament,\nare more lightly taxed than any part of Great Britain. Parliament, in\nattempting to exercise its supposed right, whether well or ill grounded,\nof taxing the colonies, has never hitherto demanded of them anything which\neven approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their fellow\nsubjects at home. If the contribution of the colonies, besides, was to\nrise or fall in proportion to the rise or fall of the land-tax, parliament\ncould not tax them without taxing, at the same time, its own constituents,\nand the colonies might, in this case, be considered as virtually\nrepresented in parliament.\nExamples are not wanting of empires in which all the different provinces\nare not taxed, if I may be allowed the expression, in one mass; but in\nwhich the sovereign regulates the sum which each province ought to pay,\nand in some provinces assesses and levies it as he thinks proper; while in\nothers he leaves it to be assessed and levied as the respective states of\neach province shall determine. In some provinces of France, the king not\nonly imposes what taxes he thinks proper, but assesses and levies them in\nthe way he thinks proper. From others he demands a certain sum, but leaves\nit to the states of each province to assess and levy that sum as they\nthink proper. According to the scheme of taxing by requisition, the\nparliament of Great Britain would stand nearly in the same situation\ntowards the colony assemblies, as the king of France does towards the\nstates of those provinces which still enjoy the privilege of having states\nof their own, the provinces of France which are supposed to be the best\ngoverned.\nBut though, according to this scheme, the colonies could have no just\nreason to fear that their share of the public burdens should ever exceed\nthe proper proportion to that of their fellow-citizens at home, Great\nBritain might have just reason to fear that it never would amount to that\nproper proportion. The parliament of Great Britain has not, for some time\npast, had the same established authority in the colonies, which the French\nking has in those provinces of France which still enjoy the privilege of\nhaving states of their own. The colony assemblies, if they were not very\nfavourably disposed (and unless more skilfully managed than they ever have\nbeen hitherto, they are not very likely to be so), might still find many\npretences for evading or rejecting the most reasonable requisitions of\nparliament. A French war breaks out, we shall suppose; ten millions must\nimmediately be raised, in order to defend the seat of the empire. This sum\nmust be borrowed upon the credit of some parliamentary fund mortgaged for\npaying the interest. Part of this fund parliament proposes to raise by a\ntax to be levied in Great Britain; and part of it by a requisition to all\nthe different colony assemblies of America and the West Indies. Would\npeople readily advance their money upon the credit of a fund which partly\ndepended upon the good humour of all those assemblies, far distant from\nthe seat of the war, and sometimes, perhaps, thinking themselves not much\nconcerned in the event of it? Upon such a fund, no more money would\nprobably be advanced than what the tax to be levied in Great Britain might\nbe supposed to answer for. The whole burden of the debt contracted on\naccount of the war would in this manner fall, as it always has done\nhitherto, upon Great Britain; upon a part of the empire, and not upon the\nwhole empire. Great Britain is, perhaps, since the world began, the only\nstate which, as it has extended its empire, has only increased its\nexpense, without once augmenting its resources. Other states have\ngenerally disburdened themselves, upon their subject and subordinate\nprovinces, of the most considerable part of the expense of defending the\nempire. Great Britain has hitherto suffered her subject and subordinate\nprovinces to disburden themselves upon her of almost this whole expense.\nIn order to put Great Britain upon a footing of equality with her own\ncolonies, which the law has hitherto supposed to be subject and\nsubordinate, it seems necessary, upon the scheme of taxing them by\nparliamentary requisition, that parliament should have some means of\nrendering its requisitions immediately effectual, in case the colony\nassemblies should attempt to evade or reject them; and what those means\nare, it is not very easy to conceive, and it has not yet been explained.\nShould the parliament of Great Britain, at the same time, be ever fully\nestablished in the right of taxing the colonies, even independent of the\nconsent of their own assemblies, the importance of those assemblies would,\nfrom that moment, be at an end, and with it, that of all the leading men\nof British America. Men desire to have some share in the management of\npublic affairs, chiefly on account of the importance which it gives them.\nUpon the power which the greater part of the leading men, the natural\naristocracy of every country, have of preserving or defending their\nrespective importance, depends the stability and duration of every system\nof free government. In the attacks which those leading men are continually\nmaking upon the importance of one another, and in the defence of their\nown, consists the whole play of domestic faction and ambition. The leading\nmen of America, like those of all other countries, desire to preserve\ntheir own importance. They feel, or imagine, that if their assemblies,\nwhich they are fond of calling parliaments, and of considering as equal in\nauthority to the parliament of Great Britain, should be so far degraded as\nto become the humble ministers and executive officers of that parliament,\nthe greater part of their own importance would be at an end. They have\nrejected, therefore, the proposal of being taxed by parliamentary\nrequisition, and, like other ambitious and high-spirited men, have rather\nchosen to draw the sword in defence of their own importance.\nTowards the declension of the Roman republic, the allies of Rome, who had\nborne the principal burden of defending the state and extending the\nempire, demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens.\nUpon being refused, the social war broke out. During the course of that\nwar, Rome granted those privileges to the greater part of them, one by\none, and in proportion as they detached themselves from the general\nconfederacy. The parliament of Great Britain insists upon taxing the\ncolonies; and they refuse to be taxed by a parliament in which they are\nnot represented. If to each colony which should detach itself from the\ngeneral confederacy, Great Britain should allow such a number of\nrepresentatives as suited the proportion of what it contributed to the\npublic revenue of the empire, in consequence of its being subjected to the\nsame taxes, and in compensation admitted to the same freedom of trade with\nits fellow-subjects at home; the number of its representatives to be\naugmented as the proportion of its contribution might afterwards augment;\na new method of acquiring importance, a new and more dazzling object of\nambition, would be presented to the leading men of each colony. Instead of\npiddling for the little prizes which are to be found in what may be called\nthe paltry raffle of colony faction, they might then hope, from the\npresumption which men naturally have in their own ability and good\nfortune, to draw some of the great prizes which sometimes come from the\nwheel of the great state lottery of British politics. Unless this or some\nother method is fallen upon, and there seems to be none more obvious than\nthis, of preserving the importance and of gratifying the ambition of the\nleading men of America, it is not very probable that they will ever\nvoluntarily submit to us; and we ought to consider, that the blood which\nmust be shed in forcing them to do so, is, every drop of it, the blood\neither of those who are, or of those whom we wish to have for our fellow\ncitizens. They are very weak who flatter themselves that, in the state to\nwhich things have come, our colonies will be easily conquered by force\nalone. The persons who now govern the resolutions of what they call their\ncontinental congress, feel in themselves at this moment a degree of\nimportance which, perhaps, the greatest subjects in Europe scarce feel.\nFrom shopkeepers, trades men, and attorneys, they are become statesmen and\nlegislators, and are employed in contriving a new form of government for\nan extensive empire, which, they flatter themselves, will become, and\nwhich, indeed, seems very likely to become, one of the greatest and most\nformidable that ever was in the world. Five hundred different people,\nperhaps, who, in different ways, act immediately under the continental\ncongress, and five hundred thousand, perhaps, who act under those five\nhundred, all feel, in the same manner, a proportionable rise in their own\nimportance. Almost every individual of the governing party in America\nfills, at present, in his own fancy, a station superior, not only to what\nhe had ever filled before, but to what he had ever expected to fill; and\nunless some new object of ambition is presented either to him or to his\nleaders, if he has the ordinary spirit of a man, he will die in defence of\nthat station.\nIt is a remark of the President Heynaut, that we now read with pleasure\nthe account of many little transactions of the Ligue, which, when they\nhappened, were not, perhaps, considered as very important pieces of news.\nBut everyman then, says he, fancied himself of some importance; and the\ninnumerable memoirs which have come down to us from those times, were the\ngreater part of them written by people who took pleasure in recording and\nmagnifying events, in which they flattered themselves they had been\nconsiderable actors. How obstinately the city of Paris, upon that\noccasion, defended itself, what a dreadful famine it supported, rather\nthan submit to the best, and afterwards the most beloved of all the French\nkings, is well known. The greater part of the citizens, or those who\ngoverned the greater part of them, fought in defence of their own\nimportance, which, they foresaw, was to be at an end whenever the ancient\ngovernment should be re-established. Our colonies, unless they can be\ninduced to consent to a union, are very likely to defend themselves,\nagainst the best of all mother countries, as obstinately as the city of\nParis did against one of the best of kings.\nThe idea of representation was unknown in ancient times. When the people\nof one state were admitted to the right of citizenship in another, they\nhad no other means of exercising that right, but by coming in a body to\nvote and deliberate with the people of that other state. The admission of\nthe greater part of the inhabitants of Italy to the privileges of Roman\ncitizens, completely ruined the Roman republic. It was no longer possible\nto distinguish between who was, and who was not, a Roman citizen. No tribe\ncould know its own members. A rabble of any kind could be introduced into\nthe assemblies of the people, could drive out the real citizens, and\ndecide upon the affairs of the republic, as if they themselves had been\nsuch. But though America were to send fifty or sixty new representatives\nto parliament, the door-keeper of the house of commons could not find any\ngreat difficulty in distinguishing between who was and who was not a\nmember. Though the Roman constitution, therefore, was necessarily ruined\nby the union of Rome with the allied states of Italy, there is not the\nleast probability that the British constitution would be hurt by the union\nof Great Britain with her colonies. That constitution, on the contrary,\nwould be completed by it, and seems to be imperfect without it. The\nassembly which deliberates and decides concerning the affairs of every\npart of the empire, in order to be properly informed, ought certainly to\nhave representatives from every part of it. That this union, however,\ncould be easily effectuated, or that difficulties, and great difficulties,\nmight not occur in the execution, I do not pretend. I have yet heard of\nnone, however, which appear insurmountable. The principal, perhaps, arise,\nnot from the nature of things, but from the prejudices and opinions of the\npeople, both on this and on the other side of the Atlantic.\nWe on this side the water are afraid lest the multitude of American\nrepresentatives should overturn the balance of the constitution, and\nincrease too much either the influence of the crown on the one hand, or\nthe force of the democracy on the other. But if the number of American\nrepresentatives were to be in proportion to the produce of American\ntaxation, the number of people to be managed would increase exactly in\nproportion to the means of managing them, and the means of managing to the\nnumber of people to be managed. The monarchical and democratical parts of\nthe constitution would, after the union, stand exactly in the same degree\nof relative force with regard to one another as they had done before.\nThe people on the other side of the water are afraid lest their distance\nfrom the seat of government might expose them to many oppressions; but\ntheir representatives in parliament, of which the number ought from the\nfirst to be considerable, would easily be able to protect them from all\noppression. The distance could not much weaken the dependency of the\nrepresentative upon the constituent, and the former would still feel that\nhe owed his seat in parliament, and all the consequence which he derived\nfrom it, to the good-will of the latter. It would be the interest of the\nformer, therefore, to cultivate that good-will, by complaining, with all\nthe authority of a member of the legislature, of every outrage which any\ncivil or military officer might be guilty of in those remote parts of the\nempire. The distance of America from the seat of government, besides, the\nnatives of that country might flatter themselves, with some appearance of\nreason too, would not be of very long continuance. Such has hitherto been\nthe rapid progress of that country in wealth, population, and improvement,\nthat in the course of little more than a century, perhaps, the produce of\nthe American might exceed that of the British taxation. The seat of the\nempire would then naturally remove itself to that part of the empire which\ncontributed most to the general defence and support of the whole.\nThe discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by the\nCape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events recorded\nin the history of mankind. Their consequences have already been great;\nbut, in the short period of between two and three centuries which has\nelapsed since these discoveries were made, it is impossible that the whole\nextent of their consequences can have been seen. What benefits or what\nmisfortunes to mankind may hereafter result from those great events, no\nhuman wisdom can foresee. By uniting in some measure the most distant\nparts of the world, by enabling them to relieve one another\u2019s wants, to\nincrease one another\u2019s enjoyments, and to encourage one another\u2019s\nindustry, their general tendency would seem to be beneficial. To the\nnatives, however, both of the East and West Indies, all the commercial\nbenefits which can have resulted from those events have been sunk and lost\nin the dreadful misfortunes which they have occasioned. These misfortunes,\nhowever, seem to have arisen rather from accident than from any thing in\nthe nature of those events themselves. At the particular time when these\ndiscoveries were made, the superiority of force happened to be so great on\nthe side of the Europeans, that they were enabled to commit with impunity\nevery sort of injustice in those remote countries. Hereafter, perhaps, the\nnatives of those countries may grow stronger, or those of Europe may grow\nweaker; and the inhabitants of all the different quarters of the world may\narrive at that equality of courage and force which, by inspiring mutual\nfear, can alone overawe the injustice of independent nations into some\nsort of respect for the rights of one another. But nothing seems more\nlikely to establish this equality of force, than that mutual communication\nof knowledge, and of all sorts of improvements, which an extensive\ncommerce from all countries to all countries naturally, or rather\nnecessarily, carries along with it.\nIn the mean time, one of the principal effects of those discoveries has\nbeen, to raise the mercantile system to a degree of splendour and glory\nwhich it could never otherwise have attained to. It is the object of that\nsystem to enrich a great nation, rather by trade and manufactures than by\nthe improvement and cultivation of land, rather by the industry of the\ntowns than by that of the country. But in consequence of those\ndiscoveries, the commercial towns of Europe, instead of being the\nmanufacturers and carriers for but a very small part of the world (that\npart of Europe which is washed by the Atlantic ocean, and the countries\nwhich lie round the Baltic and Mediterranean seas), have now become the\nmanufacturers for the numerous and thriving cultivators of America, and\nthe carriers, and in some respects the manufacturers too, for almost all\nthe different nations of Asia, Africa, and America. Two new worlds have\nbeen opened to their industry, each of them much greater and more\nextensive than the old one, and the market of one of them growing still\ngreater and greater every day.\nThe countries which possess the colonies of America, and which trade\ndirectly to the East Indies, enjoy indeed the whole show and splendour of\nthis great commerce. Other countries, however, notwithstanding all the\ninvidious restraints by which it is meant to exclude them, frequently\nenjoy a greater share of the real benefit of it. The colonies of Spain and\nPortugal, for example, give more real encouragement to the industry of\nother countries than to that of Spain and Portugal. In the single article\nof linen alone, the consumption of those colonies amounts, it is said (but\nI do not pretend to warrant the quantity ), to more than three millions\nsterling a-year. But this great consumption is almost entirely supplied by\nFrance, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. Spain and Portugal furnish but a\nsmall part of it. The capital which supplies the colonies with this great\nquantity of linen, is annually distributed among, and furnishes a revenue\nto, the inhabitants of those other countries. The profits of it only are\nspent in Spain and Portugal, where they help to support the sumptuous\nprofusion of the merchants of Cadiz and Lisbon.\nEven the regulations by which each nation endeavours to secure to itself\nthe exclusive trade of its own colonies, are frequently more hurtful to\nthe countries in favour of which they are established, than to those\nagainst which they are established. The unjust oppression of the industry\nof other countries falls back, if I may say so, upon the heads of the\noppressors, and crushes their industry more than it does that of those\nother countries. By those regulations, for example, the merchant of\nHamburg must send the linen which he destines for the American market to\nLondon, and he must bring back from thence the tobacco which he destines\nfor the German market; because he can neither send the one directly to\nAmerica, nor bring the other directly from thence. By this restraint he is\nprobably obliged to sell the one somewhat cheaper, and to buy the other\nsomewhat dearer, than he otherwise might have done; and his profits are\nprobably somewhat abridged by means of it. In this trade, however, between\nHamburg and London, he certainly receives the returns of his capital much\nmore quickly than he could possibly have done in the direct trade to\nAmerica, even though we should suppose, what is by no means the case, that\nthe payments of America were as punctual as those of London. In the trade,\ntherefore, to which those regulations confine the merchant of Hamburg, his\ncapital can keep in constant employment a much greater quantity of German\nindustry than he possibly could have done in the trade from which he is\nexcluded. Though the one employment, therefore, may to him perhaps be less\nprofitable than the other, it cannot be less advantageous to his country.\nIt is quite otherwise with the employment into which the monopoly\nnaturally attracts, if I may say so, the capital of the London merchant.\nThat employment may, perhaps, be more profitable to him than the greater\npart of other employments; but on account of the slowness of the returns,\nit cannot be more advantageous to his country.\nAfter all the unjust attempts, therefore, of every country in Europe to\nengross to itself the whole advantage of the trade of its own colonies, no\ncountry has yet been able to engross to itself any thing but the expense\nof supporting in time of peace, and of defending in time of war, the\noppressive authority which it assumes over them. The inconveniencies\nresulting from the possession of its colonies, every country has engrossed\nto itself completely. The advantages resulting from their trade, it has\nbeen obliged to share with many other countries.\nAt first sight, no doubt, the monopoly of the great commerce of America\nnaturally seems to be an acquisition of the highest value. To the\nundiscerning eye of giddy ambition it naturally presents itself, amidst\nthe confused scramble of politics and war, as a very dazzling object to\nfight for. The dazzling splendour of the object, however, the immense\ngreatness of the commerce, is the very quality which renders the monopoly\nof it hurtful, or which makes one employment, in its own nature\nnecessarily less advantageous to the country than the greater part of\nother employments, absorb a much greater proportion of the capital of the\ncountry than what would otherwise have gone to it.\nThe mercantile stock of every country, it has been shown in the second\nbook, naturally seeks, if one may say so, the employment most advantageous\nto that country. If it is employed in the carrying trade, the country to\nwhich it belongs becomes the emporium of the goods of all the countries\nwhose trade that stock carries on. But the owner of that stock necessarily\nwishes to dispose of as great a part of those goods as he can at home. He\nthereby saves himself the trouble, risk, and expense of exportation; and\nhe will upon that account be glad to sell them at home, not only for a\nmuch smaller price, but with somewhat a smaller profit, than he might\nexpect to make by sending them abroad. He naturally, therefore, endeavours\nas much as he can to turn his carrying trade into a foreign trade of\nconsumption, If his stock, again, is employed in a foreign trade of\nconsumption, he will, for the same reason, be glad to dispose of, at home,\nas great a part as he can of the home goods which he collects in order to\nexport to some foreign market, and he will thus endeavour, as much as he\ncan, to turn his foreign trade of consumption into a home trade. The\nmercantile stock of every country naturally courts in this manner the\nnear, and shuns the distant employment: naturally courts the employment in\nwhich the returns are frequent, and shuns that in which they are distant\nand slow; naturally courts the employment in which it can maintain the\ngreatest quantity of productive labour in the country to which it belongs,\nor in which its owner resides, and shuns that in which it can maintain\nthere the smallest quantity. It naturally courts the employment which in\nordinary cases is most advantageous, and shuns that which in ordinary\ncases is least advantageous to that country.\nBut if, in any one of those distant employments, which in ordinary cases\nare less advantageous to the country, the profit should happen to rise\nsomewhat higher than what is sufficient to balance the natural preference\nwhich is given to nearer employments, this superiority of profit will draw\nstock from those nearer employments, till the profits of all return to\ntheir proper level. This superiority of profit, however, is a proof that,\nin the actual circumstances of the society, those distant employments are\nsomewhat understocked in proportion to other employments, and that the\nstock of the society is not distributed in the properest manner among all\nthe different employments carried on in it. It is a proof that something\nis either bought cheaper or sold dearer than it ought to be, and that some\nparticular class of citizens is more or less oppressed, either by paying\nmore, or by getting less than what is suitable to that equality which\nought to take place, and which naturally does take place, among all the\ndifferent classes of them. Though the same capital never will maintain the\nsame quantity of productive labour in a distant as in a near employment,\nyet a distant employment maybe as necessary for the welfare of the society\nas a near one; the goods which the distant employment deals in being\nnecessary, perhaps, for carrying on many of the nearer employments. But if\nthe profits of those who deal in such goods are above their proper level,\nthose goods will be sold dearer than they ought to be, or somewhat above\ntheir natural price, and all those engaged in the nearer employments will\nbe more or less oppressed by this high price. Their interest, therefore,\nin this case, requires, that some stock should be withdrawn from those\nnearer employments, and turned towards that distant one, in order to\nreduce its profits to their proper level, and the price of the goods which\nit deals in to their natural price. In this extraordinary case, the public\ninterest requires that some stock should be withdrawn from those\nemployments which, in ordinary cases, are more advantageous, and turned\ntowards one which, in ordinary cases, is less advantageous to the public;\nand, in this extraordinary case, the natural interests and inclinations of\nmen coincide as exactly with the public interests as in all other ordinary\ncases, and lead them to withdraw stock from the near, and to turn it\ntowards the distant employments.\nIt is thus that the private interests and passions of individuals\nnaturally dispose them to turn their stock towards the employments which\nin ordinary cases, are most advantageous to the society. But if from this\nnatural preference they should turn too much of it towards those\nemployments, the fall of profit in them, and the rise of it in all others,\nimmediately dispose them to alter this faulty distribution. Without any\nintervention of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men\nnaturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society\namong all the different employments carried on in it; as nearly as\npossible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the\nwhole society.\nAll the different regulations of the mercantile system necessarily derange\nmore or less this natural and most advantageous distribution of stock. But\nthose which concern the trade to America and the East Indies derange it,\nperhaps, more than any other; because the trade to those two great\ncontinents absorbs a greater quantity of stock than any two other branches\nof trade. The regulations, however, by which this derangement is effected\nin those two different branches of trade, are not altogether the same.\nMonopoly is the great engine of both; but it is a different sort of\nmonopoly. Monopoly of one kind or another, indeed, seems to be the sole\nengine of the mercantile system.\nIn the trade to America, every nation endeavours to engross as much as\npossible the whole market of its own colonies, by fairly excluding all\nother nations from any direct trade to them. During the greater part of\nthe sixteenth century, the Portuguese endeavoured to manage the trade to\nthe East Indies in the same manner, by claiming the sole right of sailing\nin the Indian seas, on account of the merit of having first found out the\nroad to them. The Dutch still continue to exclude all other European\nnations from any direct trade to their spice islands. Monopolies of this\nkind are evidently established against all other European nations, who are\nthereby not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient for\nthem to turn some part of their stock, but are obliged to buy the goods\nwhich that trade deals in, somewhat dearer than if they could import them\nthemselves directly from the countries which produced them.\nBut since the fall of the power of Portugal, no European nation has\nclaimed the exclusive right of sailing in the Indian seas, of which the\nprincipal ports are now open to the ships of all European nations. Except\nin Portugal, however, and within these few years in France, the trade to\nthe East Indies has, in every European country, been subjected to an\nexclusive company. Monopolies of this kind are properly established\nagainst the very nation which erects them. The greater part of that nation\nare thereby not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient\nfor them to turn some part of their stock, but are obliged to buy the\ngoods which that trade deals in somewhat dearer than if it was open and\nfree to all their countrymen. Since the establishment of the English East\nIndia company, for example, the other inhabitants of England, over and\nabove being excluded from the trade, must have paid, in the price of the\nEast India goods which they have consumed, not only for all the\nextraordinary profits which the company may have made upon those goods in\nconsequence of their monopoly, but for all the extraordinary waste which\nthe fraud and abuse inseparable from the management of the affairs of so\ngreat a company must necessarily have occasioned. The absurdity of this\nsecond kind of monopoly, therefore, is much more manifest than that of the\nfirst.\nBoth these kinds of monopolies derange more or less the natural\ndistribution of the stock of the society; but they do not always derange\nit in the same way.\nMonopolies of the first kind always attract to the particular trade in\nwhich they are established a greater proportion of the stock of the\nsociety than what would go to that trade of its own accord.\nMonopolies of the second kind may sometimes attract stock towards the\nparticular trade in which they are established, and sometimes repel it\nfrom that trade, according to different circumstances. In poor countries,\nthey naturally attract towards that trade more stock than would otherwise\ngo to it. In rich countries, they naturally repel from it a good deal of\nstock which would otherwise go to it.\nSuch poor countries as Sweden and Denmark, for example, would probably\nhave never sent a single ship to the East Indies, had not the trade been\nsubjected to an exclusive company. The establishment of such a company\nnecessarily encourages adventurers. Their monopoly secures them against\nall competitors in the home market, and they have the same chance for\nforeign markets with the traders of other nations. Their monopoly shows\nthem the certainty of a great profit upon a considerable quantity of\ngoods, and the chance of a considerable profit upon a great quantity.\nWithout such extraordinary encouragement, the poor traders of such poor\ncountries would probably never have thought of hazarding their small\ncapitals in so very distant and uncertain an adventure as the trade to the\nEast Indies must naturally have appeared to them.\nSuch a rich country as Holland, on the contrary, would probably, in the\ncase of a free trade, send many more ships to the East Indies than it\nactually does. The limited stock of the Dutch East India company probably\nrepels from that trade many great mercantile capitals which would\notherwise go to it. The mercantile capital of Holland is so great, that it\nis, as it were, continually overflowing, sometimes into the public funds\nof foreign countries, sometimes into loans to private traders and\nadventurers of foreign countries, sometimes into the most round-about\nforeign trades of consumption, and sometimes into the carrying trade. All\nnear employments being completely filled up, all the capital which can be\nplaced in them with any tolerable profit being already placed in them, the\ncapital of Holland necessarily flows towards the most distant employments.\nThe trade to the East Indies, if it were altogether free, would probably\nabsorb the greater part of this redundant capital. The East Indies offer a\nmarket both for the manufactures of Europe, and for the gold and silver,\nas well as for the several other productions of America, greater and more\nextensive than both Europe and America put together.\nEvery derangement of the natural distribution of stock is necessarily\nhurtful to the society in which it takes place; whether it be by repelling\nfrom a particular trade the stock which would otherwise go to it, or by\nattracting towards a particular trade that which would not otherwise come\nto it. If, without any exclusive company, the trade of Holland to the East\nIndies would be greater than it actually is, that country must suffer a\nconsiderable loss, by part of its capital being excluded from the\nemployment most convenient for that port. And, in the same manner, if,\nwithout an exclusive company, the trade of Sweden and Denmark to the East\nIndies would be less than it actually is, or, what perhaps is more\nprobable, would not exist at all, those two countries must likewise suffer\na considerable loss, by part of their capital being drawn into an\nemployment which must be more or less unsuitable to their present\ncircumstances. Better for them, perhaps, in the present circumstances, to\nbuy East India goods of other nations, even though they should pay\nsomewhat dearer, than to turn so great a part of their small capital to so\nvery distant a trade, in which the returns are so very slow, in which that\ncapital can maintain so small a quantity of productive labour at home,\nwhere productive labour is so much wanted, where so little is done, and\nwhere so much is to do.\nThough without an exclusive company, therefore, a particular country\nshould not be able to carry on any direct trade to the East Indies, it\nwill not from thence follow, that such a company ought to be established\nthere, but only that such a country ought not, in these circumstances, to\ntrade directly to the East Indies. That such companies are not in general\nnecessary for carrying on the East India trade, is sufficiently\ndemonstrated by the experience of the Portuguese, who enjoyed almost the\nwhole of it for more than a century together, without any exclusive\ncompany.\nNo private merchant, it has been said, could well have capital sufficient\nto maintain factors and agents in the different ports of the East Indies,\nin order to provide goods for the ships which he might occasionally send\nthither; and yet, unless he was able to do this, the difficulty of finding\na cargo might frequently make his ships lose the season for returning; and\nthe expense of so long a delay would not only eat up the whole profit of\nthe adventure, but frequently occasion a very considerable loss. This\nargument, however, if it proved any thing at all, would prove that no one\ngreat branch of trade could be carried on without an exclusive company,\nwhich is contrary to the experience of all nations. There is no great\nbranch of trade, in which the capital of any one private merchant is\nsufficient for carrying on all the subordinate branches which must be\ncarried on, in order to carry on the principal one. But when a nation is\nripe for any great branch of trade, some merchants naturally turn their\ncapitals towards the principal, and some towards the subordinate branches\nof it; and though all the different branches of it are in this manner\ncarried on, yet it very seldom happens that they are all carried on by the\ncapital of one private merchant. If a nation, therefore, is ripe for the\nEast India trade, a certain portion of its capital will naturally divide\nitself among all the different branches of that trade. Some of its\nmerchants will find it for their interest to reside in the East Indies,\nand to employ their capitals there in providing goods for the ships which\nare to be sent out by other merchants who reside in Europe. The\nsettlements which different European nations have obtained in the East\nIndies, if they were taken from the exclusive companies to which they at\npresent belong, and put under the immediate protection of the sovereign,\nwould render this residence both safe and easy, at least to the merchants\nof the particular nations to whom those settlements belong. If, at any\nparticular time, that part of the capital of any country which of its own\naccord tended and inclined, if I may say so, towards the East India trade,\nwas not sufficient for carrying on all those different branches of it, it\nwould be a proof that, at that particular time, that country was not ripe\nfor that trade, and that it would do better to buy for some time, even at\na higher price, from other European nations, the East India goods it had\noccasion for, than to import them itself directly from the East Indies.\nWhat it might lose by the high price of those goods, could seldom be equal\nto the loss which it would sustain by the distraction of a large portion\nof its capital from other employments more necessary, or more useful, or\nmore suitable to its circumstances and situation, than a direct trade to\nthe East Indies.\nThough the Europeans possess many considerable settlements both upon the\ncoast of Africa and in the East Indies, they have not yet established, in\neither of those countries, such numerous and thriving colonies as those in\nthe islands and continent of America. Africa, however, as well as several\nof the countries comprehended under the general name of the East Indies,\nis inhabited by barbarous nations. But those nations were by no means so\nweak and defenceless as the miserable and helpless Americans; and in\nproportion to the natural fertility of the countries which they inhabited,\nthey were, besides, much more populous. The most barbarous nations either\nof Africa or of the East Indies, were shepherds; even the Hottentots were\nso. But the natives of every part of America, except Mexico and Peru, were\nonly hunters and the difference is very great between the number of\nshepherds and that of hunters whom the same extent of equally fertile\nterritory can maintain. In Africa and the East Indies, therefore, it was\nmore difficult to displace the natives, and to extend the European\nplantations over the greater part of the lands of the original\ninhabitants. The genius of exclusive companies, besides, is unfavourable,\nit has already been observed, to the growth of new colonies, and has\nprobably been the principal cause of the little progress which they have\nmade in the East Indies. The Portuguese carried on the trade both to\nAfrica and the East Indies, without any exclusive companies; and their\nsettlements at Congo, Angola, and Benguela, on the coast of Africa, and at\nGoa in the East Indies though much depressed by superstition and every\nsort of bad government, yet bear some resemblance to the colonies of\nAmerica, and are partly inhabited by Portuguese who have been established\nthere for several generations. The Dutch settlements at the Cape of Good\nHope and at Batavia, are at present the most considerable colonies which\nthe Europeans have established, either in Africa or in the East Indies;\nand both those settlements are peculiarly fortunate in their situation. The\nCape of Good Hope was inhabited by a race of people almost as barbarous,\nand quite as incapable of defending themselves, as the natives of America.\nIt is, besides, the half-way house, if one may say so, between Europe and\nthe East Indies, at which almost every European ship makes some stay, both\nin going and returning. The supplying of those ships with every sort of\nfresh provisions, with fruit, and sometimes with wine, affords alone a\nvery extensive market for the surplus produce of the colonies. What the\nCape of Good Hope is between Europe and every part of the East Indies,\nBatavia is between the principal countries of the East Indies. It lies\nupon the most frequented road from Indostan to China and Japan, and is\nnearly about mid-way upon that road. Almost all the ships too, that sail\nbetween Europe and China, touch at Batavia; and it is, over and above all\nthis, the centre and principal mart of what is called the country trade of\nthe East Indies; not only of that part of it which is carried on by\nEuropeans, but of that which is carried on by the native Indians; and\nvessels navigated by the inhabitants of China and Japan, of Tonquin,\nMalacca, Cochin-China, and the island of Celebes, are frequently to be\nseen in its port. Such advantageous situations have enabled those two\ncolonies to surmount all the obstacles which the oppressive genius of an\nexclusive company may have occasionally opposed to their growth. They have\nenabled Batavia to surmount the additional disadvantage of perhaps the\nmost unwholesome climate in the world.\nThe English and Dutch companies, though they have established no\nconsiderable colonies, except the two above mentioned, have both made\nconsiderable conquests in the East Indies. But in the manner in which they\nboth govern their new subjects, the natural genius of an exclusive company\nhas shewn itself most distinctly. In the spice islands, the Dutch are said\nto burn all the spiceries which a fertile season produces, beyond what\nthey expect to dispose of in Europe with such a profit as they think\nsufficient. In the islands where they have no settlements, they give a\npremium to those who collect the young blossoms and green leaves of the\nclove and nutmeg trees, which naturally grow there, but which this savage\npolicy has now, it is said, almost completely extirpated. Even in the\nislands where they have settlements, they have very much reduced, it is\nsaid, the number of those trees. If the produce even of their own islands\nwas much greater than what suited their market, the natives, they suspect,\nmight find means to convey some part of it to other nations; and the best\nway, they imagine, to secure their own monopoly, is to take care that no\nmore shall grow than what they themselves carry to market. By different\narts of oppression, they have reduced the population of several of the\nMoluccas nearly to the number which is sufficient to supply with fresh\nprovisions, and other necessaries of life, their own insignificant\ngarrisons, and such of their ships as occasionally come there for a cargo\nof spices. Under the government even of the Portuguese, however, those\nislands are said to have been tolerably well inhabited. The English\ncompany have not yet had time to establish in Bengal so perfectly\ndestructive a system. The plan of their government, however, has had\nexactly the same tendency. It has not been uncommon, I am well assured,\nfor the chief, that is, the first clerk or a factory, to order a peasant\nto plough up a rich field of poppies, and sow it with rice, or some other\ngrain. The pretence was, to prevent a scarcity of provisions; but the real\nreason, to give the chief an opportunity of selling at a better price a\nlarge quantity of opium which he happened then to have upon hand. Upon\nother occasions, the order has been reversed; and a rich field of rice or\nother grain has been ploughed up, in order to make room for a plantation\nof poppies, when the chief foresaw that extraordinary profit was likely to\nbe made by opium. The servants of the company have, upon several\noccasions, attempted to establish in their own favour the monopoly of some\nof the most important branches, not only of the foreign, but of the inland\ntrade of the country. Had they been allowed to go on, it is impossible\nthat they should not, at some time or another, have attempted to restrain\nthe production of the particular articles of which they had thus usurped\nthe monopoly, not only to the quantity which they themselves could\npurchase, but to that which they could expect to sell with such a profit\nas they might think sufficient. In the course of a century or two, the\npolicy of the English company would, in this manner, have probably proved\nas completely destructive as that of the Dutch.\nNothing, however, can be more directly contrary to the real interest of\nthose companies, considered as the sovereigns of the countries which they\nhave conquered, than this destructive plan. In almost all countries, the\nrevenue of the sovereign is drawn from that of the people. The greater the\nrevenue of the people, therefore, the greater the annual produce of their\nland and labour, the more they can afford to the sovereign. It is his\ninterest, therefore, to increase as much as possible that annual produce.\nBut if this is the interest of every sovereign, it is peculiarly so of one\nwhose revenue, like that of the sovereign of Bengal, arises chiefly from a\nland-rent. That rent must necessarily be in proportion to the quantity and\nvalue of the produce; and both the one and the other must depend upon the\nextent of the market. The quantity will always be suited, with more or\nless exactness, to the consumption of those who can afford to pay for it;\nand the price which they will pay will always be in proportion to the\neagerness of their competition. It is the interest of such a sovereign,\ntherefore, to open the most extensive market for the produce of his\ncountry, to allow the most perfect freedom of commerce, in order to\nincrease as much as possible the number and competition of buyers; and\nupon this account to abolish, not only all monopolies, but all restraints\nupon the transportation of the home produce from one part of the country\nto another, upon its exportation to foreign countries, or upon the\nimportation of goods of any kind for which it can be exchanged. He is in\nthis manner most likely to increase both the quantity and value of that\nproduce, and consequently of his own share of it, or of his own revenue.\nBut a company of merchants, are, it seems, incapable of considering\nthemselves as sovereigns, even after they have become such. Trade, or\nbuying in order to sell again, they still consider as their principal\nbusiness, and by a strange absurdity, regard the character of the\nsovereign as but an appendix to that of the merchant; as something which\nought to be made subservient to it, or by means of which they may be\nenabled to buy cheaper in India, and thereby to sell with a better profit\nin Europe. They endeavour, for this purpose, to keep out as much as\npossible all competitors from the market of the countries which are\nsubject to their government, and consequently to reduce, at least, some\npart of the surplus produce of those countries to what is barely\nsufficient for supplying their own demand, or to what they can expect to\nsell in Europe, with such a profit as they may think reasonable. Their\nmercantile habits draw them in this manner, almost necessarily, though\nperhaps insensibly, to prefer, upon all ordinary occasions, the little and\ntransitory profit of the monopolist to the great and permanent revenue of\nthe sovereign; and would gradually lead them to treat the countries\nsubject to their government nearly as the Dutch treat the Moluccas. It is\nthe interest of the East India company, considered as sovereigns, that the\nEuropean goods which are carried to their Indian dominions should be sold\nthere as cheap as possible; and that the Indian goods which are brought\nfrom thence should bring there as good a price, or should be sold there as\ndear as possible. But the reverse of this is their interest as merchants.\nAs sovereigns, their interest is exactly the same with that of the country\nwhich they govern. As merchants, their interest is directly opposite to\nthat interest.\nBut if the genius of such a government, even as to what concerns its\ndirection in Europe, is in this manner essentially, and perhaps incurably\nfaulty, that of its administration in India is still more so. That\nadministration is necessarily composed of a council of merchants, a\nprofession no doubt extremely respectable, but which in no country in the\nworld carries along with it that sort of authority which naturally\noverawes the people, and without force commands their willing obedience.\nSuch a council can command obedience only by the military force with which\nthey are accompanied; and their government is, therefore, necessarily\nmilitary and despotical. Their proper business, however, is that of\nmerchants. It is to sell, upon their master\u2019s account, the European goods\nconsigned to them, and to buy, in return, Indian goods for the European\nmarket. It is to sell the one as dear, and to buy the other as cheap as\npossible, and consequently to exclude, as much as possible, all rivals\nfrom the particular market where they keep their shop. The genius of the\nadministration, therefore, so far as concerns the trade of the company, is\nthe same as that of the direction. It tends to make government subservient\nto the interest of monopoly, and consequently to stunt the natural growth\nof some parts, at least, of the surplus produce of the country, to what is\nbarely sufficient for answering the demand of the company.\nAll the members of the administration besides, trade more or less upon\ntheir own account; and it is in vain to prohibit them from doing so.\nNothing can be more completely foolish than to expect that the clerk of a\ngreat counting-house, at ten thousand miles distance, and consequently\nalmost quite out of sight, should, upon a simple order from their master,\ngive up at once doing any sort of business upon their own account abandon\nfor ever all hopes of making a fortune, of which they have the means in\ntheir hands; and content themselves with the moderate salaries which those\nmasters allow them, and which, moderate as they are, can seldom be\naugmented, being commonly as large as the real profits of the company\ntrade can afford. In such circumstances, to prohibit the servants of the\ncompany from trading upon their own account, can have scarce any other\neffect than to enable its superior servants, under pretence of executing\ntheir master\u2019s order, to oppress such of the inferior ones as have had the\nmisfortune to fall under their displeasure. The servants naturally\nendeavour to establish the same monopoly in favour of their own private\ntrade as of the public trade of the company. If they are suffered to act\nas they could wish, they will establish this monopoly openly and directly,\nby fairly prohibiting all other people from trading in the articles in\nwhich they choose to deal; and this, perhaps, is the best and least\noppressive way of establishing it. But if, by an order from Europe, they\nare prohibited from doing this, they will, notwithstanding, endeavour to\nestablish a monopoly of the same kind secretly and indirectly, in a way\nthat is much more destructive to the country. They will employ the whole\nauthority of government, and pervert the administration of Justice, in\norder to harass and ruin those who interfere with them in any branch of\ncommerce, which by means of agents, either concealed, or at least not\npublicly avowed, they may choose to carry on. But the private trade of the\nservants will naturally extend to a much greater variety of articles than\nthe public trade of the company. The public trade of the company extends\nno further than the trade with Europe, and comprehends a part only of the\nforeign trade of the country. But the private trade of the servants may\nextend to all the different branches both of its inland and foreign trade.\nThe monopoly of the company can tend only to stunt the natural growth of\nthat part of the surplus produce which, in the case of a free trade, would\nbe exported to Europe. That of the servants tends to stunt the natural\ngrowth of every part of the produce in which they choose to deal; of what\nis destined for home consumption, as well as of what is destined for\nexportation; and consequently to degrade the cultivation of the whole\ncountry, and to reduce the number of its inhabitants. It tends to reduce\nthe quantity of every sort of produce, even that of the necessaries of\nlife, whenever the servants of the country choose to deal in them, to what\nthose servants can both afford to buy and expect to sell with such a\nprofit as pleases them.\nFrom the nature of their situation, too, the servants must be more\ndisposed to support with rigourous severity their own interest, against\nthat of the country which they govern, than their masters can be to\nsupport theirs. The country belongs to their masters, who cannot avoid\nhaving some regard for the interest of what belongs to them; but it does\nnot belong to the servants. The real interest of their masters, if they\nwere capable of understanding it, is the same with that of the country;\n{The interest of every proprietor of India stock, however, is by no means\nthe same with that of the country in the government of which his vote\ngives him some influence.\u2014See book v, chap. 1, part ii.}and it is\nfrom ignorance chiefly, and the meanness of mercantile prejudice, that\nthey ever oppress it. But the real interest of the servants is by no means\nthe same with that of the country, and the most perfect information would\nnot necessarily put an end to their oppressions. The regulations,\naccordingly, which have been sent out from Europe, though they have been\nfrequently weak, have upon most occasions been well meaning. More\nintelligence, and perhaps less good meaning, has sometimes appeared in\nthose established by the servants in India. It is a very singular\ngovernment in which every member of the administration wishes to get out\nof the country, and consequently to have done with the government, as soon\nas he can, and to whose interest, the day after he has left it, and\ncarried his whole fortune with him, it is perfectly indifferent though the\nwhole country was swallowed up by an earthquake.\nI mean not, however, by any thing which I have here said, to throw any\nodious imputation upon the general character of the servants of the East\nIndia company, and touch less upon that of any particular persons. It is\nthe system of government, the situation in which they are placed, that I\nmean to censure, not the character of those who have acted in it. They\nacted as their situation naturally directed, and they who have clamoured\nthe loudest against them would probably not have acted better themselves.\nIn war and negotiation, the councils of Madras and Calcutta, have upon\nseveral occasions, conducted themselves with a resolution and decisive\nwisdom, which would have done honour to the senate of Rome in the best\ndays of that republic. The members of those councils, however, had been\nbred to professions very different from war and politics. But their\nsituation alone, without education, experience, or even example, seems to\nhave formed in them all at once the great qualities which it required, and\nto have inspired them both with abilities and virtues which they\nthemselves could not well know that they possessed. If upon some\noccasions, therefore, it has animated them to actions of magnanimity which\ncould not well have been expected from them, we should not wonder if, upon\nothers, it has prompted them to exploits of somewhat a different nature.\nSuch exclusive companies, therefore, are nuisances in every respect;\nalways more or less inconvenient to the countries in which they are\nestablished, and destructive to those which have the misfortune to fall\nunder their government.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nCONCLUSION OF THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM.\nThough the encouragement of exportation, and the discouragement of\nimportation, are the two great engines by which the mercantile system\nproposes to enrich every country, yet, with regard to some particular\ncommodities, it seems to follow an opposite plan: to discourage\nexportation, and to encourage importation. Its ultimate object, however,\nit pretends, is always the same, to enrich the country by an advantageous\nbalance of trade. It discourages the exportation of the materials of\nmanufacture, and of the instruments of trade, in order to give our own\nworkmen an advantage, and to enable them to undersell those of other\nnations in all foreign markets; and by restraining, in this manner, the\nexportation of a few commodities, of no great price, it proposes to\noccasion a much greater and more valuable exportation of others. It\nencourages the importation of the materials of manufacture, in order that\nour own people may be enabled to work them up more cheaply, and thereby\nprevent a greater and more valuable importation of the manufactured\ncommodities. I do not observe, at least in our statute book, any\nencouragement given to the importation of the instruments of trade. When\nmanufactures have advanced to a certain pitch of greatness, the\nfabrication of the instruments of trade becomes itself the object of a\ngreat number of very important manufactures. To give any particular\nencouragement to the importation of such instruments, would interfere too\nmuch with the interest of those manufactures. Such importation, therefore,\ninstead of being encouraged, has frequently been prohibited. Thus the\nimportation of wool cards, except from Ireland, or when brought in as\nwreck or prize goods, was prohibited by the 3rd of Edward IV.; which\nprohibition was renewed by the 39th of Elizabeth, and has been continued\nand rendered perpetual by subsequent laws.\nThe importation of the materials of manufacture has sometimes been\nencouraged by an exemption from the duties to which other goods are\nsubject, and sometimes by bounties.\nThe importation of sheep\u2019s wool from several different countries, of\ncotton wool from all countries, of undressed flax, of the greater part of\ndyeing drugs, of the greater part of undressed hides from Ireland, or the\nBritish colonies, of seal skins from the British Greenland fishery, of pig\nand bar iron from the British colonies, as well as of several other\nmaterials of manufacture, has been encouraged by an exemption from all\nduties, if properly entered at the custom-house. The private interest of\nour merchants and manufacturers may, perhaps, have extorted from the\nlegislature these exemptions, as well as the greater part of our other\ncommercial regulations. They are, however, perfectly just and reasonable;\nand if, consistently with the necessities of the state, they could be\nextended to all the other materials of manufacture, the public would\ncertainly be a gainer.\nThe avidity of our great manufacturers, however, has in some cases\nextended these exemptions a good deal beyond what can justly be considered\nas the rude materials of their work. By the 24th Geo. II. chap. 46, a\nsmall duty of only 1d. the pound was imposed upon the importation of\nforeign brown linen yarn, instead of much higher duties, to which it had\nbeen subjected before, viz. of 6d. the pound upon sail yarn, of 1s. the\npound upon all French and Dutch yarn, and of \u00a32:13:4 upon the hundred\nweight of all spruce or Muscovia yarn. But our manufacturers were not long\nsatisfied with this reduction: by the 29th of the same king, chap. 15, the\nsame law which gave a bounty upon the exportation of British and Irish\nlinen, of which the price did not exceed 18d. the yard, even this small\nduty upon the importation of brown linen yarn was taken away. In the\ndifferent operations, however, which are necessary for the preparation of\nlinen yarn, a good deal more industry is employed, than in the subsequent\noperation of preparing linen cloth from linen yarn. To say nothing of the\nindustry of the flax-growers and flaxdressers, three or four spinners at\nleast are necessary in order to keep one weaver in constant employment;\nand more than four-fifths of the whole quantity of labour necessary for\nthe preparation of linen cloth, is employed in that of linen yarn; but our\nspinners are poor people; women commonly scattered about in all different\nparts of the country, without support or protection. It is not by the sale\nof their work, but by that of the complete work of the weavers, that our\ngreat master manufacturers make their profits. As it is their interest to\nsell the complete manufacture as dear, so it is to buy the materials as\ncheap as possible. By extorting from the legislature bounties upon the\nexportation of their own linen, high duties upon the importation of all\nforeign linen, and a total prohibition of the home consumption of some\nsorts of French linen, they endeavour to sell their own goods as dear as\npossible. By encouraging the importation of foreign linen yarn, and\nthereby bringing it into competition with that which is made by our own\npeople, they endeavour to buy the work of the poor spinners as cheap as\npossible. They are as intent to keep down the wages of their own weavers,\nas the earnings of the poor spinners; and it is by no means for the\nbenefit of the workmen that they endeavour either to raise the price of\nthe complete work, or to lower that of the rude materials. It is the\nindustry which is carried on for the benefit of the rich and the powerful,\nthat is principally encouraged by our mercantile system. That which is\ncarried on for the benefit of the poor and the indigent is too often\neither neglected or oppressed.\nBoth the bounty upon the exportation of linen, and the exemption from the\nduty upon the importation of foreign yarn, which were granted only for\nfifteen years, but continued by two different prolongations, expire with\nthe end of the session of parliament which shall immediately follow the\n24th of June 1786.\nThe encouragement given to the importation of the materials of manufacture\nby bounties, has been principally confined to such as were imported from\nour American plantations.\nThe first bounties of this kind were those granted about the beginning of\nthe present century, upon the importation of naval stores from America.\nUnder this denomination were comprehended timber fit for masts, yards, and\nbowsprits; hemp, tar, pitch, and turpentine. The bounty, however, of \u00a31\nthe ton upon masting-timber, and that of \u00a36 the ton upon hemp, were\nextended to such as should be imported into England from Scotland. Both\nthese bounties continued, without any variation, at the same rate, till\nthey were severally allowed to expire; that upon hemp on the 1st of\nJanuary 1741, and that upon masting-timber at the end of the session of\nparliament immediately following the 24th June 1781.\nThe bounties upon the importation of tar, pitch, and turpentine,\nunderwent, during their continuance, several alterations. Originally, that\nupon tar was \u00a34 the ton; that upon pitch the same; and that upon\nturpentine \u00a33 the ton. The bounty of \u00a34 the ton upon tar was afterwards\nconfined to such as had been prepared in a particular manner; that upon\nother good, clean, and merchantable tar was reduced to \u00a32:4s. the ton. The\nbounty upon pitch was likewise reduced to \u00a31, and that upon turpentine to\n\u00a31:10s. the ton.\nThe second bounty upon the importation of any of the materials of\nmanufacture, according to the order of time, was that granted by the 21st\nGeo. II. chap.30, upon the importation of indigo from the British\nplantations. When the plantation indigo was worth three-fourths of the\nprice of the best French indigo, it was, by this act, entitled to a bounty\nof 6d. the pound. This bounty, which, like most others, was granted only\nfor a limited time, was continued by several prolongations, but was\nreduced to 4d. the pound. It was allowed to expire with the end of the\nsession of parliament which followed the 25th March 1781.\nThe third bounty of this kind was that granted (much about the time that\nwe were beginning sometimes to court, and sometimes to quarrel with our\nAmerican colonies), by the 4th. Geo. III. chap. 26, upon the importation\nof hemp, or undressed flax, from the British plantations. This bounty was\ngranted for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1764 to the 24th June\n1785. For the first seven years, it was to be at the rate of \u00a38 the ton;\nfor the second at \u00a36; and for the third at \u00a34. It was not extended to\nScotland, of which the climate (although hemp is sometimes raised there in\nsmall quantities, and of an inferior quality) is not very fit for that\nproduce. Such a bounty upon the importation of Scotch flax in England\nwould have been too great a discouragement to the native produce of the\nsouthern part of the united kingdom.\nThe fourth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 5th Geo. III. chap.\n45, upon the importation of wood from America. It was granted for nine\nyears from the 1st January 1766 to the 1st January 1775. During the first\nthree years, it was to be for every hundred-and-twenty good deals, at the\nrate of \u00a31, and for every load containing fifty cubic feet of other square\ntimber, at the rate of 12s. For the second three years, it was for deals,\nto be at the rate of 15s., and for other squared timber at the rate of\n8s.; and for the third three years, it was for deals, to be at the rate of\n10s.; and for every other squared timber at the rate of 5s.\nThe fifth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 9th Geo. III. chap.\n38, upon the importation of raw silk from the British plantations. It was\ngranted for twenty-one years, from the 1st January 1770, to the 1st\nJanuary 1791. For the first seven years, it was to be at the rate of \u00a325\nfor every hundred pounds value; for the second, at \u00a320; and for the third,\nat \u00a315. The management of the silk-worm, and the preparation of silk,\nrequires so much hand-labour, and labour is so very dear in America, that\neven this great bounty, I have been informed, was not likely to produce\nany considerable effect.\nThe sixth Bounty of this kind was that granted by 11th Geo. III. chap. 50,\nfor the importation of pipe, hogshead, and barrelstaves and leading from\nthe British plantations. It was granted for nine years, from 1st January\n1772 to the 1st January 1781. For the first three years, it was, for a\ncertain quantity of each, to be at the rate of \u00a36; for the second three\nyears at \u00a34; and for the third three years at \u00a32.\nThe seventh and last bounty of this kind was that granted by the 19th Geo.\nIII chap. 37, upon the importation of hemp from Ireland. It was granted in\nthe same manner as that for the importation of hemp and undressed flax\nfrom America, for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1779 to the 24th\nJune 1800. The term is divided likewise into three periods, of seven years\neach; and in each of those periods, the rate of the Irish bounty is the\nsame with that of the American. It does not, however, like the American\nbounty, extend to the importation of undressed flax. It would have been\ntoo great a discouragement to the cultivation of that plant in Great\nBritain. When this last bounty was granted, the British and Irish\nlegislatures were not in much better humour with one another, than the\nBritish and American had been before. But this boon to Ireland, it is to\nbe hoped, has been granted under more fortunate auspices than all those to\nAmerica. The same commodities, upon which we thus gave bounties, when\nimported from America, were subjected to considerable duties when imported\nfrom any other country. The interest of our American colonies was regarded\nas the same with that of the mother country. Their wealth was considered\nas our wealth. Whatever money was sent out to them, it was said, came all\nback to us by the balance of trade, and we could never become a farthing\nthe poorer by any expense which we could lay out upon them. They were our\nown in every respect, and it was an expense laid out upon the improvement\nof our own property, and for the profitable employment of our own people.\nIt is unnecessary, I apprehend, at present to say anything further, in\norder to expose the folly of a system which fatal experience has now\nsufficiently exposed. Had our American colonies really been a part of\nGreat Britain, those bounties might have been considered as bounties upon\nproduction, and would still have been liable to all the objections to\nwhich such bounties are liable, but to no other.\nThe exportation of the materials of manufacture is sometimes discouraged\nby absolute prohibitions, and sometimes by high duties.\nOur woollen manufacturers have been more successful than any other class\nof workmen, in persuading the legislature that the prosperity of the\nnation depended upon the success and extension of their particular\nbusiness. They have not only obtained a monopoly against the consumers, by\nan absolute prohibition of importing woollen cloths from any foreign\ncountry; but they have likewise obtained another monopoly against the\nsheep farmers and growers of wool, by a similar prohibition of the\nexportation of live sheep and wool. The severity of many of the laws which\nhave been enacted for the security of the revenue is very justly\ncomplained of, as imposing heavy penalties upon actions which, antecedent\nto the statutes that declared them to be crimes, had always been\nunderstood to be innocent. But the cruellest of our revenue laws, I will\nventure to affirm, are mild and gentle, in comparison to some of those\nwhich the clamour of our merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the\nlegislature, for the support of their own absurd and oppressive\nmonopolies. Like the laws of Draco, these laws may be said to be all\nwritten in blood.\nBy the 8th of Elizabeth, chap. 3, the exporter of sheep, lambs, or rams,\nwas for the first offence, to forfeit all his goods for ever, to suffer a\nyear\u2019s imprisonment, and then to have his left hand cut off in a market\ntown, upon a market day, to be there nailed up; and for the second\noffence, to be adjudged a felon, and to suffer death accordingly. To\nprevent the breed of our sheep from being propagated in foreign countries,\nseems to have been the object of this law. By the 13th and 14th of Charles\nII. chap. 18, the exportation of wool was made felony, and the exporter\nsubjected to the same penalties and forfeitures as a felon.\nFor the honour of the national humanity, it is to be hoped that neither of\nthese statutes was ever executed. The first of them, however, so far as I\nknow, has never been directly repealed, and serjeant Hawkins seems to\nconsider it as still in force. It may, however, perhaps be considered as\nvirtually repealed by the 12th of Charles II. chap. 32, sect. 3, which,\nwithout expressly taking away the penalties imposed by former statutes,\nimposes a new penalty, viz. that of 20s. for every sheep exported, or\nattempted to be exported, together with the forfeiture of the sheep, and\nof the owner\u2019s share of the sheep. The second of them was expressly\nrepealed by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 28, sect. 4, by which it\nis declared that \u201cWhereas the statute of the 13th and 14th of king Charles\nII. made against the exportation of wool, among other things in the said\nact mentioned, doth enact the same to be deemed felony, by the severity of\nwhich penalty the prosecution of offenders hath not been so effectually\nput in execution; be it therefore enacted, by the authority aforesaid,\nthat so much of the said act, which relates to the making the said offence\nfelony, be repealed and made void.\u201d\nThe penalties, however, which are either imposed by this milder statute,\nor which, though imposed by former statutes, are not repealed by this one,\nare still sufficiently severe. Besides the forfeiture of the goods, the\nexporter incurs the penalty of 3s. for every pound weight of wool, either\nexported or attempted to be exported, that is, about four or five times\nthe value. Any merchant, or other person convicted of this offence, is\ndisabled from requiring any debt or account belonging to him from any\nfactor or other person. Let his fortune be what it will, whether he is or\nis not able to pay those heavy penalties, the law means to ruin him\ncompletely. But, as the morals of the great body of the people are not yet\nso corrupt as those of the contrivers of this statute, I have not heard\nthat any advantage has ever been taken of this clause. If the person\nconvicted of this offence is not able to pay the penalties within three\nmonths after judgment, he is to be transported for seven years; and if he\nreturns before the expiration of that term, he is liable to the pains of\nfelony, without benefit of clergy. The owner of the ship, knowing this\noffence, forfeits all his interest in the ship and furniture. The master\nand mariners, knowing this offence, forfeit all their goods and chattels,\nand suffer three months imprisonment. By a subsequent statute, the master\nsuffers six months imprisonment.\nIn order to prevent exportation, the whole inland commerce of wool is laid\nunder very burdensome and oppressive restrictions. It cannot be packed in\nany box, barrel, cask, case, chest, or any other package, but only in\npacks of leather or pack-cloth, on which must be marked on the outside the\nwords WOOL or YARN, in large letters, not less than three inches long, on\npain of forfeiting the same and the package, and 8s. for every pound\nweight, to be paid by the owner or packer. It cannot be loaden on any\nhorse or cart, or carried by land within five miles of the coast, but\nbetween sun-rising, and sun-setting, on pain of forfeiting the same, the\nhorses and carriages. The hundred next adjoining to the sea coast, out of,\nor through which the wool is carried or exported, forfeits \u00a320, if the\nwool is under the value of \u00a310; and if of greater value, then treble that\nvalue, together with treble costs, to be sued for within the year. The\nexecution to be against any two of the inhabitants, whom the sessions must\nreimburse, by an assessment on the other inhabitants, as in the cases of\nrobbery. And if any person compounds with the hundred for less than this\npenalty, he is to be imprisoned for five years; and any other person may\nprosecute. These regulations take place through the whole kingdom.\nBut in the particular counties of Kent and Sussex, the restrictions are\nstill more troublesome. Every owner of wool within ten miles of the sea\ncoast must give an account in writing, three days after shearing, to the\nnext officer of the customs, of the number of his fleeces, and of the\nplaces where they are lodged. And before he removes any part of them, he\nmust give the like notice of the number and weight of the fleeces, and of\nthe name and abode of the person to whom they are sold, and of the place\nto which it is intended they should be carried. No person within fifteen\nmiles of the sea, in the said counties, can buy any wool, before he enters\ninto bond to the king, that no part of the wool which he shall so buy\nshall be sold by him to any other person within fifteen miles of the sea.\nIf any wool is found carrying towards the sea side in the said counties,\nunless it has been entered and security given as aforesaid, it is\nforfeited, and the offender also forfeits 3s. for every pound weight, if\nany person lay any wool, not entered as aforesaid, within fifteen miles of\nthe sea, it must be seized and forfeited; and if, after such seizure, any\nperson shall claim the same, he must give security to the exchequer, that\nif he is cast upon trial he shall pay treble costs, besides all other\npenalties.\nWhen such restrictions are imposed upon the inland trade, the coasting\ntrade, we may believe, cannot be left very free. Every owner of wool, who\ncarrieth, or causeth to be carried, any wool to any port or place on the\nsea coast, in order to be from thence transported by sea to any other\nplace or port on the coast, must first cause an entry thereof to be made\nat the port from whence it is intended to be conveyed, containing the\nweight, marks, and number, of the packages, before he brings the same\nwithin five miles of that port, on pain of forfeiting the same, and also\nthe horses, carts, and other carriages; and also of suffering and\nforfeiting, as by the other laws in force against the exportation of wool.\nThis law, however (1st of William III. chap. 32), is so very indulgent as\nto declare, that this shall not hinder any person from carrying his wool\nhome from the place of shearing, though it be within five miles of the\nsea, provided that in ten days after shearing, and before he remove the\nwool, he do under his hand certify to the next officer of the customs the\ntrue number of fleeces, and where it is housed; and do not remove the\nsame, without certifying to such officer, under his hand, his intention so\nto do, three days before. Bond must be given that the wool to be carried\ncoast-ways is to be landed at the particular port for which it is entered\noutwards; and if my part of it is landed without the presence of an\nofficer, not only the forfeiture of the wool is incurred, as in other\ngoods, but the usual additional penalty of 3s. for every pound weight is\nlikewise incurred.\nOur woollen manufacturers, in order to justify their demand of such\nextraordinary restrictions and regulations, confidently asserted, that\nEnglish wool was of a peculiar quality, superior to that of any other\ncountry; that the wool of other countries could not, without some mixture\nof it, be wrought up into any tolerable manufacture; that fine cloth could\nnot be made without it; that England, therefore, if the exportation of it\ncould be totally prevented, could monopolize to herself almost the whole\nwoollen trade of the world; and thus, having no rivals, could sell at what\nprice she pleased, and in a short time acquire the most incredible degree\nof wealth by the most advantageous balance of trade. This doctrine, like\nmost other doctrines which are confidently asserted by any considerable\nnumber of people, was, and still continues to be, most implicitly believed\nby a much greater number: by almost all those who are either unacquainted\nwith the woollen trade, or who have not made particular inquiries. It is,\nhowever, so perfectly false, that English wool is in any respect necessary\nfor the making of fine cloth, that it is altogether unfit for it. Fine\ncloth is made altogether of Spanish wool. English wool, cannot be even so\nmixed with Spanish wool, as to enter into the composition without spoiling\nand degrading, in some degree, the fabric of the cloth.\nIt has been shown in the foregoing part of this work, that the effect of\nthese regulations has been to depress the price of English wool, not only\nbelow what it naturally would be in the present times, but very much below\nwhat it actually was in the time of Edward III. The price of Scotch wool,\nwhen, in consequence of the Union, it became subject to the same\nregulations, is said to have fallen about one half. It is observed by the\nvery accurate and intelligent author of the Memoirs of Wool, the Reverend\nMr John Smith, that the price of the best English wool in England, is\ngenerally below what wool of a very inferior quality commonly sells for in\nthe market of Amsterdam. To depress the price of this commodity below what\nmay be called its natural and proper price, was the avowed purpose of\nthose regulations; and there seems to be no doubt of their having produced\nthe effect that was expected from them.\nThis reduction of price, it may perhaps be thought, by discouraging the\ngrowing of wool, must have reduced very much the annual produce of that\ncommodity, though not below what it formerly was, yet below what, in the\npresent state of things, it would probably have been, had it, in\nconsequence of an open and free market, been allowed to rise to the\nnatural and proper price. I am, however, disposed to believe, that the\nquantity of the annual produce cannot have been much, though it may,\nperhaps, have been a little affected by these regulations. The growing of\nwool is not the chief purpose for which the sheep farmer employs his\nindustry and stock. He expects his profit, not so much from the price of\nthe fleece, as from that of the carcase; and the average or ordinary price\nof the latter must even, in many cases, make up to him whatever deficiency\nthere may be in the average or ordinary price of the former. It has been\nobserved, in the foregoing part of this work, that \u2018whatever regulations\ntend to sink the price, either of wool or of raw hides, below what it\nnaturally would be, must, in an improved and cultivated country, have some\ntendency to raise the price of butcher\u2019s meat. The price, both of the\ngreat and small cattle which are fed on improved and cultivated land, must\nbe sufficient to pay the rent which the landlord, and the profit which the\nfarmer, has reason to expect from improved and cultivated land. If it is\nnot, they will soon cease to feed them. Whatever part of this price,\ntherefore, is not paid by the wool and the hide, must be paid by the\ncarcase. The less there is paid for the one, the more must be paid for the\nother. In what manner this price is to be divided upon the different parts\nof the beast, is indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided it is\nall paid to them. In an improved and cultivated country, therefore, their\ninterest as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such\nregulations, though their interest as consumers may, by the rise in the\nprice of provisions.\u2019 According to this reasoning, therefore, this\ndegradation in the price of wool is not likely, in an improved and\ncultivated country, to occasion any diminution in the annual produce of\nthat commodity; except so far as, by raising the price of mutton, it may\nsomewhat diminish the demand for, and consequently the production of, that\nparticular species of butcher\u2019s meat, Its effect, however, even in this\nway, it is probable, is not very considerable.\nBut though its effect upon the quantity of the annual produce may not have\nbeen very considerable, its effect upon the quality, it may perhaps be\nthought, must necessarily have been very great. The degradation in the\nquality of English wool, if not below what it was in former times, yet\nbelow what it naturally would have been in the present state of\nimprovement and cultivation, must have been, it may perhaps be supposed,\nvery nearly in proportion to the degradation of price. As the quality\ndepends upon the breed, upon the pasture, and upon the management and\ncleanliness of the sheep, during the whole progress of the growth of the\nfleece, the attention to these circumstances, it may naturally enough be\nimagined, can never be greater than in proportion to the recompence which\nthe price of the fleece is likely to make for the labour and expense which\nthat attention requires. It happens, however, that the goodness of the\nfleece depends, in a great measure, upon the health, growth, and bulk of\nthe animal: the same attention which is necessary for the improvement of\nthe carcase is, in some respect, sufficient for that of the fleece.\nNotwithstanding the degradation of price, English wool is said to have\nbeen improved considerably during the course even of the present century.\nThe improvement, might, perhaps, have been greater if the price had been\nbetter; but the lowness of price, though it may have obstructed, yet\ncertainly it has not altogether prevented that improvement.\nThe violence of these regulations, therefore, seems to have affected\nneither the quantity nor the quality of the annual produce of wool, so\nmuch as it might have been expected to do (though I think it probable that\nit may have affected the latter a good deal more than the former); and the\ninterest of the growers of wool, though it must have been hurt in some\ndegree, seems upon the whole, to have been much less hurt than could well\nhave been imagined.\nThese considerations, however, will not justify the absolute prohibition\nof the exportation of wool; but they will fully justify the imposition of\na considerable tax upon that exportation.\nTo hurt, in any degree, the interest of any one order of citizens, for no\nother purpose but to promote that of some other, is evidently contrary to\nthat justice and equality of treatment which the sovereign owes to all the\ndifferent orders of his subjects. But the prohibition certainly hurts, in\nsome degree, the interest of the growers of wool, for no other purpose but\nto promote that of the manufacturers.\nEvery different order of citizens is bound to contribute to the support of\nthe sovereign or commonwealth. A tax of five, or even of ten shillings,\nupon the exportation of every tod of wool, would produce a very\nconsiderable revenue to the sovereign. It would hurt the interest of the\ngrowers somewhat less than the prohibition, because it would not probably\nlower the price of wool quite so much. It would afford a sufficient\nadvantage to the manufacturer, because, though he might not buy his wool\naltogether so cheap as under the prohibition, he would still buy it at\nleast five or ten shillings cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could\nbuy it, besides saving the freight and insurance which the other would be\nobliged to pay. It is scarce possible to devise a tax which could produce\nany considerable revenue to the sovereign, and at the same time occasion\nso little inconveniency to anybody.\nThe prohibition, notwithstanding all the penalties which guard it, does\nnot prevent the exportation of wool. It is exported, it is well known, in\ngreat quantities. The great difference between the price in the home and\nthat in the foreign market, presents such a temptation to smuggling, that\nall the rigour of the law cannot prevent it. This illegal exportation is\nadvantageous to nobody but the smuggler. A legal exportation, subject to a\ntax, by affording a revenue to the sovereign, and thereby saving the\nimposition of some other, perhaps more burdensome and inconvenient taxes,\nmight prove advantageous to all the different subjects of the state.\nThe exportation of fuller\u2019s earth, or fuller\u2019s clay, supposed to be\nnecessary for preparing and cleansing the woollen manufactures, has been\nsubjected to nearly the same penalties as the exportation of wool. Even\ntobacco-pipe clay, though acknowledged to be different from fuller\u2019s clay,\nyet, on account of their resemblance, and because fuller\u2019s clay might\nsometimes be exported as tobacco-pipe clay, has been laid under the same\nprohibitions and penalties.\nBy the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap, 7, the exportation, not only of\nraw hides, but of tanned leather, except in the shape of boots, shoes, or\nslippers, was prohibited; and the law gave a monopoly to our boot-makers\nand shoe-makers, not only against our graziers, but against our tanners.\nBy subsequent statutes, our tanners have got themselves exempted from this\nmonopoly, upon paying a small tax of only one shilling on the hundred\nweight of tanned leather, weighing one hundred and twelve pounds. They\nhave obtained likewise the drawback of two-thirds of the excise duties\nimposed upon their commodity, even when exported without further\nmanufacture. All manufactures of leather may be exported duty free; and\nthe exporter is besides entitled to the drawback of the whole duties of\nexcise. Our graziers still continue subject to the old monopoly. Graziers,\nseparated from one another, and dispersed through all the different\ncorners of the country, cannot, without great difficulty, combine together\nfor the purpose either of imposing monopolies upon their fellow-citizens,\nor of exempting themselves from such as may have been imposed upon them by\nother people. Manufacturers of all kinds, collected together in numerous\nbodies in all great cities, easily can. Even the horns of cattle are\nprohibited to be exported; and the two insignificant trades of the horner\nand comb-maker enjoy, in this respect, a monopoly against the graziers.\nRestraints, either by prohibitions, or by taxes, upon the exportation of\ngoods which are partially, but not completely manufactured, are not\npeculiar to the manufacture of leather. As long as anything remains to be\ndone, in order to fit any commodity for immediate use and consumption, our\nmanufacturers think that they themselves ought to have the doing of it.\nWoollen yarn and worsted are prohibited to be exported, under the same\npenalties as wool even white cloths we subject to a duty upon exportation;\nand our dyers have so far obtained a monopoly against our clothiers. Our\nclothiers would probably have been able to defend themselves against it;\nbut it happens that the greater part of our principal clothiers are\nthemselves likewise dyers. Watch-cases, clock-cases, and dial-plates for\nclocks and watches, have been prohibited to be exported. Our clock-makers\nand watch-makers are, it seems, unwilling that the price of this sort of\nworkmanship should be raised upon them by the competition of foreigners.\nBy some old statutes of Edward III, Henry VIII. and Edward VI. the\nexportation of all metals was prohibited. Lead and tin were alone\nexcepted, probably on account of the great abundance of those metals; in\nthe exportation of which a considerable part of the trade of the kingdom\nin those days consisted. For the encouragement of the mining trade, the\n5th of William and Mary, chap.17, exempted from this prohibition iron,\ncopper, and mundic metal made from British ore. The exportation of all\nsorts of copper bars, foreign as well as British, was afterwards permitted\nby the 9th and 10th of William III. chap 26. The exportation of\nunmanufactured brass, of what is called gun-metal, bell-metal, and shroff\nmetal, still continues to be prohibited. Brass manufactures of all sorts\nmay be exported duty free.\nThe exportation of the materials of manufacture, where it is not\naltogether prohibited, is, in many cases, subjected to considerable\nduties.\nBy the 8th Geo. I. chap.15, the exportation of all goods, the produce of\nmanufacture of Great Britain, upon which any duties had been imposed by\nformer statutes, was rendered duty free. The following goods, however,\nwere excepted: alum, lead, lead-ore, tin, tanned leather, copperas, coals,\nwool, cards, white woollen cloths, lapis calaminaris, skins of all sorts,\nglue, coney hair or wool, hares wool, hair of all sorts, horses, and\nlitharge of lead. If you except horses, all these are either materials of\nmanufacture, or incomplete manufactures (which may be considered as\nmaterials for still further manufacture), or instruments of trade. This\nstatute leaves them subject to all the old duties which had ever been\nimposed upon them, the old subsidy, and one per cent. outwards.\nBy the same statute, a great number of foreign drugs for dyers use are\nexempted from all duties upon importation. Each of them, however, is\nafterwards subjected to a certain duty, not indeed a very heavy one, upon\nexportation. Our dyers, it seems, while they thought it for their interest\nto encourage the importation of those drugs, by an exemption from all\nduties, thought it likewise for their own interest to throw some small\ndiscouragement upon their exportation. The avidity, however, which\nsuggested this notable piece of mercantile ingenuity, most probably\ndisappointed itself of its object. It necessarily taught the importers to\nbe more careful than they might otherwise have been, that their\nimportation should not exceed what was necessary for the supply of the\nhome market. The home market was at all times likely to be more scantily\nsupplied; the commodities were at all times likely to be somewhat dearer\nthere than they would have been, had the exportation been rendered as free\nas the importation.\nBy the above-mentioned statute, gum senega, or gum arabic, being among the\nenumerated dyeing drugs, might be imported duty free. They were subjected,\nindeed, to a small poundage duty, amounting only to threepence in the\nhundred weight, upon their re-exportation. France enjoyed, at that time,\nan exclusive trade to the country most productive of those drugs, that\nwhich lies in the neighbourhood of the Senegal; and the British market\ncould not be easily supplied by the immediate importation of them from the\nplace of growth. By the 25th Geo. II. therefore, gum senega was allowed to\nbe imported (contrary to the general dispositions of the act of\nnavigation) from any part of Europe. As the law, however, did not mean to\nencourage this species of trade, so contrary to the general principles of\nthe mercantile policy of England, it imposed a duty of ten shillings the\nhundred weight upon such importation, and no part of this duty was to be\nafterwards drawn back upon its exportation. The successful war which began\nin 1755 gave Great Britain the same exclusive trade to those countries\nwhich France had enjoyed before. Our manufactures, as soon as the peace\nwas made, endeavoured to avail themselves of this advantage, and to\nestablish a monopoly in their own favour both against the growers and\nagainst the importers of this commodity. By the 5th of Geo. III.\ntherefore, chap. 37, the exportation of gum senega, from his majesty\u2019s\ndominions in Africa, was confined to Great Britain, and was subjected to\nall the same restrictions, regulations, forfeitures, and penalties, as\nthat of the enumerated commodities of the British colonies in America and\nthe West Indies. Its importation, indeed, was subjected to a small duty of\nsixpence the hundred weight; but its re-exportation was subjected to the\nenormous duty of one pound ten shillings the hundred weight. It was the\nintention of our manufacturers, that the whole produce of those countries\nshould be imported into Great Britain; and in order that they themselves\nmight be enabled to buy it at their own price, that no part of it should\nbe exported again, but at such an expense as would sufficiently discourage\nthat exportation. Their avidity, however, upon this, as well as upon many\nother occasions, disappointed itself of its object. This enormous duty\npresented such a temptation to smuggling, that great quantities of this\ncommodity were clandestinely exported, probably to all the manufacturing\ncountries of Europe, but particularly to Holland, not only from Great\nBritain, but from Africa. Upon this account, by the 14th Geo. III.\nchap.10, this duty upon exportation was reduced to five shillings the\nhundred weight.\nIn the book of rates, according to which the old subsidy was levied,\nbeaver skins were estimated at six shillings and eight pence a piece; and\nthe different subsidies and imposts which, before the year 1722, had been\nlaid upon their importation, amounted to one-fifth part of the rate, or to\nsixteen pence upon each skin; all of which, except half the old subsidy,\namounting only to twopence, was drawn back upon exportation. This duty,\nupon the importation of so important a material of manufacture, had been\nthought too high; and, in the year 1722, the rate was reduced to two\nshillings and sixpence, which reduced the duty upon importation to\nsixpence, and of this only one-half was to be drawn back upon exportation.\nThe same successful war put the country most productive of beaver under\nthe dominion of Great Britain; and beaver skins being among the enumerated\ncommodities, the exportation from America was consequently confined to the\nmarket of Great Britain. Our manufacturers soon bethought themselves of\nthe advantage which they might make of this circumstance; and in the year\n1764, the duty upon the importation of beaver skin was reduced to one\npenny, but the duty upon exportation was raised to sevenpence each skin,\nwithout any drawback of the duty upon importation. By the same law, a duty\nof eighteen pence the pound was imposed upon the exportation of beaver\nwool or woumbs, without making any alteration in the duty upon the\nimportation of that commodity, which, when imported by British, and in\nBritish shipping, amounted at that time to between fourpence and fivepence\nthe piece.\nCoals may be considered both as a material of manufacture, and as an\ninstrument of trade. Heavy duties, accordingly, have been imposed upon\ntheir exportation, amounting at present (1783) to more than five shillings\nthe ton, or more than fifteen shillings the chaldron, Newcastle measure;\nwhich is, in most cases, more than the original value of the commodity at\nthe coal-pit, or even at the shipping port for exportation.\nThe exportation, however, of the instruments of trade, properly so called,\nis commonly restrained, not by high duties, but by absolute prohibitions.\nThus, by the 7th and 8th of William III chap.20, sect.8, the exportation\nof frames or engines for knitting gloves or stockings, is prohibited,\nunder the penalty, not only of the forfeiture of such frames or engines,\nso exported, or attempted to be exported, but of forty pounds, one half to\nthe king, the other to the person who shall inform or sue for the same. In\nthe same manner, by the 14th Geo. III. chap. 71, the exportation to\nforeign parts, of any utensils made use of in the cotton, linen, woollen,\nand silk manufactures, is prohibited under the penalty, not only of the\nforfeiture of such utensils, but of two hundred pounds, to be paid by the\nperson who shall offend in this manner; and likewise of two hundred\npounds, to be paid by the master of the ship, who shall knowingly suffer\nsuch utensils to be loaded on board his ship.\nWhen such heavy penalties were imposed upon the exportation of the dead\ninstruments of trade, it could not well be expected that the living\ninstrument, the artificer, should be allowed to go free. Accordingly, by\nthe 5th Geo. I. chap. 27, the person who shall be convicted of enticing\nany artificer, of or in any of the manufactures of Great Britain, to go\ninto any foreign parts, in order to practise or teach his trade, is\nliable, for the first offence, to be fined in any sum not exceeding one\nhundred pounds, and to three months imprisonment, and until the fine shall\nbe paid; and for the second offence, to be fined in any sum, at the\ndiscretion of the court, and to imprisonment for twelve months, and until\nthe fine shall be paid. By the 23d Geo. II. chap. 13, this penalty is\nincreased, for the first offence, to five hundred pounds for every\nartificer so enticed, and to twelve months imprisonment, and until the\nfine shall be paid; and for the second offence, to one thousand pounds,\nand to two years imprisonment, and until the fine shall be paid.\nBy the former of these two statutes, upon proof that any person has been\nenticing any artificer, or that any artificer has promised or contracted\nto go into foreign parts, for the purposes aforesaid, such artificer may\nbe obliged to give security, at the discretion of the court, that he shall\nnot go beyond the seas, and may be committed to prison until he give such\nsecurity.\nIf any artificer has gone beyond the seas, and is exercising or teaching\nhis trade in any foreign country, upon warning being given to him by any\nof his majesty\u2019s ministers or consuls abroad, or by one of his majesty\u2019s\nsecretaries of state, for the time being, if he does not, within six\nmonths after such warning, return into this realm, and from henceforth\nabide and inhabit continually within the same, he is from thenceforth\ndeclared incapable of taking any legacy devised to him within this\nkingdom, or of being executor or administrator to any person, or of taking\nany lands within this kingdom, by descent, devise, or purchase. He\nlikewise forfeits to the king all his lands, goods, and chattels; is\ndeclared an alien in every respect; and is put out of the king\u2019s\nprotection.\nIt is unnecessary, I imagine, to observe how contrary such regulations are\nto the boasted liberty of the subject, of which we affect to be so very\njealous; but which, in this case, is so plainly sacrificed to the futile\ninterests of our merchants and manufacturers.\nThe laudable motive of all these regulations, is to extend our own\nmanufactures, not by their own improvement, but by the depression of those\nof all our neighbours, and by putting an end, as much as possible, to the\ntroublesome competition of such odious and disagreeable rivals. Our master\nmanufacturers think it reasonable that they themselves should have the\nmonopoly of the ingenuity of all their countrymen. Though by restraining,\nin some trades, the number of apprentices which can be employed at one\ntime, and by imposing the necessity of a long apprenticeship in all\ntrades, they endeavour, all of them, to confine the knowledge of their\nrespective employments to as small a number as possible; they are\nunwilling, however, that any part of this small number should go abroad to\ninstruct foreigners.\nConsumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the\ninterest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be\nnecessary for promoting that of the consumer.\nThe maxim is so perfectly self-evident, that it would be absurd to attempt\nto prove it. But in the mercantile system, the interest of the consumer is\nalmost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer; and it seems to\nconsider production, and not consumption, as the ultimate end and object\nof all industry and commerce.\nIn the restraints upon the importation of all foreign commodities which\ncan come into competition with those of our own growth or manufacture, the\ninterest of the home consumer is evidently sacrificed to that of the\nproducer. It is altogether for the benefit of the latter, that the former\nis obliged to pay that enhancement of price which this monopoly almost\nalways occasions.\nIt is altogether for the benefit of the producer, that bounties are\ngranted upon the exportation of some of his productions. The home consumer\nis obliged to pay, first the tax which is necessary for paying the bounty;\nand, secondly, the still greater tax which necessarily arises from the\nenhancement of the price of the commodity in the home market.\nBy the famous treaty of commerce with Portugal, the consumer is prevented\nby duties from purchasing of a neighbouring country, a commodity which our\nown climate does not produce; but is obliged to purchase it of a distant\ncountry, though it is acknowledged, that the commodity of the distant\ncountry is of a worse quality than that of the near one. The home consumer\nis obliged to submit to this inconvenience, in order that the producer may\nimport into the distant country some of his productions, upon more\nadvantageous terms than he otherwise would have been allowed to do. The\nconsumer, too, is obliged to pay whatever enhancement in the price of\nthose very productions this forced exportation may occasion in the home\nmarket.\nBut in the system of laws which has been established for the management of\nour American and West Indian colonies, the interest of the home consumer\nhas been sacrificed to that of the producer, with a more extravagant\nprofusion than in all our other commercial regulations. A great empire has\nbeen established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers,\nwho should be obliged to buy, from the shops of our different producers,\nall the goods with which these could supply them. For the sake of that\nlittle enhancement of price which this monopoly might afford our\nproducers, the home consumers have been burdened with the whole expense of\nmaintaining and defending that empire. For this purpose, and for this\npurpose only, in the two last wars, more than two hundred millions have\nbeen spent, and a new debt of more than a hundred and seventy millions has\nbeen contracted, over and above all that had been expended for the same\npurpose in former wars. The interest of this debt alone is not only\ngreater than the whole extraordinary profit which, it never could be\npretended, was made by the monopoly of the colony trade, but than the\nwhole value of that trade, or than the whole value of the goods which, at\nan average, have been annually exported to the colonies.\nIt cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of\nthis whole mercantile system; not the consumers, we may believe, whose\ninterest has been entirely neglected; but the producers, whose interest\nhas been so carefully attended to; and among this latter class, our\nmerchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects. In\nthe mercantile regulations which have been taken notice of in this\nchapter, the interest of our manufacturers has been most peculiarly\nattended to; and the interest, not so much of the consumers, as that of\nsome other sets of producers, has been sacrificed to it.\nCHAPTER IX.\nOF THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS, OR OF\nTHOSE SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WHICH REPRESENT THE PRODUCE OF LAND, AS\nEITHER THE SOLE OR THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF THE REVENUE AND WEALTH OF EVERY\nCOUNTRY.\nThe agricultural systems of political economy will not require so long an\nexplanation as that which I have thought it necessary to bestow upon the\nmercantile or commercial system.\nThat system which represents the produce of land as the sole source of the\nrevenue and wealth of every country, has so far as I know, never been\nadopted by any nation, and it at present exists only in the speculations\nof a few men of great learning and ingenuity in France. It would not,\nsurely, be worth while to examine at great length the errors of a system\nwhich never has done, and probably never will do, any harm in any part of\nthe world. I shall endeavour to explain, however, as distinctly as I can,\nthe great outlines of this very ingenious system.\nMr Colbert, the famous minister of Lewis XIV. was a man of probity, of\ngreat industry, and knowledge of detail; of great experience and acuteness\nin the examination of public accounts; and of abilities, in short, every\nway fitted for introducing method and good order into the collection and\nexpenditure of the public revenue. That minister had unfortunately\nembraced all the prejudices of the mercantile system, in its nature and\nessence a system of restraint and regulation, and such as could scarce\nfail to be agreeable to a laborious and plodding man of business, who had\nbeen accustomed to regulate the different departments of public offices,\nand to establish the necessary checks and controls for confining each to\nits proper sphere. The industry and commerce of a great country, he\nendeavoured to regulate upon the same model as the departments of a public\noffice; and instead of allowing every man to pursue his own interest his\nown way, upon the liberal plan of equality, liberty, and justice, he\nbestowed upon certain branches of industry extraordinary privileges, while\nhe laid others under as extraordinary restraints. He was not only\ndisposed, like other European ministers, to encourage more the industry of\nthe towns than that of the country; but, in order to support the industry\nof the towns, he was willing even to depress and keep down that of the\ncountry. In order to render provisions cheap to the inhabitants of the\ntowns, and thereby to encourage manufactures and foreign commerce, he\nprohibited altogether the exportation of corn, and thus excluded the\ninhabitants of the country from every foreign market, for by far the most\nimportant part of the produce of their industry. This prohibition, joined\nto the restraints imposed by the ancient provincial laws of France upon\nthe transportation of corn from one province to another, and to the\narbitrary and degrading taxes which are levied upon the cultivators in\nalmost all the provinces, discouraged and kept down the agriculture of\nthat country very much below the state to which it would naturally have\nrisen in so very fertile a soil, and so very happy a climate. This state\nof discouragement and depression was felt more or less in every different\npart of the country, and many different inquiries were set on foot\nconcerning the causes of it. One of those causes appeared to be the\npreference given, by the institutions of Mr Colbert, to the industry of\nthe towns above that of the country.\nIf the rod be bent too much one way, says the proverb, in order to make it\nstraight, you must bend it as much the other. The French philosophers, who\nhave proposed the system which represents agriculture as the sole source\nof the revenue and wealth of every country, seem to have adopted this\nproverbial maxim; and, as in the plan of Mr Colbert, the industry of the\ntowns was certainly overvalued in comparison with that of the country, so\nin their system it seems to be as certainly under-valued.\nThe different orders of people, who have ever been supposed to contribute\nin any respect towards the annual produce of the land and labour of the\ncountry, they divide into three classes. The first is the class of the\nproprietors of land. The second is the class of the cultivators, of\nfarmers and country labourers, whom they honour with the peculiar\nappellation of the productive class. The third is the class of artificers,\nmanufacturers, and merchants, whom they endeavour to degrade by the\nhumiliating appellation of the barren or unproductive class.\nThe class of proprietors contributes to the annual produce, by the expense\nwhich they may occasionally lay out upon the improvement of the land, upon\nthe buildings, drains, inclosures, and other ameliorations, which they may\neither make or maintain upon it, and by means of which the cultivators are\nenabled, with the same capital, to raise a greater produce, and\nconsequently to pay a greater rent. This advanced rent may be considered\nas the interest or profit due to the proprietor, upon the expense or\ncapital which he thus employs in the improvement of his land. Such\nexpenses are in this system called ground expenses (depenses foncieres).\nThe cultivators or farmers contribute to the annual produce, by what are\nin this system called the original and annual expenses (depenses\nprimitives, et depenses annuelles), which they lay out upon the\ncultivation of the land. The original expenses consist in the instruments\nof husbandry, in the stock of cattle, in the seed, and in the maintenance\nof the farmer\u2019s family, servants, and cattle, during at least a great part\nof the first year of his occupancy, or till he can receive some return\nfrom the land. The annual expenses consist in the seed, in the wear and\ntear of instruments of husbandry, and in the annual maintenance of the\nfarmer\u2019s servants and cattle, and of his family too, so far as any part of\nthem can be considered as servants employed in cultivation. That part of\nthe produce of the land which remains to him after paying the rent, ought\nto be sufficient, first, to replace to him, within a reasonable time, at\nleast during the term of his occupancy, the whole of his original\nexpenses, together with the ordinary profits of stock; and, secondly, to\nreplace to him annually the whole of his annual expenses, together\nlikewise with the ordinary profits of stock. Those two sorts of expenses\nare two capitals which the farmer employs in cultivation; and unless they\nare regularly restored to him, together with a reasonable profit, he\ncannot carry on his employment upon a level with other employments; but,\nfrom a regard to his own interest, must desert it as soon as possible, and\nseek some other. That part of the produce of the land which is thus\nnecessary for enabling the farmer to continue his business, ought to be\nconsidered as a fund sacred to cultivation, which, if the landlord\nviolates, he necessarily reduces the produce of his own land, and, in a\nfew years, not only disables the farmer from paying this racked rent, but\nfrom paying the reasonable rent which he might otherwise have got for his\nland. The rent which properly belongs to the landlord, is no more than the\nneat produce which remains after paying, in the completest manner, all the\nnecessary expenses which must be previously laid out, in order to raise\nthe gross or the whole produce. It is because the labour of the\ncultivators, over and above paying completely all those necessary\nexpenses, affords a neat produce of this kind, that this class of people\nare in this system peculiarly distinguished by the honourable appellation\nof the productive class. Their original and annual expenses are for the\nsame reason called, In this system, productive expenses, because, over and\nabove replacing their own value, they occasion the annual reproduction of\nthis neat produce.\nThe ground expenses, as they are called, or what the landlord lays out\nupon the improvement of his land, are, in this system, too, honoured with\nthe appellation of productive expenses. Till the whole of those expenses,\ntogether with the ordinary profits of stock, have been completely repaid\nto him by the advanced rent which he gets from his land, that advanced\nrent ought to be regarded as sacred and inviolable, both by the church and\nby the king; ought to be subject neither to tithe nor to taxation. If it\nis otherwise, by discouraging the improvement of land, the church\ndiscourages the future increase of her own tithes, and the king the future\nincrease of his own taxes. As in a well ordered state of things,\ntherefore, those ground expenses, over and above reproducing in the\ncompletest manner their own value, occasion likewise, after a certain\ntime, a reproduction of a neat produce, they are in this system considered\nas productive expenses.\nThe ground expenses of the landlord, however, together with the original\nand the annual expenses of the farmer, are the only three sorts of\nexpenses which in this system are considered as productive. All other\nexpenses, and all other orders of people, even those who, in the common\napprehensions of men, are regarded as the most productive, are, in this\naccount of things, represented as altogether barren and unproductive.\nArtificers and manufacturers, in particular, whose industry, in the common\napprehensions of men, increases so much the value of the rude produce of\nland, are in this system represented as a class of people altogether\nbarren and unproductive. Their labour, it is said, replaces only the stock\nwhich employs them, together with its ordinary profits. That stock\nconsists in the materials, tools, and wages, advanced to them by their\nemployer; and is the fund destined for their employment and maintenance.\nIts profits are the fund destined for the maintenance of their employer.\nTheir employer, as he advances to them the stock of materials, tools, and\nwages, necessary for their employment, so he advances to himself what is\nnecessary for his own maintenance; and this maintenance he generally\nproportions to the profit which he expects to make by the price of their\nwork. Unless its price repays to him the maintenance which he advances to\nhimself, as well as the materials, tools, and wages, which he advances to\nhis workmen, it evidently does not repay to him the whole expense which he\nlays out upon it. The profits of manufacturing stock, therefore, are not,\nlike the rent of land, a neat produce which remains after completely\nrepaying the whole expense which must be laid out in order to obtain them.\nThe stock of the farmer yields him a profit, as well as that of the master\nmanufacturer; and it yields a rent likewise to another person, which that\nof the master manufacturer does not. The expense, therefore, laid out in\nemploying and maintaining artificers and manufacturers, does no more than\ncontinue, if one may say so, the existence of its own value, and does not\nproduce any new value. It is, therefore, altogether a barren and\nunproductive expense. The expense, on the contrary, laid out in employing\nfarmers and country labourers, over and above continuing the existence of\nits own value, produces a new value the rent of the landlord. It is,\ntherefore, a productive expense.\nMercantile stock is equally barren and unproductive with manufacturing\nstock. It only continues the existence of its own value, without producing\nany new value. Its profits are only the repayment of the maintenance which\nits employer advances to himself during the time that he employs it, or\ntill he receives the returns of it. They are only the repayment of a part\nof the expense which must be laid out in employing it.\nThe labour of artificers and manufacturers never adds any thing to the\nvalue of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land. It adds,\nindeed, greatly to the value of some particular parts of it. But the\nconsumption which, in the mean time, it occasions of other parts, is\nprecisely equal to the value which it adds to those parts; so that the\nvalue of the whole amount is not, at any one moment of time, in the least\naugmented by it. The person who works the lace of a pair of fine ruffles\nfor example, will sometimes raise the value of, perhaps, a pennyworth of\nflax to \u00a330 sterling. But though, at first sight, he appears thereby to\nmultiply the value of a part of the rude produce about seven thousand and\ntwo hundred times, he in reality adds nothing to the value of the whole\nannual amount of the rude produce. The working of that lace costs him,\nperhaps, two years labour. The \u00a330 which he gets for it when it is\nfinished, is no more than the repayment of the subsistence which he\nadvances to himself during the two years that he is employed about it. The\nvalue which, by every day\u2019s, month\u2019s, or year\u2019s labour, he adds to the\nflax, does no more than replace the value of his own consumption during\nthat day, month, or year. At no moment of time, therefore, does he add any\nthing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the\nland: the portion of that produce which he is continually consuming, being\nalways equal to the value which he is continually producing. The extreme\npoverty of the greater part of the persons employed in this expensive,\nthough trifling manufacture, may satisfy us that the price of their work\ndoes not, in ordinary cases, exceed the value of their subsistence. It is\notherwise with the work of farmers and country labourers. The rent of the\nlandlord is a value which, in ordinary cases, it is continually producing\nover and above replacing, in the most complete manner, the whole\nconsumption, the whole expense laid out upon the employment and\nmaintenance both of the workmen and of their employer.\nArtificers, manufacturers, and merchants, can augment the revenue and\nwealth of their society by parsimony only; or, as it is expressed in this\nsystem, by privation, that is, by depriving themselves of a part of the\nfunds destined for their own subsistence. They annually reproduce nothing\nbut those funds. Unless, therefore, they annually save some part of them,\nunless they annually deprive themselves of the enjoyment of some part of\nthem, the revenue and wealth of their society can never be, in the\nsmallest degree, augmented by means of their industry. Farmers and country\nlabourers, on the contrary, may enjoy completely the whole funds destined\nfor their own subsistence, and yet augment, at the same time, the revenue\nand wealth of their society. Over and above what is destined for their own\nsubsistence, their industry annually affords a neat produce, of which the\naugmentation necessarily augments the revenue and wealth of their society.\nNations, therefore, which, like France or England, consist in a great\nmeasure, of proprietors and cultivators, can be enriched by industry and\nenjoyment. Nations, on the contrary, which, like Holland and Hamburgh, are\ncomposed chiefly of merchants, artificers, and manufacturers, can grow\nrich only through parsimony and privation. As the interest of nations so\ndifferently circumstanced is very different, so is likewise the common\ncharacter of the people. In those of the former kind, liberality,\nfrankness, and good fellowship, naturally make a part of their common\ncharacter; in the latter, narrowness, meanness, and a selfish disposition,\naverse to all social pleasure and enjoyment.\nThe unproductive class, that of merchants, artificers, and manufacturers,\nis maintained and employed altogether at the expense of the two other\nclasses, of that of proprietors, and of that of cultivators. They furnish\nit both with the materials of its work, and with the fund of its\nsubsistence, with the corn and cattle which it consumes while it is\nemployed about that work. The proprietors and cultivators finally pay both\nthe wages of all the workmen of the unproductive class, and the profits of\nall their employers. Those workmen and their employers are properly the\nservants of the proprietors and cultivators. They are only servants who\nwork without doors, as menial servants work within. Both the one and the\nother, however, are equally maintained at the expense of the same masters.\nThe labour of both is equally unproductive. It adds nothing to the value\nof the sum total of the rude produce of the land. Instead of increasing\nthe value of that sum total, it is a charge and expense which must be paid\nout of it.\nThe unproductive class, however, is not only useful, but greatly useful,\nto the other two classes. By means of the industry of merchants,\nartificers, and manufacturers, the proprietors and cultivators can\npurchase both the foreign goods and the manufactured produce of their own\ncountry, which they have occasion for, with the produce of a much smaller\nquantity of their own labour, than what they would be obliged to employ,\nif they were to attempt, in an awkward and unskilful manner, either to\nimport the one, or to make the other, for their own use. By means of the\nunproductive class, the cultivators are delivered from many cares, which\nwould otherwise distract their attention from the cultivation of land. The\nsuperiority of produce, which in consequence of this undivided attention,\nthey are enabled to raise, is fully sufficient to pay the whole expense\nwhich the maintenance and employment of the unproductive class costs\neither the proprietors or themselves. The industry of merchants,\nartificers, and manufacturers, though in its own nature altogether\nunproductive, yet contributes in this manner indirectly to increase the\nproduce of the land. It increases the productive powers of productive\nlabour, by leaving it at liberty to confine itself to its proper\nemployment, the cultivation of land; and the plough goes frequently the\neasier and the better, by means of the labour of the man whose business is\nmost remote from the plough.\nIt can never be the interest of the proprietors and cultivators, to\nrestrain or to discourage, in any respect, the industry of merchants,\nartificers, and manufacturers. The greater the liberty which this\nunproductive class enjoys, the greater will be the competition in all the\ndifferent trades which compose it, and the cheaper will the other two\nclasses be supplied, both with foreign goods and with the manufactured\nproduce of their own country.\nIt can never be the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the\nother two classes. It is the surplus produce of the land, or what remains\nafter deducting the maintenance, first of the cultivators, and afterwards\nof the proprietors, that maintains and employs the unproductive class. The\ngreater this surplus, the greater must likewise be the maintenance and\nemployment of that class. The establishment of perfect justice, of perfect\nliberty, and of perfect equality, is the very simple secret which most\neffectually secures the highest degree of prosperity to all the three\nclasses.\nThe merchants, artificers, and manufacturers of those mercantile states,\nwhich, like Holland and Hamburgh, consist chiefly of this unproductive\nclass, are in the same manner maintained and employed altogether at the\nexpense of the proprietors and cultivators of land. The only difference\nis, that those proprietors and cultivators are, the greater part of them,\nplaced at a most inconvenient distance from the merchants, artificers, and\nmanufacturers, whom they supply with the materials of their work and the\nfund of their subsistence; are the inhabitants of other countries, and the\nsubjects of other governments.\nSuch mercantile states, however, are not only useful, but greatly useful,\nto the inhabitants of those other countries. They fill up, in some\nmeasure, a very important void; and supply the place of the merchants,\nartificers, and manufacturers, whom the inhabitants of those countries\nought to find at home, but whom, from some defect in their policy, they do\nnot find at home.\nIt can never be the interest of those landed nations, if I may call them\nso, to discourage or distress the industry of such mercantile states, by\nimposing high duties upon their trade, or upon the commodities which they\nfurnish. Such duties, by rendering those commodities dearer, could serve\nonly to sink the real value of the surplus produce of their own land, with\nwhich, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of which those\ncommodities are purchased. Such duties could only serve to discourage the\nincrease of that surplus produce, and consequently the improvement and\ncultivation of their own land. The most effectual expedient, on the\ncontrary, for raising the value of that surplus produce, for encouraging\nits increase, and consequently the improvement and cultivation of their\nown land, would be to allow the most perfect freedom to the trade of all\nsuch mercantile nations.\nThis perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectual expedient\nfor supplying them, in due time, with all the artificers, manufacturers,\nand merchants, whom they wanted at home; and for filling up, in the\nproperest and most advantageous manner, that very important void which\nthey felt there.\nThe continual increase of the surplus produce of their land would, in due\ntime, create a greater capital than what would be employed with the\nordinary rate of profit in the improvement and cultivation of land; and\nthe surplus part of it would naturally turn itself to the employment of\nartificers and manufacturers, at home. But these artificers and\nmanufacturers, finding at home both the materials of their work and the\nfund of their subsistence, might immediately, even with much less art and\nskill be able to work as cheap as the little artificers and manufacturers\nof such mercantile states, who had both to bring from a greater distance.\nEven though, from want of art and skill, they might not for some time be\nable to work as cheap, yet, finding a market at home, they might be able\nto sell their work there as cheap as that of the artificers and\nmanufacturers of such mercantile states, which could not be brought to\nthat market but from so great a distance; and as their art and skill\nimproved, they would soon be able to sell it cheaper. The artificers and\nmanufacturers of such mercantile states, therefore, would immediately be\nrivalled in the market of those landed nations, and soon after undersold\nand justled out of it altogether. The cheapness of the manufactures of\nthose landed nations, in consequence of the gradual improvements of art\nand skill, would, in due time, extend their sale beyond the home market,\nand carry them to many foreign markets, from which they would, in the same\nmanner, gradually justle out many of the manufacturers of such mercantile\nnations.\nThis continual increase, both of the rude and manufactured produce of\nthose landed nations, would, in due time, create a greater capital than\ncould, with the ordinary rate of profit, be employed either in agriculture\nor in manufactures. The surplus of this capital would naturally turn\nitself to foreign trade and be employed in exporting, to foreign\ncountries, such parts of the rude and manufactured produce of its own\ncountry, as exceeded the demand of the home market. In the exportation of\nthe produce of their own country, the merchants of a landed nation would\nhave an advantage of the same kind over those of mercantile nations, which\nits artificers and manufacturers had over the artificers and manufacturers\nof such nations; the advantage of finding at home that cargo, and those\nstores and provisions, which the others were obliged to seek for at a\ndistance. With inferior art and skill in navigation, therefore, they would\nbe able to sell that cargo as cheap in foreign markets as the merchants of\nsuch mercantile nations; and with equal art and skill they would be able\nto sell it cheaper. They would soon, therefore, rival those mercantile\nnations in this branch of foreign trade, and, in due time, would justle\nthem out of it altogether.\nAccording to this liberal and generous system, therefore, the most\nadvantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers,\nmanufacturers, and merchants of its own, is to grant the most perfect\nfreedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of all\nother nations. It thereby raises the value of the surplus produce of its\nown land, of which the continual increase gradually establishes a fund,\nwhich, in due time, necessarily raises up all the artificers,\nmanufacturers, and merchants, whom it has occasion for.\nWhen a landed nation on the contrary, oppresses, either by high duties or\nby prohibitions, the trade of foreign nations, it necessarily hurts its\nown interest in two different ways. First, by raising the price of all\nforeign goods, and of all sorts of manufactures, it necessarily sinks the\nreal value of the surplus produce of its own land, with which, or, what\ncomes to the same thing, with the price of which, it purchases those\nforeign goods and manufactures. Secondly, by giving a sort of monopoly of\nthe home market to its own merchants, artificers, and manufacturers, it\nraises the rate of mercantile and manufacturing profit, in proportion to\nthat of agricultural profit; and, consequently, either draws from\nagriculture a part of the capital which had before been employed in it, or\nhinders from going to it a part of what would otherwise have gone to it.\nThis policy, therefore, discourages agriculture in two different ways;\nfirst, by sinking the real value of its produce, and thereby lowering the\nrate of its profits; and, secondly, by raising the rate of profit in all\nother employments. Agriculture is rendered less advantageous, and trade\nand manufactures more advantageous, than they otherwise would be; and\nevery man is tempted by his own interest to turn, as much as he can, both\nhis capital and his industry from the former to the latter employments.\nThough, by this oppressive policy, a landed nation should be able to raise\nup artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of its own, somewhat sooner\nthan it could do by the freedom of trade; a matter, however, which is not\na little doubtful; yet it would raise them up, if one may say so,\nprematurely, and before it was perfectly ripe for them. By raising up too\nhastily one species of industry, it would depress another more valuable\nspecies of industry. By raising up too hastily a species of industry which\nduly replaces the stock which employs it, together with the ordinary\nprofit, it would depress a species of industry which, over and above\nreplacing that stock, with its profit, affords likewise a neat produce, a\nfree rent to the landlord. It would depress productive labour, by\nencouraging too hastily that labour which is altogether barren and\nunproductive.\nIn what manner, according to this system, the sum total of the annual\nproduce of the land is distributed among the three classes above\nmentioned, and in what manner the labour of the unproductive class does no\nmore than replace the value of its own consumption, without increasing in\nany respect the value of that sum total, is represented by Mr Quesnai, the\nvery ingenious and profound author of this system, in some arithmetical\nformularies. The first of these formularies, which, by way of eminence, he\npeculiarly distinguishes by the name of the Economical Table, represents\nthe manner in which he supposes this distribution takes place, in a state\nof the most perfect liberty, and, therefore, of the highest prosperity; in\na state where the annual produce is such as to afford the greatest\npossible neat produce, and where each class enjoys its proper share of the\nwhole annual produce. Some subsequent formularies represent the manner in\nwhich he supposes this distribution is made in different states of\nrestraint and regulation; in which, either the class of proprietors, or\nthe barren and unproductive class, is more favoured than the class of\ncultivators; and in which either the one or the other encroaches, more or\nless, upon the share which ought properly to belong to this productive\nclass. Every such encroachment, every violation of that natural\ndistribution, which the most perfect liberty would establish, must,\naccording to this system, necessarily degrade, more or less, from one year\nto another, the value and sum total of the annual produce, and must\nnecessarily occasion a gradual declension in the real wealth and revenue\nof the society; a declension, of which the progress must be quicker or\nslower, according to the degree of this encroachment, according as that\nnatural distribution, which the most perfect liberty would establish, is\nmore or less violated. Those subsequent formularies represent the\ndifferent degrees of declension which, according to this system,\ncorrespond to the different degrees in which this natural distribution of\nthings is violated.\nSome speculative physicians seem to have imagined that the health of the\nhuman body could be preserved only by a certain precise regimen of diet\nand exercise, of which every, the smallest violation, necessarily\noccasioned some degree of disease or disorder proportionate to the degree\nof the violation. Experience, however, would seem to shew, that the human\nbody frequently preserves, to all appearance at least, the most perfect\nstate of health under a vast variety of different regimens; even under\nsome which are generally believed to be very far from being perfectly\nwholesome. But the healthful state of the human body, it would seem,\ncontains in itself some unknown principle of preservation, capable either\nof preventing or of correcting, in many respects, the bad effects even of\na very faulty regimen. Mr Quesnai, who was himself a physician, and a very\nspeculative physician, seems to have entertained a notion of the same kind\nconcerning the political body, and to have imagined that it would thrive\nand prosper only under a certain precise regimen, the exact regimen of\nperfect liberty and perfect justice. He seems not to have considered, that\nin the political body, the natural effort which every man is continually\nmaking to better his own condition, is a principle of preservation capable\nof preventing and correcting, in many respects, the bad effects of a\npolitical economy, in some degree both partial and oppressive. Such a\npolitical economy, though it no doubt retards more or less, is not always\ncapable of stopping altogether, the natural progress of a nation towards\nwealth and prosperity, and still less of making it go backwards. If a\nnation could not prosper without the enjoyment of perfect liberty and\nperfect justice, there is not in the world a nation which could ever have\nprospered. In the political body, however, the wisdom of nature has\nfortunately made ample provision for remedying many of the bad effects of\nthe folly and injustice of man; it the same manner as it has done in the\nnatural body, for remedying those of his sloth and intemperance.\nThe capital error of this system, however, seems to lie in its\nrepresenting the class of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, as\naltogether barren and unproductive. The following observations may serve\nto shew the impropriety of this representation:\u2014\nFirst, this class, it is acknowledged, reproduces annually the value of\nits own annual consumption, and continues, at least, the existence of the\nstock or capital which maintains and employs it. But, upon this account\nalone, the denomination of barren or unproductive should seem to be very\nimproperly applied to it. We should not call a marriage barren or\nunproductive, though it produced only a son and a daughter, to replace the\nfather and mother, and though it did not increase the number of the human\nspecies, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and country\nlabourers, indeed, over and above the stock which maintains and employs\nthem, reproduce annually a neat produce, a free rent to the landlord. As a\nmarriage which affords three children is certainly more productive than\none which affords only two, so the labour of farmers and country labourers\nis certainly more productive than that of merchants, artificers, and\nmanufacturers. The superior produce of the one class, however, does not,\nrender the other barren or unproductive.\nSecondly, it seems, on this account, altogether improper to consider\nartificers, manufacturers, and merchants, in the same light as menial\nservants. The labour of menial servants does not continue the existence of\nthe fund which maintains and employs them. Their maintenance and\nemployment is altogether at the expense of their masters, and the work\nwhich they perform is not of a nature to repay that expense. That work\nconsists in services which perish generally in the very instant of their\nperformance, and does not fix or realize itself in any vendible commodity,\nwhich can replace the value of their wages and maintenance. The labour, on\nthe contrary, of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, naturally does\nfix and realize itself in some such vendible commodity. It is upon this\naccount that, in the chapter in which I treat of productive and\nunproductive labour, I have classed artificers, manufacturers, and\nmerchants among the productive labourers, and menial servants among the\nbarren or unproductive.\nThirdly, it seems, upon every supposition, improper to say, that the\nlabour of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, does not increase the\nreal revenue of the society. Though we should suppose, for example, as it\nseems to be supposed in this system, that the value of the daily, monthly,\nand yearly consumption of this class was exactly equal to that of its\ndaily, monthly, and yearly production; yet it would not from thence\nfollow, that its labour added nothing to the real revenue, to the real\nvalue of the annual produce of the land and labour of the society. An\nartificer, for example, who, in the first six months after harvest,\nexecutes ten pounds worth of work, though he should, in the same time,\nconsume ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries, yet really adds\nthe value of ten pounds to the annual produce of the land and labour of\nthe society. While he has been consuming a half-yearly revenue of ten\npounds worth of corn and other necessaries, he has produced an equal value\nof work, capable of purchasing, either to himself, or to some other\nperson, an equal half-yearly revenue. The value, therefore, of what has\nbeen consumed and produced during these six months, is equal, not to ten,\nbut to twenty pounds. It is possible, indeed, that no more than ten pounds\nworth of this value may ever have existed at any one moment of time. But\nif the ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries which were consumed\nby the artificer, had been consumed by a soldier, or by a menial servant,\nthe value of that part of the annual produce which existed at the end of\nthe six months, would have been ten pounds less than it actually is in\nconsequence of the labour of the artificer. Though the value of what the\nartificer produces, therefore, should not, at any one moment of time, be\nsupposed greater than the value he consumes, yet, at every moment of time,\nthe actually existing value of goods in the market is, in consequence of\nwhat he produces, greater than it otherwise would be.\nWhen the patrons of this system assert, that the consumption of\nartificers, manufacturers, and merchants, is equal to the value of what\nthey produce, they probably mean no more than that their revenue, or the\nfund destined for their consumption, is equal to it. But if they had\nexpressed themselves more accurately, and only asserted, that the revenue\nof this class was equal to the value of what they produced, it might\nreadily have occurred to the reader, that what would naturally be saved\nout of this revenue, must necessarily increase more or less the real\nwealth of the society. In order, therefore, to make out something like an\nargument, it was necessary that they should express themselves as they\nhave done; and this argument, even supposing things actually were as it\nseems to presume them to be, turns out to be a very inconclusive one.\nFourthly, farmers and country labourers can no more augment, without\nparsimony, the real revenue, the annual produce of the land and labour of\ntheir society, than artificers, manufacturers, and merchants. The annual\nproduce of the land and labour of any society can be augmented only in two\nways; either, first, by some improvement in the productive powers of the\nuseful labour actually maintained within it; or, secondly, by some\nincrease in the quantity of that labour.\nThe improvement in the productive powers of useful labour depends, first,\nupon the improvement in the ability of the workman; and, secondly, upon\nthat of the machinery with which he works. But the labour of artificers\nand manufacturers, as it is capable of being more subdivided, and the\nlabour of each workman reduced to a greater simplicity of operation, than\nthat of farmers and country labourers; so it is likewise capable of both\nthese sorts of improvement in a much higher degree {See book i chap. 1.}\nIn this respect, therefore, the class of cultivators can have no sort of\nadvantage over that of artificers and manufacturers.\nThe increase in the quantity of useful labour actually employed within any\nsociety must depend altogether upon the increase of the capital which\nemploys it; and the increase of that capital, again, must be exactly equal\nto the amount of the savings from the revenue, either of the particular\npersons who manage and direct the employment of that capital, or of some\nother persons, who lend it to them. If merchants, artificers, and\nmanufacturers are, as this system seems to suppose, naturally more\ninclined to parsimony and saving than proprietors and cultivators, they\nare, so far, more likely to augment the quantity of useful labour employed\nwithin their society, and consequently to increase its real revenue, the\nannual produce of its land and labour.\nFifthly and lastly, though the revenue of the inhabitants of every country\nwas supposed to consist altogether, as this system seems to suppose, in\nthe quantity of subsistence which their industry could procure to them;\nyet, even upon this supposition, the revenue of a trading and\nmanufacturing country must, other things being equal, always be much\ngreater than that of one without trade or manufactures. By means of trade\nand manufactures, a greater quantity of subsistence can be annually\nimported into a particular country, than what its own lands, in the actual\nstate of their cultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of a town,\nthough they frequently possess no lands of their own, yet draw to\nthemselves, by their industry, such a quantity of the rude produce of the\nlands of other people, as supplies them, not only with the materials of\ntheir work, but with the fund of their subsistence. What a town always is\nwith regard to the country in its neighbourhood, one independent state or\ncountry may frequently be with regard to other independent states or\ncountries. It is thus that Holland draws a great part of its subsistence\nfrom other countries; live cattle from Holstein and Jutland, and corn from\nalmost all the different countries of Europe. A small quantity of\nmanufactured produce, purchases a great quantity of rude produce. A\ntrading and manufacturing country, therefore, naturally purchases, with a\nsmall part of its manufactured produce, a great part of the rude produce\nof other countries; while, on the contrary, a country without trade and\nmanufactures is generally obliged to purchase, at the expense of a great\npart of its rude produce, a very small part of the manufactured produce of\nother countries. The one exports what can subsist and accommodate but a\nvery few, and imports the subsistence and accommodation of a great number.\nThe other exports the accommodation and subsistence of a great number, and\nimports that of a very few only. The inhabitants of the one must always\nenjoy a much greater quantity of subsistence than what their own lands, in\nthe actual state of their cultivation, could afford. The inhabitants of\nthe other must always enjoy a much smaller quantity.\nThis system, however, with all its imperfections, is perhaps the nearest\napproximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of\npolitical economy; and is upon that account, well worth the consideration\nof every man who wishes to examine with attention the principles of that\nvery important science. Though in representing the labour which is\nemployed upon land as the only productive labour, the notions which it\ninculcates are, perhaps, too narrow and confined; yet in representing the\nwealth of nations as consisting, not in the unconsumable riches of money,\nbut in the consumable goods annually reproduced by the labour of the\nsociety, and in representing perfect liberty as the only effectual\nexpedient for rendering this annual reproduction the greatest possible,\nits doctrine seems to be in every respect as just as it is generous and\nliberal. Its followers are very numerous; and as men are fond of\nparadoxes, and of appearing to understand what surpasses the\ncomprehensions of ordinary people, the paradox which it maintains,\nconcerning the unproductive nature of manufacturing labour, has not,\nperhaps, contributed a little to increase the number of its admirers. They\nhave for some years past made a pretty considerable sect, distinguished in\nthe French republic of letters by the name of the Economists. Their works\nhave certainly been of some service to their country; not only by bringing\ninto general discussion, many subjects which had never been well examined\nbefore, but by influencing, in some measure, the public administration in\nfavour of agriculture. It has been in consequence of their\nrepresentations, accordingly, that the agriculture of France has been\ndelivered from several of the oppressions which it before laboured under.\nThe term, during which such a lease can be granted, as will be valid\nagainst every future purchaser or proprietor of the land, has been\nprolonged from nine to twenty-seven years. The ancient provincial\nrestraints upon the transportation of corn from one province of the\nkingdom to another, have been entirely taken away; and the liberty of\nexporting it to all foreign countries, has been established as the common\nlaw of the kingdom in all ordinary cases. This sect, in their works, which\nare very numerous, and which treat not only of what is properly called\nPolitical Economy, or of the nature and causes or the wealth of nations,\nbut of every other branch of the system of civil government, all follow\nimplicitly, and without any sensible variation, the doctrine of Mr\nQttesnai. There is, upon this account, little variety in the greater part\nof their works. The most distinct and best connected account of this\ndoctrine is to be found in a little book written by Mr Mercier de la\nRiviere, some time intendant of Martinico, entitled, The natural and\nessential Order of Political Societies. The admiration of this whole sect\nfor their master, who was himself a man of the greatest modesty and\nsimplicity, is not inferior to that of any of the ancient philosophers for\nthe founders of their respective systems. \u2018There have been since the world\nbegan,\u2019 says a very diligent and respectable author, the Marquis de\nMirabeau, \u2018three great inventions which have principally given stability\nto political societies, independent of many other inventions which have\nenriched and adorned them. The first is the invention of writing, which\nalone gives human nature the power of transmitting, without alteration,\nits laws, its contracts, its annals, and its discoveries. The second is\nthe invention of money, which binds together all the relations between\ncivilized societies. The third is the economical table, the result of the\nother two, which completes them both by perfecting their object; the great\ndiscovery of our age, but of which our posterity will reap the benefit.\u2019\nAs the political economy of the nations of modern Europe has been more\nfavourable to manufactures and foreign trade, the industry of the towns,\nthan to agriculture, the industry of the country; so that of other nations\nhas followed a different plan, and has been more favourable to agriculture\nthan to manufactures and foreign trade.\nThe policy of China favours agriculture more than all other employments.\nIn China, the condition of a labourer is said to be as much superior to\nthat of an artificer, as in most parts of Europe that of an artificer is\nto that of a labourer. In China, the great ambition of every man is to get\npossession of a little bit of land, either in property or in lease; and\nleases are there said to be granted upon very moderate terms, and to be\nsufficiently secured to the lessees. The Chinese have little respect for\nforeign trade. Your beggarly commerce! was the language in which the\nmandarins of Pekin used to talk to Mr De Lange, the Russian envoy,\nconcerning it {See the Journal of Mr De Lange, in Bell\u2019s Travels, vol.\nii. p. 258, 276, 293.}. Except with Japan, the Chinese carry on,\nthemselves, and in their own bottoms, little or no foreign trade; and it\nis only into one or two ports of their kingdom that they even admit the\nships of foreign nations. Foreign trade, therefore, is, in China, every\nway confined within a much narrower circle than that to which it would\nnaturally extend itself, if more freedom was allowed to it, either in\ntheir own ships, or in those of foreign nations.\nManufactures, as in a small bulk they frequently contain a great value,\nand can upon that account be transported at less expense from one country\nto another than most parts of rude produce, are, in almost all countries,\nthe principal support of foreign trade. In countries, besides, less\nextensive, and less favourably circumstanced for inferior commerce than\nChina, they generally require the support of foreign trade. Without an\nextensive foreign market, they could not well flourish, either in\ncountries so moderately extensive as to afford but a narrow home market,\nor in countries where the communication between one province and another\nwas so difficult, as to render it impossible for the goods of any\nparticular place to enjoy the whole of that home market which the country\ncould afford. The perfection of manufacturing industry, it must be\nremembered, depends altogether upon the division of labour; and the degree\nto which the division of labour can be introduced into any manufacture, is\nnecessarily regulated, it has already been shewn, by the extent of the\nmarket. But the great extent of the empire of China, the vast multitude of\nits inhabitants, the variety of climate, and consequently of productions\nin its different provinces, and the easy communication by means of\nwater-carriage between the greater part of them, render the home market of\nthat country of so great extent, as to be alone sufficient to support very\ngreat manufactures, and to admit of very considerable subdivisions of\nlabour. The home market of China is, perhaps, in extent, not much inferior\nto the market of all the different countries of Europe put together. A\nmore extensive foreign trade, however, which to this great home market\nadded the foreign market of all the rest of the world, especially if any\nconsiderable part of this trade was carried on in Chinese ships, could\nscarce fail to increase very much the manufactures of China, and to\nimprove very much the productive powers of its manufacturing industry. By\na more extensive navigation, the Chinese would naturally learn the art of\nusing and constructing, themselves, all the different machines made use of\nin other countries, as well as the other improvements of art and industry\nwhich are practised in all the different parts of the world. Upon their\npresent plan, they have little opportunity of improving themselves by the\nexample of any other nation, except that of the Japanese.\nThe policy of ancient Egypt, too, and that of the Gentoo government of\nIndostan, seem to have favoured agriculture more than all other\nemployments.\nBoth in ancient Egypt and Indostan, the whole body of the people was\ndivided into different casts or tribes each of which was confined, from\nfather to son, to a particular employment, or class of employments. The\nson of a priest was necessarily a priest; the son of a soldier, a soldier;\nthe son of a labourer, a labourer; the son of a weaver, a weaver; the son\nof a tailor, a tailor, etc. In both countries, the cast of the priests\nholds the highest rank, and that of the soldiers the next; and in both\ncountries the cast of the farmers and labourers was superior to the casts\nof merchants and manufacturers.\nThe government of both countries was particularly attentive to the\ninterest of agriculture. The works constructed by the ancient sovereigns\nof Egypt, for the proper distribution of the waters of the Nile, were\nfamous in antiquity, and the ruined remains of some of them are still the\nadmiration of travellers. Those of the same kind which were constructed by\nthe ancient sovereigns of Indostan, for the proper distribution of the\nwaters of the Ganges, as well as of many other rivers, though they have\nbeen less celebrated, seem to have been equally great. Both countries,\naccordingly, though subject occasionally to dearths, have been famous for\ntheir great fertility. Though both were extremely populous, yet, in years\nof moderate plenty, they were both able to export great quantities of\ngrain to their neighbours.\nThe ancient Egyptians had a superstitious aversion to the sea; and as the\nGentoo religion does not permit its followers to light a fire, nor\nconsequently to dress any victuals, upon the water, it, in effect,\nprohibits them from all distant sea voyages. Both the Egyptians and\nIndians must have depended almost altogether upon the navigation of other\nnations for the exportation of their surplus produce; and this dependency,\nas it must have confined the market, so it must have discouraged the\nincrease of this surplus produce. It must have discouraged, too, the\nincrease of the manufactured produce, more than that of the rude produce.\nManufactures require a much more extensive market than the most important\nparts of the rude produce of the land. A single shoemaker will make more\nthan 300 pairs of shoes in the year; and his own family will not, perhaps,\nwear out six pairs. Unless, therefore, he has the custom of, at least, 50\nsuch families as his own, he cannot dispose of the whole product of his\nown labour. The most numerous class of artificers will seldom, in a large\ncountry, make more than one in 50, or one in a 100, of the whole number of\nfamilies contained in it. But in such large countries, as France and\nEngland, the number of people employed in agriculture has, by some authors\nbeen computed at a half, by others at a third and by no author that I know\nof, at less that a fifth of the whole inhabitants of the country. But as\nthe produce of the agriculture of both France and England is, the far\ngreater part of it, consumed at home, each person employed in it must,\naccording to these computations, require little more than the custom of\none, two, or, at most, of four such families as his own, in order to\ndispose of the whole produce of his own labour. Agriculture, therefore,\ncan support itself under the discouragement of a confined market much\nbetter than manufactures. In both ancient Egypt and Indostan, indeed, the\nconfinement of the foreign market was in some measure compensated by the\nconveniency of many inland navigations, which opened, in the most\nadvantageous manner, the whole extent of the home market to every part of\nthe produce of every different district of those countries. The great\nextent of Indostan, too, rendered the home market of that country very\ngreat, and sufficient to support a great variety of manufactures. But the\nsmall extent of ancient Egypt, which was never equal to England, must at\nall times, have rendered the home market of that country too narrow for\nsupporting any great variety of manufactures. Bengal accordingly, the\nprovince of Indostan which commonly exports the greatest quantity of rice,\nhas always been more remarkable for the exportation of a great variety of\nmanufactures, than for that of its grain. Ancient Egypt, on the contrary,\nthough it exported some manufactures, fine linen in particular, as well as\nsome other goods, was always most distinguished for its great exportation\nof grain. It was long the granary of the Roman empire.\nThe sovereigns of China, of ancient Egypt, and of the different kingdoms\ninto which Indostan has, at different times, been divided, have always\nderived the whole, or by far the most considerable part, of their revenue,\nfrom some sort of land tax or land rent. This land tax, or land rent, like\nthe tithe in Europe, consisted in a certain proportion, a fifth, it is\nsaid, of the produce of the land, which was either delivered in kind, or\npaid in money, according to a certain valuation, and which, therefore,\nvaried from year to year, according to all the variations of the produce.\nIt was natural, therefore, that the sovereigns of those countries should\nbe particularly attentive to the interests of agriculture, upon the\nprosperity or declension of which immediately depended the yearly increase\nor diminution of their own revenue.\nThe policy of the ancient republics of Greece, and that of Rome, though it\nhonoured agriculture more than manufactures or foreign trade, yet seems\nrather to have discouraged the latter employments, than to have given any\ndirect or intentional encouragement to the former. In several of the\nancient states of Greece, foreign trade was prohibited altogether; and in\nseveral others, the employments of artificers and manufacturers were\nconsidered as hurtful to the strength and agility of the human body, as\nrendering it incapable of those habits which their military and gymnastic\nexercises endeavoured to form in it, and as thereby disqualifying it, more\nor less, for undergoing the fatigues and encountering the dangers of war.\nSuch occupations were considered as fit only for slaves, and the free\ncitizens of the states were prohibited from exercising them. Even in those\nstates where no such prohibition took place, as in Rome and Athens, the\ngreat body of the people were in effect excluded from all the trades which\nare now commonly exercised by the lower sort of the inhabitants of towns.\nSuch trades were, at Athens and Rome, all occupied by the slaves of the\nrich, who exercised them for the benefit of their masters, whose wealth,\npower, and protection, made it almost impossible for a poor freeman to\nfind a market for his work, when it came into competition with that of the\nslaves of the rich. Slaves, however, are very seldom inventive; and all\nthe most important improvements, either in machinery, or in the\narrangement and distribution of work, which facilitate and abridge labour\nhave been the discoveries of freemen. Should a slave propose any\nimprovement of this kind, his master would be very apt to consider the\nproposal as the suggestion of laziness, and of a desire to save his own\nlabour at the master\u2019s expense. The poor slave, instead of reward would\nprobably meet with much abuse, perhaps with some punishment. In the\nmanufactures carried on by slaves, therefore, more labour must generally\nhave been employed to execute the same quantity of work, than in those\ncarried on by freemen. The work of the farmer must, upon that account,\ngenerally have been dearer than that of the latter. The Hungarian mines,\nit is remarked by Mr Montesquieu, though not richer, have always been\nwrought with less expense, and therefore with more profit, than the\nTurkish mines in their neighbourhood. The Turkish mines are wrought by\nslaves; and the arms of those slaves are the only machines which the Turks\nhave ever thought of employing. The Hungarian mines are wrought by\nfreemen, who employ a great deal of machinery, by which they facilitate\nand abridge their own labour. From the very little that is known about the\nprice of manufactures in the times of the Greeks and Romans, it would\nappear that those of the finer sort were excessively dear. Silk sold for\nits weight in gold. It was not, indeed, in those times an European\nmanufacture; and as it was all brought from the East Indies, the distance\nof the carriage may in some measure account for the greatness of the\nprice. The price, however, which a lady, it is said, would sometimes pay\nfor a piece of very fine linen, seems to have been equally extravagant;\nand as linen was always either an European, or at farthest, an Egyptian\nmanufacture, this high price can be accounted for only by the great\nexpense of the labour which must have been employed about It, and the\nexpense of this labour again could arise from nothing but the awkwardness\nof the machinery which is made use of. The price of fine woollens, too,\nthough not quite so extravagant, seems, however, to have been much above\nthat of the present times. Some cloths, we are told by Pliny {Plin. 1.\nix.c.39.}, dyed in a particular manner, cost a hundred denarii, or\n\u00a33:6s:8d. the pound weight. Others, dyed in another manner, cost a\nthousand denarii the pound weight, or \u00a333:6s:8d. The Roman pound, it must\nbe remembered, contained only twelve of our avoirdupois ounces. This high\nprice, indeed, seems to have been principally owing to the dye. But had\nnot the cloths themselves been much dearer than any which are made in the\npresent times, so very expensive a dye would not probably have been\nbestowed upon them. The disproportion would have been too great between\nthe value of the accessory and that of the principal. The price mentioned\nby the same author {Plin. 1. viii.c.48.}, of some triclinaria, a sort of\nwoollen pillows or cushions made use of to lean upon as they reclined upon\ntheir couches at table, passes all credibility; some of them being said to\nhave cost more than \u00a330,000, others more than \u00a3300,000. This high price,\ntoo, is not said to have arisen from the dye. In the dress of the people\nof fashion of both sexes, there seems to have been much less variety, it\nis observed by Dr Arbuthnot, in ancient than in modern times; and the\nvery little variety which we find in that of the ancient statues, confirms\nhis observation. He infers from this, that their dress must, upon the\nwhole, have been cheaper than ours; but the conclusion does not seem to\nfollow. When the expense of fashionable dress is very great, the variety\nmust be very small. But when, by the improvements in the productive powers\nof manufacturing art and industry, the expense of any one dress comes to\nbe very moderate, the variety will naturally be very great. The rich, not\nbeing able to distinguish themselves by the expense of any one dress, will\nnaturally endeavour to do so by the multitude and variety of their\ndresses.\nThe greatest and most important branch of the commerce of every nation, it\nhas already been observed, is that which is carried on between the\ninhabitants of the town and those of the country. The inhabitants of the\ntown draw from the country the rude produce, which constitutes both the\nmaterials of their work and the fund of their subsistence; and they pay\nfor this rude produce, by sending back to the country a certain portion of\nit manufactured and prepared for immediate use. The trade which is carried\non between these two different sets of people, consists ultimately in a\ncertain quantity of rude produce exchanged for a certain quantity of\nmanufactured produce. The dearer the latter, therefore, the cheaper the\nformer; and whatever tends in any country to raise the price of\nmanufactured produce, tends to lower that of the rude produce of the land,\nand thereby to discourage agriculture. The smaller the quantity of\nmanufactured produce, which any given quantity of rude produce, or, what\ncomes to the same thing, which the price of any given quantity of rude\nproduce, is capable of purchasing, the smaller the exchangeable value of\nthat given quantity of rude produce; the smaller the encouragement which\neither the landlord has to increase its quantity by improving, or the\nfarmer by cultivating the land. Whatever, besides, tends to diminish in\nany country the number of artificers and manufacturers, tends to diminish\nthe home market, the most important of all markets, for the rude produce\nof the land, and thereby still further to discourage agriculture.\nThose systems, therefore, which preferring agriculture to all other\nemployments, in order to promote it, impose restraints upon manufactures\nand foreign trade, act contrary to the very end which they propose, and\nindirectly discourage that very species of industry which they mean to\npromote. They are so far, perhaps, more inconsistent than even the\nmercantile system. That system, by encouraging manufactures and foreign\ntrade more than agriculture, turns a certain portion of the capital of the\nsociety, from supporting a more advantageous, to support a less\nadvantageous species of industry. But still it really, and in the end,\nencourages that species of industry which it means to promote. Those\nagricultural systems, on the contrary, really, and in the end, discourage\ntheir own favourite species of industry.\nIt is thus that every system which endeavours, either, by extraordinary\nencouragements to draw towards a particular species of industry a greater\nshare of the capital of the society than what would naturally go to it,\nor, by extraordinary restraints, to force from a particular species of\nindustry some share of the capital which would otherwise be employed in\nit, is, in reality, subversive of the great purpose which it means to\npromote. It retards, instead of accelerating the progress of the society\ntowards real wealth and greatness; and diminishes, instead of increasing,\nthe real value of the annual produce of its land and labour.\nAll systems, either of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus\ncompletely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty\nestablishes itself of its own accord. Every man, as long as he does not\nviolate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own\ninterest his own way, and to bring both his industry and capital into\ncompetition with those of any other man, or order of men. The sovereign is\ncompletely discharged from a duty, in the attempting to perform which he\nmust always be exposed to innumerable delusions, and for the proper\nperformance of which, no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be\nsufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and\nof directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interests of\nthe society. According to the system of natural liberty, the sovereign has\nonly three duties to attend to; three duties of great importance, indeed,\nbut plain and intelligible to common understandings: first, the duty of\nprotecting the society from the violence and invasion of other independent\nsocieties; secondly, the duty of protecting, as far as possible, every\nmember of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other\nmember of it, or the duty of establishing an exact administration of\njustice; and, thirdly, the duty of erecting and maintaining certain public\nworks, and certain public institutions, which it can never be for the\ninterest of any individual, or small number of individuals to erect and\nmaintain; because the profit could never repay the expense to any\nindividual, or small number of individuals, though it may frequently do\nmuch more than repay it to a great society.\nThe proper performance of those several duties of the sovereign\nnecessarily supposes a certain expense; and this expense again necessarily\nrequires a certain revenue to support it. In the following book,\ntherefore, I shall endeavour to explain, first, what are the necessary\nexpenses of the sovereign or commonwealth; and which of those expenses\nought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society; and\nwhich of them, by that of some particular part only, or of some particular\nmembers of the society: secondly, what are the different methods in which\nthe whole society may be made to contribute towards defraying the expenses\nincumbent on the whole society; and what are the principal advantages and\ninconveniencies of each of those methods: and thirdly, what are the\nreasons and causes which have induced almost all modern governments to\nmortgage some part of this revenue, or to contract debts; and what have\nbeen the effects of those debts upon the real wealth, the annual produce\nof the land and labour of the society. The following book, therefore, will\nnaturally be divided into three chapters.\nAPPENDIX TO BOOK IV\nThe two following accounts are subjoined, in order to illustrate and\nconfirm what is said in the fifth chapter of the fourth book, concerning\nthe Tonnage Bounty to the Whit-herring Fishery. The reader, I believe, may\ndepend upon the accuracy of both accounts.\nAn account of Busses fitted out in Scotland for eleven Years, with the\nNumber of empty Barrels carried out, and the Number of Barrels of Herrings\ncaught; also the Bounty, at a Medium, on each Barrel of Sea-sricks, and on\neach Barrel when fully packed.\nYears   Number of  Empty Barrels  Barrels of Her-  Bounty paid on\nBusses     carried out    rings caught      the Busses\n\u00a3.  s.  d.\n1771          29        5,948        2,832          2,885   0   0\n1772         168       41,316       22,237         11,055   7   6\n1773         190       42,333       42,055         12,510   8   6\n1774         240       59,303       56,365         26,932   2   6\n1775         275       69,144       52,879         19,315  15   0\n1776         294       76,329       51,863         21,290   7   6\n1777         240       62,679       43,313         17,592   2   6\n1778         220       56,390       40,958         16,316   2   6\n1779         206       55,194       29,367         15,287   0   0\n1780         181       48,315       19,885         13,445  12   6\n1781         135       33,992       16,593          9,613  15   6\nTotals 2,186      550,943      378,347       \u00a3165,463  14   0\nSea-sticks     378,347  Bounty, at a medium, for each\nbarrel of sea-sticks,         \u00a3 0   8   2\u00bc\nBut a barrel of sea-sticks\nbeing only reckoned two thirds\nof a barrel fully packed, one\nthird to be deducted, which\n\u2153 deducted     126,115  brings the bounty to          \u00a3 0  12   3\u00be\nBarrels fully\npacked         252,231\nAnd if the herrings are exported, there is besides a\npremium of   \u00a3 0   2   8\nSo the bounty paid by government in money for each\nbarrel is    \u00a3 0  14  11\u00be\nBut if to this, the duty of the salt usually taken\ncredit for as expended in curing each barrel, which\nat a medium, is, of foreign, one bushel and one-\nfourth of a bushel, at 10s. a-bushel, be added, viz     0  12   6\nthe bounty on each barrel would amount to             \u00a3 1   7   5\u00be\nIf the herrings are cured with British salt, it will\nstand thus, viz.\nBounty as before                                      \u00a3 0  14  11\u00be\nBut if to this bounty, the duty on two bushels of\nScotch salt, at 1s.6d. per bushel, supposed to be\nthe quantity, at a medium, used in curing each\nbarrel is added, viz.                                   0   3   0\nThe bounty on each barrel will amount to              \u00a3 0  17  11\u00be\nAnd when buss herrings are entered for home\nconsumption in Scotland, and pay the shilling a\nbarrel of duty, the bounty stands thus, to wit,\nas before    \u00a3 0  12   3\u00be\nFrom which the shilling a barrel is to be deducted      0   1   0\n\u00a3 0  11   3\u00be\nBut to that there is to be added again, the duty of\nthe foreign salt used curing a barrel of herring viz    0  12   6\nSo that the premium allowed for each barrel of her-\nrings entered for home consumption is                 \u00a3 1   3   9\u00be\nIf the herrings are cured in British salt, it will\nstand as follows viz.\nBounty on each barrel brought in by the busses, as\nabove                                                 \u00a3 0  12   3\u00be\nFrom which deduct 1s. a-barrel, paid at the time\nthey are entered for home consumption                   0   1   0\n\u00a3 0  11   3\u00be\nBut if to the bounty, the the duty on two bushel\nof Scotch salt, at 1s.6d. per bushel supposed to\nbe the quantity, at a medium, used in curing each\nbarrel, is added, viz                                   0   3   0\nthe premium for each barrel entered for home\nconsumption will be                                   \u00a3 1  14   3\u00be\nThough the loss of duties upon herrings exported cannot, perhaps, properly\nbe considered as bounty, that upon herrings entered for home consumption\ncertainly may.\nAn account of the Quantity of Foreign Salt imported into Scotland, and of\nScotch Salt delivered Duty-free from the Works there, for the Fishery,\nfrom the 5th. of April 1771 to the 5th. of April 1782 with the Medium of\nboth for one Year.\nForeign Salt      Scotch Salt delivered\nPERIOD                 imported        from the Works\nBushels              Bushels\nFrom 5th.

Of the Expense of Defence.\nThe first duty of the sovereign, that of protecting the society from the\nviolence and invasion of other independent societies, can be performed\nonly by means of a military force. But the expense both of preparing this\nmilitary force in time of peace, and of employing it in time of war, is\nvery different in the different states of society, in the different\nperiods of improvement.\nAmong nations of hunters, the lowest and rudest state of society, such as\nwe find it among the native tribes of North America, every man is a\nwarrior, as well as a hunter. When he goes to war, either to defend his\nsociety, or to revenge the injuries which have been done to it by other\nsocieties, he maintains himself by his own labour, in the same manner as\nwhen he lives at home. His society (for in this state of things there is\nproperly neither sovereign nor commonwealth) is at no sort of expense,\neither to prepare him for the field, or to maintain him while he is in it.\nAmong nations of shepherds, a more advanced state of society, such as we\nfind it among the Tartars and Arabs, every man is, in the same manner, a\nwarrior. Such nations have commonly no fixed habitation, but live either\nin tents, or in a sort of covered waggons, which are easily transported\nfrom place to place. The whole tribe, or nation, changes its situation\naccording to the different seasons of the year, as well as according to\nother accidents. When its herds and flocks have consumed the forage of one\npart of the country, it removes to another, and from that to a third. In\nthe dry season, it comes down to the banks of the rivers; in the wet\nseason, it retires to the upper country. When such a nation goes to war,\nthe warriors will not trust their herds and flocks to the feeble defence\nof their old men, their women and children; and their old men, their women\nand children, will not be left behind without defence, and without\nsubsistence. The whole nation, besides, being accustomed to a wandering\nlife, even in time of peace, easily takes the field in time of war.\nWhether it marches as an army, or moves about as a company of herdsmen,\nthe way of life is nearly the same, though the object proposed by it be\nvery different. They all go to war together, therefore, and everyone does\nas well as he can. Among the Tartars, even the women have been frequently\nknown to engage in battle. If they conquer, whatever belongs to the\nhostile tribe is the recompence of the victory; but if they are\nvanquished, all is lost; and not only their herds and flocks, but their\nwomen and children become the booty of the conqueror. Even the greater\npart of those who survive the action are obliged to submit to him for the\nsake of immediate subsistence. The rest are commonly dissipated and\ndispersed in the desert.\nThe ordinary life, the ordinary exercise of a Tartar or Arab, prepares him\nsufficiently for war. Running, wrestling, cudgel-playing, throwing the\njavelin, drawing the bow, etc. are the common pastimes of those who live\nin the open air, and are all of them the images of war. When a Tartar or\nArab actually goes to war, he is maintained by his own herds and flocks,\nwhich he carries with him, in the same manner as in peace. His chief or\nsovereign (for those nations have all chiefs or sovereigns) is at no sort\nof expense in preparing him for the field; and when he is in it, the\nchance of plunder is the only pay which he either expects or requires.\nAn army of hunters can seldom exceed two or three hundred men. The\nprecarious subsistence which the chace affords, could seldom allow a\ngreater number to keep together for any considerable time. An army of\nshepherds, on the contrary, may sometimes amount to two or three hundred\nthousand. As long as nothing stops their progress, as long as they can go\non from one district, of which they have consumed the forage, to another,\nwhich is yet entire; there seems to be scarce any limit to the number who\ncan march on together. A nation of hunters can never be formidable to the\ncivilized nations in their neighbourhood; a nation of shepherds may.\nNothing can be more contemptible than an Indian war in North America;\nnothing, on the contrary, can be more dreadful than a Tartar invasion has\nfrequently been in Asia. The judgment of Thucydides, that both Europe and\nAsia could not resist the Scythians united, has been verified by the\nexperience of all ages. The inhabitants of the extensive, but defenceless\nplains of Scythia or Tartary, have been frequently united under the\ndominion of the chief of some conquering horde or clan; and the havock and\ndevastation of Asia have always signalized their union. The inhabitants of\nthe inhospitable deserts of Arabia, the other great nation of shepherds,\nhave never been united but once, under Mahomet and his immediate\nsuccessors. Their union, which was more the effect of religious enthusiasm\nthan of conquest, was signalized in the same manner. If the hunting\nnations of America should ever become shepherds, their neighbourhood would\nbe much more dangerous to the European colonies than it is at present.\nIn a yet more advanced state of society, among those nations of husbandmen\nwho have little foreign commerce, and no other manufactures but those\ncoarse and household ones, which almost every private family prepares for\nits own use, every man, in the same manner, either is a warrior, or easily\nbecomes such. Those who live by agriculture generally pass the whole day\nin the open air, exposed to all the inclemencies of the seasons. The\nhardiness of their ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues of war, to\nsome of which their necessary occupations bear a great analogy. The\nnecessary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in the trenches,\nand to fortify a camp, as well as to inclose a field. The ordinary\npastimes of such husbandmen are the same as those of shepherds, and are in\nthe same manner the images of war. But as husbandmen have less leisure\nthan shepherds, they are not so frequently employed in those pastimes.\nThey are soldiers but soldiers not quite so much masters of their\nexercise. Such as they are, however, it seldom costs the sovereign or\ncommonwealth any expense to prepare them for the field.\nAgriculture, even in its rudest and lowest state, supposes a settlement,\nsome sort of fixed habitation, which cannot be abandoned without great\nloss. When a nation of mere husbandmen, therefore, goes to war, the whole\npeople cannot take the field together. The old men, the women and\nchildren, at least, must remain at home, to take care of the habitation.\nAll the men of the military age, however, may take the field, and in small\nnations of this kind, have frequently done so. In every nation, the men of\nthe military age are supposed to amount to about a fourth or a fifth part\nof the whole body of the people. If the campaign, too, should begin after\nseedtime, and end before harvest, both the husbandman and his principal\nlabourers can be spared from the farm without much loss. He trusts that\nthe work which must be done in the mean time, can be well enough executed\nby the old men, the women, and the children. He is not unwilling,\ntherefore, to serve without pay during a short campaign; and it frequently\ncosts the sovereign or commonwealth as little to maintain him in the field\nas to prepare him for it. The citizens of all the different states of\nancient Greece seem to have served in this manner till after the second\nPersian war; and the people of Peloponnesus till after the Peloponnesian\nwar. The Peloponnesians, Thucydides observes, generally left the field in\nthe summer, and returned home to reap the harvest. The Roman people, under\ntheir kings, and during the first ages of the republic, served in the same\nmanner. It was not till the seige of Veii, that they who staid at home\nbegan to contribute something towards maintaining those who went to war.\nIn the European monarchies, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman\nempire, both before, and for some time after, the establishment of what is\nproperly called the feudal law, the great lords, with all their immediate\ndependents, used to serve the crown at their own expense. In the field, in\nthe same manner as at home, they maintained themselves by their own\nrevenue, and not by any stipend or pay which they received from the king\nupon that particular occasion.\nIn a more advanced state of society, two different causes contribute to\nrender it altogether impossible that they who take the field should\nmaintain themselves at their own expense. Those two causes are, the\nprogress of manufactures, and the improvement in the art of war.\nThough a husbandman should be employed in an expedition, provided it\nbegins after seedtime, and ends before harvest, the interruption of his\nbusiness will not always occasion any considerable diminution of his\nrevenue. Without the intervention of his labour, Nature does herself the\ngreater part of the work which remains to be done. But the moment that an\nartificer, a smith, a carpenter, or a weaver, for example, quits his\nworkhouse, the sole source of his revenue is completely dried up. Nature\ndoes nothing for him; he does all for himself. When he takes the field,\ntherefore, in defence of the public, as he has no revenue to maintain\nhimself, he must necessarily be maintained by the public. But in a\ncountry, of which a great part of the inhabitants are artificers and\nmanufacturers, a great part of the people who go to war must be drawn from\nthose classes, and must, therefore, be maintained by the public as long as\nthey are employed in its service.\nWhen the art of war, too, has gradually grown up to be a very intricate\nand complicated science; when the event of war ceases to be determined, as\nin the first ages of society, by a single irregular skirmish or battle;\nbut when the contest is generally spun out through several different\ncampaigns, each of which lasts during the greater part of the year; it\nbecomes universally necessary that the public should maintain those who\nserve the public in war, at least while they are employed in that service.\nWhatever, in time of peace, might be the ordinary occupation of those who\ngo to war, so very tedious and expensive a service would otherwise be by\nfar too heavy a burden upon them. After the second Persian war,\naccordingly, the armies of Athens seem to have been generally composed of\nmercenary troops, consisting, indeed, partly of citizens, but partly, too,\nof foreigners; and all of them equally hired and paid at the expense of\nthe state. From the time of the siege of Veii, the armies of Rome received\npay for their service during the time which they remained in the field.\nUnder the feudal governments, the military service, both of the great\nlords, and of their immediate dependents, was, after a certain period,\nuniversally exchanged for a payment in money, which was employed to\nmaintain those who served in their stead.\nThe number of those who can go to war, in proportion to the whole number\nof the people, is necessarily much smaller in a civilized than in a rude\nstate of society. In a civilized society, as the soldiers are maintained\naltogether by the labour of those who are not soldiers, the number of the\nformer can never exceed what the latter can maintain, over and above\nmaintaining, in a manner suitable to their respective stations, both\nthemselves and the other officers of government and law, whom they are\nobliged to maintain. In the little agrarian states of ancient Greece, a\nfourth or a fifth part of the whole body of the people considered the\nthemselves as soldiers, and would sometimes, it is said, take the field.\nAmong the civilized nations of modern Europe, it is commonly computed,\nthat not more than the one hundredth part of the inhabitants of any\ncountry can be employed as soldiers, without ruin to the country which\npays the expense of their service.\nThe expense of preparing the army for the field seems not to have become\nconsiderable in any nation, till long after that of maintaining it in the\nfield had devolved entirely upon the sovereign or commonwealth. In all the\ndifferent republics of ancient Greece, to learn his military exercises,\nwas a necessary part of education imposed by the state upon every free\ncitizen. In every city there seems to have been a public field, in which,\nunder the protection of the public magistrate, the young people were\ntaught their different exercises by different masters. In this very simple\ninstitution consisted the whole expense which any Grecian state seems ever\nto have been at, in preparing its citizens for war. In ancient Rome, the\nexercises of the Campus Martius answered the same purpose with those of\nthe Gymnasium in ancient Greece. Under the feudal governments, the many\npublic ordinances, that the citizens of every district should practise\narchery, as well as several other military exercises, were intended for\npromoting the same purpose, but do not seem to have promoted it so well.\nEither from want of interest in the officers entrusted with the execution\nof those ordinances, or from some other cause, they appear to have been\nuniversally neglected; and in the progress of all those governments,\nmilitary exercises seem to have gone gradually into disuse among the great\nbody of the people.\nIn the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, during the whole period of\ntheir existence, and under the feudal governments, for a considerable time\nafter their first establishment, the trade of a soldier was not a\nseparate, distinct trade, which constituted the sole or principal\noccupation of a particular class of citizens; every subject of the state,\nwhatever might be the ordinary trade or occupation by which he gained his\nlivelihood, considered himself, upon all ordinary occasions, as fit\nlikewise to exercise the trade of a soldier, and, upon many extraordinary\noccasions, as bound to exercise it.\nThe art of war, however, as it is certainly the noblest of all arts, so,\nin the progress of improvement, it necessarily becomes one of the most\ncomplicated among them. The state of the mechanical, as well as some other\narts, with which it is necessarily connected, determines the degree of\nperfection to which it is capable of being carried at any particular time.\nBut in order to carry it to this degree of perfection, it is necessary\nthat it should become the sole or principal occupation of a particular\nclass of citizens; and the division of labour is as necessary for the\nimprovement of this, as of every other art. Into other arts, the division\nof labour is naturally introduced by the prudence of individuals, who find\nthat they promote their private interest better by confining themselves to\na particular trade, than by exercising a great number. But it is the\nwisdom of the state only, which can render the trade of a soldier a\nparticular trade, separate and distinct from all others. A private\ncitizen, who, in time of profound peace, and without any particular\nencouragement from the public, should spend the greater part of his time\nin military exercises, might, no doubt, both improve himself very much in\nthem, and amuse himself very well; but he certainly would not promote his\nown interest. It is the wisdom of the state only, which can render it for\nhis interest to give up the greater part of his time to this peculiar\noccupation; and states have not always had this wisdom, even when their\ncircumstances had become such, that the preservation of their existence\nrequired that they should have it.\nA shepherd has a great deal of leisure; a husbandman, in the rude state of\nhusbandry, has some; an artificer or manufacturer has none at all. The\nfirst may, without any loss, employ a great deal of his time in martial\nexercises; the second may employ some part of it; but the last cannot\nemploy a single hour in them without some loss, and his attention to his\nown interest naturally leads him to neglect them altogether. Those\nimprovements in husbandry, too, which the progress of arts and\nmanufactures necessarily introduces, leave the husbandman as little\nleisure as the artificer. Military exercises come to be as much neglected\nby the inhabitants of the country as by those of the town, and the great\nbody of the people becomes altogether unwarlike. That wealth, at the same\ntime, which always follows the improvements of agriculture and\nmanufactures, and which, in reality, is no more than the accumulated\nproduce of those improvements, provokes the invasion of all their\nneighbours. An industrious, and, upon that account, a wealthy nation, is\nof all nations the most likely to be attacked; and unless the state takes\nsome new measure for the public defence, the natural habits of the people\nrender them altogether incapable of defending themselves.\nIn these circumstances, there seem to be but two methods by which the\nstate can make any tolerable provision for the public defence.\nIt may either, first, by means of a very rigorous police, and in spite of\nthe whole bent of the interest, genius, and inclinations of the people,\nenforce the practice of military exercises, and oblige either all the\ncitizens of the military age, or a certain number of them, to join in some\nmeasure the trade of a soldier to whatever other trade or profession they\nmay happen to carry on.\nOr, secondly, by maintaining and employing a certain number of citizens in\nthe constant practice of military exercises, it may render the trade of a\nsoldier a particular trade, separate and distinct from all others.\nIf the state has recourse to the first of those two expedients, its\nmilitary force is said to consist in a militia; if to the second, it is\nsaid to consist in a standing army. The practice of military exercises is\nthe sole or principal occupation of the soldiers of a standing army, and\nthe maintenance or pay which the state affords them is the principal and\nordinary fund of their subsistence. The practice of military exercises is\nonly the occasional occupation of the soldiers of a militia, and they\nderive the principal and ordinary fund of their subsistence from some\nother occupation. In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer,\nor tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier; in a standing army,\nthat of the soldier predominates over every other character; and in this\ndistinction seems to consist the essential difference between those two\ndifferent species of military force.\nMilitias have been of several different kinds. In some countries, the\ncitizens destined for defending the state seem to have been exercised\nonly, without being, if I may say so, regimented; that is, without being\ndivided into separate and distinct bodies of troops, each of which\nperformed its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers. In\nthe republics of ancient Greece and Rome, each citizen, as long as he\nremained at home, seems to have practised his exercises, either separately\nand independently, or with such of his equals as he liked best; and not to\nhave been attached to any particular body of troops, till he was actually\ncalled upon to take the field. In other countries, the militia has not\nonly been exercised, but regimented. In England, in Switzerland, and, I\nbelieve, in every other country of modern Europe, where any imperfect\nmilitary force of this kind has been established, every militiaman is,\neven in time of peace, attached to a particular body of troops, which\nperforms its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers.\nBefore the invention of fire-arms, that army was superior in which the\nsoldiers had, each individually, the greatest skill and dexterity in the\nuse of their arms. Strength and agility of body were of the highest\nconsequence, and commonly determined the fate of battles. But this skill\nand dexterity in the use of their arms could be acquired only, in the same\nmanner as fencing is at present, by practising, not in great bodies, but\neach man separately, in a particular school, under a particular master, or\nwith his own particular equals and companions. Since the invention of\nfire-arms, strength and agility of body, or even extraordinary dexterity\nand skill in the use of arms, though they are far from being of no\nconsequence, are, however, of less consequence. The nature of the weapon,\nthough it by no means puts the awkward upon a level with the skilful, puts\nhim more nearly so than he ever was before. All the dexterity and skill,\nit is supposed, which are necessary for using it, can be well enough\nacquired by practising in great bodies.\nRegularity, order, and prompt obedience to command, are qualities which,\nin modern armies, are of more importance towards determining the fate of\nbattles, than the dexterity and skill of the soldiers in the use of their\narms. But the noise of fire-arms, the smoke, and the invisible death to\nwhich every man feels himself every moment exposed, as soon as he comes\nwithin cannon-shot, and frequently a long time before the battle can be\nwell said to be engaged, must render it very difficult to maintain any\nconsiderable degree of this regularity, order, and prompt obedience, even\nin the beginning of a modern battle. In an ancient battle, there was no\nnoise but what arose from the human voice; there was no smoke, there was\nno invisible cause of wounds or death. Every man, till some mortal weapon\nactually did approach him, saw clearly that no such weapon was near him.\nIn these circumstances, and among troops who had some confidence in their\nown skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, it must have been a good\ndeal less difficult to preserve some degree of regularity and order, not\nonly in the beginning, but through the whole progress of an ancient\nbattle, and till one of the two armies was fairly defeated. But the habits\nof regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command, can be acquired\nonly by troops which are exercised in great bodies.\nA militia, however, in whatever manner it may be either disciplined or\nexercised, must always be much inferior to a well disciplined and well\nexercised standing army.\nThe soldiers who are exercised only once a week, or once a-month, can\nnever be so expert in the use of their arms, as those who are exercised\nevery day, or every other day; and though this circumstance may not be of\nso much consequence in modern, as it was in ancient times, yet the\nacknowledged superiority of the Prussian troops, owing, it is said, very\nmuch to their superior expertness in their exercise, may satisfy us that\nit is, even at this day, of very considerable consequence.\nThe soldiers, who are bound to obey their officer only once a-week, or\nonce a-month, and who are at all other times at liberty to manage their\nown affairs their own way, without being, in any respect, accountable to\nhim, can never be under the same awe in his presence, can never have the\nsame disposition to ready obedience, with those whose whole life and\nconduct are every day directed by him, and who every day even rise and go\nto bed, or at least retire to their quarters, according to his orders. In\nwhat is called discipline, or in the habit of ready obedience, a militia\nmust always be still more inferior to a standing army, than it may\nsometimes be in what is called the manual exercise, or in the management\nand use of its arms. But, in modern war, the habit of ready and instant\nobedience is of much greater consequence than a considerable superiority\nin the management of arms.\nThose militias which, like the Tartar or Arab militia, go to war under the\nsame chieftains whom they are accustomed to obey in peace, are by far the\nbest. In respect for their officers, in the habit of ready obedience, they\napproach nearest to standing armies. The Highland militia, when it served\nunder its own chieftains, had some advantage of the same kind. As the\nHighlanders, however, were not wandering, but stationary shepherds, as\nthey had all a fixed habitation, and were not, in peaceable times,\naccustomed to follow their chieftain from place to place; so, in time of\nwar, they were less willing to follow him to any considerable distance, or\nto continue for any long time in the field. When they had acquired any\nbooty, they were eager to return home, and his authority was seldom\nsufficient to detain them. In point of obedience, they were always much\ninferior to what is reported of the Tartars and Arabs. As the Highlanders,\ntoo, from their stationary life, spend less of their time in the open air,\nthey were always less accustomed to military exercises, and were less\nexpert in the use of their arms than the Tartars and Arabs are said to be.\nA militia of any kind, it must be observed, however, which has served for\nseveral successive campaigns in the field, becomes in every respect a\nstanding army. The soldiers are every day exercised in the use of their\narms, and, being constantly under the command of their officers, are\nhabituated to the same prompt obedience which takes place in standing\narmies. What they were before they took the field, is of little\nimportance. They necessarily become in every respect a standing army,\nafter they have passed a few campaigns in it. Should the war in America\ndrag out through another campaign, the American militia may become, in\nevery respect, a match for that standing army, of which the valour\nappeared, in the last war at least, not inferior to that of the hardiest\nveterans of France and Spain.\nThis distinction being well understood, the history of all ages, it will\nbe found, hears testimony to the irresistible superiority which a well\nregulated standing army has over a militia.\nOne of the first standing armies, of which we have any distinct account in\nany well authenticated history, is that of Philip of Macedon. His frequent\nwars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some of the Greek\ncities in the neighbourhood of Macedon, gradually formed his troops, which\nin the beginning were probably militia, to the exact discipline of a\nstanding army. When he was at peace, which he was very seldom, and never\nfor any long time together, he was careful not to disband that army. It\nvanquished and subdued, after a long and violent struggle, indeed, the\ngallant and well exercised militias of the principal republics of ancient\nGreece; and afterwards, with very little struggle, the effeminate and ill\nexercised militia of the great Persian empire. The fall of the Greek\nrepublics, and of the Persian empire was the effect of the irresistible\nsuperiority which a standing arm has over every other sort of militia. It\nis the first great revolution in the affairs of mankind of which history\nhas preserved any distinct and circumstantial account.\nThe fall of Carthage, and the consequent elevation of Rome, is the second.\nAll the varieties in the fortune of those two famous republics may very\nwell be accounted for from the same cause.\nFrom the end of the first to the beginning of the second Carthaginian war,\nthe armies of Carthage were continually in the field, and employed under\nthree great generals, who succeeded one another in the command; Amilcar,\nhis son-in-law Asdrubal, and his son Annibal: first in chastising their\nown rebellious slaves, afterwards in subduing the revolted nations of\nAfrica; and lastly, in conquering the great kingdom of Spain. The army\nwhich Annibal led from Spain into Italy must necessarily, in those\ndifferent wars, have been gradually formed to the exact discipline of a\nstanding army. The Romans, in the meantime, though they had not been\naltogether at peace, yet they had not, during this period, been engaged in\nany war of very great consequence; and their military discipline, it is\ngenerally said, was a good deal relaxed. The Roman armies which Annibal\nencountered at Trebi, Thrasymenus, and Cannae, were militia opposed to a\nstanding army. This circumstance, it is probable, contributed more than\nany other to determine the fate of those battles.\nThe standing army which Annibal left behind him in Spain had the like\nsuperiority over the militia which the Romans sent to oppose it; and, in a\nfew years, under the command of his brother, the younger Asdrubal,\nexpelled them almost entirely from that country.\nAnnibal was ill supplied from home. The Roman militia, being continually\nin the field, became, in the progress of the war, a well disciplined and\nwell exercised standing army; and the superiority of Annibal grew every\nday less and less. Asdrubal judged it necessary to lead the whole, or\nalmost the whole, of the standing army which he commanded in Spain, to the\nassistance of his brother in Italy. In this march, he is said to have been\nmisled by his guides; and in a country which he did not know, was\nsurprised and attacked, by another standing army, in every respect equal\nor superior to his own, and was entirely defeated.\nWhen Asdrubal had left Spain, the great Scipio found nothing to oppose him\nbut a militia inferior to his own. He conquered and subdued that militia,\nand, in the course of the war, his own militia necessarily became a well\ndisciplined and well exercised standing army. That standing army was\nafterwards carried to Africa, where it found nothing but a militia to\noppose it. In order to defend Carthage, it became necessary to recal the\nstanding army of Annibal. The disheartened and frequently defeated African\nmilitia joined it, and, at the battle of Zama, composed the greater part\nof the troops of Annibal. The event of that day determined the fate of the\ntwo rival republics.\nFrom the end of the second Carthaginian war till the fall of the Roman\nrepublic, the armies of Rome were in every respect standing armies. The\nstanding army of Macedon made some resistance to their arms. In the height\nof their grandeur, it cost them two great wars, and three great battles,\nto subdue that little kingdom, of which the conquest would probably have\nbeen still more difficult, had it not been for the cowardice of its last\nking. The militias of all the civilized nations of the ancient world, of\nGreece, of Syria, and of Egypt, made but a feeble resistance to the\nstanding armies of Rome. The militias of some barbarous nations defended\nthemselves much better. The Scythian or Tartar militia, which Mithridates\ndrew from the countries north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, were the\nmost formidable enemies whom the Romans had to encounter after the second\nCarthaginian war. The Parthian and German militias, too, were always\nrespectable, and upon several occasions, gained very considerable\nadvantages over the Roman armies. In general, however, and when the Roman\narmies were well commanded, they appear to have been very much superior;\nand if the Romans did not pursue the final conquest either of Parthia or\nGermany, it was probably because they judged that it was not worth while\nto add those two barbarous countries to an empire which was already too\nlarge. The ancient Parthians appear to have been a nation of Scythian or\nTartar extraction, and to have always retained a good deal of the manners\nof their ancestors. The ancient Germans were, like the Scythians or\nTartars, a nation of wandering shepherds, who went to war under the same\nchiefs whom they were accustomed to follow in peace. \u2018Their militia was\nexactly of the same kind with that of the Scythians or Tartars, from whom,\ntoo, they were probably descended.\u2019\nMany different causes contributed to relax the discipline of the Roman\narmies. Its extreme severity was, perhaps, one of those causes. In the\ndays of their grandeur, when no enemy appeared capable of opposing them,\ntheir heavy armour was laid aside as unnecessarily burdensome, their\nlaborious exercises were neglected, as unnecessarily toilsome. Under the\nRoman emperors, besides, the standing armies of Rome, those particularly\nwhich guarded the German and Pannonian frontiers, became dangerous to\ntheir masters, against whom they used frequently to set up their own\ngenerals. In order to render them less formidable, according to some\nauthors, Dioclesian, according to others, Constantine, first withdrew them\nfrom the frontier, where they had always before been encamped in great\nbodies, generally of two or three legions each, and dispersed them in\nsmall bodies through the different provincial towns, from whence they were\nscarce ever removed, but when it became necessary to repel an invasion.\nSmall bodies of soldiers, quartered in trading and manufacturing towns,\nand seldom removed from those quarters, became themselves trades men,\nartificers, and manufacturers. The civil came to predominate over the\nmilitary character; and the standing armies of Rome gradually degenerated\ninto a corrupt, neglected, and undisciplined militia, incapable of\nresisting the attack of the German and Scythian militias, which soon\nafterwards invaded the western empire. It was only by hiring the militia\nof some of those nations to oppose to that of others, that the emperors\nwere for some time able to defend themselves. The fall of the western\nempire is the third great revolution in the affairs of mankind, of which\nancient history has preserved any distinct or circumstantial account. It\nwas brought about by the irresistible superiority which the militia of a\nbarbarous has over that of a civilized nation; which the militia of a\nnation of shepherds has over that of a nation of husbandmen, artificers,\nand manufacturers. The victories which have been gained by militias have\ngenerally been, not over standing armies, but over other militias, in\nexercise and discipline inferior to themselves. Such were the victories\nwhich the Greek militia gained over that of the Persian empire; and such,\ntoo, were those which, in later times, the Swiss militia gained over that\nof the Austrians and Burgundians.\nThe military force of the German and Scythian nations, who established\nthemselves upon ruins of the western empire, continued for some time to be\nof the same kind in their new settlements, as it had been in their\noriginal country. It was a militia of shepherds and husbandmen, which, in\ntime of war, took the field under the command of the same chieftains whom\nit was accustomed to obey in peace. It was, therefore, tolerably well\nexercised, and tolerably well disciplined. As arts and industry advanced,\nhowever, the authority of the chieftains gradually decayed, and the great\nbody of the people had less time to spare for military exercises. Both the\ndiscipline and the exercise of the feudal militia, therefore, went\ngradually to ruin, and standing armies were gradually introduced to supply\nthe place of it. When the expedient of a standing army, besides, had once\nbeen adopted by one civilized nation, it became necessary that all its\nneighbours should follow the example. They soon found that their safety\ndepended upon their doing so, and that their own militia was altogether\nincapable of resisting the attack of such an army.\nThe soldiers of a standing army, though they may never have seen an enemy,\nyet have frequently appeared to possess all the courage of veteran troops,\nand, the very moment that they took the field, to have been fit to face\nthe hardiest and most experienced veterans. In 1756, when the Russian army\nmarched into Poland, the valour of the Russian soldiers did not appear\ninferior to that of the Prussians, at that time supposed to be the\nhardiest and most experienced veterans in Europe. The Russian empire,\nhowever, had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty years before, and\ncould at that time have very few soldiers who had ever seen an enemy. When\nthe Spanish war broke out in 1739, England had enjoyed a profound peace\nfor about eight-and-twenty years. The valour of her soldiers, however, far\nfrom being corrupted by that long peace, was never more distinguished than\nin the attempt upon Carthagena, the first unfortunate exploit of that\nunfortunate war. In a long peace, the generals, perhaps, may sometimes\nforget their skill; but where a well regulated standing army has been kept\nup, the soldiers seem never to forget their valour.\nWhen a civilized nation depends for its defence upon a militia, it is at\nall times exposed to be conquered by any barbarous nation which happens to\nbe in its neighbourhood. The frequent conquests of all the civilized\ncountries in Asia by the Tartars, sufficiently demonstrates the natural\nsuperiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized\nnation. A well regulated standing army is superior to every militia. Such\nan army, as it can best be maintained by an opulent and civilized nation,\nso it can alone defend such a nation against the invasion of a poor and\nbarbarous neighbour. It is only by means of a standing army, therefore,\nthat the civilization of any country can be perpetuated, or even\npreserved, for any considerable time.\nAs it is only by means of a well regulated standing army, that a civilized\ncountry can be defended, so it is only by means of it that a barbarous\ncountry can be suddenly and tolerably civilized. A standing army\nestablishes, with an irresistible force, the law of the sovereign through\nthe remotest provinces of the empire, and maintains some degree of regular\ngovernment in countries which could not otherwise admit of any. Whoever\nexamines with attention, the improvements which Peter the Great introduced\ninto the Russian empire, will find that they almost all resolve themselves\ninto the establishment of a well regulated standing army. It is the\ninstrument which executes and maintains all his other regulations. That\ndegree of order and internal peace, which that empire has ever since\nenjoyed, is altogether owing to the influence of that army.\nMen of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army, as\ndangerous to liberty. It certainly is so, wherever the interest of the\ngeneral, and that of the principal officers, are not necessarily connected\nwith the support of the constitution of the state. The standing army of\nCaesar destroyed the Roman republic. The standing army of Cromwell turned\nthe long parliament out of doors. But where the sovereign is himself the\ngeneral, and the principal nobility and gentry of the country the chief\nofficers of the army; where the military force is placed under the command\nof those who have the greatest interest in the support of the civil\nauthority, because they have themselves the greatest share of that\nauthority, a standing army can never be dangerous to liberty. On the\ncontrary, it may, in some cases, be favourable to liberty. The security\nwhich it gives to the sovereign renders unnecessary that troublesome\njealousy, which, in some modern republics, seems to watch over the\nminutest actions, and to be at all times ready to disturb the peace of\nevery citizen. Where the security of the magistrate, though supported by\nthe principal people of the country, is endangered by every popular\ndiscontent; where a small tumult is capable of bringing about in a few\nhours a great revolution, the whole authority of government must be\nemployed to suppress and punish every murmur and complaint against it. To\na sovereign, on the contrary, who feels himself supported, not only by the\nnatural aristocracy of the country, but by a well regulated standing army,\nthe rudest, the most groundless, and the most licentious remonstrances,\ncan give little disturbance. He can safely pardon or neglect them, and his\nconsciousness of his own superiority naturally disposes him to do so. That\ndegree of liberty which approaches to licentiousness, can be tolerated\nonly in countries where the sovereign is secured by a well regulated\nstanding army. It is in such countries only, that the public safety does\nnot require that the sovereign should be trusted with any discretionary\npower, for suppressing even the impertinent wantonness of this licentious\nliberty.\nThe first duty of the sovereign, therefore, that of defending the society\nfrom the violence and injustice of other independent societies, grows\ngradually more and more expensive, as the society advances in\ncivilization. The military force of the society, which originally cost the\nsovereign no expense, either in time of peace, or in time of war, must, in\nthe progress of improvement, first be maintained by him in time of war,\nand afterwards even in time of peace.\nThe great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of\nfire-arms, has enhanced still further both the expense of exercising and\ndisciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace, and that\nof employing them in time of war. Both their arms and their ammunition are\nbecome more expensive. A musket is a more expensive machine than a javelin\nor a bow and arrows; a cannon or a mortar, than a balista or a catapulta.\nThe powder which is spent in a modern review is lost irrecoverably, and\noccasions a very considerable expense. The javelins and arrows which were\nthrown or shot in an ancient one, could easily be picked up again, and\nwere, besides, of very little value. The cannon and the mortar are not\nonly much dearer, but much heavier machines than the balista or catapulta;\nand require a greater expense, not only to prepare them for the field, but\nto carry them to it. As the superiority of the modern artillery, too, over\nthat of the ancients, is very great; it has become much more difficult,\nand consequently much more expensive, to fortify a town, so as to resist,\neven for a few weeks, the attack of that superior artillery. In modern\ntimes, many different causes contribute to render the defence of the\nsociety more expensive. The unavoidable effects of the natural progress of\nimprovement have, in this respect, been a good deal enhanced by a great\nrevolution in the art of war, to which a mere accident, the invention of\ngunpowder, seems to have given occasion.\nIn modern war, the great expense of firearms gives an evident advantage to\nthe nation which can best afford that expense; and, consequently, to an\nopulent and civilized, over a poor and barbarous nation. In ancient times,\nthe opulent and civilized found it difficult to defend themselves against\nthe poor and barbarous nations. In modern times, the poor and barbarous\nfind it difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and civilized.\nThe invention of fire-arms, an invention which at first sight appears to\nbe so pernicious, is certainly favourable, both to the permanency and to\nthe extension of civilization.\nPART II. Of the Expense of Justice\nThe second duty of the sovereign, that of protecting, as far as possible,\nevery member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every\nother member of it, or the duty of establishing an exact administration of\njustice, requires two very different degrees of expense in the different\nperiods of society.\nAmong nations of hunters, as there is scarce any property, or at least\nnone that exceeds the value of two or three days labour; so there is\nseldom any established magistrate, or any regular administration of\njustice. Men who have no property, can injure one another only in their\npersons or reputations. But when one man kills, wounds, beats, or defames\nanother, though he to whom the injury is done suffers, he who does it\nreceives no benefit. It is otherwise with the injuries to property. The\nbenefit of the person who does the injury is often equal to the loss of\nhim who suffers it. Envy, malice, or resentment, are the only passions\nwhich can prompt one man to injure another in his person or reputation.\nBut the greater part of men are not very frequently under the influence of\nthose passions; and the very worst men are so only occasionally. As their\ngratification, too, how agreeable soever it may be to certain characters,\nis not attended with any real or permanent advantage, it is, in the\ngreater part of men, commonly restrained by prudential considerations. Men\nmay live together in society with some tolerable degree of security,\nthough there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of\nthose passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the\nhatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the\npassions which prompt to invade property; passions much more steady in\ntheir operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever\nthere is a great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich\nman, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the\nfew supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites\nthe indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and\nprompted by envy to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter\nof the civil magistrate, that the owner of that valuable property, which\nis acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive\ngenerations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times\nsurrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can\nnever appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the\npowerful arm of the civil magistrate, continually held up to chastise it.\nThe acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily\nrequires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no\nproperty, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days\nlabour, civil government is not so necessary.\nCivil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of\ncivil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable\nproperty; so the principal causes, which naturally introduce\nsubordination, gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable\nproperty.\nThe causes or circumstances which naturally introduce subordination, or\nwhich naturally and antecedent to any civil institution, give some men\nsome superiority over the greater part of their brethren, seem to be four\nin number.\nThe first of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of personal\nqualifications, of strength, beauty, and agility of body; of wisdom and\nvirtue; of prudence, justice, fortitude, and moderation of mind. The\nqualifications of the body, unless supported by those of the mind, can\ngive little authority in any period of society. He is a very strong man,\nwho, by mere strength of body, can force two weak ones to obey him. The\nqualifications of the mind can alone give very great authority. They are\nhowever, invisible qualities; always disputable, and generally disputed.\nNo society, whether barbarous or civilized, has ever found it convenient\nto settle the rules of precedency of rank and subordination, according to\nthose invisible qualities; but according to something that is more plain\nand palpable.\nThe second of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of age. An\nold man, provided his age is not so far advanced as to give suspicion of\ndotage, is everywhere more respected than a young man of equal rank,\nfortune, and abilities. Among nations of hunters, such as the native\ntribes of North America, age is the sole foundation of rank and\nprecedency. Among them, father is the appellation of a superior; brother,\nof an equal; and son, of an inferior. In the most opulent and civilized\nnations, age regulates rank among those who are in every other respect\nequal; and among whom, therefore, there is nothing else to regulate it.\nAmong brothers and among sisters, the eldest always takes place; and in\nthe succession of the paternal estate, every thing which cannot be\ndivided, but must go entire to one person, such as a title of honour, is\nin most cases given to the eldest. Age is a plain and palpable quality,\nwhich admits of no dispute.\nThe third of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of fortune.\nThe authority of riches, however, though great in every age of society,\nis, perhaps, greatest in the rudest ages of society, which admits of any\nconsiderable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increase of whose\nflocks and herds is sufficient to maintain a thousand men, cannot well\nemploy that increase in any other way than in maintaining a thousand men.\nThe rude state of his society does not afford him any manufactured produce\nany trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he can exchange that part\nof his rude produce which is over and above his own consumption. The\nthousand men whom he thus maintains, depending entirely upon him for their\nsubsistence, must both obey his orders in war, and submit to his\njurisdiction in peace. He is necessarily both their general and their\njudge, and his chieftainship is the necessary effect of the superiority of\nhis fortune. In an opulent and civilized society, a man may possess a much\ngreater fortune, and yet not be able to command a dozen of people. Though\nthe produce of his estate may be sufficient to maintain, and may, perhaps,\nactually maintain, more than a thousand people, yet, as those people pay\nfor every thing which they get from him, as he gives scarce any thing to\nany body but in exchange for an equivalent, there is scarce anybody who\nconsiders himself as entirely dependent upon him, and his authority\nextends only over a few menial servants. The authority of fortune,\nhowever, is very great, even in an opulent and civilized society. That it\nis much greater than that either of age or of personal qualities, has been\nthe constant complaint of every period of society which admitted of any\nconsiderable inequality of fortune. The first period of society, that of\nhunters, admits of no such inequality. Universal poverty establishes their\nuniversal equality; and the superiority, either of age or of personal\nqualities, are the feeble, but the sole foundations of authority and\nsubordination. There is, therefore, little or no authority or\nsubordination in this period of society. The second period of society,\nthat of shepherds, admits of very great inequalities of fortune, and there\nis no period in which the superiority of fortune gives so great authority\nto those who possess it. There is no period, accordingly, in which\nauthority and subordination are more perfectly established. The authority\nof an Arabian scherif is very great; that of a Tartar khan altogether\ndespotical.\nThe fourth of those causes or circumstances, is the superiority of birth.\nSuperiority of birth supposes an ancient superiority of fortune in the\nfamily of the person who claims it. All families are equally ancient; and\nthe ancestors of the prince, though they may be better known, cannot well\nbe more numerous than those of the beggar. Antiquity of family means\neverywhere the antiquity either of wealth, or of that greatness which is\ncommonly either founded upon wealth, or accompanied with it. Upstart\ngreatness is everywhere less respected than ancient greatness. The hatred\nof usurpers, the love of the family of an ancient monarch, are in a great\nmeasure founded upon the contempt which men naturally have for the former,\nand upon their veneration for the latter. As a military officer submits,\nwithout reluctance, to the authority of a superior by whom he has always\nbeen commanded, but cannot bear that his inferior should be set over his\nhead; so men easily submit to a family to whom they and their ancestors\nhave always submitted; but are fired with indignation when another family,\nin whom they had never acknowledged any such superiority, assumes a\ndominion over them.\nThe distinction of birth, being subsequent to the inequality of fortune,\ncan have no place in nations of hunters, among whom all men, being equal\nin fortune, must likewise be very nearly equal in birth. The son of a wise\nand brave man may, indeed, even among them, be somewhat more respected\nthan a man of equal merit, who has the misfortune to be the son of a fool\nor a coward. The difference, however will not be very great; and there\nnever was, I believe, a great family in the world, whose illustration was\nentirely derived from the inheritance of wisdom and virtue.\nThe distinction of birth not only may, but always does, take place among\nnations of shepherds. Such nations are always strangers to every sort of\nluxury, and great wealth can scarce ever be dissipated among them by\nimprovident profusion. There are no nations, accordingly, who abound more\nin families revered and honoured on account of their descent from a long\nrace of great and illustrious ancestors; because there are no nations\namong whom wealth is likely to continue longer in the same families.\nBirth and fortune are evidently the two circumstances which principally\nset one man above another. They are the two great sources of personal\ndistinction, and are, therefore, the principal causes which naturally\nestablish authority and subordination among men. Among nations of\nshepherds, both those causes operate with their full force. The great\nshepherd or herdsman, respected on account of his great wealth, and of the\ngreat number of those who depend upon him for subsistence, and revered on\naccount of the nobleness of his birth, and of the immemorial antiquity or\nhis illustrious family, has a natural authority over all the inferior\nshepherds or herdsmen of his horde or clan. He can command the united\nforce of a greater number of people than any of them. His military power\nis greater than that of any of them. In time of war, they are all of them\nnaturally disposed to muster themselves under his banner, rather than\nunder that of any other person; and his birth and fortune thus naturally\nprocure to him some sort of executive power. By commanding, too, the\nunited force of a greater number of people than any of them, he is best\nable to compel any one of them, who may have injured another, to\ncompensate the wrong. He is the person, therefore, to whom all those who\nare too weak to defend themselves naturally look up for protection. It is\nto him that they naturally complain of the injuries which they imagine\nhave been done to them; and his interposition, in such cases, is more\neasily submitted to, even by the person complained of, than that of any\nother person would be. His birth and fortune thus naturally procure him\nsome sort of judicial authority.\nIt is in the age of shepherds, in the second period of society, that the\ninequality of fortune first begins to take place, and introduces among men\na degree of authority and subordination, which could not possibly exist\nbefore. It thereby introduces some degree of that civil government which\nis indispensably necessary for its own preservation; and it seems to do\nthis naturally, and even independent of the consideration of that\nnecessity. The consideration of that necessity comes, no doubt,\nafterwards, to contribute very much to maintain and secure that authority\nand subordination. The rich, in particular, are necessarily interested to\nsupport that order of things, which can alone secure them in the\npossession of their own advantages. Men of inferior wealth combine to\ndefend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in\norder that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the\npossession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel, that\nthe security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of\nthose of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their\nlesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority; and that upon\ntheir subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in\nsubordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel\nthemselves interested to defend the property, and to support the\nauthority, of their own little sovereign, in order that he may be able to\ndefend their property, and to support their authority. Civil government,\nso far as it is instituted for the security of property, is, in reality,\ninstituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who\nhave some property against those who have none at all.\nThe judicial authority of such a sovereign, however, far from being a\ncause of expense, was, for a long time, a source of revenue to him. The\npersons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for it,\nand a present never failed to accompany a petition. After the authority of\nthe sovereign, too, was thoroughly established, the person found guilty,\nover and above the satisfaction which he was obliged to make to the party,\nwas like-wise forced to pay an amercement to the sovereign. He had given\ntrouble, he had disturbed, he had broke the peace of his lord the king,\nand for those offences an amercement was thought due. In the Tartar\ngovernments of Asia, in the governments of Europe which were founded by\nthe German and Scythian nations who overturned the Roman empire, the\nadministration of justice was a considerable source of revenue, both to\nthe sovereign, and to all the lesser chiefs or lords who exercised under\nhim any particular jurisdiction, either over some particular tribe or\nclan, or over some particular territory or district. Originally, both the\nsovereign and the inferior chiefs used to exercise this jurisdiction in\ntheir own persons. Afterwards, they universally found it convenient to\ndelegate it to some substitute, bailiff, or judge. This substitute,\nhowever, was still obliged to account to his principal or constituent for\nthe profits of the jurisdiction. Whoever reads the instructions (They are\nto be found in Tyrol\u2019s History of England) which were given to the judges\nof the circuit in the time of Henry II will see clearly that those judges\nwere a sort of itinerant factors, sent round the country for the purpose\nof levying certain branches of the king\u2019s revenue. In those days, the\nadministration of justice not only afforded a certain revenue to the\nsovereign, but, to procure this revenue, seems to have been one of the\nprincipal advantages which he proposed to obtain by the administration of\njustice.\nThis scheme of making the administration of justice subservient to the\npurposes of revenue, could scarce fail to be productive of several very\ngross abuses. The person who applied for justice with a large present in\nhis hand, was likely to get something more than justice; while he who\napplied for it with a small one was likely to get something less. Justice,\ntoo, might frequently be delayed, in order that this present might be\nrepeated. The amercement, besides, of the person complained of, might\nfrequently suggest a very strong reason for finding him in the wrong, even\nwhen he had not really been so. That such abuses were far from being\nuncommon, the ancient history of every country in Europe bears witness.\nWhen the sovereign or chief exercises his judicial authority in his own\nperson, how much soever he might abuse it, it must have been scarce\npossible to get any redress; because there could seldom be any body\npowerful enough to call him to account. When he exercised it by a bailiff,\nindeed, redress might sometimes be had. If it was for his own benefit\nonly, that the bailiff had been guilty of an act of injustice, the\nsovereign himself might not always be unwilling to punish him, or to\noblige him to repair the wrong. But if it was for the benefit of his\nsovereign; if it was in order to make court to the person who appointed\nhim, and who might prefer him, that he had committed any act of\noppression; redress would, upon most occasions, be as impossible as if the\nsovereign had committed it himself. In all barbarous governments,\naccordingly, in all those ancient governments of Europe in particular,\nwhich were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the administration\nof justice appears for a long time to have been extremely corrupt; far\nfrom being quite equal and impartial, even under the best monarchs, and\naltogether profligate under the worst.\nAmong nations of shepherds, where the sovereign or chief is only the\ngreatest shepherd or herdsman of the horde or clan, he is maintained in\nthe same manner as any of his vassals or subjects, by the increase of his\nown herds or flocks. Among those nations of husbandmen, who are but just\ncome out of the shepherd state, and who are not much advanced beyond that\nstate, such as the Greek tribes appear to have been about the time of the\nTrojan war, and our German and Scythian ancestors, when they first settled\nupon the ruins of the western empire; the sovereign or chief is, in the\nsame manner, only the greatest landlord of the country, and is maintained\nin the same manner as any other landlord, by a revenue derived from his\nown private estate, or from what, in modern Europe, was called the demesne\nof the crown. His subjects, upon ordinary occasions, contribute nothing to\nhis support, except when, in order to protect them from the oppression of\nsome of their fellow-subjects, they stand in need of his authority. The\npresents which they make him upon such occasions constitute the whole\nordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, except, perhaps, upon\nsome very extraordinary emergencies, he derives from his dominion over\nthem. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles, for his friendship,\nthe sovereignty of seven Greek cities, the sole advantage which he\nmentions as likely to be derived from it was, that the people would honour\nhim with presents. As long as such presents, as long as the emoluments of\njustice, or what may be called the fees of court, constituted, in this\nmanner, the whole ordinary revenue which the sovereign derived from his\nsovereignty, it could not well be expected, it could not even decently be\nproposed, that he should give them up altogether. It might, and it\nfrequently was proposed, that he should regulate and ascertain them. But\nafter they had been so regulated and ascertained, how to hinder a person\nwho was all-powerful from extending them beyond those regulations, was\nstill very difficult, not to say impossible. During the continuance of\nthis state of things, therefore, the corruption of justice, naturally\nresulting from the arbitrary and uncertain nature of those presents,\nscarce admitted of any effectual remedy.\nBut when, from different causes, chiefly from the continually increasing\nexpense of defending the nation against the invasion of other nations, the\nprivate estate of the sovereign had become altogether insufficient for\ndefraying the expense of the sovereignty; and when it had become necessary\nthat the people should, for their own security, contribute towards this\nexpense by taxes of different kinds; it seems to have been very commonly\nstipulated, that no present for the administration of justice should,\nunder any pretence, be accepted either by the sovereign, or by his\nbailiffs and substitutes, the judges. Those presents, it seems to have\nbeen supposed, could more easily be abolished altogether, than effectually\nregulated and ascertained. Fixed salaries were appointed to the judges,\nwhich were supposed to compensate to them the loss of whatever might have\nbeen their share of the ancient emoluments of justice; as the taxes more\nthan compensated to the sovereign the loss of his. Justice was then said\nto be administered gratis.\nJustice, however, never was in reality administered gratis in any country.\nLawyers and attorneys, at least, must always be paid by the parties; and\nif they were not, they would perform their duty still worse than they\nactually perform it. The fees annually paid to lawyers and attorneys,\namount, in every court, to a much greater sum than the salaries of the\njudges. The circumstance of those salaries being paid by the crown, can\nnowhere much diminish the necessary expense of a law-suit. But it was not\nso much to diminish the expense, as to prevent the corruption of justice,\nthat the judges were prohibited from receiving my present or fee from the\nparties.\nThe office of judge is in itself so very honourable, that men are willing\nto accept of it, though accompanied with very small emoluments. The\ninferior office of justice of peace, though attended with a good deal of\ntrouble, and in most cases with no emoluments at all, is an object of\nambition to the greater part of our country gentlemen. The salaries of all\nthe different judges, high and low, together with the whole expense of the\nadministration and execution of justice, even where it is not managed with\nvery good economy, makes, in any civilized country, but a very\ninconsiderable part of the whole expense of government.\nThe whole expense of justice, too, might easily be defrayed by the fees of\ncourt; and, without exposing the administration of justice to any real\nhazard of corruption, the public revenue might thus be entirely discharged\nfrom a certain, though perhaps but a small incumbrance. It is difficult to\nregulate the fees of court effectually, where a person so powerful as the\nsovereign is to share in them and to derive any considerable part of his\nrevenue from them. It is very easy, where the judge is the principal\nperson who can reap any benefit from them. The law can very easily oblige\nthe judge to respect the regulation though it might not always be able to\nmake the sovereign respect it. Where the fees of court are precisely\nregulated and ascertained where they are paid all at once, at a certain\nperiod of every process, into the hands of a cashier or receiver, to be by\nhim distributed in certain known proportions among the different judges\nafter the process is decided and not till it is decided; there seems to be\nno more danger of corruption than when such fees are prohibited\naltogether. Those fees, without occasioning any considerable increase in\nthe expense of a law-suit, might be rendered fully sufficient for\ndefraying the whole expense of justice. But not being paid to the judges\ntill the process was determined, they might be some incitement to the\ndiligence of the court in examining and deciding it. In courts which\nconsisted of a considerable number of judges, by proportioning the share\nof each judge to the number of hours and days which he had employed in\nexamining the process, either in the court, or in a committee, by order of\nthe court, those fees might give some encouragement to the diligence of\neach particular judge. Public services are never better performed, than\nwhen their reward comes only in consequence of their being performed, and\nis proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them. In the\ndifferent parliaments of France, the fees of court (called epices and\nvacations) constitute the far greater part of the emoluments of the\njudges. After all deductions are made, the neat salary paid by the crown\nto a counsellor or judge in the parliament of Thoulouse, in rank and\ndignity the second parliament of the kingdom, amounts only to 150 livres,\nabout \u00a36:11s. sterling a-year. About seven years ago, that sum was in the\nsame place the ordinary yearly wages of a common footman. The distribution\nof these epices, too, is according to the diligence of the judges. A\ndiligent judge gains a comfortable, though moderate revenue, by his\noffice; an idle one gets little more than his salary. Those parliaments\nare, perhaps, in many respects, not very convenient courts of justice; but\nthey have never been accused; they seem never even to have been suspected\nof corruption.\nThe fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of\nthe different courts of justice in England. Each court endeavoured to draw\nto itself as much business as it could, and was, upon that account,\nwilling to take cognizance of many suits which were not originally\nintended to fall under its jurisdiction. The court of king\u2019s bench,\ninstituted for the trial of criminal causes only, took cognizance of civil\nsuits; the plaintiff pretending that the defendant, in not doing him\njustice, had been guilty of some trespass or misdemeanour. The court of\nexchequer, instituted for the levying of the king\u2019s revenue, and for\nenforcing the payment of such debts only as were due to the king, took\ncognizance of all other contract debts; the planitiff alleging that he\ncould not pay the king, because the defendant would not pay him. In\nconsequence of such fictions, it came, in many cases, to depend altogether\nupon the parties, before what court they would choose to have their cause\ntried, and each court endeavoured, by superior dispatch and impartiality,\nto draw to itself as many causes as it could. The present admirable\nconstitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps, originally,\nin a great measure, formed by this emulation, which anciently took place\nbetween their respective judges: each judge endeavouring to give, in his\nown court, the speediest and most effectual remedy which the law would\nadmit, for every sort of injustice. Originally, the courts of law gave\ndamages only for breach of contract. The court of chancery, as a court of\nconscience, first took upon it to enforce the specific performance of\nagreements. When the breach of contract consisted in the non-payment of\nmoney, the damage sustained could be compensated in no other way than by\nordering payment, which was equivalent to a specific performance of the\nagreement. In such cases, therefore, the remedy of the courts of law was\nsufficient. It was not so in others. When the tenant sued his lord for\nhaving unjustly outed him of his lease, the damages which he recovered\nwere by no means equivalent to the possession of the land. Such causes,\ntherefore, for some time, went all to the court of chancery, to the no\nsmall loss of the courts of law. It was to draw back such causes to\nthemselves, that the courts of law are said to have invented the\nartificial and fictitious writ of ejectment, the most effectual remedy for\nan unjust outer or dispossession of land.\nA stamp-duty upon the law proceedings of each particular court, to be\nlevied by that court, and applied towards the maintenance of the judges,\nand other officers belonging to it, might in the same manner, afford a\nrevenue sufficient for defraying the expense of the administration of\njustice, without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the\nsociety. The judges, indeed, might in this case, be under the temptation\nof multiplying unnecessarily the proceedings upon every cause, in order to\nincrease, as much as possible, the produce of such a stamp-duty. It has\nbeen the custom in modern Europe to regulate, upon most occasions, the\npayment of the attorneys and clerks of court according to the number of\npages which they had occasion to write; the court, however, requiring that\neach page should contain so many lines, and each line so many words. In\norder to increase their payment, the attorneys and clerks have contrived\nto multiply words beyond all necessity, to the corruption of the law\nlanguage of, I believe, every court of justice in Europe. A like\ntemptation might, perhaps, occasion a like corruption in the form of law\nproceedings.\nBut whether the administration of justice be so contrived as to defray its\nown expense, or whether the judges be maintained by fixed salaries paid to\nthem from some other fund, it does not seen necessary that the person or\npersons entrusted with the executive power should be charged with the\nmanagement of that fund, or with the payment of those salaries. That fund\nmight arise from the rent of landed estates, the management of each estate\nbeing entrusted to the particular court which was to be maintained by it.\nThat fund might arise even from the interest of a sum of money, the\nlending out of which might, in the same manner, be entrusted to the court\nwhich was to be maintained by it. A part, though indeed but a small part\nof the salary of the judges of the court of session in Scotland, arises\nfrom the interest of a sum of money. The necessary instability of such a\nfund seems, however, to render it an improper one for the maintenance of\nan institution which ought to last for ever.\nThe separation of the judicial from the executive power, seems originally\nto have arisen from the increasing business of the society, in consequence\nof its increasing improvement. The administration of justice became so\nlaborious and so complicated a duty, as to require the undivided attention\nof the person to whom it was entrusted. The person entrusted with the\nexecutive power, not having leisure to attend to the decision of private\ncauses himself, a deputy was appointed to decide them in his stead. In the\nprogress of the Roman greatness, the consul was too much occupied with the\npolitical affairs of the state, to attend to the administration of\njustice. A praetor, therefore, was appointed to administer it in his\nstead. In the progress of the European monarchies, which were founded upon\nthe ruins of the Roman empire, the sovereigns and the great lords came\nuniversally to consider the administration of justice as an office both\ntoo laborious and too ignoble for them to execute in their own persons.\nThey universally, therefore, discharged themselves of it, by appointing a\ndeputy, bailiff or judge.\nWhen the judicial is united to the executive power, it is scarce possible\nthat justice should not frequently be sacrificed to what is vulgarly\ncalled politics. The persons entrusted with the great interests of the\nstate may even without any corrupt views, sometimes imagine it necessary\nto sacrifice to those interests the rights of a private man. But upon the\nimpartial administration of justice depends the liberty of every\nindividual, the sense which he has of his own security. In order to make\nevery individual feel himself perfectly secure in the possession of every\nright which belongs to him, it is not only necessary that the judicial\nshould be separated from the executive power, but that it should be\nrendered as much as possible independent of that power. The judge should\nnot be liable to be removed from his office according to the caprice of\nthat power. The regular payment of his salary should not depend upon the\ngood will, or even upon the good economy of that power.\nPART III. Of the Expense of public Works and public Institutions.\nThe third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth, is that of\nerecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works,\nwhich though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great\nsociety, are, however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay\nthe expense to any individual, or small number of individuals; and which\nit, therefore, cannot be expected that any individual, or small number of\nindividuals, should erect or maintain. The performance of this duty\nrequires, too, very different degrees of expense in the different periods\nof society.\nAfter the public institutions and public works necessary for the defence\nof the society, and for the administration of justice, both of which have\nalready been mentioned, the other works and institutions of this kind are\nchiefly for facilitating the commerce of the society, and those for\npromoting the instruction of the people. The institutions for instruction\nare of two kinds: those for the education of the youth, and those for the\ninstruction of people of all ages. The consideration of the manner in\nwhich the expense of those different sorts of public works and\ninstitutions may be most properly defrayed will divide this third part of\nthe present chapter into three different articles.\nARTICLE I.\u2014Of the public Works and Institutions for facilitating the\nCommerce of the Society.\nAnd, first, of those which are necessary for facilitating Commerce in\ngeneral.\nThat the erection and maintenance of the public works which facilitate the\ncommerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges, navigable canals,\nharbours, etc. must require very different degrees of expense in the\ndifferent periods of society, is evident without any proof. The expense of\nmaking and maintaining the public roads of any country must evidently\nincrease with the annual produce of the land and labour of that country,\nor with the quantity and weight of the goods which it becomes necessary to\nfetch and carry upon those roads. The strength of a bridge must be suited\nto the number and weight of the carriages which are likely to pass over\nit. The depth and the supply of water for a navigable canal must be\nproportioned to the number and tonnage of the lighters which are likely to\ncarry goods upon it; the extent of a harbour, to the number of the\nshipping which are likely to take shelter in it.\nIt does not seem necessary that the expense of those public works should\nbe defrayed from that public revenue, as it is commonly called, of which\nthe collection and application are in most countries, assigned to the\nexecutive power. The greater part of such public works may easily be so\nmanaged, as to afford a particular revenue, sufficient for defraying their\nown expense without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the\nsociety.\nA highway, a bridge, a navigable canal, for example, may, in most cases,\nbe both made add maintained by a small toll upon the carriages which make\nuse of them; a harbour, by a moderate port-duty upon the tonnage of the\nshipping which load or unload in it. The coinage, another institution for\nfacilitating commerce, in many countries, not only defrays its own\nexpense, but affords a small revenue or a seignorage to the sovereign. The\npost-office, another institution for the same purpose, over and above\ndefraying its own expense, affords, in almost all countries, a very\nconsiderable revenue to the sovereign.\nWhen the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge, and the lighters\nwhich sail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to their weight\nor their tonnage, they pay for the maintenance of those public works\nexactly in proportion to the wear and tear which they occasion of them. It\nseems scarce possible to invent a more equitable way of maintaining such\nworks. This tax or toll, too, though it is advanced by the carrier, is\nfinally paid by the consumer, to whom it must always be charged in the\nprice of the goods. As the expense of carriage, however, is very much\nreduced by means of such public works, the goods, notwithstanding the\ntoll, come cheaper to the consumer than they could otherwise have done,\ntheir price not being so much raised by the toll, as it is lowered by the\ncheapness of the carriage. The person who finally pays this tax,\ntherefore, gains by the application more than he loses by the payment of\nit. His payment is exactly in proportion to his gain. It is, in reality,\nno more than a part of that gain which he is obliged to give up, in order\nto get the rest. It seems impossible to imagine a more equitable method of\nraising a tax. When the toll upon carriages of luxury, upon coaches,\npost-chaises, etc. is made somewhat higher in proportion to their weight,\nthan upon carriages of necessary use, such as carts, waggons, etc. the\nindolence and vanity of the rich is made to contribute, in a very easy\nmanner, to the relief of the poor, by rendering cheaper the transportation\nof heavy goods to all the different parts of the country.\nWhen high-roads, bridges, canals, etc. are in this manner made and\nsupported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them, they can\nbe made only where that commerce requires them, and, consequently, where\nit is proper to make them. Their expense, too, their grandeur and\nmagnificence, must be suited to what that commerce can afford to pay. They\nmust be made, consequently, as it is proper to make them. A magnificent\nhigh-road cannot be made through a desert country, where there is little\nor no commerce, or merely because it happens to lead to the country villa\nof the intendant of the province, or to that of some great lord, to whom\nthe intendant finds it convenient to make his court. A great bridge cannot\nbe thrown over a river at a place where nobody passes, or merely to\nembellish the view from the windows of a neighbouring palace; things which\nsometimes happen in countries, where works of this kind are carried on by\nany other revenue than that which they themselves are capable of\naffording.\nIn several different parts of Europe, the toll or lock-duty upon a canal\nis the property of private persons, whose private interest obliges them to\nkeep up the canal. If it is not kept in tolerable order, the navigation\nnecessarily ceases altogether, and, along with it, the whole profit which\nthey can make by the tolls. If those tolls were put under the management\nof commissioners, who had themselves no interest in them, they might be\nless attentive to the maintenance of the works which produced them. The\ncanal of Languedoc cost the king of France and the province upwards of\nthirteen millions of livres, which (at twenty-eight livres the mark of\nsilver, the value of French money in the end of the last century) amounted\nto upwards of nine hundred thousand pounds sterling. When that great work\nwas finished, the most likely method, it was found, of keeping it in\nconstant repair, was to make a present of the tolls to Riquet, the\nengineer who planned and conducted the work. Those tolls constitute, at\npresent, a very large estate to the different branches of the family of\nthat gentleman, who have, therefore, a great interest to keep the work in\nconstant repair. But had those tolls been put under the management of\ncommissioners, who had no such interest, they might perhaps, have been\ndissipated in ornamental and unnecessary expenses, while the most\nessential parts of the works were allowed to go to ruin.\nThe tolls for the maintenance of a highroad cannot, with any safety, be\nmade the property of private persons. A high-road, though entirely\nneglected, does not become altogether impassable, though a canal does. The\nproprietors of the tolls upon a high-road, therefore, might neglect\naltogether the repair of the road, and yet continue to levy very nearly\nthe same tolls. It is proper, therefore, that the tolls for the\nmaintenance of such a work should be put under the management of\ncommissioners or trustees.\nIn Great Britain, the abuses which the trustees have committed in the\nmanagement of those tolls, have, in many cases, been very justly\ncomplained of. At many turnpikes, it has been said, the money levied is\nmore than double of what is necessary for executing, in the completest\nmanner, the work, which is often executed in a very slovenly manner, and\nsometimes not executed at all. The system of repairing the high-roads by\ntolls of this kind, it must be observed, is not of very long standing. We\nshould not wonder, therefore, if it has not yet been brought to that\ndegree of perfection of which it seems capable. If mean and improper\npersons are frequently appointed trustees; and if proper courts of\ninspection and account have not yet been established for controlling their\nconduct, and for reducing the tolls to what is barely sufficient for\nexecuting the work to be done by them; the recency of the institution both\naccounts and apologizes for those defects, of which, by the wisdom of\nparliament, the greater part may, in due time, be gradually remedied.\nThe money levied at the different turnpikes in Great Britain, is supposed\nto exceed so much what is necessary for repairing the roads, that the\nsavings which, with proper economy, might be made from it, have been\nconsidered, even by some ministers, as a very great resource, which might,\nat some time or another, be applied to the exigencies of the state.\nGovernment, it has been said, by taking the management of the turnpikes\ninto its own hands, and by employing the soldiers, who would work for a\nvery small addition to their pay, could keep the roads in good order, at a\nmuch less expense than it can be done by trustees, who have no other\nworkmen to employ, but such as derive their whole subsistence from their\nwages. A great revenue, half a million, perhaps {Since publishing the two\nfirst editions of this book, I have got good reasons to believe that all\nthe turnpike tolls levied in Great Britain do not produce a neat revenue\nthat amounts to half a million; a sum which, under the management of\ngovernment, would not be sufficient to keep in repair five of the\nprincipal roads in the kingdom}, it has been pretended, might in this\nmanner be gained, without laying any new burden upon the people; and the\nturnpike roads might be made to contribute to the general expense of the\nstate, in the same manner as the post-office does at present.\nThat a considerable revenue might be gained in this manner, I have no\ndoubt, though probably not near so much as the projectors of this plan\nhave supposed. The plan itself, however, seems liable to several very\nimportant objections.\nFirst, If the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes should ever be\nconsidered as one of the resources for supplying the exigencies of the\nstate, they would certainly be augmented as those exigencies were supposed\nto require. According to the policy of Great Britain, therefore, they\nwould probably he augmented very fast. The facility with which a great\nrevenue could be drawn from them, would probably encourage administration\nto recur very frequently te this resource. Though it may, perhaps, be more\nthan doubtful whether half a million could by any economy be saved out of\nthe present tolls, it can scarcely be doubted, but that a million might be\nsaved out of them, if they were doubled; and perhaps two millions, if they\nwere tripled {I have now good reason to believe that all these conjectural\nsums are by much too large.}. This great revenue, too, might be levied\nwithout the appointment of a single new officer to collect and receive it.\nBut the turnpike tolls, being continually augmented in this manner,\ninstead of facilitating the inland commerce of the country, as at present,\nwould soon become a very great incumbrance upon it. The expense of\ntransporting all heavy goods from one part of the country to another,\nwould soon be so much increased, the market for all such goods,\nconsequently, would soon be so much narrowed, that their production would\nbe in a great measure discouraged, and the most important branches of the\ndomestic industry of the country annihilated altogether.\nSecondly, A tax upon carriages, in proportion to their weight, though a\nvery equal tax when applied to the sole purpose of repairing the roads, is\na very unequal one when applied to any other purpose, or to supply the\ncommon exigencies of the state. When it is applied to the sole purpose\nabove mentioned, each carriage is supposed to pay exactly for the wear and\ntear which that carriage occasions of the roads. But when it is applied to\nany other purpose, each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that\nwear and tear, and contributes to the supply of some other exigency of the\nstate. But as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in proportion to\ntheir weight and not to their value, it is chiefly paid by the consumers\nof coarse and bulky, not by those of precious and light commodities.\nWhatever exigency of the state, therefore, this tax might be intended to\nsupply, that exigency would be chiefly supplied at the expense of the\npoor, not of the rich; at the expense of those who are least able to\nsupply it, not of those who are most able.\nThirdly, If government should at any time neglect the reparation of the\nhigh-roads, it would be still more difficult, than it is at present, to\ncompel the proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls. A large\nrevenue might thus be levied upon the people, without any part of it being\napplied to the only purpose to which a revenue levied in this manner ought\never to be applied. If the meanness and poverty of the trustees of\nturnpike roads render it sometimes difficult, at present, to oblige them\nto repair their wrong; their wealth and greatness would render it ten\ntimes more so in the case which is here supposed.\nIn France, the funds destined for the reparation of the high-roads are\nunder the immediate direction of the executive power. Those funds consist,\npartly in a certain number of days labour, which the country people are in\nmost parts of Europe obliged to give to the reparation of the highways;\nand partly in such a portion of the general revenue of the state as the\nking chooses to spare from his other expenses.\nBy the ancient law of France, as well as by that of most other parts of\nEurope, the labour of the country people was under the direction of a\nlocal or provincial magistracy, which had no immediate dependency upon the\nking\u2019s council. But, by the present practice, both the labour of the\ncountry people, and whatever other fund the king may choose to assign for\nthe reparation of the high-roads in any particular province or generality,\nare entirely under the management of the intendant; an officer who is\nappointed and removed by the king\u2019s council who receives his orders from\nit, and is in constant correspondence with it. In the progress of\ndespotism, the authority of the executive power gradually absorbs that of\nevery other power in the state, and assumes to itself the management of\nevery branch of revenue which is destined for any public purpose. In\nFrance, however, the great post-roads, the roads which make the\ncommunication between the principal towns of the kingdom, are in general\nkept in good order; and, in some provinces, are even a good deal superior\nto the greater part of the turnpike roads of England. But what we call the\ncross roads, that is, the far greater part of the roads in the country,\nare entirely neglected, and are in many places absolutely impassable for\nany heavy carriage. In some places it is even dangerous to travel on\nhorseback, and mules are the only conveyance which can safely be trusted.\nThe proud minister of an ostentatious court, may frequently take pleasure\nin executing a work of splendour and magnificence, such as a great\nhighway, which is frequently seen by the principal nobility, whose\napplauses not only flatter his vanity, but even contribute to support his\ninterest at court. But to execute a great number of little works, in which\nnothing that can be done can make any great appearance, or excite the\nsmallest degree of admiration in any traveller, and which, in short, have\nnothing to recommend them but their extreme utility, is a business which\nappears, in every respect, too mean and paltry to merit the attention of\nso great a magistrate. Under such an administration therefore, such works\nare almost always entirely neglected.\nIn China, and in several other governments of Asia, the executive power\ncharges itself both with the reparation of the high-roads, and with the\nmaintenance of the navigable canals. In the instructions which are given\nto the governor of each province, those objects, it is said, are\nconstantly recommended to him, and the judgment which the court forms of\nhis conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to\nhave paid to this part of his instructions. This branch of public police,\naccordingly, is said to be very much attended to in all those countries,\nbut particularly in China, where the high-roads, and still more the\nnavigable canals, it is pretended, exceed very much every thing of the\nsame kind which is known in Europe. The accounts of those works, however,\nwhich have been transmitted to Europe, have generally been drawn up by\nweak and wondering travellers; frequently by stupid and lying\nmissionaries. If they had been examined by more intelligent eyes, and if\nthe accounts of them had been reported by more faithful witnesses, they\nwould not, perhaps, appear to be so wonderful. The account which Bernier\ngives of some works of this kind in Indostan, falls very short of what had\nbeen reported of them by other travellers, more disposed to the marvellous\nthan he was. It may too, perhaps, be in those countries, as it is in\nFrance, where the great roads, the great communications, which are likely\nto be the subjects of conversation at the court and in the capital, are\nattended to, and all the rest neglected. In China, besides, in Indostan,\nand in several other governments of Asia, the revenue of the sovereign\narises almost altogether from a land tax or land rent, which rises or\nfalls with the rise and fall of the annual produce of the land. The great\ninterest of the sovereign, therefore, his revenue, is in such countries\nnecessarily and immediately connected with the cultivation of the land,\nwith the greatness of its produce, and with the value of its produce. But\nin order to render that produce both as great and as valuable as possible,\nit is necessary to procure to it as extensive a market as possible, and\nconsequently to establish the freest, the easiest, and the least expensive\ncommunication between all the different parts of the country; which can be\ndone only by means of the best roads and the best navigable canals. But\nthe revenue of the sovereign does not, in any part of Europe, arise\nchiefly from a land tax or land rent. In all the great kingdoms of Europe,\nperhaps, the greater part of it may ultimately depend upon the produce of\nthe land: but that dependency is neither so immediate nor so evident. In\nEurope, therefore, the sovereign does not feel himself so directly called\nupon to promote the increase, both in quantity and value of the produce of\nthe land, or, by maintaining good roads and canals, to provide the most\nextensive market for that produce. Though it should be true, therefore,\nwhat I apprehend is not a little doubtful, that in some parts of Asia this\ndepartment of the public police is very properly managed by the executive\npower, there is not the least probability that, during the present state\nof things, it could be tolerably managed by that power in any part of\nEurope.\nEven those public works, which are of such a nature that they cannot\nafford any revenue for maintaining themselves, but of which the\nconveniency is nearly confined to some particular place or district, are\nalways better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the\nmanagement of a local and provincial administration, than by the general\nrevenue of the state, of which the executive power must always have the\nmanagement. Were the streets of London to be lighted and paved at the\nexpense of the treasury, is there any probability that they would be so\nwell lighted and paved as they are at present, or even at so small an\nexpense? The expense, besides, instead of being raised by a local tax upon\nthe inhabitants of each particular street, parish, or district in London,\nwould, in this case, be defrayed out of the general revenue of the state,\nand would consequently be raised by a tax upon all the inhabitants of the\nkingdom, of whom the greater part derive no sort of benefit from the\nlighting and paving of the streets of London.\nThe abuses which sometimes creep into the local and provincial\nadministration of a local and provincial revenue, how enormous soever they\nmay appear, are in reality, however, almost always very trifling in\ncomparison of those which commonly take place in the administration and\nexpenditure of the revenue of a great empire. They are, besides, much more\neasily corrected. Under the local or provincial administration of the\njustices of the peace in Great Britain, the six days labour which the\ncountry people are obliged to give to the reparation of the highways, is\nnot always, perhaps, very judiciously applied, but it is scarce ever\nexacted with any circumstance of cruelty or oppression. In France, under\nthe administration of the intendants, the application is not always more\njudicious, and the exaction is frequently the most cruel and oppressive.\nSuch corvees, as they are called, make one of the principal instruments of\ntyranny by which those officers chastise any parish or communeaute, which\nhas had the misfortune to fall under their displeasure.\nOf the public Works and Institution which are necessary for facilitating\nparticular Branches of Commerce.\nThe object of the public works and institutions above mentioned, is to\nfacilitate commerce in general. But in order to facilitate some particular\nbranches of it, particular institutions are necessary, which again require\na particular and extraordinary expense.\nSome particular branches of commerce which are carried on with barbarous\nand uncivilized nations, require extraordinary protection. An ordinary\nstore or counting-house could give little security to the goods of the\nmerchants who trade to the western coast of Africa. To defend them from\nthe barbarous natives, it is necessary that the place where they are\ndeposited should be in some measure fortified. The disorders in the\ngovernment of Indostan have been supposed to render a like precaution\nnecessary, even among that mild and gentle people; and it was under\npretence of securing their persons and property from violence, that both\nthe English and French East India companies were allowed to erect the\nfirst forts which they possessed in that country. Among other nations,\nwhose vigorous government will suffer no strangers to possess any\nfortified place within their territory, it may be necessary to maintain\nsome ambassador, minister, or consul, who may both decide, according to\ntheir own customs, the differences arising among his own countrymen, and,\nin their disputes with the natives, may by means of his public character,\ninterfere with more authority and afford them a more powerful protection\nthan they could expect from any private man. The interests of commerce\nhave frequently made it necessary to maintain ministers in foreign\ncountries, where the purposes either of war or alliance would not have\nrequired any. The commerce of the Turkey company first occasioned the\nestablishment of an ordinary ambassador at Constantinople. The first\nEnglish embassies to Russia arose altogether from commercial interests.\nThe constant interference with those interests, necessarily occasioned\nbetween the subjects of the different states of Europe, has probably\nintroduced the custom of keeping, in all neighbouring countries,\nambassadors or ministers constantly resident, even in the time of peace.\nThis custom, unknown to ancient times, seems not to be older than the end\nof the fifteenth, or beginning of the sixteenth century; that is, than the\ntime when commerce first began to extend itself to the greater part of the\nnations of Europe, and when they first began to attend to its interests.\nIt seems not unreasonable, that the extraordinary expense which the\nprotection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion, should be\ndefrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch; by a moderate\nfine, for example, to be paid by the traders when they first enter into\nit; or, what is more equal, by a particular duty of so much per cent. upon\nthe goods which they either import into, or export out of, the particular\ncountries with which it is carried on. The protection of trade, in\ngeneral, from pirates and freebooters, is said to have given occasion to\nthe first institution of the duties of customs. But, if it was thought\nreasonable to lay a general tax upon trade, in order to defray the expense\nof protecting trade in general, it should seem equally reasonable to lay a\nparticular tax upon a particular branch of trade, in order to defray the\nextraordinary expense of protecting that branch.\nThe protection of trade, in general, has always been considered as\nessential to the defence of the commonwealth, and, upon that account, a\nnecessary part of the duty of the executive power. The collection and\napplication of the general duties of customs, therefore, have always been\nleft to that power. But the protection of any particular branch of trade\nis a part of the general protection of trade; a part, therefore, of the\nduty of that power; and if nations always acted consistently, the\nparticular duties levied for the purposes of such particular protection,\nshould always have been left equally to its disposal. But in this respect,\nas well as in many others, nations have not always acted consistently; and\nin the greater part of the commercial states of Europe, particular\ncompanies of merchants have had the address to persuade the legislature to\nentrust to them the performance of this part of the duty of the sovereign,\ntogether with all the powers which are necessarily connected with it.\nThese companies, though they may, perhaps, have been useful for the first\nintroduction of some branches of commerce, by making, at their own\nexpense, an experiment which the state might not think it prudent to make,\nhave in the long-run proved, universally, either burdensome or useless,\nand have either mismanaged or confined the trade.\nWhen those companies do not trade upon a joint stock, but are obliged to\nadmit any person, properly qualified, upon paying a certain fine, and\nagreeing to submit to the regulations of the company, each member trading\nupon his own stock, and at his own risk, they are called regulated\ncompanies. When they trade upon a joint stock, each member sharing in the\ncommon profit or loss, in proportion to his share in this stock, they are\ncalled joint-stock companies. Such companies, whether regulated or\njoint-stock, sometimes have, and sometimes have not, exclusive privileges.\nRegulated companies resemble, in every respect, the corporation of trades,\nso common in the cities and towns of all the different countries of\nEurope; and are a sort of enlarged monopolies of the same kind. As no\ninhabitant of a town can exercise an incorporated trade, without first\nobtaining his freedom in the incorporation, so, in most cases, no subject\nof the state can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign trade, for which\na regulated company is established, without first becoming a member of\nthat company. The monopoly is more or less strict, according as the terms\nof admission are more or less difficult, and according as the directors of\nthe company have more or less authority, or have it more or less in their\npower to manage in such a manner as to confine the greater part of the\ntrade to themselves and their particular friends. In the most ancient\nregulated companies, the privileges of apprenticeship were the same as in\nother corporations, and entitled the person who had served his time to a\nmember of the company, to become himself a member, either without paying\nany fine, or upon paying a much smaller one than what was exacted of other\npeople. The usual corporation spirit, wherever the law does not restrain\nit, prevails in all regulated companies. When they have been allowed to\nact according to their natural genius, they have always, in order to\nconfine the competition to as small a number of persons as possible,\nendeavoured to subject the trade to many burdensome regulations. When the\nlaw has restrained them from doing this, they have become altogether\nuseless and insignificant.\nThe regulated companies for foreign commerce which at present subsist in\nGreat Britain, are the ancient merchant-adventurers company, now commonly\ncalled the Hamburgh company, the Russia company, the Eastland company, the\nTurkey company, and the African company.\nThe terms of admission into the Hamburgh company are now said to be quite\neasy; and the directors either have it not in their power to subject the\ntrade to any troublesome restraint or regulations, or, at least, have not\nof late exercised that power. It has not always been so. About the middle\nof the last century, the fine for admission was fifty, and at one time one\nhundred pounds, and the conduct of the company was said to be extremely\noppressive. In 1643, in 1645, and in 1661, the clothiers and free traders\nof the west of England complained of them to parliament, as of\nmonopolists, who confined the trade, and oppressed the manufactures of the\ncountry. Though those complaints produced no act of parliament, they had\nprobably intimidated the company so far, as to oblige them to reform their\nconduct. Since that time, at least, there have been no complaints against\nthem. By the 10th and 11th of William III. c.6, the fine for admission\ninto the Russia company was reduced to five pounds; and by the 25th of\nCharles II. c.7, that for admission into the Eastland company to forty\nshillings; while, at the same time, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, all the\ncountries on the north side of the Baltic, were exempted from their\nexclusive charter. The conduct of those companies had probably given\noccasion to those two acts of parliament. Before that time, Sir Josiah\nChild had represented both these and the Hamburgh company as extremely\noppressive, and imputed to their bad management the low state of the\ntrade, which we at that time carried on to the countries comprehended\nwithin their respective charters. But though such companies may not, in\nthe present times, be very oppressive, they are certainly altogether\nuseless. To be merely useless, indeed, is perhaps, the highest eulogy\nwhich can ever justly be bestowed upon a regulated company; and all the\nthree companies above mentioned seem, in their present state, to deserve\nthis eulogy.\nThe fine for admission into the Turkey company was formerly twenty-five\npounds for all persons under twenty-six years of age, and fifty pounds for\nall persons above that age. Nobody but mere merchants could be admitted; a\nrestriction which excluded all shop-keepers and retailers. By a bye-law,\nno British manufactures could be exported to Turkey but in the general\nships of the company; and as those ships sailed always from the port of\nLondon, this restriction confined the trade to that expensive port, and\nthe traders to those who lived in London and in its neighbourhood. By\nanother bye-law, no person living within twenty miles of London, and not\nfree of the city, could be admitted a member; another restriction which,\njoined to the foregoing, necessarily excluded all but the freemen of\nLondon. As the time for the loading and sailing of those general ships\ndepended altogether upon the directors, they could easily fill them with\ntheir own goods, and those of their particular friends, to the exclusion\nof others, who, they might pretend, had made their proposals too late. In\nthis state of things, therefore, this company was, in every respect, a\nstrict and oppressive monopoly. Those abuses gave occasion to the act of\nthe 26th of George II. c. 18, reducing the fine for admission to twenty\npounds for all persons, without any distinction of ages, or any\nrestriction, either to mere merchants, or to the freemen of London; and\ngranting to all such persons the liberty of exporting, from all the ports\nof Great Britain, to any port in Turkey, all British goods, of which the\nexportation was not prohibited, upon paying both the general duties of\ncustoms, and the particular duties assessed for defraying the necessary\nexpenses of the company; and submitting, at the same time, to the lawful\nauthority of the British ambassador and consuls resident in Turkey, and to\nthe bye-laws of the company duly enacted. To prevent any oppression by\nthose bye-laws, it was by the same act ordained, that if any seven members\nof the company conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which should\nbe enacted after the passing of this act, they might appeal to the board\nof trade and plantations (to the authority of which a committee of the\nprivy council has now succeeded), provided such appeal was brought within\ntwelve months after the bye-law was enacted; and that, if any seven\nmembers conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which had been\nenacted before the passing of this act, they might bring a like appeal,\nprovided it was within twelve months after the day on which this act was\nto take place. The experience of one year, however, may not always be\nsufficient to discover to all the members of a great company the\npernicious tendency of a particular bye-law; and if several of them should\nafterwards discover it, neither the board of trade, nor the committee of\ncouncil, can afford them any redress. The object, besides, of the greater\npart of the bye-laws of all regulated companies, as well as of all other\ncorporations, is not so much to oppress those who are already members, as\nto discourage others from becoming so; which may be done, not only by a\nhigh fine, but by many other contrivances. The constant view of such\ncompanies is always to raise the rate of their own profit as high as they\ncan; to keep the market, both for the goods which they export, and for\nthose which they import, as much understocked as they can; which can be\ndone only by restraining the competition, or by discouraging new\nadventurers from entering into the trade. A fine, even of twenty pounds,\nbesides, though it may not, perhaps, be sufficient to discourage any man\nfrom entering into the Turkey trade, with an intention to continue in it,\nmay be enough to discourage a speculative merchant from hazarding a single\nadventure in it. In all trades, the regular established traders, even\nthough not incorporated, naturally combine to raise profits, which are\nnoway so likely to be kept, at all times, down to their proper level, as\nby the occasional competition of speculative adventurers. The Turkey\ntrade, though in some measure laid open by this act of parliament, is\nstill considered by many people as very far from being altogether free.\nThe Turkey company contribute to maintain an ambassador and two or three\nconsuls, who, like other public ministers, ought to be maintained\naltogether by the state, and the trade laid open to all his majesty\u2019s\nsubjects. The different taxes levied by the company, for this and other\ncorporation purposes, might afford a revenue much more than sufficient to\nenable a state to maintain such ministers.\nRegulated companies, it was observed by Sir Josiah Child, though they had\nfrequently supported public ministers, had never maintained any forts or\ngarrisons in the countries to which they traded; whereas joint-stock\ncompanies frequently had. And, in reality, the former seem to be much more\nunfit for this sort of service than the latter. First, the directors of a\nregulated company have no particular interest in the prosperity of the\ngeneral trade of the company, for the sake of which such forts and\ngarrisons are maintained. The decay of that general trade may even\nfrequently contribute to the advantage of their own private trade; as, by\ndiminishing the number of their competitors, it may enable them both to\nbuy cheaper, and to sell dearer. The directors of a joint-stock company,\non the contrary, having only their share in the profits which are made\nupon the common stock committed to their management, have no private trade\nof their own, of which the interest can be separated from that of the\ngeneral trade of the company. Their private interest is connected with the\nprosperity of the general trade of the company, and with the maintenance\nof the forts and garrisons which are necessary for its defence. They are\nmore likely, therefore, to have that continual and careful attention which\nthat maintenance necessarily requires. Secondly, The directors of a\njoint-stock company have always the management of a large capital, the\njoint stock of the company, a part of which they may frequently employ,\nwith propriety, in building, repairing, and maintaining such necessary\nforts and garrisons. But the directors of a regulated company, having the\nmanagement of no common capital, have no other fund to employ in this way,\nbut the casual revenue arising from the admission fines, and from the\ncorporation duties imposed upon the trade of the company. Though they had\nthe same interest, therefore, to attend to the maintenance of such forts\nand garrisons, they can seldom have the same ability to render that\nattention effectual. The maintenance of a public minister, requiring\nscarce any attention, and but a moderate and limited expense, is a\nbusiness much more suitable both to the temper and abilities of a\nregulated company.\nLong after the time of Sir Josiah Child, however, in 1750, a regulated\ncompany was established, the present company of merchants trading to\nAfrica; which was expressly charged at first with the maintenance of all\nthe British forts and garrisons that lie between Cape Blanc and the Cape\nof Good Hope, and afterwards with that of those only which lie between\nCape Rouge and the Cape of Good Hope. The act which establishes this\ncompany (the 23rd of George II. c.51 ), seems to have had two distinct\nobjects in view; first, to restrain effectually the oppressive and\nmonopolizing spirit which is natural to the directors of a regulated\ncompany; and, secondly, to force them, as much as possible, to give an\nattention, which is not natural to them, towards the maintenance of forts\nand garrisons.\nFor the first of these purposes, the fine for admission is limited to\nforty shillings. The company is prohibited from trading in their corporate\ncapacity, or upon a joint stock; from borrowing money upon common seal, or\nfrom laying any restraints upon the trade, which may be carried on freely\nfrom all places, and by all persons being British subjects, and paying the\nfine. The government is in a committee of nine persons, who meet at\nLondon, but who are chosen annually by the freemen of the company at\nLondon, Bristol, and Liverpool; three from each place. No committeeman can\nbe continued in office for more than three years together. Any\ncommittee-man might be removed by the board of trade and plantations, now\nby a committee of council, after being heard in his own defence. The\ncommittee are forbid to export negroes from Africa, or to import any\nAfrican goods into Great Britain. But as they are charged with the\nmaintenance of forts and garrisons, they may, for that purpose export from\nGreat Britain to Africa goods and stores of different kinds. Out of the\nmoneys which they shall receive from the company, they are allowed a sum,\nnot exceeding eight hundred pounds, for the salaries of their clerks and\nagents at London, Bristol, and Liverpool, the house-rent of their offices\nat London, and all other expenses of management, commission, and agency,\nin England. What remains of this sum, after defraying these different\nexpenses, they may divide among themselves, as compensation for their\ntrouble, in what manner they think proper. By this constitution, it might\nhave been expected, that the spirit of monopoly would have been\neffectually restrained, and the first of these purposes sufficiently\nanswered. It would seem, however, that it had not. Though by the 4th of\nGeorge III. c.20, the fort of Senegal, with all its dependencies, had been\ninvested in the company of merchants trading to Africa, yet, in the year\nfollowing (by the 5th of George III. c.44), not only Senegal and its\ndependencies, but the whole coast, from the port of Sallee, in South\nBarbary, to Cape Rouge, was exempted from the jurisdiction of that\ncompany, was vested in the crown, and the trade to it declared free to all\nhis majesty\u2019s subjects. The company had been suspected of restraining the\ntrade and of establishing some sort of improper monopoly. It is not,\nhowever, very easy to conceive how, under the regulations of the 23d\nGeorge II. they could do so. In the printed debates of the house of\ncommons, not always the most authentic records of truth, I observe,\nhowever, that they have been accused of this. The members of the committee\nof nine being all merchants, and the governors and factors in their\ndifferent forts and settlements being all dependent upon them, it is not\nunlikely that the latter might have given peculiar attention to the\nconsignments and commissions of the former, which would establish a real\nmonopoly.\nFor the second of these purposes, the maintenance of the forts and\ngarrisons, an annual sum has been allotted to them by parliament,\ngenerally about \u00a313,000. For the proper application of this sum, the\ncommittee is obliged to account annually to the cursitor baron of\nexchequer; which account is afterwards to be laid before parliament. But\nparliament, which gives so little attention to the application of\nmillions, is not likely to give much to that of \u00a313,000 a-year; and the\ncursitor baron of exchequer, from his profession and education, is not\nlikely to be profoundly skilled in the proper expense of forts and\ngarrisons. The captains of his majesty\u2019s navy, indeed, or any other\ncommissioned officers, appointed by the board of admiralty, may inquire\ninto the condition of the forts and garrisons, and report their\nobservations to that board. But that board seems to have no direct\njurisdiction over the committee, nor any authority to correct those whose\nconduct it may thus inquire into; and the captains of his majesty\u2019s navy,\nbesides, are not supposed to be always deeply learned in the science of\nfortification. Removal from an office, which can be enjoyed only for the\nterm of three years, and of which the lawful emoluments, even during that\nterm, are so very small, seems to be the utmost punishment to which any\ncommittee-man is liable, for any fault, except direct malversation, or\nembezzlement, either of the public money, or of that of the company; and\nthe fear of the punishment can never be a motive of sufficient weight to\nforce a continual and careful attention to a business to which he has no\nother interest to attend. The committee are accused of having sent out\nbricks and stones from England for the reparation of Cape Coast Castle, on\nthe coast of Guinea; a business for which parliament had several times\ngranted an extraordinary sum of money. These bricks and stones, too, which\nhad thus been sent upon so long a voyage, were said to have been of so bad\na quality, that it was necessary to rebuild, from the foundation, the\nwalls which had been repaired with them. The forts and garrisons which lie\nnorth of Cape Rouge, are not only maintained at the expense of the state,\nbut are under the immediate government of the executive power; and why\nthose which lie south of that cape, and which, too, are, in part at least,\nmaintained at the expense of the state, should be under a different\ngovernment, it seems not very easy even to imagine a good reason. The\nprotection of the Mediterranean trade was the original purpose or pretence\nof the garrisons of Gibraltar and Minorca; and the maintenance and\ngovernment of those garrisons have always been, very properly, committed,\nnot to the Turkey company, but to the executive power. In the extent of\nits dominion consists, in a great measure, the pride and dignity of that\npower; and it is not very likely to fail in attention to what is necessary\nfor the defence of that dominion. The garrisons at Gibraltar and Minorca,\naccordingly, have never been neglected. Though Minorca has been twice\ntaken, and is now probably lost for ever, that disaster has never been\nimputed to any neglect in the executive power. I would not, however, be\nunderstood to insinuate, that either of those expensive garrisons was\never, even in the smallest degree, necessary for the purpose for which\nthey were originally dismembered from the Spanish monarchy. That\ndismemberment, perhaps, never served any other real purpose than to\nalienate from England her natural ally the king of Spain, and to unite the\ntwo principal branches of the house of Bourbon in a much stricter and more\npermanent alliance than the ties of blood could ever have united them.\nJoint-stock companies, established either by royal charter, or by act of\nparliament, are different in several respects, not only from regulated\ncompanies, but from private copartneries.\nFirst, In a private copartnery, no partner without the consent of the\ncompany, can transfer his share to another person, or introduce a new\nmember into the company. Each member, however, may, upon proper warning,\nwithdraw from the copartnery, and demand payment from them of his share of\nthe common stock. In a joint-stock company, on the contrary, no member can\ndemand payment of his share from the company; but each member can, without\ntheir consent, transfer his share to another person, and thereby introduce\na new member. The value of a share in a joint stock is always the price\nwhich it will bring in the market; and this may be either greater or less\nin any proportion, than the sum which its owner stands credited for in the\nstock of the company.\nSecondly, In a private copartnery, each partner is bound for the debts\ncontracted by the company, to the whole extent of his fortune. In a\njoint-stock company, on the contrary, each partner is bound only to the\nextent of his share.\nThe trade of a joint-stock company is always managed by a court of\ndirectors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects, to\nthe control of a general court of proprietors. But the greater part of\nthese proprietors seldom pretend to understand any thing of the business\nof the company; and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail\namong them, give themselves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly\nsuch halfyearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make\nto them. This total exemption front trouble and front risk, beyond a\nlimited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint-stock\ncompanies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any\nprivate copartnery. Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to themselves\nmuch greater stocks, than any private copartnery can boast of. The trading\nstock of the South Sea company at one time amounted to upwards of\nthirty-three millions eight hundred thousand pounds. The divided capital\nof the Bank of England amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred\nand eighty thousand pounds. The directors of such companies, however,\nbeing the managers rather of other people\u2019s money than of their own, it\ncannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same\nanxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery\nfrequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are\napt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master\u2019s\nhonour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it.\nNegligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in\nthe management of the affairs of such a company. It is upon this account,\nthat joint-stock companies for foreign trade have seldom been able to\nmaintain the competition against private adventurers. They have,\naccordingly, very seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege; and\nfrequently have not succeeded with one. Without an exclusive privilege,\nthey have commonly mismanaged the trade. With an exclusive privilege, they\nhave both mismanaged and confined it.\nThe Royal African company, the predecessors of the present African\ncompany, had an exclusive privilege by charter; but as that charter had\nnot been confirmed by act of parliament, the trade, in consequence of the\ndeclaration of rights, was, soon after the Revolution, laid open to all\nhis majesty\u2019s subjects. The Hudson\u2019s Bay company are, as to their legal\nrights, in the same situation as the Royal African company. Their\nexclusive charter has not been confirmed by act of parliament. The South\nSea company, as long as they continued to be a trading company, had an\nexclusive privilege confirmed by act of parliament; as have likewise the\npresent united company of merchants trading to the East Indies.\nThe Royal African company soon found that they could not maintain the\ncompetition against private adventurers, whom, notwithstanding the\ndeclaration of rights, they continued for some time to call interlopers,\nand to persecute as such. In 1698, however, the private adventurers were\nsubjected to a duty of ten per cent. upon almost all the different\nbranches of their trade, to be employed by the company in the maintenance\nof their forts and garrisons. But, notwithstanding this heavy tax, the\ncompany were still unable to maintain the competition. Their stock and\ncredit gradually declined. In 1712, their debts had become so great, that\na particular act of parliament was thought necessary, both for their\nsecurity and for that of their creditors. It was enacted, that the\nresolution of two-thirds of these creditors in number and value should\nbind the rust, both with regard to the time which should be allowed to the\ncompany for the payment of their debts, and with regard to any other\nagreement which it might be thought proper to make with them concerning\nthose debts. In 1730, their affairs were in so great disorder, that they\nwere altogether incapable of maintaining their forts and garrisons, the\nsole purpose and pretext of their institution. From that year till their\nfinal dissolution, the parliament judged it necessary to allow the annual\nsum of \u00a310,000 for that purpose. In 1732, after having been for many years\nlosers by the trade of carrying negroes to the West Indies, they at last\nresolved to give it up altogether; to sell to the private traders to\nAmerica the negroes which they purchased upon the coast; and to employ\ntheir servants in a trade to the inland parts of Africa for gold dust,\nelephants teeth, dyeing drugs, etc. But their success in this more\nconfined trade was not greater than in their former extensive one. Their\naffairs continued to go gradually to decline, till at last, being in every\nrespect a bankrupt company, they were dissolved by act of parliament, and\ntheir forts and garrisons vested in the present regulated company of\nmerchants trading to Africa. Before the erection of the Royal African\ncompany, there had been three other joint-stock companies successively\nestablished, one after another, for the African trade. They were all\nequally unsuccessful. They all, however, had exclusive charters, which,\nthough not confirmed by act of parliament, were in those days supposed to\nconvey a real exclusive privilege.\nThe Hudson\u2019s Bay company, before their misfortunes in the late war, had\nbeen much more fortunate than the Royal African company. Their necessary\nexpense is much smaller. The whole number of people whom they maintain in\ntheir different settlements and habitations, which they have honoured with\nthe name of forts, is said not to exceed a hundred and twenty persons.\nThis number, however, is sufficient to prepare beforehand the cargo of\nfurs and other goods necessary for loading their ships, which, on account\nof the ice, can seldom remain above six or eight weeks in those seas. This\nadvantage of having a cargo ready prepared, could not, for several years,\nbe acquired by private adventurers; and without it there seems to be no\npossibility of trading to Hudson\u2019s Bay. The moderate capital of the\ncompany, which, it is said, does not exceed one hundred and ten thousand\npounds, may, besides, be sufficient to enable them to engross the whole,\nor almost the whole trade and surplus produce, of the miserable though\nextensive country comprehended within their charter. No private\nadventurers, accordingly, have ever attempted to trade to that country in\ncompetition with them. This company, therefore, have always enjoyed an\nexclusive trade, in fact, though they may have no right to it in law. Over\nand above all this, the moderate capital of this company is said to be\ndivided among a very small number of proprietors. But a joint-stock\ncompany, consisting of a small number of proprietors, with a moderate\ncapital, approaches very nearly to the nature of a private copartnery, and\nmay be capable of nearly the same degree of vigilance and attention. It is\nnot to be wondered at, therefore, if, in consequence of these different\nadvantages, the Hudson\u2019s Bay company had, before the late war, been able\nto carry on their trade with a considerable degree of success. It does not\nseem probable, however, that their profits ever approached to what the\nlate Mr Dobbs imagined them. A much more sober and judicious writer, Mr\nAnderson, author of the Historical and Chronological Deduction of\nCommerce, very justly observes, that upon examining the accounts which Mr\nDobbs himself has given for several years together, of their exports and\nimports, and upon making proper allowances for their extraordinary risk\nand expense, it does not appear that their profits deserve to be envied,\nor that they can much, if at all, exceed the ordinary profits of trade.\nThe South Sea company never had any forts or garrisons to maintain, and\ntherefore were entirely exempted from one great expense, to which other\njoint-stock companies for foreign trade are subject; but they had an\nimmense capital divided among an immense number of proprietors. It was\nnaturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and\nprofusion, should prevail in the whole management of their affairs. The\nknavery and extravagance of their stock-jobbing projects are sufficiently\nknown, and the explication of them would be foreign to the present\nsubject. Their mercantile projects were not much better conducted. The\nfirst trade which they engaged in, was that of supplying the Spanish West\nIndies with negroes, of which (in consequence of what was called the\nAssiento Contract granted them by the treaty of Utrecht) they had the\nexclusive privilege. But as it was not expected that much profit could be\nmade by this trade, both the Portuguese and French companies, who had\nenjoyed it upon the same terms before them, having been ruined by it, they\nwere allowed, as compensation, to send annually a ship of a certain\nburden, to trade directly to the Spanish West Indies. Of the ten voyages\nwhich this annual ship was allowed to make, they are said to have gained\nconsiderably by one, that of the Royal Caroline, in 1731; and to have been\nlosers, more or less, by almost all the rest. Their ill success was\nimputed, by their factors and agents, to the extortion and oppression of\nthe Spanish government; but was, perhaps, principally owing to the\nprofusion and depredations of those very factors and agents; some of whom\nare said to have acquired great fortunes, even in one year. In 1734, the\ncompany petitioned the king, that they might be allowed to dispose of the\ntrade and tonnage of their annual ship, on account of the little profit\nwhich they made by it, and to accept of such equivalent as they could\nobtain from the king of Spain.\nIn 1724, this company had undertaken the whale fishery. Of this, indeed,\nthey had no monopoly; but as long as they carried it on, no other British\nsubjects appear to have engaged in it. Of the eight voyages which their\nships made to Greenland, they were gainers by one, and losers by all the\nrest. After their eighth and last voyage, when they had sold their ships,\nstores, and utensils, they found that their whole loss upon this branch,\ncapital and interest included, amounted to upwards of \u00a3237,000.\nIn 1722, this company petitioned the parliament to be allowed to divide\ntheir immense capital of more than thirty-three millions eight hundred\nthousand pounds, the whole of which had been lent to government, into two\nequal parts; the one half, or upwards of \u00a316,900,000, to be put upon the\nsame footing with other government annuities, and not to be subject to the\ndebts contracted, or losses incurred, by the directors of the company, in\nthe prosecution of their mercantile projects; the other half to remain as\nbefore, a trading stock, and to be subject to those debts and losses. The\npetition was too reasonable not to be granted. In 1733, they again\npetitioned the parliament, that three-fourths of their trading stock might\nbe turned into annuity stock, and only one-fourth remain as trading stock,\nor exposed to the hazards arising from the bad management of their\ndirectors. Both their annuity and trading stocks had, by this time, been\nreduced more than two millions each, by several different payments from\ngovernment; so that this fourth amounted only to \u00a33,662,784:8:6. In 1748,\nall the demands of the company upon the king of Spain, in consequence of\nthe assiento contract, were, by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, given up\nfor what was supposed an equivalent. An end was put to their trade with\nthe Spanish West Indies; the remainder of their trading stock was turned\ninto an annuity stock; and the company ceased, in every respect, to be a\ntrading company.\nIt ought to be observed, that in the trade which the South Sea company\ncarried on by means of their annual ship, the only trade by which it ever\nwas expected that they could make any considerable profit, they were not\nwithout competitors, either in the foreign or in the home market. At\nCarthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to encounter the\ncompetition of the Spanish merchants, who brought from Cadiz to those\nmarkets European goods, of the same kind with the outward cargo of their\nship; and in England they had to encounter that of the English merchants,\nwho imported from Cadiz goods of the Spanish West Indies, of the same kind\nwith the inward cargo. The goods, both of the Spanish and English\nmerchants, indeed, were, perhaps, subject to higher duties. But the loss\noccasioned by the negligence, profusion, and malversation of the servants\nof the company, had probably been a tax much heavier than all those\nduties. That a joint-stock company should be able to carry on successfully\nany branch of foreign trade, when private adventurers can come into any\nsort of open and fair competition with them, seems contrary to all\nexperience.\nThe old English East India company was established in 1600, by a charter\nfrom Queen Elizabeth. In the first twelve voyages which they fitted out\nfor India, they appear to have traded as a regulated company, with\nseparate stocks, though only in the general ships of the company. In 1612,\nthey united into a joint stock. Their charter was exclusive, and, though\nnot confirmed by act of parliament, was in those days supposed to convey a\nreal exclusive privilege. For many years, therefore, they were not much\ndisturbed by interlopers. Their capital, which never exceeded \u00a3744,000,\nand of which \u00a350 was a share, was not so exorbitant, nor their dealings so\nextensive, as to afford either a pretext for gross negligence and\nprofusion, or a cover to gross malversation. Notwithstanding some\nextraordinary losses, occasioned partly by the malice of the Dutch East\nIndia company, and partly by other accidents, they carried on for many\nyears a successful trade. But in process of time, when the principles of\nliberty were better understood, it became every day more and more\ndoubtful, how far a royal charter, not confirmed by act of parliament,\ncould convey an exclusive privilege. Upon this question the decisions of\nthe courts of justice were not uniform, but varied with the authority of\ngovernment, and the humours of the times. Interlopers multiplied upon\nthem; and towards the end of the reign of Charles II., through the whole\nof that of James II., and during a part of that of William III., reduced\nthem to great distress. In 1698, a proposal was made to parliament, of\nadvancing two millions to government, at eight per cent. provided the\nsubscribers were erected into a new East India company, with exclusive\nprivileges. The old East India company offered seven hundred thousand\npounds, nearly the amount of their capital, at four per cent. upon the\nsame conditions. But such was at that time the state of public credit,\nthat it was more convenient for government to borrow two millions at eight\nper cent. than seven hundred thousand pounds at four. The proposal of the\nnew subscribers was accepted, and a new East India company established in\nconsequence. The old East India company, however, had a right to continue\ntheir trade till 1701. They had, at the same time, in the name of their\ntreasurer, subscribed very artfully three hundred and fifteen thousand\npounds into the stock of the new. By a negligence in the expression of the\nact of parliament, which vested the East India trade in the subscribers to\nthis loan of two millions, it did not appear evident that they were all\nobliged to unite into a joint stock. A few private traders, whose\nsubscriptions amounted only to seven thousand two hundred pounds, insisted\nupon the privilege of trading separately upon their own stocks, and at\ntheir own risks. The old East India company had a right to a separate\ntrade upon their own stock till 1701; and they had likewise, both before\nand after that period, a right, like that or other private traders, to a\nseparate trade upon the \u00a3315,000, which they had subscribed into the stock\nof the new company. The competition of the two companies with the private\ntraders, and with one another, is said to have well nigh ruined both. Upon\na subsequent occasion, in 1750, when a proposal was made to parliament for\nputting the trade under the management of a regulated company, and thereby\nlaying it in some measure open, the East India company, in opposition to\nthis proposal, represented, in very strong terms, what had been, at this\ntime, the miserable effects, as they thought them, of this competition. In\nIndia, they said, it raised the price of goods so high, that they were not\nworth the buying; and in England, by overstocking the market, it sunk\ntheir price so low, that no profit could be made by them. That by a more\nplentiful supply, to the great advantage and conveniency of the public, it\nmust have reduced very much the price of India goods in the English\nmarket, cannot well be doubted; but that it should have raised very much\ntheir price in the Indian market, seems not very probable, as all the\nextraordinary demand which that competition could occasion must have been\nbut as a drop of water in the immense ocean of Indian commerce. The\nincrease of demand, besides, though in the beginning it may sometimes\nraise the price of goods, never fails to lower it in the long-run. It\nencourages production, and thereby increases the competition of the\nproducers, who, in order to undersell one another, have recourse to new\ndivisions or labour and new improvements of art, which might never\notherwise have been thought of. The miserable effects of which the company\ncomplained, were the cheapness of consumption, and the encouragement given\nto production; precisely the two effects which it is the great business of\npolitical economy to promote. The competition, however, of which they gave\nthis doleful account, had not been allowed to be of long continuance. In\n1702, the two companies were, in some measure, united by an indenture\ntripartite, to which the queen was the third party; and in 1708, they were\nby act of parliament, perfectly consolidated into one company, by their\npresent name of the United Company of Merchants trading to the East\nIndies. Into this act it was thought worth while to insert a clause,\nallowing the separate traders to continue their trade till Michaelmas\n1711; but at the same time empowering the directors, upon three years\nnotice, to redeem their little capital of seven thousand two hundred\npounds, and thereby to convert the whole stock of the company into a joint\nstock. By the same act, the capital of the company, in consequence of a\nnew loan to government, was augmented from two millions to three millions\ntwo hundred thousand pounds. In 1743, the company advanced another million\nto government. But this million being raised, not by a call upon the\nproprietors, but by selling annuities and contracting bond-debts, it did\nnot augment the stock upon which the proprietors could claim a dividend.\nIt augmented, however, their trading stock, it being equally liable with\nthe other three millions two hundred thousand pounds, to the losses\nsustained, and debts contracted by the company in prosecution of their\nmercantile projects. From 1708, or at least from 1711, this company, being\ndelivered from all competitors, and fully established in the monopoly of\nthe English commerce to the East Indies, carried on a successful trade,\nand from their profits, made annually a moderate dividend to their\nproprietors. During the French war, which began in 1741, the ambition of\nMr Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, involved them in the wars\nof the Carnatic, and in the politics of the Indian princes. After many\nsignal successes, and equally signal losses, they at last lost Madras, at\nthat time their principal settlement in India. It was restored to them by\nthe treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; and, about this time the spirit of war and\nconquest seems to have taken possession of their servants in India, and\nnever since to have left them. During the French war, which began in 1755,\ntheir arms partook of the general good fortune of those of Great Britain.\nThey defended Madras, took Pondicherry, recovered Calcutta, and acquired\nthe revenues of a rich and extensive territory, amounting, it was then\nsaid, to upwards of three millions a-year. They remained for several years\nin quiet possession of this revenue; but in 1767, administration laid\nclaim to their territorial acquisitions, and the revenue arising from\nthem, as of right belonging to the crown; and the company, in compensation\nfor this claim, agreed to pay to government \u00a3400,000 a-year. They had,\nbefore this, gradually augmented their dividend from about six to ten per\ncent.; that is, upon their capital of three millions two hundred thousand\npounds, they had increased it by \u00a3128,000, or had raised it from one\nhundred and ninety-two thousand to three hundred and twenty thousand\npounds a-year. They were attempting about this time to raise it still\nfurther, to twelve and a-half per cent., which would have made their\nannual payments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay\nannually to government, or to \u00a3400,000 a-year. But during the two years in\nwhich their agreement with government was to take place, they were\nrestrained from any further increase of dividend by two successive acts of\nparliament, of which the object was to enable them to make a speedier\nprogress in the payment of their debts, which were at this time estimated\nat upwards of six or seven millions sterling. In 1769, they renewed their\nagreement with government for five years more, and stipulated, that during\nthe course of that period, they should be allowed gradually to increase\ntheir dividend to twelve and a-half per cent; never increasing it,\nhowever, more than one per cent. in one year. This increase of dividend,\ntherefore, when it had risen to its utmost height, could augment their\nannual payments, to their proprietors and government together, but by\n\u00a3680,000, beyond what they had been before their late territorial\nacquisitions. What the gross revenue of those territorial acquisitions was\nsupposed to amount to, has already been mentioned; and by an account\nbrought by the Cruttenden East Indiaman in 1769, the neat revenue, clear\nof all deductions and military charges, was stated at two millions\nforty-eight thousand seven hundred and forty-seven pounds. They were said,\nat the same time, to possess another revenue, arising partly from lands,\nbut chiefly from the customs established at their different settlements,\namounting to \u00a3439,000. The profits of their trade, too, according to the\nevidence of their chairman before the house of commons, amounted, at this\ntime, to at least \u00a3400,000 a-year; according to that of their accountant,\nto at least \u00a3500,000; according to the lowest account, at least equal to\nthe highest dividend that was to be paid to their proprietors. So great a\nrevenue might certainly have afforded an augmentation of \u00a3680,000 in their\nannual payments; and, at the same time, have left a large sinking fund,\nsufficient for the speedy reduction of their debt. In 1773, however, their\ndebts, instead of being reduced, were augmented by an arrear to the\ntreasury in the payment of the four hundred thousand pounds; by another to\nthe custom-house for duties unpaid; by a large debt to the bank, for money\nborrowed; and by a fourth, for bills drawn upon them from India, and\nwantonly accepted, to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred thousand\npounds. The distress which these accumulated claims brought upon them,\nobliged them not only to reduce all at once their dividend to six per\ncent. but to throw themselves upon the mercy of govermnent, and to\nsupplicate, first, a release from the further payment of the stipulated\n\u00a3400,000 a-year; and, secondly, a loan of fourteen hundred thousand, to\nsave them from immediate bankruptcy. The great increase of their fortune\nhad, it seems, only served to furnish their servants with a pretext for\ngreater profusion, and a cover for greater malversation, than in\nproportion even to that increase of fortune. The conduct of their servants\nin India, and the general state of their affairs both in India and in\nEurope, became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry: in consequence of\nwhich, several very important alterations were made in the constitution of\ntheir government, both at home and abroad. In India, their principal\nsettlements or Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, which had before been\naltogether independent of one another, were subjected to a\ngovernor-general, assisted by a council of four assessors, parliament\nassuming to itself the first nomination of this governor and council, who\nwere to reside at Calcutta; that city having now become, what Madras was\nbefore, the most important of the English settlements in India. The court\nof the Mayor of Calcutta, originally instituted for the trial of\nmercantile causes, which arose in the city and neighbourhood, had\ngradually extended its jurisdiction with the extension of the empire. It\nwas now reduced and confined to the original purpose of its institution.\nInstead of it, a new supreme court of judicature was established,\nconsisting of a chief justice and three judges, to be appointed by the\ncrown. In Europe, the qualification necessary to entitle a proprietor to\nvote at their general courts was raised, from five hundred pounds, the\noriginal price of a share in the stock of the company, to a thousand\npounds. In order to vote upon this qualification, too, it was declared\nnecessary, that he should have possessed it, if acquired by his own\npurchase, and not by inheritance, for at least one year, instead of six\nmonths, the term requisite before. The court of twenty-four directors had\nbefore been chosen annually; but it was now enacted, that each director\nshould, for the future, be chosen for four years; six of them, however, to\ngo out of office by rotation every year, and not be capable of being\nre-chosen at the election of the six new directors for the ensuing year.\nIn consequence of these alterations, the courts, both of the proprietors\nand directors, it was expected, would be likely to act with more dignity\nand steadiness than they had usually done before. But it seems impossible,\nby any alterations, to render those courts, in any respect, fit to govern,\nor even to share in the government of a great empire; because the greater\npart of their members must always have too little interest in the\nprosperity of that empire, to give any serious attention to what may\npromote it. Frequently a man of great, sometimes even a man of small\nfortune, is willing to purchase a thousand pounds share in India stock,\nmerely for the influence which he expects to aquire by a vote in the court\nof proprietors. It gives him a share, though not in the plunder, yet in\nthe appointment of the plunderers of India; the court of directors, though\nthey make that appointment, being necessarily more or less under the\ninfluence of the proprietors, who not only elect those directors, but\nsometimes over-rule the appointments of their servants in India. Provided\nhe can enjoy this influence for a few years, and thereby provide for a\ncertain number of his friends, he frequently cares little about the\ndividend, or even about the value of the stock upon which his vote is\nfounded. About the prosperity of the great empire, in the government of\nwhich that vote gives him a share, he seldom cares at all. No other\nsovereigns ever were, or, from the nature of things, ever could be, so\nperfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects, the\nimprovement or waste of their dominions, the glory or disgrace of their\nadministration, as, from irresistible moral causes, the greater part of\nthe proprietors of such a mercantile company are, and necessarily must be.\nThis indifference, too, was more likely to be increased than diminished by\nsome of the new regulations which were made in consequence of the\nparliamentary inquiry. By a resolution of the house of commons, for\nexample, it was declared, that when the \u00a31,400,000 lent to the company by\ngovernment, should be paid, and their bond-debts be reduced to \u00a31,500,000,\nthey might then, and not till then, divide eight per cent. upon their\ncapital; and that whatever remained of their revenues and neat profits at\nhome should be divided into four parts; three of them to be paid into the\nexchequer for the use of the public, and the fourth to be reserved as a\nfund, either for the further reduction of their bond-debts, or for the\ndischarge of other contingent exigencies which the company might labour\nunder. But if the company were bad stewards and bad sovereigns, when the\nwhole of their neat revenue and profits belonged to themselves, and were\nat their own disposal, they were surely not likely to be better when\nthree-fourths of them were to belong to other people, and the other\nfourth, though to be laid out for the benefit of the company, yet to be so\nunder the inspection and with the approbation of other people.\nIt might be more agreeable to the company, that their own servants and\ndependants should have either the pleasure of wasting, or the profit of\nembezzling, whatever surplus might remain, after paying the proposed\ndividend of eight per cent. than that it should come into the hands of a\nset of people with whom those resolutions could scarce fail to set them in\nsome measure at variance. The interest of those servants and dependants\nmight so far predominate in the court of proprietors, as sometimes to\ndispose it to support the authors of depredations which had been committed\nin direct violation of its own authority. With the majority of\nproprietors, the support even of the authority of their own court might\nsometimes be a matter of less consequence than the support of those who\nhad set that authority at defiance.\nThe regulations of 1773, accordingly, did not put an end to the disorder\nof the company\u2019s government in India. Notwithstanding that, during a\nmomentary fit of good conduct, they had at one time collected into the\ntreasury of Calcutta more than \u00a33,000,000 sterling; notwithstanding that\nthey had afterwards extended either their dominion or their depredations\nover a vast accession of some of the richest and most fertile countries in\nIndia, all was wasted and destroyed. They found themselves altogether\nunprepared to stop or resist the incursion of Hyder Ali; and in\nconsequence of those disorders, the company is now (1784) in greater\ndistress than ever; and, in order to prevent immediate bankruptcy, is once\nmore reduced to supplicate the assistance of government. Different plans\nhave been proposed by the different parties in parliament for the better\nmanagement of its affairs; and all those plans seem to agree in supposing,\nwhat was indeed always abundantly evident, that it is altogether unfit to\ngovern its territorial possessions. Even the company itself seems to be\nconvinced of its own incapacity so far, and seems, upon that account\nwilling to give them up to government.\nWith the right of possessing forts and garrisons in distant and barbarous\ncountries is necessarily connected the right of making peace and war in\nthose countries. The joint-stock companies, which have had the one right,\nhave constantly exercised the other, and have frequently had it expressly\nconferred upon them. How unjustly, how capriciously, how cruelly, they\nhave commonly exercised it, is too well known from recent experience.\nWhen a company of merchants undertake, at their own risk and expense, to\nestablish a new trade with some remote and barbarous nation, it may not be\nunreasonable to incorporate them into a joint-stock company, and to grant\nthem, in case of their success, a monopoly of the trade for a certain\nnumber of years. It is the easiest and most natural way in which the state\ncan recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive experiment, of\nwhich the public is afterwards to reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly\nof this kind may be vindicated, upon the same principles upon which a like\nmonopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and that of a new\nbook to its author. But upon the expiration of the term, the monopoly\nought certainly to determine; the forts and garrisons, if it was found\nnecessary to establish any, to be taken into the hands of government,\ntheir value to be paid to the company, and the trade to be laid open to\nall the subjects of the state. By a perpetual monopoly, all the other\nsubjects of the state are taxed very absurdly in two different ways:\nfirst, by the high price of goods, which, in the case of a free trade,\nthey could buy much cheaper; and, secondly, by their total exclusion from\na branch of business which it might be both convenient and profitable for\nmany of them to carry on. It is for the most worthless of all purposes,\ntoo, that they are taxed in this manner. It is merely to enable the\ncompany to support the negligence, profusion, and malversation of their\nown servants, whose disorderly conduct seldom allows the dividend of the\ncompany to exceed the ordinary rate of profit in trades which are\naltogether free, and very frequently makes a fall even a good deal short\nof that rate. Without a monopoly, however, a joint-stock company, it would\nappear from experience, cannot long carry on any branch of foreign trade.\nTo buy in one market, in order to sell with profit in another, when there\nare many competitors in both; to watch over, not only the occasional\nvariations in the demand, but the much greater and more frequent\nvariations in the competition, or in the supply which that demand is\nlikely to get from other people; and to suit with dexterity and judgment\nboth the quantity and quality of each assortment of goods to all these\ncircumstances, is a species of warfare, of which the operations are\ncontinually changing, and which can scarce ever be conducted successfully,\nwithout such an unremitting exertion of vigilance and attention as cannot\nlong be expected from the directors of a joint-stock company. The East\nIndia company, upon the redemption of their funds, and the expiration of\ntheir exclusive privilege, have a right, by act of parliament, to continue\na corporation with a joint stock, and to trade in their corporate capacity\nto the East Indies, in common with the rest of their fellow subjects. But\nin this situation, the superior vigilance and attention of a private\nadventurer would, in all probability, soon make them weary of the trade.\nAn eminent French author, of great knowledge in matters of political\neconomy, the Abbe Morellet, gives a list of fifty-five joint-stock\ncompanies for foreign trade, which have been established in different\nparts of Europe since the year 1600, and which, according to him, have all\nfailed from mismanagement, notwithstanding they had exclusive privileges.\nHe has been misinformed with regard to the history of two or three of\nthem, which were not joint-stock companies and have not failed. But, in\ncompensation, there have been several joint-stock companies which have\nfailed, and which he has omitted.\nThe only trades which it seems possible for a joint-stock company to carry\non successfully, without an exclusive privilege, are those, of which all\nthe operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a routine,\nor to such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation. Of\nthis kind is, first, the banking trade; secondly, the trade of insurance\nfrom fire and from sea risk, and capture in time of war; thirdly, the\ntrade of making and maintaining a navigable cut or canal; and, fourthly,\nthe similar trade of bringing water for the supply of a great city.\nThough the principles of the banking trade may appear somewhat abstruse,\nthe practice is capable of being reduced to strict rules. To depart upon\nany occasion from those rules, in consequence of some flattering\nspeculation of extraordinary gain, is almost always extremely dangerous\nand frequently fatal to the banking company which attempts it. But the\nconstitution of joint-stock companies renders them in general, more\ntenacious of established rules than any private copartnery. Such\ncompanies, therefore, seem extremely well fitted for this trade. The\nprincipal banking companies in Europe, accordingly, are joint-stock\ncompanies, many of which manage their trade very successfully without any\nexclusive privilege. The bank of England has no other exclusive privilege,\nexcept that no other banking company in England shall consist of more than\nsix persons. The two banks of Edinburgh are joint-stock companies, without\nany exclusive privilege.\nThe value of the risk, either from fire, or from loss by sea, or by\ncapture, though it cannot, perhaps, be calculated very exactly, admits,\nhowever, of such a gross estimation, as renders it, in some degree,\nreducible to strict rule and method. The trade of insurance, therefore,\nmay be carried on successfully by a joint-stock company, without any\nexclusive privilege. Neither the London Assurance, nor the Royal Exchange\nAssurance companies have any such privilege.\nWhen a navigable cut or canal has been once made, the management of it\nbecomes quite simple and easy, and it is reducible to strict rule and\nmethod. Even the making of it is so, as it may be contracted for with\nundertakers, at so much a mile, and so much a lock. The same thing may be\nsaid of a canal, an aqueduct, or a great pipe for bringing water to supply\na great city. Such under-takings, therefore, may be, and accordingly\nfrequently are, very successfully managed by joint-stock companies,\nwithout any exclusive privilege.\nTo establish a joint-stock company, however, for any undertaking, merely\nbecause such a company might be capable of managing it successfully; or,\nto exempt a particular set of dealers from some of the general laws which\ntake place with regard to all their neighbours, merely because they might\nbe capable of thriving, if they had such an exemption, would certainly not\nbe reasonable. To render such an establishment perfectly reasonable, with\nthe circumstance of being reducible to strict rule and method, two other\ncircumstances ought to concur. First, it ought to appear with the clearest\nevidence, that the undertaking is of greater and more general utility than\nthe greater part of common trades; and, secondly, that it requires a\ngreater capital than can easily be collected into a private copartnery. If\na moderate capital were sufficient, the great utility of the undertaking\nwould not be a sufficient reason for establishing a joint-stock company;\nbecause, in this case, the demand for what it was to produce, would\nreadily and easily be supplied by private adventurers. In the four trades\nabove mentioned, both those circumstances concur.\nThe great and general utility of the banking trade, when prudently\nmanaged, has been fully explained in the second book of this Inquiry. But\na public bank, which is to support public credit, and, upon particular\nemergencies, to advance to government the whole produce of a tax, to the\namount, perhaps, of several millions, a year or two before it comes in,\nrequires a greater capital than can easily be collected into any private\ncopartnery.\nThe trade of insurance gives great security to the fortunes of private\npeople, and, by dividing among a great many that loss which would ruin an\nindividual, makes it fall light and easy upon the whole society. In order\nto give this security, however, it is necessary that the insurers should\nhave a very large capital. Before the establishment of the two joint-stock\ncompanies for insurance in London, a list, it is said, was laid before the\nattorney-general, of one hundred and fifty private usurers, who had failed\nin the course of a few years.\nThat navigable cuts and canals, and the works which are sometimes\nnecessary for supplying a great city with water, are of great and general\nutility, while, at the same time, they frequently require a greater\nexpense than suits the fortunes of private people, is sufficiently\nobvious.\nExcept the four trades above mentioned, I have not been able to recollect\nany other, in which all the three circumstances requisite for rendering\nreasonable the establishment of a joint-stock company concur. The English\ncopper company of London, the lead-smelting company, the glass-grinding\ncompany, have not even the pretext of any great or singular utility in the\nobject which they pursue; nor does the pursuit of that object seem to\nrequire any expense unsuitable to the fortunes of many private men.\nWhether the trade which those companies carry on, is reducible to such\nstrict rule and method as to render it fit for the management of a\njoint-stock company, or whether they have any reason to boast of their\nextraordinary profits, I do not pretend to know. The mine-adventurers\ncompany has been long ago bankrupt. A share in the stock of the British\nLinen company of Edinburgh sells, at present, very much below par, though\nless so than it did some years ago. The joint-stock companies, which are\nestablished for the public-spirited purpose of promoting some particular\nmanufacture, over and above managing their own affairs ill, to the\ndiminution of the general stock of the society, can, in other respects,\nscarce ever fail to do more harm than good. Notwithstanding the most\nupright intentions, the unavoidable partiality of their directors to\nparticular branches of the manufacture, of which the undertakers mislead\nand impose upon them, is a real discouragement to the rest, and\nnecessarily breaks, more or less, that natural proportion which would\notherwise establish itself between judicious industry and profit, and\nwhich, to the general industry of the country, is of all encouragements\nthe greatest and the most effectual.\nART. II.\u2014Of the Expense of the Institution for the Education of\nYouth.\nThe institutions for the education of the youth may, in the same manner,\nfurnish a revenue sufficient for defraying their own expense. The fee or\nhonorary, which the scholar pays to the master, naturally constitutes a\nrevenue of this kind.\nEven where the reward of the master does not arise altogether from this\nnatural revenue, it still is not necessary that it should be derived from\nthat general revenue of the society, of which the collection and\napplication are, in most countries, assigned to the executive power.\nThrough the greater part of Europe, accordingly, the endowment of schools\nand colleges makes either no charge upon that general revenue, or but a\nvery small one. It everywhere arises chiefly from some local or provincial\nrevenue, from the rent of some landed estate, or from the interest of some\nsum of money, allotted and put under the management of trustees for this\nparticular purpose, sometimes by the sovereign himself, and sometimes by\nsome private donor.\nHave those public endowments contributed in general, to promote the end of\ntheir institution? Have they contributed to encourage the diligence, and\nto improve the abilities, of the teachers? Have they directed the course\nof education towards objects more useful, both to the individual and to\nthe public, than those to which it would naturally have gone of its own\naccord? It should not seem very difficult to give at least a probable\nanswer to each of those questions.\nIn every profession, the exertion of the greater part of those who\nexercise it, is always in proportion to the necessity they are under of\nmaking that exertion. This necessity is greatest with those to whom the\nemoluments of their profession are the only source from which they expect\ntheir fortune, or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence. In order to\nacquire this fortune, or even to get this subsistence, they must, in the\ncourse of a year, execute a certain quantity of work of a known value;\nand, where the competition is free, the rivalship of competitors, who are\nall endeavouring to justle one another out of employment, obliges every\nman to endeavour to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness.\nThe greatness of the objects which are to be acquired by success in some\nparticular professions may, no doubt, sometimes animate the exertions of a\nfew men of extraordinary spirit and ambition. Great objects, however, are\nevidently not necessary, in order to occasion the greatest exertions.\nRivalship and emulation render excellency, even in mean professions, an\nobject of ambition, and frequently occasion the very greatest exertions.\nGreat objects, on the contrary, alone and unsupported by the necessity of\napplication, have seldom been sufficient to occasion any considerable\nexertion. In England, success in the profession of the law leads to some\nvery great objects of ambition; and yet how few men, born to easy\nfortunes, have ever in this country been eminent in that profession?\nThe endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished, more\nor less, the necessity of application in the teachers. Their subsistence,\nso far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund,\naltogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular\nprofessions.\nIn some universities, the salary makes but a part, and frequently but a\nsmall part, of the emoluments of the teacher, of which the greater part\narises from the honoraries or fees of his pupils. The necessity of\napplication, though always more or less diminished, is not, in this case,\nentirely taken away. Reputation in his profession is still of some\nimportance to him, and he still has some dependency upon the affection,\ngratitude, and favourable report of those who have attended upon his\ninstructions; and these favourable sentiments he is likely to gain in no\nway so well as by deserving them, that is, by the abilities and diligence\nwith which he discharges every part of his duty.\nIn other universities, the teacher is prohibited from receiving any\nhonorary or fee from his pupils, and his salary constitutes the whole of\nthe revenue which he derives from his office. His interest is, in this\ncase, set as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set\nit. It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can;\nand if his emoluments are to be precisely the same, whether he does or\ndoes not perform some very laborious duty, it is certainly his interest,\nat least as interest is vulgarly understood, either to neglect it\naltogether, or, if he is subject to some authority which will not suffer\nhim to do this, to perform it in as careless and slovenly a manner as that\nauthority will permit. If he is naturally active and a lover of labour, it\nis his interest to employ that activity in any way from which he can\nderive some advantage, rather than in the performance of his duty, from\nwhich he can derive none.\nIf the authority to which he is subject resides in the body corporate, the\ncollege, or university, of which he himself is a member, and in which the\ngreater part of the other members are, like himself, persons who either\nare, or ought to be teachers, they are likely to make a common cause, to\nbe all very indulgent to one another, and every man to consent that his\nneighbour may neglect his duty, provided he himself is allowed to neglect\nhis own. In the university of Oxford, the greater part of the public\nprofessors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the\npretence of teaching.\nIf the authority to which he is subject resides, not so much in the body\ncorporate, of which he is a member, as in some other extraneous persons,\nin the bishop of the diocese, for example, in the governor of the\nprovince, or, perhaps, in some minister of state, it is not, indeed, in\nthis case, very likely that he will be suffered to neglect his duty\naltogether. All that such superiors, however, can force him to do, is to\nattend upon his pupils a certain number of hours, that is, to give a\ncertain number of lectures in the week, or in the year. What those\nlectures shall be, must still depend upon the diligence of the teacher;\nand that diligence is likely to be proportioned to the motives which he\nhas for exerting it. An extraneous jurisdiction of this kind, besides, is\nliable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously. In its nature, it\nis arbitrary and discretionary; and the persons who exercise it, neither\nattending upon the lectures of the teacher themselves, nor perhaps\nunderstanding the sciences which it is his business to teach, are seldom\ncapable of exercising it with judgment. From the insolence of office, too,\nthey are frequently indifferent how they exercise it, and are very apt to\ncensure or deprive him of his office wantonly and without any just cause.\nThe person subject to such jurisdiction is necessarily degraded by it,\nand, instead of being one of the most respectable, is rendered one of the\nmeanest and most contemptible persons in the society. It is by powerful\nprotection only, that he can effectually guard himself against the bad\nusage to which he is at all times exposed; and this protection he is most\nlikely to gain, not by ability or diligence in his profession, but by\nobsequiousness to the will of his superiors, and by being ready, at all\ntimes, to sacrifice to that will the rights, the interest, and the honour\nof the body corporate, of which he is a member. Whoever has attended for\nany considerable time to the administration of a French university, must\nhave had occasion to remark the effects which naturally result from an\narbitrary and extraneous jurisdiction of this kind.\nWhatever forces a certain number of students to any college or university,\nindependent of the merit or reputation of the teachers, tends more or less\nto diminish the necessity of that merit or reputation.\nThe privileges of graduates in arts, in law, physic, and divinity, when\nthey can be obtained only by residing a certain number of years in certain\nuniversities, necessarily force a certain number of students to such\nuniversities, independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers. The\nprivileges of graduates are a sort of statutes of apprenticeship, which\nhave contributed to the improvement of education just as the other\nstatutes of apprenticeship have to that of arts and manufactures.\nThe charitable foundations of scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries, etc.\nnecessarily attach a certain number of students to certain colleges,\nindependent altogether of the merit of those particular colleges. Were the\nstudents upon such charitable foundations left free to choose what college\nthey liked best, such liberty might perhaps contribute to excite some\nemulation among different colleges. A regulation, on the contrary, which\nprohibited even the independent members of every particular college from\nleaving it, and going to any other, without leave first asked and obtained\nof that which they meant to abandon, would tend very much to extinguish\nthat emulation.\nIf in each college, the tutor or teacher, who was to instruct each student\nin all arts and sciences, should not be voluntarily chosen by the student,\nbut appointed by the head of the college; and if, in case of neglect,\ninability, or bad usage, the student should not be allowed to change him\nfor another, without leave first asked and obtained; such a regulation\nwould not only tend very much to extinguish all emulation among the\ndifferent tutors of the same college, but to diminish very much, in all of\nthem, the necessity of diligence and of attention to their respective\npupils. Such teachers, though very well paid by their students, might be\nas much disposed to neglect them, as those who are not paid by them at all\nor who have no other recompense but their salary.\nIf the teacher happens to be a man of sense, it must be an unpleasant\nthing to him to be conscious, while he is lecturing to his students, that\nhe is either speaking or reading nonsense, or what is very little better\nthan nonsense. It must, too, be unpleasant to him to observe, that the\ngreater part of his students desert his lectures; or perhaps, attend upon\nthem with plain enough marks of neglect, contempt, and derision. If he is\nobliged, therefore, to give a certain number of lectures, these motives\nalone, without any other interest, might dispose him to take some pains to\ngive tolerably good ones. Several different expedients, however, may be\nfallen upon, which will effectually blunt the edge of all those\nincitements to diligence. The teacher, instead of explaining to his pupils\nhimself the science in which he proposes to instruct them, may read some\nbook upon it; and if this book is written in a foreign and dead language,\nby interpreting it to them into their own, or, what would give him still\nless trouble, by making them interpret it to him, and by now and then\nmaking an occasional remark upon it, he may flatter himself that he is\ngiving a lecture. The slightest degree of knowledge and application will\nenable him to do this, without exposing himself to contempt or derision,\nby saying any thing that is really foolish, absurd, or ridiculous. The\ndiscipline of the college, at the same time, may enable him to force all\nhis pupils to the most regular attendance upon his sham lecture, and to\nmaintain the most decent and respectful behaviour during the whole time of\nthe performance.\nThe discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not\nfor the benefit of the students, but for the interest, or, more properly\nspeaking, for the ease of the masters. Its object is, in all cases, to\nmaintain the authority of the master, and, whether he neglects or performs\nhis duty, to oblige the students in all cases to behave to him as if he\nperformed it with the greatest diligence and ability. It seems to presume\nperfect wisdom and virtue in the one order, and the greatest weakness and\nfolly in the other. Where the masters, however, really perform their duty,\nthere are no examples, I believe, that the greater part of the students\never neglect theirs. No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance\nupon lectures which are really worth the attending, as is well known\nwherever any such lectures are given. Force and restraint may, no doubt,\nbe in some degree requisite, in order to oblige children, or very young\nboys, to attend to those parts of education, which it is thought necessary\nfor them to acquire during that early period of life; but after twelve or\nthirteen years of age, provided the master does his duty, force or\nrestraint can scarce ever be necessary to carry on any part of education.\nSuch is the generosity of the greater part of young men, that so far from\nbeing disposed to neglect or despise the instructions of their master,\nprovided he shews some serious intention of being of use to them, they are\ngenerally inclined to pardon a great deal of incorrectness in the\nperformance of his duty, and sometimes even to conceal from the public a\ngood deal of gross negligence.\nThose parts of education, it is to be observed, for the teaching of which\nthere are no public institutions, are generally the best taught. When a\nyoung man goes to a fencing or a dancing school, he does not, indeed,\nalways learn to fence or to dance very well; but he seldom fails of\nlearning to fence or to dance. The good effects of the riding school are\nnot commonly so evident. The expense of a riding school is so great, that\nin most places it is a public institution. The three most essential parts\nof literary education, to read, write, and account, it still continues to\nbe more common to acquire in private than in public schools; and it very\nseldom happens, that anybody fails of acquiring them to the degree in\nwhich it is necessary to acquire them.\nIn England, the public schools are much less corrupted than the\nuniversities. In the schools, the youth are taught, or at least may be\ntaught, Greek and Latin; that is, everything which the masters pretend to\nteach, or which it is expected they should teach. In the universities, the\nyouth neither are taught, nor always can find any proper means of being\ntaught the sciences, which it is the business of those incorporated bodies\nto teach. The reward of the schoolmaster, in most cases, depends\nprincipally, in some cases almost entirely, upon the fees or honoraries of\nhis scholars. Schools have no exclusive privileges. In order to obtain the\nhonours of graduation, it is not necessary that a person should bring a\ncertificate of his having studied a certain number of years at a public\nschool. If, upon examination, he appears to understand what is taught\nthere, no questions are asked about the place where he learnt it.\nThe parts of education which are commonly taught in universities, it may\nperhaps be said, are not very well taught. But had it not been for those\ninstitutions, they would not have been commonly taught at all; and both\nthe individual and the public would have suffered a good deal from the\nwant of those important parts of education.\nThe present universities of Europe were originally, the greater part of\nthem, ecclesiastical corporations, instituted for the education of\nchurchmen. They were founded by the authority of the pope; and were so\nentirely under his immediate protection, that their members, whether\nmasters or students, had all of them what was then called the benefit of\nclergy, that is, were exempted from the civil jurisdiction of the\ncountries in which their respective universities were situated, and were\namenable only to the ecclesiastical tribunals. What was taught in the\ngreater part of those universities was suitable to the end of their\ninstitution, either theology, or something that was merely preparatory to\ntheology.\nWhen Christianity was first established by law, a corrupted Latin had\nbecome the common language of all the western parts of Europe. The service\nof the church, accordingly, and the translation of the Bible which were\nread in churches, were both in that corrupted Latin; that is, in the\ncommon language of the country, After the irruption of the barbarous\nnations who overturned the Roman empire, Latin gradually ceased to be the\nlanguage of any part of Europe. But the reverence of the people naturally\npreserves the established forms and ceremonies of religion long after the\ncircumstances which first introduced and rendered them reasonable, are no\nmore. Though Latin, therefore, was no longer understood anywhere by the\ngreat body of the people, the whole service of the church still continued\nto be performed in that language. Two different languages were thus\nestablished in Europe, in the same manner as in ancient Egypt: a language\nof the priests, and a language of the people; a sacred and a profane, a\nlearned and an unlearned language. But it was necessary that the priests\nshould understand something of that sacred and learned language in which\nthey were to officiate; and the study of the Latin language therefore\nmade, from the beginning, an essential part of university education.\nIt was not so with that either of the Greek or of the Hebrew language. The\ninfallible decrees of the church had pronounced the Latin translation of\nthe Bible, commonly called the Latin Vulgate, to have been equally\ndictated by divine inspiration, and therefore of equal authority with the\nGreek and Hebrew originals. The knowledge of those two languages,\ntherefore, not being indispensably requisite to a churchman, the study of\nthem did not for a long time make a necessary part of the common course of\nuniversity education. There are some Spanish universities, I am assured,\nin which the study of the Greek language has never yet made any part of\nthat course. The first reformers found the Greek text of the New\nTestament, and even the Hebrew text of the Old, more favourable to their\nopinions than the vulgate translation, which, as might naturally be\nsupposed, had been gradually accommodated to support the doctrines of the\nCatholic Church. They set themselves, therefore, to expose the many errors\nof that translation, which the Roman catholic clergy were thus put under\nthe necessity of defending or explaining. But this could not well be done\nwithout some knowledge of the original languages, of which the study was\ntherefore gradually introduced into the greater part of universities; both\nof those which embraced, and of those which rejected, the doctrines of the\nreformation. The Greek language was connected with every part of that\nclassical learning, which, though at first principally cultivated by\ncatholics and Italians, happened to come into fashion much about the same\ntime that the doctrines of the reformation were set on foot. In the\ngreater part of universities, therefore, that language was taught previous\nto the study of philosophy, and as soon as the student had made some\nprogress in the Latin. The Hebrew language having no connection with\nclassical learning, and, except the Holy Scriptures, being the language of\nnot a single book in any esteem the study of it did not commonly commence\ntill after that of philosophy, and when the student had entered upon the\nstudy of theology.\nOriginally, the first rudiments, both of the Greek and Latin languages,\nwere taught in universities; and in some universities they still continue\nto be so. In others, it is expected that the student should have\npreviously acquired, at least, the rudiments of one or both of those\nlanguages, of which the study continues to make everywhere a very\nconsiderable part of university education.\nThe ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three great branches;\nphysics, or natural philosophy; ethics, or moral philosophy; and logic.\nThis general division seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things.\nThe great phenomena of nature, the revolutions of the heavenly bodies,\neclipses, comets; thunder and lightning, and other extraordinary meteors;\nthe generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals;\nare objects which, as they necessarily excite the wonder, so they\nnaturally call forth the curiosity of mankind to inquire into their\ncauses. Superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by\nreferring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the\ngods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more\nfamiliar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with, than\nthe agency of the gods. As those great phenomena are the first objects of\nhuman curiosity, so the science which pretends to explain them must\nnaturally have been the first branch of philosophy that was cultivated.\nThe first philosophers, accordingly, of whom history has preserved any\naccount, appear to have been natural philosophers.\nIn every age and country of the world, men must have attended to the\ncharacters, designs, and actions of one another; and many reputable rules\nand maxims for the conduct of human life must have been laid down and\napproved of by common consent. As soon as writing came into fashion, wise\nmen, or those who fancied themselves such, would naturally endeavour to\nincrease the number of those established and respected maxims, and to\nexpress their own sense of what was either proper or improper conduct,\nsometimes in the more artificial form of apologues, like what are called\nthe fables of Aesop; and sometimes in the more simple one of apophthegms\nor wise sayings, like the proverbs of Solomon, the verses of Theognis and\nPhocyllides, and some part of the works of Hesiod. They might continue in\nthis manner, for a long time, merely to multiply the number of those\nmaxims of prudence and morality, without even attempting to arrange them\nin any very distinct or methodical order, much less to connect them\ntogether by one or more general principles, from which they were all\ndeducible, like effects from their natural causes. The beauty of a\nsystematical arrangement of different observations, connected by a few\ncommon principles, was first seen in the rude essays of those ancient\ntimes towards a system of natural philosophy. Something of the same kind\nwas afterwards attempted in morals. The maxims of common life were\narranged in some methodical order, and connected together by a few common\nprinciples, in the same manner as they had attempted to arrange and\nconnect the phenomena of nature. The science which pretends to investigate\nand explain those connecting principles, is what is properly called Moral\nPhilosophy.\nDifferent authors gave different systems, both of natural and moral\nphilosophy. But the arguments by which they supported those different\nsystems, far from being always demonstrations, were frequently at best but\nvery slender probabilities, and sometimes mere sophisms, which had no\nother foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language.\nSpeculative systems, have, in all ages of the world, been adopted for\nreasons too frivolous to have determined the judgment of any man of common\nsense, in a matter of the smallest pecuniary interest. Gross sophistry has\nscarce ever had any influence upon the opinions of mankind, except in\nmatters of philosophy and speculation; and in these it has frequently had\nthe greatest. The patrons of each system of natural and moral philosophy,\nnaturally endeavoured to expose the weakness of the arguments adduced to\nsupport the systems which were opposite to their own. In examining those\narguments, they were necessarily led to consider the difference between a\nprobable and a demonstrative argument, between a fallacious and a\nconclusive one; and logic, or the science of the general principles of\ngood and bad reasoning, necessarily arose out of the observations which a\nscrutiny of this kind gave occasion to; though, in its origin, posterior\nboth to physics and to ethics, it was commonly taught, not indeed in all,\nbut in the greater part of the ancient schools of philosophy, previously\nto either of those sciences. The student, it seems to have been thought,\nought to understand well the difference between good and bad reasoning,\nbefore he was led to reason upon subjects of so great importance.\nThis ancient division of philosophy into three parts was, in the greater\npart of the universities of Europe, changed for another into five.\nIn the ancient philosophy, whatever was taught concerning the nature\neither of the human mind or of the Deity, made a part of the system of\nphysics. Those beings, in whatever their essence might be supposed to\nconsist, were parts of the great system of the universe, and parts, too,\nproductive of the most important effects. Whatever human reason could\neither conclude or conjecture concerning them, made, as it were, two\nchapters, though no doubt two very important ones, of the science which\npretended to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great\nsystem of the universe. But in the universities of Europe, where\nphilosophy was taught only as subservient to theology, it was natural to\ndwell longer upon these two chapters than upon any other of the science.\nThey were gradually more and more extended, and were divided into many\ninferior chapters; till at last the doctrine of spirits, of which so\nlittle can be known, came to take up as much room in the system of\nphilosophy as the doctrine of bodies, of which so much can be known. The\ndoctrines concerning those two subjects were considered as making two\ndistinct sciences. What are called metaphysics, or pneumatics, were set in\nopposition to physics, and were cultivated not only as the more sublime,\nbut, for the purposes of a particular profession, as the more useful\nscience of the two. The proper subject of experiment and observation, a\nsubject in which a careful attention is capable of making so many useful\ndiscoveries, was almost entirely neglected. The subject in which, after a\nvery few simple and almost obvious truths, the most careful attention can\ndiscover nothing but obscurity and uncertainty, and can consequently\nproduce nothing but subtleties and sophisms, was greatly cultivated.\nWhen those two sciences had thus been set in opposition to one another,\nthe comparison between them naturally gave birth to a third, to what was\ncalled ontology, or the science which treated of the qualities and\nattributes which were common to both the subjects of the other two\nsciences. But if subtleties and sophisms composed the greater part of the\nmetaphysics or pneumatics of the schools, they composed the whole of this\ncobweb science of ontology, which was likewise sometimes called\nmetaphysics.\nWherein consisted the happiness and perfection of a man, considered not\nonly as an individual, but as the member of a family, of a state, and of\nthe great society of mankind, was the object which the ancient moral\nphilosophy proposed to investigate. In that philosophy, the duties of\nhuman life were treated of as subservient to the happiness and perfection\nof human life, But when moral, as well as natural philosophy, came to be\ntaught only as subservient to theology, the duties of human life were\ntreated of as chiefly subservient to the happiness of a life to come. In\nthe ancient philosophy, the perfection of virtue was represented as\nnecessarily productive, to the person who possessed it, of the most\nperfect happiness in this life. In the modern philosophy, it was\nfrequently represented as generally, or rather as almost always,\ninconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life; and heaven was to\nbe earned only by penance and mortification, by the austerities and\nabasement of a monk, not by the liberal, generous, and spirited conduct of\na man. Casuistry, and an ascetic morality, made up, in most cases, the\ngreater part of the moral philosophy of the schools. By far the most\nimportant of all the different branches of philosophy became in this\nmanner by far the most corrupted.\nSuch, therefore, was the common course of philosophical education in the\ngreater part of the universities in Europe. Logic was taught first;\nontology came in the second place; pneumatology, comprehending the\ndoctrine concerning the nature of the human soul and of the Deity, in the\nthird; in the fourth followed a debased system of moral philosophy, which\nwas considered as immediately connected with the doctrines of\npneumatology, with the immortality of the human soul, and with the rewards\nand punishments which, from the justice of the Deity, were to be expected\nin a life to come: a short and superficial system of physics usually\nconcluded the course.\nThe alterations which the universities of Europe thus introduced into the\nancient course of philosophy were all meant for the education of\necclesiastics, and to render it a more proper introduction to the study of\ntheology. But the additional quantity of subtlety and sophistry, the\ncasuistry and ascetic morality which those alterations introduced into it,\ncertainly did not render it more for the education of gentlemen or men of\nthe world, or more likely either to improve the understanding or to mend\nthe heart.\nThis course of philosophy is what still continues to be taught in the\ngreater part of the universities of Europe, with more or less diligence,\naccording as the constitution of each particular university happens to\nrender diligence more or less necessary to the teachers. In some of the\nrichest and best endowed universities, the tutors content themselves with\nteaching a few unconnected shreds and parcels of this corrupted course;\nand even these they commonly teach very negligently and superficially.\nThe improvements which, in modern times have been made in several\ndifferent branches of philosophy, have not, the greater part of them, been\nmade in universities, though some, no doubt, have. The greater part of\nuniversities have not even been very forward to adopt those improvements\nafter they were made; and several of those learned societies have chosen\nto remain, for a long time, the sanctuaries in which exploded systems and\nobsolete prejudices found shelter and protection, after they had been\nhunted out of every other corner of the world. In general, the richest and\nbest endowed universities have been slowest in adopting those\nimprovements, and the most averse to permit any considerable change in the\nestablished plan of education. Those improvements were more easily\nintroduced into some of the poorer universities, in which the teachers,\ndepending upon their reputation for the greater part of their subsistence,\nwere obliged to pay more attention to the current opinions of the world.\nBut though the public schools and universities of Europe were originally\nintended only for the education of a particular profession, that of\nchurchmen; and though they were not always very diligent in instructing\ntheir pupils, even in the sciences which were supposed necessary for that\nprofession; yet they gradually drew to themselves the education of almost\nall other people, particularly of almost all gentlemen and men of fortune.\nNo better method, it seems, could be fallen upon, of spending, with any\nadvantage, the long interval between infancy and that period of life at\nwhich men begin to apply in good earnest to the real business of the\nworld, the business which is to employ them during the remainder of their\ndays. The greater part of what is taught in schools and universities,\nhowever, does not seem to be the most proper preparation for that\nbusiness.\nIn England, it becomes every day more and more the custom to send young\npeople to travel in foreign countries immediately upon their leaving\nschool, and without sending them to any university. Our young people, it\nis said, generally return home much improved by their travels. A young\nman, who goes abroad at seventeen or eighteen, and returns home at\none-and-twenty, returns three or four years older than he was when he went\nabroad; and at that age it is very difficult not to improve a good deal in\nthree or four years. In the course of his travels, he generally acquires\nsome knowledge of one or two foreign languages; a knowledge, however,\nwhich is seldom sufficient to enable him either to speak or write them\nwith propriety. In other respects, he commonly returns home more\nconceited, more unprincipled, more dissipated, and more incapable of any\nserious application, either to study or to business, than he could well\nhave become in so short a time had he lived at home. By travelling so very\nyoung, by spending in the most frivolous dissipation the most precious\nyears of his life, at a distance from the inspection and control of his\nparents and relations, every useful habit, which the earlier parts of his\neducation might have had some tendency to form in him, instead of being\nriveted and confirmed, is almost necessarily either weakened or effaced.\nNothing but the discredit into which the universities are allowing\nthemselves to fall, could ever have brought into repute so very absurd a\npractice as that of travelling at this early period of life. By sending\nhis son abroad, a father delivers himself, at least for some time, from so\ndisagreeable an object as that of a son unemployed, neglected, and going\nto ruin before his eyes.\nSuch have been the effects of some of the modern institutions for\neducation.\nDifferent plans and different institutions for education seem to have\ntaken place in other ages and nations.\nIn the republics of ancient Greece, every free citizen was instructed,\nunder the direction of the public magistrate, in gymnastic exercises and\nin music. By gymnastic exercises, it was intended to harden his body, to\nsharpen his courage, and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers of\nwar; and as the Greek militia was, by all accounts, one of the best that\never was in the world, this part of their public education must have\nanswered completely the purpose for which it was intended. By the other\npart, music, it was proposed, at least by the philosophers and historians,\nwho have given us an account of those institutions, to humanize the mind,\nto soften the temper, and to dispose it for performing all the social and\nmoral duties of public and private life.\nIn ancient Rome, the exercises of the Campus Martius answered the same\npurpose as those of the Gymnasium in ancient Greece, and they seem to have\nanswered it equally well. But among the Romans there was nothing which\ncorresponded to the musical education of the Greeks. The morals of the\nRomans, however, both in private and public life, seem to have been, not\nonly equal, but, upon the whole, a good deal superior to those of the\nGreeks. That they were superior in private life, we have the express\ntestimony of Polybius, and of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, two authors well\nacquainted with both nations; and the whole tenor of the Greek and Roman\nhistory bears witness to the superiority of the public morals of the\nRomans. The good temper and moderation of contending factions seem to be\nthe most essential circumstances in the public morals of a free people.\nBut the factions of the Greeks were almost always violent and sanguinary;\nwhereas, till the time of the Gracchi, no blood had ever been shed in any\nRoman faction; and from the time of the Gracchi, the Roman republic may be\nconsidered as in reality dissolved. Notwithstanding, therefore, the very\nrespectable authority of Plato, Aristotle, and Polybius, and\nnotwithstanding the very ingenious reasons by which Mr Montesquieu\nendeavours to support that authority, it seems probable that the musical\neducation of the Greeks had no great effect in mending their morals,\nsince, without any such education, those of the Romans were, upon the\nwhole, superior. The respect of those ancient sages for the institutions\nof their ancestors had probably disposed them to find much political\nwisdom in what was, perhaps, merely an ancient custom, continued, without\ninterruption, from the earliest period of those societies, to the times in\nwhich they had arrived at a considerable degree of refinement. Music and\ndancing are the great amusements of almost all barbarous nations, and the\ngreat accomplishments which are supposed to fit any man for entertaining\nhis society. It is so at this day among the negroes on the coast of\nAfrica. It was so among the ancient Celtes, among the ancient\nScandinavians, and, as we may learn from Homer, among the ancient Greeks,\nin the times preceding the Trojan war. When the Greek tribes had formed\nthemselves into little republics, it was natural that the study of those\naccomplishments should for a long time make a part of the public and\ncommon education of the people.\nThe masters who instructed the young people, either in music or in\nmilitary exercises, do not seem to have been paid, or even appointed by\nthe state, either in Rome or even at Athens, the Greek republic of whose\nlaws and customs we are the best informed. The state required that every\nfree citizen should fit himself for defending it in war, and should upon\nthat account, learn his military exercises. But it left him to learn them\nof such masters as he could find; and it seems to have advanced nothing\nfor this purpose, but a public field or place of exercise, in which he\nshould practise and perform them.\nIn the early ages, both of the Greek and Roman republics, the other parts\nof education seem to have consisted in learning to read, write, and\naccount, according to the arithmetic of the times. These accomplishments\nthe richer citizens seem frequently to have acquired at home, by the\nassistance of some domestic pedagogue, who was, generally, either a slave\nor a freedman; and the poorer citizens in the schools of such masters as\nmade a trade of teaching for hire. Such parts of education, however, were\nabandoned altogether to the care of the parents or guardians of each\nindividual. It does not appear that the state ever assumed any inspection\nor direction of them. By a law of Solon, indeed, the children were\nacquitted from maintaining those parents who had neglected to instruct\nthem in some profitable trade or business.\nIn the progress of refinement, when philosophy and rhetoric came into\nfashion, the better sort of people used to send their children to the\nschools of philosophers and rhetoricians, in order to be instructed in\nthese fashionable sciences. But those schools were not supported by the\npublic. They were, for a long time, barely tolerated by it. The demand for\nphilosophy and rhetoric was, for a long time, so small, that the first\nprofessed teachers of either could not find constant employment in any one\ncity, but were obliged to travel about from place to place. In this manner\nlived Zeno of Elea, Protagoras, Gorgias, Hippias, and many others. As the\ndemand increased, the school, both of philosophy and rhetoric, became\nstationary, first in Athens, and afterwards in several other cities. The\nstate, however, seems never to have encouraged them further, than by\nassigning to some of them a particular place to teach in, which was\nsometimes done, too, by private donors. The state seems to have assigned\nthe Academy to Plato, the Lyceum to Aristotle, and the Portico to Zeno of\nCitta, the founder of the Stoics. But Epicurus bequeathed his gardens to\nhis own school. Till about the time of Marcus Antoninus, however, no\nteacher appears to have had any salary from the public, or to have had any\nother emoluments, but what arose from the honoraries or fees of his\nscholars. The bounty which that philosophical emperor, as we learn from\nLucian, bestowed upon one of the teachers of philosophy, probably lasted\nno longer than his own life. There was nothing equivalent to the\nprivileges of graduation; and to have attended any of those schools was\nnot necessary, in order to be permitted to practise any particular trade\nor profession. If the opinion of their own utility could not draw scholars\nto them, the law neither forced anybody to go to them, nor rewarded\nanybody for having gone to them. The teachers had no jurisdiction over\ntheir pupils, nor any other authority besides that natural authority which\nsuperior virtue and abilities never fail to procure from young people\ntowards those who are entrusted with any part of their education.\nAt Rome, the study of the civil law made a part of the education, not of\nthe greater part of the citizens, but of some particular families. The\nyoung people, however, who wished to acquire knowledge in the law, had no\npublic school to go to, and had no other method of studying it, than by\nfrequenting the company of such of their relations and friends as were\nsupposed to understand it. It is, perhaps, worth while to remark, that\nthough the laws of the twelve tables were many of them copied from those\nof some ancient Greek republics, yet law never seems to have grown up to\nbe a science in any republic of ancient Greece. In Rome it became a\nscience very early, and gave a considerable degree of illustration to\nthose citizens who had the reputation of understanding it. In the\nrepublics of ancient Greece, particularly in Athens, the ordinary courts\nof justice consisted of numerous, and therefore disorderly, bodies of\npeople, who frequently decided almost at random, or as clamour, faction,\nand party-spirit, happened to determine. The ignominy of an unjust\ndecision, when it was to be divided among five hundred, a thousand, or\nfifteen hundred people (for some of their courts were so very numerous),\ncould not fall very heavy upon any individual. At Rome, on the contrary,\nthe principal courts of justice consisted either of a single judge, or of\na small number of judges, whose characters, especially as they deliberated\nalways in public, could not fail to be very much affected by any rash or\nunjust decision. In doubtful cases such courts, from their anxiety to\navoid blame, would naturally endeavour to shelter themselves under the\nexample or precedent of the judges who had sat before them, either in the\nsame or in some other court. This attention to practice and precedent,\nnecessarily formed the Roman law into that regular and orderly system in\nwhich it has been delivered down to us; and the like attention has had the\nlike effects upon the laws of every other country where such attention has\ntaken place. The superiority of character in the Romans over that of the\nGreeks, so much remarked by Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, was\nprobably more owing to the better constitution of their courts of justice,\nthan to any of the circumstances to which those authors ascribe it. The\nRomans are said to have been particularly distinguished for their superior\nrespect to an oath. But the people who were accustomed to make oath only\nbefore some diligent and well informed court of justice, would naturally\nbe much more attentive to what they swore, than they who were accustomed\nto do the same thing before mobbish and disorderly assemblies.\nThe abilities, both civil and military, of the Greeks and Romans, will\nreadily be allowed to have been at least equal to those of any modern\nnation. Our prejudice is perhaps rather to overrate them. But except in\nwhat related to military exercises, the state seems to have been at no\npains to form those great abilities; for I cannot be induced to believe\nthat the musical education of the Greeks could be of much consequence in\nforming them. Masters, however, had been found, it seems, for instructing\nthe better sort of people among those nations, in every art and science in\nwhich the circumstances of their society rendered it necessary or\nconvenient for them to be instructed. The demand for such instruction\nproduced, what it always produces, the talent for giving it; and the\nemulation which an unrestrained competition never fails to excite, appears\nto have brought that talent to a very high degree of perfection. In the\nattention which the ancient philosophers excited, in the empire which they\nacquired over the opinions and principles of their auditors, in the\nfaculty which they possessed of giving a certain tone and character to the\nconduct and conversation of those auditors, they appear to have been much\nsuperior to any modern teachers. In modern times, the diligence of public\nteachers is more or less corrupted by the circumstances which render them\nmore or less independent of their success and reputation in their\nparticular professions. Their salaries, too, put the private teacher, who\nwould pretend to come into competition with them, in the same state with a\nmerchant who attempts to trade without a bounty, in competition with those\nwho trade with a considerable one. If he sells his goods at nearly the\nsame price, he cannot have the same profit; and poverty and beggary at\nleast, if not bankruptcy and ruin, will infallibly be his lot. If he\nattempts to sell them much dearer, he is likely to have so few customers,\nthat his circumstances will not be much mended. The privileges of\ngraduation, besides, are in many countries necessary, or at least\nextremely convenient, to most men of learned professions, that is, to the\nfar greater part of those who have occasion for a learned education. But\nthose privileges can be obtained only by attending the lectures of the\npublic teachers. The most careful attendance upon the ablest instructions\nof any private teacher cannot always give any title to demand them. It is\nfrom these different causes that the private teacher of any of the\nsciences, which are commonly taught in universities, is, in modern times,\ngenerally considered as in the very lowest order of men of letters. A man\nof real abilities can scarce find out a more humiliating or a more\nunprofitable employment to turn them to. The endowments of schools and\ncolleges have in this manner not only corrupted the diligence of public\nteachers, but have rendered it almost impossible to have any good private\nones.\nWere there no public institutions for education, no system, no science,\nwould be taught, for which there was not some demand, or which the\ncircumstances of the times did not render it either necessary or\nconvenient, or at least fashionable to learn. A private teacher could\nnever find his account in teaching either an exploded and antiquated\nsystem of a science acknowledged to be useful, or a science universally\nbelieved to be a mere useless and pedantic heap of sophistry and nonsense.\nSuch systems, such sciences, can subsist nowhere but in those incorporated\nsocieties for education, whose prosperity and revenue are in a great\nmeasure independent of their industry. Were there no public institutions\nfor education, a gentleman, after going through, with application and\nabilities, the most complete course of education which the circumstances\nof the times were supposed to afford, could not come into the world\ncompletely ignorant of everything which is the common subject of\nconversation among gentlemen and men of the world.\nThere are no public institutions for the education of women, and there is\naccordingly nothing useless, absurd, or fantastical, in the common course\nof their education. They are taught what their parents or guardians judge\nit necessary or useful for them to learn, and they are taught nothing\nelse. Every part of their education tends evidently to some useful\npurpose; either to improve the natural attractions of their person, or to\nform their mind to reserve, to modesty, to chastity, and to economy; to\nrender them both likely to became the mistresses of a family, and to\nbehave properly when they have become such. In every part of her life, a\nwoman feels some conveniency or advantage from every part of her\neducation. It seldom happens that a man, in any part of his life, derives\nany conveniency or advantage from some of the most laborious and\ntroublesome parts of his education.\nOught the public, therefore, to give no attention, it may be asked, to the\neducation of the people? Or, if it ought to give any, what are the\ndifferent parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different\norders of the people? and in what manner ought it to attend to them?\nIn some cases, the state of society necessarily places the greater part of\nindividuals in such situations as naturally form in them, without any\nattention of government, almost all the abilities and virtues which that\nstate requires, or perhaps can admit of. In other cases, the state of the\nsociety does not place the greater part of individuals in such situations;\nand some attention of government is necessary, in order to prevent the\nalmost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people.\nIn the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far\ngreater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of\nthe people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations;\nfrequently to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of\nmen are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose\nwhole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the\neffects, too, are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no\noccasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention, in\nfinding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He\nnaturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally\nbecomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to\nbecome. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing\nor bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any\ngenerous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just\njudgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of\nthe great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether\nincapable of judging; and unless very particular pains have been taken to\nrender him otherwise, he is equally incapable of defending his country in\nwar. The uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage\nof his mind, and makes him regard, with abhorrence, the irregular,\nuncertain, and adventurous life of a soldier. It corrupts even the\nactivity of his body, and renders him incapable of exerting his strength\nwith vigour and perseverance in any other employment, than that to which\nhe has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this\nmanner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and\nmartial virtues. But in every improved and civilized society, this is the\nstate into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the\npeople, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to\nprevent it.\nIt is otherwise in the barbarous societies, as they are commonly called,\nof hunters, of shepherds, and even of husbandmen in that rude state of\nhusbandry which precedes the improvement of manufactures, and the\nextension of foreign commerce. In such societies, the varied occupations\nof every man oblige every man to exert his capacity, and to invent\nexpedients for removing difficulties which are continually occurring.\nInvention is kept alive, and the mind is not suffered to fall into that\ndrowsy stupidity, which, in a civilized society, seems to benumb the\nunderstanding of almost all the inferior ranks of people. In those\nbarbarous societies, as they are called, every man, it has already been\nobserved, is a warrior. Every man, too, is in some measure a statesman,\nand can form a tolerable judgment concerning the interest of the society,\nand the conduct of those who govern it. How far their chiefs are good\njudges in peace, or good leaders in war, is obvious to the observation of\nalmost every single man among them. In such a society, indeed, no man can\nwell acquire that improved and refined understanding which a few men\nsometimes possess in a more civilized state. Though in a rude society\nthere is a good deal of variety in the occupations of every individual,\nthere is not a great deal in those of the whole society. Every man does,\nor is capable of doing, almost every thing which any other man does, or is\ncapable of being. Every man has a considerable degree of knowledge,\ningenuity, and invention but scarce any man has a great degree. The\ndegree, however, which is commonly possessed, is generally sufficient for\nconducting the whole simple business of the society. In a civilized state,\non the contrary, though there is little variety in the occupations of the\ngreater part of individuals, there is an almost infinite variety in those\nof the whole society. These varied occupations present an almost infinite\nvariety of objects to the contemplation of those few, who, being attached\nto no particular occupation themselves, have leisure and inclination to\nexamine the occupations of other people. The contemplation of so great a\nvariety of objects necessarily exercises their minds in endless\ncomparisons and combinations, and renders their understandings, in an\nextraordinary degree, both acute and comprehensive. Unless those few,\nhowever, happen to be placed in some very particular situations, their\ngreat abilities, though honourable to themselves, may contribute very\nlittle to the good government or happiness of their society.\nNotwithstanding the great abilities of those few, all the nobler parts of\nthe human character may be, in a great measure, obliterated and\nextinguished in the great body of the people.\nThe education of the common people requires, perhaps, in a civilized and\ncommercial society, the attention of the public, more than that of people\nof some rank and fortune. People of some rank and fortune are generally\neighteen or nineteen years of age before they enter upon that particular\nbusiness, profession, or trade, by which they propose to distinguish\nthemselves in the world. They have, before that, full time to acquire, or\nat least to fit themselves for afterwards acquiring, every accomplishment\nwhich can recommend them to the public esteem, or render them worthy of\nit. Their parents or guardians are generally sufficiently anxious that\nthey should be so accomplished, and are in most cases, willing enough to\nlay out the expense which is necessary for that purpose. If they are not\nalways properly educated, it is seldom from the want of expense laid out\nupon their education, but from the improper application of that expense.\nIt is seldom from the want of masters, but from the negligence and\nincapacity of the masters who are to be had, and from the difficulty, or\nrather from the impossibility, which there is, in the present state of\nthings, of finding any better. The employments, too, in which people of\nsome rank or fortune spend the greater part of their lives, are not, like\nthose of the common people, simple and uniform. They are almost all of\nthem extremely complicated, and such as exercise the head more than the\nhands. The understandings of those who are engaged in such employments,\ncan seldom grow torpid for want of exercise. The employments of people of\nsome rank and fortune, besides, are seldom such as harass them from\nmorning to night. They generally have a good deal of leisure, during which\nthey may perfect themselves in every branch, either of useful or\nornamental knowledge, of which they may have laid the foundation, or for\nwhich they may have acquired some taste in the earlier part of life.\nIt is otherwise with the common people. They have little time to spare for\neducation. Their parents can scarce afford to maintain them, even in\ninfancy. As soon as they are able to work, they must apply to some trade,\nby which they can earn their subsistence. That trade, too, is generally so\nsimple and uniform, as to give little exercise to the understanding;\nwhile, at the same time, their labour is both so constant and so severe,\nthat it leaves them little leisure and less inclination to apply to, or\neven to think of any thing else.\nBut though the common people cannot, in any civilized society, be so well\ninstructed as people of some rank and fortune; the most essential parts of\neducation, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired at so\nearly a period of life, that the greater part, even of those who are to be\nbred to the lowest occupations, have time to acquire them before they can\nbe employed in those occupations. For a very small expense, the public can\nfacilitate, can encourage and can even impose upon almost the whole body\nof the people, the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of\neducation.\nThe public can facilitate this acquisition, by establishing in every\nparish or district a little school, where children maybe taught for a\nreward so moderate, that even a common labourer may afford it; the master\nbeing partly, but not wholly, paid by the public; because, if he was\nwholly, or even principally, paid by it, he would soon learn to neglect\nhis business. In Scotland, the establishment of such parish schools has\ntaught almost the whole common people to read, and a very great proportion\nof them to write and account. In England, the establishment of charity\nschools has had an effect of the same kind, though not so universally,\nbecause the establishment is not so universal. If, in those little\nschools, the books by which the children are taught to read, were a little\nmore instructive than they commonly are; and if, instead of a little\nsmattering in Latin, which the children of the common people are sometimes\ntaught there, and which can scarce ever be of any use to them, they were\ninstructed in the elementary parts of geometry and mechanics; the literary\neducation of this rank of people would, perhaps, be as complete as can be.\nThere is scarce a common trade, which does not afford some opportunities\nof applying to it the principles of geometry and mechanics, and which\nwould not, therefore, gradually exercise and improve the common people in\nthose principles, the necessary introduction to the most sublime, as well\nas to the most useful sciences.\nThe public can encourage the acquisition of those most essential parts of\neducation, by giving small premiums, and little badges of distinction, to\nthe children of the common people who excel in them.\nThe public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the\nnecessity of acquiring the most essential parts of education, by obliging\nevery man to undergo an examination or probation in them, before he can\nobtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to set up any trade,\neither in a village or town corporate.\nIt was in this manner, by facilitating the acquisition of their military\nand gymnastic exercises, by encouraging it, and even by imposing upon the\nwhole body of the people the necessity of learning those exercises, that\nthe Greek and Roman republics maintained the martial spirit of their\nrespective citizens. They facilitated the acquisition of those exercises,\nby appointing a certain place for learning and practising them, and by\ngranting to certain masters the privilege of teaching in that place. Those\nmasters do not appear to have had either salaries or exclusive privileges\nof any kind. Their reward consisted altogether in what they got from their\nscholars; and a citizen, who had learnt his exercises in the public\ngymnasia, had no sort of legal advantage over one who had learnt them\nprivately, provided the latter had learned them equally well. Those\nrepublics encouraged the acquisition of those exercises, by bestowing\nlittle premiums and badges of distinction upon those who excelled in them.\nTo have gained a prize in the Olympic, Isthmian, or Nemaean games, gave\nillustration, not only to the person who gained it, but to his whole\nfamily and kindred. The obligation which every citizen was under, to serve\na certain number of years, if called upon, in the armies of the republic,\nsufficiently imposed the necessity of learning those exercises, without\nwhich he could not be fit for that service.\nThat in the progress of improvement, the practice of military exercises,\nunless government takes proper pains to support it, goes gradually to\ndecay, and, together with it, the martial spirit of the great body of the\npeople, the example of modern Europe sufficiently demonstrates. But the\nsecurity of every society must always depend, more or less, upon the\nmartial spirit of the great body of the people. In the present times,\nindeed, that martial spirit alone, and unsupported by a well-disciplined\nstanding army, would not, perhaps, be sufficient for the defence and\nsecurity of any society. But where every citizen had the spirit of a\nsoldier, a smaller standing army would surely be requisite. That spirit,\nbesides, would necessarily diminish very much the dangers to liberty,\nwhether real or imaginary, which are commonly apprehended from a standing\narmy. As it would very much facilitate the operations of that army against\na foreign invader; so it would obstruct them as much, if unfortunately\nthey should ever be directed against the constitution of the state.\nThe ancient institutions of Greece and Rome seem to have been much more\neffectual for maintaining the martial spirit of the great body of the\npeople, than the establishment of what are called the militias of modern\ntimes. They were much more simple. When they were once established, they\nexecuted themselves, and it required little or no attention from\ngovernment to maintain them in the most perfect vigour. Whereas to\nmaintain, even in tolerable execution, the complex regulations of any\nmodern militia, requires the continual and painful attention of\ngovernment, without which they are constantly falling into total neglect\nand disuse. The influence, besides, of the ancient institutions, was much\nmore universal. By means of them, the whole body of the people was\ncompletely instructed in the use of arms; whereas it is but a very small\npart of them who can ever be so instructed by the regulations of any\nmodern militia, except, perhaps, that of Switzerland. But a coward, a man\nincapable either of defending or of revenging himself, evidently wants one\nof the most essential parts of the character of a man. He is as much\nmutilated and deformed in his mind as another is in his body, who is\neither deprived of some of its most essential members, or has lost the use\nof them. He is evidently the more wretched and miserable of the two;\nbecause happiness and misery, which reside altogether in the mind, must\nnecessarily depend more upon the healthful or unhealthful, the mutilated\nor entire state of the mind, than upon that of the body. Even though the\nmartial spirit of the people were of no use towards the defence of the\nsociety, yet, to prevent that sort of mental mutilation, deformity, and\nwretchedness, which cowardice necessarily involves in it, from spreading\nthemselves through the great body of the people, would still deserve the\nmost serious attention of government; in the same manner as it would\ndeserve its most serious attention to prevent a leprosy, or any other\nloathsome and offensive disease, though neither mortal nor dangerous, from\nspreading itself among them; though, perhaps, no other public good might\nresult from such attention, besides the prevention of so great a public\nevil.\nThe same thing may be said of the gross ignorance and stupidity which, in\na civilized society, seem so frequently to benumb the understandings of\nall the inferior ranks of people. A man without the proper use of the\nintellectual faculties of a man, is, if possible, more contemptible than\neven a coward, and seems to be mutilated and deformed in a still more\nessential part of the character of human nature. Though the state was to\nderive no advantage from the instruction of the inferior ranks of people,\nit would still deserve its attention that they should not be altogether\nuninstructed. The state, however, derives no inconsiderable advantage from\ntheir instruction. The more they are instructed, the less liable they are\nto the delusions of enthusiasm and superstition, which, among ignorant\nnations frequently occasion the most dreadful disorders. An instructed and\nintelligent people, besides, are always more decent and orderly than an\nignorant and stupid one. They feel themselves, each individually, more\nrespectable, and more likely to obtain the respect of their lawful\nsuperiors, and they are, therefore, more disposed to respect those\nsuperiors. They are more disposed to examine, and more capable of seeing\nthrough, the interested complaints of faction and sedition; and they are,\nupon that account, less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary\nopposition to the measures of government. In free countries, where the\nsafety of government depends very much upon the favourable judgment which\nthe people may form of its conduct, it must surely be of the highest\nimportance, that they should not be disposed to judge rashly or\ncapriciously concerning it.\nArt. III.\u2014Of the Expense of the Institutions for the Instruction of\nPeople of all Ages.\nThe institutions for the instruction of people of all ages, are chiefly\nthose for religious instruction. This is a species of instruction, of\nwhich the object is not so much to render the people good citizens in this\nworld, as to prepare them for another and a better world in the life to\ncome. The teachers of the doctrine which contains this instruction, in the\nsame manner as other teachers, may either depend altogether for their\nsubsistence upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers; or they may\nderive it from some other fund, to which the law of their country may\nentitle them; such as a landed estate, a tythe or land tax, an established\nsalary or stipend. Their exertion, their zeal and industry, are likely to\nbe much greater in the former situation than in the latter. In this\nrespect, the teachers of a new religion have always had a considerable\nadvantage in attacking those ancient and established systems, of which the\nclergy, reposing themselves upon their benefices, had neglected to keep up\nthe fervour of faith and devotion in the great body of the people; and\nhaving given themselves up to indolence, were become altogether incapable\nof making any vigorous exertion in defence even of their own\nestablishment. The clergy of an established and well endowed religion\nfrequently become men of learning and elegance, who possess all the\nvirtues of gentlemen, or which can recommend them to the esteem of\ngentlemen; but they are apt gradually to lose the qualities, both good and\nbad, which gave them authority and influence with the inferior ranks of\npeople, and which had perhaps been the original causes of the success and\nestablishment of their religion. Such a clergy, when attacked by a set of\npopular and bold, though perhaps stupid and ignorant enthusiasts, feel\nthemselves as perfectly defenceless as the indolent, effeminate, and full\nfed nations of the southern parts of Asia, when they were invaded by the\nactive, hardy, and hungry Tartars of the north. Such a clergy, upon such\nan emergency, have commonly no other resource than to call upon the civil\nmagistrate to persecute, destroy, or drive out their adversaries, as\ndisturbers of the public peace. It was thus that the Roman catholic clergy\ncalled upon the civil magistrate to persecute the protestants, and the\nchurch of England to persecute the dissenters; and that in general every\nreligious sect, when it has once enjoyed, for a century or two, the\nsecurity of a legal establishment, has found itself incapable of making\nany vigorous defence against any new sect which chose to attack its\ndoctrine or discipline. Upon such occasions, the advantage, in point of\nlearning and good writing, may sometimes be on the side of the established\nchurch. But the arts of popularity, all the arts of gaining proselytes,\nare constantly on the side of its adversaries. In England, those arts have\nbeen long neglected by the well endowed clergy of the established church,\nand are at present chiefly cultivated by the dissenters and by the\nmethodists. The independent provisions, however, which in many places have\nbeen made for dissenting teachers, by means of voluntary subscriptions, of\ntrust rights, and other evasions of the law, seem very much to have abated\nthe zeal and activity of those teachers. They have many of them become\nvery learned, ingenious, and respectable men; but they have in general\nceased to be very popular preachers. The methodists, without half the\nlearning of the dissenters, are much more in vogue.\nIn the church of Rome the industry and zeal of the inferior clergy are\nkept more alive by the powerful motive of self-interest, than perhaps in\nany established protestant church. The parochial clergy derive many of\nthem, a very considerable part of their subsistence from the voluntary\noblations of the people; a source of revenue, which confession gives them\nmany opportunities of improving. The mendicant orders derive their whole\nsubsistence from such oblations. It is with them as with the hussars and\nlight infantry of some armies; no plunder, no pay. The parochial clergy\nare like those teachers whose reward depends partly upon their salary, and\npartly upon the fees or honoraries which they get from their pupils; and\nthese must always depend, more or less, upon their industry and\nreputation. The mendicant orders are like those teachers whose subsistence\ndepends altogether upon their industry. They are obliged, therefore, to\nuse every art which can animate the devotion of the common people. The\nestablishment of the two great mendicant orders of St Dominic and St.\nFrancis, it is observed by Machiavel, revived, in the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries, the languishing faith and devotion of the catholic\nchurch. In Roman catholic countries, the spirit of devotion is supported\naltogether by the monks, and by the poorer parochial clergy. The great\ndignitaries of the church, with all the accomplishments of gentlemen and\nmen of the world, and sometimes with those of men of learning, are careful\nto maintain the necessary discipline over their inferiors, but seldom give\nthemselves any trouble about the instruction of the people.\n\u201cMost of the arts and professions in a state,\u201d says by far the most\nillustrious philosopher and historian of the present age, \u201care of such a\nnature, that, while they promote the interests of the society, they are\nalso useful or agreeable to some individuals; and, in that case, the\nconstant rule of the magistrate, except, perhaps, on the first\nintroduction of any art, is, to leave the profession to itself, and trust\nits encouragement to the individuals who reap the benefit of it. The\nartizans, finding their profits to rise by the favour of their customers,\nincrease, as much as possible, their skill and industry; and as matters\nare not disturbed by any injudicious tampering, the commodity is always\nsure to be at all times nearly proportioned to the demand.\n\u201cBut there are also some callings which, though useful and even necessary\nin a state, bring no advantage or pleasure to any individual; and the\nsupreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the retainers\nof those professions. It must give them public encouragement in order to\ntheir subsistence; and it must provide against that negligence to which\nthey will naturally be subject, either by annexing particular honours to\nprofession, by establishing a long subordination of ranks, and a strict\ndependence, or by some other expedient. The persons employed in the\nfinances, fleets, and magistracy, are instances of this order of men.\n\u201cIt may naturally be thought, at first sight, that the ecclesiastics\nbelong to the first class, and that their encouragement, as well as that\nof lawyers and physicians, may safely be entrusted to the liberality of\nindividuals, who are attached to their doctrines, and who find benefit or\nconsolation from their spiritual ministry and assistance. Their industry\nand vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted by such an additional motive; and\ntheir skill in the profession, as well as their address in governing the\nminds of the people, must receive daily increase, from their increasing\npractice, study, and attention.\n\u201cBut if we consider the matter more closely, we shall find that this\ninterested diligence of the clergy is what every wise legislator will\nstudy to prevent; because, in every religion except the true, it is highly\npernicious, and it has even a natural tendency to pervert the truth, by\ninfusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly, and delusion.\nEach ghostly practitioner, in order to render himself more precious and\nsacred in the eyes of his retainers, will inspire them with the most\nviolent abhorrence of all other sects, and continually endeavour, by some\nnovelty, to excite the languid devotion of his audience. No regard will be\npaid to truth, morals, or decency, in the doctrines inculcated. Every\ntenet will be adopted that best suits the disorderly affections of the\nhuman frame. Customers will be drawn to each conventicle by new industry\nand address, in practising on the passions and credulity of the populace.\nAnd, in the end, the civil magistrate will find that he has dearly paid\nfor his intended frugality, in saving a fixed establishment for the\npriests; and that, in reality, the most decent and advantageous\ncomposition, which he can make with the spiritual guides, is to bribe\ntheir indolence, by assigning stated salaries to their profession, and\nrendering it superfluous for them to be farther active, than merely to\nprevent their flock from straying in quest of new pastors. And in this\nmanner ecclesiastical establishments, though commonly they arose at first\nfrom religious views, prove in the end advantageous to the political\ninterests of society.\u201d\nBut whatever may have been the good or bad effects of the independent\nprovision of the clergy, it has, perhaps, been very seldom bestowed upon\nthem from any view to those effects. Times of violent religious\ncontroversy have generally been times of equally violent political\nfaction. Upon such occasions, each political party has either found it, or\nimagined it, for his interest, to league itself with some one or other of\nthe contending religious sects. But this could be done only by adopting,\nor, at least, by favouring the tenets of that particular sect. The sect\nwhich had the good fortune to be leagued with the conquering party\nnecessarily shared in the victory of its ally, by whose favour and\nprotection it was soon enabled, in some degree, to silence and subdue all\nits adversaries. Those adversaries had generally leagued themselves with\nthe enemies of the conquering party, and were, therefore the enemies of\nthat party. The clergy of this particular sect having thus become complete\nmasters of the field, and their influence and authority with the great\nbody of the people being in its highest vigour, they were powerful enough\nto overawe the chiefs and leaders of their own party, and to oblige the\ncivil magistrate to respect their opinions and inclinations. Their first\ndemand was generally that he should silence and subdue all their\nadversaries; and their second, that he should bestow an independent\nprovision on themselves. As they had generally contributed a good deal to\nthe victory, it seemed not unreasonable that they should have some share\nin the spoil. They were weary, besides, of humouring the people, and of\ndepending upon their caprice for a subsistence. In making this demand,\ntherefore, they consulted their own ease and comfort, without troubling\nthemselves about the effect which it might have, in future times, upon the\ninfluence and authority of their order. The civil magistrate, who could\ncomply with their demand only by giving them something which he would have\nchosen much rather to take, or to keep to himself, was seldom very forward\nto grant it. Necessity, however, always forced him to submit at last,\nthough frequently not till after many delays, evasions, and affected\nexcuses.\nBut if politics had never called in the aid of religion, had the\nconquering party never adopted the tenets of one sect more than those of\nanother, when it had gained the victory, it would probably have dealt\nequally and impartially with all the different sects, and have allowed\nevery man to choose his own priest, and his own religion, as he thought\nproper. There would, and, in this case, no doubt, have been, a great\nmultitude of religious sects. Almost every different congregation might\nprobably have had a little sect by itself, or have entertained some\npeculiar tenets of its own. Each teacher, would, no doubt, have felt\nhimself under the necessity of making the utmost exertion, and of using\nevery art, both to preserve and to increase the number of his disciples.\nBut as every other teacher would have felt himself under the same\nnecessity, the success of no one teacher, or sect of teachers, could have\nbeen very great. The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can\nbe dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect\ntolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided\ninto two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and\nunder a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be\naltogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three\nhundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one\ncould be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The\nteachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more\nadversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and\nmoderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those\ngreat sects, whose tenets, being supported by the civil magistrate, are\nheld in veneration by almost all the inhabitants of extensive kingdoms and\nempires, and who, therefore, see nothing round them but followers,\ndisciples, and humble admirers. The teachers of each little sect, finding\nthemselves almost alone, would be obliged to respect those of almost every\nother sect; and the concessions which they would mutually find it both\nconvenient and agreeable to make one to another, might in time, probably\nreduce the doctrine of the greater part of them to that pure and rational\nreligion, free from every mixture of absurdity, imposture, or fanaticism,\nsuch as wise men have, in all ages of the world, wished to see\nestablished; but such as positive law has, perhaps, never yet established,\nand probably never will establish in any country; because, with regard to\nreligion, positive law always has been, and probably always will be, more\nor less influenced by popular superstition and enthusiasm. This plan of\necclesiastical government, or, more properly, of no ecclesiastical\ngovernment, was what the sect called Independents (a sect, no doubt, of\nvery wild enthusiasts), proposed to establish in England towards the end\nof the civil war. If it had been established, though of a very\nunphilosophical origin, it would probably, by this time, have been\nproductive of the most philosophical good temper and moderation with\nregard to every sort of religious principle. It has been established in\nPennsylvania, where, though the quakers happen to be the most numerous,\nthe law, in reality, favours no one sect more than another; and it is\nthere said to have been productive of this philosophical good temper and\nmoderation.\nBut though this equality of treatment should not be productive of this\ngood temper and moderation in all, or even in the greater part of the\nreligious sects of a particular country; yet, provided those sects were\nsufficiently numerous, and each of them consequently too small to disturb\nthe public tranquillity, the excessive zeal of each for its particular\ntenets could not well be productive of any very hurtful effects, but, on\nthe contrary, of several good ones; and if the government was perfectly\ndecided, both to let them all alone, and to oblige them all to let alone\none another, there is little danger that they would not of their own\naccord, subdivide themselves fast enough, so as soon to become\nsufficiently numerous.\nIn every civilized society, in every society where the distinction of\nranks has once been completely established, there have been always two\ndifferent schemes or systems of morality current at the same time; of\nwhich the one may be called the strict or austere; the other the liberal,\nor, if you will, the loose system. The former is generally admired and\nrevered by the common people; the latter is commonly more esteemed and\nadopted by what are called the people of fashion. The degree of\ndisapprobation with which we ought to mark the vices of levity, the vices\nwhich are apt to arise from great prosperity, and from the excess of\ngaiety and good humour, seems to constitute the principal distinction\nbetween those two opposite schemes or systems. In the liberal or loose\nsystem, luxury, wanton, and even disorderly mirth, the pursuit of pleasure\nto some degree of intemperance, the breach of chastity, at least in one of\nthe two sexes, etc. provided they are not accompanied with gross\nindecency, and do not lead to falsehood and injustice, are generally\ntreated with a good deal of indulgence, and are easily either excused or\npardoned altogether. In the austere system, on the contrary, those\nexcesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and detestation. The\nvices of levity are always ruinous to the common people, and a single\nweek\u2019s thoughtlessness and dissipation is often sufficient to undo a poor\nworkman for ever, and to drive him, through despair, upon committing the\nmost enormous crimes. The wiser and better sort of the common people,\ntherefore, have always the utmost abhorrence and detestation of such\nexcesses, which their experience tells them are so immediately fatal to\npeople of their condition. The disorder and extravagance of several years,\non the contrary, will not always ruin a man of fashion; and people of that\nrank are very apt to consider the power of indulging in some degree of\nexcess, as one of the advantages of their fortune; and the liberty of\ndoing so without censure or reproach, as one of the privileges which\nbelong to their station. In people of their own station, therefore, they\nregard such excesses with but a small degree of disapprobation, and\ncensure them either very slightly or not at all.\nAlmost all religious sects have begun among the common people, from whom\nthey have generally drawn their earliest, as well as their most numerous\nproselytes. The austere system of morality has, accordingly, been adopted\nby those sects almost constantly, or with very few exceptions; for there\nhave been some. It was the system by which they could best recommend\nthemselves to that order of people, to whom they first proposed their plan\nof reformation upon what had been before established. Many of them,\nperhaps the greater part of them, have even endeavoured to gain credit by\nrefining upon this austere system, and by carrying it to some degree of\nfolly and extravagance; and this excessive rigour has frequently\nrecommended them, more than any thing else, to the respect and veneration\nof the common people.\nA man of rank and fortune is, by his station, the distinguished member of\na great society, who attend to every part of his conduct, and who thereby\noblige him to attend to every part of it himself. His authority and\nconsideration depend very much upon the respect which this society bears\nto him. He dares not do anything which would disgrace or discredit him in\nit; and he is obliged to a very strict observation of that species of\nmorals, whether liberal or austere, which the general consent of this\nsociety prescribes to persons of his rank and fortune. A man of low\ncondition, on the contrary, is far from being a distinguished member of\nany great society. While he remains in a country village, his conduct may\nbe attended to, and he may be obliged to attend to it himself. In this\nsituation, and in this situation only, he may have what is called a\ncharacter to lose. But as soon as he comes into a great city, he is sunk\nin obscurity and darkness. His conduct is observed and attended to by\nnobody; and he is, therefore, very likely to neglect it himself, and to\nabandon himself to every sort of low profligacy and vice. He never emerges\nso effectually from this obscurity, his conduct never excites so much the\nattention of any respectable society, as by his becoming the member of a\nsmall religious sect. He from that moment acquires a degree of\nconsideration which he never had before. All his brother sectaries are,\nfor the credit of the sect, interested to observe his conduct; and, if he\ngives occasion to any scandal, if he deviates very much from those austere\nmorals which they almost always require of one another, to punish him by\nwhat is always a very severe punishment, even where no evil effects attend\nit, expulsion or excommunication from the sect. In little religious sects,\naccordingly, the morals of the common people have been almost always\nremarkably regular and orderly; generally much more so than in the\nestablished church. The morals of those little sects, indeed, have\nfrequently been rather disagreeably rigorous and unsocial.\nThere are two very easy and effectual remedies, however, by whose joint\noperation the state might, without violence, correct whatever was unsocial\nor disagreeably rigorous in the morals of all the little sects into which\nthe country was divided.\nThe first of those remedies is the study of science and philosophy, which\nthe state might render almost universal among all people of middling or\nmore than middling rank and fortune; not by giving salaries to teachers in\norder to make them negligent and idle, but by instituting some sort of\nprobation, even in the higher and more difficult sciences, to be undergone\nby every person before he was permitted to exercise any liberal\nprofession, or before he could be received as a candidate for any\nhonourable office, of trust or profit. If the state imposed upon this\norder of men the necessity of learning, it would have no occasion to give\nitself any trouble about providing them with proper teachers. They would\nsoon find better teachers for themselves, than any whom the state could\nprovide for them. Science is the great antidote to the poison of\nenthusiasm and superstition; and where all the superior ranks of people\nwere secured from it, the inferior ranks could not be much exposed to it.\nThe second of those remedies is the frequency and gaiety of public\ndiversions. The state, by encouraging, that is, by giving entire liberty\nto all those who, from their own interest, would attempt, without scandal\nor indecency, to amuse and divert the people by painting, poetry, music,\ndancing; by all sorts of dramatic representations and exhibitions; would\neasily dissipate, in the greater part of them, that melancholy and gloomy\nhumour which is almost always the nurse of popular superstition and\nenthusiasm. Public diversions have always been the objects of dread and\nhatred to all the fanatical promoters of those popular frenzies. The\ngaiety and good humour which those diversions inspire, were altogether\ninconsistent with that temper of mind which was fittest for their purpose,\nor which they could best work upon. Dramatic representations, besides,\nfrequently exposing their artifices to public ridicule, and sometimes even\nto public execration, were, upon that account, more than all other\ndiversions, the objects of their peculiar abhorrence.\nIn a country where the law favoured the teachers of no one religion more\nthan those of another, it would not be necessary that any of them should\nhave any particular or immediate dependency upon the sovereign or\nexecutive power; or that he should have anything to do either in\nappointing or in dismissing them from their offices. In such a situation,\nhe would have no occasion to give himself any concern about them, further\nthan to keep the peace among them, in the same manner as among the rest of\nhis subjects, that is, to hinder them from persecuting, abusing, or\noppressing one another. But it is quite otherwise in countries where there\nis an established or governing religion. The sovereign can in this case\nnever be secure, unless he has the means of influencing in a considerable\ndegree the greater part of the teachers of that religion.\nThe clergy of every established church constitute a great incorporation.\nThey can act in concert, and pursue their interest upon one plan, and with\none spirit as much as if they were under the direction of one man; and\nthey are frequently, too, under such direction. Their interest as an\nincorporated body is never the same with that of the sovereign, and is\nsometimes directly opposite to it. Their great interest is to maintain\ntheir authority with the people, and this authority depends upon the\nsupposed certainty and importance of the whole doctrine which they\ninculcate, and upon the supposed necessity of adopting every part of it\nwith the most implicit faith, in order to avoid eternal misery. Should the\nsovereign have the imprudence to appear either to deride, or doubt himself\nof the most trifling part of their doctrine, or from humanity, attempt to\nprotect those who did either the one or the other, the punctilious honour\nof a clergy, who have no sort of dependency upon him, is immediately\nprovoked to proscribe him as a profane person, and to employ all the\nterrors of religion, in order to oblige the people to transfer their\nallegiance to some more orthodox and obedient prince. Should he oppose any\nof their pretensions or usurpations, the danger is equally great. The\nprinces who have dared in this manner to rebel against the church, over\nand above this crime of rebellion, have generally been charged, too, with\nthe additional crime of heresy, notwithstanding their solemn protestations\nof their faith, and humble submission to every tenet which she thought\nproper to prescribe to them. But the authority of religion is superior to\nevery other authority. The fears which it suggests conquer all other\nfears. When the authorized teachers of religion propagate through the\ngreat body of the people, doctrines subversive of the authority of the\nsovereign, it is by violence only, or by the force of a standing army,\nthat he can maintain his authority. Even a standing army cannot in this\ncase give him any lasting security; because if the soldiers are not\nforeigners, which can seldom be the case, but drawn from the great body of\nthe people, which must almost always be the case, they are likely to be\nsoon corrupted by those very doctrines. The revolutions which the\nturbulence of the Greek clergy was continually occasioning at\nConstantinople, as long as the eastern empire subsisted; the convulsions\nwhich, during the course of several centuries, the turbulence of the Roman\nclergy was continually occasioning in every part of Europe, sufficiently\ndemonstrate how precarious and insecure must always be the situation of\nthe sovereign, who has no proper means of influencing the clergy of the\nestablished and governing religion of his country.\nArticles of faith, as well as all other spiritual matters, it is evident\nenough, are not within the proper department of a temporal sovereign, who,\nthough he may be very well qualified for protecting, is seldom supposed to\nbe so for instructing the people. With regard to such matters, therefore,\nhis authority can seldom be sufficient to counterbalance the united\nauthority of the clergy of the established church. The public\ntranquillity, however, and his own security, may frequently depend upon\nthe doctrines which they may think proper to propagate concerning such\nmatters. As he can seldom directly oppose their decision, therefore, with\nproper weight and authority, it is necessary that he should be able to\ninfluence it; and he can influence it only by the fears and expectations\nwhich he may excite in the greater part of the individuals of the order.\nThose fears and expectations may consist in the fear of deprivation or\nother punishment, and in the expectation of further preferment.\nIn all Christian churches, the benefices of the clergy are a sort of\nfreeholds, which they enjoy, not during pleasure, but during life or good\nbehaviour. If they held them by a more precarious tenure, and were liable\nto be turned out upon every slight disobligation either of the sovereign\nor of his ministers, it would perhaps be impossible for them to maintain\ntheir authority with the people, who would then consider them as mercenary\ndependents upon the court, in the sincerity of whose instructions they\ncould no longer have any confidence. But should the sovereign attempt\nirregularly, and by violence, to deprive any number of clergymen of their\nfreeholds, on account, perhaps, of their having propagated, with more than\nordinary zeal, some factious or seditious doctrine, he would only render,\nby such persecution, both them and their doctrine ten times more popular,\nand therefore ten times more troublesome and dangerous, than they had been\nbefore. Fear is in almost all cases a wretched instrument of govermnent,\nand ought in particular never to be employed against any order of men who\nhave the smallest pretensions to independency. To attempt to terrify them,\nserves only to irritate their bad humour, and to confirm them in an\nopposition, which more gentle usage, perhaps, might easily induce them\neither to soften, or to lay aside altogether. The violence which the\nFrench government usually employed in order to oblige all their\nparliaments, or sovereign courts of justice, to enregister any unpopular\nedict, very seldom succeeded. The means commonly employed, however, the\nimprisonment of all the refractory members, one would think, were forcible\nenough. The princes of the house of Stuart sometimes employed the like\nmeans in order to influence some of the members of the parliament of\nEngland, and they generally found them equally intractable. The parliament\nof England is now managed in another manner; and a very small experiment,\nwhich the duke of Choiseul made, about twelve years ago, upon the\nparliament of Paris, demonstrated sufficiently that all the parliaments of\nFrance might have been managed still more easily in the same manner. That\nexperiment was not pursued. For though management and persuasion are\nalways the easiest and safest instruments of government as force and\nviolence are the worst and the most dangerous; yet such, it seems, is the\nnatural insolence of man, that he almost always disdains to use the good\ninstrument, except when he cannot or dare not use the bad one. The French\ngovernment could and durst use force, and therefore disdained to use\nmanagement and persuasion. But there is no order of men, it appears I\nbelieve, from the experience of all ages, upon whom it is so dangerous or\nrather so perfectly ruinous, to employ force and violence, as upon the\nrespected clergy of an established church. The rights, the privileges, the\npersonal liberty of every individual ecclesiastic, who is upon good terms\nwith his own order, are, even in the most despotic governments, more\nrespected than those of any other person of nearly equal rank and fortune.\nIt is so in every gradation of despotism, from that of the gentle and mild\ngovernment of Paris, to that of the violent and furious government of\nConstantinople. But though this order of men can scarce ever be forced,\nthey may be managed as easily as any other; and the security of the\nsovereign, as well as the public tranquillity, seems to depend very much\nupon the means which he has of managing them; and those means seem to\nconsist altogether in the preferment which he has to bestow upon them.\nIn the ancient constitution of the Christian church, the bishop of each\ndiocese was elected by the joint votes of the clergy and of the people of\nthe episcopal city. The people did not long retain their right of\nelection; and while they did retain it, they almost always acted under the\ninfluence of the clergy, who, in such spiritual matters, appeared to be\ntheir natural guides. The clergy, however, soon grew weary of the trouble\nof managing them, and found it easier to elect their own bishops\nthemselves. The abbot, in the same manner, was elected by the monks of the\nmonastery, at least in the greater part of abbacies. All the inferior\necclesiastical benefices comprehended within the diocese were collated by\nthe bishop, who bestowed them upon such ecclesiastics as he thought\nproper. All church preferments were in this manner in the disposal of the\nchurch. The sovereign, though he might have some indirect influence in\nthose elections, and though it was sometimes usual to ask both his consent\nto elect, and his approbation of the election, yet had no direct or\nsufficient means of managing the clergy. The ambition of every clergyman\nnaturally led him to pay court, not so much to his sovereign as to his own\norder, from which only he could expect preferment.\nThrough the greater part of Europe, the pope gradually drew to himself,\nfirst the collation of almost all bishoprics and abbacies, or of what were\ncalled consistorial benefices, and afterwards, by various machinations and\npretences, of the greater part of inferior benefices comprehended within\neach diocese, little more being left to the bishop than what was barely\nnecessary to give him a decent authority with his own clergy. By this\narrangement the condition of the sovereign was still worse than it had\nbeen before. The clergy of all the different countries of Europe were thus\nformed into a sort of spiritual army, dispersed in different quarters\nindeed, but of which all the movements and operations could now be\ndirected by one head, and conducted upon one uniform plan. The clergy of\neach particular country might be considered as a particular detachment of\nthat army, of which the operations could easily be supported and seconded\nby all the other detachments quartered in the different countries round\nabout. Each detachment was not only independent of the sovereign of the\ncountry in which it was quartered, and by which it was maintained, but\ndependent upon a foreign sovereign, who could at any time turn its arms\nagainst the sovereign of that particular country, and support them by the\narms of all the other detachments.\nThose arms were the most formidable that can well be imagined. In the\nancient state of Europe, before the establishment of arts and\nmanufactures, the wealth of the clergy gave them the same sort of\ninfluence over the common people which that of the great barons gave them\nover their respective vassals, tenants, and retainers. In the great landed\nestates, which the mistaken piety both of princes and private persons had\nbestowed upon the church, jurisdictions were established, of the same kind\nwith those of the great barons, and for the same reason. In those great\nlanded estates, the clergy, or their bailiffs, could easily keep the\npeace, without the support or assistance either of the king or of any\nother person; and neither the king nor any other person could keep the\npeace there without the support and assistance of the clergy. The\njurisdictions of the clergy, therefore, in their particular baronies or\nmanors, were equally independent, and equally exclusive of the authority\nof the king\u2019s courts, as those of the great temporal lords. The tenants of\nthe clergy were, like those of the great barons, almost all tenants at\nwill, entirely dependent upon their immediate lords, and, therefore,\nliable to be called out at pleasure, in order to fight in any quarrel in\nwhich the clergy might think proper to engage them. Over and above the\nrents of those estates, the clergy possessed in the tithes a very large\nportion of the rents of all the other estates in every kingdom of Europe.\nThe revenues arising from both those species of rents were, the greater\npart of them, paid in kind, in corn, wine, cattle, poultry, etc. The\nquantity exceeded greatly what the clergy could themselves consume; and\nthere were neither arts nor manufactures, for the produce of which they\ncould exchange the surplus. The clergy could derive advantage from this\nimmense surplus in no other way than by employing it, as the great barons\nemployed the like surplus of their revenues, in the most profuse\nhospitality, and in the most extensive charity. Both the hospitality and\nthe charity of the ancient clergy, accordingly, are said to have been very\ngreat. They not only maintained almost the whole poor of every kingdom,\nbut many knights and gentlemen had frequently no other means of\nsubsistence than by travelling about from monastery to monastery, under\npretence of devotion, but in reality to enjoy the hospitality of the\nclergy. The retainers of some particular prelates were often as numerous\nas those of the greatest lay-lords; and the retainers of all the clergy\ntaken together were, perhaps, more numerous than those of all the\nlay-lords. There was always much more union among the clergy than among\nthe lay-lords. The former were under a regular discipline and\nsubordination to the papal authority. The latter were under no regular\ndiscipline or subordination, but almost always equally jealous of one\nanother, and of the king. Though the tenants and retainers of the clergy,\ntherefore, had both together been less numerous than those of the great\nlay-lords, and their tenants were probably much less numerous, yet their\nunion would have rendered them more formidable. The hospitality and\ncharity of the clergy, too, not only gave them the command of a great\ntemporal force, but increased very much the weight of their spiritual\nweapons. Those virtues procured them the highest respect and veneration\namong all the inferior ranks of people, of whom many were constantly, and\nalmost all occasionally, fed by them. Everything belonging or related to\nso popular an order, its possessions, its privileges, its doctrines,\nnecessarily appeared sacred in the eyes of the common people; and every\nviolation of them, whether real or pretended, the highest act of\nsacrilegious wickedness and profaneness. In this state of things, if the\nsovereign frequently found it difficult to resist the confederacy of a few\nof the great nobility, we cannot wonder that he should find it still more\nso to resist the united force of the clergy of his own dominions,\nsupported by that of the clergy of all the neighbouring dominions. In such\ncircumstances, the wonder is, not that he was sometimes obliged to yield,\nbut that he ever was able to resist.\nThe privileges of the clergy in those ancient times (which to us, who live\nin the present times, appear the most absurd), their total exemption from\nthe secular jurisdiction, for example, or what in England was called the\nbenefit of clergy, were the natural, or rather the necessary, consequences\nof this state of things. How dangerous must it have been for the sovereign\nto attempt to punish a clergyman for any crime whatever, if his order were\ndisposed to protect him, and to represent either the proof as insufficient\nfor convicting so holy a man, or the punishment as too severe to be\ninflicted upon one whose person had been rendered sacred by religion? The\nsovereign could, in such circumstances, do no better than leave him to be\ntried by the ecclesiastical courts, who, for the honour of their own\norder, were interested to restrain, as much as possible, every member of\nit from committing enormous crimes, or even from giving occasion to such\ngross scandal as might disgust the minds of the people.\nIn the state in which things were, through the greater part of Europe,\nduring the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, and for\nsome time both before and after that period, the constitution of the\nchurch of Rome may be considered as the most formidable combination that\never was formed against the authority and security of civil government, as\nwell as against the liberty, reason, and happiness of mankind, which can\nflourish only where civil government is able to protect them. In that\nconstitution, the grossest delusions of superstition were supported in\nsuch a manner by the private interests of so great a number of people, as\nput them out of all danger from any assault of human reason; because,\nthough human reason might, perhaps, have been able to unveil, even to the\neyes of the common people, some of the delusions of superstition, it could\nnever have dissolved the ties of private interest. Had this constitution\nbeen attacked by no other enemies but the feeble efforts of human reason,\nit must have endured for ever. But that immense and well-built fabric,\nwhich all the wisdom and virtue of man could never have shaken, much less\nhave overturned, was, by the natural course of things, first weakened, and\nafterwards in part destroyed; and is now likely, in the course of a few\ncenturies more, perhaps, to crumble into ruins altogether.\nThe gradual improvements of arts, manufactures, and commerce, the\nsame causes which destroyed the power of the great barons, destroyed,\nin the same manner, through the greater part of Europe, the whole\ntemporal power of the clergy. In the produce of arts, manufactures, and\ncommerce, the clergy, like the great barons, found something for which\nthey could exchange their rude produce, and thereby discovered the\nmeans of spending their whole revenues upon their own persons, without\ngiving any considerable share of them to other people. Their charity\nbecame gradually less extensive, their hospitality less liberal, or\nless profuse. Their retainers became consequently less numerous, and,\nby degrees, dwindled away altogether. The clergy, too, like the great\nbarons, wished to get a better rent from their landed estates, in order\nto spend it, in the same manner, upon the gratification of their own\nprivate vanity and folly. But this increase of rent could be got only\nby granting leases to their tenants, who thereby became, in a great\nmeasure, independent of them. The ties of interest, which bound the\ninferior ranks of people to the clergy, were in this manner gradually\nbroken and dissolved. They were even broken and dissolved sooner than\nthose which bound the same ranks of people to the great barons; because\nthe benefices of the church being, the greater part of them, much smaller\nthan the estates of the great barons, the possessor of each benefice was\nmuch sooner able to spend the whole of its revenue upon his own person.\nDuring the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the\npower of the great barons was, through the greater part of Europe, in\nfull vigour. But the temporal power of the clergy, the absolute command\nwhich they had once had over the great body of the people was very much\ndecayed. The power of the church was, by that time, very nearly reduced,\nthrough the greater part of Europe, to what arose from their spiritual\nauthority; and even that spiritual authority was much weakened, when it\nceased to be supported by the charity and hospitality of the clergy. The\ninferior ranks of people no longer looked upon that order as they had\ndone before; as the comforters of their distress, and the relievers of\ntheir indigence. On the contrary, they were provoked and disgusted by the\nvanity, luxury, and expense of the richer clergy, who appeared to spend\nupon their own pleasures what had always before been regarded as the\npatrimony of the poor.\nIn this situation of things, the sovereigns in the different states of\nEurope endeavoured to recover the influence which they had once had in the\ndisposal of the great benefices of the church; by procuring to the deans\nand chapters of each diocese the restoration of their ancient right of\nelecting the bishop; and to the monks of each abbacy that of electing the\nabbot. The re-establishing this ancient order was the object of several\nstatutes enacted in England during the course of the fourteenth century,\nparticularly of what is called the statute of provisors; and of the\npragmatic sanction, established in France in the fifteenth century. In\norder to render the election valid, it was necessary that the sovereign\nshould both consent to it before hand, and afterwards approve of the\nperson elected; and though the election was still supposed to be free, he\nhad, however all the indirect means which his situation necessarily\nafforded him, of influencing the clergy in his own dominions. Other\nregulations, of a similar tendency, were established in other parts of\nEurope. But the power of the pope, in the collation of the great benefices\nof the church, seems, before the reformation, to have been nowhere so\neffectually and so universally restrained as in France and England. The\nconcordat afterwards, in the sixteenth century, gave to the kings of\nFrance the absolute right of presenting to all the great, or what are\ncalled the consistorial, benefices of the Gallican church.\nSince the establishment of the pragmatic sanction and of the concordat,\nthe clergy of France have in general shewn less respect to the decrees of\nthe papal court, than the clergy of any other catholic country. In all the\ndisputes which their sovereign has had with the pope, they have almost\nconstantly taken part with the former. This independency of the clergy of\nFrance upon the court of Rome seems to be principally founded upon the\npragmatic sanction and the concordat. In the earlier periods of the\nmonarchy, the clergy of France appear to have been as much devoted to the\npope as those of any other country. When Robert, the second prince of the\nCapetian race, was most unjustly excommunicated by the court of Rome, his\nown servants, it is said, threw the victuals which came from his table to\nthe dogs, and refused to taste any thing themselves which had been\npolluted by the contact of a person in his situation. They were taught to\ndo so, it may very safely be presumed, by the clergy of his own dominions.\nThe claim of collating to the great benefices of the church, a claim in\ndefence of which the court of Rome had frequently shaken, and sometimes\noverturned, the thrones of some of the greatest sovereigns in Christendom,\nwas in this manner either restrained or modified, or given up altogether,\nin many different parts of Europe, even before the time of the\nreformation. As the clergy had now less influence over the people, so the\nstate had more influence over the clergy. The clergy, therefore, had both\nless power, and less inclination, to disturb the state.\nThe authority of the church of Rome was in this state of declension, when\nthe disputes which gave birth to the reformation began in Germany, and\nsoon spread themselves through every part of Europe. The new doctrines\nwere everywhere received with a high degree of popular favour. They were\npropagated with all that enthusiastic zeal which commonly animates the\nspirit of party, when it attacks established authority. The teachers of\nthose doctrines, though perhaps, in other respects, not more learned than\nmany of the divines who defended the established church, seem in general\nto have been better acquainted with ecclesiastical history, and with the\norigin and progress of that system of opinions upon which the authority of\nthe church was established; and they had thereby the advantage in almost\nevery dispute. The austerity of their manners gave them authority with the\ncommon people, who contrasted the strict regularity of their conduct with\nthe disorderly lives of the greater part of their own clergy. They\npossessed, too, in a much higher degree than their adversaries, all the\narts of popularity and of gaining proselytes; arts which the lofty and\ndignified sons of the church had long neglected, as being to them in a\ngreat measure useless. The reason of the new doctrines recommended them to\nsome, their novelty to many; the hatred and contempt of the established\nclergy to a still greater number: but the zealous, passionate, and\nfanatical, though frequently coarse and rustic eloquence, with which they\nwere almost everywhere inculcated, recommended them to by far the greatest\nnumber.\nThe success of the new doctrines was almost everywhere so great, that the\nprinces, who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court of\nRome, were, by means of them, easily enabled, in their own dominions, to\noverturn the church, which having lost the respect and veneration of the\ninferior ranks of people, could make scarce any resistance. The court of\nRome had disobliged some of the smaller princes in the northern parts of\nGermany, whom it had probably considered as too insignificant to be worth\nthe managing. They universally, therefore, established the reformation in\ntheir own dominions. The tyranny of Christiern II., and of Troll\narchbishop of Upsal, enabled Gustavus Vasa to expel them both from Sweden.\nThe pope favoured the tyrant and the archbishop, and Gustavus Vasa found\nno difficulty in establishing the reformation in Sweden. Christiern II.\nwas afterwards deposed from the throne of Denmark, where his conduct had\nrendered him as odious as in Sweden. The pope, however, was still disposed\nto favour him; and Frederic of Holstein, who had mounted the throne in his\nstead, revenged himself, by following the example of Gustavus Vasa. The\nmagistrates of Berne and Zurich, who had no particular quarrel with the\npope, established with great ease the reformation in their respective\ncantons, where just before some of the clergy had, by an imposture\nsomewhat grosser than ordinary, rendered the whole order both odious and\ncontemptible.\nIn this critical situation of its affairs the papal court was at\nsufficient pains to cultivate the friendship of the powerful sovereigns of\nFrance and Spain, of whom the latter was at that time emperor of Germany.\nWith their assistance, it was enabled, though not without great\ndifficulty, and much bloodshed, either to suppress altogether, or to\nobstruct very much, the progress of the reformation in their dominions. It\nwas well enough inclined, too, to be complaisant to the king of England.\nBut from the circumstances of the times, it could not be so without giving\noffence to a still greater sovereign, Charles V., king of Spain and\nemperor of Germany. Henry VIII., accordingly, though he did not embrace\nhimself the greater part of the doctrines of the reformation, was yet\nenabled, by their general prevalence, to suppress all the monasteries, and\nto abolish the authority of the church of Rome in his dominions. That he\nshould go so far, though he went no further, gave some satisfaction to the\npatrons of the reformation, who, having got possession of the government\nin the reign of his son and successor completed, without any difficulty,\nthe work which Henry VIII. had begun.\nIn some countries, as in Scotland, where the government was weak,\nunpopular, and not very firmly established, the reformation was strong\nenough to overturn, not only the church, but the state likewise, for\nattempting to support the church.\nAmong the followers of the reformation, dispersed in all the different\ncountries of Europe, there was no general tribunal, which, like that of\nthe court of Rome, or an oecumenical council, could settle all disputes\namong them, and, with irresistible authority, prescribe to all of them the\nprecise limits of orthodoxy. When the followers of the reformation in one\ncountry, therefore, happened to differ from their brethren in another, as\nthey had no common judge to appeal to, the dispute could never be decided;\nand many such disputes arose among them. Those concerning the government\nof the church, and the right of conferring ecclesiastical benefices, were\nperhaps the most interesting to the peace and welfare of civil society.\nThey gave birth, accordingly, to the two principal parties or sects among\nthe followers of the reformation, the Lutheran and Calvinistic sects, the\nonly sects among them, of which the doctrine and discipline have ever yet\nbeen established by law in any part of Europe.\nThe followers of Luther, together with what is called the church of\nEngland, preserved more or less of the episcopal government, established\nsubordination among the clergy, gave the sovereign the disposal of all the\nbishoprics, and other consistorial benefices within his dominions, and\nthereby rendered him the real head of the church; and without depriving\nthe bishop of the right of collating to the smaller benefices within his\ndiocese, they, even to those benefices, not only admitted, but favoured\nthe right of presentation, both in the sovereign and in all other lay\npatrons. This system of church government was, from the beginning,\nfavourable to peace and good order, and to submission to the civil\nsovereign. It has never, accordingly, been the occasion of any tumult or\ncivil commotion in any country in which it has once been established. The\nchurch of England, in particular, has always valued herself, with great\nreason, upon the unexceptionable loyalty of her principles. Under such a\ngovernment, the clergy naturally endeavour to recommend themselves to the\nsovereign, to the court, and to the nobility and gentry of the country, by\nwhose influence they chiefly expect to obtain preferment. They pay court\nto those patrons, sometimes, no doubt, by the vilest flattery and\nassentation; but frequently, too, by cultivating all those arts which best\ndeserve, and which are therefore most likely to gain them, the esteem of\npeople of rank and fortune; by their knowledge in all the different\nbranches of useful and ornamental learning, by the decent liberality of\ntheir manners, by the social good humour of their conversation, and by\ntheir avowed contempt of those absurd and hypocritical austerities which\nfanatics inculcate and pretend to practise, in order to draw upon\nthemselves the veneration, and upon the greater part of men of rank and\nfortune, who avow that they do not practise them, the abhorrence of the\ncommon people. Such a clergy, however, while they pay their court in this\nmanner to the higher ranks of life, are very apt to neglect altogether the\nmeans of maintaining their influence and authority with the lower. They\nare listened to, esteemed, and respected by their superiors; but before\ntheir inferiors they are frequently incapable of defending, effectually,\nand to the conviction of such hearers, their own sober and moderate\ndoctrines, against the most ignorant enthusiast who chooses to attack\nthem.\nThe followers of Zuinglius, or more properly those of Calvin, on the\ncontrary, bestowed upon the people of each parish, whenever the church\nbecame vacant, the right of electing their own pastor; and established, at\nthe same time, the most perfect equality among the clergy. The former part\nof this institution, as long as it remained in vigour, seems to have been\nproductive of nothing but disorder and confusion, and to have tended\nequally to corrupt the morals both of the clergy and of the people. The\nlatter part seems never to have had any effects but what were perfectly\nagreeable.\nAs long as the people of each parish preserved the right of electing their\nown pastors, they acted almost always under the influence of the clergy,\nand generally of the most factious and fanatical of the order. The clergy,\nin order to preserve their influence in those popular elections, became,\nor affected to become, many of them, fanatics themselves, encouraged\nfanaticism among the people, and gave the preference almost always to the\nmost fanatical candidate. So small a matter as the appointment of a parish\npriest, occasioned almost always a violent contest, not only in one\nparish, but in all the neighbouring parishes who seldom failed to take\npart in the quarrel. When the parish happened to be situated in a great\ncity, it divided all the inhabitants into two parties; and when that city\nhappened, either to constitute itself a little republic, or to be the head\nand capital of a little republic, as in the case with many of the\nconsiderable cities in Switzerland and Holland, every paltry dispute of\nthis kind, over and above exasperating the animosity of all their other\nfactions, threatened to leave behind it, both a new schism in the church,\nand a new faction in the state. In those small republics, therefore, the\nmagistrate very soon found it necessary, for the sake of preserving the\npublic peace, to assume to himself the right of presenting to all vacant\nbenefices. In Scotland, the most extensive country in which this\npresbyterian form of church government has ever been established, the\nrights of patronage were in effect abolished by the act which established\npresbytery in the beginning of the reign of William III. That act, at\nleast, put in the power of certain classes of people in each parish to\npurchase, for a very small price, the right of electing their own pastor.\nThe constitution which this act established, was allowed to subsist for\nabout two-and-twenty years, but was abolished by the 10th of queen Anne,\nch.12, on account of the confusions and disorders which this more popular\nmode of election had almost everywhere occasioned. In so extensive a\ncountry as Scotland, however, a tumult in a remote parish was not so\nlikely to give disturbance to government as in a smaller state. The 10th\nof queen Anne restored the rights of patronage. But though, in Scotland,\nthe law gives the benefice, without any exception to the person presented\nby the patron; yet the church requires sometimes (for she has not in this\nrespect been very uniform in her decisions) a certain concurrence of the\npeople, before she will confer upon the presentee what is called the cure\nof souls, or the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the parish. She sometimes,\nat least, from an affected concern for the peace of the parish, delays the\nsettlement till this concurrence can be procured. The private tampering of\nsome of the neighbouring clergy, sometimes to procure, but more frequently\nto prevent this concurrence, and the popular arts which they cultivate, in\norder to enable them upon such occasions to tamper more effectually, are\nperhaps the causes which principally keep up whatever remains of the old\nfanatical spirit, either in the clergy or in the people of Scotland.\nThe equality which the presbyterian form of church government establishes\namong the clergy, consists, first, in the equality of authority or\necclesiastical jurisdiction; and, secondly, in the equality of benefice.\nIn all presbyterian churches, the equality of authority is perfect; that\nof benefice is not so. The difference, however, between one benefice and\nanother, is seldom so considerable, as commonly to tempt the possessor\neven of the small one to pay court to his patron, by the vile arts of\nflattery and assentation, in order to get a better. In all the\npresbyterian churches, where the rights of patronage are thoroughly\nestablished, it is by nobler and better arts, that the established clergy\nin general endeavour to gain the favour of their superiors; by their\nlearning, by the irreproachable regularity of their life, and by the\nfaithful and diligent discharge of their duty. Their patrons even\nfrequently complain of the independency of their spirit, which they are\napt to construe into ingratitude for past favours, but which, at worse,\nperhaps, is seldom anymore than that indifference which naturally arises\nfrom the consciousness that no further favours of the kind are ever to be\nexpected. There is scarce, perhaps, to be found anywhere in Europe, a more\nlearned, decent, independent, and respectable set of men, than the greater\npart of the presbyterian clergy of Holland, Geneva, Switzerland, and\nScotland.\nWhere the church benefices are all nearly equal, none of them can be very\ngreat; and this mediocrity of benefice, though it may be, no doubt,\ncarried too far, has, however, some very agreeable effects. Nothing but\nexemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune. The vices of\nlevity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous, and are, besides,\nalmost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people. In his own\nconduct, therefore, he is obliged to follow that system of morals which\nthe common people respect the most. He gains their esteem and affection,\nby that plan of life which his own interest and situation would lead him\nto follow. The common people look upon him with that kindness with which\nwe naturally regard one who approaches somewhat to our own condition, but\nwho, we think, ought to be in a higher. Their kindness naturally provokes\nhis kindness. He becomes careful to instruct them, and attentive to assist\nand relieve them. He does not even despise the prejudices of people who\nare disposed to be so favourable to him, and never treats them with those\ncontemptuous and arrogant airs, which we so often meet with in the proud\ndignitaries of opulent and well endowed churches. The presbyterian clergy,\naccordingly, have more influence over the minds of the common people, than\nperhaps the clergy of any other established church. It is, accordingly, in\npresbyterian countries only, that we ever find the common people\nconverted, without persecution completely, and almost to a man, to the\nestablished church.\nIn countries where church benefices are, the greater part of them, very\nmoderate, a chair in a university is generally a better establishment than\na church benefice. The universities have, in this case, the picking and\nchusing of their members from all the churchmen of the country, who, in\nevery country, constitute by far the most numerous class of men of\nletters. Where church benefices, on the contrary, are many of them very\nconsiderable, the church naturally draws from the universities the greater\npart of their eminent men of letters; who generally find some patron, who\ndoes himself honour by procuring them church preferment. In the former\nsituation, we are likely to find the universities filled with the most\neminent men of letters that are to be found in the country. In the latter,\nwe are likely to find few eminent men among them, and those few among the\nyoungest members of the society, who are likely, too, to be drained away\nfrom it, before they can have acquired experience and knowledge enough to\nbe of much use to it. It is observed by Mr de Voltaire, that father\nPor\u00e9e, a jesuit of no great eminence in the republic of letters, was the\nonly professor they had ever had in France, whose works were worth the\nreading. In a country which has produced so many eminent men of letters,\nit must appear somewhat singular, that scarce one of them should have been\na professor in a university. The famous Cassendi was, in the beginning of\nhis life, a professor in the university of Aix. Upon the first dawning of\nhis genius, it was represented to him, that by going into the church he\ncould easily find a much more quiet and comfortable subsistence, as well\nas a better situation for pursuing his studies; and he immediately\nfollowed the advice. The observation of Mr de Voltaire may be applied, I\nbelieve, not only to France, but to all other Roman Catholic countries. We\nvery rarely find in any of them an eminent man of letters, who is a\nprofessor in a university, except, perhaps, in the professions of law and\nphysic; professions from which the church is not so likely to draw them.\nAfter the church of Rome, that of England is by far the richest and best\nendowed church in Christendom. In England, accordingly, the church is\ncontinually draining the universities of all their best and ablest\nmembers; and an old college tutor who is known and distinguished in Europe\nas an eminent man of letters, is as rarely to be found there as in any\nRoman catholic country. In Geneva, on the contrary, in the protestant\ncantons of Switzerland, in the protestant countries of Germany, in\nHolland, in Scotland, in Sweden, and Denmark, the most eminent men of\nletters whom those countries have produced, have, not all indeed, but the\nfar greater part of them, been professors in universities. In those\ncountries, the universities are continually draining the church of all its\nmost eminent men of letters.\nIt may, perhaps, be worth while to remark, that, if we except the poets, a\nfew orators, and a few historians, the far greater part of the other\neminent men of letters, both of Greece and Rome, appear to have been\neither public or private teachers; generally either of philosophy or of\nrhetoric. This remark will be found to hold true, from the days of Lysias\nand Isocrates, of Plato and Aristotle, down to those of Plutarch and\nEpictetus, Suetonius, and Quintilian. To impose upon any man the necessity\nof teaching, year after year, in any particular branch of science seems in\nreality to be the most effectual method for rendering him completely\nmaster of it himself. By being obliged to go every year over the same\nground, if he is good for any thing, he necessarily becomes, in a few\nyears, well acquainted with every part of it, and if, upon any particular\npoint, he should form too hasty an opinion one year, when he comes, in the\ncourse of his lectures to reconsider the same subject the year thereafter,\nhe is very likely to correct it. As to be a teacher of science is\ncertainly the natural employment of a mere man of letters; so is it\nlikewise, perhaps, the education which is most likely to render him a man\nof solid learning and knowledge. The mediocrity of church benefices\nnaturally tends to draw the greater part of men of letters in the country\nwhere it takes place, to the employment in which they can be the most\nuseful to the public, and at the same time to give them the best\neducation, perhaps, they are capable of receiving. It tends to render\ntheir learning both as solid as possible, and as useful as possible.\nThe revenue of every established church, such parts of it excepted as may\narise from particular lands or manors, is a branch, it ought to be\nobserved, of the general revenue of the state, which is thus diverted to a\npurpose very different from the defence of the state. The tithe, for\nexample, is a real land tax, which puts it out of the power of the\nproprietors of land to contribute so largely towards the defence of the\nstate as they otherwise might be able to do. The rent of land, however,\nis, according to some, the sole fund; and, according to others, the\nprincipal fund, from which, in all great monarchies, the exigencies of the\nstate must be ultimately supplied. The more of this fund that is given to\nthe church, the less, it is evident, can be spared to the state. It may be\nlaid down as a certain maxim, that all other things being supposed equal,\nthe richer the church, the poorer must necessarily be, either the\nsovereign on the one hand, or the people on the other; and, in all cases,\nthe less able must the state be to defend itself. In several protestant\ncountries, particularly in all the protestant cantons of Switzerland, the\nrevenue which anciently belonged to the Roman catholic church, the tithes\nand church lands, has been found a fund sufficient, not only to afford\ncompetent salaries to the established clergy, but to defray, with little\nor no addition, all the other expenses of the state. The magistrates of\nthe powerful canton of Berne, in particular, have accumulated, out of the\nsavings from this fund, a very large sum, supposed to amount to several\nmillions; part of which is deposited in a public treasure, and part is\nplaced at interest in what are called the public funds of the different\nindebted nations of Europe; chiefly in those of France and Great Britain.\nWhat may be the amount of the whole expense which the church, either of\nBerne, or of any other protestant canton, costs the state, I do not\npretend to know. By a very exact account it appears, that, in 1755, the\nwhole revenue of the clergy of the church of Scotland, including their\nglebe or church lands, and the rent of their manses or dwelling-houses,\nestimated according to a reasonable valuation, amounted only to\n\u00a368,514:1:5 \u00b9\u2044\u2081\u2082d. This very moderate revenue affords a decent subsistence\nto nine hundred and forty-four ministers. The whole expense of the church,\nincluding what is occasionally laid out for the building and reparation of\nchurches, and of the manses of ministers, cannot well be supposed to\nexceed eighty or eighty-five thousand pounds a-year. The most opulent\nchurch in Christendom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith,\nthe fervour of devotion, the spirit of order, regularity, and austere\nmorals, in the great body of the people, than this very poorly endowed\nchurch of Scotland. All the good effects, both civil and religious, which\nan established church can be supposed to produce, are produced by it as\ncompletely as by any other. The greater part of the protestant churches of\nSwitzerland, which, in general, are not better endowed than the church of\nScotland, produce those effects in a still higher degree. In the greater\npart of the protestant cantons, there is not a single person to be found,\nwho does not profess himself to be of the established church. If he\nprofesses himself to be of any other, indeed, the law obliges him to leave\nthe canton. But so severe, or, rather, indeed, so oppressive a law, could\nnever have been executed in such free countries, had not the diligence of\nthe clergy beforehand converted to the established church the whole body\nof the people, with the exception of, perhaps, a few individuals only. In\nsome parts of Switzerland, accordingly, where, from the accidental union\nof a protestant and Roman catholic country, the conversion has not been so\ncomplete, both religions are not only tolerated, but established by law.\nThe proper performance of every service seems to require, that its pay or\nrecompence should be, as exactly as possible, proportioned to the nature\nof the service. If any service is very much underpaid, it is very apt to\nsuffer by the meanness and incapacity of the greater part of those who are\nemployed in it. If it is very much overpaid, it is apt to suffer, perhaps\nstill more, by their negligence and idleness. A man of a large revenue,\nwhatever may be his profession, thinks he ought to live like other men of\nlarge revenues; and to spend a great part of his time in festivity, in\nvanity, and in dissipation. But in a clergyman, this train of life not\nonly consumes the time which ought to be employed in the duties of his\nfunction, but in the eyes of the common people, destroys almost entirely\nthat sanctity of character, which can alone enable him to perform those\nduties with proper weight and authority.\nPART IV. Of the Expense of supporting the Dignity of the Sovereign.\nOver and above the expenses necessary for enabling the sovereign to\nperform his several duties, a certain expense is requisite for the support\nof his dignity. This expense varies, both with the different periods of\nimprovement, and with the different forms of government.\nIn an opulent and improved society, where all the different orders of\npeople are growing every day more expensive in their houses, in their\nfurniture, in their tables, in their dress, and in their equipage; it\ncannot well be expected that the sovereign should alone hold out against\nthe fashion. He naturally, therefore, or rather necessarily, becomes more\nexpensive in all those different articles too. His dignity even seems to\nrequire that he should become so.\nAs, in point of dignity, a monarch is more raised above his subjects than\nthe chief magistrate of any republic is ever supposed to be above his\nfellow-citizens; so a greater expense is necessary for supporting that\nhigher dignity. We naturally expect more splendour in the court of a king,\nthan in the mansion-house of a doge or burgo-master.\nCONCLUSION.\nThe expense of defending the society, and that of supporting the dignity\nof the chief magistrate, are both laid out for the general benefit of the\nwhole society. It is reasonable, therefore, that they should be defrayed\nby the general contribution of the whole society; all the different\nmembers contributing, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their\nrespective abilities.\nThe expense of the administration of justice, too, may no doubt be\nconsidered as laid out for the benefit of the whole society. There is no\nimpropriety, therefore, in its being defrayed by the general contribution\nof the whole society. The persons, however, who give occasion to this\nexpense, are those who, by their injustice in one way or another, make it\nnecessary to seek redress or protection from the courts of justice. The\npersons, again, most immediately benefited by this expense, are those whom\nthe courts of justice either restore to their rights, or maintain in their\nrights. The expense of the administration of justice, therefore, may very\nproperly be defrayed by the particular contribution of one or other, or\nboth, of those two different sets of persons, according as different\noccasions may require, that is, by the fees of court. It cannot be\nnecessary to have recourse to the general contribution of the whole\nsociety, except for the conviction of those criminals who have not\nthemselves any estate or fund sufficient for paying those fees.\nThose local or provincial expenses, of which the benefit is local or\nprovincial (what is laid out, for example, upon the police of a particular\ntown or district), ought to be defrayed by a local or provincial revenue,\nand ought to be no burden upon the general revenue of the society. It is\nunjust that the whole society should contribute towards an expense, of\nwhich the benefit is confined to a part of the society.\nThe expense of maintaining good roads and communications is, no doubt,\nbeneficial to the whole society, and may, therefore, without any\ninjustice, be defrayed by the general contributions of the whole society.\nThis expense, however, is most immediately and directly beneficial to\nthose who travel or carry goods from one place to another, and to those\nwho consume such goods. The turnpike tolls in England, and the duties\ncalled peages in other countries, lay it altogether upon those two\ndifferent sets of people, and thereby discharge the general revenue of the\nsociety from a very considerable burden.\nThe expense of the institutions for education and religious instruction,\nis likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole society, and may,\ntherefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general contribution of\nthe whole society. This expense, however, might, perhaps, with equal\npropriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether by those\nwho receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction, or by\nthe voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for\neither the one or the other.\nWhen the institutions, or public works, which are beneficial to the whole\nsociety, either cannot be maintained altogether, or are not maintained\naltogether, by the contribution of such particular members of the society\nas are most immediately benefited by them; the deficiency must, in most\ncases, be made up by the general contribution of the whole society. The\ngeneral revenue of the society, over and above defraying the expense of\ndefending the society, and of supporting the dignity of the chief\nmagistrate, must make up for the deficiency of many particular branches of\nrevenue. The sources of this general or public revenue, I shall endeavour\nto explain in the following chapter.\nCHAPTER II.\nOF THE SOURCES OF THE GENERAL OR PUBLIC\nREVENUE OF THE SOCIETY.\nThe revenue which must defray, not only the expense of defending the\nsociety and of supporting the dignity of the chief magistrate, but all the\nother necessary expenses of government, for which the constitution of the\nstate has not provided any particular revenue may be drawn, either, first,\nfrom some fund which peculiarly belongs to the sovereign or commonwealth,\nand which is independent of the revenue of the people; or, secondly, from\nthe revenue of the people.\nPART I. Of the Funds, or Sources, of Revenue, which may peculiarly belong\nto the Sovereign or Commonwealth.\nThe funds, or sources, of revenue, which may peculiarly belong to the\nsovereign or commonwealth, must consist, either in stock, or in land.\nThe sovereign, like, any other owner of stock, may derive a revenue from\nit, either by employing it himself, or by lending it. His revenue is, in\nthe one case, profit, in the other interest.\nThe revenue of a Tartar or Arabian chief consists in profit. It arises\nprincipally from the milk and increase of his own herds and flocks, of\nwhich he himself superintends the management, and is the principal\nshepherd or herdsman of his own horde or tribe. It is, however, in this\nearliest and rudest state of civil government only, that profit has ever\nmade the principal part of the public revenue of a monarchical state.\nSmall republics have sometimes derived a considerable revenue from the\nprofit of mercantile projects. The republic of Hamburgh is said to do so\nfrom the profits of a public wine-cellar and apothecary\u2019s shop. {See\nMemoires concernant les Droits et Impositions en Europe, tome i. page 73.\nThis work was compiled by the order of the court, for the use of a\ncommission employed for some years past in considering the proper means\nfor reforming the finances of France. The account of the French taxes,\nwhich takes up three volumes in quarto, may be regarded as perfectly\nauthentic. That of those of other European nations was compiled from such\ninformation as the French ministers at the different courts could procure.\nIt is much shorter, and probably not quite so exact as that of the French\ntaxes.} That state cannot be very great, of which the sovereign has\nleisure to carry on the trade of a wine-merchant or an apothecary. The\nprofit of a public bank has been a source of revenue to more considerable\nstates. It has been so, not only to Hamburgh, but to Venice and Amsterdam.\nA revenue of this kind has even by some people been thought not below the\nattention of so great an empire as that of Great Britain. Reckoning the\nordinary dividend of the bank of England at five and a-half per cent., and\nits capital at ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds, the\nneat annual profit, after paying the expense of management, must amount,\nit is said, to five hundred and ninety-two thousand nine hundred pounds.\nGovernment, it is pretended, could borrow this capital at three per cent.\ninterest, and, by taking the management of the bank into its own hands,\nmight make a clear profit of two hundred and sixty-nine thousand five\nhundred pounds a-year. The orderly, vigilant, and parsimonious\nadministration of such aristocracies as those of Venice and Amsterdam, is\nextremely proper, it appears from experience, for the management of a\nmercantile project of this kind. But whether such a government as that of\nEngland, which, whatever may be its virtues, has never been famous for\ngood economy; which, in time of peace, has generally conducted itself with\nthe slothful and negligent profusion that is, perhaps, natural to\nmonarchies; and, in time of war, has constantly acted with all the\nthoughtless extravagance that democracies are apt to fall into, could be\nsafely trusted with the management of such a project, must at least be a\ngood deal more doubtful.\nThe post-office is properly a mercantile project. The government advances\nthe expense of establishing the different offices, and of buying or hiring\nthe necessary horses or carriages, and is repaid, with a large profit, by\nthe duties upon what is carried. It is, perhaps, the only mercantile\nproject which has been successfully managed by, I believe, every sort of\ngovernment. The capital to be advanced is not very considerable. There is\nno mystery in the business. The returns are not only certain but\nimmediate.\nPrinces, however, have frequently engaged in many other mercantile\nprojects, and have been willing, like private persons, to mend their\nfortunes, by becoming adventurers in the common branches of trade. They\nhave scarce ever succeeded. The profusion with which the affairs of\nprinces are always managed, renders it almost impossible that they should.\nThe agents of a prince regard the wealth of their master as inexhaustible;\nare careless at what price they buy, are careless at what price they sell,\nare careless at what expense they transport his goods from one place to\nanother. Those agents frequently live with the profusion of princes; and\nsometimes, too, in spite of that profusion, and by a proper method of\nmaking up their accounts, acquire the fortunes of princes. It was thus, as\nwe are told by Machiavel, that the agents of Lorenzo of Medicis, not a\nprince of mean abilities, carried on his trade. The republic of Florence\nwas several times obliged to pay the debt into which their extravagance\nhad involved him. He found it convenient, accordingly to give up the\nbusiness of merchant, the business to which his family had originally owed\ntheir fortune, and, in the latter part of his life, to employ both what\nremained of that fortune, and the revenue of the state, of which he had\nthe disposal, in projects and expenses more suitable to his station.\nNo two characters seem more inconsistent than those of trader and\nsovereign. If the trading spirit of the English East India company renders\nthem very bad sovereigns, the spirit of sovereignty seems to have rendered\nthem equally bad traders. While they were traders only, they managed their\ntrade successfully, and were able to pay from their profits a moderate\ndividend to the proprietors of their stock. Since they became sovereigns,\nwith a revenue which, it is said, was originally more than three millions\nsterling, they have been obliged to beg the ordinary assistance of\ngovernment, in order to avoid immediate bankruptcy. In their former\nsituation, their servants in India considered themselves as the clerks of\nmerchants; in their present situation, those servants consider themselves\nas the ministers of sovereigns.\nA state may sometimes derive some part of its public revenue from the\ninterest of money, as well as from the profits of stock. If it has amassed\na treasure, it may lend a part of that treasure, either to foreign states,\nor to its own subjects.\nThe canton of Berne derives a considerable revenue by lending a part of\nits treasure to foreign states, that is, by placing it in the public funds\nof the different indebted nations of Europe, chiefly in those of France\nand England. The security of this revenue must depend, first, upon the\nsecurity of the funds in which it is placed, or upon the good faith of the\ngovernment which has the management of them; and, secondly, upon the\ncertainty or probability of the continuance of peace with the debtor\nnation. In the case of a war, the very first act of hostility on the part\nof the debtor nation might be the forfeiture of the funds of its credit.\nThis policy of lending money to foreign states is, so far as I know\npeculiar to the canton of Berne.\nThe city of Hamburgh {See Memoire concernant les Droites et Impositions en\nEurope tome i p. 73.}has established a sort of public pawn-shop, which\nlends money to the subjects of the state, upon pledges, at six per cent.\ninterest. This pawn-shop, or lombard, as it is called, affords a revenue,\nit is pretended, to the state, of a hundred and fifty thousand crowns,\nwhich, at four and sixpence the crown, amounts to \u00a333,750 sterling.\nThe government of Pennsylvania, without amassing any treasure, invented a\nmethod of lending, not money, indeed, but what is equivalent to money, to\nits subjects. By advancing to private people, at interest, and upon land\nsecurity to double the value, paper bills of credit, to be redeemed\nfifteen years after their date; and, in the mean time, made transferable\nfrom hand to hand, like banknotes, and declared by act of assembly to be a\nlegal tender in all payments from one inhabitant of the province to\nanother, it raised a moderate revenue, which went a considerable way\ntowards defraying an annual expense of about \u00a34,500, the whole ordinary\nexpense of that frugal and orderly government. The success of an expedient\nof this kind must have depended upon three different circumstances: first,\nupon the demand for some other instrument of commerce, besides gold and\nsilver money, or upon the demand for such a quantity of consumable stock\nas could not be had without sending abroad the greater part of their gold\nand silver money, in order to purchase it; secondly, upon the good credit\nof the government which made use of this expedient; and, thirdly, upon the\nmoderation with which it was used, the whole value of the paper bills of\ncredit never exceeding that of the gold and silver money which would have\nbeen necessary for carrying on their circulation, had there been no paper\nbills of credit. The same expedient was, upon different occasions, adopted\nby several other American colonies; but, from want of this moderation, it\nproduced, in the greater part of them, much more disorder than\nconveniency.\nThe unstable and perishable nature of stock and credit, however, renders\nthem unfit to be trusted to as the principal funds of that sure, steady,\nand permanent revenue, which can alone give security and dignity to\ngovernment. The government of no great nation, that was advanced beyond\nthe shepherd state, seems ever to have derived the greater part of its\npublic revenue from such sources.\nLand is a fund of more stable and permanent nature; and the rent of public\nlands, accordingly, has been the principal source of the public revenue of\nmany a great nation that was much advanced beyond the shepherd state. From\nthe produce or rent of the public lands, the ancient republics of Greece\nand Italy derived for a long time the greater part of that revenue which\ndefrayed the necessary expenses of the commonwealth. The rent of the crown\nlands constituted for a long time the greater part of the revenue of the\nancient sovereigns of Europe.\nWar, and the preparation for war, are the two circumstances which, in\nmodern times, occasion the greater part of the necessary expense or all\ngreat states. But in the ancient republics of Greece and Italy, every\ncitizen was a soldier, and both served, and prepared himself for service,\nat his own expense. Neither of those two circumstances, therefore, could\noccasion any very considerable expense to the state. The rent of a very\nmoderate landed estate might be fully sufficient for defraying all the\nother necessary expenses of government.\nIn the ancient monarchies of Europe, the manners and customs of the time\nsufficiently prepared the great body of the people for war; and when they\ntook the field, they were, by the condition of their feudal tenures, to be\nmaintained either at their own expense, or at that of their immediate\nlords, without bringing any new charge upon the sovereign. The other\nexpenses of government were, the greater part of them, very moderate. The\nadministration of justice, it has been shewn, instead of being a cause of\nexpense was a source of revenue. The labour of the country people, for\nthree days before, and for three days after, harvest, was thought a fund\nsufficient for making and maintaining all the bridges, highways, and other\npublic works, which the commerce of the country was supposed to require.\nIn those days the principal expense of the sovereign seems to have\nconsisted in the maintenance of his own family and household. The officers\nof his household, accordingly, were then the great officers of state. The\nlord treasurer received his rents. The lord steward and lord chamberlain\nlooked after the expense of his family. The care of his stables was\ncommitted to the lord constable and the lord marshal. His houses were all\nbuilt in the form of castles, and seem to have been the principal\nfortresses which he possessed. The keepers of those houses or castles\nmight be considered as a sort of military governors. They seem to have\nbeen the only military officers whom it was necessary to maintain in time\nof peace. In these circumstances, the rent of a great landed estate might,\nupon ordinary occasions, very well defray all the necessary expenses of\ngovernment.\nIn the present state of the greater part of the civilized monarchies of\nEurope, the rent of all the lands in the country, managed as they probably\nwould be, if they all belonged to one proprietor, would scarce, perhaps,\namount to the ordinary revenue which they levy upon the people even in\npeaceable times. The ordinary revenue of Great Britain, for example,\nincluding not only what is necessary for defraying the current expense of\nthe year, but for paying the interest of the public debts, and for sinking\na part of the capital of those debts, amounts to upwards of ten millions\na-year. But the land tax, at four shillings in the pound, falls short of\ntwo millions a-year. This land tax, as it is called however, is supposed\nto be one-fifth, not only of the rent of all the land, but of that of all\nthe houses, and of the interest of all the capital stock of Great Britain,\nthat part of it only excepted which is either lent to the public, or\nemployed as farming stock in the cultivation of land. A very considerable\npart of the produce of this tax arises from the rent of houses and the\ninterest of capital stock. The land tax of the city of London, for\nexample, at four shillings in the pound, amounts to \u00a3123,399: 6: 7; that\nof the city of Westminster to \u00a363,092: 1: 5; that of the palaces of\nWhitehall and St. James\u2019s, to \u00a330,754: 6: 3. A certain proportion of the\nland tax is, in the same manner, assessed upon all the other cities and\ntowns corporate in the kingdom; and arises almost altogether, either from\nthe rent of houses, or from what is supposed to be the interest of trading\nand capital stock. According to the estimation, therefore, by which Great\nBritain is rated to the land tax, the whole mass of revenue arising from\nthe rent of all the lands, from that of all the houses, and from the\ninterest of all the capital stock, that part of it only excepted which is\neither lent to the public, or employed in the cultivation of land, does\nnot exceed ten millions sterling a-year, the ordinary revenue which\ngovernment levies upon the people, even in peaceable times. The estimation\nby which Great Britain is rated to the land tax is, no doubt, taking the\nwhole kingdom at an average, very much below the real value; though in\nseveral particular counties and districts it is said to be nearly equal to\nthat value. The rent of the lands alone, exclusive of that of houses and\nof the interest of stock, has by many people been estimated at twenty\nmillions; an estimation made in a great measure at random, and which, I\napprehend, is as likely to be above as below the truth. But if the lands\nof Great Britain, in the present state of their cultivation, do not afford\na rent of more than twenty millions a-year, they could not well afford the\nhalf, most probably not the fourth part of that rent, if they all belonged\nto a single proprietor, and were put under the negligent, expensive, and\noppressive management of his factors and agents. The crown lands of Great\nBritain do not at present afford the fourth part of the rent which could\nprobably be drawn from them if they were the property of private persons.\nIf the crown lands were more extensive, it is probable, they would be\nstill worse managed.\nThe revenue which the great body of the people derives from land is, in\nproportion, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. The whole\nannual produce of the land of every country, if we except what is reserved\nfor seed, is either annually consumed by the great body of the people, or\nexchanged for something else that is consumed by them. Whatever keeps down\nthe produce of the land below what it would otherwise rise to, keeps down\nthe revenue of the great body of the people, still more than it does that\nof the proprietors of land. The rent of land, that portion of the produce\nwhich belongs to the proprietors, is scarce anywhere in Great Britain\nsupposed to be more than a third part of the whole produce. If the land\nwhich, in one state of cultivation, affords a revenue of ten millions\nsterling a-year, would in another afford a rent of twenty millions; the\nrent being, in both cases, supposed a third part of the produce, the\nrevenue of the proprietors would be less than it otherwise might be, by\nten millions a-year only; but the revenue of the great body of the people\nwould be less than it otherwise might be, by thirty millions a-year,\ndeducting only what would be necessary for seed. The population of the\ncountry would be less by the number of people which thirty millions\na-year, deducting always the seed, could maintain, according to the\nparticular mode of living, and expense which might take place in the\ndifferent ranks of men, among whom the remainder was distributed.\nThough there is not at present in Europe, any civilized state of any kind\nwhich derives the greater part of its public revenue from the rent of\nlands which are the property of the state; yet, in all the great\nmonarchies of Europe, there are still many large tracts of land which\nbelong to the crown. They are generally forest, and sometimes forests\nwhere, after travelling several miles, you will scarce find a single tree;\na mere waste and loss of country, in respect both of produce and\npopulation. In every great monarchy of Europe, the sale of the crown lands\nwould produce a very large sum of money, which, if applied to the payment\nof the public debts, would deliver from mortgage a much greater revenue\nthan any which those lands have ever afforded to the crown. In countries\nwhere lands, improved and cultivated very highly, and yielding, at the\ntime of sale, as great a rent as can easily be got from them, commonly\nsell at thirty years purchase; the unimproved, uncultivated, and\nlow-rented crown lands, might well be expected to sell at forty, fifty, or\nsixty years purchase. The crown might immediately enjoy the revenue which\nthis great price would redeem from mortgage. In the course of a few years,\nit would probably enjoy another revenue. When the crown lands had become\nprivate property, they would, in the course of a few years, become well\nimproved and well cultivated. The increase of their produce would increase\nthe population of the country, by augmenting the revenue and consumption\nof the people. But the revenue which the crown derives from the duties or\ncustom and excise, would necessarily increase with the revenue and\nconsumption of the people.\nThe revenue which, in any civilized monarchy, the crown derives from the\ncrown lands, though it appears to cost nothing to individuals, in reality\ncosts more to the society than perhaps any other equal revenue which the\ncrown enjoys. It would, in all cases, be for the interest of the society,\nto replace this revenue to the crown by some other equal revenue, and to\ndivide the lands among the people, which could not well be done better,\nperhaps, than by exposing them to public sale.\nLands, for the purposes of pleasure and magnificence, parks, gardens,\npublic walks, etc. possessions which are everywhere considered as causes\nof expense, not as sources of revenue, seem to be the only lands which, in\na great and civilized monarchy, ought to belong to the crown.\nPublic stock and public lands, therefore, the two sources of revenue which\nmay peculiarly belong to the sovereign or commonwealth, being both\nimproper and insufficient funds for defraying the necessary expense of any\ngreat and civilized state; it remains that this expense must, the greater\npart of it, be defrayed by taxes of one kind or another; the people\ncontributing a part of their own private revenue, in order to make up a\npublic revenue to the sovereign or commonwealth.\nPART II. Of Taxes.\nThe private revenue of individuals, it has been shown in the first book of\nthis Inquiry, arises, ultimately from three different sources; rent,\nprofit, and wages. Every tax must finally be paid from some one or other\nof those three different sources of revenue, or from all of them\nindifferently. I shall endeavour to give the best account I can, first, of\nthose taxes which, it is intended should fall upon rent; secondly, of\nthose which, it is intended should fall upon profit; thirdly, of those\nwhich, it is intended should fall upon wages; and fourthly, of those\nwhich, it is intended should fall indifferently upon all those three\ndifferent sources of private revenue. The particular consideration of each\nof these four different sorts of taxes will divide the second part of the\npresent chapter into four articles, three of which will require several\nother subdivisions. Many of these taxes, it will appear from the following\nreview, are not finally paid from the fund, or source of revenue, upon\nwhich it is intended they should fall.\nBefore I enter upon the examination of particular taxes, it is necessary\nto premise the four following maxims with regard to taxes in general.\n1. The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of\nthe government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective\nabilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively\nenjoy under the protection of the state. The expense of government to the\nindividuals of a great nation, is like the expense of management to the\njoint tenants of a great estate, who are all obliged to contribute in\nproportion to their respective interests in the estate. In the observation\nor neglect of this maxim, consists what is called the equality or\ninequality of taxation. Every tax, it must be observed once for all, which\nfalls finally upon one only of the three sorts of revenue above mentioned,\nis necessarily unequal, in so far as it does not affect the other two. In\nthe following examination of different taxes, I shall seldom take much\nfarther notice of this sort of inequality; but shall, in most cases,\nconfine my observations to that inequality which is occasioned by a\nparticular tax falling unequally upon that particular sort of private\nrevenue which is affected by it.\n2. The tax which each individual is bound to pay, ought to be certain and\nnot arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to\nbe paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every\nother person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject to the tax is\nput more or less in the power of the tax-gatherer, who can either\naggravate the tax upon any obnoxious contributor, or extort, by the terror\nof such aggravation, some present or perquisite to himself. The\nuncertainty of taxation encourages the insolence, and favours the\ncorruption, of an order of men who are naturally unpopular, even where\nthey are neither insolent nor corrupt. The certainty of what each\nindividual ought to pay is, in taxation, a matter of so great importance,\nthat a very considerable degree of inequality, it appears, I believe, from\nthe experience of all nations, is not near so great an evil as a very\nsmall degree of uncertainty.\n3. Every tax ought to be levied at the time, or in the manner, in which it\nis most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it. A tax upon\nthe rent of land or of houses, payable at the same term at which such\nrents are usually paid, is levied at the time when it is most likely to be\nconvenient for the contributor to pay; or when he is most likely to have\nwherewithall to pay. Taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of\nluxury, are all finally paid by the consumer, and generally in a manner\nthat is very convenient for him. He pays them by little and little, as he\nhas occasion to buy the goods. As he is at liberty too, either to buy or\nnot to buy, as he pleases, it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any\nconsiderable inconveniency from such taxes.\n4. Every tax ought to be so contrived, as both to take out and to keep out\nof the pockets of the people as little as possible, over and above what it\nbrings into the public treasury of the state. A tax may either take out or\nkeep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings\ninto the public treasury, in the four following ways. First, the levying\nof it may require a great number of officers, whose salaries may eat up\nthe greater part of the produce of the tax, and whose perquisites may\nimpose another additional tax upon the people. Secondly, it may obstruct\nthe industry of the people, and discourage them from applying to certain\nbranches of business which might give maintenance and employment to great\nmultitudes. While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish, or\nperhaps destroy, some of the funds which might enable them more easily to\ndo so. Thirdly, by the forfeitures and other penalties which those\nunfortunate individuals incur, who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the\ntax, it may frequently ruin them, and thereby put an end to the benefit\nwhich the community might have received from the employment of their\ncapitals. An injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling. But\nthe penalties of smuggling must arise in proportion to the temptation. The\nlaw, contrary to all the ordinary principles of justice, first creates the\ntemptation, and then punishes those who yield to it; and it commonly\nenhances the punishment, too, in proportion to the very circumstance which\nought certainly to alleviate it, the temptation to commit the crime. {See\nSketches of the History of Man page 474, and Seq.} Fourthly, by subjecting\nthe people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the\ntax-gatherers, it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble, vexation,\nand oppression; and though vexation is not, strictly speaking, expense, it\nis certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing\nto redeem himself from it. It is in some one or other of these four\ndifferent ways, that taxes are frequently so much more burdensome to the\npeople than they are beneficial to the sovereign.\nThe evident justice and utility of the foregoing maxims have recommended\nthem, more or less, to the attention of all nations. All nations have\nendeavoured, to the best of their judgment, to render their taxes as equal\nas they could contrive; as certain, as convenient to the contributor, both\nthe time and the mode of payment, and in proportion to the revenue which\nthey brought to the prince, as little burdensome to the people. The\nfollowing short review of some of the principal taxes which have taken\nplace in different ages and countries, will show, that the endeavours of\nall nations have not in this respect been equally successful.\nARTICLE I.\u2014Taxes upon Rent\u2014Taxes upon the Rent of Land.\nA tax upon the rent of land may either be imposed according to a certain\ncanon, every district being valued at a curtain rent, which valuation is\nnot afterwards to be altered; or it may be imposed in such a manner, as to\nvary with every variation in the real rent of the land, and to rise or\nfall with the improvement or declension of its cultivation.\nA land tax which, like that of Great Britain, is assessed upon each\ndistrict according to a certain invariable canon, though it should be\nequal at the time of its first establishment, necessarily becomes unequal\nin process of time, according to the unequal degrees of improvement or\nneglect in the cultivation of the different parts of the country. In\nEngland, the valuation, according to which the different counties and\nparishes were assessed to the land tax by the 4th of William and Mary, was\nvery unequal even at its first establishment. This tax, therefore, so far\noffends against the first of the four maxims above mentioned. It is\nperfectly agreeable to the other three. It is perfectly certain. The time\nof payment for the tax, being the same as that for the rent, is as\nconvenient as it can be to the contributor. Though the landlord is, in all\ncases, the real contributor, the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant,\nto whom the landlord is obliged to allow it in the payment of the rent.\nThis tax is levied by a much smaller number of officers than any other\nwhich affords nearly the same revenue. As the tax upon each district does\nnot rise with the rise of the rent, the sovereign does not share in the\nprofits of the landlord\u2019s improvements. Those improvements sometimes\ncontribute, indeed, to the discharge of the other landlords of the\ndistrict. But the aggravation of the tax, which this may sometimes\noccasion upon a particular estate, is always so very small, that it never\ncan discourage those improvements, nor keep down the produce of the land\nbelow what it would otherwise rise to. As it has no tendency to diminish\nthe quantity, it can have none to raise the price of that produce. It does\nnot obstruct the industry of the people; it subjects the landlord to no\nother inconveniency besides the unavoidable one of paying the tax. The\nadvantage, however, which the land-lord has derived from the invariable\nconstancy of the valuation, by which all the lands of Great Britain are\nrated to the land-tax, has been principally owing to some circumstances\naltogether extraneous to the nature of the tax.\nIt has been owing in part, to the great prosperity of almost every part of\nthe country, the rents of almost all the estates of Great Britain having,\nsince the time when this valuation was first established, been continually\nrising, and scarce any of them having fallen. The landlords, therefore,\nhave almost all gained the difference between the tax which they would\nhave paid, according to the present rent of their estates, and that which\nthey actually pay according to the ancient valuation. Had the state of the\ncountry been different, had rents been gradually falling in consequence of\nthe declension of cultivation, the landlords would almost all have lost\nthis difference. In the state of things which has happened to take place\nsince the revolution, the constancy of the valuation has been advantageous\nto the landlord and hurtful to the sovereign. In a different state of\nthings it might have been advantageous to the sovereign and hurtful to the\nlandlord.\nAs the tax is made payable in money, so the valuation of the land is\nexpressed in money. Since the establishment of this valuation, the value\nof silver has been pretty uniform, and there has been no alteration in the\nstandard of the coin, either as to weight or fineness. Had silver risen\nconsiderably in its value, as it seems to have done in the course of the\ntwo centuries which preceded the discovery of the mines of America, the\nconstancy of the valuation might have proved very oppressive to the\nlandlord. Had silver fallen considerably in its value, as it certainly did\nfor about a century at least after the discovery of those mines, the same\nconstancy of valuation would have reduced very much this branch of the\nrevenue of the sovereign. Had any considerable alteration been made in the\nstandard of the money, either by sinking the same quantity of silver to a\nlower denomination, or by raising it to a higher; had an ounce of silver,\nfor example, instead of being coined into five shillings and two pence,\nbeen coined either into pieces which bore so low a denomination as two\nshillings and seven pence, or into pieces which bore so high a one as ten\nshillings and four pence, it would, in the one case, have hurt the revenue\nof the proprietor, in the other that of the sovereign.\nIn circumstances, therefore, somewhat different from those which have\nactually taken place, this constancy of valuation might have been a very\ngreat inconveniency, either to the contributors or to the commonwealth. In\nthe course of ages, such circumstances, however, must at some time or\nother happen. But though empires, like all the other works of men, have\nall hitherto proved mortal, yet every empire aims at immortality. Every\nconstitution, therefore, which it is meant should be as permanent as the\nempire itself, ought to be convenient, not in certain circumstances only,\nbut in all circumstances; or ought to be suited, not to those\ncircumstances which are transitory, occasional, or accidental, but to\nthose which are necessary, and therefore always the same.\nA tax upon the rent of land, which varies with every variation of the\nrent, or which rises and falls according to the improvement or neglect of\ncultivation, is recommended by that sect of men of letters in France, who\ncall themselves the economists, as the most equitable of all taxes. All\ntaxes, they pretend, fall ultimately upon the rent of land, and ought,\ntherefore, to be imposed equally upon the fund which must finally pay\nthem. That all taxes ought to fall as equally as possible upon the fund\nwhich must finally pay them, is certainly true. But without entering into\nthe disagreeable discussion of the metaphysical arguments by which they\nsupport their very ingenious theory, it will sufficiently appear, from the\nfollowing review, what are the taxes which fall finally upon the rent of\nthe land, and what are those which fall finally upon some other fund.\nIn the Venetian territory, all the arable lands which are given in lease\nto farmers are taxed at a tenth of the rent. {Memoires concernant les\nDroits, p. 240, 241.} The leases are recorded in a public register, which\nis kept by the officers of revenue in each province or district. When the\nproprietor cultivates his own lands, they are valued according to an\nequitable estimation, and he is allowed a deduction of one-fifth of the\ntax; so that for such land he pays only eight instead of ten per cent. of\nthe supposed rent.\nA land-tax of this kind is certainly more equal than the land-tax of\nEngland. It might not, perhaps, be altogether so certain, and the\nassessment of the tax might frequently occasion a good deal more trouble\nto the landlord. It might, too, be a good deal more expensive in the\nlevying.\nSuch a system of administration, however, might, perhaps, be contrived, as\nwould in a great measure both prevent this uncertainty, and moderate this\nexpense.\nThe landlord and tenant, for example, might jointly be obliged to record\ntheir lease in a public register. Proper penalties might be enacted\nagainst concealing or misrepresenting any of the conditions; and if part\nof those penalties were to be paid to either of the two parties who\ninformed against and convicted the other of such concealment or\nmisrepresentation, it would effectually deter them from combining together\nin order to defraud the public revenue. All the conditions of the lease\nmight be sufficiently known from such a record.\nSome landlords, instead of raising the rent, take a fine for the renewal\nof the lease. This practice is, in most cases, the expedient of a\nspendthrift, who, for a sum of ready money sells a future revenue of much\ngreater value. It is, in most cases, therefore, hurtful to the landlord;\nit is frequently hurtful to the tenant; and it is always hurtful to the\ncommunity. It frequently takes from the tenant so great a part of his\ncapital, and thereby diminishes so much his ability to cultivate the land,\nthat he finds it more difficult to pay a small rent than it would\notherwise have been to pay a great one. Whatever diminishes his ability to\ncultivate, necessarily keeps down, below what it would otherwise have\nbeen, the most important part of the revenue of the community. By\nrendering the tax upon such fines a good deal heavier than upon the\nordinary rent, this hurtful practice might be discouraged, to the no small\nadvantage of all the different parties concerned, of the landlord, of the\ntenant, of the sovereign, and of the whole community.\nSome leases prescribe to the tenant a certain mode of cultivation, and a\ncertain succession of crops, during the whole continuance of the lease.\nThis condition, which is generally the effect of the landlord\u2019s conceit of\nhis own superior knowledge (a conceit in most cases very ill-founded),\nought always to be considered as an additional rent, as a rent in service,\ninstead of a rent in money. In order to discourage the practice, which is\ngenerally a foolish one, this species of rent might be valued rather high,\nand consequently taxed somewhat higher than common money-rents.\nSome landlords, instead of a rent in money, require a rent in kind, in\ncorn, cattle, poultry, wine, oil, etc.; others, again, require a rent in\nservice. Such rents are always more hurtful to the tenant than beneficial\nto the landlord. They either take more, or keep more out of the pocket of\nthe former, than they put into that of the latter. In every country where\nthey take place, the tenants are poor and beggarly, pretty much according\nto the degree in which they take place. By valuing, in the same manner,\nsuch rents rather high, and consequently taxing them somewhat higher than\ncommon money-rents, a practice which is hurtful to the whole community,\nmight, perhaps, be sufficiently discouraged.\nWhen the landlord chose to occupy himself a part of his own lands, the\nrent might be valued according to an equitable arbitration of the farmers\nand landlords in the neighbourhood, and a moderate abatement of the tax\nmight be granted to him, in the same manner as in the Venetian territory,\nprovided the rent of the lands which he occupied did not exceed a certain\nsum. It is of importance that the landlord should be encouraged to\ncultivate a part of his own land. His capital is generally greater than\nthat of the tenant, and, with less skill, he can frequently raise a\ngreater produce. The landlord can afford to try experiments, and is\ngenerally disposed to do so. His unsuccessful experiments occasion only a\nmoderate loss to himself. His successful ones contribute to the\nimprovement and better cultivation of the whole country. It might be of\nimportance, however, that the abatement of the tax should encourage him to\ncultivate to a certain extent only. If the landlords should, the greater\npart of them, be tempted to farm the whole of their own lands, the country\n(instead of sober and industrious tenants, who are bound by their own\ninterest to cultivate as well as their capital and skill will allow them)\nwould be filled with idle and profligate bailiffs, whose abusive\nmanagement would soon degrade the cultivation, and reduce the annual\nproduce of the land, to the diminution, not only of the revenue of their\nmasters, but of the most important part of that of the whole society.\nSuch a system of administration might, perhaps, free a tax of this kind\nfrom any degree of uncertainty, which could occasion either oppression or\ninconveniency to the contributor; and might, at the same time, serve to\nintroduce into the common management of land such a plan of policy as\nmight contribute a good deal to the general improvement and good\ncultivation of the country.\nThe expense of levying a land-tax, which varied with every variation of\nthe rent, would, no doubt, be somewhat greater than that of levying one\nwhich was always rated according to a fixed valuation. Some additional\nexpense would necessarily be incurred, both by the different\nregister-offices which it would be proper to establish in the different\ndistricts of the country, and by the different valuations which might\noccasionally be made of the lands which the proprietor chose to occupy\nhimself. The expense of all this, however, might be very moderate, and\nmuch below what is incurred in the levying of many other taxes, which\nafford a very inconsiderable revenue in comparison of what might easily be\ndrawn from a tax of this kind.\nThe discouragement which a variable land-tax of this kind might give to\nthe improvement of land, seems to be the most important objection which\ncan be made to it. The landlord would certainly be less disposed to\nimprove, when the sovereign, who contributed nothing to the expense, was\nto share in the profit of the improvement. Even this objection might,\nperhaps, be obviated, by allowing the landlord, before he began his\nimprovement, to ascertain, in conjunction with the officers of revenue,\nthe actual value of his lands, according to the equitable arbitration of a\ncertain number of landlords and farmers in the neighbourhood, equally\nchosen by both parties: and by rating him, according to this valuation,\nfor such a number of years as might be fully sufficient for his complete\nindemnification. To draw the attention of the sovereign towards the\nimprovement of the land, from a regard to the increase of his own revenue,\nis one or the principal advantages proposed by this species of land-tax.\nThe term, therefore, allowed, for the indemnification of the landlord,\nought not to be a great deal longer than what was necessary for that\npurpose, lest the remoteness of the interest should discourage too much\nthis attention. It had better, however, be somewhat too long, than in any\nrespect too short. No incitement to the attention of the sovereign can\never counterbalance the smallest discouragement to that of the landlord.\nThe attention of the sovereign can be, at best, but a very general and\nvague consideration of what is likely to contribute to the better\ncultivation of the greater part of his dominions. The attention of the\nlandlord is a particular and minute consideration of what is likely to be\nthe most advantageous application of every inch of ground upon his estate.\nThe principal attention of the sovereign ought to be, to encourage, by\nevery means in his power, the attention both of the landlord and of the\nfarmer, by allowing both to pursue their own interest in their own way,\nand according to their own judgment; by giving to both the most perfect\nsecurity that they shall enjoy the full recompence of their own industry;\nand by procuring to both the most extensive market for every part of their\nproduce, in consequence of establishing the easiest and safest\ncommunications, both by land and by water, through every part of his own\ndominions, as well as the most unbounded freedom of exportation to the\ndominions of all other princes.\nIf, by such a system of administration, a tax of this kind could be so\nmanaged as to give, not only no discouragement, but, on the contrary, some\nencouragement to the improvement or land, it does not appear likely to\noccasion any other inconveniency to the landlord, except always the\nunavoidable one of being obliged to pay the tax. In all the variations of\nthe state of the society, in the improvement and in the declension of\nagriculture; in all the variations in the value of silver, and in all\nthose in the standard of the coin, a tax of this kind would, of its own\naccord, and without any attention of government, readily suit itself to\nthe actual situation of things, and would be equally just and equitable in\nall those different changes. It would, therefore, be much more proper to\nbe established as a perpetual and unalterable regulation, or as what is\ncalled a fundamental law of the commonwealth, than any tax which was\nalways to be levied according to a certain valuation.\nSome states, instead of the simple and obvious expedient of a register of\nleases, have had recourse to the laborious and expensive one of an actual\nsurvey and valuation of all the lands in the country. They have suspected,\nprobably, that the lessor and lessee, in order to defraud the public\nrevenue, might combine to conceal the real terms of the lease.\nDoomsday-book seems to have been the result of a very accurate survey of\nthis kind.\nIn the ancient dominions of the king of Prussia, the land-tax is assessed\naccording to an actual survey and valuation, which is reviewed and altered\nfrom time to time. {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom, i. p. 114,\n115, 116, etc.} According to that valuation, the lay proprietors pay from\ntwenty to twenty-five per cent. of their revenue; ecclesiastics from forty\nto forty-five per cent. The survey and valuation of Silesia was made by\norder of the present king, it is said, with great accuracy. According to\nthat valuation, the lands belonging to the bishop of Breslaw are taxed at\ntwenty-five per cent. of their rent. The other revenues of the\necclesiastics of both religions at fifty per cent. The commanderies of the\nTeutonic order, and of that of Malta, at forty per cent. Lands held by a\nnoble tenure, at thirty-eight and one-third per cent. Lands held by a base\ntenure, at thirty-five and one-third per cent.\nThe survey and valuation of Bohemia is said to have been the work of more\nthan a hundred years. It was not perfected till after the peace of 1748,\nby the orders of the present empress queen. {Id. tom i. p.85, 84.} The\nsurvey of the duchy of Milan, which was begun in the time of Charles VI.,\nwas not perfected till after 1760. It is esteemed one of the most\naccurate that has ever been made. The survey of Savoy and Piedmont was\nexecuted under the orders of the late king of Sardinia. {Id. p. 280,\netc.; also p, 287. etc. to 316.}\nIn the dominions of the king of Prussia, the revenue of the church is\ntaxed much higher than that of lay proprietors. The revenue of the church\nis, the greater part of it, a burden upon the rent of land. It seldom\nhappens that any part of it is applied towards the improvement of land; or\nis so employed as to contribute, in any respect, towards increasing the\nrevenue of the great body of the people. His Prussian majesty had\nprobably, upon that account, thought it reasonable that it should\ncontribute a good deal more towards relieving the exigencies of the state.\nIn some countries, the lands of the church are exempted from all taxes. In\nothers, they are taxed more lightly than other lands. In the duchy of\nMilan, the lands which the church possessed before 1575, are rated to the\ntax at a third only or their value.\nIn Silesia, lands held by a noble tenure are taxed three per cent. higher\nthan those held by a base tenure. The honours and privileges of different\nkinds annexed to the former, his Prussian majesty had probably imagined,\nwould sufficiently compensate to the proprietor a small aggravation of the\ntax; while, at the same time, the humiliating inferiority of the latter\nwould be in some measure alleviated, by being taxed somewhat more lightly.\nIn other countries, the system of taxation, instead of alleviating,\naggravates this inequality. In the dominions of the king of Sardinia, and\nin those provinces of France which are subject to what is called the real\nor predial taille, the tax falls altogether upon the lands held by a base\ntenure. Those held by a noble one are exempted.\nA land tax assessed according to a general survey and valuation, how equal\nsoever it may be at first, must, in the course of a very moderate period\nof time, become unequal. To prevent its becoming so would require the\ncontinual and painful attention of government to all the variations in the\nstate and produce of every different farm in the country. The governments\nof Prussia, of Bohemia, of Sardinia, and of the duchy of Milan, actually\nexert an attention of this kind; an attention so unsuitable to the nature\nof government, that it is not likely to be of long continuance, and which,\nif it is continued, will probably, in the long-run, occasion much more\ntrouble and vexation than it can possibly bring relief to the\ncontributors.\nIn 1666, the generality of Montauban was assessed to the real or predial\ntaille, according, it is said, to a very exact survey and valuation.\n{Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom. ii p. 139, etc.} By 1727, this\nassessment had become altogether unequal. In order to remedy this\ninconveniency, government has found no better expedient, than to impose\nupon the whole generality an additional tax of a hundred and twenty\nthousand livres. This additional tax is rated upon all the different\ndistricts subject to the taille according to the old assessment. But it is\nlevied only upon those which, in the actual state of things, are by that\nassessment under-taxed; and it is applied to the relief of those which, by\nthe same assessment, are over-taxed. Two districts, for example, one of\nwhich ought, in the actual state of things, to be taxed at nine hundred,\nthe other at eleven hundred livres, are, by the old assessment, both taxed\nat a thousand livres. Both these districts are, by the additional tax,\nrated at eleven hundred livres each. But this additional tax is levied\nonly upon the district under-charged, and it is applied altogether to the\nrelief of that overcharged, which consequently pays only nine hundred\nlivres. The government neither gains nor loses by the additional tax,\nwhich is applied altogether to remedy the inequalities arising from the\nold assessment. The application is pretty much regulated according to the\ndiscretion of the intendant of the generality, and must, therefore, be in\na great measure arbitrary.\nTaxes which are proportioned, not in the Rent, but to the Produce of Land.\nTaxes upon the produce of land are, in reality, taxes upon the rent; and\nthough they may be originally advanced by the farmer, are finally paid by\nthe landlord. When a certain portion of the produce is to be paid away for\na tax, the farmer computes as well as he can, what the value of this\nportion is, one year with another, likely to amount to, and he makes a\nproportionable abatement in the rent which he agrees to pay to the\nlandlord. There is no farmer who does not compute beforehand what the\nchurch tythe, which is a land tax of this kind, is, one year with another,\nlikely to amount to.\nThe tythe, and every other land tax of this kind, under the appearance of\nperfect equality, are very unequal taxes; a certain portion of the produce\nbeing in different situations, equivalent to a very different portion of\nthe rent. In some very rich lands, the produce is so great, that the one\nhalf of it is fully sufficient to replace to the farmer his capital\nemployed in cultivation, together with the ordinary profits of farming\nstock in the neighbourhood. The other half, or, what comes to the same\nthing, the value of the other half, he could afford to pay as rent to the\nlandlord, if there was no tythe. But if a tenth of the produce is taken\nfrom him in the way of tythe, he must require an abatement of the fifth\npart of his rent, otherwise he cannot get back his capital with the\nordinary profit. In this case, the rent of the landlord, instead of\namounting to a half, or five-tenths of the whole produce, will amount only\nto four-tenths of it. In poorer lands, on the contrary, the produce is\nsometimes so small, and the expense of cultivation so great, that it\nrequires four-fifths of the whole produce, to replace to the farmer his\ncapital with the ordinary profit. In this case, though there was no tythe,\nthe rent of the landlord could amount to no more than one-fifth or\ntwo-tenths of the whole produce. But if the farmer pays one-tenth of the\nproduce in the way of tythe, he must require an equal abatement of the\nrent of the landlord, which will thus be reduced to one-tenth only of the\nwhole produce. Upon the rent of rich lands the tythe may sometimes be a\ntax of no more than one-fifth part, or four shillings in the pound;\nwhereas upon that of poorer lands, it may sometimes be a tax of one half,\nor of ten shillings in the pound.\nThe tythe, as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent, so it is\nalways a great discouragement, both to the improvements of the landlord,\nand to the cultivation of the farmer. The one cannot venture to make the\nmost important, which are generally the most expensive improvements; nor\nthe other to raise the most valuable, which are generally, too, the most\nexpensive crops; when the church, which lays out no part of the expense,\nis to share so very largely in the profit. The cultivation of madder was,\nfor a long time, confined by the tythe to the United Provinces, which,\nbeing presbyterian countries, and upon that account exempted from this\ndestructive tax, enjoyed a sort of monopoly of that useful dyeing drug\nagainst the rest of Europe. The late attempts to introduce the culture of\nthis plant into England, have been made only in consequence of the\nstatute, which enacted that five shillings an acre should be received in\nlieu of all manner of tythe upon madder.\nAs through the greater part of Europe, the church, so in many different\ncountries of Asia, the state, is principally supported by a land tax,\nproportioned not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. In China,\nthe principal revenue of the sovereign consists in a tenth part of the\nproduce of all the lands of the empire. This tenth part, however, is\nestimated so very moderately, that, in many provinces, it is said not to\nexceed a thirtieth part of the ordinary produce. The land tax or land rent\nwhich used to be paid to the Mahometan government of Bengal, before that\ncountry fell into the hands of the English East India company, is said to\nhave amounted to about a fifth part of the produce. The land tax of\nancient Egypt is said likewise to have amounted to a fifth part.\nIn Asia, this sort of land tax is said to interest the sovereign in the\nimprovement and cultivation of land. The sovereigns of China, those of\nBengal while under the Mahometan govermnent, and those of ancient Egypt,\nare said, accordingly, to have been extremely attentive to the making and\nmaintaining of good roads and navigable canals, in order to increase, as\nmuch as possible, both the quantity and value of every part of the produce\nof the land, by procuring to every part of it the most extensive market\nwhich their own dominions could afford. The tythe of the church is divided\ninto such small portions that no one of its proprietors can have any\ninterest of this kind. The parson of a parish could never find his\naccount, in making a road or canal to a distant part of the country, in\norder to extend the market for the produce of his own particular parish.\nSuch taxes, when destined for the maintenance of the state, have some\nadvantages, which may serve in some measure to balance their\ninconveniency. When destined for the maintenance of the church, they are\nattended with nothing but inconveniency.\nTaxes upon the produce of land may be levied, either in kind, or,\naccording to a certain valuation in money.\nThe parson of a parish, or a gentleman of small fortune who lives upon his\nestate, may sometimes, perhaps find some advantage in receiving, the one\nhis tythe, and the other his rent, in kind. The quantity to be collected,\nand the district within which it is to be collected, are so small, that\nthey both can oversee, with their own eyes, the collection and disposal of\nevery part of what is due to them. A gentleman of great fortune, who lived\nin the capital, would be in danger of suffering much by the neglect, and\nmore by the fraud, of his factors and agents, if the rents of an estate in\na distant province were to be paid to him in this manner. The loss of the\nsovereign, from the abuse and depredation of his tax-gatherers, would\nnecessarily be much greater. The servants of the most careless private\nperson are, perhaps, more under the eye of their master than those of the\nmost careful prince; and a public revenue, which was paid in kind, would\nsuffer so much from the mismanagement of the collectors, that a very small\npart of what was levied upon the people would ever arrive at the treasury\nof the prince. Some part of the public revenue of China, however, is said\nto be paid in this manner. The mandarins and other tax-gatherers will, no\ndoubt, find their advantage in continuing the practice of a payment, which\nis so much more liable to abuse than any payment in money.\nA tax upon the produce of land, which is levied in money, may be levied,\neither according to a valuation, which varies with all the variations of\nthe market price; or according to a fixed valuation, a bushel of wheat,\nfor example, being always valued at one and the same money price, whatever\nmay be the state of the market. The produce of a tax levied in the former\nway will vary only according to the variations in the real produce of the\nland, according to the improvement or neglect of cultivation. The produce\nof a tax levied in the latter way will vary, not only according to the\nvariations in the produce of the land, but according both to those in the\nvalue of the precious metals, and those in the quantity of those metals\nwhich is at different times contained in coin of the same denomination.\nThe produce of the former will always bear the same proportion to the\nvalue of the real produce of the land. The produce of the latter may, at\ndifferent times, bear very different proportions to that value.\nWhen, instead either of a certain portion of the produce of land, or of\nthe price of a certain portion, a certain sum of money is to be paid in\nfull compensation for all tax or tythe; the tax becomes, in this case,\nexactly of the same nature with the land tax of England. It neither rises\nnor falls with the rent of the land. It neither encourages nor discourages\nimprovement. The tythe in the greater part of those parishes which pay\nwhat is called a modus, in lieu of all other tythe is a tax of this kind.\nDuring the Mahometan government of Bengal, instead of the payment in kind\nof the fifth part of the produce, a modus, and, it is said, a very\nmoderate one, was established in the greater part of the districts or\nzemindaries of the country. Some of the servants of the East India\ncompany, under pretence of restoring the public revenue to its proper\nvalue, have, in some provinces, exchanged this modus for a payment in\nkind. Under their management, this change is likely both to discourage\ncultivation, and to give new opportunities for abuse in the collection of\nthe public revenue, which has fallen very much below what it was said to\nhave been when it first fell under the management of the company. The\nservants of the company may, perhaps, have profited by the change, but at\nthe expense, it is probable, both of their masters and of the country.\nTaxes upon the Rent of Houses.\nThe rent of a house may be distinguished into two parts, of which the one\nmay very properly be called the building-rent; the other is commonly\ncalled the ground-rent.\nThe building-rent is the interest or profit of the capital expended in\nbuilding the house. In order to put the trade of a builder upon a level\nwith other trades, it is necessary that this rent should be sufficient,\nfirst, to pay him the same interest which he would have got for his\ncapital, if he had lent it upon good security; and, secondly, to keep the\nhouse in constant repair, or, what comes to the same thing, to replace,\nwithin a certain term of years, the capital which had been employed in\nbuilding it. The building-rent, or the ordinary profit of building, is,\ntherefore, everywhere regulated by the ordinary interest of money. Where\nthe market rate of interest is four per cent. the rent of a house, which,\nover and above paying the ground-rent, affords six or six and a-half per\ncent. upon the whole expense of building, may, perhaps, afford a\nsufficient profit to the builder. Where the market rate of interest is\nfive per cent. it may perhaps require seven or seven and a half per cent.\nIf, in proportion to the interest of money, the trade of the builders\naffords at any time much greater profit than this, it will soon draw so\nmuch capital from other trades as will reduce the profit to its proper\nlevel. If it affords at any time much less than this, other trades will\nsoon draw so much capital from it as will again raise that profit.\nWhatever part of the whole rent of a house is over and above what is\nsufficient for affording this reasonable profit, naturally goes to the\nground-rent; and, where the owner of the ground and the owner of the\nbuilding are two different persons, is, in most cases, completely paid to\nthe former. This surplus rent is the price which the inhabitant of the\nhouse pays for some real or supposed advantage of the situation. In\ncountry houses, at a distance from any great town, where there is plenty\nof ground to chuse upon, the ground-rent is scarce anything, or no more\nthan what the ground which the house stands upon would pay, if employed in\nagriculture. In country villas, in the neighbourhood of some great town,\nit is sometimes a good deal higher; and the peculiar conveniency or beauty\nof situation is there frequently very well paid for. Ground-rents are\ngenerally highest in the capital, and in those particular parts of it\nwhere there happens to be the greatest demand for houses, whatever be the\nreason of that demand, whether for trade and business, for pleasure and\nsociety, or for mere vanity and fashion.\nA tax upon house-rent, payable by the tenant, and proportioned to the\nwhole rent of each house, could not, for any considerable time at least,\naffect the building-rent. If the builder did not get his reasonable\nprofit, he would be obliged to quit the trade; which, by raising the\ndemand for building, would, in a short time, bring back his profit to its\nproper level with that of other trades. Neither would such a tax fall\naltogether upon the ground-rent; but it would divide itself in such a\nmanner, as to fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house, and partly\nupon the owner of the ground.\nLet us suppose, for example, that a particular person judges that he can\nafford for house-rent all expense of sixty pounds a-year; and let us\nsuppose, too, that a tax of four shillings in the pound, or of one-fifth,\npayable by the inhabitant, is laid upon house-rent. A house of sixty\npounds rent will, in that case, cost him seventy-two pounds a-year, which\nis twelve pounds more than he thinks he can afford. He will, therefore,\ncontent himself with a worse house, or a house of fifty pounds rent,\nwhich, with the additional ten pounds that he must pay for the tax, will\nmake up the sum of sixty pounds a-year, the expense which he judges he can\nafford, and, in order to pay the tax, he will give up a part of the\nadditional conveniency which he might have had from a house of ten pounds\na-year more rent. He will give up, I say, a part of this additional\nconveniency; for he will seldom be obliged to give up the whole, but will,\nin consequence of the tax, get a better house for fifty pounds a-year,\nthan he could have got if there had been no tax for as a tax of this kind,\nby taking away this particular competitor, must diminish the competition\nfor houses of sixty pounds rent, so it must likewise diminish it for those\nof fifty pounds rent, and in the same manner for those of all other rents,\nexcept the lowest rent, for which it would for some time increase the\ncompetition. But the rents of every class of houses for which the\ncompetition was diminished, would necessarily be more or less reduced. As\nno part of this reduction, however, could for any considerable time at\nleast, affect the building-rent, the whole of it must, in the long-run,\nnecessarily fall upon the ground-rent. The final payment of this tax,\ntherefore, would fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house, who, in\norder to pay his share, would be obliged to give up a part of his\nconveniency; and partly upon the owner of the ground, who, in order to pay\nhis share, would be obliged to give up a part of his revenue. In what\nproportion this final payment would be divided between them, it is not,\nperhaps, very easy to ascertain. The division would probably be very\ndifferent in different circumstances, and a tax of this kind might,\naccording to those different circumstances, affect very unequally, both\nthe inhabitant of the house and the owner of the ground.\nThe inequality with which a tax of this kind might fall upon the owners of\ndifferent ground-rents, would arise altogether from the accidental\ninequality of this division. But the inequality with which it might fall\nupon the inhabitants of different houses, would arise, not only from this,\nbut from another cause. The proportion of the expense of house-rent to the\nwhole expense of living, is different in the different degrees of fortune.\nIt is, perhaps, highest in the highest degree, and it diminishes gradually\nthrough the inferior degrees, so as in general to be lowest in the lowest\ndegree. The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor.\nThey find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little\nrevenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion\nthe principal expense of the rich; and a magnificent house embellishes and\nsets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which\nthey possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall\nheaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not,\nperhaps, be any thing very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that\nthe rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion\nto their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.\nThe rent of houses, though it in some respects resembles the rent of land,\nis in one respect essentially different from it. The rent of land is paid\nfor the use of a productive subject. The land which pays it produces it.\nThe rent of houses is paid for the use of an unproductive subject. Neither\nthe house, nor the ground which it stands upon, produce anything. The\nperson who pays the rent, therefore, must draw it from some other source\nof revenue, distinct from and independent of this subject. A tax upon the\nrent of houses, so far as it falls upon the inhabitants, must be drawn\nfrom the same source as the rent itself, and must be paid from their\nrevenue, whether derived from the wages of labour, the profits of stock,\nor the rent of land. So far as it falls upon the inhabitants, it is one of\nthose taxes which fall, not upon one only, but indifferently upon all the\nthree different sources of revenue; and is, in every respect, of the same\nnature as a tax upon any other sort of consumable commodities. In general,\nthere is not perhaps, any one article of expense or consumption by which\nthe liberality or narrowness of a man\u2019s whole expense can be better judged\nof than by his house-rent. A proportional tax upon this particular article\nof expense might, perhaps, produce a more considerable revenue than any\nwhich has hitherto been drawn from it in any part of Europe. If the tax,\nindeed, was very high, the greater part of people would endeavour to evade\nit as much as they could, by contenting themselves with smaller houses,\nand by turning the greater part of their expense into some other channel.\nThe rent of houses might easily be ascertained with sufficient accuracy,\nby a policy of the same kind with that which would be necessary for\nascertaining the ordinary rent of land. Houses not inhabited ought to pay\nno tax. A tax upon them would fall altogether upon the proprietor, who\nwould thus be taxed for a subject which afforded him neither conveniency\nnor revenue. Houses inhabited by the proprietor ought to be rated, not\naccording to the expense which they might have cost in building, but\naccording to the rent which an equitable arbitration might judge them\nlikely to bring if leased to a tenant. If rated according to the expense\nwhich they might have cost in building, a tax of three or four shillings\nin the pound, joined with other taxes, would ruin almost all the rich and\ngreat families of this, and, I believe, of every other civilized country.\nWhoever will examine with attention the different town and country houses\nof some of the richest and greatest families in this country, will find\nthat, at the rate of only six and a-half, or seven per cent. upon the\noriginal expense of building, their house-rent is nearly equal to the\nwhole neat rent of their estates. It is the accumulated expense of several\nsuccessive generations, laid out upon objects of great beauty and\nmagnificence, indeed, but, in proportion to what they cost, of very small\nexchangeable value. {Since the first publication of this book, a tax\nnearly upon the above-mentioned principles has been imposed.}\nGround-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of\nhouses. A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rent of houses; it\nwould fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always\nas a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use\nof his ground. More or less can be got for it, according as the\ncompetitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their\nfancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expense. In\nevery country, the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital,\nand it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be\nfound. As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased\nby a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be disposed to pay\nmore for the use of the ground. Whether the tax was to be advanced by the\ninhabitant or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance.\nThe more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the less he would\nincline to pay for the ground; so that the final payment of the tax would\nfall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent. The ground-rents of\nuninhabited houses ought to pay no tax. Both ground-rents, and the\nordinary rent of land, are a species of revenue which the owner, in many\ncases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of\nthis revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of\nthe state, no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of\nindustry. The annual produce of the land and labour of the society, the\nreal wealth and revenue of the great body of the people, might be the same\nafter such a tax as before. Ground-rents, and the ordinary rent of land,\nare therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can best bear to have\na peculiar tax imposed upon them.\nGround-rents seem, in this respect, a more proper subject of peculiar\ntaxation, than even the ordinary rent of land. The ordinary rent of land\nis, in many cases, owing partly, at least, to the attention and good\nmanagement of the landlord. A very heavy tax might discourage, too much,\nthis attention and good management. Ground-rents, so far as they exceed\nthe ordinary rent of land, are altogether owing to the good government of\nthe sovereign, which, by protecting the industry either of the whole\npeople or of the inhabitants of some particular place, enables them to pay\nso much more than its real value for the ground which they build their\nhouses upon; or to make to its owner so much more than compensation for\nthe loss which he might sustain by this use of it. Nothing can be more\nreasonable, than that a fund, which owes its existence to the good\ngovernment of the state, should be taxed peculiarly, or should contribute\nsomething more than the greater part of other funds, towards the support\nof that government.\nThough, in many different countries of Europe, taxes have been imposed\nupon the rent of houses, I do not know of any in which ground-rents have\nbeen considered as a separate subject of taxation. The contrivers of taxes\nhave, probably, found some difficulty in ascertaining what part of the\nrent ought to be considered as ground-rent, and what part ought to be\nconsidered as building-rent. It should not, however, seem very difficult\nto distinguish those two parts of the rent from one another.\nIn Great Britain the rent of houses is supposed to be taxed in the same\nproportion as the rent of land, by what is called the annual land tax. The\nvaluation, according to which each different parish and district is\nassessed to this tax, is always the same. It was originally extremely\nunequal, and it still continues to be so. Through the greater part of the\nkingdom this tax falls still more lightly upon the rent of houses than\nupon that of land. In some few districts only, which were originally rated\nhigh, and in which the rents of houses have fallen considerably, the land\ntax of three or four shillings in the pound is said to amount to an equal\nproportion of the real rent of houses. Untenanted houses, though by law\nsubject to the tax, are, in most districts, exempted from it by the favour\nof the assessors; and this exemption sometimes occasions some little\nvariation in the rate of particular houses, though that of the district is\nalways the same. Improvements of rent, by new buildings, repairs, etc. go\nto the discharge of the district, which occasions still further variations\nin the rate of particular houses.\nIn the province of Holland, {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. p. 223.}\nevery house is taxed at two and a-half per cent. of its value, without any\nregard, either to the rent which it actually pays, or to the circumstance\nof its being tenanted or untenanted. There seems to be a hardship in\nobliging the proprietor to pay a tax for an untenanted house, from which\nhe can derive no revenue, especially so very heavy a tax. In Holland,\nwhere the market rate of interest does not exceed three per cent., two and\na-half per cent. upon the whole value of the house must, in most cases,\namount to more than a third of the building-rent, perhaps of the whole\nrent. The valuation, indeed, according to which the houses are rated,\nthough very unequal, is said to be always below the real value. When a\nhouse is rebuilt, improved, or enlarged, there is a new valuation, and the\ntax is rated accordingly.\nThe contrivers of the several taxes which in England have, at different\ntimes, been imposed upon houses, seem to have imagined that there was some\ngreat difficulty in ascertaining, with tolerable exactness, what was the\nreal rent of every house. They have regulated their taxes, therefore,\naccording to some more obvious circumstance, such as they had probably\nimagined would, in most cases, bear some proportion to the rent.\nThe first tax of this kind was hearth-money; or a tax of two shillings\nupon every hearth. In order to ascertain how many hearths were in the\nhouse, it was necessary that the tax-gatherer should enter every room in\nit. This odious visit rendered the tax odious. Soon after the Revolution,\ntherefore, it was abolished as a badge of slavery.\nThe next tax of this kind was a tax of two shillings upon every\ndwelling-house inhabited. A house with ten windows to pay four shillings\nmore. A house with twenty windows and upwards to pay eight shillings. This\ntax was afterwards so far altered, that houses with twenty windows, and\nwith less than thirty, were ordered to pay ten shillings, and those with\nthirty windows and upwards to pay twenty shillings. The number of windows\ncan, in most cases, be counted from the outside, and, in all cases,\nwithout entering every room in the house. The visit of the tax-gatherer,\ntherefore, was less offensive in this tax than in the hearth-money.\nThis tax was afterwards repealed, and in the room of it was established\nthe window-tax, which has undergone two several alterations and\naugmentations. The window tax, as it stands at present (January 1775),\nover and above the duty of three shillings upon every house in England,\nand of one shilling upon every house in Scotland, lays a duty upon every\nwindow, which in England augments gradually from twopence, the lowest rate\nupon houses with not more than seven windows, to two shillings, the\nhighest rate upon houses with twenty-five windows and upwards.\nThe principal objection to all such taxes is their inequality; an\ninequality of the worst kind, as they must frequently fall much heavier\nupon the poor than upon the rich. A house of ten pounds rent in a country\ntown, may sometimes have more windows than a house of five hundred pounds\nrent in London; and though the inhabitant of the former is likely to be a\nmuch poorer man than that of the latter, yet, so far as his contribution\nis regulated by the window tax, he must contribute more to the support of\nthe state. Such taxes are, therefore, directly contrary to the first of\nthe four maxims above mentioned. They do not seem to offend much against\nany of the other three.\nThe natural tendency of the window tax, and of all other taxes upon\nhouses, is to lower rents. The more a man pays for the tax, the less, it\nis evident, he can afford to pay for the rent. Since the imposition of the\nwindow tax, however, the rents of houses have, upon the whole, risen more\nor less, in almost every town and village of Great Britain, with which I\nam acquainted. Such has been, almost everywhere, the increase of the\ndemand for houses, that it has raised the rents more than the window tax\ncould sink them; one of the many proofs of the great prosperity of the\ncountry, and of the increasing revenue of its inhabitants. Had it not been\nfor the tax, rents would probably have risen still higher.\nARTICLE II.\u2014Taxes upon Profit, or upon the Revenue arising from\nStock.\nThe revenue or profit arising from stock naturally divides itself into two\nparts; that which pays the interest, and which belongs to the owner of the\nstock; and that surplus part which is over and above what is necessary for\npaying the interest.\nThis latter part of profit is evidently a subject not taxable directly. It\nis the compensation, and, in most cases, it is no more than a very\nmoderate compensation for the risk and trouble of employing the stock. The\nemployer must have this compensation, otherwise he cannot, consistently\nwith his own interest, continue the employment. If he was taxed directly,\ntherefore, in proportion to the whole profit, he would be obliged either\nto raise the rate of his profit, or to charge the tax upon the interest of\nmoney; that is, to pay less interest. If he raised the rate of his profit\nin proportion to the tax, the whole tax, though it might be advanced by\nhim, would be finally paid by one or other of two different sets of\npeople, according to the different ways in which he might employ the stock\nof which he had the management. If he employed it as a farming stock, in\nthe cultivation of land, he could raise the rate of his profit only by\nretaining a greater portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price\nof a greater portion, of the produce of the land; and as this could be\ndone only by a reduction of rent, the final payment of the tax would fall\nupon the landlord. If he employed it as a mercantile or manufacturing\nstock, he could raise the rate of his profit only by raising the price of\nhis goods; in which case, the final payment of the tax would fall\naltogether upon the consumers of those goods. If he did not raise the rate\nof his profit, he would be obliged to charge the whole tax upon that part\nof it which was allotted for the interest of money. He could afford less\ninterest for whatever stock he borrowed, and the whole weight of the tax\nwould, in this case, fall ultimately upon the interest of money. So far as\nhe could not relieve himself from the tax in the one way, he would be\nobliged to relieve himself in the other.\nThe interest of money seems, at first sight, a subject equally capable of\nbeing taxed directly as the rent of land. Like the rent of land, it is a\nneat produce, which remains, after completely compensating the whole risk\nand trouble of employing the stock. As a tax upon the rent of land cannot\nraise rents, because the neat produce which remains, after replacing the\nstock of the farmer, together with his reasonable profit, cannot be\ngreater after the tax than before it, so, for the same reason, a tax upon\nthe interest of money could not raise the rate of interest; the quantity\nof stock or money in the country, like the quantity of land, being\nsupposed to remain the same after the tax as before it. The ordinary rate\nof profit, it has been shewn, in the first book, is everywhere regulated\nby the quantity of stock to be employed, in proportion to the quantity of\nthe employment, or of the business which must be done by it. But the\nquantity of the employment, or of the business to be done by stock, could\nneither be increased nor diminished by any tax upon the interest of money.\nIf the quantity of the stock to be employed, therefore, was neither\nincreased nor diminished by it, the ordinary rate of profit would\nnecessarily remain the same. But the portion of this profit, necessary for\ncompensating the risk and trouble of the employer, would likewise remain\nthe same; that risk and trouble being in no respect altered. The residue,\ntherefore, that portion which belongs to the owner of the stock, and which\npays the interest of money, would necessarily remain the same too. At\nfirst sight, therefore, the interest of money seems to be a subject as fit\nto be taxed directly as the rent of land.\nThere are, however, two different circumstances, which render the interest\nof money a much less proper subject of direct taxation than the rent of\nland.\nFirst, the quantity and value of the land which any man possesses, can\nnever be a secret, and can always be ascertained with great exactness. But\nthe whole amount of the capital stock which he possesses is almost always\na secret, and can scarce ever be ascertained with tolerable exactness. It\nis liable, besides, to almost continual variations. A year seldom passes\naway, frequently not a month, sometimes scarce a single day, in which it\ndoes not rise or fall more or less. An inquisition into every man\u2019s\nprivate circumstances, and an inquisition which, in order to accommodate\nthe tax to them, watched over all the fluctuations of his fortune, would\nbe a source of such continual and endless vexation as no person could\nsupport.\nSecondly, land is a subject which cannot be removed; whereas stock easily\nmay. The proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen of the particular\ncountry in which his estate lies. The proprietor of stock is properly a\ncitizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular\ncountry. He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to\na vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax; and\nwould remove his stock to some other country, where he could either carry\non his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease. By removing his\nstock, he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in\nthe country which he left. Stock cultivates land; stock employs labour. A\ntax which tended to drive away stock from any particular country, would so\nfar tend to dry up every source of revenue, both to the sovereign and to\nthe society. Not only the profits of stock, but the rent of land, and the\nwages of labour, would necessarily be more or less diminished by its\nremoval.\nThe nations, accordingly, who have attempted to tax the revenue arising\nfrom stock, instead of any severe inquisition of this kind, have been\nobliged to content themselves with some very loose, and, therefore, more\nor less arbitrary estimation. The extreme inequality and uncertainty of a\ntax assessed in this manner, can be compensated only by its extreme\nmoderation; in consequence of which, every man finds himself rated so very\nmuch below his real revenue, that he gives himself little disturbance\nthough his neighbour should be rated somewhat lower.\nBy what is called the land tax in England, it was intended that the stock\nshould be taxed in the same proportion as land. When the tax upon land was\nat four shillings in the pound, or at one-fifth of the supposed rent, it\nwas intended that stock should be taxed at one-fifth of the supposed\ninterest. When the present annual land tax was first imposed, the legal\nrate of interest was six per cent. Every hundred pounds stock,\naccordingly, was supposed to be taxed at twenty-four shillings, the fifth\npart of six pounds. Since the legal rate of interest has been reduced to\nfive per cent. every hundred pounds stock is supposed to be taxed at\ntwenty shillings only. The sum to be raised, by what is called the land\ntax, was divided between the country and the principal towns. The greater\npart of it was laid upon the country; and of what was laid upon the towns,\nthe greater part was assessed upon the houses. What remained to be\nassessed upon the stock or trade of the towns (for the stock upon the land\nwas not meant to be taxed) was very much below the real value of that\nstock or trade. Whatever inequalities, therefore, there might be in the\noriginal assessment, gave little disturbance. Every parish and district\nstill continues to be rated for its land, its houses, and its stock,\naccording to the original assessment; and the almost universal prosperity\nof the country, which, in most places, has raised very much the value of\nall these, has rendered those inequalities of still less importance now.\nThe rate, too, upon each district, continuing always the same, the\nuncertainty of this tax, so far as it might he assessed upon the stock of\nany individual, has been very much diminished, as well as rendered of much\nless consequence. If the greater part of the lands of England are not\nrated to the land tax at half their actual value, the greater part of the\nstock of England is, perhaps, scarce rated at the fiftieth part of its\nactual value. In some towns, the whole land tax is assessed upon houses;\nas in Westminster, where stock and trade are free. It is otherwise in\nLondon.\nIn all countries, a severe inquisition into the circumstances of private\npersons has been carefully avoided.\nAt Hamburg, {Memoires concernant les Droits, tom. i, p.74} every\ninhabitant is obliged to pay to the state one fourth per cent. of all that\nhe possesses; and as the wealth of the people of Hamburg consists\nprincipally in stock, this tax maybe considered as a tax upon stock. Every\nman assesses himself, and, in the presence of the magistrate, puts\nannually into the public coffer a certain sum of money, which he declares\nupon oath, to be one fourth per cent. of all that he possesses, but\nwithout declaring what it amounts to, or being liable to any examination\nupon that subject. This tax is generally supposed to be paid with great\nfidelity. In a small republic, where the people have entire confidence in\ntheir magistrates, are convinced of the necessity of the tax for the\nsupport of the state, and believe that it will be faithfully applied to\nthat purpose, such conscientious and voluntary payment may sometimes be\nexpected. It is not peculiar to the people of Hamburg.\nThe canton of Underwald, in Switzerland, is frequently ravaged by storms\nand inundations, and it is thereby exposed to extraordinary expenses. Upon\nsuch occasions the people assemble, and every one is said to declare with\nthe greatest frankness what he is worth, in order to be taxed accordingly.\nAt Zurich, the law orders, that in cases of necessity, every one should be\ntaxed in proportion to his revenue; the amount of which he is obliged to\ndeclare upon oath. They have no suspicion, it is said, that any of their\nfellow citizens will deceive them. At Basil, the principal revenue of the\nstate arises from a small custom upon goods exported. All the citizens\nmake oath, that they will pay every three months all the taxes imposed by\nlaw. All merchants, and even all inn-keepers, are trusted with keeping\nthemselves the account of the goods which they sell, either within or\nwithout the territory. At the end of every three months, they send this\naccount to the treasurer, with the amount of the tax computed at the\nbottom of it. It is not suspected that the revenue suffers by this\nconfidence. {Memoires concernant les Droits, tom. i p. 163, 167,171.}\nTo oblige every citizen to declare publicly upon oath, the amount of his\nfortune, must not, it seems, in those Swiss cantons, be reckoned a\nhardship. At Hamburg it would be reckoned the greatest. Merchants engaged\nin the hazardous projects of trade, all tremble at the thoughts of being\nobliged, at all times, to expose the real state of their circumstances.\nThe ruin of their credit, and the miscarriage of their projects, they\nforesee, would too often be the consequence. A sober and parsimonious\npeople, who are strangers to all such projects, do not feel that they have\noccasion for any such concealment.\nIn Holland, soon after the exaltation of the late prince of Orange to the\nstadtholdership, a tax of two per cent. or the fiftieth penny, as it was\ncalled, was imposed upon the whole substance of every citizen. Every\ncitizen assesed himself, and paid his tax, in the same manner as at\nHamburg, and it was in general supposed to have been paid with great\nfidelity. The people had at that time the greatest affection for their new\ngovernment, which they had just established by a general insurrection. The\ntax was to be paid but once, in order to relieve the state in a particular\nexigency. It was, indeed, too heavy to be permanent. In a country where\nthe market rate of interest seldom exceeds three per cent., a tax of two\nper cent. amounts to thirteen shillings and four pence in the pound, upon\nthe highest neat revenue which is commonly drawn from stock. It is a tax\nwhich very few people could pay, without encroaching more or less upon\ntheir capitals. In a particular exigency, the people may, from great\npublic zeal, make a great effort, and give up even a part of their\ncapital, in order to relieve the state. But it is impossible that they\nshould continue to do so for any considerable time; and if they did, the\ntax would soon ruin them so completely, as to render them altogether\nincapable of supporting the state.\nThe tax upon stock, imposed by the land tax bill in England, though it is\nproportioned to the capital, is not intended to diminish or, take away any\npart of that capital. It is meant only to be a tax upon the interest of\nmoney, proportioned to that upon the rent of land; so that when the latter\nis at four shillings in the pound, the former may be at four shillings in\nthe pound too. The tax at Hamburg, and the still more moderate taxes of\nUnderwald and Zurich, are meant, in the same manner, to be taxes, not upon\nthe capital, but upon the interest or neat revenue of stock. That of\nHolland was meant to be a tax upon the capital.\nTaxes upon the Profit of particular Employments.\nIn some countries, extraordinary taxes are imposed upon the profits of\nstock; sometimes when employed in particular branches of trade, and\nsometimes when employed in agriculture.\nOf the former kind, are in England, the tax upon hawkers and pedlars, that\nupon hackney-coaches and chairs, and that which the keepers of ale-houses\npay for a licence to retail ale and spiritous liquors. During the late\nwar, another tax of the same kind was proposed upon shops. The war having\nbeen undertaken, it was said, in defence of the trade of the country, the\nmerchants, who were to profit by it, ought to contribute towards the\nsupport of it.\nA tax, however, upon the profits of stock employed in any particular\nbranch of trade, can never fall finally upon the dealers (who must in all\nordinary cases have their reasonable profit, and, where the competition is\nfree, can seldom have more than that profit), but always upon the\nconsumers, who must be obliged to pay in the price of the goods the tax\nwhich the dealer advances; and generally with some overcharge.\nA tax of this kind, when it is proportioned to the trade of the dealer, is\nfinally paid by the consumer, and occasions no oppression to the dealer.\nWhen it is not so proportioned, but is the same upon all dealers, though\nin this case, too, it is finally paid by the consumer, yet it favours the\ngreat, and occasions some oppression to the small dealer. The tax of five\nshillings a-week upon every hackney coach, and that of ten shillings\na-year upon every hackney chair, so far as it is advanced by the different\nkeepers of such coaches and chairs, is exactly enough proportioned to the\nextent of their respective dealings. It neither favours the great, nor\noppresses the smaller dealer. The tax of twenty shillings a-year for a\nlicence to sell ale; of forty shillings for a licence to sell spiritous\nliquors; and of forty shillings more for a licence to sell wine, being the\nsame upon all retailers, must necessarily give some advantage to the\ngreat, and occasion some oppression to the small dealers. The former must\nfind it more easy to get back the tax in the price of their goods than the\nlatter. The moderation of the tax, however, renders this inequality of\nless importance; and it may to many people appear not improper to give\nsome discouragement to the multiplication of little ale-houses. The tax\nupon shops, it was intended, should be the same upon all shops. It could\nnot well have been otherwise. It would have been impossible to proportion,\nwith tolerable exactness, the tax upon a shop to the extent of the trade\ncarried on in it, without such an inquisition as would have been\naltogether insupportable in a free country. If the tax had been\nconsiderable, it would have oppressed the small, and forced almost the\nwhole retail trade into the hands of the great dealers. The competition of\nthe former being taken away, the latter would have enjoyed a monopoly of\nthe trade; and, like all other monopolists, would soon have combined to\nraise their profits much beyond what was necessary for the payment of the\ntax. The final payment, instead of falling upon the shop-keeper, would\nhave fallen upon the consumer, with a considerable overcharge to the\nprofit of the shop-keeper. For these reasons, the project of a tax upon\nshops was laid aside, and in the room of it was substituted the subsidy,\n1759.\nWhat in France is called the personal taille, is perhaps, the most\nimportant tax upon the profits of stock employed in agriculture, that is\nlevied in any part of Europe.\nIn the disorderly state of Europe, during the prevalence of the feudal\ngovernment, the sovereign was obliged to content himself with taxing those\nwho were too weak to refuse to pay taxes. The great lords, though willing\nto assist him upon particular emergencies, refused to subject themselves\nto any constant tax, and he was not strong enough to force them. The\noccupiers of land all over Europe were, the greater part of them,\noriginally bond-men. Through the greater part of Europe, they were\ngradually emancipated. Some of them acquired the property of landed\nestates, which they held by some base or ignoble tenure, sometimes under\nthe king, and sometimes under some other great lord, like the ancient\ncopy-holders of England. Others, without acquiring the property, obtained\nleases for terms of years, of the lands which they occupied under their\nlord, and thus became less dependent upon him. The great lords seem to\nhave beheld the degree of prosperity and independency, which this inferior\norder of men had thus come to enjoy, with a malignant and contemptuous\nindignation, and willingly consented that the sovereign should tax them.\nIn some countries, this tax was confined to the lands which were held in\nproperty by an ignoble tenure; and, in this case, the taille was said to\nbe real. The land tax established by the late king of Sardinia, and the\ntaille in the provinces of Languedoc, Provence, Dauphine, and Britanny; in\nthe generality of Montauban, and in the elections of Agen and Condom, as\nwell as in some other districts of France; are taxes upon lands held in\nproperty by an ignoble tenure. In other countries, the tax was laid upon\nthe supposed profits of all those who held, in farm or lease, lands\nbelonging to other people, whatever might be the tenure by which the\nproprietor held them; and in this case, the taille was said to be\npersonal. In the greater part of those provinces of France, which are\ncalled the countries of elections, the taille is of this kind. The real\ntaille, as it is imposed only upon a part of the lands of the country, is\nnecessarily an unequal, but it is not always an arbitrary tax, though it\nis so upon some occasions. The personal taille, as it is intended to be\nproportioned to the profits of a certain class of people, which can only\nbe guessed at, is necessarily both arbitrary and unequal.\nIn France, the personal taille at present (1775) annually imposed upon the\ntwenty generalities, called the countries of elections, amounts to\n40,107,239 livres, 16 sous. {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc tom. ii,\np.17.} the proportion in which this sum is assessed upon those different\nprovinces, varies from year to year, according to the reports which are\nmade to the king\u2019s council concerning the goodness or badness of the\ncrops, as well as other circumstances, which may either increase or\ndiminish their respective abilities to pay. Each generality is divided\ninto a certain number of elections; and the proportion in which the sum\nimposed upon the whole generality is divided among those different\nelections, varies likewise from year to year, according to the reports\nmade to the council concerning their respective abilities. It seems\nimpossible, that the council, with the best intentions, can ever\nproportion, with tolerable exactness, either of these two assessments to\nthe real abilities of the province or district upon which they are\nrespectively laid. Ignorance and misinformation must always, more or less,\nmislead the most upright council. The proportion which each parish ought\nto support of what is assessed upon the whole election, and that which\neach individual ought to support of what is assessed upon his particular\nparish, are both in the same manner varied from year to year, according as\ncircumstances are supposed to require. These circumstances are judged of,\nin the one case, by the officers of the election, in the other, by those\nof the parish; and both the one and the other are, more or less, under the\ndirection and influence of the intendant. Not only ignorance and\nmisinformation, but friendship, party animosity, and private resentment,\nare said frequently to mislead such assessors. No man subject to such a\ntax, it is evident, can ever be certain, before he is assessed, of what he\nis to pay. He cannot even be certain after he is assessed. If any person\nhas been taxed who ought to have been exempted, or if any person has been\ntaxed beyond his proportion, though both must pay in the mean time, yet if\nthey complain, and make good their complaints, the whole parish is\nreimposed next year, in order to reimburse them. If any of the\ncontributors become bankrupt or insolvent, the collector is obliged to\nadvance his tax; and the whole parish is reimposed next year, in order to\nreimburse the collector. If the collector himself should become bankrupt,\nthe parish which elects him must answer for his conduct to the\nreceiver-general of the election. But, as it might be troublesome for the\nreceiver to prosecute the whole parish, he takes at his choice five or six\nof the richest contributors, and obliges them to make good what had been\nlost by the insolvency of the collector. The parish is afterwards\nreimposed, in order to reimburse those five or six. Such reimpositions are\nalways over and above the taille of the particular year in which they are\nlaid on.\nWhen a tax is imposed upon the profits of stock in a particular branch of\ntrade, the traders are all careful to bring no more goods to market than\nwhat they can sell at a price sufficient to reimburse them from advancing\nthe tax. Some of them withdraw a part of their stocks from the trade, and\nthe market is more sparingly supplied than before. The price of the goods\nrises, and the final payment of the tax falls upon the consumer. But when\na tax is imposed upon the profits of stock employed in agriculture, it is\nnot the interest of the farmers to withdraw any part of their stock from\nthat employment. Each farmer occupies a certain quantity of land, for\nwhich he pays rent. For the proper cultivation of this land, a certain\nquantity of stock is necessary; and by withdrawing any part of this\nnecessary quantity, the farmer is not likely to be more able to pay either\nthe rent or the tax. In order to pay the tax, it can never be his interest\nto diminish the quantity of his produce, nor consequently to supply the\nmarket more sparingly than before. The tax, therefore, will never enable\nhim to raise the price of his produce, so as to reimburse himself, by\nthrowing the final payment upon the consumer. The farmer, however, must\nhave his reasonable profit as well as every other dealer, otherwise he\nmust give up the trade. After the imposition of a tax of this kind, he can\nget this reasonable profit only by paying less rent to the landlord. The\nmore he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the less he can afford to pay\nin the way of rent. A tax of this kind, imposed during the currency of a\nlease, may, no doubt, distress or ruin the farmer. Upon the renewal of the\nlease, it must always fall upon the landlord.\nIn the countries where the personal taille takes place, the farmer is\ncommonly assessed in proportion to the stock which he appears to employ in\ncultivation. He is, upon this account, frequently afraid to have a good\nteam of horses or oxen, but endeavours to cultivate with the meanest and\nmost wretched instruments of husbandry that he can. Such is his distrust\nin the justice of his assessors, that he counterfeits poverty, and wishes\nto appear scarce able to pay anything, for fear of being obliged to pay\ntoo much. By this miserable policy, he does not, perhaps, always consult\nhis own interest in the most effectual manner; and he probably loses more\nby the diminution of his produce, than he saves by that of his tax.\nThough, in consequence of this wretched cultivation, the market is, no\ndoubt, somewhat worse supplied; yet the small rise of price which this may\noccasion, as it is not likely even to indemnify the farmer for the\ndiminution of his produce, it is still less likely to enable him to pay\nmore rent to the landlord. The public, the farmer, the landlord, all\nsuffer more or less by this degraded cultivation. That the personal taille\ntends, in many different ways, to discourage cultivation, and consequently\nto dry up the principal source of the wealth of every great country, I\nhave already had occasion to observe in the third book of this Inquiry.\nWhat are called poll-taxes in the southern provinces of North America, and\nthe West India islands, annual taxes of so much a-head upon every negro,\nare properly taxes upon the profits of a certain species of stock employed\nin agriculture. As the planters, are the greater part of them, both\nfarmers and landlords, the final payment of the tax falls upon them in\ntheir quality of landlords, without any retribution.\nTaxes of so much a head upon the bondmen employed in cultivation, seem\nanciently to have been common all over Europe. There subsists at present a\ntax of this kind in the empire of Russia. It is probably upon this account\nthat poll-taxes of all kinds have often been represented as badges of\nslavery. Every tax, however, is, to the person who pays it, a badge, not\nof slavery, but of liberty. It denotes that he is subject to government,\nindeed; but that, as he has some property, he cannot himself be the\nproperty of a master. A poll tax upon slaves is altogether different from\na poll-tax upon freemen. The latter is paid by the persons upon whom it is\nimposed; the former, by a different set of persons. The latter is either\naltogether arbitrary, or altogether unequal, and, in most cases, is both\nthe one and the other; the former, though in some respects unequal,\ndifferent slaves being of different values, is in no respect arbitrary.\nEvery master, who knows the number of his own slaves, knows exactly what\nhe has to pay. Those different taxes, however, being called by the same\nname, have been considered as of the same nature.\nThe taxes which in Holland are imposed upon men and maid servants, are\ntaxes, not upon stock, but upon expense; and so far resemble the taxes\nupon consumable commodities. The tax of a guinea a-head for every\nman-servant, which has lately been imposed in Great Britain, is of the\nsame kind. It falls heaviest upon the middling rank. A man of two hundred\na-year may keep a single man-servant. A man of ten thousand a-year will\nnot keep fifty. It does not affect the poor.\nTaxes upon the profits of stock, in particular employments, can never\naffect the interest of money. Nobody will lend his money for less interest\nto those who exercise the taxed, than to those who exercise the untaxed\nemployments. Taxes upon the revenue arising from stock in all employments,\nwhere the government attempts to levy them with any degree of exactness,\nwill, in many cases, fall upon the interest of money. The vingtieme, or\ntwentieth penny, in France, is a tax of the same kind with what is called\nthe land tax in England, and is assessed, in the same manner, upon the\nrevenue arising upon land, houses, and stock. So far as it affects stock,\nit is assessed, though not with great rigour, yet with much more exactness\nthan that part of the land tax in England which is imposed upon the same\nfund. It, in many cases, falls altogether upon the interest of money.\nMoney is frequently sunk in France, upon what are called contracts for the\nconstitution of a rent; that is, perpetual annuities, redeemable at any\ntime by the debtor, upon payment of the sum originally advanced, but of\nwhich this redemption is not exigible by the creditor except in particular\ncases. The vingtieme seems not to have raised the rate of those annuities,\nthough it is exactly levied upon them all.\nAPPENDIX TO ARTICLES I. AND II.\u2014Taxes upon the Capital Value of\nLands, Houses, and Stock.\nWhile property remains in the possession of the same person, whatever\npermanent taxes may have been imposed upon it, they have never been\nintended to diminish or take away any part of its capital value, but only\nsome part of the revenue arising from it. But when property changes hands,\nwhen it is transmitted either from the dead to the living, or from the\nliving to the living, such taxes have frequently been imposed upon it as\nnecessarily take away some part of its capital value.\nThe transference of all sorts of property from the dead to the living, and\nthat of immoveable property of land and houses from the living to the\nliving, are transactions which are in their nature either public and\nnotorious, or such as cannot be long concealed. Such transactions,\ntherefore, may be taxed directly. The transference of stock or moveable\nproperty, from the living to the living, by the lending of money, is\nfrequently a secret transaction, and may always be made so. It cannot\neasily, therefore, be taxed directly. It has been taxed indirectly in two\ndifferent ways; first, by requiring that the deed, containing the\nobligation to repay, should be written upon paper or parchment which had\npaid a certain stamp duty, otherwise not to be valid; secondly, by\nrequiring, under the like penalty of invalidity, that it should be\nrecorded either in a public or secret register, and by imposing certain\nduties upon such registration. Stamp duties, and duties of registration,\nhave frequently been imposed likewise upon the deeds transferring property\nof all kinds from the dead to the living, and upon those transferring\nimmoveable property from the living to the living; transactions which\nmight easily have been taxed directly.\nThe vicesima hereditatum, or the twentieth penny of inheritances, imposed\nby Augustus upon the ancient Romans, was a tax upon the transference of\nproperty from the dead to the living. Dion Cassius, { Lib. 55. See also\nBurman. de Vectigalibus Pop. Rom. cap. xi. and Bouchaud de l\u2019impot du\nvingtieme sur les successions.} the author who writes concerning it the\nleast indistinctly, says, that it was imposed upon all successions,\nlegacies and donations, in case of death, except upon those to the nearest\nrelations, and to the poor.\nOf the same kind is the Dutch tax upon successions. {See Memoires\nconcernant les Droits, etc. tom i, p. 225.} Collateral successions are\ntaxed according to the degree of relation, from five to thirty per cent.\nupon the whole value of the succession. Testamentary donations, or\nlegacies to collaterals, are subject to the like duties. Those from\nhusband to wife, or from wife to husband, to the fiftieth penny. The\nluctuosa hereditas, the mournful succession of ascendants to descendants,\nto the twentieth penny only. Direct successions, or those of descendants\nto ascendants, pay no tax. The death of a father, to such of his children\nas live in the same house with him, is seldom attended with any increase,\nand frequently with a considerable diminution of revenue; by the loss of\nhis industry, of his office, or of some life-rent estate, of which he may\nhave been in possession. That tax would be cruel and oppressive, which\naggravated their loss, by taking from them any part of his succession. It\nmay, however, sometimes be otherwise with those children, who, in the\nlanguage of the Roman law, are said to be emancipated; in that of the\nScotch law, to be foris-familiated; that is, who have received their\nportion, have got families of their own, and are supported by funds\nseparate and independent of those of their father. Whatever part of his\nsuccession might come to such children, would be a real addition to their\nfortune, and might, therefore, perhaps, without more inconveniency than\nwhat attends all duties of this kind, be liable to some tax. The\ncasualties of the feudal law were taxes upon the transference of land,\nboth from the dead to the living, and from the living to the living. In\nancient times, they constituted, in every part of Europe, one of the\nprincipal branches of the revenue of the crown.\nThe heir of every immediate vassal of the crown paid a certain duty,\ngenerally a year\u2019s rent, upon receiving the investiture of the estate. If\nthe heir was a minor, the whole rents of the estate, during the\ncontinuance of the minority, devolved to the superior, without any other\ncharge besides the maintenance of the minor, and the payment of the\nwidow\u2019s dower, when there happened to be a dowager upon the land. When the\nminor came to be of age, another tax, called relief, was still due to the\nsuperior, which generally amounted likewise to a year\u2019s rent. A long\nminority, which, in the present times, so frequently disburdens a great\nestate of all its incumbrances, and restores the family to their ancient\nsplendour, could in those times have no such effect. The waste, and not\nthe disincumbrance of the estate, was the common effect of a long\nminority.\nBy a feudal law, the vassal could not alienate without the consent of his\nsuperior, who generally extorted a fine or composition on granting it.\nThis fine, which was at first arbitrary, came, in many countries, to be\nregulated at a certain portion of the price of the land. In some\ncountries, where the greater part of the other feudal customs have gone\ninto disuse, this tax upon the alienation of land still continues to make\na very considerable branch of the revenue of the sovereign. In the canton\nof Berne it is so high as a sixth part of the price of all noble fiefs,\nand a tenth part of that of all ignoble ones. {Memoires concernant les\nDroits, etc, tom.i p.154} In the canton of Lucern, the tax upon the sale\nof land is not universal, and takes place only in certain districts. But\nif any person sells his land in order to remove out of the territory, he\npays ten per cent. upon the whole price of the sale. {id. p.157.} Taxes of\nthe same kind, upon the sale either of all lands, or of lands held by\ncertain tenures, take place in many other countries, and make a more or\nless considerable branch of the revenue of the sovereign.\nSuch transactions may be taxed indirectly, by means either of stamp\nduties, or of duties upon registration; and those duties either may, or\nmay not, be proportioned to the value of the subject which is transferred.\nIn Great Britain, the stamp duties are higher or lower, not so much\naccording to the value of the property transferred (an eighteen-penny or\nhalf-crown stamp being sufficient upon a bond for the largest sum of\nmoney), as according to the nature of the deed. The highest do not exceed\nsix pounds upon every sheet of paper, or skin of parchment; and these high\nduties fall chiefly upon grants from the crown, and upon certain law\nproceedings, without any regard to the value of the subject. There are, in\nGreat Britain, no duties on the registration of deeds or writings, except\nthe fees of the officers who keep the register; and these are seldom more\nthan a reasonable recompence for their labour. The crown derives no\nrevenue from them.\nIn Holland {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom. i. p 223, 224, 225.}\nthere are both stamp duties and duties upon registration; which in some\ncases are, and in some are not, proportioned to the value of the property\ntransferred. All testaments must be written upon stamped paper, of which\nthe price is proportioned to the property disposed of; so that there are\nstamps which cost from three pence or three stivers a-sheet, to three\nhundred florins, equal to about twenty-seven pounds ten shillings of our\nmoney. If the stamp is of an inferior price to what the testator ought to\nhave made use of, his succession is confiscated. This is over and above\nall their other taxes on succession. Except bills of exchange, and some\nother mercantile bills, all other deeds, bonds, and contracts, are subject\nto a stamp duty. This duty, however, does not rise in proportion to the\nvalue of the subject. All sales of land and of houses, and all mortgages\nupon either, must be registered, and, upon registration, pay a duty to the\nstate of two and a-half per cent. upon the amount of the price or of the\nmortgage. This duty is extended to the sale of all ships and vessels of\nmore than two tons burden, whether decked or undecked. These, it seems,\nare considered as a sort of houses upon the water. The sale of moveables,\nwhen it is ordered by a court of justice, is subject to the like duty of\ntwo and a-half per cent.\nIn France, there are both stamp duties and duties upon registration. The\nformer are considered as a branch of the aids of excise, and, in the\nprovinces where those duties take place, are levied by the excise\nofficers. The latter are considered as a branch of the domain of the crown\nand are levied by a different set of officers.\nThose modes of taxation by stamp duties and by duties upon registration,\nare of very modern invention. In the course of little more than a century,\nhowever, stamp duties have, in Europe, become almost universal, and duties\nupon registration extremely common. There is no art which one government\nsooner learns of another, than that of draining money from the pockets of\nthe people.\nTaxes upon the transference of property from the dead to the living, fall\nfinally, as well as immediately, upon the persons to whom the property is\ntransferred. Taxes upon the sale of land fall altogether upon the seller.\nThe seller is almost always under the necessity of selling, and must,\ntherefore, take such a price as he can get. The buyer is scarce ever under\nthe necessity of buying, and will, therefore, only give such a price as he\nlikes. He considers what the land will cost him, in tax and price\ntogether. The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the less he\nwill be disposed to give in the way of price. Such taxes, therefore, fall\nalmost always upon a necessitous person, and must, therefore, be\nfrequently very cruel and oppressive. Taxes upon the sale of new-built\nhouses, where the building is sold without the ground, fall generally upon\nthe buyer, because the builder must generally have his profit; otherwise\nhe must give up the trade. If he advances the tax, therefore, the buyer\nmust generally repay it to him. Taxes upon the sale of old houses, for the\nsame reason as those upon the sale of land, fall generally upon the\nseller; whom, in most cases, either conveniency or necessity obliges to\nsell. The number of new-built houses that are annually brought to market,\nis more or less regulated by the demand. Unless the demand is such as to\nafford the builder his profit, after paying all expenses, he will build no\nmore houses. The number of old houses which happen at any time to come to\nmarket, is regulated by accidents, of which the greater part have no\nrelation to the demand. Two or three great bankruptcies in a mercantile\ntown, will bring many houses to sale, which must be sold for what can be\ngot for them. Taxes upon the sale of ground-rents fall altogether upon the\nseller, for the same reason as those upon the sale of lands. Stamp duties,\nand duties upon the registration of bonds and contracts for borrowed\nmoney, fall altogether upon the borrower, and, in fact, are always paid by\nhim. Duties of the same kind upon law proceedings fall upon the suitors.\nThey reduce to both the capital value of the subject in dispute. The more\nit costs to acquire any property, the less must be the neat value of it\nwhen acquired.\nAll taxes upon the transference of property of every kind, so far as they\ndiminish the capital value of that property, tend to diminish the funds\ndestined for the maintenance of productive labour. They are all more or\nless unthrifty taxes that increase the revenue of the sovereign, which\nseldom maintains any but unproductive labourers, at the expense of the\ncapital of the people, which maintains none but productive.\nSuch taxes, even when they are proportioned to the value of the property\ntransferred, are still unequal; the frequency of transference not being\nalways equal in property of equal value. When they are not proportioned to\nthis value, which is the case with the greater part of the stamp duties\nand duties of registration, they are still more so. They are in no respect\narbitrary, but are, or may be, in all cases, perfectly clear and certain.\nThough they sometimes fall upon the person who is not very able to pay,\nthe time of payment is, in most cases, sufficiently convenient for him.\nWhen the payment becomes due, he must, in most cases, have the more to\npay. They are levied at very little expense, and in general subject the\ncontributors to no other inconveniency, besides always the unavoidable one\nof paying the tax. In France, the stamp duties are not much complained of.\nThose of registration, which they call the Controle, are. They give\noccasion, it is pretended, to much extortion in the officers of the\nfarmers-general who collect the tax, which is in a great measure arbitrary\nand uncertain. In the greater part of the libels which have been written\nagainst the present system of finances in France, the abuses of the\ncontrole make a principal article. Uncertainty, however, does not seem to\nbe necessarily inherent in the nature of such taxes. If the popular\ncomplaints are well founded, the abuse must arise, not so much from the\nnature of the tax as from the want of precision and distinctness in the\nwords of the edicts or laws which impose it.\nThe registration of mortgages, and in general of all rights upon\nimmoveable property, as it gives great security both to creditors and\npurchasers, is extremely advantageous to the public. That of the greater\npart of deeds of other kinds, is frequently inconvenient and even\ndangerous to individuals, without any advantage to the public. All\nregisters which, it is acknowledged, ought to be kept secret, ought\ncertainly never to exist. The credit of individuals ought certainly never\nto depend upon so very slender a security, as the probity and religion of\nthe inferior officers of revenue. But where the fees of registration have\nbeen made a source of revenue to the sovereign, register-offices have\ncommonly been multiplied without end, both for the deeds which ought to be\nregistered, and for those which ought not. In France there are several\ndifferent sorts of secret registers. This abuse, though not perhaps a\nnecessary, it must be acknowledged, is a very natural effect of such\ntaxes.\nSuch stamp duties as those in England upon cards and dice, upon newspapers\nand periodical pamphlets, etc. are properly taxes upon consumption; the\nfinal payment falls upon the persons who use or consume such commodities.\nSuch stamp duties as those upon licences to retail ale, wine, and\nspiritous liquors, though intended, perhaps, to fall upon the profits of\nthe retailers, are likewise finally paid by the consumers of those\nliquors. Such taxes, though called by the same name, and levied by the\nsame officers, and in the same manner with the stamp duties above\nmentioned upon the transference of property, are, however, of a quite\ndifferent nature, and fall upon quite different funds.\nARTICLE III.\u2014Taxes upon the Wages of Labour.\nThe wages of the inferior classes of work men, I have endeavoured to show\nin the first book are everywhere necessarily regulated by two different\ncircumstances; the demand for labour, and the ordinary or average price of\nprovisions. The demand for labour, according as it happens to be either\nincreasing, stationary, or declining; or to require an increasing,\nstationary, or declining population, regulates the subsistence of the\nlabourer, and determines in what degree it shall be either liberal,\nmoderate, or scanty. The ordinary average price of provisions determines\nthe quantity of money which must be paid to the workman, in order to\nenable him, one year with another, to purchase this liberal, moderate, or\nscanty subsistence. While the demand for the labour and the price of\nprovisions, therefore, remain the same, a direct tax upon the wages of\nlabour can have no other effect, than to raise them somewhat higher than\nthe tax. Let us suppose, for example, that, in a particular place, the\ndemand for labour and the price of provisions were such as to render ten\nshillings a-week the ordinary wages of labour; and that a tax of\none-fifth, or four shillings in the pound, was imposed upon wages. If the\ndemand for labour and the price of provisions remained the same, it would\nstill be necessary that the labourer should, in that place, earn such a\nsubsistence as could be bought only for ten shillings a-week; so that,\nafter paying the tax, he should have ten shillings a-week free wages. But,\nin order to leave him such free wages, after paying such a tax, the price\nof labour must, in that place, soon rise, not to twelve shillings a week\nonly, but to twelve and sixpence; that is, in order to enable him to pay a\ntax of one-fifth, his wages must necessarily soon rise, not one-fifth part\nonly, but one-fourth. Whatever was the proportion of the tax, the wages of\nlabour must, in all cases rise, not only in that proportion, but in a\nhigher proportion. If the tax for example, was one-tenth, the wages of\nlabour must necessarily soon rise, not one-tenth part only, but\none-eighth.\nA direct tax upon the wages of labour, therefore, though the labourer\nmight, perhaps, pay it out of his hand, could not properly be said to be\neven advanced by him; at least if the demand for labour and the average\nprice of provisions remained the same after the tax as before it. In all\nsuch cases, not only the tax, but something more than the tax, would in\nreality be advanced by the person who immediately employed him. The final\npayment would, in different cases, fall upon different persons. The rise\nwhich such a tax might occasion in the wages of manufacturing labour would\nbe advanced by the master manufacturer, who would both be entitled and\nobliged to charge it, with a profit, upon the price of his goods. The\nfinal payment of this rise of wages, therefore, together with the\nadditional profit of the master manufacturer would fall upon the consumer.\nThe rise which such a tax might occasion in the wages of country labour\nwould be advanced by the farmer, who, in order to maintain the same number\nof labourers as before, would be obliged to employ a greater capital. In\norder to get back this greater capital, together with the ordinary profits\nof stock, it would be necessary that he should retain a larger portion,\nor, what comes to the same thing, the price of a larger portion, of the\nproduce of the land, and, consequently, that he should pay less rent to\nthe landlord. The final payment of this rise of wages, therefore, would,\nin this case, fall upon the landlord, together with the additional profit\nof the farmer who had advanced it. In all cases, a direct tax upon the\nwages of labour must, in the long-run, occasion both a greater reduction\nin the rent of land, and a greater rise in the price of manufactured goods\nthan would have followed from the proper assessment of a sum equal to the\nproduce of the tax, partly upon the rent of land, and partly upon\nconsumable commodities.\nIf direct taxes upon the wages of labour have not always occasioned a\nproportionable rise in those wages, it is because they have generally\noccasioned a considerable fall in the demand of labour. The declension of\nindustry, the decrease of employment for the poor, the diminution of the\nannual produce of the land and labour of the country, have generally been\nthe effects of such taxes. In consequence of them, however, the price of\nlabour must always be higher than it otherwise would have been in the\nactual state of the demand; and this enhancement of price, together with\nthe profit of those who advance it, must always be finally paid by the\nlandlords and consumers.\nA tax upon the wages of country labour does not raise the price of the\nrude produce of land in proportion to the tax; for the same reason that a\ntax upon the farmer\u2019s profit does not raise that price in that proportion.\nAbsurd and destructive as such taxes are, however, they take place in many\ncountries. In France, that part of the taille which is charged upon the\nindustry of workmen and day-labourers in country villages, is properly a\ntax of this kind. Their wages are computed according to the common rate of\nthe district in which they reside; and, that they may be as little liable\nas possible to any overcharge, their yearly gains are estimated at no more\nthan two hundred working days in the year. {Memoires concernant les\nDroits, etc. tom. ii. p. 108.} The tax of each individual is varied from\nyear to year, according to different circumstances, of which the collector\nor the commissary, whom intendant appoints to assist him, are the judges.\nIn Bohemia, in consequence of the alteration in the system of finances\nwhich was begun in 1748, a very heavy tax is imposed upon the industry of\nartificers. They are divided into four classes. The highest class pay a\nhundred florins a year, which, at two-and-twenty pence half penny\na-florin, amounts to \u00a39:7:6. The second class are taxed at seventy; the\nthird at fifty; and the fourth, comprehending artificers in villages, and\nthe lowest class of those in towns, at twenty-five florins. {Memoires\nconcernant les Droits, etc. tom. iii. p. 87.}\nThe recompence of ingenious artists, and of men of liberal professions, I\nhave endeavoured to show in the first book, necessarily keeps a certain\nproportion to the emoluments of inferior trades. A tax upon this\nrecompence, therefore, could have no other effect than to raise it\nsomewhat higher than in proportion to the tax. If it did not rise in this\nmanner, the ingenious arts and the liberal professions, being no longer\nupon a level with other trades, would be so much deserted, that they would\nsoon return to that level.\nThe emoluments of offices are not, like those of trades and professions,\nregulated by the free competition of the market, and do not, therefore,\nalways bear a just proportion to what the nature of the employment\nrequires. They are, perhaps, in most countries, higher than it requires;\nthe persons who have the administration of government being generally\ndisposed to regard both themselves and their immediate dependents, rather\nmore than enough. The emoluments of offices, therefore, can, in most\ncases, very well bear to be taxed. The persons, besides, who enjoy public\noffices, especially the more lucrative, are, in all countries, the objects\nof general envy; and a tax upon their emoluments, even though it should be\nsomewhat higher than upon any other sort of revenue, is always a very\npopular tax. In England, for example, when, by the land-tax, every other\nsort of revenue was supposed to be assessed at four shillings in the\npound, it was very popular to lay a real tax of five shillings and\nsixpence in the pound upon the salaries of offices which exceeded a\nhundred pounds a-year; the pensions of the younger branches of the royal\nfamily, the pay of the officers of the army and navy, and a few others\nless obnoxious to envy, excepted. There are in England no other direct\ntaxes upon the wages of labour.\nARTICLE IV.\u2014Taxes which it is intended should fall indifferently\nupon every different Species of Revenue.\nThe taxes which it is intended should fall indifferently upon every\ndifferent species of revenue, are capitation taxes, and taxes upon\nconsumable commodities. Those must be paid indifferently, from whatever\nrevenue the contributors may possess; from the rent of their land, from\nthe profits of their stock, or from the wages of their labour.\nCapitation Taxes.\nCapitation taxes, if it is attempted to proportion them to the fortune or\nrevenue of each contributor, become altogether arbitrary. The state of a\nman\u2019s fortune varies from day to day; and, without an inquisition, more\nintolerable than any tax, and renewed at least once every year, can only\nbe guessed at. His assessment, therefore, must, in most cases, depend upon\nthe good or bad humour of his assessors, and must, therefore, be\naltogether arbitrary and uncertain.\nCapitation taxes, if they are proportioned, not to the supposed fortune,\nbut to the rank of each contributor, become altogether unequal; the\ndegrees of fortune being frequently unequal in the same degree of rank.\nSuch taxes, therefore, if it is attempted to render them equal, become\naltogether arbitrary and uncertain; and if it is attempted to render them\ncertain and not arbitrary, become altogether unequal. Let the tax be light\nor heavy, uncertainty is always a great grievance. In a light tax, a\nconsiderable degree of inequality may be supported; in a heavy one, it is\naltogether intolerable.\nIn the different poll-taxes which took place in England during the reign\nof William III. the contributors were, the greater part of them, assessed\naccording to the degree of their rank; as dukes, marquises, earls,\nviscounts, barons, esquires, gentlemen, the eldest and youngest sons of\npeers, etc. All shop-keepers and tradesmen worth more than three hundred\npounds, that is, the better sort of them, were subject to the same\nassessment, how great soever might be the difference in their fortunes.\nTheir rank was more considered than their fortune. Several of those who,\nin the first poll-tax, were rated according to their supposed fortune were\nafterwards rated according to their rank. Serjeants, attorneys, and\nproctors at law, who, in the first poll-tax, were assessed at three\nshillings in the pound of their supposed income, were afterwards assessed\nas gentlemen. In the assessment of a tax which was not very heavy, a\nconsiderable degree of inequality had been found less insupportable than\nany degree of uncertainty.\nIn the capitation which has been levied in France, without-any\ninterruption, since the beginning of the present century, the highest\norders of people are rated according to their rank, by an invariable\ntariff; the lower orders of people, according to what is supposed to be\ntheir fortune, by an assessment which varies from year to year. The\nofficers of the king\u2019s court, the judges, and other officers in the\nsuperior courts of justice, the officers of the troops, etc are assessed\nin the first manner. The inferior ranks of people in the provinces are\nassessed in the second. In France, the great easily submit to a\nconsiderable degree of inequality in a tax which, so far as it affects\nthem, is not a very heavy one; but could not brook the arbitrary\nassessment of an intendant.\nThe inferior ranks of people must, in that country, suffer patiently the\nusage which their superiors think proper to give them.\nIn England, the different poll-taxes never produced the sum which had been\nexpected from them, or which it was supposed they might have produced, had\nthey been exactly levied. In France, the capitation always produces the\nsum expected from it. The mild government of England, when it assessed the\ndifferent ranks of people to the poll-tax, contented itself with what that\nassessment happened to produce, and required no compensation for the loss\nwhich the state might sustain, either by those who could not pay, or by\nthose who would not pay (for there were many such), and who, by the\nindulgent execution of the law, were not forced to pay. The more severe\ngovernment of France assesses upon each generality a certain sum, which\nthe intendant must find as he can. If any province complains of being\nassessed too high, it may, in the assessment of next year, obtain an\nabatement proportioned to the overcharge of the year before; but it must\npay in the mean time. The intendant, in order to be sure of finding the\nsum assessed upon his generality, was empowered to assess it in a larger\nsum, that the failure or inability of some of the contributors might be\ncompensated by the overcharge of the rest; and till 1765, the fixation of\nthis surplus assessment was left altogether to his discretion. In that\nyear, indeed, the council assumed this power to itself. In the capitation\nof the provinces, it is observed by the perfectly well informed author of\nthe Memoirs upon the Impositions in France, the proportion which falls\nupon the nobility, and upon those whose privileges exempt them from the\ntaille, is the least considerable. The largest falls upon those subject to\nthe taille, who are assessed to the capitation at so much a-pound of what\nthey pay to that other tax. Capitation taxes, so far as they are levied\nupon the lower ranks of people, are direct taxes upon the wages of labour,\nand are attended with all the inconveniencies of such taxes.\nCapitation taxes are levied at little expense; and, where they are\nrigorously exacted, afford a very sure revenue to the state. It is upon\nthis account that, in countries where the case, comfort, and security of\nthe inferior ranks of people are little attended to, capitation taxes are\nvery common. It is in general, however, but a small part of the public\nrevenue, which, in a great empire, has ever been drawn from such taxes;\nand the greatest sum which they have ever afforded, might always have been\nfound in some other way much more convenient to the people.\nTaxes upon Consumable Commodities.\nThe impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their revenue, by\nany capitation, seems to have given occasion to the invention of taxes\nupon consumable commodities. The state not knowing how to tax, directly\nand proportionably, the revenue of its subjects, endeavours to tax it\nindirectly by taxing their expense, which, it is supposed, will, in most\ncases, be nearly in proportion to their revenue. Their expense is taxed,\nby taxing the consumable commodities upon which it is laid out.\nConsumable commodities are either necessaries or luxuries.\nBy necessaries I understand, not only the commodities which are\nindispensibly necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom\nof the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the\nlowest order, to be without. A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly\nspeaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose,\nvery comfortably, though they had no linen. But in the present times,\nthrough the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be\nashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would\nbe supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty, which, it is\npresumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom,\nin the same manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in\nEngland. The poorest creditable person, of either sex, would be ashamed to\nappear in public without them. In Scotland, custom has rendered them a\nnecessary of life to the lowest order of men; but not to the same order of\nwomen, who may, without any discredit, walk about barefooted. In France,\nthey are necessaries neither to men nor to women; the lowest rank of both\nsexes appearing there publicly, without any discredit, sometimes in wooden\nshoes, and sometimes barefooted. Under necessaries, therefore, I\ncomprehend, not only those things which nature, but those things which the\nestablished rules of decency have rendered necessary to the lowest rank of\npeople. All other things I call luxuries, without meaning, by this\nappellation, to throw the smallest degree of reproach upon the temperate\nuse of them. Beer and ale, for example, in Great Britain, and wine, even\nin the wine countries, I call luxuries. A man of any rank may, without any\nreproach, abstain totally from tasting such liquors. Nature does not\nrender them necessary for the support of life; and custom nowhere renders\nit indecent to live without them.\nAs the wages of labour are everywhere regulated, partly by the demand for\nit, and partly by the average price of the necessary articles of\nsubsistence; whatever raises this average price must necessarily raise\nthose wages; so that the labourer may still be able to purchase that\nquantity of those necessary articles which the state of the demand for\nlabour, whether increasing, stationary, or declining, requires that he\nshould have. {See book i.chap. 8} A tax upon those articles necessarily\nraises their price somewhat higher than the amount of the tax, because the\ndealer, who advances the tax, must generally get it back, with a profit.\nSuch a tax must, therefore, occasion a rise in the wages of labour,\nproportionable to this rise of price.\nIt is thus that a tax upon the necessaries of life operates exactly in the\nsame manner as a direct tax upon the wages of labour. The labourer, though\nhe may pay it out of his hand, cannot, for any considerable time at least,\nbe properly said even to advance it. It must always, in the long-run, be\nadvanced to him by his immediate employer, in the advanced state of wages.\nHis employer, if he is a manufacturer, will charge upon the price of his\ngoods the rise of wages, together with a profit, so that the final payment\nof the tax, together with this overcharge, will fall upon the consumer. If\nhis employer is a farmer, the final payment, together with a like\novercharge, will fall upon the rent of the landlord.\nIt is otherwise with taxes upon what I call luxuries, even upon those of\nthe poor. The rise in the price of the taxed commodities, will not\nnecessarily occasion any rise in the wages of labour. A tax upon tobacco,\nfor example, though a luxury of the poor, as well as of the rich, will not\nraise wages. Though it is taxed in England at three times, and in France\nat fifteen times its original price, those high duties seem to have no\neffect upon the wages of labour. The same thing maybe said of the taxes\nupon tea and sugar, which, in England and Holland, have become luxuries of\nthe lowest ranks of people; and of those upon chocolate, which, in Spain,\nis said to have become so.\nThe different taxes which, in Great Britain, have, in the course of the\npresent century, been imposed upon spiritous liquors, are not supposed to\nhave had any effect upon the wages of labour. The rise in the price of\nporter, occasioned by an additional tax of three shillings upon the barrel\nof strong beer, has not raised the wages of common labour in London. These\nwere about eighteen pence or twenty pence a-day before the tax, and they\nare not more now.\nThe high price of such commodities does not necessarily diminish the\nability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families. Upon the\nsober and industrious poor, taxes upon such commodities act as sumptuary\nlaws, and dispose them either to moderate, or to refrain altogether from\nthe use of superfluities which they can no longer easily afford. Their\nability to bring up families, in consequence of this forced frugality,\ninstead of being diminished, is frequently, perhaps, increased by the tax.\nIt is the sober and industrious poor who generally bring up the most\nnumerous families, and who principally supply the demand for useful\nlabour. All the poor, indeed, are not sober and industrious; and the\ndissolute and disorderly might continue to indulge themselves in the use\nof such commodities, after this rise of price, in the same manner as\nbefore, without regarding the distress which this indulgence might bring\nupon their families. Such disorderly persons, however, seldom rear up\nnumerous families, their children generally perishing from neglect,\nmismanagement, and the scantiness or unwholesomeness of their food. If by\nthe strength of their constitution, they survive the hardships to which\nthe bad conduct of their parents exposes them, yet the example of that bad\nconduct commonly corrupts their morals; so that, instead of being useful\nto society by their industry, they become public nuisances by their vices\nand disorders. Through the advanced price of the luxuries of the poor,\ntherefore, might increase somewhat the distress of such disorderly\nfamilies, and thereby diminish somewhat their ability to bring up\nchildren, it would not probably diminish much the useful population of the\ncountry.\nAny rise in the average price of necessaries, unless it be compensated by\na proportionable rise in the wages of labour, must necessarily diminish,\nmore or less, the ability of the poor to bring up numerous families, and,\nconsequently, to supply the demand for useful labour; whatever may be the\nstate of that demand, whether increasing, stationary, or declining; or\nsuch as requires an increasing, stationary, or declining population.\nTaxes upon luxuries have no tendency to raise the price of any other\ncommodities, except that of the commodities taxed. Taxes upon necessaries,\nby raising the wages of labour, necessarily tend to raise the price of all\nmanufactures, and consequently to diminish the extent of their sale and\nconsumption. Taxes upon luxuries are finally paid by the consumers of the\ncommodities taxed, without any retribution. They fall indifferently upon\nevery species of revenue, the wages of labour, the profits of stock, and\nthe rent of land. Taxes upon necessaries, so far as they affect the\nlabouring poor, are finally paid, partly by landlords, in the diminished\nrent of their lands, and partly by rich consumers, whether landlords or\nothers, in the advanced price of manufactured goods; and always with a\nconsiderable overcharge. The advanced price of such manufactures as are\nreal necessaries of life, and are destined for the consumption of the\npoor, of coarse woollens, for example, must be compensated to the poor by\na farther advancement of their wages. The middling and superior ranks of\npeople, if they understood their own interest, ought always to oppose all\ntaxes upon the necessaries of life, as well as all taxes upon the wages of\nlabour. The final payment of both the one and the other falls altogether\nupon themselves, and always with a considerable overcharge. They fall\nheaviest upon the landlords, who always pay in a double capacity; in that\nof landlords, by the reduction, of their rent; and in that of rich\nconsumers, by the increase of their expense. The observation of Sir\nMatthew Decker, that certain taxes are, in the price of certain goods,\nsometimes repeated and accumulated four or five times, is perfectly just\nwith regard to taxes upon the necessaries of life. In the price of\nleather, for example, you must pay not only for the tax upon the leather\nof your own shoes, but for a part of that upon those of the shoemaker and\nthe tanner. You must pay, too, for the tax upon the salt, upon the soap,\nand upon the candles which those workmen consume while employed in your\nservice; and for the tax upon the leather, which the saltmaker, the\nsoap-maker, and the candle-maker consume, while employed in their service.\nIn Great Britain, the principal taxes upon the necessaries of life, are\nthose upon the four commodities just now mentioned, salt, leather, soap,\nand candles.\nSalt is a very ancient and a very universal subject of taxation. It was\ntaxed among the Romans, and it is so at present in, I believe, every part\nof Europe. The quantity annually consumed by any individual is so small,\nand may be purchased so gradually, that nobody, it seems to have been\nthought, could feel very sensibly even a pretty heavy tax upon it. It is\nin England taxed at three shillings and fourpence a bushel; about three\ntimes the original price of the commodity. In some other countries, the\ntax is still higher. Leather is a real necessary of life. The use of linen\nrenders soap such. In countries where the winter nights are long, candles\nare a necessary instrument of trade. Leather and soap are in Great Britain\ntaxed at three halfpence a-pound; candles at a penny; taxes which, upon\nthe original price of leather, may amount to about eight or ten per cent.;\nupon that of soap, to about twenty or five-and-twenty per cent.; and upon\nthat of candles to about fourteen or fifteen per cent.; taxes which,\nthough lighter than that upon salt, are still very heavy. As all those\nfour commodities are real necessaries of life, such heavy taxes upon them\nmust increase somewhat the expense of the sober and industrious poor, and\nmust consequently raise more or less the wages of their labour.\nIn a country where the winters are so cold as in Great Britain, fuel is,\nduring that season, in the strictest sense of the word, a necessary of\nlife, not only for the purpose of dressing victuals, but for the\ncomfortable subsistence of many different sorts of workmen who work within\ndoors; and coals are the cheapest of all fuel. The price of fuel has so\nimportant an influence upon that of labour, that all over Great Britain,\nmanufactures have confined themselves principally to the coal counties;\nother parts of the country, on account of the high price of this necessary\narticle, not being able to work so cheap. In some manufactures, besides,\ncoal is a necessary instrument of trade; as in those of glass, iron, and\nall other metals. If a bounty could in any case be reasonable, it might\nperhaps be so upon the transportation of coals from those parts of the\ncountry in which they abound, to those in which they are wanted. But the\nlegislature, instead of a bounty, has imposed a tax of three shillings and\nthreepence a-ton upon coals carried coastways; which, upon most sorts of\ncoal, is more than sixty per cent. of the original price at the coal pit.\nCoals carried, either by land or by inland navigation, pay no duty. Where\nthey are naturally cheap, they are consumed duty free; where they are\nnaturally dear, they are loaded with a heavy duty.\nSuch taxes, though they raise the price of subsistence, and consequently\nthe wages of labour, yet they afford a considerable revenue to government,\nwhich it might not be easy to find in any other way. There may, therefore,\nbe good reasons for continuing them. The bounty upon the exportation of\ncorn, so far as it tends, in the actual state of tillage, to raise the\nprice of that necessary article, produces all the like bad effects; and\ninstead of affording any revenue, frequently occasions a very great\nexpense to government. The high duties upon the importation of foreign\ncorn, which, in years of moderate plenty, amount to a prohibition; and the\nabsolute prohibition of the importation, either of live cattle, or of salt\nprovisions, which takes place in the ordinary state of the law, and which,\non account of the scarcity, is at present suspended for a limited time\nwith regard to Ireland and the British plantations, have all had the bad\neffects of taxes upon the necessaries of life, and produce no revenue to\ngovernment. Nothing seems necessary for the repeal of such regulations,\nbut to convince the public of the futility of that system in consequence\nof which they have been established.\nTaxes upon the necessaries of life are much higher in many other countries\nthan in Great Britain. Duties upon flour and meal when ground at the mill,\nand upon bread when baked at the oven, take place in many countries. In\nHolland the money-price of the bread consumed in towns is supposed to be\ndoubled by means of such taxes. In lieu of a part of them, the people who\nlive in the country, pay every year so much a-head, according to the sort\nof bread they are supposed to consume. Those who consume wheaten bread pay\nthree guilders fifteen stivers; about six shillings and ninepence\nhalfpenny. Those, and some other taxes of the same kind, by raising the\nprice of labour, are said to have ruined the greater part of the\nmanufactures of Holland {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. p. 210,\n211.}. Similar taxes, though not quite so heavy, take place in the\nMilanese, in the states of Genoa, in the duchy of Modena, in the duchies\nof Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, and the Ecclesiastical state. A French\nauthor {Le Reformateur} of some note, has proposed to reform the finances\nof his country, by substituting in the room of the greater part of other\ntaxes, this most ruinous of all taxes. There is nothing so absurd, says\nCicero, which has not sometimes been asserted by some philosophers.\nTaxes upon butcher\u2019s meat are still more common than those upon bread. It\nmay indeed be doubted, whether butcher\u2019s meat is any where a necessary of\nlife. Grain and other vegetables, with the help of milk, cheese, and\nbutter, or oil, where butter is not to be had, it is known from\nexperience, can, without any butcher\u2019s meat, afford the most plentiful,\nthe most wholesome, the most nourishing, and the most invigorating diet.\nDecency nowhere requires that any man should eat butcher\u2019s meat, as it in\nmost places requires that he should wear a linen shirt or a pair of\nleather shoes.\nConsumable commodities, whether necessaries or luxuries, may be taxed in\ntwo different ways. The consumer may either pay an annual sum on account\nof his using or consuming goods of a certain kind; or the goods may be\ntaxed while they remain in the hands of the dealer, and before they are\ndelivered to the consumer. The consumable goods which last a considerable\ntime before they are consumed altogether, are most properly taxed in the\none way; those of which the consumption is either immediate or more\nspeedy, in the other. The coach-tax and plate tax are examples of the\nformer method of imposing; the greater part of the other duties of excise\nand customs, of the latter.\nA coach may, with good management, last ten or twelve years. It might be\ntaxed, once for all, before it comes out of the hands of the coach-maker.\nBut it is certainly more convenient for the buyer to pay four pounds\na-year for the privilege of keeping a coach, than to pay all at once forty\nor forty-eight pounds additional price to the coach-maker; or a sum\nequivalent to what the tax is likely to cost him during the time he uses\nthe same coach. A service of plate in the same manner, may last more than\na century. It is certainly-easier for the consumer to pay five shillings\na-year for every hundred ounces of plate, near one per cent. of the value,\nthan to redeem this long annuity at five-and-twenty or thirty years\npurchase, which would enhance the price at least five-and-twenty or thirty\nper cent. The different taxes which affect houses, are certainly more\nconveniently paid by moderate annual payments, than by a heavy tax of\nequal value upon the first building or sale of the house.\nIt was the well-known proposal of Sir Matthew Decker, that all\ncommodities, even those of which the consumption is either immediate or\nspeedy, should be taxed in this manner; the dealer advancing nothing, but\nthe consumer paying a certain annual sum for the licence to consume\ncertain goods. The object of his scheme was to promote all the different\nbranches of foreign trade, particularly the carrying trade, by taking away\nall duties upon importation and exportation, and thereby enabling the\nmerchant to employ his whole capital and credit in the purchase of goods\nand the freight of ships, no part of either being diverted towards the\nadvancing of taxes, The project, however, of taxing, in this manner, goods\nof immediate or speedy consumption, seems liable to the four following\nvery important objections. First, the tax would be more unequal, or not so\nwell proportioned to the expense and consumption of the different\ncontributors, as in the way in which it is commonly imposed. The taxes\nupon ale, wine, and spiritous liquors, which are advanced by the dealers,\nare finally paid by the different consumers, exactly in proportion to\ntheir respective consumption. But if the tax were to be paid by purchasing\na licence to drink those liquors, the sober would, in proportion to his\nconsumption, be taxed much more heavily than the drunken consumer. A\nfamily which exercised great hospitality, would be taxed much more lightly\nthan one who entertained fewer guests. Secondly, this mode of taxation, by\npaying for an annual, half-yearly, or quarterly licence to consume certain\ngoods, would diminish very much one of the principal conveniences of taxes\nupon goods of speedy consumption; the piece-meal payment. In the price of\nthreepence halfpenny, which is at present paid for a pot of porter, the\ndifferent taxes upon malt, hops, and beer, together with the extraordinary\nprofit which the brewer charges for having advanced than, may perhaps\namount to about three halfpence. If a workman can conveniently spare those\nthree halfpence, he buys a pot of porter. If he cannot, he contents\nhimself with a pint; and, as a penny saved is a penny got, he thus gains a\nfarthing by his temperance. He pays the tax piece-meal, as he can afford\nto pay it, and when he can afford to pay it, and every act of payment is\nperfectly voluntary, and what he can avoid if he chuses to do so. Thirdly,\nsuch taxes would operate less as sumptuary laws. When the licence was once\npurchased, whether the purchaser drunk much or drunk little, his tax would\nbe the same. Fourthly, if a workman were to pay all at once, by yearly,\nhalf-yearly, or quarterly payments, a tax equal to what he at present\npays, with little or no inconveniency, upon all the different pots and\npints of porter which he drinks in any such period of time, the sum might\nfrequently distress him very much. This mode of taxation, therefore, it\nseems evident, could never, without the most grievous oppression, produce\na revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the present mode without\nany oppression. In several countries, however, commodities of an immediate\nor very speedy consumption are taxed in this manner. In Holland, people\npay so much a-head for a licence to drink tea. I have already mentioned a\ntax upon bread, which, so far as it is consumed in farm houses and country\nvillages, is there levied in the same manner.\nThe duties of excise are imposed chiefly upon goods of home produce,\ndestined for home consumption. They are imposed only upon a few sorts of\ngoods of the most general use. There can never be any doubt, either\nconcerning the goods which are subject to those duties, or concerning the\nparticular duty which each species of goods is subject to. They fall\nalmost altogether upon what I call luxuries, excepting always the four\nduties above mentioned, upon salt, soap, leather, candles, and perhaps\nthat upon green glass.\nThe duties of customs are much more ancient than those of excise. They\nseem to have been called customs, as denoting customary payments, which\nhad been in use for time immemorial. They appear to have been originally\nconsidered as taxes upon the profits of merchants. During the barbarous\ntimes of feudal anarchy, merchants, like all the other inhabitants of\nburghs, were considered as little better than emancipated bondmen, whose\npersons were despised, and whose gains were envied. The great nobility,\nwho had consented that the king should tallage the profits of their own\ntenants, were not unwilling that he should tallage likewise those of an\norder of men whom it was much less their interest to protect. In those\nignorant times, it was not understood, that the profits of merchants are a\nsubject not taxable directly; or that the final payment of all such taxes\nmust fall, with a considerable overcharge, upon the consumers.\nThe gains of alien merchants were looked upon more unfavourably than those\nof English merchants. It was natural, therefore, that those of the former\nshould be taxed more heavily than those of the latter. This distinction\nbetween the duties upon aliens and those upon English merchants, which was\nbegun from ignorance, has been continued front the spirit of monopoly, or\nin order to give our own merchants an advantage, both in the home and in\nthe foreign market.\nWith this distinction, the ancient duties of customs were imposed equally\nupon all sorts of goods, necessaries as well its luxuries, goods exported\nas well as goods imported. Why should the dealers in one sort of goods, it\nseems to have been thought, be more favoured than those in another? or why\nshould the merchant exporter be more favoured than the merchant importer?\nThe ancient customs were divided into three branches. The first, and,\nperhaps, the most ancient of all those duties, was that upon wool and\nleather. It seems to have been chiefly or altogether an exportation duty.\nWhen the woollen manufacture came to be established in England, lest the\nking should lose any part of his customs upon wool by the exportation of\nwoollen cloths, a like duty was imposed upon them. The other two branches\nwere, first, a duty upon wine, which being imposed at so much a-ton, was\ncalled a tonnage; and, secondly, a duty upon all other goods, which being\nimposed at so much a-pound of their supposed value, was called a poundage.\nIn the forty-seventh year of Edward III., a duty of sixpence in the pound\nwas imposed upon all goods exported and imported, except wools,\nwool-felts, leather, and wines which were subject to particular duties. In\nthe fourteenth of Richard II., this duty was raised to one shilling in the\npound; but, three years afterwards, it was again reduced to sixpence. It\nwas raised to eightpence in the second year of Henry IV.; and, in the\nfourth of the same prince, to one shilling. From this time to the ninth\nyear of William III., this duty continued at one shilling in the pound.\nThe duties of tonnage and poundage were generally granted to the king by\none and the same act of parliament, and were called the subsidy of tonnage\nand poundage. The subsidy of poundage having continued for so long a time\nat one shilling in the pound, or at five per cent., a subsidy came, in the\nlanguage of the customs, to denote a general duty of this kind of five per\ncent. This subsidy, which is now called the old subsidy, still continues\nto be levied, according to the book of rates established by the twelfth of\nCharles II. The method of ascertaining, by a book of rates, the value of\ngoods subject to this duty, is said to be older than the time of James I.\nThe new subsidy, imposed by the ninth and tenth of William III., was an\nadditional five per cent. upon the greater part of goods. The one-third\nand the two-third subsidy made up between them another five per cent. of\nwhich they were proportionable parts. The subsidy of 1747 made a fourth\nfive per cent. upon the greater part of goods; and that of 1759, a fifth\nupon some particular sorts of goods. Besides those five subsidies, a great\nvariety of other duties have occasionally been imposed upon particular\nsorts of goods, in order sometimes to relieve the exigencies of the\nstate, and sometimes to regulate the trade of the country, according to\nthe principles of the mercantile system.\nThat system has come gradually more and more into fashion. The old subsidy\nwas imposed indifferently upon exportation, as well as importation. The\nfour subsequent subsidies, as well as the other duties which have since\nbeen occasionally imposed upon particular sorts of goods, have, with a few\nexceptions, been laid altogether upon importation. The greater part of the\nancient duties which had been imposed upon the exportation of the goods of\nhome produce and manufacture, have either been lightened or taken away\naltogether. In most cases, they have been taken away. Bounties have even\nbeen given upon the exportation of some of them. Drawbacks, too, sometimes\nof the whole, and, in most cases, of a part of the duties which are paid\nupon the importation of foreign goods, have been granted upon their\nexportation. Only half the duties imposed by the old subsidy upon\nimportation, are drawn back upon exportation; but the whole of those\nimposed by the latter subsidies and other imposts are, upon the greater\nparts of the goods, drawn back in the same manner. This growing favour of\nexportation, and discouragement of importation, have suffered only a few\nexceptions, which chiefly concern the materials of some manufactures.\nThese our merchants and manufacturers are willing should come as cheap as\npossible to themselves, and as dear as possible to their rivals and\ncompetitors in other countries. Foreign materials are, upon this account,\nsometimes allowed to be imported duty-free; spanish wool, for example,\nflax, and raw linen yarn. The exportation of the materials of home\nproduce, and of those which are the particular produce of our colonies,\nhas sometimes been prohibited, and sometimes subjected to higher duties.\nThe exportation of English wool has been prohibited. That of beaver skins,\nof beaver wool, and of gum-senega, has been subjected to higher duties;\nGreat Britain, by the conquests of Canada and Senegal, having got almost\nthe monopoly of those commodities.\nThat the mercantile system has not been very favourable to the revenue of\nthe great body of the people, to the annual produce of the land and labour\nof the country, I have endeavoured to show in the fourth book of this\nInquiry. It seems not to have been more favourable to the revenue of the\nsovereign; so far, at least, as that revenue depends upon the duties of\ncustoms.\nIn consequence of that system, the importation of several sorts of goods\nhas been prohibited altogether. This prohibition has, in some cases,\nentirely prevented, and in others has very much diminished, the\nimportation of those commodities, by reducing the importers to the\nnecessity of smuggling. It has entirely prevented the importation of\nforeign wollens; and it has very much diminished that of foreign silks and\nvelvets, In both cases, it has entirely annihilated the revenue of customs\nwhich might have been levied upon such importation.\nThe high duties which have been imposed upon the importation of many\ndifferent sorts of foreign goods in order to discourage their consumption\nin Great Britain, have, in many cases, served only to encourage smuggling,\nand, in all cases, have reduced the revenues of the customs below what\nmore moderate duties would have afforded. The saying of Dr Swift, that in\nthe arithmetic of the customs, two and two, instead of making four, make\nsometimes only one, holds perfectly true with regard to such heavy duties,\nwhich never could have been imposed, had not the mercantile system taught\nus, in many cases, to employ taxation as an instrument, not of revenue,\nbut of monopoly.\nThe bounties which are sometimes given upon the exportation of home\nproduce and manufactures, and the drawbacks which are paid upon the\nre-exportation of the greater part of foreign goods, have given occasion\nto many frauds, and to a species of smuggling, more destructive of the\npublic revenue than any other. In order to obtain the bounty or drawback,\nthe goods, it is well known, are sometimes shipped, and sent to sea, but\nsoon afterwards clandestinely re-landed in some other part of the country.\nThe defalcation of the revenue of customs occasioned by bounties and\ndrawbacks, of which a great part are obtained fraudulently, is very great.\nThe gross produce of the customs, in the year which ended on the 5th of\nJanuary 1755, amounted to \u00a35,068,000. The bounties which were paid out of\nthis revenue, though in that year there was no bounty upon corn, amounted\nto \u00a3167,806. The drawbacks which were paid upon debentures and\ncertificates, to \u00a32,156,800. Bounties and drawbacks together amounted to\n\u00a32,324,600. In consequence of these deductions, the revenue of the customs\namounted only to \u00a32,743,400; from which deducting \u00a3287,900 for the expense\nof management, in salaries and other incidents, the neat revenue of the\ncustoms for that year comes out to be \u00a32,455,500. The expense of\nmanagement, amounts, in this manner, to between five and six per cent.\nupon the gross revenue of the customs; and to something more than ten per\ncent. upon what remains of that revenue, after deducting what is paid away\nin bounties and drawbacks.\nHeavy duties being imposed upon almost all goods imported, our merchant\nimporters smuggle as much, and make entry of as little as they can. Our\nmerchant exporters, on the contrary, make entry of more than they export;\nsometimes out of vanity, and to pass for great dealers in goods which pay\nno duty gain a bounty back. Our exports, in consequence of these different\nfrauds, appear upon the custom-house books greatly to overbalance our\nimports, to the unspeakable comfort of those politicians, who measure the\nnational prosperity by what they call the balance of trade.\nAll goods imported, unless particularly exempted, and such exemptions are\nnot very numerous, are liable to some duties of customs. If any goods are\nimported, not mentioned in the book of rates, they are taxed at 4s:9\u00bed.\nfor every twenty shillings value, according to the oath of the importer,\nthat is, nearly at five subsidies, or five poundage duties. The book of\nrates is extremely comprehensive, and enumerates a great variety of\narticles, many of them little used, and, therefore, not well known. It is,\nupon this account, frequently uncertain under what article a particular\nsort of goods ought to be classed, and, consequently what duty they ought\nto pay. Mistakes with regard to this sometimes ruin the custom-house\nofficer, and frequently occasion much trouble, expense, and vexation to\nthe importer. In point of perspicuity, precision, and distinctness,\ntherefore, the duties of customs are much inferior to those of excise.\nIn order that the greater part of the members of any society should\ncontribute to the public revenue, in proportion to their respective\nexpense, it does not seem necessary that every single article of that\nexpense should be taxed. The revenue which is levied by the duties of\nexcise is supposed to fall as equally upon the contributors as that which\nis levied by the duties of customs; and the duties of excise are imposed\nupon a few articles only of the most general used and consumption. It has\nbeen the opinion of many people, that, by proper management, the duties of\ncustoms might likewise, without any loss to the public revenue, and with\ngreat advantage to foreign trade, be confined to a few articles only.\nThe foreign articles, of the most general use and consumption in Great\nBritain, seem at present to consist chiefly in foreign wines and brandies;\nin some of the productions of America and the West Indies, sugar, rum,\ntobacco, cocoa-nuts, etc. and in some of those of the East Indies, tea,\ncoffee, china-ware, spiceries of all kinds, several sorts of piece-goods,\netc. These different articles afford, the greater part of the perhaps, at\npresent, revenue which is drawn from the duties of customs. The taxes\nwhich at present subsist upon foreign manufactures, if you except those\nupon the few contained in the foregoing enumeration, have, the greater\npart of them, been imposed for the purpose, not of revenue, but of\nmonopoly, or to give our own merchants an advantage in the home market. By\nremoving all prohibitions, and by subjecting all foreign manufactures to\nsuch moderate taxes, as it was found from experience, afforded upon each\narticle the greatest revenue to the public, our own workmen might still\nhave a considerable advantage in the home market; and many articles, some\nof which at present afford no revenue to government, and others a very\ninconsiderable one, might afford a very great one.\nHigh taxes, sometimes by diminishing the consumption of the taxed\ncommodities, and sometimes by encouraging smuggling frequently afford a\nsmaller revenue to government than what might be drawn from more moderate\ntaxes.\nWhen the diminution of revenue is the effect of the diminution of\nconsumption, there can be but one remedy, and that is the lowering of the\ntax. When the diminution of revenue is the effect of the encouragement\ngiven to smuggling, it may, perhaps, be remedied in two ways; either by\ndiminishing the temptation to smuggle, or by increasing the difficulty of\nsmuggling. The temptation to smuggle can be diminished only by the\nlowering of the tax; and the difficulty of smuggling can be increased only\nby establishing that system of administration which is most proper for\npreventing it.\nThe excise laws, it appears, I believe, from experience, obstruct and\nembarrass the operations of the smuggler much more effectually than those\nof the customs. By introducing into the customs a system of administration\nas similar to that of the excise as the nature of the different duties\nwill admit, the difficulty of smuggling might be very much increased. This\nalteration, it has been supposed by many people, might very easily be\nbrought about.\nThe importer of commodities liable to any duties of customs, it has been\nsaid, might, at his option, be allowed either to carry them to his own\nprivate warehouse; or to lodge them in a warehouse, provided either at his\nown expense or at that of the public, but under the key of the\ncustom-house officer, and never to be opened but in his presence. If the\nmerchant carried them to his own private warehouse, the duties to be\nimmediately paid, and never afterwards to be drawn back; and that\nwarehouse to be at all times subject to the visit and examination of the\ncustom-house officer, in order to ascertain how far the quantity contained\nin it corresponded with that for which the duty had been paid. If he\ncarried them to the public warehouse, no duty to be paid till they were\ntaken out for home consumption. If taken out for exportation, to be\nduty-free; proper security being always given that they should be so\nexported. The dealers in those particular commodities, either by wholesale\nor retail, to be at all times subject to the visit and examination of the\ncustom-house officer; and to be obliged to justify, by proper\ncertificates, the payment of the duty upon the whole quantity contained in\ntheir shops or warehouses. What are called the excise duties upon rum\nimported, are at present levied in this manner; and the same system of\nadministration might, perhaps, be extended to all duties upon goods\nimported; provided always that those duties were, like the duties of\nexcise, confined to a few sorts of goods of the most general use and\nconsumption. If they were extended to almost all sorts of goods, as at\npresent, public warehouses of sufficient extent could not easily be\nprovided; and goods of a very delicate nature, or of which the\npreservation required much care and attention, could not safely be trusted\nby the merchant in any warehouse but his own.\nIf, by such a system of administration, smuggling to any considerable\nextent could be prevented, even under pretty high duties; and if every\nduty was occasionally either heightened or lowered according as it was\nmost likely, either the one way or the other, to afford the greatest\nrevenue to the state; taxation being always employed as an instrument of\nrevenue, and never of monopoly; it seems not improbable that a revenue, at\nleast equal to the present neat revenue of the customs, might be drawn\nfrom duties upon the importation of only a few sorts of goods of the most\ngeneral use and consumption; and that the duties of customs might thus be\nbrought to the same degree of simplicity, certainty, and precision, as\nthose of excise. What the revenue at present loses by drawbacks upon the\nre-exportation of foreign goods, which are afterwards re-landed and\nconsumed at home, would, under this system, be saved altogether. If to\nthis saving, which would alone be very considerable, were added the\nabolition of all bounties upon the exportation of home produce; in all\ncases in which those bounties were not in reality drawbacks of some duties\nof excise which had before been advanced; it cannot well be doubted, but\nthat the neat revenue of customs might, after an alteration of this kind,\nbe fully equal to what it had ever been before.\nIf, by such a change of system, the public revenue suffered no loss, the\ntrade and manufactures of the country would certainly gain a very\nconsiderable advantage. The trade in the commodities not taxed, by far the\ngreatest number would be perfectly free, and might be carried on to and\nfrom all parts of the world with every possible advantage. Among those\ncommodities would be comprehended all the necessaries of life, and all the\nmaterials of manufacture. So far as the free importation of the\nnecessaries of life reduced their average money price in the home market,\nit would reduce the money price of labour, but without reducing in any\nrespect its real recompence. The value of money is in proportion to the\nquantity of the necessaries of life which it will purchase. That of the\nnecessaries of life is altogether independent of the quantity of money\nwhich can be had for them. The reduction in the money price of labour\nwould necessarily be attended with a proportionable one in that of all\nhome manufactures, which would thereby gain some advantage in all foreign\nmarkets. The price of some manufactures would be reduced, in a still\ngreater proportion, by the free importation of the raw materials. If raw\nsilk could be imported from China and Indostan, duty-free, the silk\nmanufacturers in England could greatly undersell those of both France and\nItaly. There would be no occasion to prohibit the importation of foreign\nsilks and velvets. The cheapness of their goods would secure to our own\nworkmen, not only the possession of a home, but a very great command of\nthe foreign market. Even the trade in the commodities taxed, would be\ncarried on with much more advantage than at present. If those commodities\nwere delivered out of the public warehouse for foreign exportation, being\nin this case exempted from all taxes, the trade in them would be perfectly\nfree. The carrying trade, in all sorts of goods, would, under this system,\nenjoy every possible advantage. If these commodities were delivered out\nfor home consumption, the importer not being obliged to advance the tax\ntill he had an opportunity of selling his goods, either to some dealer, or\nto some consumer, he could always afford to sell them cheaper than if he\nhad been obliged to advance it at the moment of importation. Under the\nsame taxes, the foreign trade of consumption, even in the taxed\ncommodities, might in this manner be carried on with much more advantage\nthan it is at present.\nIt was the object of the famous excise scheme of Sir Robert Walpole, to\nestablish, with regard to wine and tobacco, a system not very unlike that\nwhich is here proposed. But though the bill which was then brought into\nParliament, comprehended those two commodities only, it was generally\nsupposed to be meant as an introduction to a more extensive scheme of the\nsame kind. Faction, combined with the interest of smuggling merchants,\nraised so violent, though so unjust a clamour, against that bill, that the\nminister thought proper to drop it; and, from a dread of exciting a\nclamour of the same kind, none of his successors have dared to resume the\nproject.\nThe duties upon foreign luxuries, imported for home consumption, though\nthey sometimes fall upon the poor, fall principally upon people of\nmiddling or more than middling fortune. Such are, for example, the duties\nupon foreign wines, upon coffee, chocolate, tea, sugar, etc.\nThe duties upon the cheaper luxuries of home produce, destined for home\nconsumption, fall pretty equally upon people of all ranks, in proportion\nto their respective expense. The poor pay the duties upon malt, hops,\nbeer, and ale, upon their own consumption; the rich, upon both their own\nconsumption and that of their servants.\nThe whole consumption of the inferior ranks of people, or of those below\nthe middling rank, it must be observed, is, in every country, much\ngreater, not only in quantity, but in value, than that of the middling,\nand of those above the middling rank. The whole expense of the inferior is\nmuch greater titan that of the superior ranks. In the first place, almost\nthe whole capital of every country is annually distributed among the\ninferior ranks of people, as the wages of productive labour. Secondly, a\ngreat part of the revenue, arising from both the rent of land and the\nprofits of stock, is annually distributed among the same rank, in the\nwages and maintenance of menial servants, and other unproductive\nlabourers. Thirdly, some part of the profits of stock belongs to the same\nrank, as a revenue arising from the employment of their small capitals.\nThe amount of the profits annually made by small shopkeepers, tradesmen,\nand retailers of all kinds, is everywhere very considerable, and makes a\nvery considerable portion of the annual produce. Fourthly and lastly, some\npart even of the rent of land belongs to the same rank; a considerable\npart to those who are somewhat below the middling rank, and a small part\neven to the lowest rank; common labourers sometimes possessing in property\nan acre or two of land. Though the expense of those inferior ranks of\npeople, therefore, taking them individually, is very small, yet the whole\nmass of it, taking them collectively, amounts always to by much the\nlargest portion of the whole expense of the society; what remains of the\nannual produce of the land and labour of the country, for the consumption\nof the superior ranks, being always much less, not only in quantity, but\nin value. The taxes upon expense, therefore, which fall chiefly upon that\nof the superior ranks of people, upon the smaller portion of the annual\nproduce, are likely to be much less productive than either those which\nfall indifferently upon the expense of all ranks, or even those which fall\nchiefly upon that of the inferior ranks, than either those which fall\nindifferently upon the whole annual produce, or those which fall chiefly\nupon the larger portion of it. The excise upon the materials and\nmanufacture of home-made fermented and spirituous liquors, is,\naccordingly, of all the different taxes upon expense, by far the most\nproductive; and this branch of the excise falls very much, perhaps\nprincipally, upon the expense of the common people. In the year which\nended on the 5th of July 1775, the gross produce of this branch of the\nexcise amounted to \u00a33,341,837:9:9.\nIt must always be remembered, however, that it is the luxuries, and not\nthe necessary expense of the inferior ranks of people, that ought ever to\nbe taxed. The final payment of any tax upon their necessary expense, would\nfall altogether upon the superior ranks of people; upon the smaller\nportion of the annual produce, and not upon the greater. Such a tax must,\nin all cases, either raise the wages of labour, or lessen the demand for\nit. It could not raise the wages of labour, without throwing the final\npayment of the tax upon the superior ranks of people. It could not lessen\nthe demand for labour, without lessening the annual produce of the land\nand labour of the country, the fund upon which all taxes must be finally\npaid. Whatever might be the state to which a tax of this kind reduced the\ndemand for labour, it must always raise wages higher than they otherwise\nwould be in that state; and the final payment of this enhancement of wages\nmust, in all cases, fall upon the superior ranks of people.\nFermented liquors brewed, and spiritous liquors distilled, not for sale,\nbut for private use, are not in Great Britain liable to any duties of\nexcise. This exemption, of which the object is to save private families\nfrom the odious visit and examination of the tax-gatherer, occasions the\nburden of those duties to fall frequently much lighter upon the rich than\nupon the poor. It is not, indeed, very common to distil for private use,\nthough it is done sometimes. But in the country, many middling and almost\nall rich and great families, brew their own beer. Their strong beer,\ntherefore, costs them eight shillings a-barrel less than it costs the\ncommon brewer, who must have his profit upon the tax, as well as upon all\nthe other expense which he advances. Such families, therefore, must drink\ntheir beer at least nine or ten shillings a-barrel cheaper than any liquor\nof the same quality can be drank by the common people, to whom it is\neverywhere more convenient to buy their beer, by little and little, from\nthe brewery or the ale-house. Malt, in the same manner, that is made for\nthe use of a private family, is not liable to the visit or examination of\nthe tax-gatherer but, in this case the family must compound at seven\nshillings and sixpence a-head for the tax. Seven shillings and sixpence\nare equal to the excise upon ten bushels of malt; a quantity fully equal\nto what all the different members of any sober family, men, women, and\nchildren, are, at an average, likely to consume. But in rich and great\nfamilies, where country hospitality is much practised, the malt liquors\nconsumed by the members of the family make but a small part of the\nconsumption of the house. Either on account of this composition, however,\nor for other reasons, it is not near so common to malt as to brew for\nprivate use. It is difficult to imagine any equitable reason, why those\nwho either brew or distil for private use should not be subject to a\ncomposition of the same kind.\nA greater revenue than what is at present drawn from all the heavy taxes\nupon malt, beer, and ale, might be raised, it has frequently been said, by\na much lighter tax upon malt; the opportunities of defrauding the revenue\nbeing much greater in a brewery than in a malt-house; and those who brew\nfor private use being exempted from all duties or composition for duties,\nwhich is not the case with those who malt for private use.\nIn the porter brewery of London, a quarter of malt is commonly brewed into\nmore than two barrels and a-half, sometimes into three barrels of porter.\nThe different taxes upon malt amount to six shillings a-quarter; those\nupon strong ale and beer to eight shillings a-barrel. In the porter\nbrewery, therefore, the different taxes upon malt, beer, and ale, amount\nto between twenty-six and thirty shillings upon the produce of a quarter\nof malt. In the country brewery for common country sale, a quarter of malt\nis seldom brewed into less than two barrels of strong, and one barrel of\nsmall beer; frequently into two barrels and a-half of strong beer. The\ndifferent taxes upon small beer amount to one shilling and fourpence\na-barrel. In the country brewery, therefore, the different taxes upon\nmalt, beer, and ale, seldom amount to less than twenty-three shillings and\nfourpence, frequently to twenty-six shillings, upon the produce of a\nquarter of malt. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, therefore, the\nwhole amount of the duties upon malt, beer, and ale, cannot be estimated\nat less than twenty-four or twenty-five shillings upon the produce of a\nquarter of malt. But by taking off all the different duties upon beer and\nale, and by trebling the malt tax, or by raising it from six to eighteen\nshillings upon the quarter of malt, a greater revenue, it is said, might\nbe raised by this single tax, than what is at present drawn from all those\nheavier taxes.\nIn 1772, the old malt tax produced.........  \u00a3722,023: 11: 11\nThe additional... \u00a3356,776:  7:  9\u00be\nIn 1773, the old tax produced............... \u00a3561,627:  3:  7\u00bd\nThe additional... \u00a3278,650: 15:  3\u00be\nIn 1774, the old tax  produced ............. \u00a3624,614: 17:  5\u00be\nThe additional....\u00a3310,745:  2:  8\u00bd\nIn 1775, the old tax produced  ..............\u00a3657,357:  0:  8\u00bc\nThe additional....\u00a3323,785: 12:  6\u00bc\n4)\u00a33,835,580: 12:  0\u00be\nAverage of these four years ...............  \u00a3958,895:  3:  0\nIn 1772, the country excise produced.......\u00a31,243,120:  5:  3\nThe London brewery          408,260:  7:  2\u00be\nIn 1773, the country excise................\u00a31,245,808:  3:  3\nThe London brewery          405,406: 17: 10\u00bd\nIn 1774, the country excise................\u00a31,246,373: 14:  5\u00bd\nThe London brewery          320,601: 18:  0\u00bc\nIn 1775, the country excise................\u00a31,214,583:  6:  1\u00bc\nThe London brewery          463,670:  7:  0\u00bc\n4)\u00a36,547,832 19:  2\u00bc\nAverage of these four years ...............\u00a31,636,958:  4:  9\u00bd\nTo which adding the average malt tax........  958,895:  3:  0\u00bc\nThe whole amount of those different\ntaxes comes out to be........\u00a32,595,835:  7: 10\nBut, by trebling the malt tax,\nor by raising it from six to\neighteen shillings upon the quarter\nof malt, that single tax would produce.....\u00a32,876,685:  9:  0\nA sum which exceeds the\nforegoing by....       280,832:  1:  3\nUnder the old malt tax, indeed, is comprehended a tax of four shillings\nupon the hogshead of cyder, and another of ten shillings upon the barrel\nof mum. In 1774, the tax upon cyder produced only \u00a33,083:6:8. It probably\nfell somewhat short of its usual amount; all the different taxes upon\ncyder, having, that year, produced less than ordinary. The tax upon mum,\nthough much heavier, is still less productive, on account of the smaller\nconsumption of that liquor. But to balance whatever may be the ordinary\namount of those two taxes, there is comprehended under what is called the\ncountry excise, first, the old excise of six shillings and eightpence upon\nthe hogshead of cyder; secondly, a like tax of six shillings and\neightpence upon the hogshead of verjuice; thirdly, another of eight\nshillings and ninepence upon the hogshead of vinegar; and, lastly, a\nfourth tax of elevenpence upon the gallon of mead or metheglin. The\nproduce of those different taxes will probably much more than\ncounterbalance that of the duties imposed, by what is called the annual\nmalt tax, upon cyder and mum.\nMalt is consumed, not only in the brewery of beer and ale, but in the\nmanufacture of low wines and spirits. If the malt tax were to be raised to\neighteen shillings upon the quarter, it might be necessary to make some\nabatement in the different excises which are imposed upon those particular\nsorts of low wines and spirits, of which malt makes any part of the\nmaterials. In what are called malt spirits, it makes commonly but a third\npart of the materials; the other two-thirds being either raw barley, or\none-third barley and one-third wheat. In the distillery of malt spirits,\nboth the opportunity and the temptation to smuggle are much greater than\neither in a brewery or in a malt-house; the opportunity, on account of the\nsmaller bulk and greater value of the commodity, and the temptation, on\naccount of the superior height of the duties, which amounted to 3s. 10\n\u2154d. upon the gallon of spirits. {Though the duties directly imposed upon\nproof spirits amount only to 2s. 6d per gallon, these, added to the duties\nupon the low wines, from which they are distilled, amount to 3s 10 \u2154d.\nBoth low wines and proof spirits are, to prevent frauds, now rated\naccording to what they gauge in the wash.}\nBy increasing the duties upon malt, and reducing those upon the\ndistillery, both the opportunities and the temptation to smuggle would be\ndiminished, which might occasion a still further augmentation of revenue.\nIt has for some time past been the policy of Great Britain to discourage\nthe consumption of spiritous liquors, on account of their supposed\ntendency to ruin the health and to corrupt the morals of the common\npeople. According to this policy, the abatement of the taxes upon the\ndistillery ought not to be so great as to reduce, in any respect, the\nprice of those liquors. Spiritous liquors might remain as dear as ever;\nwhile, at the same time, the wholesome and invigorating liquors of beer\nand ale might be considerably reduced in their price. The people might\nthus be in part relieved from one of the burdens of which they at present\ncomplain the most; while, at the same time, the revenue might be\nconsiderably augmented.\nThe objections of Dr Davenant to this alteration in the present system of\nexcise duties, seem to be without foundation. Those objections are, that\nthe tax, instead of dividing itself, as at present, pretty equally upon\nthe profit of the maltster, upon that of the brewer and upon that of the\nretailer, would so far as it affected profit, fall altogether upon that of\nthe maltster; that the maltster could not so easily get back the amount of\nthe tax in the advanced price of his malt, as the brewer and retailer in\nthe advanced price of their liquor; and that so heavy a tax upon malt\nmight reduce the rent and profit of barley land.\nNo tax can ever reduce, for any considerable time, the rate of profit in\nany particular trade, which must always keep its level with other trades\nin the neighbourhood. The present duties upon malt, beer, and ale, do not\naffect the profits of the dealers in those commodities, who all get back\nthe tax with an additional profit, in the enhanced price of their goods. A\ntax, indeed, may render the goods upon which it is imposed so dear, as to\ndiminish the consumption of them. But the consumption of malt is in malt\nliquors; and a tax of eighteen shillings upon the quarter of malt could\nnot well render those liquors dearer than the different taxes, amounting\nto twenty-four or twenty-five shillings, do at present. Those liquors, on\nthe contrary, would probably become cheaper, and the consumption of them\nwould be more likely to increase than to diminish.\nIt is not very easy to understand why it should be more difficult for the\nmaltster to get back eighteen shillings in the advanced price of his malt,\nthan it is at present for the brewer to get back twenty-four or\ntwenty-five, sometimes thirty shillings, in that of his liquor. The\nmaltster, indeed, instead of a tax of six shillings, would be obliged to\nadvance one of eighteen shilling upon every quarter of malt. But the\nbrewer is at present obliged to advance a tax of twenty-four or\ntwenty-five, sometimes thirty shillings, upon every quarter of malt which\nhe brews. It could not be more inconvenient for the maltster to advance a\nlighter tax, than it is at present for the brewer to advance a heavier\none. The maltster does not always keep in his granaries a stock of malt,\nwhich it will require a longer time to dispose of than the stock of beer\nand ale which the brewer frequently keeps in his cellars. The former,\ntherefore, may frequently get the returns of his money as soon as the\nlatter. But whatever inconveniency might arise to the maltster from being\nobliged to advance a heavier tax, it could easily be remedied, by granting\nhim a few months longer credit than is at present commonly given to the\nbrewer.\nNothing could reduce the rent and profit of barley land, which did not\nreduce the demand for barley. But a change of system, which reduced the\nduties upon a quarter of malt brewed into beer and ale, from twenty-four\nand twenty-five shillings to eighteen shillings, would be more likely to\nincrease than diminish that demand. The rent and profit of barley land,\nbesides, must always be nearly equal to those of other equally fertile and\nequally well cultivated land. If they were less, some part of the barley\nland would soon be turned to some other purpose; and if they were greater,\nmore land would soon be turned to the raising of barley. When the ordinary\nprice of any particular produce of land is at what may be called a\nmonopoly price, a tax upon it necessarily reduces the rent and profit of\nthe land which grows it. A tax upon the produce of those precious\nvineyards, of which the wine falls so much short of the effectual demand,\nthat its price is always above the natural proportion to that of the\nproduce of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land, would\nnecessarily reduce the rent and profit of those vineyards. The price of\nthe wines being already the highest that could be got for the quantity\ncommonly sent to market, it could not be raised higher without diminishing\nthat quantity; and the quantity could not be diminished without still\ngreater loss, because the lands could not be turned to any other equally\nvaluable produce. The whole weight of the tax, therefore, would fall upon\nthe rent and profit; properly upon the rent of the vineyard. When it has\nbeen proposed to lay any new tax upon sugar, our sugar planters have\nfrequently complained that the whole weight of such taxes fell not upon\nthe consumer, but upon the producer; they never having been able to raise\nthe price of their sugar after the tax higher than it was before. The\nprice had, it seems, before the tax, been a monopoly price; and the\narguments adduced to show that sugar was an improper subject of taxation,\ndemonstrated perhaps that it was a proper one; the gains of monopolists,\nwhenever they can be come at, being certainly of all subjects the most\nproper. But the ordinary price of barley has never been a monopoly price;\nand the rent and profit of barley land have never been above their natural\nproportion to those of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated\nland. The different taxes which have been imposed upon malt, beer, and\nale, have never lowered the price of barley; have never reduced the rent\nand profit of barley land. The price of malt to the brewer has constantly\nrisen in proportion to the taxes imposed upon it; and those taxes,\ntogether with the different duties upon beer and ale, have constantly\neither raised the price, or, what comes to the same thing, reduced the\nquality of those commodities to the consumer. The final payment of those\ntaxes has fallen constantly upon the consumer, and not upon the producer.\nThe only people likely to suffer by the change of system here proposed,\nare those who brew for their own private use. But the exemption, which\nthis superior rank of people at present enjoy, from very heavy taxes which\nare paid by the poor labourer and artificer, is surely most unjust and\nunequal, and ought to be taken away, even though this change was never to\ntake place. It has probably been the interest of this superior order of\npeople, however, which has hitherto prevented a change of system that\ncould not well fail both to increase the revenue and to relieve the\npeople.\nBesides such duties as those of custom and excise above mentioned, there\nare several others which affect the price of goods more unequally and more\nindirectly. Of this kind are the duties, which, in French, are called\npeages, which in old Saxon times were called the duties of passage, and\nwhich seem to have been originally established for the same purpose as our\nturnpike tolls, or the tolls upon our canals and navigable rivers, for the\nmaintenance of the road or of the navigation. Those duties, when applied\nto such purposes, are most properly imposed according to the bulk or\nweight of the goods. As they were originally local and provincial duties,\napplicable to local and provincial purposes, the administration of them\nwas, in most cases, entrusted to the particular town, parish, or lordship,\nin which they were levied; such communities being, in some way or other,\nsupposed to be accountable for the application. The sovereign, who is\naltogether unaccountable, has in many countries assumed to himself the\nadministration of those duties; and though he has in most cases enhanced\nvery much the duty, he has in many entirely neglected the application. If\nthe turnpike tolls of Great Britain should ever become one of the\nresources of government, we may learn, by the example of many other\nnations, what would probably be the consequence. Such tolls, no doubt, are\nfinally paid by the consumer; but the consumer is not taxed in proportion\nto his expense, when he pays, not according to the value, but according to\nthe bulk or weight of what he consumes. When such duties are imposed, not\naccording to the bulk or weight, but according to the supposed value of\nthe goods, they become properly a sort of inland customs or excise, which\nobstruct very much the most important of all branches of commerce, the\ninterior commerce of the country.\nIn some small states, duties similar to those passage duties are imposed\nupon goods carried across the territory, either by land or by water, from\none foreign country to another. These are in some countries called\ntransit-duties. Some of the little Italian states which are situated upon\nthe Po, and the rivers which run into it, derive some revenue from duties\nof this kind, which are paid altogether by foreigners, and which, perhaps,\nare the only duties that one state can impose upon the subjects of\nanother, without obstruction in any respect, the industry or commerce of\nits own. The most important transit-duty in the world, is that levied by\nthe king of Denmark upon all merchant ships which pass through the Sound.\nSuch taxes upon luxuries, as the greater part of the duties of customs and\nexcise, though they all fall indifferently upon every different species of\nrevenue, and are paid finally, or without any retribution, by whoever\nconsumes the commodities upon which they are imposed; yet they do not\nalways fall equally or proportionally upon the revenue of every\nindividual. As every man\u2019s humour regulates the degree of his consumption,\nevery man contributes rather according to his humour, than proportion to\nhis revenue: the profuse contribute more, the parsimonious less, than\ntheir proper proportion. During the minority of a man of great fortune, he\ncontributes commonly very little, by his consumption, towards the support\nof that state from whose protection he derives a great revenue. Those who\nlive in another country, contribute nothing by their consumption towards\nthe support of the government of that country, in which is situated the\nsource of their revenue. If in this latter country there should be no land\ntax, nor any considerable duty upon the transference either of moveable or\nimmoveable property, as is the case in Ireland, such absentees may derive\na great revenue from the protection of a government, to the support of\nwhich they do not contribute a single shilling. This inequality is likely\nto be greatest in a country of which the government is, in some respects,\nsubordinate and dependant upon that of some other. The people who possess\nthe most extensive property in the dependant, will, in this case,\ngenerally chuse to live in the governing country. Ireland is precisely in\nthis situation; and we cannot therefore wonder, that the proposal of a tax\nupon absentees should be so very popular in that country. It might,\nperhaps, be a little difficult to ascertain either what sort, or what\ndegree of absence, would subject a man to be taxed as an absentee, or at\nwhat precise time the tax should either begin or end. If you except,\nhowever, this very peculiar situation, any inequality in the contribution\nof individuals which can arise from such taxes, is much more than\ncompensated by the very circumstance which occasions that inequality; the\ncircumstance that every man\u2019s contribution is altogether voluntary; it\nbeing altogether in his power, either to consume, or not to consume, the\ncommodity taxed. Where such taxes, therefore, are properly assessed, and\nupon proper commodities, they are paid with less grumbling than any other.\nWhen they are advanced by the merchant or manufacturer, the consumer, who\nfinally pays them, soon comes to confound them with the price of the\ncommodities, and almost forgets that he pays any tax. Such taxes are, or\nmay be, perfectly certain; or may be assessed, so as to leave no doubt\nconcerning either what ought to be paid, or when it ought to be paid;\nconcerning either the quantity or the time of payment. What ever\nuncertainty there may sometimes be, either in the duties of customs in\nGreat Britain, or in other duties of the same kind in other countries, it\ncannot arise from the nature of those duties, but from the inaccurate or\nunskilful manner in which the law that imposes them is expressed.\nTaxes upon luxuries generally are, and always may be, paid piece-meal, or\nin proportion as the contributors have occasion to purchase the goods upon\nwhich they are imposed. In the time and mode of payment, they are, or may\nbe, of all taxes the most convenient. Upon the whole, such taxes,\ntherefore, are perhaps as agreeable to the three first of the four general\nmaxims concerning taxation, as any other. They offend in every respect\nagainst the fourth.\nSuch taxes, in proportion to what they bring into the public treasury of\nthe state, always take out, or keep out, of the pockets of the people,\nmore than almost any other taxes. They seem to do this in all the four\ndifferent ways in which it is possible to do it.\nFirst, the levying of such taxes, even when imposed in the most judicious\nmanner, requires a great number of custom-house and excise officers, whose\nsalaries and perquisites are a real tax upon the people, which brings\nnothing into the treasury of the state. This expense, however, it must be\nacknowledged, is more moderate in Great Britain than in most other\ncountries. In the year which ended on the 5th of July, 1775, the gross\nproduce of the different duties, under the management of the commissioners\nof excise in England, amounted to \u00a35,507,308:18:8\u00bc, which was levied at an\nexpense of little more than five and a-half per cent. From this gross\nproduce, however, there must be deducted what was paid away in bounties\nand drawbacks upon the exportation of exciseable goods, which will reduce\nthe neat produce below five millions. {The neat produce of that year,\nafter deducting all expenses and allowances, amounted to \u00a34,975,652:19:6.}\nThe levying of the salt duty, and excise duty, but under a different\nmanagement, is much more expensive. The neat revenue of the customs does\nnot amount to two millions and a-half, which is levied at an expense of\nmore than ten per cent., in the salaries of officers and other incidents.\nBut the perquisites of custom-house officers are everywhere much greater\nthan their salaries; at some ports more than double or triple those\nsalaries. If the salaries of officers, and other incidents, therefore,\namount to more than ten per cent. upon the neat revenue of the customs,\nthe whole expense of levying that revenue may amount, in salaries and\nperquisites together, to more than twenty or thirty per cent. The officers\nof excise receive few or no perquisites; and the administration of that\nbranch of the revenue being of more recent establishment, is in general\nless corrupted than that of the customs, into which length of time has\nintroduced and authorised many abuses. By charging upon malt the whole\nrevenue which is at present levied by the different duties upon malt and\nmalt liquors, a saving, it is supposed, of more than \u00a350,000, might be\nmade in the annual expense of the excise. By confining the duties of\ncustoms to a few sorts of goods, and by levying those duties according to\nthe excise laws, a much greater saving might probably be made in the\nannual expense of the customs.\nSecondly, such taxes necessarily occasion some obstruction or\ndiscouragement to certain branches of industry. As they always raise the\nprice of the commodity taxed, they so far discourage its consumption, and\nconsequently its production. If it is a commodity of home growth or\nmanufacture, less labour comes to be employed in raising and producing it.\nIf it is a foreign commodity of which the tax increases in this manner the\nprice, the commodities of the same kind which are made at home may\nthereby, indeed, gain some advantage in the home market, and a greater\nquantity of domestic industry may thereby be turned toward preparing them.\nBut though this rise of price in a foreign commodity, may encourage\ndomestic industry in one particular branch, it necessarily discourages\nthat industry in almost every other. The dearer the Birmingham\nmanufacturer buys his foreign wine, the cheaper he necessarily sells that\npart of his hardware with which, or, what comes to the same thing, with\nthe price of which, he buys it. That part of his hardware, therefore,\nbecomes of less value to him, and he has less encouragement to work at it.\nThe dearer the consumers in one country pay for the surplus produce of\nanother, the cheaper they necessarily sell that part of their own surplus\nproduce with which, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of\nwhich, they buy it. That part of their own surplus produce becomes of less\nvalue to them, and they have less encouragement to increase its quantity.\nAll taxes upon consumable commodities, therefore, tend to reduce the\nquantity of productive labour below what it otherwise would be, either in\npreparing the commodities taxed, if they are home commodities, or in\npreparing those with which they are purchased, if they are foreign\ncommodities. Such taxes, too, always alter, more or less, the natural\ndirection of national industry, and turn it into a channel always\ndifferent from, and generally less advantageous, than that in which it\nwould have run of its own accord.\nThirdly, the hope of evading such taxes by smuggling, gives frequent\noccasion to forfeitures and other penalties, which entirely ruin the\nsmuggler; a person who, though no doubt highly blameable for violating the\nlaws of his country, is frequently incapable of violating those of natural\njustice, and would have been, in every respect, an excellent citizen, had\nnot the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to\nbe so. In those corrupted governments, where there is at least a general\nsuspicion of much unnecessary expense, and great misapplication of the\npublic revenue, the laws which guard it are little respected. Not many\npeople are scrupulous about smuggling, when, without perjury, they can\nfind an easy and safe opportunity of doing so. To pretend to have any\nscruple about buying smuggled goods, though a manifest encouragement to\nthe violation of the revenue laws, and to the perjury which almost always\nattends it, would, in most countries, be regarded as one of those pedantic\npieces of hypocrisy which, instead of gaining credit with anybody, serve\nonly to expose the person who affects to practise them to the suspicion of\nbeing a greater knave than most of his neighbours. By this indulgence of\nthe public, the smuggler is often encouraged to continue a trade, which he\nis thus taught to consider as in some measure innocent; and when the\nseverity of the revenue laws is ready to fall upon him, he is frequently\ndisposed to defend with violence, what he has been accustomed to regard as\nhis just property. From being at first, perhaps, rather imprudent than\ncriminal, he at last too often becomes one of the hardiest and most\ndetermined violators of the laws of society. By the ruin of the smuggler,\nhis capital, which had before been employed in maintaining productive\nlabour, is absorbed either in the revenue of the state, or in that of the\nrevenue officer; and is employed in maintaining unproductive, to the\ndiminution of the general capital of the society, and of the useful\nindustry which it might otherwise have maintained.\nFourthly, such taxes, by subjecting at least the dealers in the taxed\ncommodities, to the frequent visits and odious examination of the\ntax-gatherers, expose them sometimes, no doubt, to some degree of\noppression, and always to much trouble and vexation; and though vexation,\nas has already been said, is not strictly speaking expense, it is\ncertainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing to\nredeem himself from it. The laws of excise, though more effectual for the\npurpose for which they were instituted, are, in this respect, more\nvexatious than those of the customs. When a merchant has imported goods\nsubject to certain duties of customs; when he has paid those duties, and\nlodged the goods in his warehouse; he is not, in most cases, liable to any\nfurther trouble or vexation from the custom-house officer. It is otherwise\nwith goods subject to duties of excise. The dealers have no respite from\nthe continual visits and examination of the excise officers. The duties of\nexcise are, upon this account, more unpopular than those of the customs;\nand so are the officers who levy them. Those officers, it is pretended,\nthough in general, perhaps, they do their duty fully as well as those of\nthe customs; yet, as that duty obliges them to be frequently very\ntroublesome to some of their neighbours, commonly contract a certain\nhardness of character, which the others frequently have not. This\nobservation, however, may very probably be the mere suggestion of\nfraudulent dealers, whose smuggling is either prevented or detected by\ntheir diligence.\nThe inconveniencies, however, which are, perhaps, in some degree\ninseparable from taxes upon consumable communities, fall as light upon the\npeople of Great Britain as upon those of any other country of which the\ngovernment is nearly as expensive. Our state is not perfect, and might be\nmended; but it is as good, or better, than that of most of our neighbours.\nIn consequence of the notion, that duties upon consumable goods were taxes\nupon the profits of merchants, those duties have, in some countries, been\nrepeated upon every successive sale of the goods. If the profits of the\nmerchant-importer or merchant-manufacturer were taxed, equality seemed to\nrequire that those of all the middle buyers, who intervened between either\nof them and the consumer, should likewise be taxed. The famous alcavala of\nSpain seems to have been established upon this principle. It was at first\na tax of ten per cent. afterwards of fourteen per cent. and it is at\npresent only six per cent. upon the sale of every sort of property whether\nmoveable or immoveable; and it is repeated every time the property is\nsold. {Memoires concernant les Droits, etc. tom. i, p. 15} The levying of\nthis tax requires a multitude of revenue officers, sufficient to guard the\ntransportation of goods, not only from one province to another, but from\none shop to another. It subjects, not only the dealers in some sorts of\ngoods, but those in all sorts, every farmer, every manufacturer, every\nmerchant and shopkeeper, to the continual visit and examination of the\ntax-gatherers. Through the greater part of the country in which a tax of\nthis kind is established, nothing can be produced for distant sale. The\nproduce of every part of the country must be proportioned to the\nconsumption of the neighbourhood. It is to the alcavala, accordingly, that\nUstaritz imputes the ruin of the manufactures of Spain. He might have\nimputed to it, likewise, the declension of agriculture, it being imposed\nnot only upon manufactures, but upon the rude produce of the land.\nIn the kingdom of Naples, there is a similar tax of three per cent. upon\nthe value of all contracts, and consequently upon that of all contracts of\nsale. It is both lighter than the Spanish tax, and the greater part of\ntowns and parishes are allowed to pay a composition in lieu of it. They\nlevy this composition in what manner they please, generally in a way that\ngives no interruption to the interior commerce of the place. The\nNeapolitan tax, therefore, is not near so ruinous as the Spanish one.\nThe uniform system of taxation, which, with a few exception of no great\nconsequence, takes place in all the different parts of the united kingdom\nof Great Britain, leaves the interior commerce of the country, the inland\nand coasting trade, almost entirely free. The inland trade is almost\nperfectly free; and the greater part of goods may be carried from one end\nof the kingdom to the other, without requiring any permit or let-pass,\nwithout being subject to question, visit or examination, from the revenue\nofficers. There are a few exceptions, but they are such as can give no\ninterruption to any important branch of inland commerce of the country.\nGoods carried coastwise, indeed, require certificates or coast-cockets. If\nyou except coals, however, the rest are almost all duty-free. This freedom\nof interior commerce, the effect of the uniformity of the system of\ntaxation, is perhaps one of the principal causes of the prosperity of\nGreat Britain; every great country being necessarily the best and most\nextensive market for the greater part of the productions of its own\nindustry. If the same freedom in consequence of the same uniformity, could\nbe extended to Ireland and the plantations, both the grandeur of the\nstate, and the prosperity of every part of the empire, would probably be\nstill greater than at present.\nIn France, the different revenue laws which take place in the different\nprovinces, require a multitude of revenue officers to surround, not only\nthe frontiers of the kingdom, but those of almost each particular\nprovince, in order either to prevent the importation of certain goods, or\nto subject it to the payment of certain duties, to the no small\ninterruption of the interior commerce of the country. Some provinces are\nallowed to compound for the gabelle, or salt tax; others are exempted from\nit altogether. Some provinces are exempted from the exclusive sale of\ntobacco, which the farmers-general enjoy through the greater part of the\nkingdom. The aides, which correspond to the excise in England, are very\ndifferent in different provinces. Some provinces are exempted from them,\nand pay a composition or equivalent. In those in which they take place,\nand are in farm, there are many local duties which do not extend beyond a\nparticular town or district. The traites, which correspond to our customs,\ndivide the kingdom into three great parts; first, the provinces subject to\nthe tariff of 1664, which are called the provinces of the five great\nfarms, and under which are comprehended Picardy, Normandy, and the greater\npart of the interior provinces of the kingdom; secondly, the provinces\nsubject to the tariff of 1667, which are called the provinces reckoned\nforeign, and under which are comprehended the greater part of the frontier\nprovinces; and, thirdly, those provinces which are said to be treated as\nforeign, or which, because they are allowed a free commerce with foreign\ncountries, are, in their commerce with the other provinces of France,\nsubjected to the same duties as other foreign countries. These are Alsace,\nthe three bishoprics of Mentz, Toul, and Verdun, and the three cities of\nDunkirk, Bayonne, and Marseilles. Both in the provinces of the five great\nfarms (called so on account of an ancient division of the duties of\ncustoms into five great branches, each of which was originally the subject\nof a particular farm, though they are now all united into one), and in\nthose which are said to be reckoned foreign, there are many local duties\nwhich do not extend beyond a particular town or district. There are some\nsuch even in the provinces which are said to be treated as foreign,\nparticularly in the city of Marseilles. It is unnecessary to observe how\nmuch both the restraints upon the interior commerce of the country, and\nthe number of the revenue officers, must be multiplied, in order to guard\nthe frontiers of those different provinces and districts which are subject\nto such different systems of taxation.\nOver and above the general restraints arising from this complicated system\nof revenue laws, the commerce of wine (after corn, perhaps, the most\nimportant production of France) is, in the greater part of the provinces,\nsubject to particular restraints arising from the favour which has been\nshown to the vineyards of particular provinces and districts above those\nof others. The provinces most famous for their wines, it will be found, I\nbelieve, are those in which the trade in that article is subject to the\nfewest restraints of this kind. The extensive market which such provinces\nenjoy, encourages good management both in the cultivation of their\nvineyards, and in the subsequent preparation of their wines.\nSuch various and complicated revenue laws are not peculiar to France. The\nlittle duchy of Milan is divided into six provinces, in each of which\nthere is a different system of taxation, with regard to several different\nsorts of consumable goods. The still smaller territories of the duke of\nParma are divided into three or four, each of which has, in the same\nmanner, a system of its own. Under such absurd management, nothing but the\ngreat fertility of the soil, and happiness of the climate, could preserve\nsuch countries from soon relapsing into the lowest state of poverty and\nbarbarism.\nTaxes upon consumable commodities may either be levied by an\nadministration, of which the officers are appointed by govermnent, and are\nimmediately accountable to government, of which the revenue must, in this\ncase, vary from year to year, according to the occasional variations in\nthe produce of the tax; or they may be let in farm for a rent certain, the\nfarmer being allowed to appoint his own officers, who, though obliged to\nlevy the tax in the manner directed by the law, are under his immediate\ninspection, and are immediately accountable to him. The best and most\nfrugal way of levying a tax can never be by farm. Over and above what is\nnecessary for paying the stipulated rent, the salaries of the officers,\nand the whole expense of administration, the farmer must always draw from\nthe produce of the tax a certain profit, proportioned at least to the\nadvance which he makes, to the risk which he runs, to the trouble which he\nis at, and to the knowledge and skill which it requires to manage so very\ncomplicated a concern. Government, by establishing an administration under\ntheir own immediate inspection, of the same kind with that which the\nfarmer establishes, might at least save this profit, which is almost\nalways exorbitant. To farm any considerable branch of the public revenue\nrequires either a great capital, or a great credit; circumstances which\nwould alone restrain the competition for such an undertaking to a very\nsmall number of people. Of the few who have this capital or credit, a\nstill smaller number have the necessary knowledge or experience; another\ncircumstance which restrains the competition still further. The very few\nwho are in condition to become competitors, find it more for their\ninterest to combine together; to become copartners, instead of\ncompetitors; and, when the farm is set up to auction, to offer no rent but\nwhat is much below the real value. In countries where the public revenues\nare in farm, the farmers are generally the most opulent people. Their\nwealth would alone excite the public indignation; and the vanity which\nalmost always accompanies such upstart fortunes, the foolish ostentation\nwith which they commonly display that wealth, excite that indignation\nstill more.\nThe farmers of the public revenue never find the laws too severe, which\npunish any attempt to evade the payment of a tax. They have no bowels for\nthe contributors, who are not their subjects, and whose universal\nbankruptcy, if it should happen the day after the farm is expired, would\nnot much affect their interest. In the greatest exigencies of the state,\nwhen the anxiety of the sovereign for the exact payment of his revenue is\nnecessarily the greatest, they seldom fail to complain, that without laws\nmore rigorous than those which actually took place, it will be impossible\nfor them to pay even the usual rent. In those moments of public distress,\ntheir commands cannot be disputed. The revenue laws, therefore, become\ngradually more and more severe. The most sanguinary are always to be found\nin countries where the greater part of the public revenue is in farm; the\nmildest, in countries where it is levied under the immediate inspection of\nthe sovereign. Even a bad sovereign feels more compassion for his people\nthan can ever be expected from the farmers of his revenue. He knows that\nthe permanent grandeur of his family depends upon the prosperity of his\npeople, and he will never knowingly ruin that prosperity for the sake of\nany momentary interest of his own. It is otherwise with the farmers of his\nrevenue, whose grandeur may frequently be the effect of the ruin, and not\nof the prosperity, of his people.\nA tax is sometimes not only farmed for a certain rent, but the farmer has,\nbesides, the monopoly of the commodity taxed. In France, the duties upon\ntobacco and salt are levied in this manner. In such cases, the farmer,\ninstead of one, levies two exorbitant profits upon the people; the profit\nof the farmer, and the still more exorbitant one of the monopolist.\nTobacco being a luxury, every man is allowed to buy or not to buy as he\nchuses; but salt being a necessary, every man is obliged to buy of the\nfarmer a certain quantity of it; because, if he did not buy this quantity\nof the farmer, he would, it is presumed, buy it of some smuggler. The\ntaxes upon both commodities are exorbitant. The temptation to smuggle,\nconsequently, is to many people irresistible; while, at the same time, the\nrigour of the law, and the vigilance of the farmer\u2019s officers, render the\nyielding to the temptation almost certainly ruinous. The smuggling of salt\nand tobacco sends every year several hundred people to the galleys,\nbesides a very considerable number whom it sends to the gibbet. Those\ntaxes, levied in this manner, yield a very considerable revenue to\ngovernment. In 1767, the farm of tobacco was let for twenty-two millions\nfive hundred and forty-one thousand two hundred and seventy-eight livres\na-year; that of salt for thirty-six millions four hundred and ninety-two\nthousand four hundred and four livres. The farm, in both cases, was to\ncommence in 1768, and to last for six years. Those who consider the blood\nof the people as nothing, in comparison with the revenue of the prince,\nmay, perhaps, approve of this method of levying taxes. Similar taxes and\nmonopolies of salt and tobacco have been established in many other\ncountries, particularly in the Austrian and Prussian dominions, and in the\ngreater part of the states of Italy.\nIn France, the greater part of the actual revenue of the crown is derived\nfrom eight different sources; the taille, the capitation, the two\nvingtiemes, the gabelles, the aides, the traites, the domaine, and the\nfarm of tobacco. The five last are, in the greater part of the provinces,\nunder farm. The three first are everywhere levied by an administration,\nunder the immediate inspection and direction of government; and it is\nuniversally acknowledged, that in proportion to what they take out of the\npockets of the people, they bring more into the treasury of the prince\nthan the other five, of which the administration is much more wasteful and\nexpensive.\nThe finances of France seem, in their present state, to admit of three\nvery obvious reformations. First, by abolishing the taille and the\ncapitation, and by increasing the number of the vingtiemes, so as to\nproduce an additional revenue equal to the amount of those other taxes,\nthe revenue of the crown might be preserved; the expense of collection\nmight be much diminished; the vexation of the inferior ranks of people,\nwhich the taille and capitation occasion, might be entirely prevented; and\nthe superior ranks might not be more burdened than the greater part of\nthem are at present. The vingtieme, I have already observed, is a tax very\nnearly of the same kind with what is called the land tax of England. The\nburden of the taille, it is acknowledged, falls finally upon the\nproprietors of land; and as the greater part of the capitation is assessed\nupon those who are subject to the taille, at so much a-pound of that other\ntax, the final payment of the greater part of it must likewise fall upon\nthe same order of people. Though the number of the vingtiemes, therefore,\nwas increased, so as to produce an additional revenue equal to the amount\nof both those taxes, the superior ranks of people might not be more\nburdened than they are at present; many individuals, no doubt, would, on\naccount of the great inequalities with which the taille is commonly\nassessed upon the estates and tenants of different individuals. The\ninterest and opposition of such favoured subjects, are the obstacles most\nlikely to prevent this, or any other reformation of the same kind.\nSecondly, by rendering the gabelle, the aides, the traites, the taxes upon\ntobacco, all the different customs and excises, uniform in all the\ndifferent parts of the kingdom, those taxes might be levied at much less\nexpense, and the interior commerce of the kingdom might be rendered as\nfree as that of England. Thirdly, and lastly, by subjecting all those\ntaxes to an administration under the immediate inspection and direction or\ngovernment, the exorbitant profits of the farmers-general might be added\nto the revenue of the state. The opposition arising from the private\ninterest of individuals, is likely to be as effectual for preventing the\ntwo last as the first-mentioned scheme of reformation.\nThe French system of taxation seems, in every respect, inferior to the\nBritish. In Great Britain, ten millions sterling are annually levied upon\nless than eight millions of people, without its being possible to say that\nany particular order is oppressed. From the Collections of the Abb\u00e9\nExpilly, and the observations of the author of the Essay upon the\nLegislation and Commerce of Corn, it appears probable that France,\nincluding the provinces of Lorraine and Bar, contains about twenty-three\nor twenty-four millions of people; three times the number, perhaps,\ncontained in Great Britain. The soil and climate of France are better than\nthose of Great Britain. The country has been much longer in a state of\nimprovement and cultivation, and is, upon that account, better stocked\nwith all those things which it requires a long time to raise up and\naccumulate; such as great towns, and convenient and well-built houses,\nboth in town and country. With these advantages, it might be expected,\nthat in France a revenue of thirty millions might be levied for the\nsupport of the state, with as little inconvenience as a revenue of ten\nmillions is in Great Britain. In 1765 and 1766, the whole revenue paid\ninto the treasury of France, according to the best, though, I acknowledge,\nvery imperfect accounts which I could get of it, usually run between 308\nand 325 millions of livres; that is, it did not amount to fifteen millions\nsterling; not the half of what might have been expected, had the people\ncontributed in the same proportion to their numbers as the people of Great\nBritain. The people of France, however, it is generally acknowledged, are\nmuch more oppressed by taxes than the people of Great Britain. France,\nhowever, is certainly the great empire in Europe, which, after that of\nGreat Britain, enjoys the mildest and most indulgent government.\nIn Holland, the heavy taxes upon the necessaries of life have ruined, it\nis said, their principal manufacturers, and are likely to discourage,\ngradually, even their fisheries and their trade in ship-building. The\ntaxes upon the necessaries of life are inconsiderable in Great Britain,\nand no manufacture has hitherto been ruined by them. The British taxes\nwhich bear hardest on manufactures, are some duties upon the importation\nof raw materials, particularly upon that of raw silk. The revenue of the\nStates-General and of the different cities, however, is said to amount to\nmore than five millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling;\nand as the inhabitants of the United Provinces cannot well be supposed to\namount to more than a third part of those of Great Britain, they must, in\nproportion to their number, be much more heavily taxed.\nAfter all the proper subjects of taxation have been exhausted, if the\nexigencies of the state still continue to require new taxes, they must be\nimposed upon improper ones. The taxes upon the necessaries of life,\ntherefore, may be no impeachment of the wisdom of that republic, which, in\norder to acquire and to maintain its independency, has, in spite of its\ngreat frugality, been involved in such expensive wars as have obliged it to\ncontract great debts. The singular countries of Holland and Zealand,\nbesides, require a considerable expense even to preserve their existence,\nor to prevent their being swallowed up by the sea, which must have\ncontributed to increase considerably the load of taxes in those two\nprovinces. The republican form of government seems to be the principal\nsupport of the present grandeur of Holland. The owners of great capitals,\nthe great mercantile families, have generally either some direct share, or\nsome indirect influence, in the administration of that government. For the\nsake of the respect and authority which they derive from this situation,\nthey are willing to live in a country where their capital, if they employ\nit themselves, will bring them less profit, and if they lend it to\nanother, less interest; and where the very moderate revenue which they can\ndraw from it will purchase less of the necessaries and conveniencies of\nlife than in any other part of Europe. The residence of such wealthy\npeople necessarily keeps alive, in spite of all disadvantages, a certain\ndegree of industry in the country. Any public calamity which should\ndestroy the republican form of government, which should throw the whole\nadministration into the hands of nobles and of soldiers, which should\nannihilate altogether the importance of those wealthy merchants, would\nsoon render it disagreeable to them to live in a country where they were\nno longer likely to be much respected. They would remove both their\nresidence and their capital to some other country, and the industry and\ncommerce of Holland would soon follow the capitals which supported them.\nCHAPTER III.\nOF PUBLIC DEBTS.\nIn that rude state of society which precedes the extension of commerce and\nthe improvement of manufactures; when those expensive luxuries, which\ncommerce and manufactures can alone introduce, are altogether unknown; the\nperson who possesses a large revenue, I have endeavoured to show in the\nthird book of this Inquiry, can spend or enjoy that revenue in no other\nway than by maintaining nearly as many people as it can maintain. A large\nrevenue may at all times be said to consist in the command of a large\nquantity of the necessaries of life. In that rude state of things, it is\ncommonly paid in a large quantity of those necessaries, in the materials\nof plain food and coarse clothing, in corn and cattle, in wool and raw\nhides. When neither commerce nor manufactures furnish any thing for which\nthe owner can exchange the greater part of those materials which are over\nand above his own consumption, he can do nothing with the surplus, but\nfeed and clothe nearly as many people as it will feed and clothe. A\nhospitality in which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there\nis no ostentation, occasion, in this situation of things, the principal\nexpenses of the rich and the great. But these I have likewise endeavoured\nto show, in the same book, are expenses by which people are not very apt\nto ruin themselves. There is not, perhaps, any selfish pleasure so\nfrivolous, of which the pursuit has not sometimes ruined even sensible\nmen. A passion for cock-fighting has ruined many. But the instances, I\nbelieve, are not very numerous, of people who have been ruined by a\nhospitality or liberality of this kind; though the hospitality of luxury,\nand the liberality of ostentation have ruined many. Among our feudal\nancestors, the long time during which estates used to continue in the same\nfamily, sufficiently demonstrates the general disposition of people to\nlive within their income. Though the rustic hospitality, constantly\nexercised by the great landholders, may not, to us in the present times,\nseem consistent with that order which we are apt to consider as\ninseparably connected with good economy; yet we must certainly allow them\nto have been at least so far frugal, as not commonly to have spent their\nwhole income. A part of their wool and raw hides, they had generally an\nopportunity of selling for money. Some part of this money, perhaps, they\nspent in purchasing the few objects of vanity and luxury, with which the\ncircumstances of the times could furnish them; but some part of it they\nseem commonly to have hoarded. They could not well, indeed, do any thing\nelse but hoard whatever money they saved. To trade, was disgraceful to a\ngentleman; and to lend money at interest, which at that time was\nconsidered as usury, and prohibited by law, would have been still more so.\nIn those times of violence and disorder, besides, it was convenient to\nhave a hoard of money at hand, that in case they should be driven from\ntheir own home, they might have something of known value to carry with\nthem to some place of safety. The same violence which made it convenient\nto hoard, made it equally convenient to conceal the hoard. The frequency\nof treasure-trove, or of treasure found, of which no owner was known,\nsufficiently demonstrates the frequency, in those times, both of hoarding\nand of concealing the hoard. Treasure-trove was then considered as an\nimportant branch of the revenue of the sovereign. All the treasure-trove\nof the kingdom would scarce, perhaps, in the present times, make an\nimportant branch of the revenue of a private gentleman of a good estate.\nThe same disposition, to save and to hoard, prevailed in the sovereign, as\nwell as in the subjects. Among nations, to whom commerce and manufacture\nare little known, the sovereign, it has already been observed in the\nFourth book, is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the\nparsimony requisite for accumulation. In that situation, the expense, even\nof a sovereign, cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the\ngaudy finery of a court. The ignorance of the times affords but few of the\ntrinkets in which that finery consists. Standing armies are not then\nnecessary; so that the expense, even of a sovereign, like that of any\nother great lord can be employed in scarce any thing but bounty to his\ntenants, and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and hospitality very\nseldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almost always does. All the\nancient sovereigns of Europe, accordingly, it has already been observed,\nhad treasures. Every Tartar chief, in the present times, is said to have\none.\nIn a commercial country, abounding with every sort of expensive luxury,\nthe sovereign, in the same manner as almost all the great proprietors in\nhis dominions, naturally spends a great part of his revenue in purchasing\nthose luxuries. His own and the neighbouring countries supply him\nabundantly with all the costly trinkets which compose the splendid, but\ninsignificant, pageantry of a court. For the sake of an inferior pageantry\nof the same kind, his nobles dismiss their retainers, make their tenants\nindependent, and become gradually themselves as insignificant as the\ngreater part of the wealthy burghers in his dominions. The same frivolous\npassions, which influence their conduct, influence his. How can it be\nsupposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is\ninsensible to pleasures of this kind? If he does not, what he is very\nlikely to do, spend upon those pleasures so great a part of his revenue as\nto debilitate very much the defensive power of the state, it cannot well\nbe expected that he should not spend upon them all that part of it which\nis over and above what is necessary for supporting that defensive power.\nHis ordinary expense becomes equal to his ordinary revenue, and it is well\nif it does not frequently exceed it. The amassing of treasure can no\nlonger be expected; and when extraordinary exigencies require\nextraordinary expenses, he must necessarily call upon his subjects for an\nextraordinary aid. The present and the late king of Prussia are the only\ngreat princes of Europe, who, since the death of Henry IV. of France, in\n1610, are supposed to have amassed any considerable treasure. The\nparsimony which leads to accumulation has become almost as rare in\nrepublican as in monarchical governments. The Italian republics, the\nUnited Provinces of the Netherlands, are all in debt. The canton of Berne\nis the single republic in Europe which has amassed any considerable\ntreasure. The other Swiss republics have not. The taste for some sort of\npageantry, for splendid buildings, at least, and other public ornaments,\nfrequently prevails as much in the apparently sober senate-house of a\nlittle republic, as in the dissipated court of the greatest king.\nThe want of parsimony, in time of peace, imposes the necessity of\ncontracting debt in time of war. When war comes, there is no money in the\ntreasury, but what is necessary for carrying on the ordinary expense of\nthe peace establishment. In war, an establishment of three or four times\nthat expense becomes necessary for the defence of the state; and\nconsequently, a revenue three or four times greater than the peace\nrevenue. Supposing that the sovereign should have, what he scarce ever\nhas, the immediate means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the\naugmentation of his expense; yet still the produce of the taxes, from\nwhich this increase of revenue must be drawn, will not begin to come into\nthe treasury, till perhaps ten or twelve months after they are imposed.\nBut the moment in which war begins, or rather the moment in which it\nappears likely to begin, the army must be augmented, the fleet must be\nfitted out, the garrisoned towns must be put into a posture of defence;\nthat army, that fleet, those garrisoned towns, must be furnished with\narms, ammunition, and provisions. An immediate and great expense must be\nincurred in that moment of immediate danger, which will not wait for the\ngradual and slow returns of the new taxes. In this exigency, government\ncan have no other resource but in borrowing.\nThe same commercial state of society which, by the operation of moral\ncauses, brings government in this manner into the necessity of borrowing,\nproduces in the subjects both an ability and an inclination to lend. If it\ncommonly brings along with it the necessity of borrowing, it likewise\nbrings with it the facility of doing so.\nA country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, necessarily abounds\nwith a set of people through whose hands, not only their own capitals, but\nthe capitals of all those who either lend them money, or trust them with\ngoods, pass as frequently, or more frequently, than the revenue of a\nprivate man, who, without trade or business, lives upon his income, passes\nthrough his hands. The revenue of such a man can regularly pass through\nhis hands only once in a year. But the whole amount of the capital and\ncredit of a merchant, who deals in a trade of which the returns are very\nquick, may sometimes pass through his hands two, three, or four times in a\nyear. A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, therefore,\nnecessarily abounds with a set of people, who have it at all times in\ntheir power to advance, if they chuse to do so, a very large sum of money\nto government. Hence the ability in the subjects of a commercial state to\nlend.\nCommerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does\nnot enjoy a regular administration of justice; in which the people do not\nfeel themselves secure in the possession of their property; in which the\nfaith of contracts is not supported by law; and in which the authority of\nthe state is not supposed to be regularly employed in enforcing the\npayment of debts from all those who are able to pay. Commerce and\nmanufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state, in which there\nis not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government. The\nsame confidence which disposes great merchants and manufacturers upon\nordinary occasions, to trust their property to the protection of a\nparticular government, disposes them, upon extraordinary occasions, to\ntrust that government with the use of their property. By lending money to\ngovernment, they do not even for a moment diminish their ability to carry\non their trade and manufactures; on the contrary, they commonly augment\nit. The necessities of the state render government, upon most occasions\nwilling to borrow upon terms extremely advantageous to the lender. The\nsecurity which it grants to the original creditor, is made transferable to\nany other creditor; and from the universal confidence in the justice of\nthe state, generally sells in the market for more than was originally paid\nfor it. The merchant or monied man makes money by lending money to\ngovernment, and instead of diminishing, increases his trading capital. He\ngenerally considers it as a favour, therefore, when the administration\nadmits him to a share in the first subscription for a new loan. Hence the\ninclination or willingness in the subjects of a commercial state to lend.\nThe government of such a state is very apt to repose itself upon this\nability and willingness of its subjects to lend it their money on\nextraordinary occasions. It foresees the facility of borrowing, and\ntherefore dispenses itself from the duty of saving.\nIn a rude state of society, there are no great mercantile or manufacturing\ncapitals. The individuals, who hoard whatever money they can save, and who\nconceal their hoard, do so from a distrust of the justice of government;\nfrom a fear, that if it was known that they had a hoard, and where that\nhoard was to be found, they would quickly be plundered. In such a state of\nthings, few people would be able, and nobody would be willing to lend\ntheir money to government on extraordinary exigencies. The sovereign feels\nthat he must provide for such exigencies by saving, because he foresees\nthe absolute impossibility of borrowing. This foresight increases still\nfurther his natural disposition to save.\nThe progress of the enormous debts which at present oppress, and will in\nthe long-run probably ruin, all the great nations of Europe, has been\npretty uniform. Nations, like private men, have generally begun to borrow\nupon what may be called personal credit, without assigning or mortgaging\nany particular fund for the payment of the debt; and when this resource\nhas failed them, they have gone on to borrow upon assignments or mortgages\nof particular funds.\nWhat is called the unfunded debt of Great Britain, is contracted in the\nformer of those two ways. It consists partly in a debt which bears, or is\nsupposed to bear, no interest, and which resembles the debts that a\nprivate man contracts upon account; and partly in a debt which bears\ninterest, and which resembles what a private man contracts upon his bill\nor promissory-note. The debts which are due, either for extraordinary\nservices, or for services either not provided for, or not paid at the time\nwhen they are performed; part of the extraordinaries of the army, navy,\nand ordnance, the arrears of subsidies to foreign princes, those of\nseamen\u2019s wages, etc. usually constitute a debt of the first kind. Navy and\nexchequer bills, which are issued sometimes in payment of a part of such\ndebts, and sometimes for other purposes, constitute a debt of the second\nkind; exchequer bills bearing interest from the day on which they are\nissued, and navy bills six months after they are issued. The bank of\nEngland, either by voluntarily discounting those bills at their current\nvalue, or by agreeing with government for certain considerations to\ncirculate exchequer bills, that is, to receive them at par, paying the\ninterest which happens to be due upon them, keeps up their value, and\nfacilitates their circulation, and thereby frequently enables government\nto contract a very large debt of this kind. In France, where there is no\nbank, the state bills (billets d\u2019etat {See Examen des Reflections\nPolitiques sur les Finances.}) have sometimes sold at sixty and seventy\nper cent. discount. During the great recoinage in king William\u2019s time,\nwhen the bank of England thought proper to put a stop to its usual\ntransactions, exchequer bills and tallies are said to have sold from\ntwenty-five to sixty per cent. discount; owing partly, no doubt, to the\nsupposed instability of the new government established by the Revolution,\nbut partly, too, to the want of the support of the bank of England.\nWhen this resource is exhausted, and it becomes necessary, in order to\nraise money, to assign or mortgage some particular branch of the public\nrevenue for the payment of the debt, government has, upon different\noccasions, done this in two different ways. Sometimes it has made this\nassignment or mortgage for a short period of time only, a year, or a few\nyears, for example; and sometimes for perpetuity. In the one case, the\nfund was supposed sufficient to pay, within the limited time, both\nprincipal and interest of the money borrowed. In the other, it was\nsupposed sufficient to pay the interest only, or a perpetual annuity\nequivalent to the interest, government being at liberty to redeem, at any\ntime, this annuity, upon paying back the principal sum borrowed. When\nmoney was raised in the one way, it was said to be raised by anticipation;\nwhen in the other, by perpetual funding, or, more shortly, by funding.\nIn Great Britain, the annual land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated\nevery year, by virtue of a borrowing clause constantly inserted into the\nacts which impose them. The bank of England generally advances at an\ninterest, which, since the Revolution, has varied from eight to three per\ncent., the sums of which those taxes are granted, and receives payment as\ntheir produce gradually comes in. If there is a deficiency, which there\nalways is, it is provided for in the supplies of the ensuing year. The\nonly considerable branch of the public revenue which yet remains\nunmortgaged, is thus regularly spent before it comes in. Like an\nimprovident spendthrift, whose pressing occasions will not allow him to\nwait for the regular payment of his revenue, the state is in the constant\npractice of borrowing of its own factors and agents, and of paying\ninterest for the use of its own money.\nIn the reign of king William, and during a great part of that of queen\nAnne, before we had become so familiar as we are now with the practice of\nperpetual funding, the greater part of the new taxes were imposed but for\na short period of time (for four, five, six, or seven years only), and a\ngreat part of the grants of every year consisted in loans upon\nanticipations of the produce of those taxes. The produce being frequently\ninsufficient for paying, within the limited term, the principal and\ninterest of the money borrowed, deficiencies arose; to make good which, it\nbecame necessary to prolong the term.\nIn 1697, by the 8th of William III., c. 20, the deficiencies of several\ntaxes were charged upon what was then called the first general mortgage or\nfund, consisting of a prolongation to the first of August 1706, of several\ndifferent taxes, which would have expired within a shorter term, and of\nwhich the produce was accumulated into one general fund. The deficiencies\ncharged upon this prolonged term amounted to \u00a35,160,459: 14: 9\u00bd.\nIn 1701, those duties, with some others, were still further prolonged, for\nthe like purposes, till the first of August 1710, and were called the\nsecond general mortgage or fund. The deficiencies charged upon it amounted\nto \u00a32,055,999: 7: 11\u00bd.\nIn 1707, those duties were still further prolonged, as a fund for new\nloans, to the first of August 1712, and were called the third general\nmortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was \u00a3983,254:11:9\u00bc.\nIn 1708, those duties were all (except the old subsidy of tonnage and\npoundage, of which one moiety only was made a part of this fund, and a\nduty upon the importation of Scotch linen, which had been taken off by the\narticles of union) still further continued, as a fund for new loans, to\nthe first of August 1714, and were called the fourth general mortgage or\nfund. The sum borrowed upon it was \u00a3925,176:9:2\u00bc.\nIn 1709, those duties were all (except the old subsidy of tonnage and\npoundage, which was now left out of this fund altogether) still further\ncontinued, for the same purpose, to the first of August 1716, and were\ncalled the fifth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was\n\u00a3922,029:6s.\nIn 1710, those duties were again prolonged to the first of August 1720,\nand were called the sixth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon\nit was \u00a31,296,552:9:11\u00be.\nIn 1711, the same duties (which at this time were thus subject to four\ndifferent anticipations), together with several others, were continued for\never, and made a fund for paying the interest of the capital of the\nSouth-sea company, which had that year advanced to government, for paying\ndebts, and making good deficiencies, the sum of \u00a39,177,967:15:4d, the\ngreatest loan which at that time had ever been made.\nBefore this period, the principal, so far as I have been able to observe,\nthe only taxes, which, in order to pay the interest of a debt, had been\nimposed for perpetuity, were those for paying the interest of the money\nwhich had been advanced to government by the bank and East-India company,\nand of what it was expected would be advanced, but which was never\nadvanced, by a projected land bank. The bank fund at this time amounted to\n\u00a33,375,027:17:10\u00bd, for which was paid an annuity or interest of\n\u00a3206,501:15:5d. The East-India fund amounted to \u00a33,200,000, for which was\npaid an annuity or interest of \u00a3160,000; the bank fund being at six per\ncent., the East-India fund at five per cent. interest.\nIn 1715, by the first of George I., c. 12, the different taxes which had\nbeen mortgaged for paying the bank annuity, together with several others,\nwhich, by this act, were likewise rendered perpetual, were accumulated\ninto one common fund, called the aggregate fund, which was charged not\nonly with the payment of the bank annuity, but with several other\nannuities and burdens of different kinds. This fund was afterwards\naugmented by the third of George I., c.8., and by the fifth of George I.,\nc. 3, and the different duties which were then added to it were likewise\nrendered perpetual.\nIn 1717, by the third of George I., c. 7, several other taxes were\nrendered perpetual, and accumulated into another common fund, called the\ngeneral fund, for the payment of certain annuities, amounting in the whole\nto \u00a3724,849:6:10\u00bd.\nIn consequence of those different acts, the greater part of the taxes,\nwhich before had been anticipated only for a short term of years were\nrendered perpetual, as a fund for paying, not the capital, but the\ninterest only, of the money which had been borrowed upon them by different\nsuccessive anticipations.\nHad money never been raised but by anticipation, the course of a few years\nwould have liberated the public revenue, without any other attention of\ngovernment besides that of not overloading the fund, by charging it with\nmore debt than it could pay within the limited term, and not of\nanticipating a second time before the expiration of the first\nanticipation. But the greater part of European governments have been\nincapable of those attentions. They have frequently overloaded the fund,\neven upon the first anticipation; and when this happened not to be the\ncase, they have generally taken care to overload it, by anticipating a\nsecond and a third time, before the expiration of the first anticipation.\nThe fund becoming in this manner altogether insufficient for paying both\nprincipal and interest of the money borrowed upon it, it became necessary\nto charge it with the interest only, or a perpetual annuity equal to the\ninterest; and such improvident anticipations necessarily gave birth to the\nmore ruinous practice of perpetual funding. But though this practice\nnecessarily puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed\nperiod, to one so indefinite that it is not very likely ever to arrive;\nyet, as a greater sum can, in all cases, be raised by this new practice\nthan by the old one of anticipation, the former, when men have once become\nfamiliar with it, has, in the great exigencies of the state, been\nuniversally preferred to the latter. To relieve the present exigency, is\nalways the object which principally interests those immediately concerned\nin the administration of public affairs. The future liberation of the\npublic revenue they leave to the care of posterity.\nDuring the reign of queen Anne, the market rate of interest had fallen\nfrom six to five per cent.; and, in the twelfth year of her reign, five\nper cent. was declared to be the highest rate which could lawfully be\ntaken for money borrowed upon private security. Soon after the greater\npart of the temporary taxes of Great Britain had been rendered perpetual,\nand distributed into the aggregate, South-sea, and general funds, the\ncreditors of the public, like those of private persons, were induced to\naccept of five per cent. for the interest of their money, which occasioned\na saving of one per cent. upon the capital of the greater part or the\ndebts which had been thus funded for perpetuity, or of one-sixth of the\ngreater part of the annuities which were paid out of the three great funds\nabove mentioned. This saving left a considerable surplus in the produce of\nthe different taxes which had been accumulated into those funds, over and\nabove what was necessary for paying the annuities which were now charged\nupon them, and laid the foundation of what has since been called the\nsinking fund. In 1717, it amounted to \u00a3523,454:7:7\u00bd. In 1727, the interest\nof the greater part of the public debts was still further reduced to four\nper cent.; and, in 1753 and 1757, to three and a-half, and three per\ncent., which reductions still further augmented the sinking fund.\nA sinking fund, though instituted for the payment of old, facilitates very\nmuch the contracting of new debts. It is a subsidiary fund, always at\nhand, to be mortgaged in aid of any other doubtful fund, upon which money\nis proposed to be raised in any exigency of the state. Whether the sinking\nfund of Great Britain has been more frequently applied to the one or to the\nother of those two purposes, will sufficiently appear by and by.\nBesides those two methods of borrowing, by anticipations and by a\nperpetual funding, there are two other methods, which hold a sort of\nmiddle place between them; these are, that of borrowing upon annuities for\nterms of years, and that of borrowing upon annuities for lives.\nDuring the reigns of king William and queen Anne, large sums were\nfrequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which were\nsometimes longer and sometimes shorter. In 1695, an act was passed for\nborrowing one million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent., or \u00a3140,000\na-year, for sixteen years. In 1691, an act was passed for borrowing a\nmillion upon annuities for lives, upon terms which, in the present times,\nwould appear very advantageous; but the subscription was not filled up. In\nthe following year, the deficiency was made good, by borrowing upon\nannuities for lives, at fourteen per cent. or a little more than seven\nyears purchase. In 1695, the persons who had purchased those annuities\nwere allowed to exchange them for others of ninety-six years, upon paying\ninto the exchequer sixty-three pounds in the hundred; that is, the\ndifference between fourteen per cent. for life, and fourteen per cent. for\nninety-six years, was sold for sixty-three pounds, or for four and a-half\nyears purchase. Such was the supposed instability of government, that even\nthese terms procured few purchasers. In the reign of queen Anne, money\nwas, upon different occasions, borrowed both upon annuities for lives, and\nupon annuities for terms of thirty-two, of eighty-nine, of ninety-eight,\nand of ninety-nine years. In 1719, the proprietors of the annuities for\nthirty-two years were induced to accept, in lieu of them, South-sea stock\nto the amount of eleven and a-half years purchase of the annuities,\ntogether with an additional quantity of stock, equal to the arrears which\nhappened then to be due upon them. In 1720, the greater part of the other\nannuities for terms of years, both long and short, were subscribed into\nthe same fund. The long annuities, at that time, amounted to \u00a3666,821:\n8:3\u00bd a-year. On the 5th of January 1775, the remainder of them, or what\nwas not subscribed at that time, amounted only to \u00a3136,453:12:8d.\nDuring the two wars which began in 1739 and in 1755, little money was\nborrowed, either upon annuities for terms of years, or upon those for\nlives. An annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years, however, is worth\nnearly as much as a perpetuity, and should therefore, one might think, be\na fund for borrowing nearly as much. But those who, in order to make\nfamily settlements, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into the\npublic stocks, would not care to purchase into one of which the value was\ncontinually diminishing; and such people make a very considerable\nproportion, both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock. An annuity\nfor a long term of years, therefore, though its intrinsic value may be\nvery nearly the same with that of a perpetual annuity, will not find\nnearly the same number of purchasers. The subscribers to a new loan, who\nmean generally to sell their subscription as soon as possible, prefer\ngreatly a perpetual annuity, redeemable by parliament, to an irredeemable\nannuity, for a long term of years, of only equal amount. The value of the\nformer may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same; and it\nmakes, therefore, a more convenient transferable stock than the latter.\nDuring the two last-mentioned wars, annuities, either for terms of years\nor for lives, were seldom granted, but as premiums to the subscribers of a\nnew loan, over and above the redeemable annuity or interest, upon the\ncredit of which the loan was supposed to be made. They were granted, not\nas the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed, but as an additional\nencouragement to the lender.\nAnnuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different ways;\neither upon separate lives, or upon lots of lives, which, in French, are\ncalled tontines, from the name of their inventor. When annuities are\ngranted upon separate lives, the death of every individual annuitant\ndisburdens the public revenue, so far as it was affected by his annuity.\nWhen annuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public\nrevenue does not commence till the death of all the annuitants\ncomprehended in one lot, which may sometimes consist of twenty or thirty\npersons, of whom the survivors succeed to the annuities of all those who\ndie before them; the last survivor succeeding to the annuities of the\nwhole lot. Upon the same revenue, more money can always be raised by\ntontines than by annuities for separate lives. An annuity, with a right of\nsurvivorship, is really worth more than an equal annuity for a separate\nlife; and, from the confidence which every man naturally has in his own\ngood fortune, the principle upon which is founded the success of all\nlotteries, such an annuity generally sells for something more than it is\nworth. In countries where it is usual for government to raise money by\ngranting annuities, tontines are, upon this account, generally preferred\nto annuities for separate lives. The expedient which will raise most\nmoney, is almost always preferred to that which is likely to bring about,\nin the speediest manner, the liberation of the public revenue.\nIn France, a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in\nannuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir presented by\nthe parliament of Bourdeaux to the king, in 1764, the whole public debt of\nFrance is estimated at twenty-four hundred millions of livres; of which\nthe capital, for which annuities for lives had been granted, is supposed\nto amount to three hundred millions, the eighth part of the whole public\ndebt. The annuities themselves are computed to amount to thirty millions\na-year, the fourth part of one hundred and twenty millions, the supposed\ninterest of that whole debt. These estimations, I know very well, are not\nexact; but having been presented by so very respectable a body as\napproximations to the truth, they may, I apprehend, be considered as such.\nIt is not the different degrees of anxiety in the two governments of\nFrance and England for the liberation of the public revenue, which\noccasions this difference in their respective modes of borrowing; it\narises altogether from the different views and interests of the lenders.\nIn England, the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile city\nin the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance money to\ngovernment. By advancing it, they do not mean to diminish, but, on the\ncontrary, to increase their mercantile capitals; and unless they expected\nto sell, with some profit, their share in the subscription for a new loan,\nthey never would subscribe. But if, by advancing their money, they were to\npurchase, instead of perpetual annuities, annuities for lives only,\nwhether their own or those of other people, they would not always be so\nlikely to sell them with a profit. Annuities upon their own lives they\nwould always sell with loss; because no man will give for an annuity upon\nthe life of another, whose age and state of health are nearly the same\nwith his own, the same price which he would give for one upon his own. An\nannuity upon the life of a third person, indeed, is, no doubt, of equal\nvalue to the buyer and the seller; but its real value begins to diminish\nfrom the moment it is granted, and continues to do so, more and more, as\nlong as it subsists. It can never, therefore, make so convenient a\ntransferable stock as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be\nsupposed always the same, or very nearly the same.\nIn France, the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city,\nmerchants do not make so great a proportion of the people who advance\nmoney to government. The people concerned in the finances, the\nfarmers-general, the receivers of the taxes which are not in farm, the\ncourt-bankers, etc. make the greater part of those who advance their money\nin all public exigencies. Such people are commonly men of mean birth, but\nof great wealth, and frequently of great pride. They are too proud to\nmarry their equals, and women of quality disdain to marry them. They\nfrequently resolve, therefore, to live bachelors; and having neither any\nfamilies of their own, nor much regard for those of their relations, whom\nthey are not always very fond of acknowledging, they desire only to live\nin splendour during their own time, and are not unwilling that their\nfortune should end with themselves. The number of rich people, besides,\nwho are either averse to marry, or whose condition of life renders it\neither improper or inconvenient for them to do so, is much greater in\nFrance than in England. To such people, who have little or no care for\nposterity, nothing can be more convenient than to exchange their capital\nfor a revenue, which is to last just as long, and no longer, than they\nwish it to do.\nThe ordinary expense of the greater part of modern governments, in time of\npeace, being equal, or nearly equal, to their ordinary revenue, when war\ncomes, they are both unwilling and unable to increase their revenue in\nproportion to the increase of their expense. They are unwilling, for fear\nof offending the people, who, by so great and so sudden an increase of\ntaxes, would soon be disgusted with the war; and they are unable, from not\nwell knowing what taxes would be sufficient to produce the revenue wanted.\nThe facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment which this\nfear and inability would otherwise occasion. By means of borrowing, they\nare enabled, with a very moderate increase of taxes, to raise, from year\nto year, money sufficient for carrying on the war; and by the practice of\nperpetual funding, they are enabled, with the smallest possible increase\nof taxes, to raise annually the largest possible sum of money. In great\nempires, the people who live in the capital, and in the provinces remote\nfrom the scene of action, feel, many of them, scarce any inconveniency\nfrom the war, but enjoy, at their ease, the amusement of reading in the\nnewspapers the exploits of their own fleets and armies. To them this\namusement compensates the small difference between the taxes which they\npay on account of the war, and those which they had been accustomed to pay\nin time of peace. They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace,\nwhich puts an end to their amusement, and to a thousand visionary hopes of\nconquest and national glory, from a longer continuance of the war.\nThe return of peace, indeed, seldom relieves them from the greater part of\nthe taxes imposed during the war. These are mortgaged for the interest of\nthe debt contracted, in order to carry it on. If, over and above paying\nthe interest of this debt, and defraying the ordinary expense of\ngovernment, the old revenue, together with the new taxes, produce some\nsurplus revenue, it may, perhaps, be converted into a sinking fund for\npaying off the debt. But, in the first place, this sinking fund, even\nsupposing it should be applied to no other purpose, is generally\naltogether inadequate for paying, in the course of any period during which\nit can reasonably be expected that peace should continue, the whole debt\ncontracted during the war; and, in the second place, this fund is almost\nalways applied to other purposes.\nThe new taxes were imposed for the sole purpose of paying the interest of\nthe money borrowed upon them. If they produce more, it is generally\nsomething which was neither intended nor expected, and is, therefore,\nseldom very considerable. Sinking funds have generally arisen, not so much\nfrom any surplus of the taxes which was over and above what was necessary\nfor paying the interest or annuity originally charged upon them, as from a\nsubsequent reduction of that interest; that of Holland in 1655, and that\nof the ecclesiastical state in 1685, were both formed in this manner.\nHence the usual insufficiency of such funds.\nDuring the most profound peace, various events occur, which require an\nextraordinary expense; and government finds it always more convenient to\ndefray this expense by misapplying the sinking fund, than by imposing a\nnew tax. Every new tax is immediately felt more or less by the people. It\noccasions always some murmur, and meets with some opposition. The more\ntaxes may have been multiplied, the higher they may have been raised upon\nevery different subject of taxation; the more loudly the people complain\nof every new tax, the more difficult it becomes, too, either to find out\nnew subjects of taxation, or to raise much higher the taxes already\nimposed upon the old. A momentary suspension of the payment of debt is not\nimmediately felt by the people, and occasions neither murmur nor\ncomplaint. To borrow of the sinking fund is always an obvious and easy\nexpedient for getting out of the present difficulty. The more the public\ndebts may have been accumulated, the more necessary it may have become to\nstudy to reduce them; the more dangerous, the more ruinous it may be to\nmisapply any part of the sinking fund; the less likely is the public debt\nto be reduced to any considerable degree, the more likely, the more\ncertainly, is the sinking fund to be misapplied towards defraying all the\nextraordinary expenses which occur in time of peace. When a nation is\nalready overburdened with taxes, nothing but the necessities of a new war,\nnothing but either the animosity of national vengeance, or the anxiety for\nnational security, can induce the people to submit, with tolerable\npatience, to a new tax. Hence the usual misapplication of the sinking\nfund.\nIn Great Britain, from the time that we had first recourse to the ruinous\nexpedient of perpetual funding, the reduction of the public debt, in time\nof peace, has never borne any proportion to its accumulation in time of\nwar. It was in the war which began in 1668, and was concluded by the\ntreaty of Ryswick, in 1697, that the foundation of the present enormous\ndebt of Great Britain was first laid.\nOn the 31st of December 1697, the public debts of Great Britain, funded\nand unfunded, amounted to \u00a321,515,742:13:8\u00bd. A great part of those debts\nhad been contracted upon short anticipations, and some part upon annuities\nfor lives; so that, before the 31st of December 1701, in less than four\nyears, there had partly been paid off; and partly reverted to the public,\nthe sum of \u00a35,121,041:12:0\u00bed; a greater reduction of the public debt than\nhas ever since been brought about in so short a period of time. The\nremaining debt, therefore, amounted only to \u00a316,394,701:1:7\u00bcd.\nIn the war which began in 1702, and which was concluded by the treaty of\nUtrecht, the public debts were still more accumulated. On the 31st of\nDecember 1714, they amounted to \u00a353,681,076:5:6\u00bd. The subscription into\nthe South-sea fund, of the short and long annuities, increased the capital\nof the public debt; so that, on the 31st of December 1722, it amounted to\n\u00a355,282,978:1:3 \u215a. The reduction of the debt began in 1723, and went on\nso slowly, that, on the 31st of December 1739, during seventeen years-of\nprofound peace, the whole sum paid off was no more than \u00a38,328,554:17:11\n\u00b3\u2044\u2081\u2082, the capital of the public debt, at that time, amounting to\n\u00a346,954,623:3:4 \u2077\u2044\u2081\u2082.\nThe Spanish war, which began in 1739, and the French war which soon\nfollowed it, occasioned a further increase of the debt, which, on the 31st\nof December 1748, after the war had been concluded by the treaty of\nAix-la-Chapelle, amounted to \u00a378,293,313:1:10\u00be. The most profound peace,\nof 17 years continuance, had taken no more than \u00a38,328,354, 17:11\u00bc from\nit. A war, of less than nine years continuance, added \u00a331,338,689:18: 6\n\u2159 to it. {See James Postlethwaite\u2019s History of the Public Revenue.}\nDuring the administration of Mr Pelham, the interest of the public debt\nwas reduced, or at least measures were taken for reducing it, from four to\nthree per cent.; the sinking fund was increased, and some part of the\npublic debt was paid off. In 1755, before the breaking out of the late\nwar, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to \u00a372,289,675. On the 5th\nof January 1763, at the conclusion of the peace, the funded debt amounted\ndebt to \u00a3122,603,336:8:2\u00bc. The unfunded debt has been stated at\n\u00a313,927,589:2:2. But the expense occasioned by the war did not end with\nthe conclusion of the peace; so that, though on the 5th of January 1764,\nthe funded debt was increased (partly by a new loan, and partly by funding\na part of the unfunded debt) to \u00a3129,586,789:10:1\u00be, there still remained\n(according to the very well informed author of Considerations on the Trade\nand Finances of Great Britain) an unfunded debt, which was brought to\naccount in that and the following year, of \u00a39,975,017: 12:2 \u00b9\u2075\u2044\u2084\u2084d. In\n1764, therefore, the public debt of Great Britain, funded and unfunded\ntogether, amounted, according to this author, to \u00a3139,561,807:2:4. The\nannuities for lives, too, which had been granted as premiums to the\nsubscribers to the new loans in 1757, estimated at fourteen years\npurchase, were valued at \u00a3472,500; and the annuities for long terms of\nyears, granted as premiums likewise, in 1761 and 1762, estimated at\ntwenty-seven and a-half years purchase, were valued at \u00a36,826,875. During\na peace of about seven years continuance, the prudent and truly patriotic\nadministration of Mr Pelham was not able to pay off an old debt of six\nmillions. During a war of nearly the same continuance, a new debt of more\nthan seventy-five millions was contracted.\nOn the 5th of January 1775, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to\n\u00a3124,996,086, 1:6\u00bcd. The unfunded, exclusive of a large civil-list debt,\nto \u00a34,150,236:3:11 \u215e. Both together, to \u00a3129,146,322:5:6. According to\nthis account, the whole debt paid off, during eleven years of profound\npeace, amounted only to \u00a310,415,476:16:9 \u215e. Even this small reduction of\ndebt, however, has not been all made from the savings out of the ordinary\nrevenue of the state. Several extraneous sums, altogether independent of\nthat ordinary revenue, have contributed towards it. Amongst these we may\nreckon an additional shilling in the pound land tax, for three years; the\ntwo millions received from the East-India company, as indemnification for\ntheir territorial acquisitions; and the one hundred and ten thousand\npounds received from the bank for the renewal of their charter. To these\nmust be added several other sums, which, as they arose out of the late\nwar, ought perhaps to be considered as deductions from the expenses of it.\nThe principal are,\nThe produce of French prizes..............    \u00a3690,449: 18: 9\nComposition for French prisoners.........      670,000:  0: 0\nWhat has been received from the sale\nof the ceded islands.........................   95,500:  0: 0\nTotal, .....................................\u00a31,455,949: 18: 9\nIf we add to this sum the balance of the earl of Chatham\u2019s and Mr\nCalcraft\u2019s accounts, and other army savings of the same kind, together\nwith what has been received from the bank, the East-India company, and the\nadditional shilling in the pound land tax, the whole must be a good deal\nmore than five millions. The debt, therefore, which, since the peace, has\nbeen paid out of the savings from the ordinary revenue of the state, has\nnot, one year with another, amounted to half a million a-year. The sinking\nfund has, no doubt, been considerably augmented since the peace, by the\ndebt which had been paid off, by the reduction of the redeemable four per\ncents to three per cents, and by the annuities for lives which have fallen\nin; and, if peace were to continue, a million, perhaps, might now be\nannually spared out of it towards the discharge of the debt. Another\nmillion, accordingly, was paid in the course of last year; but at the same\ntime, a large civil-list debt was left unpaid, and we are now involved in\na new war, which, in its progress, may prove as expensive as any of our\nformer wars. {It has proved more expensive than any one of our former\nwars, and has involved us in an additional debt of more than one hundred\nmillions. During a profound peace of eleven years, little more than ten\nmillions of debt was paid; during a war of seven years, more than one\nhundred millions was contracted.} The new debt which will probably be\ncontracted before the end of the next campaign, may, perhaps, be nearly\nequal to all the old debt which has been paid off from the savings out of\nthe ordinary revenue of the state. It would be altogether chimerical,\ntherefore, to expect that the public debt should ever be completely\ndischarged, by any savings which are likely to be made from that ordinary\nrevenue as it stands at present.\nThe public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, particularly\nthose of England, have, by one author, been represented as the\naccumulation of a great capital, superadded to the other capital of the\ncountry, by means of which its trade is extended, its manufactures are\nmultiplied, and its lands cultivated and improved, much beyond what they\ncould have been by means of that other capital only. He does not consider\nthat the capital which the first creditors of the public advanced to\ngovernment, was, from the moment in which he advanced it, a certain\nportion of the annual produce, turned away from serving in the function of\na capital, to serve in that of a revenue; from maintaining productive\nlabourers, to maintain unproductive ones, and to be spent and wasted,\ngenerally in the course of the year, without even the hope of any future\nreproduction. In return for the capital which they advanced, they\nobtained, indeed, an annuity of the public funds, in most cases, of more\nthan equal value. This annuity, no doubt, replaced to them their capital,\nand enabled them to carry on their trade and business to the same, or,\nperhaps, to a greater extent than before; that is, they were enabled,\neither to borrow of other people a new capital, upon the credit of this\nannuity or, by selling it, to get from other people a new capital of their\nown, equal, or superior, to that which they had advanced to government.\nThis new capital, however, which they in this manner either bought or\nborrowed of other people, must have existed in the country before, and\nmust have been employed, as all capitals are, in maintaining productive\nlabour. When it came into the hands of those who had advanced their money\nto government, though it was, in some respects, a new capital to them, it\nwas not so to the country, but was only a capital withdrawn from certain\nemployments, in order to be turned towards others. Though it replaced to\nthem what they had advanced to government, it did not replace it to the\ncountry. Had they not advanced this capital to government, there would\nhave been in the country two capitals, two portions of the annual produce,\ninstead of one, employed in maintaining productive labour.\nWhen, for defraying the expense of government, a revenue is raised within\nthe year, from the produce of free or unmortgaged taxes, a certain portion\nof the revenue of private people is only turned away from maintaining one\nspecies of unproductive labour, towards maintaining another. Some part of\nwhat they pay in those taxes, might, no doubt, have been accumulated into\ncapital, and consequently employed in maintaining productive labour; but\nthe greater part would probably have been spent, and consequently employed\nin maintaining unproductive labour. The public expense, however, when\ndefrayed in this manner, no doubt hinders, more or less, the further\naccumulation of new capital; but it does not necessarily occasion the\ndestruction of any actually-existing capital.\nWhen the public expense is defrayed by funding, it is defrayed by the\nannual destruction of some capital which had before existed in the\ncountry; by the perversion of some portion of the annual produce which had\nbefore been destined for the maintenance of productive labour, towards\nthat of unproductive labour. As in this case, however, the taxes are\nlighter than they would have been, had a revenue sufficient for defraying\nthe same expense been raised within the year; the private revenue of\nindividuals is necessarily less burdened, and consequently their ability\nto save and accumulate some part of that revenue into capital, is a good\ndeal less impaired. If the method of funding destroys more old capital,\nit, at the same time, hinders less the accumulation or acquisition of new\ncapital, than that of defraying the public expense by a revenue raised\nwithin the year. Under the system of funding, the frugality and industry\nof private people can more easily repair the breaches which the waste and\nextravagance of government may occasionally make in the general capital of\nthe society.\nIt is only during the continuance of war, however, that the system of\nfunding has this advantage over the other system. Were the expense of war\nto be defrayed always by a revenue raised within the year, the taxes from\nwhich that extraordinary revenue was drawn would last no longer than the\nwar. The ability of private people to accumulate, though less during the\nwar, would have been greater during the peace, than under the system of\nfunding. War would not necessarily have occasioned the destruction of any\nold capitals, and peace would have occasioned the accumulation of many\nmore new. Wars would, in general, be more speedily concluded, and less\nwantonly undertaken. The people feeling, during continuance of war, the\ncomplete burden of it, would soon grow weary of it; and government, in\norder to humour them, would not be under the necessity of carrying it on\nlonger than it was necessary to do so. The foresight of the heavy and\nunavoidable burdens of war would hinder the people from wantonly calling\nfor it when there was no real or solid interest to fight for. The seasons\nduring which the ability of private people to accumulate was somewhat\nimpaired, would occur more rarely, and be of shorter continuance. Those,\non the contrary, during which that ability was in the highest vigour would\nbe of much longer duration than they can well be under the system of\nfunding.\nWhen funding, besides, has made a certain progress, the multiplication of\ntaxes which it brings along with it, sometimes impairs as much the ability\nof private people to accumulate, even in time of peace, as the other\nsystem would in time of war. The peace revenue of Great Britain amounts at\npresent to more than ten millions a-year. If free and unmortgaged, it\nmight be sufficient, with proper management, and without contracting a\nshilling of new debt, to carry on the most vigorous war. The private\nrevenue of the inhabitants of Great Britain is at present as much\nincumbered in time of peace, their ability to accumulate is as much\nimpaired, as it would have been in the time of the most expensive war, had\nthe pernicious system of funding never been adopted.\nIn the payment of the interest of the public debt, it has been said, it is\nthe right hand which pays the left. The money does not go out of the\ncountry. It is only a part of the revenue of one set of the inhabitants\nwhich is transferred to another; and the nation is not a farthing the\npoorer. This apology is founded altogether in the sophistry of the\nmercantile system; and, after the long examination which I have already\nbestowed upon that system, it may, perhaps, be unnecessary to say anything\nfurther about it. It supposes, besides, that the whole public debt is\nowing to the inhabitants of the country, which happens not to be true; the\nDutch, as well as several other foreign nations, having a very\nconsiderable share in our public funds. But though the whole debt were\nowing to the inhabitants of the country, it would not, upon that account,\nbe less pernicious.\nLand and capital stock are the two original sources of all revenue, both\nprivate and public. Capital stock pays the wages of productive labour,\nwhether employed in agriculture, manufactures, or commerce. The management\nof those two original sources of revenue belongs to two different sets of\npeople; the proprietors of land, and the owners or employers of capital\nstock.\nThe proprietor of land is interested, for the sake of his own revenue, to\nkeep his estate in as good condition as he can, by building and repairing\nhis tenants houses, by making and maintaining the necessary drains and\ninclosures, and all those other expensive improvements which it properly\nbelongs to the landlord to make and maintain. But, by different land\ntaxes, the revenue of the landlord may be so much diminished, and, by\ndifferent duties upon the necessaries and conveniencies of life, that\ndiminished revenue may be rendered of so little real value, that he may\nfind himself altogether unable to make or maintain those expensive\nimprovements. When the landlord, however, ceases to do his part, it is\naltogether impossible that the tenant should continue to do his. As the\ndistress of the landlord increases, the agriculture of the country must\nnecessarily decline.\nWhen, by different taxes upon the necessaries and conveniencies of life,\nthe owners and employers of capital stock find, that whatever revenue they\nderive from it, will not, in a particular country, purchase the same\nquantity of those necessaries and conveniencies which an equal revenue\nwould in almost any other, they will be disposed to remove to some other.\nAnd when, in order to raise those taxes, all or the greater part of\nmerchants and manufacturers, that is, all or the greater part of the\nemployers of great capitals, come to be continually exposed to the\nmortifying and vexatious visits of the tax-gatherers, this disposition to\nremove will soon be changed into an actual removing. The industry of the\ncountry will necessarily fall with the removal of the capital which\nsupported it, and the ruin of trade and manufactures will follow the\ndeclension of agriculture.\nTo transfer from the owners of those two great sources of revenue, land,\nand capital stock, from the persons immediately interested in the good\ncondition of every particular portion of land, and in the good management\nof every particular portion of capital stock, to another set of persons\n(the creditors of the public, who have no such particular interest), the\ngreater part of the revenue arising from either, must, in the long-run,\noccasion both the neglect of land, and the waste or removal of capital\nstock. A creditor of the public has, no doubt, a general interest in the\nprosperity of the agriculture, manufactures, and commerce of the country;\nand consequently in the good condition of its land, and in the good\nmanagement of its capital stock. Should there be any general failure or\ndeclension in any of these things, the produce of the different taxes\nmight no longer be sufficient to pay him the annuity or interest which is\ndue to him. But a creditor of the public, considered merely as such, has\nno interest in the good condition of any particular portion of land, or in\nthe good management of any particular portion of capital stock. As a\ncreditor of the public, he has no knowledge of any such particular\nportion. He has no inspection of it. He can have no care about it. Its\nruin may in some cases be unknown to him, and cannot directly affect him.\nThe practice of funding has gradually enfeebled every state which has\nadopted it. The Italian republics seem to have begun it. Genoa and Venice,\nthe only two remaining which can pretend to an independent existence, have\nboth been enfeebled by it. Spain seems to have learned the practice from\nthe Italian republics, and (its taxes being probably less judicious than\ntheirs) it has, in proportion to its natural strength, been-still more\nenfeebled. The debts of Spain are of very old standing. It was deeply in\ndebt before the end of the sixteenth century, about a hundred years before\nEngland owed a shilling. France, notwithstanding all its natural\nresources, languishes under an oppressive load of the same kind. The\nrepublic of the United Provinces is as much enfeebled by its debts as\neither Genoa or Venice. Is it likely that, in Great Britain alone, a\npractice, which has brought either weakness or dissolution into every\nother country, should prove altogether innocent?\nThe system of taxation established in those different countries, it may be\nsaid, is inferior to that of England. I believe it is so. But it ought to\nbe remembered, that when the wisest government has exhausted all the\nproper subjects of taxation, it must, in cases of urgent necessity, have\nrecourse to improper ones. The wise republic of Holland has, upon some\noccasions, been obliged to have recourse to taxes as inconvenient as the\ngreater part of those of Spain. Another war, begun before any considerable\nliberation of the public revenue had been brought about, and growing in\nits progress as expensive as the last war, may, from irresistible\nnecessity, render the British system of taxation as oppressive as that of\nHolland, or even as that of Spain. To the honour of our present system of\ntaxation, indeed, it has hitherto given so little embarrassment to\nindustry, that, during the course even of the most expensive wars, the\nfrugality and good conduct of individuals seem to have been able, by\nsaving and accumulation, to repair all the breaches which the waste and\nextravagance of government had made in the general capital of the society.\nAt the conclusion of the late war, the most expensive that Great Britain\never waged, her agriculture was as flourishing, her manufacturers as\nnumerous and as fully employed, and her commerce as extensive, as they had\never been before. The capital, therefore, which supported all those\ndifferent branches of industry, must have been equal to what it had ever\nbeen before. Since the peace, agriculture has been still further improved;\nthe rents of houses have risen in every town and village of the country, a\nproof of the increasing wealth and revenue of the people; and the annual\namount of the greater part of the old taxes, of the principal branches of\nthe excise and customs, in particular, has been continually increasing, an\nequally clear proof of an increasing consumption, and consequently of an\nincreasing produce, which could alone support that consumption. Great\nBritain seems to support with ease, a burden which, half a century ago,\nnobody believed her capable of supporting, Let us not, however, upon this\naccount, rashly conclude that she is capable of supporting any burden; nor\neven be too confident that she could support, without great distress, a\nburden a little greater than what has already been laid upon her.\nWhen national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there\nis scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and\ncompletely paid. The liberation of the public revenue, if it has ever been\nbrought about at all, has always been brought about by a bankruptcy;\nsometimes by an avowed one, though frequently by a pretended payment.\nThe raising of the denomination of the coin has been the most usual\nexpedient by which a real public bankruptcy has been disguised under the\nappearance of a pretended payment. If a sixpence, for example, should,\neither by act of parliament or royal proclamation, be raised to the\ndenomination of a shilling, and twenty sixpences to that of a pound\nsterling; the person who, under the old denomination, had borrowed twenty\nshillings, or near four ounces of silver, would, under the new, pay with\ntwenty sixpences, or with something less than two ounces. A national debt\nof about a hundred and twenty-eight millions, near the capital of the\nfunded and unfunded debt of Great Britain, might, in this manner, be paid\nwith about sixty-four millions of our present money. It would, indeed, be\na pretended payment only, and the creditors of the public would really be\ndefrauded of ten shillings in the pound of what was due to them. The\ncalamity, too, would extend much further than to the creditors of the\npublic, and those of every private person would suffer a proportionable\nloss; and this without any advantage, but in most cases with a great\nadditional loss, to the creditors of the public. If the creditors of the\npublic, indeed, were generally much in debt to other people, they might in\nsome measure compensate their loss by paying their creditors in the same\ncoin in which the public had paid them. But in most countries, the\ncreditors of the public are, the greater part of them, wealthy people, who\nstand more in the relation of creditors than in that of debtors, towards\nthe rest of their fellow citizens. A pretended payment of this kind,\ntherefore, instead of alleviating, aggravates, in most cases, the loss of\nthe creditors of the public; and, without any advantage to the public,\nextends the calamity to a great number of other innocent people. It\noccasions a general and most pernicious subversion of the fortunes of\nprivate people; enriching, in most cases, the idle and profuse debtor, at\nthe expense of the industrious and frugal creditor; and transporting a\ngreat part of the national capital from the hands which were likely to\nincrease and improve it, to those who are likely to dissipate and destroy\nit. When it becomes necessary for a state to declare itself bankrupt, in\nthe same manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so, a\nfair, open, and avowed bankruptcy, is always the measure which is both\nleast dishonourable to the debtor, and least hurtful to the creditor. The\nhonour of a state is surely very poorly provided for, when, in order to\ncover the disgrace of a real bankruptcy, it has recourse to a juggling\ntrick of this kind, so easily seen through, and at the same time so\nextremely pernicious.\nAlmost all states, however, ancient as well as modern, when reduced to\nthis necessity, have, upon some occasions, played this very juggling\ntrick. The Romans, at the end of the first Punic war, reduced the As, the\ncoin or denomination by which they computed the value of all their other\ncoins, from containing twelve ounces of copper, to contain only two\nounces; that is, they raised two ounces of copper to a denomination which\nhad always before expressed the value of twelve ounces. The republic was,\nin this manner, enabled to pay the great debts which it had contracted\nwith the sixth part of what it really owed. So sudden and so great a\nbankruptcy, we should in the present times be apt to imagine, must have\noccasioned a very violent popular clamour. It does not appear to have\noccasioned any. The law which enacted it was, like all other laws relating\nto the coin, introduced and carried through the assembly of the people by\na tribune, and was probably a very popular law. In Rome, as in all other\nancient republics, the poor people were constantly in debt to the rich and\nthe great, who, in order to secure their votes at the annual elections,\nused to lend them money at exorbitant interest, which, being never paid,\nsoon accumulated into a sum too great either for the debtor to pay, or for\nany body else to pay for him. The debtor, for fear of a very severe\nexecution, was obliged, without any further gratuity, to vote for the\ncandidate whom the creditor recommended. In spite of all the laws against\nbribery and corruption, the bounty of the candidates, together with the\noccasional distributions of coin which were ordered by the senate, were\nthe principal funds from which, during the latter times of the Roman\nrepublic, the poorer citizens derived their subsistence. To deliver\nthemselves from this subjection to their creditors, the poorer citizens\nwere continually calling out, either for an entire abolition of debts, or\nfor what they called new tables; that is, for a law which should entitle\nthem to a complete acquittance, upon paying only a certain proportion of\ntheir accumulated debts. The law which reduced the coin of all\ndenominations to a sixth part of its former value, as it enabled them to\npay their debts with a sixth part of what they really owed, was equivalent\nto the most advantageous new tables. In order to satisfy the people, the\nrich and the great were, upon several different occasions, obliged to\nconsent to laws, both for abolishing debts, and for introducing new\ntables; and they probably were induced to consent to this law, partly for\nthe same reason, and partly that, by liberating the public revenue, they\nmight restore vigour to that government, of which they themselves had the\nprincipal direction. An operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt\nof \u00a3128,000,000 to \u00a321,333,333:6:8. In the course of the second Punic war,\nthe As was still further reduced, first, from two ounces of copper to one\nounce, and afterwards from one ounce to half an ounce; that is, to the\ntwenty-fourth part of its original value. By combining the three Roman\noperations into one, a debt of a hundred and twenty-eight millions of our\npresent money, might in this manner be reduced all at once to a debt of\n\u00a35,333,333:6:8. Even the enormous debt of Great Britain might in this\nmanner soon be paid.\nBy means of such expedients, the coin of, I believe, all nations, has been\ngradually reduced more and more below its original value, and the same\nnominal sum has been gradually brought to contain a smaller and a smaller\nquantity of silver.\nNations have sometimes, for the same purpose, adulterated the standard of\ntheir coin; that is, have mixed a greater quantity of alloy in it. If in\nthe pound weight of our silver coin, for example, instead of eighteen\npenny-weight, according to the present standard, there were mixed eight\nounces of alloy; a pound sterling, or twenty shillings of such coin, would\nbe worth little more than six shillings and eightpence of our present\nmoney. The quantity of silver contained in six shillings and eightpence of\nour present money, would thus be raised very nearly to the denomination of\na pound sterling. The adulteration of the standard has exactly the same\neffect with what the French call an augmentation, or a direct raising of\nthe denomination of the coin.\nAn augmentation, or a direct raising of the denomination of the coin,\nalways is, and from its nature must be, an open and avowed operation. By\nmeans of it, pieces of a smaller weight and bulk are called by the same\nname, which had before been given to pieces of a greater weight and bulk.\nThe adulteration of the standard, on the contrary, has generally been a\nconcealed operation. By means of it, pieces are issued from the mint, of\nthe same denomination, and, as nearly as could be contrived, of the same\nweight, bulk, and appearance, with pieces which had been current before of\nmuch greater value. When king John of France, {See Du Cange Glossary, voce\nMoneta; the Benedictine Edition.} in order to pay his debts, adulterated\nhis coin, all the officers of his mint were sworn to secrecy. Both\noperations are unjust. But a simple augmentation is an injustice of open\nviolence; whereas an adulteration is an injustice of treacherous fraud.\nThis latter operation, therefore, as soon as it has been discovered, and\nit could never be concealed very long, has always excited much greater\nindignation than the former. The coin, after any considerable\naugmentation, has very seldom been brought back to its former weight; but\nafter the greatest adulterations, it has almost always been brought back\nto its former fineness. It has scarce ever happened, that the fury and\nindignation of the people could otherwise be appeased.\nIn the end of the reign of Henry VIII., and in the beginning of that of\nEdward VI., the English coin was not only raised in its denomination, but\nadulterated in its standard. The like frauds were practised in Scotland\nduring the minority of James VI. They have occasionally been practised in\nmost other countries.\nThat the public revenue of Great Britain can never be completely\nliberated, or even that any considerable progress can ever be made towards\nthat liberation, while the surplus of that revenue, or what is over and\nabove defraying the annual expense of the peace establishment, is so very\nsmall, it seems altogether in vain to expect. That liberation, it is\nevident, can never be brought about, without either some very considerable\naugmentation of the public revenue, or some equally considerable reduction\nof the public expense.\nA more equal land tax, a more equal tax upon the rent of houses, and such\nalterations in the present system of customs and excise as those which\nhave been mentioned in the foregoing chapter, might, perhaps, without\nincreasing the burden of the greater part of the people, but only\ndistributing the weight of it more equally upon the whole, produce a\nconsiderable augmentation of revenue. The most sanguine projector,\nhowever, could scarce flatter himself, that any augmentation of this kind\nwould be such as could give any reasonable hopes, either of liberating the\npublic revenue altogether, or even of making such progress towards that\nliberation in time of peace, as either to prevent or to compensate the\nfurther accumulation of the public debt in the next war.\nBy extending the British system of taxation to all the different provinces\nof the empire, inhabited by people either of British or European\nextraction, a much greater augmentation of revenue might be expected.\nThis, however, could scarce, perhaps, be done, consistently with the\nprinciples of the British constitution, without admitting into the British\nparliament, or, if you will, into the states-general of the British\nempire, a fair and equal representation of all those different provinces;\nthat of each province bearing the same proportion to the produce of its\ntaxes, as the representation of Great Britain might bear to the produce of\nthe taxes levied upon Great Britain. The private interest of many powerful\nindividuals, the confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people, seem,\nindeed, at present, to oppose to so great a change, such obstacles as it\nmay be very difficult, perhaps altogether impossible, to surmount.\nWithout, however, pretending to determine whether such a union be\npracticable or impracticable, it may not, perhaps, be improper, in a\nspeculative work of this kind, to consider how far the British system of\ntaxation might be applicable to all the different provinces of the empire;\nwhat revenue might be expected from it, if so applied; and in what manner\na general union of this kind might be likely to affect the happiness and\nprosperity of the different provinces comprehended within it. Such a\nspeculation, can, at worst, be regarded but as a new Utopia, less amusing,\ncertainly, but no more useless and chimerical than the old one.\nThe land-tax, the stamp duties, and the different duties of customs and\nexcise, constitute the four principal branches of the British taxes.\nIreland is certainly as able, and our American and West India plantations\nmore able, to pay a land tax, than Great Britain. Where the landlord is\nsubject neither to tythe nor poor\u2019s rate, he must certainly be more able\nto pay such a tax, than where he is subject to both those other burdens.\nThe tythe, where there is no modus, and where it is levied in kind,\ndiminishes more what would otherwise be the rent of the landlord, than a\nland tax which really amounted to five shillings in the pound. Such a\ntythe will be found, in most cases, to amount to more than a fourth part\nof the real rent of the land, or of what remains after replacing\ncompletely the capital of the farmer, together with his reasonable profit.\nIf all moduses and all impropriations were taken away, the complete church\ntythe of Great Britain and Ireland could not well be estimated at less\nthan six or seven millions. If there was no tythe either in Great Britain\nor Ireland, the landlords could afford to pay six or seven millions\nadditional land tax, without being more burdened than a very great part of\nthem are at present. America pays no tythe, and could, therefore, very\nwell afford to pay a land tax. The lands in America and the West Indies,\nindeed, are, in general, not tenanted nor leased out to farmers. They\ncould not, therefore, be assessed according to any rent roll. But neither\nwere the lands of Great Britain, in the 4th of William and Mary, assessed\naccording to any rent roll, but according to a very loose and inaccurate\nestimation. The lands in America might be assessed either in the same\nmanner, or according to an equitable valuation, in consequence of an\naccurate survey, like that which was lately made in the Milanese, and in\nthe dominions of Austria, Prussia, and Sardinia.\nStamp duties, it is evident, might be levied without any variation, in all\ncountries where the forms of law process, and the deeds by which property,\nboth real and personal, is transferred, are the same, or nearly the same.\nThe extension of the custom-house laws of Great Britain to Ireland and the\nplantations, provided it was accompanied, as in justice it ought to be,\nwith an extension of the freedom of trade, would be in the highest degree\nadvantageous to both. All the invidious restraints which at present\noppress the trade of Ireland, the distinction between the enumerated and\nnon-enumerated commodities of America, would be entirely at an end. The\ncountries north of Cape Finisterre would be as open to every part of the\nproduce of America, as those south of that cape are to some parts of that\nproduce at present. The trade between all the different parts of the\nBritish empire would, in consequence of this uniformity in the\ncustom-house laws, be as free as the coasting trade of Great Britain is at\npresent. The British empire would thus afford, within itself, an immense\ninternal market for every part of the produce of all its different\nprovinces. So great an extension of market would soon compensate, both to\nIreland and the plantations, all that they could suffer from the increase\nof the duties of customs.\nThe excise is the only part of the British system of taxation, which would\nrequire to be varied in any respect, according as it was applied to the\ndifferent provinces of the empire. It might be applied to Ireland without\nany variation; the produce and consumption of that kingdom being exactly\nof the same nature with those of Great Britain. In its application to\nAmerica and the West Indies, of which the produce and consumption are so\nvery different from those of Great Britain, some modification might be\nnecessary, in the same manner as in its application to the cyder and beer\ncounties of England.\nA fermented liquor, for example, which is called beer, but which, as it is\nmade of molasses, bears very little resemblance to our beer, makes a\nconsiderable part of the common drink of the people in America. This\nliquor, as it can be kept only for a few days, cannot, like our beer, be\nprepared and stored up for sale in great breweries; but every private\nfamily must brew it for their own use, in the same manner as they cook\ntheir victuals. But to subject every private family to the odious visits\nand examination of the tax-gatherers, in the same manner as we subject the\nkeepers of ale-houses and the brewers for public sale, would be altogether\ninconsistent with liberty. If, for the sake of equality, it was thought\nnecessary to lay a tax upon this liquor, it might be taxed by taxing the\nmaterial of which it is made, either at the place of manufacture, or, if\nthe circumstances of the trade rendered such an excise improper, by laying\na duty upon its importation into the colony in which it was to be\nconsumed. Besides the duty of one penny a-gallon imposed by the British\nparliament upon the importation of molasses into America, there is a\nprovincial tax of this kind upon their importation into Massachusetts Bay,\nin ships belonging to any other colony, of eight-pence the hogshead; and\nanother upon their importation from the northern colonies into South\nCarolina, of five-pence the gallon. Or, if neither of these methods was\nfound convenient, each family might compound for its consumption of this\nliquor, either according to the number of persons of which it consisted,\nin the same manner as private families compound for the malt tax in\nEngland; or according to the different ages and sexes of those persons, in\nthe same manner as several different taxes are levied in Holland; or,\nnearly as Sir Matthew Decker proposes, that all taxes upon consumable\ncommodities should be levied in England. This mode of taxation, it has\nalready been observed, when applied to objects of a speedy consumption, is\nnot a very convenient one. It might be adopted, however, in cases where no\nbetter could be done.\nSugar, rum, and tobacco, are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of\nlife, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which\nare, therefore, extremely proper subjects of taxation. If a union with the\ncolonies were to take place, those commodities might be taxed, either\nbefore they go out of the hands of the manufacturer or grower; or, if this\nmode of taxation did not suit the circumstances of those persons, they\nmight be deposited in public warehouses, both at the place of manufacture,\nand at all the different ports of the empire, to which they might\nafterwards be transported, to remain there, under the joint custody of the\nowner and the revenue officer, till such time as they should be delivered\nout, either to the consumer, to the merchant-retailer for home\nconsumption, or to the merchant-exporter; the tax not to be advanced till\nsuch delivery. When delivered out for exportation, to go duty-free, upon\nproper security being given, that they should really be exported out of\nthe empire. These are, perhaps, the principal commodities, with regard to\nwhich the union with the colonies might require some considerable change\nin the present system of British taxation.\nWhat might be the amount of the revenue which this system of taxation,\nextended to all the different provinces of the empire, might produce, it\nmust, no doubt, be altogether impossible to ascertain with tolerable\nexactness. By means of this system, there is annually levied in Great\nBritain, upon less than eight millions of people, more than ten millions\nof revenue. Ireland contains more than two millions of people, and,\naccording to the accounts laid before the congress, the twelve associated\nprovinces of America contain more than three. Those accounts, however, may\nhave been exaggerated, in order, perhaps, either to encourage their own\npeople, or to intimidate those of this country; and we shall suppose,\ntherefore, that our North American and West Indian colonies, taken\ntogether, contain no more than three millions; or that the whole British\nempire, in Europe and America, contains no more than thirteen millions of\ninhabitants. If, upon less than eight millions of inhabitants, this system\nof taxation raises a revenue of more than ten millions sterling; it ought,\nupon thirteen millions of inhabitants, to raise a revenue of more than\nsixteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. From this\nrevenue, supposing that this system could produce it, must be deducted the\nrevenue usually raised in Ireland and the plantations, for defraying the\nexpense of the respective civil governments. The expense of the civil and\nmilitary establishment of Ireland, together with the interest of the\npublic debt, amounts, at a medium of the two years which ended March 1775,\nto something less than seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year. By\na very exact account of the revenue of the principal colonies of America\nand the West Indies, it amounted, before the commencement of the present\ndisturbances, to a hundred and forty-one thousand eight hundred pounds. In\nthis account, however, the revenue of Maryland, of North Carolina, and of\nall our late acquisitions, both upon the continent, and in the islands, is\nomitted; which may, perhaps, make a difference of thirty or forty thousand\npounds. For the sake of even numbers, therefore, let us suppose that the\nrevenue necessary for supporting the civil government of Ireland and the\nplantations may amount to a million. There would remain, consequently, a\nrevenue of fifteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, to be\napplied towards defraying the general expense of the empire, and towards\npaying the public debt. But if, from the present revenue of Great Britain,\na million could, in peaceable times, be spared towards the payment of that\ndebt, six millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds could very well\nbe spared from this improved revenue. This great sinking fund, too, might\nbe augmented every year by the interest of the debt which had been\ndischarged the year before; and might, in this manner, increase so very\nrapidly, as to be sufficient in a few years to discharge the whole debt,\nand thus to restore completely the at-present debilitated and languishing\nvigour of the empire. In the meantime, the people might be relieved from\nsome of the most burdensome taxes; from those which are imposed either\nupon the necessaries of life, or upon the materials of manufacture. The\nlabouring poor would thus be enabled to live better, to work cheaper, and\nto send their goods cheaper to market. The cheapness of their goods would\nincrease the demand for them, and consequently for the labour of those who\nproduced them. This increase in the demand for labour would both increase\nthe numbers, and improve the circumstances of the labouring poor. Their\nconsumption would increase, and, together with it, the revenue arising\nfrom all those articles of their consumption upon which the taxes might be\nallowed to remain.\nThe revenue arising from this system of taxation, however, might not\nimmediately increase in proportion to the number of people who were\nsubjected to it. Great indulgence would for some time be due to those\nprovinces of the empire which were thus subjected to burdens to which they\nhad not before been accustomed; and even when the same taxes came to be\nlevied everywhere as exactly as possible, they would not everywhere\nproduce a revenue proportioned to the numbers of the people. In a poor\ncountry, the consumption of the principal commodities subject to the\nduties of customs and excise, is very small; and in a thinly inhabited\ncountry, the opportunities of smuggling are very great. The consumption of\nmalt liquors among the inferior ranks of people in Scotland is very small;\nand the excise upon malt, beer, and ale, produces less there than in\nEngland, in proportion to the numbers of the people and the rate of the\nduties, which upon malt is different, on account of a supposed difference\nof quality. In these particular branches of the excise, there is not, I\napprehend, much more smuggling in the one country than in the other. The\nduties upon the distillery, and the greater part of the duties of customs,\nin proportion to the numbers of people in the respective countries,\nproduce less in Scotland than in England, not only on account of the\nsmaller consumption of the taxed commodities, but of the much greater\nfacility of smuggling. In Ireland, the inferior ranks of people are still\npoorer than in Scotland, and many parts of the country are almost as\nthinly inhabited. In Ireland, therefore, the consumption of the taxed\ncommodities might, in proportion to the number of the people, be still\nless than in Scotland, and the facility of smuggling nearly the same. In\nAmerica and the West Indies, the white people, even of the lowest rank,\nare in much better circumstances than those of the same rank in England;\nand their consumption of all the luxuries in which they usually indulge\nthemselves, is probably much greater. The blacks, indeed, who make the\ngreater part of the inhabitants, both of the southern colonies upon the\ncontinent and of the West India islands, as they are in a state of\nslavery, are, no doubt, in a worse condition than the poorest people\neither in Scotland or Ireland. We must not, however, upon that account,\nimagine that they are worse fed, or that their consumption of articles\nwhich might be subjected to moderate duties, is less than that even of the\nlower ranks of people in England. In order that they may work well, it is\nthe interest of their master that they should be fed well, and kept in\ngood heart, in the same manner as it is his interest that his working\ncattle should be so. The blacks, accordingly, have almost everywhere their\nallowance of rum, and of molasses or spruce-beer, in the same manner as\nthe white servants; and this allowance would not probably be withdrawn,\nthough those articles should be subjected to moderate duties. The\nconsumption of the taxed commodities, therefore, in proportion to the\nnumber of inhabitants, would probably be as great in America and the West\nIndies as in any part of the British empire. The opportunities of\nsmuggling, indeed, would be much greater; America, in proportion to the\nextent of the country, being much more thinly inhabited than either\nScotland or Ireland. If the revenue, however, which is at present raised\nby the different duties upon malt and malt liquors, were to be levied by a\nsingle duty upon malt, the opportunity of smuggling in the most important\nbranch of the excise would be almost entirely taken away; and if the\nduties of customs, instead of being imposed upon almost all the different\narticles of importation, were confined to a few of the most general use\nand consumption, and if the levying of those duties were subjected to the\nexcise laws, the opportunity of smuggling, though not so entirely taken\naway, would be very much diminished. In consequence of those two\napparently very simple and easy alterations, the duties of customs and\nexcise might probably produce a revenue as great, in proportion to the\nconsumption of the most thinly inhabited province, as they do at present,\nin proportion to that of the most populous.\nThe Americans, it has been said, indeed, have no gold or silver money, the\ninterior commerce of the country being carried on by a paper currency; and\nthe gold and silver, which occasionally come among them, being all sent to\nGreat Britain, in return for the commodities which they receive from us.\nBut without gold and silver, it is added, there is no possibility of\npaying taxes. We already get all the gold and silver which they have. How\nis it possible to draw from them what they have not?\nThe present scarcity of gold and silver money in America, is not the\neffect of the poverty of that country, or of the inability of the people\nthere to purchase those metals. In a country where the wages of labour are\nso much higher, and the price of provisions so much lower than in England,\nthe greater part of the people must surely have wherewithal to purchase a\ngreater quantity, if it were either necessary or convenient for them to do\nso. The scarcity of those metals, therefore, must be the effect of choice,\nand not of necessity.\nIt is for transacting either domestic or foreign business, that gold or\nsilver money is either necessary or convenient.\nThe domestic business of every country, it has been shewn in the second\nbook of this Inquiry, may, at least in peaceable times, be transacted by\nmeans of a paper currency, with nearly the same degree of conveniency as\nby gold and silver money. It is convenient for the Americans, who could\nalways employ with profit, in the improvement of their lands, a greater\nstock than they can easily get, to save as much as possible the expense of\nso costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver; and rather to\nemploy that part of their surplus produce which would be necessary for\npurchasing those metals, in purchasing the instruments of trade, the\nmaterials of clothing, several parts of household furniture, and the iron\nwork necessary for building and extending their settlements and\nplantations; in purchasing not dead stock, but active and productive\nstock. The colony governments find it for their interest to supply the\npeople with such a quantity of paper money as is fully sufficient, and\ngenerally more than sufficient, for transacting their domestic business.\nSome of those governments, that of Pennsylvania, particularly, derive a\nrevenue from lending this paper money to their subjects, at an interest of\nso much per cent. Others, like that of Massachusetts Bay, advance, upon\nextraordinary emergencies, a paper money of this kind for defraying the\npublic expense; and afterwards, when it suits the conveniency of the\ncolony, redeem it at the depreciated value to which it gradually falls. In\n1747, {See Hutchinson\u2019s History of Massachusetts Bay vol. ii. page 436 et\nseq.} that colony paid in this manner the greater part of its public\ndebts, with the tenth part of the money for which its bills had been\ngranted. It suits the conveniency of the planters, to save the expense of\nemploying gold and silver money in their domestic transactions; and it\nsuits the conveniency of the colony governments, to supply them with a\nmedium, which, though attended with some very considerable disadvantages,\nenables them to save that expense. The redundancy of paper money\nnecessarily banishes gold and silver from the domestic transactions of the\ncolonies, for the same reason that it has banished those metals from the\ngreater part of the domestic transactions in Scotland; and in both\ncountries, it is not the poverty, but the enterprizing and projecting\nspirit of the people, their desire of employing all the stock which they\ncan get, as active and productive stock, which has occasioned this\nredundancy of paper money.\nIn the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with Great\nBritain, gold and silver are more or less employed, exactly in proportion\nas they are more or less necessary. Where those metals are not necessary,\nthey seldom appear. Where they are necessary, they are generally found.\nIn the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies, the\nBritish goods are generally advanced to the colonists at a pretty long\ncredit, and are afterwards paid for in tobacco, rated at a certain price.\nIt is more convenient for the colonists to pay in tobacco than in gold and\nsilver. It would be more convenient for any merchant to pay for the goods\nwhich his correspondents had sold to him, in some other sort of goods\nwhich he might happen to deal in, than in money. Such a merchant would\nhave no occasion to keep any part of his stock by him unemployed, and in\nready money, for answering occasional demands. He could have, at all\ntimes, a larger quantity of goods in his shop or warehouse, and he could\ndeal to a greater extent. But it seldom happens to be convenient for all\nthe correspondents of a merchant to receive payment for the goods which\nthey sell to him, in goods of some other kind which he happens to deal in.\nThe British merchants who trade to Virginia and Maryland, happen to be a\nparticular set of correspondents, to whom it is more convenient to receive\npayment for the goods which they sell to those colonies in tobacco, than\nin gold and silver. They expect to make a profit by the sale of the\ntobacco; they could make none by that of the gold and silver. Gold and\nsilver, therefore, very seldom appear in the commerce between Great\nBritain and the tobacco colonies. Maryland and Virginia have as little\noccasion for those metals in their foreign, as in their domestic commerce.\nThey are said, accordingly, to have less gold and silver money than any\nother colonies in America. They are reckoned, however, as thriving, and\nconsequently as rich, as any of their neighbours.\nIn the northern colonies, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, the four\ngovernments of New England, etc. the value of their own produce which they\nexport to Great Britain is not equal to that of the manufactures which\nthey import for their own use, and for that of some of the other colonies,\nto which they are the carriers. A balance, therefore, must be paid to the\nmother-country in gold and silver and this balance they generally find.\nIn the sugar colonies, the value of the produce annually exported to Great\nBritain is much greater than that of all the goods imported from thence.\nIf the sugar and rum annually sent to the mother-country were paid for in\nthose colonies, Great Britain would be obliged to send out, every year, a\nvery large balance in money; and the trade to the West Indies would, by a\ncertain species of politicians, be considered as extremely\ndisadvantageous. But it so happens, that many of the principal proprietors\nof the sugar plantations reside in Great Britain. Their rents are remitted\nto them in sugar and rum, the produce of their estates. The sugar and rum\nwhich the West India merchants purchase in those colonies upon their own\naccount, are not equal in value to the goods which they annually sell\nthere. A balance, therefore, must necessarily be paid to them in gold and\nsilver, and this balance, too, is generally found.\nThe difficulty and irregularity of payment from the different colonies to\nGreat Britain, have not been at all in proportion to the greatness or\nsmallness of the balances which were respectively due from them. Payments\nhave, in general, been more regular from the northern than from the\ntobacco colonies, though the former have generally paid a pretty large\nbalance in money, while the latter have either paid no balance, or a much\nsmaller one. The difficulty of getting payment from our different sugar\ncolonies has been greater or less in proportion, not so much to the extent\nof the balances respectively due from them, as to the quantity of\nuncultivated land which they contained; that is, to the greater or smaller\ntemptation which the planters have been under of over-trading, or of\nundertaking the settlement and plantation of greater quantities of waste\nland than suited the extent of their capitals. The returns from the great\nisland of Jamaica, where there is still much uncultivated land, have, upon\nthis account, been, in general, more irregular and uncertain than those\nfrom the smaller islands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Christopher\u2019s,\nwhich have, for these many years, been completely cultivated, and have,\nupon that account, afforded less field for the speculations of the\nplanter. The new acquisitions of Grenada, Tobago, St. Vincent\u2019s, and\nDominica, have opened a new field for speculations of this kind; and the\nreturns from those islands have of late been as irregular and uncertain\nas those from the great island of Jamaica.\nIt is not, therefore, the poverty of the colonies which occasions, in the\ngreater part of them, the present scarcity of gold and silver money. Their\ngreat demand for active and productive stock makes it convenient for them\nto have as little dead stock as possible, and disposes them, upon that\naccount, to content themselves with a cheaper, though less commodious\ninstrument of commerce, than gold and silver. They are thereby enabled to\nconvert the value of that gold and silver into the instruments of trade,\ninto the materials of clothing, into household furniture, and into the\niron work necessary for building and extending their settlements and\nplantations. In those branches of business which cannot be transacted\nwithout gold and silver money, it appears, that they can always find the\nnecessary quantity of those metals; and if they frequently do not find it,\ntheir failure is generally the effect, not of their necessary poverty, but\nof their unnecessary and excessive enterprise. It is not because they are\npoor that their payments are irregular and uncertain, but because they are\ntoo eager to become excessively rich. Though all that part of the produce\nof the colony taxes, which was over and above what was necessary for\ndefraying the expense of their own civil and military establishments, were\nto be remitted to Great Britain in gold and silver, the colonies have\nabundantly wherewithal to purchase the requisite quantity of those metals.\nThey would in this case be obliged, indeed, to exchange a part of their\nsurplus produce, with which they now purchase active and productive stock,\nfor dead stock. In transacting their domestic business, they would be\nobliged to employ a costly, instead of a cheap instrument of commerce; and\nthe expense of purchasing this costly instrument might damp somewhat the\nvivacity and ardour of their excessive enterprise in the improvement of\nland. It might not, however, be necessary to remit any part of the\nAmerican revenue in gold and silver. It might be remitted in bills drawn\nupon, and accepted by, particular merchants or companies in Great Britain,\nto whom a part of the surplus produce of America had been consigned, who\nwould pay into the treasury the American revenue in money, after having\nthemselves received the value of it in goods; and the whole business might\nfrequently be transacted without exporting a single ounce of gold or\nsilver from America.\nIt is not contrary to justice, that both Ireland and America should\ncontribute towards the discharge of the public debt of Great Britain. That\ndebt has been contracted in support of the government established by the\nRevolution; a government to which the protestants of Ireland owe, not only\nthe whole authority which they at present enjoy in their own country, but\nevery security which they possess for their liberty, their property, and\ntheir religion; a government to which several of the colonies of America\nowe their present charters, and consequently their present constitution;\nand to which all the colonies of America owe the liberty, security, and\nproperty, which they have ever since enjoyed. That public debt has been\ncontracted in the defence, not of Great Britain alone, but of all the\ndifferent provinces of the empire. The immense debt contracted in the late\nwar in particular, and a great part of that contracted in the war before,\nwere both properly contracted in defence of America.\nBy a union with Great Britain, Ireland would gain, besides the freedom of\ntrade, other advantages much more important, and which would much more\nthan compensate any increase of taxes that might accompany that union. By\nthe union with England, the middling and inferior ranks of people in\nScotland gained a complete deliverance from the power of an aristocracy,\nwhich had always before oppressed them. By a union with Great Britain, the\ngreater part of people of all ranks in Ireland would gain an equally\ncomplete deliverance from a much more oppressive aristocracy; an\naristocracy not founded, like that of Scotland, in the natural and\nrespectable distinctions of birth and fortune, but in the most odious of\nall distinctions, those of religious and political prejudices;\ndistinctions which, more than any other, animate both the insolence of the\noppressors, and the hatred and indignation of the oppressed, and which\ncommonly render the inhabitants of the same country more hostile to one\nanother than those of different countries ever are. Without a union with\nGreat Britain, the inhabitants of Ireland are not likely, for many ages,\nto consider themselves as one people.\nNo oppressive aristocracy has ever prevailed in the colonies. Even they,\nhowever, would, in point of happiness and tranquillity, gain considerably\nby a union with Great Britain. It would, at least, deliver them from those\nrancourous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small\ndemocracies, and which have so frequently divided the affections of their\npeople, and disturbed the tranquillity of their governments, in their form\nso nearly democratical. In the case of a total separation from Great\nBritain, which, unless prevented by a union of this kind, seems very\nlikely to take place, those factions would be ten times more virulent than\never. Before the commencement of the present disturbances, the coercive\npower of the mother-country had always been able to restrain those\nfactions from breaking out into any thing worse than gross brutality and\ninsult. If that coercive power were entirely taken away, they would\nprobably soon break out into open violence and bloodshed. In all great\ncountries which are united under one uniform government, the spirit of\nparty commonly prevails less in the remote provinces than in the centre of\nthe empire. The distance of those provinces from the capital, from the\nprincipal seat of the great scramble of faction and ambition, makes them\nenter less into the views of any of the contending parties, and renders\nthem more indifferent and impartial spectators of the conduct of all. The\nspirit of party prevails less in Scotland than in England. In the case of\na union, it would probably prevail less in Ireland than in Scotland; and\nthe colonies would probably soon enjoy a degree of concord and unanimity,\nat present unknown in any part of the British empire. Both Ireland and the\ncolonies, indeed, would be subjected to heavier taxes than any which they\nat present pay. In consequence, however, of a diligent and faithful\napplication of the public revenue towards the discharge of the national\ndebt, the greater part of those taxes might not be of long continuance,\nand the public revenue of Great Britain might soon be reduced to what was\nnecessary for maintaining a moderate peace-establishment.\nThe territorial acquisitions of the East India Company, the undoubted\nright of the Crown, that is, of the state and people of Great Britain,\nmight be rendered another source of revenue, more abundant, perhaps, than\nall those already mentioned. Those countries are represented as more\nfertile, more extensive, and, in proportion to their extent, much richer\nand more populous than Great Britain. In order to draw a great revenue\nfrom them, it would not probably be necessary to introduce any new system\nof taxation into countries which are already sufficiently, and more than\nsufficiently, taxed. It might, perhaps, be more proper to lighten than to\naggravate the burden of those unfortunate countries, and to endeavour to\ndraw a revenue from them, not by imposing new taxes, but by preventing the\nembezzlement and misapplication of the greater part of those which they\nalready pay.\nIf it should be found impracticable for Great Britain to draw any\nconsiderable augmentation of revenue from any of the resources above\nmentioned, the only resource which can remain to her, is a diminution of\nher expense. In the mode of collecting and in that of expending the public\nrevenue, though in both there may be still room for improvement, Great\nBritain seems to be at least as economical as any of her neighbours. The\nmilitary establishment which she maintains for her own defence in time of\npeace, is more moderate than that of any European state, which can pretend\nto rival her either in wealth or in power. None of these articles,\ntherefore, seem to admit of any considerable reduction of expense. The\nexpense of the peace-establishment of the colonies was, before the\ncommencement of the present disturbances, very considerable, and is an\nexpense which may, and, if no revenue can be drawn from them, ought\ncertainly to be saved altogether. This constant expense in time of peace,\nthough very great, is insignificant in comparison with what the defence of\nthe colonies has cost us in time of war. The last war, which was\nundertaken altogether on account of the colonies, cost Great Britain, it\nhas already been observed, upwards of ninety millions. The Spanish war of\n1739 was principally undertaken on their account; in which, and in the\nFrench war that was the consequence of it, Great Britain, spent upwards of\nforty millions; a great part of which ought justly to be charged to the\ncolonies. In those two wars, the colonies cost Great Britain much more\nthan double the sum which the national debt amounted to before the\ncommencement of the first of them. Had it not been for those wars, that\ndebt might, and probably would by this time, have been completely paid;\nand had it not been for the colonies, the former of those wars might not,\nand the latter certainly would not, have been undertaken. It was because\nthe colonies were supposed to be provinces of the British Empire, that\nthis expense was laid out upon them. But countries which contribute\nneither revenue nor military force towards the support of the empire,\ncannot be considered as provinces. They may, perhaps, be considered as\nappendages, as a sort of splendid and shewy equipage of the empire. But if\nthe empire can no longer support the expense of keeping up this equipage,\nit ought certainly to lay it down; and if it cannot raise its revenue in\nproportion to its expense, it ought at least to accommodate its expense to\nits revenue. If the colonies, notwithstanding their refusal to submit to\nBritish taxes, are still to be considered as provinces of the British\nempire, their defence, in some future war, may cost Great Britain as great\nan expense as it ever has done in any former war. The rulers of Great\nBritain have, for more than a century past, amused the people with the\nimagination that they possessed a great empire on the west side of the\nAtlantic. This empire, however, has hitherto existed in imagination only.\nIt has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a\ngold mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has cost, which\ncontinues to cost, and which, if pursued in the same way as it has been\nhitherto, is likely to cost, immense expense, without being likely to\nbring any profit; for the effects of the monopoly of the colony trade, it\nhas been shewn, are to the great body of the people, mere loss instead of\nprofit. It is surely now time that our rulers should either realize this\ngolden dream, in which they have been indulging themselves, perhaps, as\nwell as the people; or that they should awake from it themselves, and\nendeavour to awaken the people. If the project cannot be completed, it\nought to be given up. If any of the provinces of the British empire cannot\nbe made to contribute towards the support of the whole empire, it is\nsurely time that Great Britain should free herself from the expense of\ndefending those provinces in time of war, and of supporting any part of\ntheir civil or military establishment in time of peace; and endeavour to\naccommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her\ncircumstances.", "source": "wealth_of_nations.txt"}

I.\n_Of_ SYMPATHY.\nHow selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some\nprinciples in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others,\nand render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing\nfrom it, except the pleasure of seeing it. Of this kind is pity or\ncompassion, the emotion which we feel for the misery of others, when we\neither see it, or are made to conceive it in a very lively manner. That\nwe often derive sorrow from the sorrow of others, is a matter of fact\ntoo obvious to require any instances to prove it; for this sentiment,\nlike all the other original passions of human nature, is by no means\nconfined to the virtuous and humane, though they perhaps may feel it\nwith the most exquisite sensibility. The greatest ruffian, the most\nhardened violator of the laws of society, is not altogether without it.\nAs we have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we can form\nno idea of the manner in which they are affected, but by conceiving what\nwe ourselves should feel in the like situation. Though our brother is\nupon the rack, as long as we ourselves are at our ease, our senses will\nnever inform us of what he suffers. They never did and never can carry\nus beyond our own person, and it is by the imagination only that we can\nform any conception of what are his sensations. Neither can that faculty\nhelp us to this any other way, than by representing to us what would be\nour own, if we were in his case. It is the impressions of our own senses\nonly, not those of his, which our imaginations copy. By the imagination\nwe place ourselves in his situation, we conceive ourselves enduring all\nthe same torments, we enter as it were into his body and become in some\nmeasure him, and thence form some idea of his sensations and even feel\nsomething which, though weaker in degree, is not altogether unlike them.\nHis agonies, when they are thus brought home to ourselves, when we have\nthus adopted and made them our own, begin at last to affect us, and we\nthen tremble and shudder at the thought of what he feels. For as to be\nin pain or distress of any kind excites the most excessive sorrow, so to\nconceive or to imagine that we are in it, excites some degree of the\nsame emotion, in proportion to the vivacity or dullness of the\nconception.\nThat this is the source of our fellow-feeling for the misery of others,\nthat it is by changing places in fancy with the sufferer, that we come\neither to conceive or to be affected by what he feels, may be\ndemonstrated by many obvious observations, if it should not be thought\nsufficiently evident of itself. When we see a stroke aimed and just\nready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person, we naturally shrink\nand draw back our own leg or our own arm; and when it does fall, we feel\nit in some measure, and are hurt by it as well as the sufferer. The mob,\nwhen they are gazing at a dancer on the slack rope, naturally writhe and\ntwist and balance their own bodies, as they see him do, and as they feel\nthat they themselves must do if in his situation. Persons of delicate\nfibres and a weak constitution of body, complain that in looking on the\nsores and ulcers which are exposed by beggars in the streets, they are\napt to feel an itching or uneasy sensation in the correspondent part of\ntheir own bodies. The horror which they conceive at the misery of those\nwretches affects that particular part in themselves more than any other;\nbecause that horror arises from conceiving what they themselves would\nsuffer, if they really were the wretches whom they are looking upon, and\nif that particular part in themselves was actually affected in the same\nmiserable manner. The very force of this conception is sufficient, in\ntheir feeble frames, to produce that itching or uneasy sensation\ncomplained of. Men of the most robust make, observe that in looking upon\nsore eyes they often feel a very sensible soreness in their own, which\nproceeds from the same reason; that organ being in the strongest man\nmore delicate than any other part of the body is in the weakest.\nNeither is it those circumstances only, which create pain or sorrow,\nthat call forth our fellow-feeling. Whatever is the passion which arises\nfrom any object in the person principally concerned, an analogous\nemotion springs up, at the thought of his situation, in the breast of\nevery attentive spectator. Our joy for the deliverance of those heroes\nof tragedy or romance who interest us, is as sincere as our grief for\ntheir distress, and our fellow-feeling with their misery is not more\nreal than that with their happiness. We enter into their gratitude\ntowards those faithful friends who did not desert them in their\ndifficulties; and we heartily go along with their resentment against\nthose perfidious traitors who injured, abandoned, or deceived them. In\nevery passion of which the mind of man is susceptible, the emotions of\nthe by-stander always correspond to what, by bringing the case home to\nhimself, he imagines, should be the sentiments of the sufferer.\nPity and compassion are words appropriated to signify our fellow-feeling\nwith the sorrow of others. Sympathy, though its meaning was, perhaps,\noriginally the same, may now, however, without much impropriety, be made\nuse of to denote our fellow-feeling with any passion whatever.\nUpon some occasions sympathy may seem to arise merely from the view of a\ncertain emotion in another person. The passions, upon some occasions,\nmay seem to be transfused from one man to another, instantaneously, and\nantecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the person\nprincipally concerned. Grief and joy, for example, strongly expressed in\nthe look and gestures of any one, at once affect the spectator with some\ndegree of a like painful or agreeable emotion. A smiling face is, to\nevery body that sees it, a chearful object; as a sorrowful countenance,\non the other hand, is a melancholy one.\nThis, however, does not hold universally, or with regard to every\npassion. There are some passions of which the expressions excite no sort\nof sympathy, but before we are acquainted with what gave occasion to\nthem, serve rather to disgust and provoke us against them. The furious\nbehavior of an angry man is more likely to exasperate us against himself\nthan against his enemies. As we are unacquainted with his provocation,\nwe cannot bring his case home to ourselves, nor conceive any thing like\nthe passions which it excites. But we plainly see what is the situation\nof those with whom he is angry, and to what violence they may be exposed\nfrom so enraged an adversary. We readily, therefore, sympathize with\ntheir fear or resentment, and are immediately disposed to take part\nagainst the man from whom they appear to be in so much danger.\nIf the very appearances of grief and joy inspire us with some degree of\nthe like emotions, it is because they suggest to us the general idea of\nsome good or bad fortune that has befallen the person in whom we observe\nthem: and in these passions this is sufficient to have some little\ninfluence upon us. The effects of grief and joy terminate in the person\nwho feels those emotions, of which the expressions do not, like those of\nresentment, suggest to us the idea of any other person for whom we are\nconcerned, and whose interests are opposite to his. The general idea of\ngood or bad fortune, therefore, creates some concern for the person who\nhas met with it, but the general idea of provocation excites no sympathy\nwith the anger of the man who has received it. Nature, it seems, teaches\nus to be more averse to enter into this passion, and, till informed of\nits cause, to be disposed rather to take part against it.\nEven our sympathy with the grief or joy of another, before we are\ninformed of the cause of either, is always extremely imperfect. General\nlamentations, which express nothing but the anguish of the sufferer,\ncreate rather a curiosity to inquire into his situation, along with some\ndisposition to sympathize with him, than any actual sympathy that is\nvery sensible. The first question which we ask is, What has befallen\nyou? Till this be answered, tho\u2019 we are uneasy both from the vague idea\nof his misfortune, and still more from torturing ourselves with\nconjectures about what it may be, yet our fellow-feeling is not very\nconsiderable.\nSympathy, therefore, does not arise so much from the view of the\npassion, as from that of the situation which excites it. We sometimes\nfeel for another, a passion of which he himself seems to be altogether\nincapable; because when we put ourselves in his case, that passion\narises in our breast from the imagination, though it does not in his\nfrom the reality. We blush for the impudence and rudeness of another,\nthough he himself appears to have no sense of the impropriety of his own\nbehavior; because we cannot help feeling with what confusion we\nourselves should be covered, had we behaved in so absurd a manner.\nOf all the calamities to which the condition of mortality exposes\nmankind, the loss of reason appears, to those who have the least spark\nof humanity, by far the most dreadful, and they behold that last stage\nof human wretchedness with deeper commiseration than any other. But the\npoor wretch, who is in it, laughs and sings perhaps, and is altogether\ninsensible of his own misery. The anguish which humanity feels,\ntherefore, at the sight of such an object, cannot be the reflection of\nany sentiment of the sufferer. The compassion of the spectator must\narise altogether from the consideration of what he himself would feel if\nhe was reduced to the same unhappy situation, and, what perhaps is\nimpossible, was at the same time able to regard it with his present\nreason and judgment.\nWhat are the pangs of a mother when she hears the moanings of her infant\nthat during the agony of disease cannot express what it feels? In her\nidea of what it suffers, she joins, to its real helplessness, her own\nconsciousness of that helplessness, and her own terrors for the unknown\nconsequences of its disorder; and out of all these, forms, for her own\nsorrow, the most complete image of misery and distress. The infant,\nhowever, feels only the uneasiness of the present instant, which can\nnever be great. With regard to the future it is perfectly secure, and in\nits thoughtlessness and want of foresight possesses an antidote against\nfear and anxiety, the great tormentors of the human breast, from which\nreason and philosophy will in vain attempt to defend it when it grows up\nto a man.\nWe sympathize even with the dead, and overlooking what is of real\nimportance in their situation, that awful futurity which awaits them, we\nare chiefly affected by those circumstances which strike our senses, but\ncan have no influence upon their happiness. It is miserable, we think,\nto be deprived of the light of the sun; to be shut out from life and\nconversation; to be laid in the cold grave, a prey to corruption and the\nreptiles of the earth; to be no more thought of in this world, but to be\nobliterated in a little time from the affections and almost from the\nmemory of their dearest friends and relations. Surely, we imagine, we\ncan never feel too much for those who have suffered so dreadful a\ncalamity. The tribute of our fellow-feeling seems doubly due to them\nnow, when they are in danger of being forgot by every body; and, by the\nvain honors which we pay to their memory, we endeavor, for our own\nmisery, artificially to keep alive our melancholy remembrance of their\nmisfortune. That our sympathy can afford them no consolation seems to be\nan addition to their calamity; and to think that all we can do is\nunavailing, and that, what alleviates all other distress, the regret,\nthe love, and the lamentations of their friends, can yield no comfort to\nthem, serves only to exasperate our sense of their misery. The happiness\nof the dead, however, most assuredly, is affected by none of these\ncircumstances; nor is it the thought of these things which can ever\ndisturb the profound security of their repose. The idea of that dreary\nand endless melancholy, which the fancy naturally ascribes to their\ncondition, arises altogether from our joining to the change which has\nbeen produced upon them, our own consciousness of that change, from our\nputting ourselves in their situation, and from our lodging, if I may be\nallowed to say so, our own living souls in their inanimated bodies, and\nthence conceiving what would be our emotions in this case. It is from\nthis very illusion of the imagination, that the foresight of our own\ndissolution is so terrible to us, and that the idea of those\ncircumstances, which undoubtedly can give us no pain when we are dead,\nmakes us miserable while we are alive. And from thence arises one of the\nmost important principles in human nature, the dread of death, the great\npoison to the happiness, but the great restraint upon the injustice of\nmankind, which, while it afflicts and mortifies the individual, guards\nand protects the society.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of the Pleasure of mutual Sympathy._\nBut whatever may be the cause of sympathy, or however it may be excited,\nnothing pleases us more than to observe in other men a fellow-feeling\nwith all the emotions of our own breast; nor are we ever so much shocked\nas by the appearance of the contrary. Those who are fond of deducing all\nour sentiments from certain refinements of self-love, think themselves\nat no loss to account, according to their own principles, both for this\npleasure and this pain. Man, say they, conscious of his own weakness and\nof the need which he has for the assistance of others, rejoices whenever\nhe observes that they adopt his own passions, because he is then assured\nof that assistance; and grieves whenever he observes the contrary,\nbecause he is then assured of their opposition. But both the pleasure\nand the pain are always felt so instantaneously, and often upon such\nfrivolous occasions, that it seems evident that neither of them can be\nderived from any such self-interested consideration. A man is mortified\nwhen, after having endeavored to divert the company, he looks round and\nsees that no body laughs at his jests but himself. On the contrary, the\nmirth of the company is highly agreeable to him, and he regards this\ncorrespondence of their sentiments with his own as the greatest\napplause.\nNeither does his pleasure seem to arise altogether from the additional\nvivacity which his mirth may receive from sympathy with theirs, nor his\npain from the disappointment he meets with when he misses this pleasure;\nthough both the one and the other, no doubt, do in some measure. When we\nhave read a book or poem so often that we can no longer find any\namusement in reading it by ourselves, we can still take pleasure in\nreading it to a companion. To him it has all the graces of novelty; we\nenter into the surprise and admiration which it naturally excites in\nhim, but which it is no longer capable of exciting in us; we consider\nall the ideas which it presents rather in the light in which they appear\nto him, than in that in which they appear to ourselves, and we are\namused by sympathy with his amusement which thus enlivens our own. On\nthe contrary, we should be vexed if he did not seem to be entertained\nwith it, and we could no longer take any pleasure in reading it to him.\nIt is the same case here. The mirth of the company, no doubt, enlivens\nour own mirth, and their silence, no doubt, disappoints us. But though\nthis may contribute both to the pleasure which we derive from the one,\nand to the pain which we feel from the other, it is by no means the sole\ncause of either; and this correspondence of the sentiments of others\nwith our own appears to be a cause of pleasure, and the want of it a\ncause of pain, which cannot be accounted for in this manner. The\nsympathy, which my friends express with my joy, might, indeed, give me\npleasure by enlivening that joy: but that which they express with my\ngrief could give me none, if it served only to enliven that grief.\nSympathy, however, enlivens joy and alleviates grief. It enlivens joy by\npresenting another source of satisfaction; and it alleviates grief by\ninsinuating into the heart almost the only agreeable sensation which it\nis at that time capable of receiving.\nIt is to be observed accordingly, that we are still more anxious to\ncommunicate to our friends our disagreeable than our agreeable passions,\nthat we derive still more satisfaction from their sympathy with the\nformer than from that with the latter, and that we are still more\nshocked by the want of it.\nHow are the unfortunate relieved when they have sound out a person to\nwhom they can communicate the cause of their sorrow? Upon his sympathy\nthey seem to disburthen themselves of a part of their distress: he is\nnot improperly said to share it with them. He not only feels a sorrow of\nthe same kind with that which they feel, but as if he had derived a part\nof it to himself, what he feels seems to alleviate the weight of what\nthey feel. Yet by relating their misfortunes, they in some measure renew\ntheir grief. They awaken in their memory the remembrance of those\ncircumstances which occasion their affliction. Their tears accordingly\nflow faster than before, and they are apt to abandon themselves to all\nthe weakness of sorrow. They take pleasure, however, in all this, and,\nit is evident, are sensibly relieved by it; because the sweetness of his\nsympathy more than compensates the bitterness of that sorrow, which, in\norder to excite that sympathy, they had thus enlivened and renewed. The\ncruelest insult, on the contrary, which can be offered to the\nunfortunate, is to appear to make light of their calamities. To seem not\nto be affected with the joy of our companions is but want of politeness;\nbut not to wear a serious countenance when they tell us their\nafflictions, is real and gross inhumanity.\nLove is an agreeable, resentment a disagreeable passion; and accordingly\nwe are not half so anxious that our friends should adopt our\nfriendships, as that they should enter into our resentments. We can\nforgive them though they seem to be little affected with the favors\nwhich we may have received, but lose all patience if they seem\nindifferent about the injuries which may have been done to us: nor are\nwe half so angry with them for not entering into our gratitude, as for\nnot sympathizing with our resentment. They can easily avoid being\nfriends to our friends, but can hardly avoid being enemies to those with\nwhom we are at variance. We seldom resent their being at enmity with the\nfirst, though upon that account we may sometimes affect to make an\nawkward quarrel with them; but we quarrel with them in good earnest if\nthey live in friendship with the last. The agreeable passions of love\nand joy can satisfy and support the heart without any auxiliary\npleasure. The bitter and painful emotions of grief and resentment more\nstrongly require the healing consolation of sympathy.\nAs the person who is principally interested in any event is pleased with\nour sympathy, and hurt by the want of it, so we, too, seem to be pleased\nwhen we are able to sympathize with him, and to be hurt when we are\nunable to do so. We run not only to congratulate the successful, but to\ncondole with the afflicted; and the pleasure which we find in the\nconversation of one whom in all the passions of his heart we can\nentirely sympathize with, seems to do more than compensate the\npainfulness of that sorrow with which the view of his situation affects\nus. On the contrary, it is always disagreeable to feel that we cannot\nsympathize with him, and instead of being pleased with this exemption\nfrom sympathetic pain, it hurts us to find that we cannot share his\nuneasiness. If we hear a person loudly lamenting his misfortunes, which,\nhowever, upon bringing the case home to ourselves, we feel, can produce\nno such violent effect upon us, we are shocked at his grief; and,\nbecause we cannot enter into it, call it pusillanimity and weakness. It\ngives us the spleen, on the other hand, to see another too happy or too\nmuch elevated, as we call it, with any little piece of good fortune. We\nare disobliged even with his joy, and, because we cannot go along with\nit, call it levity and folly. We are even put out of humor if our\ncompanion laughs louder or longer at a joke than we think it deserves;\nthat is, than we feel that we ourselves could laugh at it.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of the manner in which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of the\naffections of other men, by their concord or dissonance with our own._\nWhen the original passions of the person principally concerned are in\nperfect concord with the sympathetic emotions of the spectator, they\nnecessarily appear to this last just and proper, and suitable to their\nobjects; and, on the contrary, when, upon bringing the case home to\nhimself, he finds that they do not coincide with what he feels, they\nnecessarily appear to him unjust and improper, and unsuitable to the\ncauses which excite them. To approve of the passions of another,\ntherefore, as suitable to their objects, is the same thing as to observe\nthat we entirely sympathize with them; and not to approve of them as\nsuch, is the same thing as to observe that we do not entirely sympathize\nwith them. The man who resents the injuries that have been done to me,\nand observes that I resent them precisely as he does, necessarily\napproves of my resentment. The man whose sympathy keeps time to my\ngrief, cannot but admit the reasonableness of my sorrow. He who admires\nthe same poem, or the same picture, and admires them exactly as I do,\nmust surely allow the justness of my admiration. He who laughs at the\nsame joke, and laughs along with me, cannot well deny the propriety of\nmy laughter. On the contrary, the person who, upon these different\noccasions, either feels no such emotion as that which I feel, or feels\nnone that bears any proportion to mine, cannot avoid disapproving my\nsentiments on account of their dissonance with his own. If my animosity\ngoes beyond what the indignation of my friend can correspond to; if my\ngrief exceeds what his most tender compassion can go along with; if my\nadmiration is either too high or too low to tally with his own; if I\nlaugh loud and heartily when he only smiles, or, on the contrary, only\nsmile when he laughs loud and heartily; in all these cases, as soon as\nhe comes from considering the object, to observe how I am affected by\nit, according as there is more or less disproportion between his\nsentiments and mine, I must incur a greater or less degree of his\ndisapprobation: and upon all occasions his own sentiments are the\nstandards and measures by which he judges of mine.\nTo approve of another man\u2019s opinions is to adopt those opinions, and to\nadopt them is to approve of them. If the same arguments which convince\nyou convince me likewise, I necessarily approve of your conviction; and\nif they do not, I necessarily disapprove of it: neither can I possibly\nconceive that I should do the one without the other. To approve or\ndisapprove, therefore, of the opinions of others is acknowledged, by\nevery body, to mean no more than to observe their agreement or\ndisagreement with our own. But this is equally the case with regard to\nour approbation or disapprobation of the sentiments or passions of\nothers.\nThere are, indeed, some cases in which we seem to approve without any\nsympathy or correspondence of sentiments, and in which, consequently,\nthe sentiment of approbation would seem to be different from the\nperception of this coincidence. A little attention, however, will\nconvince us that even in these cases our approbation is ultimately\nfounded upon a sympathy or correspondence of this kind. I shall give an\ninstance in things of a very frivolous nature, because in them the\njudgments of mankind are less apt to be perverted by wrong systems. We\nmay often approve of a jest, and think the laughter of the company quite\njust and proper, though we ourselves do not laugh, because, perhaps, we\nare in a grave humour, or happen to have our attention engaged with\nother objects. We have learned, however, from experience, what sort of\npleasantry as upon most occasions capable of making us laugh, and we\nobserve that this is one of that kind. We approve, therefore, of the\nlaughter of the company, and feel that it is natural and suitable to its\nobject; because, though in our present mood we cannot easily enter into\nit, we are sensible that upon most occasions we should very heartily\njoin in it.\nThe same thing often happens with regard to all the other passions. A\nstranger passes by us in the street with all the marks of the deepest\naffliction; and we are immediately told that he has just received the\nnews of the death of his father. It is impossible that, in this case, we\nshould not approve of his grief. Yet it may often happen, without any\ndefect of humanity on our part, that, so far from entering into the\nviolence of his sorrow, we should scarce conceive the first movements of\nconcern upon his account. Both he and his father, perhaps, are intirely\nunknown to us, or we happen to be employed about other things, and do\nnot take time to picture out in our imagination the different\ncircumstances of distress which must occur to him. We have learned,\nhowever, from experience, that such a misfortune naturally excites such\na degree of sorrow, and we know that if we took time to consider his\nsituation, fully and in all its parts, we should, without doubt, most\nsincerely sympathize with him. It is upon the consciousness of this\nconditional sympathy, that our approbation of his sorrow is founded,\neven in those cases in which that sympathy does not actually take place;\nand the general rules derived from our preceding experience of what our\nsentiments would commonly correspond with, correct upon this, as upon\nmany other occasions, the impropriety of our present emotions.\nThe sentiment or affection of the heart from which any action proceeds,\nand upon which its whole virtue or vice must ultimately depend, may be\nconsidered under two different aspects, or in two different relations;\nfirst, in relation to the cause which excites it, or the motive which\ngives occasion to it; and secondly, in relation to the end which it\nproposes, or the effect which it tends to produce.\nIn the suitableness or unsuitableness, in the proportion or\ndisproportion which the affection seems to bear to the cause or object\nwhich excites it, consists the propriety or impropriety, the decency or\nungracefulness of the consequent action.\nIn the beneficial or hurtful nature of the effects which the affection\naims at, or tends to produce, consists the merit or demerit of the\naction, the qualities by which it is entitled to reward, or is deserving\nof punishment.\nPhilosophers have, of late years, considered chiefly the tendency of\naffections, and have given little attention to the relation which they\nstand in to the cause which excites them. In common life, however, when\nwe judge of any person\u2019s conduct, and of the sentiments which directed\nit, we constantly consider them under both these aspects. When we blame\nin another man the excesses of love, of grief, of resentment, we not\nonly consider the ruinous effects which they tend to produce, but the\nlittle occasion which was given for them. The merit of his favourite, we\nsay, is not so great, his misfortune is not so dreadful, his provocation\nis not so extraordinary, as to justify so violent a passion. We should\nhave indulged, we say; perhaps, have approved of the violence of his\nemotion, had the cause been in any respect proportioned to it.\nWhen we judge in this manner of any affection, as proportioned or\ndisproportioned to the cause which excites it, it is scarce possible\nthat we should make use of any other rule or canon but the correspondent\naffection in ourselves. If, upon bringing the case home to our own\nbreast, we find that the sentiments which it gives occasion to, coincide\nand tally with our own, we necessarily approve of them as proportioned\nand suitable to their objects; if otherwise, we necessarily disapprove\nof them, as extravagant and out of proportion.\nEvery faculty in one man is the measure by which he judges of the like\nfaculty in another. I judge of your sight by my sight, of your ear by my\near, of your reason by my reason, of your resentment by my resentment,\nof your love by my love. I neither have nor can have any other way of\njudging about them.\nCHAP. IV.\n_The same subject continued._\nWe may judge of the propriety or impropriety of the sentiments of\nanother person by their correspondence or disagreement with our own,\nupon two different occasions; either, first, when the objects which\nexcite them are considered without any peculiar relation, either to\nthemselves or to the person whose sentiments we judge of; or, secondly,\nwhen they are considered as peculiarly affecting one or other of us.\n1. With regard to those objects which are considered without any\npeculiar relation either to ourselves or to the person whose sentiments\nwe judge of; wherever his sentiments intirely correspond with our own,\nwe ascribe to him the qualities of taste and good judgment. The beauty\nof a plain, the greatness of a mountain, the ornaments of a building,\nthe expression of a picture, the composition of a discourse, the conduct\nof a third person, the proportions of different quantities and numbers,\nthe various appearances which the great machine of the universe is\nperpetually exhibiting, with the secret wheels and springs which produce\nthem; all the general subjects of science and taste, are what we and our\ncompanions regard, as having no peculiar relation to either of us. We\nboth look at them from the same point of view, and we have no occasion\nfor sympathy, or for that imaginary change of situations from which it\narises, in order to produce, with regard to these, the most perfect\nharmony of sentiments and affections. If, notwithstanding, we are often\ndifferently affected, it arises either from the different degrees of\nattention, which our different habits of life allow us to give easily to\nthe several parts of those complex objects, or from the different\ndegrees of natural acuteness in the faculty of the mind to which they\nare addressed.\nWhen the sentiments of our companion coincide with our own in things of\nthis kind, which are obvious and easy, and in which, perhaps, we never\nfound a single person who differed from us, though we, no doubt, must\napprove of them, yet he seems to deserve no praise or admiration on\naccount of them. But when they not only coincide with our own, but lead\nand direct our own; when in forming them he appears to have attended to\nmany things which we had overlooked, and to have adjusted them to all\nthe various circumstances of their objects; we not only approve of them,\nbut wonder and are surprised at their uncommon and unexpected acuteness\nand comprehensiveness, and he appears to deserve a very high degree of\nadmiration and applause. For approbation heightened by wonder and\nsurprise, constitutes the sentiment which is properly palled admiration,\nand of which applause is the natural expression. The decision of the man\nwho judges that exquisite beauty is preferable to the grossest\ndeformity, or that twice two are equal to four, must certainly be\napproved of by all the world, but will not, surely, be much admired. It\nis the acute and delicate discernment of the man of taste, who\ndistinguishes the minute, and scarce perceptible, differences of beauty\nand deformity; it is the comprehensive accuracy of the experienced\nmathematician, who unravels, with ease, the most intricate and perplexed\nproportions; it is the great leader in science and taste, the man who\ndirects and conducts our own sentiments, the extent and superior\njustness of whole talents astonish us with wonder and surprise, who\nexcites our admiration and seems to deserve our applause: and upon this\nfoundation is grounded the greater part of the praise which is bestowed\nupon what are called the intellectual virtues.\nThe utility of those qualities, it may be thought, is what first\nrecommends them to us; and, no doubt, the consideration of this, when we\ncome to attend to it, gives them a new value. Originally, however, we\napprove of another man\u2019s judgment, not as something useful, but as\nright, as accurate, as agreeable to truth and reality: and it is evident\nwe attribute those qualities to it for no other reason but because we\nfind that it agrees with our own. Taste, in the same manner, is\noriginally approved of, not as useful, but as just, as delicate, and as\nprecisely suited to its object. The idea of the utility of all qualities\nof this kind, is plainly an after-thought, and not what first\nrecommended them to our approbation.\n2. With regard to those objects, which affect in a particular manner\neither ourselves or the person whose sentiments we judge of, it is at\nonce more difficult to preserve this harmony and correspondence, and at\nthe same time, vastly more important. My companion does not naturally\nlook upon the misfortune that has befallen me, or the injury that has\nbeen done me, from the same point of view in which I consider them. They\naffect me much more nearly. We do not view them from the same station,\nas we do a picture, or a poem, or a system of philosophy, and are,\ntherefore, apt to be very differently affected by them. But I can much\nmore easily overlook the want of this correspondence of sentiments with\nregard to such indifferent objects as concern neither me nor my\ncompanion, than with regard to what interests me so much as the\nmisfortune that has befallen me, or the injury that has been done me.\nThough you despise that picture, or that poem, or even that system of\nphilosophy, which I admire, there is little danger of our quarrelling\nupon that account. Neither of us can reasonably be much interested about\nthem. They ought all of them to be matters of great indifference to us\nboth; so that, though our opinions may be opposite, our affections may\nstill be very nearly the same. But it is quite otherwise with regard to\nthose objects by which either you or I are particularly affected. Though\nyour judgment in matters of speculation, though your sentiments in\nmatters of taste, are quite opposite to mine, I can easily overlook this\nopposition; and if I have any degree of temper, I may still find some\nentertainment in your conversation, even upon those very subjects. But\nif you have either no fellow-feeling for the misfortunes I have met\nwith, or none that bears any proportion to the grief which distracts me,\nor if you have either no indignation at the injuries I have suffered, or\nnone that bears any proportion to the resentment which transports me, we\ncan no longer converse upon these subjects. We become intolerable to one\nanother. I can neither support your company, nor you mine. You are\nconfounded at my violence and passion, and I am enraged at your cold\ninsensibility and want of feeling.\nIn all such cases, that there may be some correspondence of sentiments\nbetween the spectator and the person principally concerned, the\nspectator must, first of all, endeavour, as much as he can, to put\nhimself in the situation of the other, and to bring home to himself\nevery little circumstance of distress which can possibly occur to the\nsufferer. He must adopt the whole case of his companion with all its\nminutest incidents; and strive to render as perfect as possible, that\nimaginary change of situation upon which his sympathy is founded.\nAfter all this, however, the emotions of the spectator will still be\nvery apt to fall short of the violence of what is felt by the sufferer.\nMankind, though naturally sympathetic, never conceive, for what has\nbefallen another, that degree of passion which naturally animates the\nperson principally concerned. That imaginary change of situation, upon\nwhich their sympathy is founded, is but momentary. The thought of their\nown safety, the thought that they themselves are not really the\nsufferers, continually intrudes itself upon them; and though it does not\nhinder them from conceiving a passion somewhat analogous to what is felt\nby the sufferer, hinders them from conceiving any thing that approaches\nto the same degree of violence. The person principally concerned is\nsensible of this, and, at the same time passionately desires a more\ncomplete sympathy. He longs for that relief which nothing can afford him\nbut the entire concord of the affections of the spectators with his own.\nTo see the emotions of their hearts, in every respect, beat time to his\nown, in the violent and disagreeable passions, constitutes his sole\nconsolation. But he can only hope to obtain this by lowering his passion\nto that pitch, in which the spectators are capable of going along with\nhim. He must flatten, if I may be allowed to say so, the sharpness of\nits natural tone, in order to reduce it to harmony and concord with the\nemotions of those who are about him. What they feel, will, indeed,\nalways be, in some respects, different from what he feels, and\ncompassion can never be exactly the same with original sorrow; because\nthe secret consciousness that the change of situations, from which the\nsympathetic sentiment arises, is but imaginary, not only lowers it in\ndegree, but in some measure, varies it in kind, and gives it a quite\ndifferent modification. These two sentiments, however, may, it is\nevident, have such a correspondence with one another, as is sufficient\nfor the harmony of society. Though they will never be unisons, they may\nbe concords, and this is all that is wanted or required.\nIn order to produce this concord, as nature teaches the spectators to\nassume the circumstances of the person principally concerned, so she\nteaches this last in some measure to assume those of the spectators. As\nthey are continually placing themselves in this situation, and thence\nconceiving emotions similar to what he feels; so he is as constantly\nplacing himself in theirs, and thence conceiving some degree of that\ncoolness about his own fortune, with which he is sensible that they will\nview it. As they are constantly considering what they themselves would\nfeel, if they actually were the sufferers, so he is as constantly led to\nimagine in what manner he would be affected if he was only one of the\nspectators of his own situation. As their sympathy makes them look at\nit, in some measure, with his eyes, so his sympathy makes him look at\nit, in some measure, with theirs, especially when in their presence and\nacting under their observation: and as the reflected passion, which he\nthus conceives, is much weaker than the original one, it necessarily\nabates the violence of what he felt before he came into their presence,\nbefore he began to recollect in what manner they would be affected by\nit, and to view his situation in this candid and impartial light.\nThe mind, therefore, is rarely so disturbed, but that the company of a\nfriend will restore it to some degree of tranquillity and sedateness.\nThe breast is, in some measure, calmed and composed the moment we come\ninto his presence. We are immediately put in mind of the light in which\nhe will view our situation, and we begin to view it ourselves in the\nsame light; for the effect of sympathy is instantaneous. We expect less\nsympathy from a common acquaintance than from a friend: we cannot open\nto the former all those little circumstances which we can unfold to the\nlatter: we assume, therefore, more tranquillity before him, and\nendeavour to fix our thoughts upon those general outlines of our\nsituation which he is willing to consider. We expect still less sympathy\nfrom an assembly of strangers, and we assume, therefore, still more\ntranquillity before them, and always endeavour to bring down our passion\nto that pitch, which the particular company we are in may be expected to\ngo along with. Nor is this only an assumed appearance: for if we are at\nall masters of ourselves, the presence of a mere acquaintance will\nreally compose us, still more than that of a friend; and that of an\nassembly of strangers still more than that of an acquaintance.\nSociety and conversation, therefore, are the most powerful remedies for\nrestoring the mind to its tranquillity, if, at any time, it has\nunfortunately lost it; as well as the best preservatives of that equal\nand happy temper, which is so necessary to self-satisfaction and\nenjoyment. Men of retirement and speculation, who are apt to sit\nbrooding at home over either grief or resentment, though they may often\nhave more humanity, more generosity, and a nicer sense of honour, yet\nseldom possess that equality of temper which is so common among men of\nthe world.\nCHAP. V.\n_Of the amiable and respectable virtues._\nUpon these two different efforts, upon that of the spectator to enter\ninto the sentiments of the person principally concerned, and upon that\nof the person principally concerned, to bring down his emotions to what\nthe spectator can go along with, are founded two different sets of\nvirtues. The soft, the gentle, the amiable virtues, the virtues of\ncandid condescension and indulgent humanity, are founded upon the one:\nthe great, the awful and respectable, the virtues of self-denial, of\nself-government, of that command of the passions which subjects all the\nmovements of our nature to what our own dignity and honour, and the\npropriety of our own conduct require, derive their origin from the\nother.\nHow amiable does he appear to be, whose sympathetic heart seems to\nre-echo all the sentiments of those with whom he converses, who grieves\nfor their calamities, who resents their injuries, and rejoices at their\ngood fortune! When we bring home to ourselves the situation of his\ncompanions, we enter into their gratitude, and feel what consolation\nthey must derive from the tender sympathy of so affectionate a friend.\nAnd for a contrary reason, how disagreeable does he appear to be, whose\nhard and obdurate heart feels for himself only, but is altogether\ninsensible of the happiness or misery of others! We enter, in this case\ntoo, into the pain which his presence must give to every mortal with\nwhom he converses, to those especially with whom we are most apt to\nsympathize, the unfortunate and the injured.\nOn the other hand, what noble propriety and grace do we feel in the\nconduct of those who, in their own case, exert that recollection and\nself-command which constitute the dignity of every passion, and which\nbring it down to what others can enter into? We are disgusted with that\nclamorous grief, which, without any delicacy, calls upon our compassion\nwith sighs and tears and importunate lamentations. But we reverence that\nreserved, that silent and majestic sorrow, which discovers itself only\nin the swelling of the eyes, in the quivering of the lips and cheeks,\nand in the distant, but affecting, coldness of the whole behaviour. It\nimposes the like silence upon us. We regard it with respectful\nattention, and watch with anxious concern over our whole behaviour, lest\nby any impropriety we should disturb that concerted tranquillity, which\nit requires so great an effort to support.\nThe insolence and brutality of anger, in the same manner when we indulge\nits fury without check or restraint, is, of all subjects, the most\ndetestable. But we admire that noble and generous resentment which\ngoverns its pursuit of the greatest injuries, not by the rage which they\nare apt to excite in the breast of the sufferer, but by the indignation\nwhich they naturally call forth in that of the impartial spectator;\nwhich allows no word, no gesture, to escape it beyond what this more\nequitable sentiment would dictate; which never, even in thought,\nattempts any greater vengeance, nor desires to inflict any greater\npunishment, than what every indifferent person would rejoice to see\nexecuted.\nAnd hence it is, that to feel much for others and little for ourselves,\nthat to restrain our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections,\nconstitutes the perfection of human nature; and can alone produce among\nmankind that harmony of sentiments and passions in which consist their\nwhole grace and propriety. As to love our neighbour as we love ourselves\nis the great law of christianity, so it is the great precept of nature\nto love ourselves only as we love our neighbour, or what comes to the\nsame thing, as our neighbour is capable of loving us.\nAs taste and good judgment, when they are considered as qualities which\ndeserve praise and admiration, are supposed to imply a delicacy of\nsentiment and an acuteness of understanding not commonly to be met with;\nso the virtues of sensibility and self-command are not apprehended to\nconsist in the ordinary, but in the uncommon degrees of those qualities.\nThe amiable virtue of humanity requires, surely, a sensibility, much\nbeyond what is possessed by the rude vulgar of mankind. The great and\nexalted virtue of magnanimity undoubtedly demands much more than that\ndegree of self-command, which the weakest of mortals are capable of\nexerting. As in the common degree of the intellectual qualities, there\nare no abilities; so in the common degree of the moral, there is no\nvirtue. Virtue is excellence, something uncommonly great and beautiful,\nwhich rises far above what is vulgar and ordinary. The amiable virtues\nconsist in that degree of sensibility which surprises by its exquisite\nand unexpected delicacy and tenderness. The awful and respectable, in\nthat degree of self-command which astonishes by its amazing superiority\nover the most ungovernable passions of human nature.\nThere is, in this respect, a considerable difference between virtue and\nmere propriety; between those qualities and actions which deserve to be\nadmired and celebrated, and those which simply deserve to be approved\nof. Upon many occasions, to act with the most perfect propriety,\nrequires no more than that common and ordinary degree of sensibility or\nself-command which the most worthless of mankind are possessed of, and\nsometimes even that degree is not necessary. Thus, to give a very low\ninstance, to eat when we are hungry, is certainly, upon ordinary\noccasions, perfectly right and proper, and cannot miss being approved of\nas such by every body. Nothing, however, could be more absurd than to\nsay it is virtuous.\nOn the contrary, there may frequently be a considerable degree of virtue\nin those actions, which fall short of the most perfect propriety;\nbecause they may still approach nearer to perfection than could well be\nexpected upon occasions in which it was so extremely difficult to attain\nit: and this is very often the case upon those occasions which require\nthe greatest exertions of self-command. There are some situations which\nbear so hard upon human nature, that the greatest degree of\nself-government, which can belong to so imperfect a creature as man, is\nnot able to stifle, altogether, the voice of human weakness, or reduce\nthe violence of the passions to that pitch of moderation, in which the\nimpartial spectator can entirely enter into them. Though in those cases,\ntherefore, the behaviour of the sufferer fall short of the most perfect\npropriety, it may still deserve some applause, and even in a certain\nsense, may be denominated virtuous. It may still manifest an effort or\ngenerosity and magnanimity of which the greater part of men are\nincapable; and though it fails of absolute perfection, it may be a much\nnearer approximation towards perfection, than what, upon such trying\noccasions, is commonly either to be found or to be expected.\nIn cases of this kind, when we are determining the degree of blame or\napplause which seems due to any action, we very frequently make use of\ntwo different standards. The first is the idea of complete propriety and\nperfection, which, in those difficult situations, no human conduct ever\ndid, or even can come up to; and in comparison with which the actions of\nall men must for ever appear blameable and imperfect. The second is the\nidea of that degree of proximity or distance from this complete\nperfection, which the actions of the greater part of men commonly arrive\nat. Whatever goes beyond this degree, how far soever it may be removed\nfrom absolute perfection, seems to deserve applause; and whatever falls\nshort of it, to deserve blame.\nIt is in the same manner that we judge of the productions of all arts\nwhich address themselves to the imagination. When a critic examines the\nwork of any of the great masters for poetry or painting, he may\nsometimes examine it by an idea of perfection, in his own mind, which\nneither that nor any other human work will ever come up to; and as long\nas he compares it with this standard, he can see nothing in it but\nfaults and imperfections. But when he come to consider the rank which it\nought to hold among other works of the same kind, he necessarily\ncompares it with a very different standard, the common degree of\nexcellence which is usually attained in this particular art; and when he\njudges of it by this new measure, it may often appear to deserve the\nhighest applause, upon account of its approaching much nearer to\nperfection than the greater part of those works which can be brought\ninto competition with it.\nSECTION II.\nOf the degrees of the different passions which are consistent with\npropriety.\nINTRODUCTION.\nThe propriety of every passion excited by objects peculiarly related to\nourselves the pitch which the spectator can go along with, must lie, it\nis evident, in certain mediocrity. If the passion is too high, or if it\nis too low, he cannot enter into it. Grief and resentment for private\nmisfortunes and injuries may easily, for example, be too high, and in\nthe greater part of mankind they are so. They may likewise, though this\nmore rarely happens, be too low. We denominate the excess, weakness and\nfury: and we call the defect, stupidity, insensibility, and want of\nspirit. We can enter into neither of them, but are astonished and\nconfounded to see them.\nThis mediocrity, however, in which the point of propriety consists, is\ndifferent in different passions. It is high in some, and low in others.\nThere are some passions which it is indecent to express very strongly,\neven upon those occasions, in which it is acknowledged that we cannot\navoid feeling them in the highest degree. And there are others of which\nthe strongest expressions are upon many occasions extremely graceful,\neven though the passions themselves do not, perhaps, arise so\nnecessarily. The first are those passions with which, for certain\nreasons, there is little or no sympathy: the second are those with\nwhich, for other reasons, there is the greatest. And if we consider all\nthe different passions of human nature, we shall find that they are\nregarded as decent, or indecent, just in proportion as mankind are more\nor less disposed to sympathize with them.\nCHAP. I.\n_Of the passions which take their origin from the body._\n1. It is indecent to express any strong degree of those passions which\narise from a certain situation or disposition of the body; because the\ncompany, not being in the same disposition, cannot be expected to\nsympathize with them. Violent hunger, for example, though upon many\noccasions not only natural, but unavoidable, is always indecent, and to\neat voraciously is universally regarded as a piece of ill manners. There\nis, however, some degree of sympathy, even with hunger. It is agreeable\nto see our companions eat with a good appetite, and all expressions of\nloathing are offensive. The disposition of body which is habitual to a\nman in health, makes his stomach easily keep time, if I may be allowed\nso coarse an expression, with the one, and not with the other. We can\nsympathize with the distress which excessive hunger occasions when we\nread the description of it in the journal of a siege, or of a sea\nvoyage. We imagine ourselves in the situation of the sufferers, and\nthence readily conceive the grief, the fear and consternation, which\nmust necessarily distract them. We feel, ourselves, some degree of those\npassions, and therefore sympathize with them: but as we do not grow\nhungry by reading the description, we cannot properly, even in this\ncase, be said to sympathize with their hunger.\nIt is the same case with the passion by which Nature unites the two\nsexes. Though naturally the most furious of all passions, all strong\nexpressions of it are upon every occasion indecent, even between persons\nin whom its most complete indulgence is acknowledged by all laws, both\nhuman and divine, to be perfectly innocent. There seems, however, to be\nsome degree of sympathy even with this passion. To talk to a woman as we\nshould to a man is improper: it is expected that their company should\ninspire us with more gaiety, more pleasantry, and more attention; and an\nentire insensibility to the fair sex, renders a man contemptible in some\nmeasure even to the men.\nSuch is our aversion for all the appetites which take their origin from\nthe body: all strong expressions of them are loathsome and disagreeable.\nAccording to some ancient philosophers, these are the passions which we\nshare in common with the brutes, and which having no connexion with the\ncharacteristical qualities of human nature, are upon that account\nbeneath its dignity. But there are many other passions which we share in\ncommon with the brutes, such as resentment, natural affection, even\ngratitude, which do not, upon that account, appear to be so brutal. The\ntrue cause of the peculiar disgust which we conceive for the appetites\nof the body when we see them in other men, is that we cannot enter into\nthem. To the person himself who feels them, as soon as they are\ngratified, the object that excited them ceases to be agreeable: even its\npresence often becomes offensive to him; he looks round to no purpose\nfor the charm which transported him the moment before, and he can now as\nlittle enter into his own passion as another person. When we have dined,\nwe order the covers to be removed; and we should treat in the same\nmanner the objects of the most ardent and passionate desires, if they\nwere the objects of no other passions but those which take their origin\nfrom the body.\nIn the command of those appetites of the body consists that virtue which\nis properly called temperance. To restrain them within those bounds,\nwhich regard to health and fortune prescribes, is the part of prudence.\nBut to confine them within those limits, which grace, which propriety,\nwhich delicacy, and modesty, require, is the office of temperance.\n2. It is for the same reason that to cry out with bodily pain, how\nintolerable soever, appears always unmanly and unbecoming. There is,\nhowever, a good deal of sympathy even with bodily pain. If, as has\nalready been observed, I see a stroke aimed, and just ready to fall upon\nthe leg or arm, of another person, I naturally shrink and draw back my\nown leg, or my own arm; and when it does fall, I feel it in some\nmeasure, and am hurt by it as well as the sufferer. My hurt, however,\nis, no doubt, excessively slight, and, upon that account, if he makes\nany violent out-cry, as I cannot go along with him, I never fail to\ndespise him. And this is the case of all the passions which take their\norigin from the body: they excite either no sympathy at all, or such a\ndegree of it, as is altogether disproportioned to the violence of what\nis felt by the sufferer.\nIt is quite otherwise with those passions which take their origin from\nthe imagination. The frame of my body can be but little affected by the\nalterations which are brought about upon that of my companion: but my\nimagination is more ductile, and more readily assumes, if I may so, the\nshape and configuration of the imaginations of those with whom I am\nfamiliar. A disappointment in love, or ambition, will, upon this\naccount, call forth more sympathy than the greatest bodily evil. Those\npassions arise altogether from the imagination. The person who has lost\nhis whole fortune, if he is in health, feels nothing in his body. What\nhe suffers is from the imagination only, which represents to him the\nloss of his dignity, neglect from his friends, contempt from his\nenemies, dependence, want, and misery, coming fast upon him; and we\nsympathize with him more strongly upon this account, because our\nimaginations can more readily mould themselves upon his imagination,\nthan our bodies can mould themselves upon his body.\nThe loss of a leg may generally be regarded as a more real calamity than\nthe loss of a mistress. It would be a ridiculous tragedy, however, of\nwhich the catastrophe was to turn upon a loss of that kind. A misfortune\nof the other kind, how frivolous soever it may appear to be, has given\noccasion to many a fine one.\nNothing is so soon forgot as pain. The moment it is gone the whole agony\nof it is over, and the thought of it can no longer give us any sort of\ndisturbance. We ourselves cannot then enter into the anxiety and anguish\nwhich we had before conceived. An unguarded word from a friend will\noccasion a more durable uneasiness. The agony which this creates is by\nno means over with the word. What at first disturbs us is not the object\nof the senses, but the idea of the imagination. As it is an idea,\ntherefore, which occasions our uneasiness, till time and other accidents\nhave in some measure effaced it from our memory, the imagination\ncontinues to fret and rankle within, from the thought of it.\nPain never calls forth any very lively sympathy unless it is accompanied\nwith danger. We sympathize with the fear, though not with the agony of\nthe sufferer. Fear, however, is a passion derived altogether from the\nimagination, which represents, with an uncertainty and fluctuation that\nincreases our anxiety, not what we really feel, but what we may\nhereafter possibly suffer. The gout or the tooth-ache, though\nexquisitely painful, excite very little sympathy; more dangerous\ndiseases, though accompanied with very little pain, excite the highest.\nSome people faint and grow sick at the sight of a chirurgical operation,\nand that bodily pain which is occasioned by tearing the flesh, seems, in\nthem, to excite the most excessive sympathy. We conceive in a much more\nlively and distinct manner, the pain which proceeds from an external\ncause, than we do that which arises from an internal disorder. I can\nscarce form an idea of the agonies of my neighbour when he is tortured\nwith the gout, or the stone; but I have the clearest conception of what\nhe must suffer from an incision, a wound, or a fracture. The chief\ncause, however, why such objects produce such violent effects upon us,\nis their novelty. Once who has been witness to a dozen dissections, and\nas many amputations, sees, ever after, all operations of this kind with\ngreat indifference, and often with perfect insensibility. Though we have\nread or seen represented more than five hundred tragedies, we shall\nseldom feel so entire an abatement of our sensibility to the object\nwhich they represent to us.\nIn some of the Greek tragedies there is an attempt to excite compassion,\nby the representation of the agonies of bodily pain. Philoctetes cries\nout and faints from the extremity of his sufferings. Hippolytus and\nHercules are both introduced as expiring under the severest tortures,\nwhich, it seems, even the fortitude of Hercules was incapable of\nsupporting. In all these cases, however, it is not the pain which\ninterests us, but some other circumstance. It is not the sore foot, but\nthe solitude, of Philoctetes which affects us, and diffuses over that\ncharming tragedy, that romantic wildness, which is so agreeable to the\nimagination. The agonies of Hercules and Hippolytus are interested only\nbecause we foresee that death is to be the consequence. If those heroes\nwere to recover, we should think the representation of their sufferings\nperfectly ridiculous. What a tragedy would that be of which the distress\nconsisted in a colic. Yet no pain is more exquisite. These attempts to\nexcite compassion by the representation of bodily pain, may be regarded\nas among the greatest breaches of decorum of which the Greek theatre has\nset the example.\nThe little sympathy which we feel with bodily pain is the foundation of\nthe propriety of constancy and patience in enduring it. The man, who\nunder the severest tortures allows no weakness to escape him, vents no\ngroan, gives way to no passion which we do not entirely enter into,\ncommands our highest admiration. His firmness enables him to keep time\nwith our indifference and insensibility. We admire and entirely go along\nwith the magnanimous effort which he makes for this purpose. We approve\nof his behaviour, and from our experience of the common weakness of\nhuman nature, we are surprised, and wonder how he should be able to act\nso as to deserve approbation. Approbation, mixed and animated by wonder\nand surprise, constitutes the sentiment which is properly called\nadmiration, of which, applause is the natural expression, as has already\nbeen observed.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of those passions which take their origin from a particular turn or\nhabit of the imagination._\nEven of the passions derived from the imagination, those which take\ntheir origin from a peculiar turn or habit it has acquired, though they\nmay be acknowledged to be perfectly natural, are, however, but little\nsympathized with. The imaginations of mankind, not having acquired that\nparticular turn, cannot enter into them; and such passions, though they\nmay be allowed to be almost unavoidable in some part of life, are always\nin some measure ridiculous. This is the case with that strong attachment\nwhich naturally grows up between two persons of different sexes, who\nhave long fixed their thoughts upon one another. Our imagination not\nhaving run in the same channel with that of the lover, we cannot enter\ninto the eagerness of his emotions. If our friend has been injured, we\nreadily sympathize with his resentment, and grow angry with the very\nperson with whom he is angry. If he has received a benefit, we readily\nenter into his gratitude, and have a very high sense of the merit of his\nbenefactor. But if he is in love, though we may think his passion just\nas reasonable as any of the kind, yet we never think ourselves bound to\nconceive a passion of the same kind, and for the same person for whom he\nhas conceived it. The passion appears to every body, but the man who\nfeels it, entirely disproportioned to the value of the object; and love,\nthough it is pardoned in a certain age because we know it is natural, is\nalways laughed at, because we cannot enter into it. All serious and\nstrong expressions of it appear ridiculous to a third person; and though\na lover may be good company to his mistress, he is so to nobody else. He\nhimself is sensible of this; and as long as he continues in his sober\nsenses, endeavours to treat his own passion with raillery and ridicule.\nIt is the only style in which we care to hear of it; because it is the\nonly style in which we ourselves are disposed to talk of it. We grow\nweary of the grave, pedantic, and long-sentenced love of Cowley and\nPropertius, who never have done with exaggerating the violence of their\nattachments; but the gaiety of Ovid, and the gallantry of Horace, are\nalways agreeable.\nBut though we feel no proper sympathy with an attachment of this kind,\nthough we never approach even in imagination towards conceiving a\npassion for that particular person, yet as we either have conceived, or\nmay be disposed to conceive, passions of the same kind, we readily enter\ninto those high hopes of happiness which are proposed from its\ngratification, as well as into that exquisite distress which is feared\nfrom its disappointment. It interests us not as a passion, but as a\nsituation that gives occasion to other passions which interest us; to\nhope, to fear, and to distress of every kind: in the same manner as in a\ndescription of a sea voyage, it is not the hunger which interests us,\nbut the distress which that hunger occasions. Though we do not properly\nenter into the attachment of the lover, we readily go along with those\nexpectations of romantic happiness which he derives from it. We feel how\nnatural it is for the mind, in a certain situation, relaxed with\nindolence, and fatigued with the violence of desire, to long for\nserenity and quiet, to hope to find them in the gratification of that\npassion which distracts it, and to frame to itself the idea of that life\nof pastoral tranquillity and retirement which the elegant, the tender,\nand the passionate Tibullus takes so much pleasure in deferring; a life\nlike what the poets describe in the Fortunate Islands, a life of\nfriendship, liberty, and repose; free from labour, and from care, and\nfrom all the turbulent passions which attend them. Even scenes of this\nkind interest us most, when they are painted rather as what is hoped,\nthan as what is enjoyed. The grossness of that passion which mixes with,\nand is, perhaps, the foundation of love, disappears when its\ngratification is far off and at a distance; but renders the whole\noffensive, when described as what is immediately possessed. The happy\npassion, upon this account, interests us much less than the fearful and\nthe melancholy. We tremble for whatever can disappoint such natural and\nagreeable hopes: and thus enter into all the anxiety, and concern, and\ndistress of the lover.\nHence it is, that, in some modern tragedies and romances, this passion\nappears so wonderfully interesting. It is not so much the love of\nCastalio and Monimia which attaches us in the Orphan, as the distress\nwhich that love occasions. The author who should introduce two lovers,\nin a scene of perfect security, expressing their mutual fondness for one\nanother, would excite laughter, and not sympathy. If a scene of this\nkind is ever admitted into a tragedy, it is always, in some measure,\nimproper, and is endured, not from any sympathy with the passion that is\nexpressed in it, but from concern for the dangers and difficulties with\nwhich the audience foresee that its gratification is likely to be\nattended.\nThe reserve which the laws of society impose upon the fair sex, with\nregard to this weakness, renders it more peculiarly distressful in them,\nand, upon that very account, more deeply interesting. We are charmed\nwith the love of Ph\u00e6dra, as it is expressed in the French tragedy of\nthat name, notwithstanding all the extravagance and guilt which attends\nit. That very extravagance and guilt may be said, in some measure, to\nrecommend it to us. Her fear, her shame, her remorse, her horror, her\ndespair, become thereby more natural and interesting. All the secondary\npassions, if I may be allowed to call them so, which arise from the\nsituation of love, become necessarily more furious and violent: and it\nis with these secondary passions only that we can properly be said to\nsympathize.\nOf all the passions, however, which are so extravagantly disproportioned\nto the value of their objects, love is the only one that appears, even\nto the weakest minds, to have any thing in it that is either graceful or\nagreeable. In itself, first of all, though it may be ridiculous, it is\nnot naturally odious; and though its consequences are often fatal and\ndreadful, its intentions are seldom mischievous. And then, though there\nis little propriety in the passion itself, there is a good deal in some\nof those which always accompany it. There is in love a strong mixture of\nhumanity, generality, kindness, friendship, esteem; passions with which,\nof all others, for reasons which shall be explained immediately, we have\nthe greatest propensity to sympathize, even notwithstanding we are\nsensible that they are, in some measure, excessive. The sympathy which\nwe feel with them, renders the passion which they accompany less\ndisagreeable, and supports it in our imagination, notwithstanding all\nthe vices which commonly go along with it; though in the one sex it\nnecessarily leads to ruin and infamy; and though in the other, where it\nis apprehended to be least fatal, it is almost always attended with an\nincapacity for labour, a neglect of duty, a contempt of fame, and even\nof common reputation. Notwithstanding all this, the degree of\nsensibility and generosity with which it is supposed to be accompanied,\nrenders it to many the object of vanity; and they are fond of appearing\ncapable of feeling what would do them no honour if they had really felt\nit.\nIt is for a reason of the same kind, that a certain reserve is necessary\nwhen we talk of our own friends, our own studies, our own professions.\nAll these are objects which we cannot expect should interest our\ncompanions in the same degree in which they interest us. And it is for\nwant of this reserve, that the one half of mankind make bad company to\nthe other. A philosopher is company to a philosopher only; the member of\na club, to his own little knot of companions.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of the unsocial passions._\nThere is another set of passions, which though derived from the\nimagination, yet before we can enter into them, or regard them as\ngraceful or becoming, must always be brought down to a pitch much lower\nthan that to which undisciplined nature would raise them. These are\nhatred and resentment, with all their different modifications. With\nregard to all such passions, our sympathy is divided between the person\nwho feels them and the person who is the object of them. The interests\nof these two are directly opposite. What our sympathy with the person\nwho feels them would prompt us to wish for, our fellow-feeling with the\nother would lead us to fear. As they are both men, we are concerned for\nboth, and our fear for what the one may suffer, damps our resentment for\nwhat the other has suffered. Our sympathy, therefore, with the man who\nhas received the provocation, necessarily falls short of the passion\nwhich naturally animates him, not only upon account of those general\ncauses which render all sympathetic passions inferior to the original\nones, but upon account of that particular cause which is peculiar to\nitself, our opposite sympathy with another person. Before resentment,\ntherefore, can become graceful and agreeable, it must be more humbled\nand brought down below that pitch to which it would naturally rise, than\nalmost any other passion.\nMankind, at the same time, have a very strong sense of the injuries that\nare done to another. The villain, in a tragedy or romance, is as much\nthe object of our indignation, as the hero is that of our sympathy and\naffection. We detest Iago as much as we esteem Othello; and delight as\nmuch in the punishment of the one, as we are grieved at the distress of\nthe other. But though mankind have so strong a fellow-feeling with the\ninjuries that are done to their brethren, they do not always resent them\nthe more that the sufferer appears to resent them. Upon most occasions,\nthe greater his patience, his mildness, his humanity, provided it does\nnot appear that he wants spirit, or that fear was the motive of his\nforbearance, the higher the resentment against the person who injured\nhim. The amiableness of the character exasperates their sense of the\natrocity of the injury.\nThese passions, however, are regarded as necessary parts of the\ncharacter of human nature. A person becomes contemptible who tamely sits\nstill, and submits to insults, without attempting either to repel or to\nrevenge them. We cannot enter into his indifference and insensibility:\nwe call his behaviour mean-spiritedness, and are as really provoked by\nit as by the insolence of his adversary. Even the mob are enraged to see\nany man submit patiently to affronts and ill usage. They desire to see\nthis insolence resented, and resented by the person who suffers from it.\nThey cry to him with fury, to defend, or to revenge himself. If his\nindignation rouses at last, they heartily applaud, and sympathize with\nit. It enlivens their own indignation against his enemy, whom they\nrejoice to see him attack in turn, and are as really gratified by his\nrevenge, provided it is not immoderate, as if the injury had been done\nto themselves.\nBut though the utility of those passions to the individual, by rendering\nit dangerous to insult or injure him, be acknowledged; and though their\nutility to the public, as the guardians of justice, and of the equality\nof its administration, be not less considerable, as shall be shewn\nhereafter; yet there is still something disagreeable in the passions\nthemselves, which makes the appearance of them in other men the natural\nobject of our aversion. The expression of anger towards any body\npresent, if it exceeds a bare intimation that we are sensible of his ill\nusage, is regarded not only as an insult to that particular person, but\nas a rudeness to the whole company. Respect for them ought to have\nrestrained us from giving way to so boisterous and offensive an emotion.\nIt is the remote effects of these passions which are agreeable; the\nimmediate effects are mischief to the person against whom they are\ndirected. But it is the immediate, and not the remote effects of objects\nwhich render them agreeable or disagreeable to the imagination. A prison\nis certainly more useful to the public than a palace; and the person who\nfounds the one is generally directed by a much juster spirit of\npatriotism, than he who builds the other. But the immediate effects of a\nprison, the confinement of the wretches shut up in it, are disagreeable;\nand the imagination either does not take time to trace out the remote\nones, or sees them at too great a distance to be much affected by them.\nA prison, therefore, will always be a disagreeable object; and the\nfitter it is for the purpose for which it was intended, it will be the\nmore so. A palace, on the contrary, will always be agreeable; yet its\nremote effects may often be inconvenient to the public. It may serve to\npromote luxury, and set the example of the dissolution of manners. Its\nimmediate effects, however, the conveniency, the pleasure, and the\ngaiety of the people who live in it, being all agreeable, and suggesting\nto the imagination a thousand agreeable ideas, that faculty generally\nrests upon them, and seldom goes further in tracing its more distant\nconsequences. Trophies of the instruments of music or of agriculture,\nimitated in painting or in stucco, make a common and an agreeable\nornament of our halls and dining-rooms. A trophy of the same kind,\ncomposed of the instruments of surgery, of dissecting and\namputation-knives, of saws for cutting the bones, of trepanning\ninstruments, &c. would be absurd and shocking. Instruments of surgery,\nhowever, are always more finely polished, and generally more nicely\nadapted to the purposes for which they are intended, than instruments of\nagriculture. The remote effects of them too, the health of the patient,\nis agreeable, yet as the immediate effect of them is pain and suffering,\nthe sight of them always displeases us. Instruments of war are\nagreeable, though their immediate effect may seem to be in the same\nmanner pain and suffering. But then it is the pain and suffering of our\nenemies, with whom we have no sympathy. With regard to us, they are\nimmediately connected with the agreeable ideas of courage, victory, and\nhonour. They are themselves, therefore, supposed to make one of the\nnoblest parts of dress, and the imitation of them one of the finest\nornaments of architecture. It is the same case with the qualities of the\nmind. The ancient stoics were of opinion, that as the world was governed\nby the all-ruling providence of a wise, powerful, and good God, every\nsingle event ought to be regarded, as making a necessary part of the\nplan of the universe, and as tending to promote the general order and\nhappiness of the whole: that the vices and follies of mankind,\ntherefore, made as necessary a part of this plan as their wisdom or\ntheir virtue; and by that eternal art which educes good from ill, were\nmade to tend equally to the prosperity and perfection of the great\nsystem of nature. No speculation of this kind, however, how deeply\nsoever it might be rooted in the mind, could diminish our natural\nabhorrence for vice, whose immediate effects are so destructive, and\nwhose remote ones are too distant to be traced by the imagination.\nIt is the same case with those passions we have been just now\nconsidering. Their immediate effects are so disagreeable, that even when\nthey are most justly provoked, there is still something about them which\ndisgusts us. These, therefore, are the only passions of which the\nexpressions, as I formerly observed, do not dispose and prepare us to\nsympathize with them, before we are informed of the cause which excites\nthem. The plaintive voice of misery, when heard at a distance, will not\nallow us to be indifferent about the person from whom it comes. As soon\nas it strikes our ear, it interests us in his fortune, and, if\ncontinued, forces us almost involuntarily to fly to his assistance. The\nsight of a smiling countenance, in the same manner, elevates even the\npensive into that gay and airy mood, which disposes him to sympathize\nwith, and share the joy which it expresses; and he feels his heart,\nwhich with thought and care was before that shrunk and depressed,\ninstantly expanded and elated. But it is quite otherwise with the\nexpressions of hatred and resentment. The hoarse, boisterous, and\ndiscordant voice of anger, when heard at a distance, inspires us either\nwith fear or aversion. We do not fly towards it, as to one who cries out\nwith pain and agony. Women, and men of weak nerves, tremble and are\novercome with fear, though sensible that themselves are not the objects\nof the anger. They conceive fear, however, by putting themselves in the\nsituation of the person who is so. Even those of stouter hearts are\ndisturbed; not indeed enough to make them afraid, but enough to make\nthem angry; for anger is the passion which they would feel in the\nsituation of the other person. It is the same case with hatred. Mere\nexpressions of spite inspire it against no body, but the man who uses\nthem. Both these passions are by nature the objects of our aversion.\nTheir disagreeable and boisterous appearance never excites, never\nprepares, and often disturbs our sympathy. Grief does not more\npowerfully engage and attract us to the person in whom we observe it,\nthan these, while we are ignorant of their cause, disgust and detach us\nfrom him. It was, it seems, the intention of Nature, that those rougher\nand more unamiable emotions, which drive men from one another, should be\nless easily and more rarely communicated.\nWhen music imitates the modulations of grief or joy, it either actually\ninspires us with those passions, or at least puts us in the mood which\ndisposes us to conceive them. But when it imitates the notes of anger,\nit inspires us with fear. Joy, grief, love, admiration, devotion, are\nall of them passions which are naturally musical. Their natural tones\nare all soft, clear, and melodious; and they naturally express\nthemselves in periods which are distinguished by regular pauses, and\nwhich upon that account are easily adapted to the regular returns of the\ncorrespondent airs of a tune. The voice of anger, on the contrary, and\nof all the passions which are akin to it, is harsh and discordant. It\nperiods too are all irregular, sometimes very long, and sometimes very\nshort, and distinguished by no regular pauses. It is with difficulty,\ntherefore, that music can imitate any of those passions; and the music\nwhich does imitate them is not the most agreeable. A whole entertainment\nmay consist, without any impropriety, of the imitation of the social and\nagreeable passions. It would be a strange entertainment which consisted\naltogether of the imitations of hatred and resentment.\nIf those passions are disagreeable to the spectator, they are not less\nso to the person who feels them. Hatred and anger are the greatest\npoison to the happiness of a good mind. There is, in the very feeling of\nthose passions, something harsh, jarring, and convulsive, something that\ntears and distracts the breast, and is altogether destructive of that\ncomposure and tranquillity of mind which is so necessary to happiness,\nand which is best promoted by the contrary passions of gratitude and\nlove. It is not the value of what they lose by the perfidy and\ningratitude of those they live with, which the generous and humane are\nmost apt to regret. Whatever they may have lost, they can generally be\nvery happy without it. What most disturbs them is the idea of perfidy\nand ingratitude exercised towards themselves; and the discordant and\ndisagreeable passions which this excites, constitutes, in their own\nopinion, the chief part of the injury which they suffer.\nHow many things are requisite to render the gratification of resentment\ncompleatly agreeable, and to make the spectator thoroughly sympathize\nwith our revenge? The provocation must first of all be such that we\nshould become contemptible, and be exposed to perpetual insults, if we\ndid not, in some measure, resent it. Smaller offences are always better\nneglected; nor is there any thing more despicable than that froward and\ncaptious humour which takes fire upon every slight occasion of quarrel.\nWe should resent more from a sense of the propriety of resentment, from\na sense that mankind expect and require it of us, than because we feel\nin ourselves the furies of that disagreeable passion. There is no\npassion, of which the human mind is capable, concerning whose justness\nwe ought to be so doubtful, concerning whose indulgence we ought so\ncarefully to consult our natural sense of propriety, or so diligently to\nconsider what will be the sentiments of the impartial spectator.\nMagnanimity, or a regard to maintain our own rank and dignity in\nsociety, is the only motive which can ennoble the expressions of this\ndisagreeable passion. This motive must characterize our whole stile and\ndeportment. These must be plain, open, and direct; determined without\npositiveness, and elevated without insolence; not only free from\npetulance and low scurrility, but generous, candid, and full of all\nproper regards, even for the person who has offended us. It must appear,\nin short, from our whole manner, without our labouring affectedly to\nexpress it, that passion has not extinguished our humanity; and that if\nwe yield to the dictates of revenge, it is with reluctance, from\nnecessity, and in consequence of great and repeated provocations. When\nresentment is guarded and qualified in this manner, it may be admitted\nto be even generous and noble.\nCHAP. IV.\n_Of the social passions._\nAs it is a divided sympathy which renders the whole set of passions just\nnow mentioned, upon most occasions, so ungraceful and disagreeable; so\nthere is another set opposite to these, which a redoubled sympathy\nrenders almost always peculiarly agreeable and becoming. Generosity,\nhumanity, kindness, compassion, mutual friendship and esteem, all the\nsocial and benevolent affections, when expressed in the countenance or\nbehaviour, even towards those who are peculiarly connected with\nourselves, please the indifferent spectator upon almost every occasion.\nHis sympathy with the person who feels those passions, exactly coincides\nwith his concern for the person who is the object of them. The interest,\nwhich, as a man, he is obliged to take in the happiness of this last,\nenlivens his fellow-feeling with the sentiments of the other, whose\nemotions are employed about the same object. We have always, therefore,\nthe strongest disposition to sympathize with the benevolent affections.\nThey appear in every respect agreeable to us. We enter into the\nsatisfaction both of the person who feels them, and of the person who is\nthe object of them. For as to be the object of hatred and indignation\ngives more pain than all the evils which a brave man can fear from his\nenemies; so there is a satisfaction in the consciousness of being\nbeloved, which, to a person of delicacy and sensibility, is of more\nimportance to happiness than all the advantage which he can expect to\nderive from it. What character is so detectable as that of one who takes\npleasure to sow dissension among friends, and to turn their most tender\nlove into mortal hatred? Yet wherein does the atrocity of this so much\nabhorred injury consist? Is it in depriving them of the frivolous good\noffices, which had their friendship continued, they might have expected\nfrom one another? It is in depriving them of that friendship itself, in\nrobbing them of each others affections, from which both derived so much\nsatisfaction; it is in disturbing the harmony of their hearts, and\nputting an end to that happy commerce which had before subsisted between\nthem. These affections, that harmony, this commerce, are felt, not only\nby the tender and the delicate, but by the rudest vulgar of mankind, to\nbe of more importance to happiness than all the little services which\ncould be expected to flow from them.\nThe sentiment of love is, in itself, agreeable to the person who feels\nit. It sooths and composes the breast, seems to favour the vital\nmotions, and to promote the healthful state of the human constitution;\nand it is rendered still more delightful by the consciousness of the\ngratitude and satisfaction which it must excite in him who is the object\nof it. Their mutual regard renders them happy in one another, and\nsympathy, with this mutual regard, makes them agreeable to every other\nperson. With what pleasure do we look upon a family, through the whole\nof which reign mutual love and esteem, where the parents and children\nare companions for one another, without any other difference than what\nis made by respectful affection on the one side, and kind indulgence on\nthe other; where freedom and fondness, mutual raillery, and mutual\nkindness, show that no opposition of interest divides the brothers, nor\nany rivalship of favour sets the sisters at variance, and where every\nthing presents us with the idea of peace, chearfulness, harmony, and\ncontentment? On the contrary, how uneasy are we made when we go into a\nhouse in which jarring contention sets one half of those who dwell in it\nagainst the other; where amidst affected smoothness and complaisance,\nsuspicious looks and sudden starts of passion betray the mutual\njealousies which burn within them, and which are every moment ready to\nburst out through all the restraints which the presence of the company\nimposes?\nThose amiable passions, even when they are acknowledged to be excessive,\nare never regarded with aversion. There is something agreeable even in\nthe weakness of friendship and humanity. The too tender mother, the too\nindulgent father, the too generous and affectionate friend, may\nsometimes, perhaps, on account of the softness of their natures, be\nlooked upon with a species of pity, in which, however, there is a\nmixture of love, but can never be regarded with hatred and aversion, nor\neven with contempt, unless by the most brutal and worthless of mankind:\nIt is always with concern, with sympathy and kindness, that we blame\nthem for the extravagance of their attachment. There is a helplessness\nin the character of extreme humanity which more than any thing interests\nour pity. There is nothing in itself which renders it either ungraceful\nor disagreeable. We only regret that it is unfit for the world, because\nthe world is unworthy of it, and because it must expose the person who\nis endowed with it as a prey to the perfidy and ingratitude of\ninsinuating falsehood, and to a thousand pains and uneasinesses, which,\nof all men, he the least deserves to feel, and which generally too he\nis, of all men, the least capable of supporting. It is quite otherwise\nwith hatred and resentment. Too violent a propensity to those detestable\npassions, renders a person the object of universal dread and abhorrence,\nwho, like a wild beast, ought, we think, to be hunted out of all civil\nsociety.\nCHAP. V.\n_Of the selfish passions._\nBesides those two opposite sets of passions, the social and unsocial,\nthere is another which holds a sort of middle place between them; is\nnever either so graceful as is sometimes the one set, nor is ever so\nodious as is sometimes the other. Grief and joy, when conceived upon\naccount of our own private good or bad fortune, constitute this third\nset of passions. Even when excessive, they are never so disagreeable as\nexcessive resentment, because no opposite sympathy can ever interest us\nagainst them: and when most suitable to their objects they are never so\nagreeable as impartial humanity and just benevolence; because no double\nsympathy can ever interest us for them. There is, however, this\ndifference between grief and joy, that we are generally most disposed to\nsympathize with small joys and great sorrows. The man, who, by some\nsudden revolution of fortune, is lifted up all at once into a condition\nof life, greatly above what he had formerly lived in, may be assured\nthat the congratulations of his best friends are not all of them\nperfectly sincere. An upstart, though of the greatest merit, is\ngenerally disagreeable, and a sentiment of envy commonly prevents us\nfrom heartily sympathizing with his joy. If he has any judgment he is\nsensible of this, and instead of appearing to be elated with his good\nfortune, he endeavours, as much as he can, to smother his joy, and keep\ndown that elevation of mind with which his new circumstances naturally\ninspire him. He affects the same plainness of dress, and the same\nmodesty of behaviour, which became him in his former station. He\nredoubles his attention to his old friends, and endeavours more than\never to be humble, assiduous, and complaisant. And this is the behaviour\nwhich in his situation we most approve of; because we expect, it seems,\nthat he should have more sympathy with our envy and aversion to his\nhappiness, than we have with his happiness. It is seldom that with all\nthis he succeeds. We suspect the sincerity of his humility, and he grows\nweary of this constraint. In a little time, therefore, he generally\nleaves all his old friends behind him, some of the meanest of them\nexcepted, who may, perhaps, condescend to become his dependents: nor\ndoes he always acquire any new ones; the pride of his new connections is\nas much affronted at finding him their equal, as that of his old ones\nhad been by his becoming their superior: and it requires the most\nobstinate and persevering modesty to atone for this mortification to\neither. He generally grows weary too soon, and is provoked, by the\nsullen and suspicious pride of the one, and by the saucy contempt of the\nother, to treat the first with neglect, and the second with petulance,\ntill at last he grows habitually insolent, and forfeits the esteem of\nall. If the chief part of human happiness arises from the consciousness\nof being beloved, as I believe it does, those sudden changes of fortune\nseldom contribute much to happiness. He is happiest who advances more\ngradually to greatness, whom the public destines to every step of his\npreferment long before he arrives at it, in whom, upon that account,\nwhen it comes, it can excite no extravagant joy, and with regard to whom\nit cannot reasonably create either any jealousy in those he overtakes,\nor any envy in those he leaves behind.\nMankind, however, more readily sympathize with those smaller joys which\nflow from less important causes. It is decent to be humble amidst great\nprosperity; but we can scarce express too much satisfaction in all the\nlittle occurrences of common life, in the company with which we spent\nthe evening last night, in the entertainment that was set before us, in\nwhat was said and what was done, in all the little incidents of the\npresent conversation, and in all those frivolous nothings which fill up\nthe void of human life. Nothing is more graceful than habitual\nchearfulness, which is always founded upon a peculiar relish for all the\nlittle pleasures which common occurrences afford. We readily sympathize\nwith it: it inspires us with the same joy, and makes every trifle turn\nup to us in the same agreeable aspect in which it presents itself to the\nperson endowed with this happy disposition. Hence it is that youth, the\nseason of gaiety, so easily engages our affections. That propensity to\njoy which seems even to animate the bloom, and to sparkle from the eyes\nof youth and beauty, though in a person of the same sex, exalts, even\nthe aged, to a more joyous mood than ordinary. They forget, for a time,\ntheir infirmities, and abandon themselves to those agreeable ideas and\nemotions to which they have long been strangers, but which, when the\npresence of so much happiness recalls them to their breast, take their\nplace there, like old acquaintance, from whom they are sorry to have\never been parted, and whom they embrace more heartily upon account of\nthis long separation.\nIt is quite otherwise with grief. Small vexations excite no sympathy,\nbut deep affliction calls forth the greatest. The man who is made uneasy\nby every little disagreeable incident, who is hurt if either the cook or\nthe butler have failed in the least article of their duty, who feels\nevery defect in the highest ceremonial of politeness, whether it be\nshewn to himself or to any other person, who takes it amiss that his\nintimate friend did not bid him good-morrow when they met in the\nforenoon, and that his brother hummed a tune all the time he himself was\ntelling a story; who is put out of humour by the badness of the weather\nwhen in the country, by the badness of the roads when upon a journey,\nand by the want of company, and dullness of all public diversions when\nin town; such a person, I say, though he should have some reason, will\nseldom meet with much sympathy. Joy is a pleasant emotion, and we gladly\nabandon ourselves to it upon the slightest occasion. We readily,\ntherefore, sympathize with it in others, whenever we are not prejudiced\nby envy. But grief is painful, and the mind, even when it is our own\nmisfortune, naturally resists and recoils from it. We would endeavour\neither not to conceive it at all, or to shake it off as soon as we have\nconceived it. Our aversion to grief will not, indeed, always hinder us\nfrom conceiving it in our own case upon very trifling occasions, but it\nconstantly prevents us from sympathizing with it in others when excited\nby the like frivolous causes: for our sympathetic passions are always\nless irresistible than our original ones. There is, besides, a malice in\nmankind, which not only prevents all sympathy with little uneasinesses,\nbut renders them in some measure diverting. Hence the delight which we\nall take in raillery, and in the small vexation which we observe in our\ncompanion, when he is pushed, and urged, and teased upon all sides. Men\nof the most ordinary good-breeding dissemble the pain which any little\nincident may give them; and those who are more thoroughly formed to\nsociety, turn, of their own accord, all such incidents into raillery, as\nthey know their companions will do for them. The habit which a man, who\nlives in the world, has acquired of considering how every thing that\nconcerns himself will appear to others, makes those frivolous calamities\nturn up in the same ridiculous light to him, in which he knows they will\ncertainly be considered by them.\nOur sympathy, on the contrary, with deep distress, is very strong and\nvery sincere. It is unnecessary to give an instance. We weep even at the\nfeigned representation of a tragedy. If you labour, therefore, under any\nsignal calamity, if by some extraordinary misfortune you are fallen into\npoverty, into diseases, into disgrace and disappointment; even though\nyour own fault may have been, in part, the occasion, yet you may\ngenerally depend upon the sincerest sympathy of all your friends, and,\nas far as interest and honour will permit, upon their kindest assistance\ntoo. But if your misfortune is not of this dreadful kind, if you have\nonly been a little baulked in your ambition, if you have only been\njilted by your mistress, or are only hen-pecked by your wife, lay your\naccount with the raillery of all your acquaintance.\nSECTION III.\nOf the effects of prosperity and adversity upon the judgment of mankind\nwith regard to the propriety of action; and why it is more easy to\nobtain their approbation in the one state than in the other.\nCHAP. I.\n_That though our sympathy with sorrow is generally a more lively\nsensation than our sympathy with joy, it commonly falls much more short\nof the violence of what is naturally felt by the person principally\nconcerned._\nOur sympathy with sorrow, though not more real, has been more taken\nnotice of than our sympathy with joy. The word sympathy, in its most\nproper and primitive signification, denotes our fellow-feeling with the\nsufferings, not that with the enjoyments, of others. A late ingenious\nand subtile philosopher thought it necessary to prove, by arguments,\nthat we had a real sympathy with joy, and that congratulation was a\nprinciple of human nature. Nobody, I believe, ever thought it necessary\nto prove that compassion was such.\nFirst of all, our sympathy with sorrow is, in some sense, more universal\nthan that with joy. Though sorrow is excessive, we may still have some\nfellow-feeling with it. What we feel does not, indeed, in this case,\namount to that complete sympathy, to that perfect harmony and\ncorrespondence of sentiments which constitutes approbation. We do not\nweep, and exclaim, and lament, with the sufferer. We are sensible, on\nthe contrary, of his weakness, and of the extravagance of his passion,\nand yet often feel a very sensible concern upon his account. But if we\ndo not entirely enter into, and go along with, the joy of another, we\nhave no sort of regard or fellow-feeling for it. The man who skips and\ndances about with that intemperate and senseless joy which we cannot\naccompany him in, is the object of our contempt and indignation.\nPain besides, whether of mind or body, is a more pungent sensation than\npleasure, and our sympathy with pain, though it falls greatly short of\nwhat is naturally felt by the sufferer, is generally a more lively and\ndistinct perception than our sympathy with pleasure, though this last\noften approaches more nearly, as I shall show immediately, to the\nnatural vivacity of the original passion.\nOver and above all this, we often struggle to keep down our sympathy\nwith the sorrow of others. Whenever we are not under the observation of\nthe sufferer, we endeavour, for our own sake, to suppress it as much as\nwe can, and we are not always successful. The opposition which we make\nto it, and the reluctance with which we yield to it, necessarily oblige\nus to take more particular notice of it. But we never have occasion to\nmake this opposition to our sympathy with joy. If there is any envy in\nthe case, we never feel the least propensity towards it; and if there is\nnone, we give way to it without any reluctance. On the contrary, as we\nare always ashamed of our own envy, we often pretend, and sometimes\nreally wish to sympathize with the joy of others, when by that\ndisagreeable sentiment we are disqualified from doing so. We are glad,\nwe say, on account of our neighbour\u2019s good fortune, when in our hearts,\nperhaps, we are really sorry. We often feel a sympathy with sorrow when\nwe wish to be rid of it; and we often miss that with joy when we would\nbe glad to have it. The obvious observation, therefore, which it\nnaturally falls in our way to make, is that our propensity to sympathize\nwith sorrow must be very strong, and our inclination to sympathize with\njoy very weak.\nNotwithstanding this prejudice, however, I will venture to affirm, that,\nwhen there is no envy in the case, our propensity to sympathize with joy\nis much stronger than our propensity to sympathize with sorrow; and that\nour fellow-feeling for the agreeable emotion approaches much more nearly\nto the vivacity of what is naturally felt by the persons principally\nconcerned, than that which we conceive for the painful one.\nWe have some indulgence for that excessive grief which we cannot\nentirely go along with. We know what a prodigious effort is requisite\nbefore the sufferer can bring down his emotions to compleat harmony and\nconcord with those of the spectator. Though he fails, therefore, we\neasily pardon him. But we have no such indulgence for the intemperance\nof joy; because we are not conscious that any such vast effort is\nrequisite to bring it down to what we can entirely enter into. The man\nwho, under the greatest calamities, can command his sorrow, seems worthy\nof the highest admiration; but he who, in the fulness of prosperity, can\nin the same manner master his joy, seems hardly to deserve any praise.\nWe are sensible that there is a much wider interval in the one case than\nin the other, between what is naturally felt by the person principally\nconcerned, and what the spectator can entirely go along with.\nWhat can be added to the happiness of the man who is in health, who is\nout of debt, and has a clear conscience? To one in this situation, all\naccessions of fortune may properly be said to be superfluous; and if he\nis much elevated upon account of them, it must be the effect of the most\nfrivolous levity. This situation, however, may very well be called the\nnatural and ordinary state of mankind. Notwithstanding the present\nmisery and depravity of the world, so justly lamented, this really is\nthe state of the greater part of men. The greater part of men,\ntherefore, cannot find any great difficulty in elevating themselves to\nall the joy which any accession to this situation can well excite in\ntheir companion.\nBut though little can be added to this state, much may be taken from it.\nThough between this condition and the highest pitch of human prosperity,\nthe interval is but a trifle; between it and the lowest depth of misery\nthe distance is immense and prodigious. Adversity, on this account,\nnecessarily depresses the mind of the sufferer much more below its\nnatural state, than prosperity can elevate him above it. The spectator,\ntherefore, must find it much more difficult to sympathize entirely, and\nkeep perfect time, with his sorrow, than thoroughly to enter into his\njoy, and must depart much further from his own natural and ordinary\ntemper of mind in the one case than in the other. It is on this account,\nthat, though our sympathy with sorrow is often a more pungent sensation\nthan our sympathy with joy, it always falls much more short of the\nviolence of what is naturally felt by the person principally concerned.\nIt is agreeable to sympathize with joy; and wherever envy does not\noppose it, our heart abandons itself with satisfaction to the highest\ntransports of that delightful sentiment. But it is painful to go along\nwith grief, and we always enter into it with reluctance[1]. When we\nattend to the representation of a tragedy, we struggle against that\nsympathetic sorrow which the entertainment inspires as long as we can,\nand we give way to it at last only when we can no longer avoid it: we\neven then endeavour to cover our concern from the company. If we shed\nany tears, we carefully conceal them, and are afraid lest the\nspectators, not entering into this excessive tenderness, should regard\nit as effeminacy and weakness. The wretch whose misfortunes call upon\nour compassion feels with what reluctance we are likely to enter into\nhis sorrow, and therefore proposes his grief to us with fear and\nhesitation: he even smothers the half of it, and is ashamed, upon\naccount of this hard-heartedness of mankind, to give vent to the fulness\nof his affliction. It is otherwise with the man who riots in joy and\nsuccess. Wherever envy does not interest us against him, he expects our\ncompleatest sympathy. He does not fear, therefore, to announce himself\nwith shouts of exultation, in full confidence that we are heartily\ndisposed to go along with him.\nFootnote 1:\nIt has been objected to me that as I found the sentiment of\napprobation, which is always agreeable, upon sympathy, it is\ninconsistent with my system to admit any disagreeable sympathy. I\nanswer, that in the sentiment of approbation there are two things to\nbe taken notice of; first the sympathetic passion of the spectator;\nand, secondly, the emotion which arises from his observing the perfect\ncoincidence between this sympathetic passion in himself, and the\noriginal passion in the person principally concerned. This last\nemotion, in which the sentiment of approbation properly consists, is\nalways agreeable and delightful. The other may either be agreeable or\ndisagreeable, according to the nature of the original passion, whose\nfeature it must always, in some measure, retain. Two sounds I suppose,\nmay, each of them, taken singly, be austere, and yet, if they are\nperfect concords, the perception of their harmony and coincidence may\nbe agreeable.\nWhy should we be more ashamed to weep than to laugh before company? We\nmay often have as real occasion to do the one as to do the other: But we\nalways feel that the spectators are more likely to go along with us in\nthe agreeable, than in the painful emotion. It is always miserable to\ncomplain, even when we are oppressed by the most dreadful calamities.\nBut the triumph of victory is not always ungraceful. Prudence, indeed,\nwould often advise us to bear prosperity with more moderation; because\nprudence would teach us to avoid that envy which this very triumph is,\nmore than any thing, apt to excite.\nHow hearty are the acclamations of the mob, who never bear any envy to\ntheir superiors, at a triumph or a public entry? And how sedate and\nmoderate is commonly their grief at an execution? Our sorrow at a\nfuneral generally amounts to no more than affected gravity; but our\nmirth at a christening or a marriage, is always from the heart, and\nwithout any affectation. Upon these, and all such joyous occasions, our\nsatisfaction, though not so durable, is often as lively as that of the\npersons principally concerned. Whenever we cordially congratulate our\nfriends, which, however, to the disgrace of human nature, we do but\nseldom, their joy literally becomes our joy: we are for the moment, as\nhappy as they are: our heart swells and overflows with real pleasure:\njoy and complacency sparkle from our eyes, and animate every feature of\nour countenance, and every gesture of our body.\nBut, on the contrary, when we condole with our friends in their\nafflictions, how little do we feel, in comparison of what they feel? We\nsit down by them, we look at them, and while they relate to us the\ncircumstances of their misfortune, we listen to them with gravity and\nattention. But while their narration is every moment interrupted by\nthose natural bursts of passion which often seem almost to choak them in\nthe midst of it; how far are the languid emotions of our hearts from\nkeeping time to the transports of theirs? We may be sensible, at the\nsame time, that their passion is natural, and no greater than what we\nourselves might feel upon the like occasion. We may even inwardly\nreproach ourselves with our own want of sensibility, and perhaps on that\naccount, work ourselves up into an artificial sympathy, which, however,\nwhen it is raised, is always the slightest and most transitory\nimaginable; and generally, as soon as we have left the room, vanishes,\nand is gone for ever. Nature, it seems, when she has loaded us with our\nown sorrows, thought that they were enough, and therefore did not\ncommand us to take any further share in those of others, than what was\nnecessary to prompt us to relieve them.\nIt is on account of this dull sensibility to the afflictions of others,\nthat magnanimity amidst great distress appears always so divinely\ngraceful. His behaviour is genteel and agreeable who can maintain his\nchearfulness amidst a number of frivolous disasters. But he appears to\nbe more than mortal who can support in the same manner the most dreadful\ncalamities. We feel what an immense effort is requisite to silence those\nviolent emotions which naturally agitate and distract those in his\nsituation. We are amazed to find that he can command himself so\nintirely. His firmness, at the same time, perfectly coincides with our\ninsensibility. He makes no demand upon us for that more exquisite degree\nof sensibility which we find, and which we are mortified to find, that\nwe do not possess. There is the most perfect correspondence between his\nsentiments and ours, and on that account the most perfect propriety in\nhis behaviour. It is a propriety too, which, from our experience of the\nusual weakness of human nature, we could not reasonably have expected he\nshould be able to maintain. We wonder with surprise and astonishment at\nthat strength of mind which is capable of so noble and generous an\neffort. The sentiment of compleat sympathy and approbation, mixed and\nanimated with wonder and surprise, constitutes what is properly called\nadmiration, as has already been more than once taken notice of. Cato,\nsurrounded on all sides by his enemies, unable to resist them, and\ndisdaining to submit to them, and reduced by the proud maxims of that\nage, to the necessity of destroying himself; yet never shrinking from\nhis misfortunes, never supplicating with the lamentable voice of\nwretchedness, those miserable sympathetic tears which we are always so\nunwilling to give; but on the contrary, arming himself with manly\nfortitude, and the moment before he executes his fatal resolution,\ngiving, with his usual tranquillity, all necessary orders for the safety\nof his friends; appears to Seneca, that great preacher of insensibility,\na spectacle which even the gods themselves might behold with pleasure\nand admiration.\nWhenever we meet, in common life, with any examples of such heroic\nmagnanimity, we are always extremely affected. We are more apt to weep\nand shed tears for such as, in this manner, seem to feel nothing for\nthemselves, than for those who give way to all the weakness of sorrow:\nand in this particular case, the sympathetic grief of the spectator\nappears to go beyond the original passion in the person principally\nconcerned. The friends of Socrates all wept when he drank the last\npotion, while he himself expressed the gayest and most chearful\ntranquillity. Upon all such occasions the spectator makes no effort, and\nhas no occasion to make any, in order to conquer his sympathetic sorrow.\nHe is under no fear that it will transport him to any thing that is\nextravagant and improper; he is rather pleased with the sensibility of\nhis own heart, and gives way to it with complacence and\nself-approbation. He gladly indulges, therefore, the most melancholy\nviews which can naturally occur to him, concerning the calamity of his\nfriend, for whom, perhaps, he never felt so exquisitely before, the\ntender and tearful passion of love. But it is quite otherwise with the\nperson principally concerned. He is obliged as much as possible, to turn\naway his eyes from whatever is either naturally terrible or disagreeable\nin his situation. Too serious an attention to those circumstances, he\nfears, might make so violent an impression upon him, that he could no\nlonger keep within the bounds of moderation, or render himself the\nobject of the complete sympathy and approbation of the spectators. He\nfixes his thoughts, therefore, upon those only which are agreeable; the\napplause and admiration which he is about to deserve by the heroic\nmagnanimity of his behaviour. To feel that he is capable of so noble and\ngenerous an effort, to feel that in this dreadful situation he can still\nact as he would desire to act, animates and transports him with joy, and\nenables him to support that triumphant gaiety which seems to exult in\nthe victory he thus gains over his misfortunes.\nOn the contrary, he always appears, in some measure, mean and\ndespicable, who is sunk in sorrow and dejection upon account of any\ncalamity of his own. We cannot bring ourselves to feel for him what he\nfeels for himself, and what, perhaps, we should feel for ourselves if in\nhis situation: we, therefore, despise him; unjustly, perhaps, if any\nsentiment could be regarded as unjust, to which we are by nature\nirresistibly determined. The weakness of sorrow never appears in any\nrespect agreeable, except when it arises from what we feel for others\nmore than from what we feel for ourselves. A son, upon the death of an\nindulgent and respectable father, may give way to it without much blame.\nHis sorrow is chiefly founded upon a sort of sympathy with his departed\nparent; and we readily enter into this humane emotion. But if he should\nindulge the same weakness upon account of any misfortune which affected\nhimself only, he would no longer meet with any such indulgence. If he\nshould be reduced to beggary and ruin, if he should be exposed to the\nmost dreadful dangers, if he should even be led out to a public\nexecution, and there shed one single tear upon the scaffold, he would\ndisgrace himself for ever in the opinion of all the gallant and generous\npart of mankind. Their compassion for him, however, would be very\nstrong, and very sincere; but as it would still fall short of this\nexcessive weakness, they would have no pardon for the man who could thus\nexpose himself in the eyes of the world. His behaviour would affect them\nwith shame rather than with sorrow; and the dishonour which he had thus\nbrought upon himself would appear to them the most lamentable\ncircumstance in his misfortune. How did it disgrace the memory of the\nintrepid Duke of Biron, who had so often braved death in the field, that\nhe wept upon the scaffold, when he beheld the state to which he was\nfallen, and remembered the favour and the glory from which his own\nrashness had so unfortunately thrown him!\nCHAP. II.\n_Of the origin of ambition, and of the distinction of ranks._\nIt is because mankind are disposed to sympathize more entirely with our\njoy than with our sorrow, that we make parade of our riches, and conceal\nour poverty. Nothing is so mortifying as to be obliged to expose our\ndistress to the view of the public, and to feel, that though our\nsituation is open to the eyes of all mankind, no mortal conceives for us\nthe half of what we suffer. Nay, it is chiefly from this regard to the\nsentiments of mankind, that we pursue riches and avoid poverty. For to\nwhat purpose is all the toil and bustle of this world? what is the end\nof avarice and ambition, of the pursuit of wealth, of power, and\npre-eminence? Is it to supply the necessities of nature? The wages of\nthe meanest labourer can supply them. We see that they afford him food\nand clothing, the comfort of a house, and of a family. If we examine his\n\u0153conomy with rigor, we should find that he spends a great part of them\nupon conveniences, which may be regarded as superfluities, and that,\nupon extraordinary occasions, he can give something even to vanity and\ndistinction. What then is the cause of our aversion to his situation,\nand why should those who have been educated in the higher ranks of life,\nregard it as worse than death, to be reduced to live, even without\nlabour, upon the same simple fare with him, to dwell under the same\nlowly roof, and to be clothed in the same humble attire? Do they imagine\nthat their stomach is better, or their sleep sounder in a palace than in\na cottage? the contrary has been so often observed, and, indeed, is so\nvery obvious, though it had never been observed, that there is no body\nignorant of it. From whence, then, arises that emulation which runs\nthrough all the different ranks of men, and what are the advantages\nwhich we propose by that great purpose of human life which we call\nbettering our condition? To be observed, to be attended to, to be taken\nnotice of with sympathy, complacency, and approbation, are all the\nadvantages which we can propose to derive from it. It is the vanity, not\nthe ease, or the pleasure, which interests us. But vanity is always\nfounded upon the belief of our being the object of attention and\napprobation. The rich man glories in his riches, because he feels that\nthey naturally draw upon him the attention of the world, and that\nmankind are disposed to go along with him in all those agreeable\nemotions with which the advantages of his situation so readily inspire\nhim. At the thought of this, his heart seems to swell and dilate itself\nwithin him, and he is fonder of his wealth upon this account, than for\nall the other advantages it procures him. The poor man, on the contrary,\nis ashamed of his poverty. He feels that it either places him out of the\nsight of mankind, or, that, if they take any notice of him, they have,\nhowever, scarce any fellow-feeling with the misery and distress which he\nsuffers. He is mortified upon both accounts; for though to be\noverlooked, and to be disapproved of, are things entirely different, yet\nas obscurity covers us from the daylight of honour and approbation, to\nfeel that we are taken no notice of necessarily damps the most agreeable\nhope, and disappoints the most ardent desire, of human nature. The poor\nman goes out and comes in unheeded, and when in the midst of a croud is\nin the same obscurity as if shut up in his own hovel. Those humble cares\nand painful attentions which occupy those in his situation, afford no\namusement to the dissipated and the gay. They turn away their eyes from\nhim, or if the extremity of his distress forces them to look at him, it\nis only to spurn so disagreeable an object from among them. The\nfortunate and the proud wonder at the insolence of human wretchedness,\nthat it should dare to present itself before them, and with the\nloathsome aspect of its misery, presume to disturb the serenity of their\nhappiness. The man of rank and distinction, on the contrary, is observed\nby all the world. Every body is eager to look at him, and to conceive,\nat least by sympathy, that joy and exultation with which his\ncircumstances naturally inspire him. His actions are the objects of the\npublic care. Scarce a word, scarce a gesture, can fall from him that is\naltogether neglected. In a great assembly he is the person upon whom all\ndirect their eyes; it is upon him that their passions seem all to wait\nwith expectation, in order to receive that movement and direction which\nhe shall impress upon them; and if his behaviour is not altogether\nabsurd, he has, every moment, an opportunity of interesting mankind, and\nof rendering himself the object of the observation and fellow-feeling of\nevery body about him. It is this, which notwithstanding the restraint it\nimposes, notwithstanding the loss of liberty with which it is attended,\nrenders greatness the object of envy, and compensates in the opinion of\nmankind, all that toil, all that anxiety, all those mortifications which\nmust be undergone in the pursuit of it; and what is of yet more\nconsequence, all that leisure, all that ease, all that careless\nsecurity, which are forfeited for ever by the acquisition.\nWhen we consider the condition of the great, in those delusive colours\nin which the imagination is apt to paint it, it seems to be almost the\nabstract idea of a perfect and happy state. It is the very state which,\nin all our waking dreams and idle reveries, we had sketched out to\nourselves as the final object of all our desires. We feel, therefore, a\npeculiar sympathy with the satisfaction of those who are in it. We\nfavour all their inclinations, and forward all their wishes. What pity,\nwe think, that any thing should spoil and corrupt so agreeable a\nsituation! We could even wish them immortal; and it seems hard to us,\nthat death should at last put an end to such perfect enjoyment. It is\ncruel, we think, in Nature, to compel them from their exalted stations\nto that humble, but hospitable home, which she has provided for all her\nchildren. Great King, live for ever! is the compliment, which after the\nmanner of eastern adulation, we should readily make them, if experience\ndid not teach us its absurdity. Every calamity that befalls them, every\ninjury that is done them, excites in the breast of the spectator ten\ntimes more compassion and resentment than he would have felt, had the\nsame things happened to other men. It is the misfortunes of Kings only\nwhich afford the proper subjects for tragedy. They resemble, in this\nrespect, the misfortunes of lovers. Those two situations are the chief\nwhich interest us upon the theatre; because, in spite of all that reason\nand experience can tell us to the contrary, the prejudices of the\nimagination attach to these two states a happiness superior to any\nother. To disturb, or to put an end to such perfect enjoyment, seems to\nbe the most atrocious of all injuries. The traitor who conspires against\nthe life of his monarch, is thought a greater monster than any other\nmurderer. All the innocent blood that was shed in the civil wars,\nprovoked less indignation than the death of Charles I. A stranger to\nhuman nature, who saw the indifference of men about the misery of their\ninferiors, and the regret and indignation which they feel for the\nmisfortunes and sufferings of those above them, would be apt to imagine,\nthat pain must be more agonizing, and the convulsions of death more\nterrible to persons of higher rank, than to those of meaner stations.\nUpon this disposition of mankind, to go along with all the passions of\nthe rich and the powerful, is founded the distinction of ranks, and the\norder of society. Our obsequiousness to our superiors more frequently\narises from our admiration for the advantages of their situation, than\nfrom any private expectations of benefit from their good-will. Their\nbenefits can extend but to a few; but their fortunes interest almost\nevery body. We are eager to assist them in compleating a system of\nhappiness that approaches so near to perfection; and we desire to serve\nthem for their own sake, without any other recompense but the vanity or\nthe honour of obliging them. Neither is our deference to their\ninclinations founded chiefly, or altogether, upon a regard to the\nutility of such submission, and to the order of society, which is best\nsupported by it. Even when the order of society seems to require that we\nshould oppose them, we can hardly bring ourselves to do it. That kings\nare the servants of the people, to be obeyed, resisted, deposed, or\npunished, as the public conveniency may require, is the doctrine of\nreason and philosophy; but it is not the doctrine of Nature. Nature\nwould teach us to submit to them, for their own sake, to tremble and bow\ndown before their exalted station, to regard their smile as a reward\nsufficient to compensate any services, and to dread their displeasure,\nthough no other evil was to follow from it, as the severest of all\nmortifications. To treat them in any respect as men, to reason and\ndispute with them upon ordinary occasions, requires such resolution,\nthat there are few men whose magnanimity can support them in it, unless\nthey are likewise assisted by familiarity and acquaintance. The\nstrongest motives, the most furious passions, fear, hatred, and\nresentment, are scarce sufficient to balance this natural disposition to\nrespect them: and their conduct must, either justly or unjustly, have\nexcited the highest degree of all those passions, before the bulk of the\npeople can be brought to oppose them with violence, or to desire to see\nthem either punished or deposed. Even when the people have been brought\nthis length, they are apt to relent every moment, and easily relapse\ninto their habitual state of deference to those whom they have been\naccustomed to look upon as their natural superiors. They cannot stand\nthe mortification of their monarch. Compassion soon takes the place of\nresentment, they forget all past provocations, their old principles of\nloyalty revive, and they run to re-establish the ruined authority of\ntheir old master, with the same violence with which they had opposed it.\nThe death of Charles I. brought about the Restoration of the royal\nfamily. Compassion for James II. when he was seized by the populace in\nmaking his escape on ship-board, had almost prevented the Revolution,\nand made it go on more heavily than before.\nDo the great seem insensible of the easy price at which they may acquire\nthe public admiration; or do they seem to imagine that to them, as to\nother men, it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood? By what\nimportant accomplishments is the young nobleman instructed to support\nthe dignity of his rank, and to render himself worthy of that\nsuperiority over his fellow-citizens, to which the virtue of his\nancestors had raised them? Is it by knowledge, by industry, by patience,\nby self-denial, or by virtue of any kind? As all his words, as all his\nmotions are attended to, he learns an habitual regard to every\ncircumstance of ordinary behaviour, and studies to perform all those\nsmall duties with the most exact propriety. As he is conscious how much\nhe is observed, and how much mankind are disposed to favour all his\ninclinations, he acts, upon the most indifferent occasions, with that\nfreedom and elevation which the thought of this naturally inspires. His\nair, his manner, his deportment, all mark that elegant and graceful\nsense of his own superiority, which those who are born to inferior\nstations can hardly ever arrive at: these are the arts by which he\nproposes to make mankind more easily submit to his authority, and to\ngovern their inclinations according to his own pleasure: and in this he\nis seldom disappointed. These arts, supported by rank and pre-eminence,\nare, upon ordinary occasions, sufficient to govern the world. Lewis XIV.\nduring the greater part of his reign, was regarded, not only in France,\nbut over all Europe, as the most perfect model of a great prince. But\nwhat were the talents and virtues by which he acquired this great\nreputation? Was it by the scrupulous and inflexible justice of all his\nundertakings, by the immense dangers and difficulties with which they\nwere attended, or by the unwearied and unrelenting application with\nwhich he pursued them? Was it by his extensive knowledge, by his\nexquisite judgment, or by his heroic valour? It was by none of these\nqualities. But he was, first of all, the most powerful prince in Europe,\nand consequently held the highest rank among kings; and then, says his\nhistorian, \u201che surpassed all his courtiers in the gracefulness of his\nshape, and the majestic beauty of his features. The sound of his voice,\nnoble and affecting, gained those hearts which his presence intimidated.\nHe had a step and deportment which could suit only him and his rank, and\nwhich would have been ridiculous in any other person. The embarrassment\nwhich he occasioned to those who spoke to him, flattered that secret\nsatisfaction with which he felt his own superiority. The old officer,\nwho was confounded and faultered in asking him a favour, and not being\nable to conclude his discourse, said to him, Sir, your majesty, I hope,\nwill believe that I do not tremble thus before your enemies: had no\ndifficulty to obtain what he demanded.\u201d These frivolous accomplishments,\nsupported by his rank, and, no doubt, too, by a degree of other talents\nand virtues, which seems, however, not to have been much above\nmediocrity, established this prince in the esteem of his own age, and\nhave drawn, even from posterity, a good deal of respect for his memory.\nCompared with those of his own times, and in his own presence, no other\nvirtue, it seems, appeared to have any merit. Knowledge, industry,\nvalour, and beneficence, trembled, were abashed, and lost all dignity\nbefore them.\nBut it is not by accomplishments of this kind, that the man of inferior\nrank must hope to distinguish himself. Politeness is so much the virtue\nof the great, that it will do little honour to any body but themselves.\nThe coxcomb, who imitates their manner, and affects to be eminent by the\nsuperior propriety of his ordinary behaviour, is rewarded with a double\nshare of contempt for his folly and presumption. Why should the man,\nwhom nobody thinks it worth while to look at, be very anxious about the\nmanner in which he holds up his head, or disposes of his arms while he\nwalks through a room? He is occupied surely with a very superfluous\nattention, and with an attention too that marks a sense of his own\nimportance, which no other mortal can go along with. The most perfect\nmodesty and plainness, joined to as much negligence as is consistent\nwith the respect due to the company, ought to be the chief\ncharacteristics of the behaviour of a private man. If ever he hopes to\ndistinguish himself, it must be by more important virtues. He must\nacquire dependants to balance the dependants of the great, and he has no\nother fund to pay them from, but the labour of his body, and the\nactivity of his mind. He must cultivate these therefore: he must acquire\nsuperior knowledge in his profession, and superior industry in the\nexercise of it. He must be patient in labour, resolute in danger, and\nfirm in distress. These talents he must bring into public view, by the\ndifficulty, importance, and, at the same time, good judgment of his\nundertakings, and by the severe and unrelenting application with which\nhe pursues them. Probity and prudence, generosity and frankness, must\ncharacterize his behaviour upon all ordinary occasions; and he must, at\nthe same time, be forward to engage in all those situations in which it\nrequires the greatest talents and virtues to act with propriety, but in\nwhich the greatest applause is to be acquired by those who can acquit\nthemselves with honour. With what impatience does the man of spirit and\nambition, who is depressed by his situation, look round for some great\nopportunity to distinguish himself? No circumstances, which can afford\nthis, appear to him undesirable. He even looks forward with satisfaction\nto the prospect of foreign war, or civil dissension; and, with secret\ntransport and delight, sees through all the confusion and bloodshed\nwhich attend them, the probability of those wished for occasions\npresenting themselves, in which he may draw upon himself the attention\nand admiration of mankind. The man of rank and distinction, on the\ncontrary, whose whole glory consists in the propriety of his ordinary\nbehaviour, who is contented with the humble renown which this can afford\nhim, and has no talents to acquire any other, is unwilling to embarrass\nhimself with what can be attended either with difficulty or distress. To\nfigure at a ball is his great triumph, and to succeed in an intrigue of\ngallantry, his highest exploit. He has an aversion to all public\nconfusions, not from the love of mankind, for the great never look upon\ntheir inferiors as their fellow-creatures; nor yet from want of courage,\nfor in that he is seldom defective; but from a consciousness that he\npossesses none of the virtues which are required in such situations, and\nthat the public attention will certainly be drawn away from him by\nothers. He may be willing to expose himself to some little danger, and\nto make a campaign when it happens to be the fashion. But he shudders\nwith horror at the thought of any situation which demands the continual\nand long exertion of patience, industry, fortitude, and application of\nthought. These virtues are hardly ever to be met with in men who are\nborn to those high stations. In all governments accordingly, even in\nmonarchies, the highest offices are generally possessed, and the whole\ndetail of the administration conducted by men who were educated in the\nmiddle and inferior ranks of life, who have been carried forward by\ntheir own industry and abilities, though loaded with the jealousy, and\nopposed by the resentment of all those who were born their superiors,\nand to whom the great, after having regarded them first with contempt,\nand afterwards with envy, are at last contented to truckle with the same\nabject meanness with which they desire that the rest of mankind should\nbehave to themselves.\nIt is the loss of this easy empire over the affections of mankind which\nrenders the fall from greatness so insupportable. When the family of the\nKing of Macedon was led in triumph by Paulus \u00c6milius, their misfortunes,\nit is said, made them divide with their conqueror the attention of the\nRoman people. The sight of the royal children, whose tender age rendered\nthem insensible of their situation, struck the spectators, amidst the\npublic rejoicings and prosperity, with the tenderest sorrow and\ncompassion. The King appeared next in the procession; and seemed like\none confounded and astonished, and bereft of all sentiment, by the\ngreatness of his calamities. His friends and ministers followed after\nhim. As they moved along, they often cast their eye upon their fallen\nsovereign, and always burst into tears at the sight; their whole\nbehaviour demonstrating that they thought not of their misfortunes, but\nwere occupied entirely by the superior greatness of his. The generous\nRomans, on the contrary, beheld him with disdain and indignation, and\nregarded as unworthy of all compassion the man who could be so\nmean-spirited as to bear to live under such calamities. Yet what did\nthose calamities amount to? According to the greater part of historians,\nhe was to spend the remainder of his days under the protection of a\npowerful and humane people, in a state which in itself should seem\nworthy of envy, a state of plenty, ease, leisure, and security, from\nwhich it was impossible for him even by his own folly to fall. But he\nwas no longer to be surrounded by that admiring mob of fools,\nflatterers, and dependants, who had formerly been accustomed to attend\nupon all his motions. He was no longer to be gazed upon by multitudes,\nnor to have it in his power to render himself the object of their\nrespect, their gratitude, their love, their admiration. The passions of\nnations were no longer to mould themselves upon his inclinations. This\nwas that insupportable calamity which bereaved the King of all\nsentiment; which made his friends forget their own misfortunes; and\nwhich the Roman magnanimity could scarce conceive how any man could be\nso mean-spirited as to bear to survive.\n\u201cLove, says my Lord Rochefoucault, is commonly succeeded by ambition;\nbut ambition is hardly ever succeeded by love.\u201d That passion when once\nit has got entire possession of the breast, will admit neither a rival\nnor a successor. To those who have been accustomed to the possession, or\neven to the hope of public admiration, all other pleasures sicken and\ndecay. Of all the discarded statesmen who for their own ease have\nstudied to get the better of ambition, and to despise those honours\nwhich they could no longer arrive at, how few have been able to succeed?\nThe greater part have spent their time in the most listless and insipid\nindolence, chagrined at the thoughts of their own insignificancy,\nincapable of being interested in the occupations of private life,\nwithout enjoyment except when they talked of their former greatness, and\nwithout satisfaction except when they were employed in some vain project\nto recover it. Are you in earnest resolved never to barter your liberty\nfor the lordly servitude of a Court, but to live free, fearless, and\nindependent? There seems to be one way to continue in that virtuous\nresolution; and perhaps but one. Never enter the place from whence so\nfew have been able to return; never come within the circle of ambition;\nnor even bring yourself into comparison with those masters of the earth\nwho have already engrossed the attention of half mankind before you.\nOf such mighty importance does it appear to be, in the imaginations of\nmen, to stand in that situation which sets them most in the view of\ngeneral sympathy and attention. And thus, place, that great object which\ndivides the wives of aldermen, is the end of half the labours of life;\nand is the cause of all the tumult and bustle, all the rapine and\ninjustice, which avarice and ambition have introduced into this world.\nPeople of sense, it is said, indeed despise place; that is, they despise\nsitting at the head of the table, and are indifferent who it is that is\npointed out to the company by that frivolous circumstance, which the\nsmallest advantage is capable of overbalancing. But rank, distinction,\npre-eminence, no man despises, unless he is either raised very much\nabove, or sunk very much below, the ordinary standard of human nature;\nunless he is either so confirmed in wisdom and real philosophy, as to be\nsatisfied that, while the propriety of his conduct renders him the just\nobject of approbation, it is of little consequence though he be neither\nattended to, nor approved of; or so habituated to the idea of his own\nmeanness, so sunk in slothful and sottish indifference, as entirely to\nhave forgot the desire, and almost the very wish, for superiority.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of the stoical philosophy._\nWhen we examine in this manner into the ground of the different degrees\nof estimation which mankind are apt to bestow upon the different\nconditions of life, we shall find, that the excessive preference, which\nthey generally give to some of them above others, is in a great measure\nwithout any foundation. If to be able to act with propriety, and to\nrender ourselves the proper objects of the approbation of mankind, be,\nas we have been endeavouring to show, what chiefly recommends to us one\ncondition above another, this may equally be attained in them all. The\nnoblest propriety of conduct may be supported in adversity, as well as\nin prosperity; and though it is somewhat more difficult in the first, it\nis upon that very account more admirable. Perils and misfortunes are not\nonly the proper school of heroism, they are the only proper theatre\nwhich can exhibit its virtue to advantage, and draw upon it the full\napplause of the world. The man, whose whole life has been one even and\nuninterrupted course of prosperity, who never braved any danger, who\nnever encountered any difficulty, who never surmounted any distress, can\nexcite but an inferior degree of admiration. When poets and\nromance-writers endeavour to invent a train of adventures, which shall\ngive the greatest lustre to those characters for whom they mean to\ninterest us, they are all of a different kind. They are rapid and sudden\nchanges of fortune, situations the most apt to drive those who are in\nthem to frenzy and distraction, or to abject despair; but in which their\nheroes act with so much propriety, or at least with so much spirit and\nundaunted resolution, as still to command our esteem. Is not the\nunfortunate magnanimity of Cato, Brutus, and Leonidas, as much the\nobject of admiration, as that of the successful C\u00e6sar or Alexander? To a\ngenerous mind, therefore, ought it not to be as much the object of envy?\nIf a more dazzling splendor seems to attend the fortunes of successful\nconquerors, it is because they join together the advantages of both\nsituations, the lustre of prosperity to the high admiration which is\nexcited by dangers encountered, and difficulties surmounted, with\nintrepidity and valour.\nIt was upon this account that, according to the stoical philosophy, to a\nwise man all the different conditions of life were equal. Nature, they\nsaid, had recommended some objects to our choice, and others to our\ndisapprobation. Our primary appetites directed us to the pursuit of\nhealth, strength, ease, and perfection, in all the qualities of mind and\nbody; and of whatever could promote or secure these, riches, power,\nauthority: and the same original principle taught us to avoid the\ncontrary. But in chusing or rejecting, in preferring or postponing,\nthose first objects of original appetite and aversion, Nature had\nlikewise taught us, that there was a certain order, propriety, and\ngrace, to be observed, of infinitely greater consequence to happiness\nand perfection, than the attainment of those objects themselves. The\nobjects of our primary appetites or aversions were to be pursued or\navoided, chiefly because a regard to this grace and propriety required\nsuch conduct. In directing all our actions according to these, consisted\nthe happiness and glory of human nature. In departing from those rules\nwhich they prescribed to us, its greatest wretchedness and most complete\ndepravity. The outward appearance of this order and propriety was indeed\nmore easily maintained in some circumstances than in others. To a fool,\nhowever, to one whose passions were subjected to no proper controul, to\nact with real grace and propriety, was equally impossible in every\nsituation. Though the giddy multitude might admire him, though his\nvanity might sometimes be elevated by their ignorant praises into\nsomething that resembled self-approbation, yet still when he turned his\nview to what passed within his own breast, he was secretly conscious to\nhimself of the absurdity and meanness of all his motives, and inwardly\nblushed and trembled at the thoughts of the contempt which he knew he\ndeserved, and which mankind would certainly bestow upon him if they saw\nhis conduct in the light in which in his own heart he was obliged to\nregard it. To a wise man, on the contrary, to one whose passions were\nall brought under perfect subjection to the ruling principles of his\nnature, to reason and the love of propriety, to act so as to deserve\napprobation was equally easy upon all occasions. Was he in prosperity,\nhe returned thanks to Jupiter for having joined him with circumstances\nwhich were easily mastered, and in which there was little temptation to\ndo wrong. Was he in adversity, he equally, returned thanks to the\ndirector of this spectacle of human life, for having opposed to him a\nvigorous athlete, over whom, though the contest was likely to be more\nviolent, the victory was more glorious, and equally certain. Can there\nbe any shame in that distress which is brought upon us without any fault\nof our own, and in which we behave with perfect propriety? There can\ntherefore, be no evil, but, on the contrary, the greatest good and\nadvantage. A brave man exults in those dangers, in which, from no\nrashness of his own, his fortune has involved him. They afford an\nopportunity of exercising that heroic intrepidity, whose exertion gives\nthe exalted delight which flows from the consciousness of superior\npropriety and deserved admiration. One who is master of all his\nexercises has no aversion to measure his strength and activity with the\nstrongest. And in the same manner, one who is master of all his\npassions, does not dread any circumstances in which the superintendant\nof the universe may think proper to place him. The bounty of that Divine\nBeing has provided him with virtues which render him superior to every\nsituation. If it is pleasure, he has temperance to refrain from it; if\nit is pain, he has constancy to bear it; if it is danger or death, he\nhas magnanimity and fortitude to despise it. He never complains of the\ndestiny of providence, nor thinks the universe in confusion when he is\nout of order. He does not look upon himself, according to what self-love\nwould suggest, as a whole, separated and detached from every other part\nof nature, to be taken care of by itself, and for itself. He regards\nhimself in the light in which he imagines the great Genius of human\nnature, and of the world, regards him. He enters, if I may say so, into\nthe sentiments of that Divine Being, and considers himself as an atom, a\nparticle, of an immense and infinite system, which must, and ought to be\ndisposed of, according to the conveniency of the whole. Assured of the\nwisdom which directs all the events of human life, whatever lot befalls\nhim, he accepts it with joy, satisfied that, if he had known all the\nconnexions and dependencies of the different parts of the universe, it\nis the very lot which he himself would have wished for. If it is life,\nhe is contented to live: and if it is death, as Nature must have no\nfurther occasion for his presence here, he willingly goes where he is\nappointed. I accept, said a stoical philosopher, with equal joy and\nsatisfaction, whatever fortune can befal me. Riches or poverty, pleasure\nor pain, health or sickness, all is alike: nor would I desire that the\ngods should in any respect change my destination. If I was to ask of\nthem any thing, beyond what their bounty has already bestowed, it should\nbe that they would inform me beforehand what it was their pleasure\nshould be done with me, that I might of my own accord place myself in\nthis situation, and demonstrate the chearfulness with which I embraced\ntheir allotment. If I am going to fail, says Epictetus, I chuse the best\nship, and the best pilot, and I wait for the fairest weather that my\ncircumstances and duty will allow. Prudence and propriety, the\nprinciples which the gods have given me for the direction of my conduct,\nrequire this of me; but they require no more: and if, notwithstanding, a\nstorm arises, which neither the strength of the vessel, nor the skill of\nthe pilot are likely to withstand, I give myself no trouble about the\nconsequence. All that I had to do, is done already. The directors of my\nconduct never command me to be miserable, to be anxious, desponding, or\nafraid. Whether we are to be drowned, or to come to a harbour, is the\nbusiness of Jupiter, not mine. I leave it entirely to his determination,\nnor ever break my rest with considering which way he is likely to decide\nit, but receive whatever comes with equal indifference and security.\nSuch was the philosophy of the stoics, a philosophy which affords the\nnoblest lessons of magnanimity, is the best school of heroes and\npatriots, and to the greater part of whose precepts there can be no\nobjection, except that honourable one, that they teach us to aim at a\nperfection altogether beyond the reach of human nature. I shall not at\npresent stop to examine it. I shall only observe, in confirmation of\nwhat has formerly been said, that the most dreadful calamities are not\nalways those which it is most difficult to support. It is often more\nmortifying to appear in public, under small disasters, than under great\nmisfortunes. The first excite no sympathy; but the second, though they\nmay excite none that approaches to the anguish of the sufferer, call\nforth, however, a very lively compassion. The sentiments of the\nspectators are, in this last case, therefore, less wide of those of the\nsufferer, and their imperfect fellow-feeling lends him some assistance\nin supporting his misery. Before a gay assembly, a gentleman would be\nmore mortified to appear covered with filth and rags than with blood and\nwounds. This last situation would interest their pity; the other would\nprovoke their laughter. The judge who orders a criminal to be set in the\npillory, dishonours him more than if he had condemned him to the\nscaffold. The great prince, who, some years ago, caned a general officer\nat the head of his army, disgraced him irrecoverably. The punishment\nwould have been much less had he shot him through the body. By the laws\nof honour, to strike with a cane dishonours, to strike with a sword does\nnot, for an obvious reason. Those slighter punishments when inflicted on\na gentleman, to whom dishonour is the greatest of all evils, come to be\nregarded among a humane and generous people, as the most dreadful of\nany. With regard to persons of that rank, therefore, they are\nuniversally laid aside, and the law, while it takes their life upon many\noccasions, respects their honour upon almost all. To scourge a person of\nquality, or to set him in the pillory, upon account of any crime\nwhatever, is a brutality of which no European government, except that of\nRussia, is capable.\nA brave man is not rendered contemptible by being brought to the\nscaffold; he is, by being set in the pillory. His behaviour in the one\nsituation may gain him universal esteem and admiration. No behaviour in\nthe other can render him agreeable. The sympathy of the spectators\nsupports him in the one case, and saves him from that shame, that\nconsciousness that his misery is felt by himself only, which is of all\nsentiments the most unsupportable. There is no sympathy in the other;\nor, if there is any, it is not with his pain, which is a trifle, but\nwith his consciousness of the want of sympathy with which this pain is\nattended. It is with his shame, not with his sorrow. Those who pity him,\nblush and hang down their heads for him. He droops in the same manner,\nand feels himself irrecoverably degraded by the punishment, though not\nby the crime. The man, on the contrary, who dies with resolution, as he\nis naturally regarded with the erect aspect of esteem and approbation,\nso he wears himself the same undaunted countenance; and, if the crime\ndoes not deprive him of the respect of others, the punishment never\nwill. He has no suspicion that his situation is the object of contempt\nor derision to any body, and he can, with propriety, assume the air, not\nonly of perfect serenity, but of triumph and exaltation.\n\u201cGreat dangers,\u201d says the Cardinal de Retz, \u201chave their charms, because\nthere is some glory to be got, even when we miscarry. But moderate\ndangers have nothing but what is horrible, because the loss of\nreputation always attends the want of success.\u201d His maxim has the same\nfoundation with what we have been just now observing with regard to\npunishments.\nHuman virtue is superior to pain, to poverty, to danger, and to death;\nnor does it even require its utmost efforts to despise them. But to have\nits misery exposed to insult and derision, to be led in triumph, to be\nset up for the hand of scorn to point at, is a situation in which its\nconstancy is much more apt to fail. Compared with the contempt of\nmankind, all other evils are easily supported.\nPART II.\nOf MERIT and DEMERIT; or, of the Objects of REWARD and PUNISHMENT.\nCONSISTING OF THREE SECTIONS.\nSECTION I.\nOf the sense of merit and demerit.\nINTRODUCTION.\nThere is another set of qualities ascribed to the actions and conduct of\nmankind, distinct from their propriety or impropriety, their decency or\nungracefulness, and which are the objects of a distinct species of\napprobation and disapprobation. These are merit and demerit, the\nqualities of deserving reward, and of deserving punishment.\nIt has already been observed, that the sentiment or affection of the\nheart, from which any action proceeds, and upon which its whole virtue\nor vice depends, may be considered under two different aspects, or in\ntwo different relations: first, in relation to the cause or object which\nexcites it; and, secondly, in relation to the end which it proposes, or\nto the effect which it tends to produce: that upon the suitableness or\nunsuitableness, upon the proportion or disproportion, which the\naffection seems to bear to the cause or object which excites it, depends\nthe propriety or impropriety, the decency or ungracefulness of the\nconsequent action; and that upon the beneficial or hurtful effects which\nthe affection proposes or tends to produce, depends the merit or\ndemerit, the good or ill desert of the action to which it gives\noccasion. Wherein consists our sense of the propriety or impropriety of\nactions, has been explained in the former part of this discourse. We\ncome now to consider, wherein consists that of their good or ill desert.\nCHAP. I.\n_That whatever appears to be the proper object of gratitude, appears to\ndeserve reward; and that, in the same manner, whatever appears to be the\nproper object of resentment, appears to deserve punishment._\nTo us, therefore, that action must appear to deserve reward, which\nappears to be the proper and approved object of that sentiment, which\nmost immediately and directly prompts us to reward, or to do good to\nanother. And in the same manner, that action must appear to deserve\npunishment, which appears to be the proper and approved object of that\nsentiment which most immediately and directly prompts us to publish, or\ninflict evil upon another.\nThe sentiment which most immediately and directly prompts us to reward,\nis gratitude; that which most immediately and directly prompts us to\npunish, is resentment.\nTo us, therefore, that action must appear to deserve reward, which\nappears to be the proper and approved object of gratitude; as, on the\nother hand, that action must appear to deserve punishment, which appears\nto be the proper and approved object of resentment.\nTo reward, is to recompense, to remunerate, to return good for good\nreceived. To punish, too, is to recompense, to remunerate, though in a\ndifferent manner; it is to return evil for evil that has been done.\nThere are some other passions, besides gratitude and resentment, which\ninterest us in the happiness or misery of others; but there are none\nwhich so directly excite us to be the instruments of either. The love\nand esteem which grow upon acquaintance and habitual approbation,\nnecessarily lead us to be pleased with the good fortune of the man who\nis the object of such agreeable emotions, and consequently, to be\nwilling to lend a hand to promote it. Our love, however, is fully\nsatisfied, though his good fortune should be brought about without our\nassistance. All that this passion desires is to see him happy, without\nregarding who was the author of his prosperity. But gratitude is not to\nbe satisfied in this manner. If the person to whom we owe many\nobligations, is made happy without our assistance, though it pleases our\nlove, it does not content our gratitude. Till we have recompensed him,\ntill we ourselves have been instrumental in promoting his happiness, we\nfeel ourselves still loaded with that debt which his past services have\nlaid upon us.\nThe hatred and dislike, in the same manner, which grow upon habitual\ndisapprobation, would often lead us to take a malicious pleasure in the\nmisfortune of the man whose conduct and character excite so painful a\npassion. But though dislike and hatred harden us against all sympathy,\nand sometimes dispose us even to rejoice at the distress of another,\nyet, if there is no resentment in the case, if neither we nor our\nfriends have received any great personal provocation, these passions\nwould not naturally lead us to wish to be instrumental in bringing it\nabout. Tho\u2019 we could fear no punishment in consequence of our having had\nsome hand it, we would rather that it should happen by other means. To\none under the dominion of violent hatred it would be agreeable, perhaps,\nto hear, that the person whom he abhorred and detested was killed by\nsome accident. But if he had the least spark of justice, which, though\nthis passion is not very favourable to virtue, he might still have, it\nwould hurt him excessively to have been himself, even without design,\nthe occasion of this misfortune. Much more would the very thought of\nvoluntarily contributing to it shock him beyond all measure. He would\nreject with horror even the imagination of so execrable a design; and if\nhe could imagine himself capable of such an enormity, he would begin to\nregard himself in the same odious light in which he had considered the\nperson who was the object of his dislike. But it is quite otherwise with\nresentment: if the person who had done us some great injury, who had\nmurdered our father or our brother, for example, should soon afterwards\ndie of a fever, or even be brought to the scaffold upon account of some\nother crime, though it might sooth our hatred, it would not fully\ngratify our resentment. Resentment would prompt us to desire, not only\nthat he should be punished, but that he should be punished by our means,\nand upon account of that particular injury which he had done to us.\nResentment cannot be fully gratified, unless the offender is not only\nmade to grieve in his turn, but to grieve for that particular wrong\nwhich we have suffered from him. He must be made to repent and be sorry\nfor this very action, that others, through fear of the like punishment,\nmay be terrified from being guilty of the like offence. The natural\ngratification of this passion tends, of its own accord, to produce all\nthe political ends of punishment; the correction of the criminal, and\nthe example to the public.\nGratitude and resentment, therefore, are the sentiments which most\nimmediately and directly prompt to reward and to punish. To us,\ntherefore, he must appear to deserve reward, who appears to be the\nproper and approved object of gratitude; and he to deserve punishment,\nwho appears to be that of resentment.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of the proper objects of gratitude and resentment._\nTo be the proper and approved object either of gratitude or resentment,\ncan mean nothing but to be the object of that gratitude, and of that\nresentment, which naturally seems proper, and is approved of.\nBut these, as well as all the other passions of human nature, seem\nproper and are approved of, when the heart of every impartial spectator\nentirely sympathizes with them, when every indifferent by-stander\nentirely enters into, and goes along with them.\nHe, therefore, appears to deserve reward, who, to some person or\npersons, is the natural object of a gratitude which every human heart is\ndisposed to beat time to, and thereby applaud: and he, on the other\nhand, appears to deserve punishment, who in the same manner is to some\nperson or persons the natural object of a resentment which the breast of\nevery reasonable man is ready to adopt and sympathize with. To us,\nsurely, that action must appear to deserve reward, which every body who\nknows of it would wish to reward, and therefore delights to see\nrewarded: and that action must as surely appear to deserve punishment,\nwhich every body who hears of it is angry with, and upon that account\nrejoices to see punished.\n1. As we sympathize with the joy of our companions when in prosperity,\nso we join with them in the complacency and satisfaction with which they\nnaturally regard whatever is the cause of their good fortune. We enter\ninto the love and affection which they conceive for it, and begin to\nlove it too. We should be sorry for their sakes if it was destroyed, or\neven if it was placed at too great a distance from them, and out of the\nreach of their care and protection, though they should lose nothing by\nits absence except the pleasure of seeing it. If it is man who has thus\nbeen the fortunate instrument of the happiness of his brethren, this is\nstill more peculiarly the case. When we see one man assisted, protected,\nrelieved by another, our sympathy with the joy of the person who\nreceives the benefit serves only to animate our fellow-feeling with his\ngratitude towards him who bestows it. When we look upon the person who\nis the cause of his pleasure with the eyes with which we imagine he must\nlook upon him, his benefactor seems to stand before us in the most\nengaging and amiable light. We readily therefore sympathize with the\ngrateful affection which he conceives for a person to whom he has been\nso much obliged; and consequently applaud the returns which he is\ndisposed to make for the good offices conferred upon him. As we entirely\nenter into the affection from which these returns proceed, they\nnecessarily seem every way proper and suitable to their object.\n2. In the same manner, as we sympathize with the sorrow of our\nfellow-creature whenever we see his distress, so we likewise enter into\nhis abhorrence and aversion for whatever has given occasion to it. Our\nheart, as it adopts and beats time to his grief, so is it likewise\nanimated with that spirit by which he endeavours to drive away or\ndestroy the cause of it. The indolent and passive fellow-feeling, by\nwhich we accompany him in his sufferings, readily gives way to that more\nvigorous and active sentiment by which we go along with him in the\neffort he makes, either to repel them, or to gratify his aversion to\nwhat has given occasion to them. This is still more peculiarly the case,\nwhen it is man who has caused them. When we see one man oppressed or\ninjured by another, the sympathy which we feel with the distress of the\nsufferer seems to serve only to animate our fellow-feeling with his\nresentment against the offender. We are rejoiced to see him attack his\nadversary in his turn, and are eager and ready to assist him whenever he\nexerts himself for defence, or even for vengeance within a certain\ndegree. If the injured should perish in the quarrel, we not only\nsympathize with the real resentment of his friends and relations, but\nwith the imaginary resentment which in fancy we lend to the dead, who is\nno longer capable of feeling that or any other human sentiment. But as\nwe put ourselves in his situation, as we enter, as it were, into his\nbody, and in our imaginations, in some measure, animate anew the\ndeformed and mangled carcass of the slain, when we bring home in this\nmanner his case to our own bosoms, we feel upon this, as upon many other\noccasions, an emotion which the person principally concerned is\nincapable of feeling, and which yet we feel by an illusive sympathy with\nhim. The sympathetic tears which we shed for that immense and\nirretrievable loss, which in our fancy he appears to have sustained,\nseem to be but a small part of the duty which we owe him. The injury\nwhich he has suffered demands, we think, a principal part of our\nattention. We feel that resentment which we imagine he ought to feel,\nand which he would feel, if in his cold and lifeless body there remained\nany consciousness of what passes upon earth. His blood, we think, calls\naloud for vengeance. The very ashes of the dead seem to be disturbed at\nthe thought that his injuries are to pass unrevenged. The horrors which\nare supposed to haunt the bed of the murderer, the ghosts which,\nsuperstition imagines, rise from their graves to demand vengeance upon\nthose who brought them to an untimely end, all take their origin from\nthis natural sympathy with the imaginary resentment of the slain. And\nwith regard, at least, to this most dreadful of all crimes, Nature,\nantecedent to all reflections upon the utility of punishment, has in\nthis manner stamped upon the human heart, in the strongest and most\nindelible characters, an immediate and instinctive approbation of the\nsacred and necessary law of retaliation.\nCHAP. III.\n_That where there is no approbation of the conduct of the person who\nconfers the benefit, there is little sympathy with the gratitude of him\nwho receives it: and that, on the contrary, where there is no\ndisapprobation of the motives of the person who does the mischief, there\nis no sort of sympathy with the resentment of him who suffers it._\nIt is to be observed, however, that, how beneficial soever on the one\nhand, or how hurtful soever on the other, the actions or intentions of\nthe person who acts may have been to the person who is, if I may say so,\nacted upon, yet if in the one case there appears to have been no\npropriety in the motives of the agent, if we cannot enter into the\naffections which influenced his conduct, we have little sympathy with\nthe gratitude of the person who receives the benefit: or if, in the\nother case, there appears to have been no impropriety in the motives of\nthe agent, if, on the contrary, the affections which influenced his\nconduct are such as we must necessarily enter into, we can have no sort\nof sympathy with the resentment of the person who suffers. Little\ngratitude seems due in the one case, and all sort of resentment seems\nunjust in the other. The one action seems to merit little reward, the\nother to deserve no punishment.\n1. First, I say, that wherever we cannot sympathize with the affections\nof the agent, wherever there seems to be no propriety in the motives\nwhich influenced his conduct, we are less disposed to enter into the\ngratitude of the person who received the benefit of his actions. A very\nsmall return seems due to that foolish and profuse generosity which\nconfers the greatest benefits from the most trivial motives, and gives\nan estate to a man merely because his name and surname happen to be the\nsame with those of the giver. Such services do not seem to demand any\nproportionable recompense. Our contempt for the folly of the agent\nhinders us from thoroughly entering into the gratitude of the person to\nwhom the good office has been done. His benefactor seems unworthy of it.\nAs when we place ourselves in the situation of the person obliged, we\nfeel that we could conceive no great reverence for such a benefactor, we\neasily absolve him from a great deal of that submissive veneration and\nesteem which we should think due to a more respectable character; and\nprovided he always treats his weak friend with kindness and humanity, we\nare willing to excuse him from many attentions and regards which we\nshould demand to a worthier patron. Those Princes, who have heaped, with\nthe greatest profusion, wealth, power, and honours, upon their\nfavourites, have seldom excited that degree of attachment to their\npersons which has often been experienced by those who were more frugal\nof their favours. The well-natured, but injudicious prodigality of James\nthe First of Great Britain seems to have attached no body to his person;\nand that Prince, notwithstanding his social and harmless disposition,\nappears to have lived and died without a friend. The whole gentry and\nnobility of England exposed their lives and fortunes in the cause of his\nmore frugal and distinguishing son, notwithstanding the coldness and\ndistant severity of his ordinary deportment.\n2. Secondly, I say, That wherever the conduct of the agent appears to\nhave been entirely directed by motives and affections which we\nthoroughly enter into and approve of, we can have no sort of sympathy\nwith the resentment of the sufferer, how great soever the mischief which\nmay have been done to him. When two people quarrel, if we take part\nwith, and entirely adopt the resentment of one of them, it is impossible\nthat we should enter into that of the other. Our sympathy with the\nperson whose motives we go along with, and whom therefore we look upon\nas in the right, cannot but harden us against all fellow-feeling with\nthe other, whom we necessarily regard as in the wrong. Whatever this\nlast, therefore, may have suffered, while it is no more than what we\nourselves should have wished him to suffer, while it is no more than\nwhat our own sympathetic indignation would have prompted us to inflict\nupon him, it cannot either displease or provoke us. When an inhuman\nmurderer is brought to the scaffold, though we have some compassion for\nhis misery, we can have no sort of fellow-feeling with his resentment,\nif he should be so absurd as to express any against either his\nprosecutor or his judge. The natural tendency of their just indignation\nagainst so vile a criminal is indeed the most fatal and ruinous to him.\nBut it is impossible that we should be displeased with the tendency of a\nsentiment, which, when we bring the case home to ourselves, we feel that\nwe cannot avoid adopting.\nCHAP. IV.\n_Recapitulation of the foregoing Chapters._\nWe do not, therefore, thoroughly and heartily sympathize with the\ngratitude of one man towards another, merely because this other has been\nthe cause of his good fortune, unless he has been the cause of it from\nmotives which we entirely go along with. Our heart must adopt the\nprinciples of the agent, and go along with all the affections which\ninfluenced his conduct, before it can entirely sympathize with, and beat\ntime to, the gratitude of the person who has been benefited by his\nactions. If in the conduct of the benefactor there appears to have been\nno propriety, how beneficial soever its effects, it does not seem to\ndemand, or necessarily to require, any proportionable recompense.\nBut when to the beneficent tendency of the action is joined the\npropriety of the affection from which it proceeds, when we entirely\nsympathize and go along with the motives of the agent, the love which we\nconceive for him upon his own account, enhances and enlivens our\nfellow-feeling with the gratitude of those who owe their prosperity to\nhis good conduct. His actions seem then to demand, and, if I may say so,\nto call aloud for a proportionable recompense. We then entirely enter\ninto that gratitude which prompts to bestow it. The benefactor seems\nthen to be the proper object of reward, when we thus entirely sympathize\nwith, and approve of, that sentiment which prompts to reward him. When\nwe approve of, and go along with, the affection from which the action\nproceeds, we must necessarily approve of the action, and regard the\nperson towards whom it is directed as its proper and suitable object.\n2. In the same manner, we cannot at all sympathize with the resentment\nof one man against another, merely because this other has been the cause\nof his misfortune, unless he has been the cause of it from motives which\nwe cannot enter into. Before we can adopt the resentment of the\nsufferer, we must disapprove of the motives of the agent, and feel that\nour heart renounces all sympathy with the affections which influenced\nhis conduct. If there appears to have been no impropriety in these, how\nfatal soever the tendency of the action which proceeds from them to\nthose against whom it is directed, it does not seem to deserve any\npunishment, or to be the proper object of any resentment.\nBut when to the hurtfulness of the action is joined the impropriety of\nthe affection from whence it proceeds, when our heart rejects with\nabhorrence all fellow-feeling with the motives of the agent, we then\nheartily and entirely sympathize with the resentment of the sufferer.\nSuch actions seem then to deserve, and, if I may say so, to call aloud\nfor, a proportionable punishment; and we entirely enter into, and\nthereby approve of, that resentment which prompts to inflict it. The\noffender necessarily seems then to be the proper object of punishment,\nwhen we thus entirely sympathize with, and thereby approve of, that\nsentiment which prompts to punish. In this case too, when we approve,\nand go along with, the affection from which the action proceeds, we must\nnecessarily approve of the action, and regard the person against whom it\nis directed, as its proper and suitable object.\nCHAP. V.\n_The analysis of the sense of merit and demerit._\n1. As our sense, therefore, of the propriety of conduct arises from what\nI shall call a direct sympathy with the affections and motives of the\nperson who acts, so our sense of its merit arises from what I shall call\nan indirect sympathy with the gratitude of the person who is, if I may\nsay so, acted upon.\nAs we cannot indeed enter thoroughly into the gratitude of the person\nwho receives the benefit, unless we beforehand approve of the motives of\nthe benefactor, so, upon this account, the sense of merit seems to be a\ncompounded sentiment, and to be made up of two distinct emotions; a\ndirect sympathy with the sentiments of the agent, and an indirect\nsympathy with the gratitude of those who receive the benefit of his\nactions.\nWe may, upon many different occasions, plainly distinguish those two\ndifferent emotions combining and uniting together in our sense of the\ngood desert of a particular character or action. When we read in history\nconcerning actions of proper and beneficent greatness of mind, how\neagerly do we enter into such designs? How much are we animated by that\nhigh-spirited generosity which directs them? How keen are we for their\nsuccess? How grieved at their disappointment? In imagination we become\nthe very person whose actions are represented to us: we transport\nourselves in fancy to the scenes of those distant and forgotten\nadventures, and imagine ourselves acting the part of a Scipio or a\nCamillus, a Timoleon or an Aristides. So far our sentiments are founded\nupon the direct sympathy with the person who acts. Nor is the indirect\nsympathy with those who receive the benefit of such actions less\nsensibly felt. Whenever we place ourselves in the situation of these\nlast, with what warm and affectionate fellow-feeling do we enter into\ntheir gratitude towards those who served them so essentially? We\nembrace, as it were, their benefactor along with them. Our heart readily\nsympathizes with the highest transports of their grateful affection. No\nhonours, no rewards, we think, can be too great for them to bestow upon\nhim. When they make this proper return for his services, we heartily\napplaud and go along with them; but are shocked beyond all measure, if\nby their conduct they appear to have little sense of the obligations\nconferred upon them. Our whole sense, in short, of the merit and good\ndesert of such actions, of the propriety and fitness of recompensing\nthem, and making the person who performed them rejoice in his turn,\narises from the sympathetic emotions of gratitude and love, with which,\nwhen we bring home to our own breast the situation of those principally\nconcerned, we feel ourselves naturally transported towards the man who\ncould act with such proper and noble beneficence.\n2. In the same manner as our sense of the impropriety of conduct arises\nfrom a want of sympathy, or from a direct antipathy to the affections\nand motives of the agent, so our sense of its demerit arises from what I\nshall here too call an indirect sympathy with the resentment of the\nsufferer.\nAs we cannot indeed enter into the resentment of the sufferer, unless\nour heart beforehand disapproves the motives of the agent, and renounces\nall fellow-feeling with them; so upon this account the sense of demerit,\nas well as that of merit, seems to be a compounded sentiment, and to be\nmade up of two distinct emotions; a direct antipathy to the sentiments\nof the agent, and an indirect sympathy with the resentment of the\nsufferer.\nWe may here too, upon many different occasions, plainly distinguish\nthose two different emotions combining and uniting together in our sense\nof the ill desert of a particular character or action. When we read in\nhistory concerning the perfidy and cruelty of a Borgia or a Nero, our\nheart rises up against the detestable sentiments which influenced their\nconduct, and renounces with horror and abomination all fellow-feeling\nwith such execrable motives. So far our sentiments are founded upon the\ndirect antipathy to the affections of the agent: and the indirect\nsympathy with the resentment of the sufferers is still more sensibly\nfelt. When we bring home to ourselves the situation of the persons whom\nthose scourges of mankind insulted, murdered, or betrayed, what\nindignation do we not feel against such insolent and inhuman oppressors\nof the earth? Our sympathy with the unavoidable distress of the innocent\nsufferers is not more real nor more lively, than our fellow-feeling with\ntheir just and natural resentment. The former sentiment only heightens\nthe latter, and the idea of their distress serves only to inflame and\nblow up our animosity against those who occasioned it. When we think of\nthe anguish of the sufferers, we take part with them more earnestly\nagainst their oppressors; we enter with more eagerness into all their\nschemes of vengeance, and feel ourselves every moment wreaking, in\nimagination, upon such violators of the laws of society, that punishment\nwhich our sympathetic indignation tells us is due to their crimes. Our\nsense of the horror and dreadful atrocity of such conduct, the delight\nwhich we take in hearing that it was properly punished, the indignation\nwhich we feel when it escapes this due retaliation, our whole sense and\nfeeling, in short, of its ill desert, of the propriety and fitness of\ninflicting evil upon the person who is guilty of it, and of making him\ngrieve in his turn, arises from the sympathetic indignation which\nnaturally boils up in the breast of the spectator, whenever he\nthoroughly brings home to himself the case of the sufferer[2].\nFootnote 2:\nTo ascribe in this manner our natural sense of the ill desert of human\nactions to a sympathy with the resentment of the sufferer, may seem,\nto the greater part of people, to be a degradation of that sentiment.\nResentment is commonly regarded as so odious a passion, that they will\nbe apt to think it impossible that so laudable a principle, as the\nsense of the ill desert of vice, should in any respect be founded upon\nit. They will be more willing, perhaps, to admit that our sense of the\nmerit of good actions is founded upon a sympathy with the gratitude of\nthe persons who receive the benefit of them; because gratitude, as\nwell as all the other benevolent passions, is regarded as an amiable\nprinciple, which can take nothing from the worth of whatever is\nfounded upon it. Gratitude and resentment, however, are in every\nrespect, it is evident, counterparts to one another; and if our sense\nof merit arises from a sympathy with the one, our sense of demerit can\nscarce miss to proceed from a fellow-feeling with the other.\nLet it be considered too that resentment, though, in the degrees in\nwhich we too often see it, the most odious, perhaps, of all the\npassions, is not disapproved of when properly humbled and entirely\nbrought down to the level of the sympathetic indignation of the\nspectator. When we, who are the bystanders, feel that our own\nanimosity entirely corresponds with that of the sufferer, when the\nresentment of this last does not in any respect go beyond our own,\nwhen no word, no gesture, escapes him that denotes an emotion more\nviolent than what we can keep time to, and when he never aims at\ninflicting any punishment beyond what we should rejoice to see\ninflicted, or what we ourselves would upon this account even desire to\nbe the instruments of inflicting, it is impossible that we should not\nentirely approve of his sentiments. Our own emotion in this case must,\nin our eyes, undoubtedly justify his. And as experience teaches us how\nmuch the greater part of mankind are incapable of this moderation, and\nhow great an effort must be made in order to bring down the rude and\nundisciplined impulse of resentment to this suitable temper, we cannot\navoid conceiving a considerable degree of esteem and admiration for\none who appears capable of exerting so much self-command over one of\nthe most ungovernable passions of his nature. When indeed the\nanimosity of the sufferer exceeds, as it almost always does, what we\ncan go along with, as we cannot enter into it, we necessarily\ndisapprove of it. We even disapprove of it more than we should of an\nequal excess of almost any other passion derived from the imagination.\nAnd this too violent resentment, instead of carrying us along with it,\nbecomes itself the object of our resentment and indignation. We enter\ninto the opposite resentment of the person who is the object of this\nunjust emotion, and who is in danger of suffering from it. Revenge,\ntherefore, the excess of resentment, appears to be the most detestable\nof all the passions, and is the object of the horror and indignation\nof every body. And as in the way in which this passion commonly\ndiscovers itself among mankind, it is excessive a hundred times for\nonce that it is moderate, we are very apt to consider it as altogether\nodious and detestable, because in its most ordinary appearances it is\nso. Nature, however, even in the present depraved state of mankind,\ndoes not seem to have dealt so unkindly with us, as to have endowed us\nwith any principle which is wholly in every respect evil, or which, in\nno degree and in no direction, can be the proper object of praise and\napprobation. Upon some occasions we are sensible that this passion,\nwhich is generally too strong, may likewise be too weak. We sometimes\ncomplain that a particular person shows too little spirit, and has too\nlittle sense of the injuries that have been done to him; and we are as\nready to despise him for the defect, as to hate him for the excess of\nthis passion.\nThe inspired writers would not surely have talked so frequently or so\nstrongly of the wrath and anger of God, if they had regarded every\ndegree of those passions as vicious and evil, even in so weak and\nimperfect a creature as man.\nLet it be considered too, that the present inquiry is not concerning a\nmatter of right, if I may say so, but concerning a matter of fact. We\nare not at present examining upon what principles a perfect being\nwould approve of the punishment of bad actions; but upon what\nprinciples so weak and imperfect a creature as man actually and in\nfact approves of it. The principles which I have just now mentioned,\nit is evident, have a very great effect upon his sentiments; and it\nseems wisely ordered that it should be so. The very existence of\nsociety requires that unmerited and unprovoked malice should be\nrestrained by proper punishments; and consequently, that to inflict\nthose punishments should be regarded as a proper and laudable action.\nThough man, therefore, be naturally endowed with a desire of the\nwelfare and preservation of society, yet the Author of nature has not\nentrusted it to his reason to find out that a certain application of\npunishments is the proper means of attaining this end; but has endowed\nhim with an immediate and instinctive approbation of that very\napplication which is most proper to attain it. The \u0153conomy of nature\nis in this respect exactly of a piece with what it is upon many other\noccasions. With regard to all those ends which, upon account of their\npeculiar importance, may be regarded, if such an expression is\nallowable, as the favourite ends of nature, she has constantly in this\nmanner not only endowed mankind with an appetite for the end which she\nproposes, but likewise with an appetite for the means by which alone\nthis end can be brought about, for their own sakes, and independent of\ntheir tendency to produce it. Thus self-preservation, and the\npropagation of the species, are the great ends which Nature seems to\nhave proposed in the formation of all animals. Mankind are endowed\nwith a desire of those ends, and an aversion to the contrary; with a\nlove of life, and a dread of dissolution; with a desire of the\ncontinuance and perpetuity of the species, and with an aversion to the\nthoughts of its entire extinction. But though we are in this manner\nendowed with a very strong desire of those ends, it has not been\nentrusted to the slow and uncertain determinations of our reason, to\nfind out the proper means of bringing them about. Nature has directed\nus to the greater part of these by original and immediate instincts.\nHunger, thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, the love of\npleasure, and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for\ntheir own sakes, and without any consideration of their tendency to\nthose beneficent ends which the great Director of nature intended to\nproduce by them.\nBefore I conclude this note, I must take notice of a difference\nbetween the approbation of propriety and that of merit or beneficence.\nBefore we approve of the sentiments of any person as proper and\nsuitable to their objects, we must not only be affected in the same\nmanner as he is, but we must perceive this harmony and correspondence\nof sentiments between him and ourselves. Thus, though upon hearing of\na misfortune that had befallen my friend, I should conceive precisely\nthat degree of concern which he gives way to; yet till I am informed\nof the manner in which he behaves, till I perceive the harmony between\nhis emotions and mine, I cannot be said to approve of the sentiments\nwhich influence his behaviour. The approbation of propriety therefore\nrequires, not only that we should intirely sympathize with the person\nwho acts, but that we should perceive this perfect concord between his\nsentiments and our own. On the contrary, when I hear of a benefit that\nhas been bestowed upon another person, let him who has received it be\naffected in what manner he pleases, if, by bringing his case home to\nmyself, I feel gratitude arise in my own breast, I necessarily approve\nof the conduct of his benefactor, and regard it as meritorious, and\nthe proper object of reward. Whether the person who has received the\nbenefit conceives gratitude or not, cannot, it is evident, in any\ndegree alter our sentiments with regard to the merit of him who has\nbestowed it. No actual correspondence of sentiments, therefore, is\nhere required. It is sufficient that if he was grateful, they would\ncorrespond; and our sense of merit is often founded upon one of those\nillusive sympathies, by which, when we bring home to ourselves the\ncase of another, we are often affected in a manner in which the person\nprincipally concerned is incapable of being affected. There is a\nsimilar difference between our disapprobation of demerit, and that of\nimpropriety.\nSECTION II.\nOf justice and beneficence.\nCHAP. I.\n_Comparison of those two virtues._\nActions of a beneficent tendency, which proceed from proper motives,\nseem alone to require reward; because such alone are the approved\nobjects of gratitude, or excite the sympathetic gratitude of the\nspectator.\nActions of a hurtful tendency, which proceed from improper motives, seem\nalone to deserve punishment; because such alone are the approved objects\nof resentment, or excite the sympathetic resentment of the spectator.\nBeneficence is always free, it cannot be extorted by force, the mere\nwant of it exposes to no punishment; because the mere want of\nbeneficence tends to do no real positive evil. It may disappoint of the\ngood which might reasonably have been expected, and upon that account it\nmay justly excite dislike and disapprobation: it cannot, however,\nprovoke any resentment which mankind will go along with. The man who\ndoes not recompense his benefactor, when he has it in his power, and\nwhen his benefactor needs his assistance, is, no doubt, guilty of the\nblackest ingratitude. The heart of every impartial spectator rejects all\nfellow-feeling with the selfishness of his motives, and he is the proper\nobject of the highest disapprobation. But still he does no positive hurt\nto any body. He only does not do that good which in propriety he ought\nto have done. He is the object of hatred, a passion which is naturally\nexcited by impropriety of sentiment and behaviour; not of resentment, a\npassion which is never properly called forth but by actions which tend\nto do real and positive hurt to some particular persons. His want of\ngratitude, therefore, cannot be punished. To oblige him by force to\nperform what in gratitude he ought to perform, and what every impartial\nspectator would approve of him for performing, would if possible, be\nstill more improper than his neglecting to perform it. His benefactor\nwould dishonour himself if he attempted by violence to constrain him to\ngratitude, and it would be impertinent for any third person, who was not\nthe superior of either, to intermeddle. But of all the duties of\nbeneficence, those which gratitude recommends to us approach nearest to\nwhat is called a perfect and complete obligation. What friendship, what\ngenerosity, what charity, would prompt us to do with universal\napprobation, is still more free, and can still less be extorted by force\nthan the duties of gratitude. We talk of the debt of gratitude, not of\ncharity, or generosity, nor even of friendship, when friendship is mere\nesteem, and has not been enhanced and complicated with gratitude for\ngood offices.\nResentment seems to have been given us by nature for defence, and for\ndefence only. It is the safeguard of justice and the security of\ninnocence. It prompts us to beat off the mischief which is attempted to\nbe done to us, and to retaliate that which is already done; that the\noffender may be made to repent of his injustice, and that others,\nthrough fear of the like punishment, may be terrified from being guilty\nof the like offence. It must be reserved therefore for these purposes,\nnor can the spectator ever go along with it when it is exerted for any\nother. But the mere want of the beneficent virtues, though it may\ndisappoint us of the good which might reasonably be expected, neither\ndoes, nor attempts to do, any mischief from which we can have occasion\nto defend ourselves.\nThere is however another virtue, of which the observance is not left to\nthe freedom of our own wills, which may be extorted by force, and of\nwhich the violation exposes to resentment, and consequently to\npunishment. This virtue is justice: the violation of justice is injury:\nit does real and positive hurt to some particular persons, from motives\nwhich are naturally disapproved of. It is, therefore, the proper object\nof resentment, and of punishment, which is the natural consequence of\nresentment. As mankind go along with, and approve of, the violence\nemployed to avenge the hurt which is done by injustice, so they much\nmore go along with, and approve of, that which is employed to prevent\nand beat off the injury, and to restrain the offender from hurting his\nneighbours. The person himself who meditates an injustice is sensible of\nthis, and feels that force may, with the utmost propriety, be made use\nof, both by the person whom he is about to injure, and by others, either\nto obstruct the execution of his crime, or to punish him when he has\nexecuted it. And upon this is founded that remarkable distinction\nbetween justice and all the other social virtues, which has of late been\nparticularly insisted upon by an author of very great and original\ngenius, that we feel ourselves to be under a stricter obligation to act\naccording to justice, than agreeably to friendship, charity, or\ngenerosity; that the practice of these last mentioned virtues seems to\nbe left in some measure to our own choice, but that, somehow or other,\nwe feel ourselves to be in a peculiar manner tied, bound, and obliged to\nthe observation of justice. We feel, that is to say, that force may,\nwith the utmost propriety and with the approbation of all mankind, be\nmade use of to constrain us to observe the rules of the one, but not to\nfollow the precepts of the other.\nWe must always, however, carefully distinguish what is only blamable, or\nthe proper object of disapprobation, from what force may be employed\neither to punish or to prevent. That seems blamable which falls short of\nthat ordinary degree of proper beneficence which experience teaches us\nto expect of every body; and on the contrary, that seems praise-worthy\nwhich goes beyond it. The ordinary degree itself, seems neither blamable\nnor praise-worthy. A father, a son, a brother, who behaves to the\ncorrespondent relation, neither better nor worse than the greater part\nof men commonly do, seems properly to deserve neither praise nor blame.\nHe who surprises us by extraordinary and unexpected, though still proper\nand suitable kindness, or on the contrary, by extraordinary and\nunexpected, as well as unsuitable unkindness, seems praise-worthy in the\none case, and blamable in the other.\nEven the most ordinary degree of kindness or beneficence, however,\ncannot, among equals, be extorted by force. Among equals each individual\nis naturally, and antecedent to the institution of civil government,\nregarded as having a right both to defend himself from injuries, and to\nexact a certain degree of punishment for those which have been done to\nhim. Every generous spectator not only approves of his conduct when he\ndoes this, but enters so far into his sentiments as often to be willing\nto assist him. When one man attacks, or robs, or attempts to murder\nanother, all the neighbours take the alarm, and think that they do right\nwhen they run, either to revenge the person who has been injured, or to\ndefend him who is in danger of being so. But when a father fails in the\nordinary degree of parental affection towards a son, when a son seems to\nwant that filial reverence which might be expected to his father; when\nbrothers are without the usual degree of brotherly affection; when a man\nshuts his breast against compassion, and refuses to relieve the misery\nof his fellow-creatures, when he can with the greatest ease; in all\nthese cases, though every body blames the conduct, nobody imagines that\nthose who might have reason, perhaps, to expect more kindness, have any\nright to extort it by force. The sufferer can only complain, and the\nspectator can intermeddle no other way than by advice and persuasion.\nUpon all such occasions, for equals to use force against one another,\nwould be thought the highest degree of insolence and presumption.\nA superior may, indeed, sometimes, with universal approbation, oblige\nthose under his jurisdiction to behave, in this respect, with a certain\ndegree of propriety to one another. The laws of all civilized nations\noblige parents to maintain their children, and children to maintain\ntheir parents, and impose upon men many other duties of beneficence. The\ncivil magistrate is entrusted with the power not only of preserving the\npublic peace by retraining injustice, but of promoting the prosperity of\nthe commonwealth, by establishing good discipline, and by discouraging\nevery sort of vice and impropriety; he may prescribe rules, therefore,\nwhich not only prohibit mutual injuries among fellow-citizens, but\ncommand mutual good offices to a certain degree. When the sovereign\ncommands what is merely indifferent, and what, antecedent to his orders,\nmight have been omitted without any blame, it becomes not only blamable\nbut punishable to disobey him. When he commands, therefore, what,\nantecedent to any such order, could not have been omitted without the\ngreatest blame, it surely becomes much more punishable to be wanting in\nobedience. Of all the duties of a law-giver, however, this, perhaps, is\nthat which it requires the greatest delicacy and reserve to execute with\npropriety and judgment. To neglect it altogether exposes the\ncommonwealth to many gross disorders and shocking enormities, and to\npush it too far is destructive of all liberty, security, and justice.\nThough the mere want of beneficence seems to merit no punishment from\nequals, the greater exertions of that virtue appear to deserve the\nhighest reward. By being productive of the greatest good, they are the\nnatural and approved objects of the liveliest gratitude. Though the\nbreach of justice, on the contrary, exposes to punishment, the\nobservance of the rules of that virtue seems scarce to deserve any\nreward. There is, no doubt, a propriety in the practice of justice, and\nit merits, upon that account, all the approbation which is due to\npropriety. But as it does no real positive good, it is entitled to very\nlittle gratitude. Mere justice is, upon most occasions, but a negative\nvirtue, and only hinders us from hurting our neighbour. The man who\nbarely abstains from violating either the person, or the estate, or the\nreputation of his neighbours, has surely very little positive merit. He\nfulfils, however, all the rules of what is peculiarly called justice,\nand does everything which his equals can with propriety force him to do,\nor which they can punish him for not doing. We may often fulfil all the\nrules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing.\nAs every man doth, so shall it be done to him, and retaliation seems to\nbe the great law which is dictated to us by Nature. Beneficence and\ngenerosity we think due to the generous and beneficent. Those whose\nhearts never open to the feelings of humanity, should, we think, be shut\nout in the same manner, from the affections of all their\nfellow-creatures, and be allowed to live in the midst of society, as in\na great desert where there is nobody to care for them, or to inquire\nafter them. The violator of the laws of justice ought to be made to feel\nhimself that evil which he has done to another; and since no regard to\nthe sufferings of his brethren are capable of restraining him, he ought\nto be over-awed by the fear of his own. The man who is barely innocent,\nwho only observes the law of justice with regard to others, and merely\nabstains from hurting his neighbours, can merit only that his neighbours\nin their turn should respect his innocence, and that the same laws\nshould be religiously observed with regard to him.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of the sense of justice, of remorse, and of the consciousness of\nmerit._\nThere can be no proper motive for hurting our neighbour, there can be no\nincitement to do evil to another, which mankind will go along with,\nexcept just indignation for evil which that other has done to us. To\ndisturb his happiness merely because it stands in the way of our own, to\ntake from him what is of real use to him merely because it may be of\nequal or more use to us, or to indulge, in this manner, at the expence\nof other people, the natural preference which every man has for his own\nhappiness above that of other people, is what no impartial spectator can\ngo along with. Every man is, no doubt, by nature, first and principally\nrecommended to his own care; and as he is fitter to take care of himself\nthan of any other person, it is fit and right that it should be so.\nEvery man, therefore, is much more deeply interested in whatever\nimmediately concerns himself, than in what concerns any other man: and\nto hear, perhaps, of the death of another person, with whom we have no\nparticular connexion, will give us less concern, will spoil our stomach,\nor break our rest much less than a very insignificant disaster which has\nbefallen ourselves. But though the ruin of our neighbour may affect us\nmuch less than a very small misfortune of our own, we must not ruin him\nto prevent that small misfortune, nor even to prevent our own ruin. We\nmust, here, as in all other cases, view ourselves not so much according\nto that light in which we may naturally appear to ourselves, as\naccording to that in which we naturally appear to others. Though every\nman may, according to the proverb, be the whole world to himself, to the\nrest of mankind he is a most insignificant part of it. Though his own\nhappiness may be of more importance to him than that of all the world\nbesides, to every other person it is of no more consequence than that of\nany other man. Though it may be true, therefore, that every individual,\nin his own breast, naturally prefers himself to all mankind, yet he\ndares not look mankind in the face, and avow that he acts according to\nthis principle. He feels that in this preference they can never go along\nwith him, and that how natural soever it may be to him, it must always\nappear excessive and extravagant to them. When he views himself in the\nlight in which he is conscious that others will view him, he sees that\nto them he is but one of the multitude in no respect better than any\nother in it. If he would act so as that the impartial spectator may\nenter into the principles of his conduct, which is what of all things he\nhas the greatest desire to do, he must, upon this, as upon all other\noccasions, humble the arrogance of his self-love, and bring it down to\nsomething which other men can go along with. They will indulge it so far\nas to allow him to be more anxious about, and to pursue with more\nearnest assiduity, his own happiness than that of any other person. Thus\nfar, whenever they place themselves in his situation, they will readily\ngo along with him. In the race for wealth and honours, and preferments,\nhe may run as hard as he can, and strain every nerve and every muscle,\nin order to outstrip all his competitors. But if he should justle, or\nthrow down any of them, the indulgence of the spectators is entirely at\nan end. It is a violation of fair play, which they cannot admit of. This\nman is to them, in every respect, as good as he: they do not enter into\nthat self-love by which he prefers himself so much to this other, and\ncannot go along with the motive from which he hurt him. They readily,\ntherefore, sympathize with the natural resentment of the injured, and\nthe offender becomes the object of their hatred and indignation. He is\nsensible that he becomes so, and feels that those sentiments are ready\nto burst out from all sides against him.\nAs the greater and more irreparable the evil that is done, the\nresentment of the sufferer runs naturally the higher, so does likewise\nthe sympathetic indignation of the spectator, as well as the sense of\nguilt in the agent. Death is the greatest evil which one man can inflict\nupon another, and excites the highest degree of resentment in those who\nare immediately connected with the slain. Murder, therefore, is the most\natrocious of all crimes which affect individuals only, in the sight both\nof mankind, and of the person who has committed it. To be deprived of\nthat which we are possessed of, is a greater evil than to be\ndisappointed of what we have only the expectation. Breach of property,\ntherefore, theft and robbery, which take from us what we are possessed\nof, are greater crimes than breach of contract, which only disappoints\nus of what we expected. The most sacred laws of justice, therefore,\nthose whose violation seems to call the loudest for vengeance and\npunishment, are the laws which guard the life and person of our\nneighbour; the next are those which guard his property and possessions;\nand last of all come those which guard what are called his personal\nrights, or what is due to him from the promises of others.\nThe violator of the more sacred laws of justice can never reflect on the\nsentiments which mankind must entertain with regard to him, without\nfeeling all the agonies of shame, and horror, and consternation. When\nhis passion is gratified, and he begins coolly to reflect upon his\nconduct, he can enter into none of the motives which influenced it. They\nappear now as detestable to him as they did always to other people. By\nsympathizing with the hatred and abhorrence which other men must\nentertain for him, he becomes in some measure the object of his own\nhatred and abhorrence. The situation of the person, who suffered by his\ninjustice, now calls upon his pity. He is grieved at the thought of it;\nregrets the unhappy effects of his own conduct, and feels at the same\ntime that they have rendered him the proper object of the resentment and\nindignation of mankind, and of what is the natural consequence of\nresentment, vengeance and punishment. The thought of this perpetually\nhaunts him, and fills him with terror and amazement. He dares no longer\nlook society in the face, but imagines himself as it were rejected, and\nthrown out from the affections of all mankind. He cannot hope for the\nconsolation of sympathy in this his greatest, and most dreadful\ndistress. The remembrance of his crimes has shut out all fellow-feelings\nwith him from the hearts of his fellow-creatures. The sentiments which\nthey entertain with regard to him, are the very thing which he is most\nafraid of. Every thing seems hostile, and he would be glad to fly to\nsome inhospitable desert, where he might never more behold the face of a\nhuman creature, nor read in the countenance of mankind the condemnation\nof his crimes. But solitude is still more dreadful than society. His own\nthoughts can present him with nothing but what is black, unfortunate,\nand disastrous, the melancholy forebodings of incomprehensible misery\nand ruin. The horror of solitude drives him back into society, and he\ncomes again into the presence of mankind, astonished to appear before\nthem, loaded with shame and distracted with fear, in order to supplicate\nsome little protection from the countenance of those very judges, who he\nknows have already all unanimously condemned him. Such is the nature of\nthat sentiment, which is properly called remorse; of all the sentiments\nwhich can enter the human breast the most dreadful. It is made up of\nshame from the sense of the impropriety of past conduct; of grief for\nthe effects of it; of pity for those who suffer by it; and of the dread\nand terror of punishment from the consciousness of the justly provoked\nresentment of all rational creatures.\nThe opposite behaviour naturally inspires the opposite sentiment. The\nman who, not from frivolous fancy, but from proper motives, has\nperformed a generous action, when he looks forward to those whom he has\nserved, feels himself to be the natural object of their love and\ngratitude, and, by sympathy with them, of the esteem and approbation of\nall mankind. And when he looks backward to the motive from which he\nacted, and surveys it in the light in which the indifferent spectator\nwill survey it, he still continues to enter into it, and applauds\nhimself by sympathy with the approbation of this supposed impartial\njudge. In both these points of view his own conduct appears to him every\nway agreeable. His mind, at the thought of it, is filled with\nchearfulness, serenity, and composure. He is in friendship and harmony\nwith all mankind, and looks upon his fellow-creatures with confidence\nand benevolent satisfaction, secure that he has rendered himself worthy\nof their most favourable regards. In the combination of all these\nsentiments consists the consciousness of merit, or of deserved reward.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of the utility of this constitution of nature._\nIt is thus that man, who can subsist only in society, was fitted by\nnature to that situation for which he was made. All the members of human\nsociety stand in need of each others assistance, and are likewise\nexposed to mutual injuries. Where the necessary assistance is\nreciprocally afforded from love, from gratitude, from friendship and\nesteem, the society flourishes and is happy. All the different members\nof it are bound together by the agreeable bands of love and affection,\nand are, as it were, drawn to one common centre of mutual good offices.\nBut though the necessary assistance should not be afforded from such\ngenerous and disinterested motives, though among the different members\nof the society there should be no mutual love and affection, the\nsociety, though less happy and agreeable, will not necessarily be\ndissolved. Society may subsist among different men, as among different\nmerchants, from a sense of its utility, without any mutual love or\naffection; and though no man in it should owe any obligation, or be\nbound in gratitude to any other, it may still be upheld by a mercenary\nexchange of good offices according to an agreed valuation.\nSociety, however, cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready\nto hurt and injure one another. The moment that injury begins, the\nmoment that mutual resentment and animosity take place, all the bands of\nit are broke asunder, and the different members of which it consisted\nare, as it were, dissipated and scattered abroad by the violence and\nopposition of their discordant affections. If there is any society among\nrobbers and murderers, they must at least, according to the trite\nobservation, abstain from robbing and murdering one another.\nBeneficence, therefore, is less essential to the exigence of society\nthan justice. Society may subsist, though not in the most comfortable\nstate, without beneficence; but the prevalence of injustice must utterly\ndestroy it.\nThough Nature, therefore, exhorts mankind to acts of beneficence, by the\npleasing consciousness of deserved reward, she has not thought it\nnecessary to guard and enforce the practice of it by the terrors of\nmerited punishment in case it should be neglected. It is the ornament\nwhich embellishes, not the foundation which supports the building, and\nwhich it was, therefore, sufficient to recommend, but by no means\nnecessary to impose. Justice, on the contrary, is the main pillar that\nupholds the whole edifice. If it is removed, the great, the immense\nfabric of human society, that fabric which to raise and support seems in\nthis world, if I may say so, to have been the peculiar and darling care\nof Nature, must in a moment crumble into atoms. In order to enforce the\nobservation of justice, therefore, Nature has implanted in the human\nbreast that consciousness of ill desert, those terrors of merited\npunishment which attend upon its violation, as the great safe-guards of\nthe association of mankind, to protect the weak, to curb the violent,\nand to chastise the guilty. Men, though naturally sympathetic, feel so\nlittle for another, with whom they have no particular connexion, in\ncomparison for what they feel for themselves; the misery of one, who is\nmerely their fellow-creature, is of so little importance to them in\ncomparison even of a small conveniency of their own; they have it so\nmuch in their power to hurt him, and may have so many temptations to do\nso, that if this principle did not stand up within them in his defence,\nand overawe them into a respect for his innocence, they would, like wild\nbeasts, be at all times ready to fly upon him; and a man would enter an\nassembly of men as he enters a den of lions.\nIn every part of the universe we observe means adjusted with the nicest\nartifice to the ends which they are intended to produce; and in the\nmechanism of a plant, or animal body, admire how every thing is\ncontrived for advancing the two great purposes of nature, the support of\nthe individual, and the propagation of the species. But in these, and in\nall such objects, we still distinguish the efficient from the final\ncause of their several motions and organizations. The digestion of the\nfood, the circulation of the blood, and the secretion of the several\njuices which are drawn from it, are operations all of them necessary for\nthe great purposes of animal life. Yet we never endeavour to account for\nthem from those purposes as from their efficient causes, nor imagine\nthat the blood circulates, or that the food digests of its own accord,\nand with a view or intention to the purposes of circulation or\ndigestion. The wheels of the watch are all admirably adjusted to the end\nfor which it was made, the pointing of the hour. All their various\nmotions conspire in the nicest manner to produce this effect. If they\nwere endowed with a desire and intention to produce it, they could not\ndo it better. Yet we never ascribe any such desire or intention to them,\nbut to the watch-maker, and we know that they are put in motion by a\nspring, which intends the effect it produces as little as they do. But\nthough, in accounting for the operations of bodies, we never fail to\ndistinguish in this manner the efficient from the final cause, in\naccounting for those of the mind, we are very apt to confound those two\ndifferent things with one another. When by natural principles we are led\nto advance those ends, which a refined and enlightened reason should\nrecommend to us, we are very apt to impute to that reason, as to their\nefficient cause, the sentiments and actions by which we advance those\nends, and to imagine that to be the wisdom of man, which in reality is\nthe wisdom of God. Upon a superficial view this cause seems sufficient\nto produce the effects which are ascribed to it; and the system of human\nnature seems to be more simple and agreeable when all its different\noperations are in this manner deduced from a single principle.\nAs society cannot subsist unless the laws of justice are totally\nobserved, as no social intercourse can take place among men who do not\ngenerally abstain from injuring one another; the consideration of this\nnecessity, it has been thought, was the ground upon which we approved of\nthe enforcement of the laws of justice by the punishment of those who\nviolated them. Man, it has been said, has a natural love for society,\nand desires that the union of mankind should be preserved for its own\nsake, and though he himself was to derive no benefit from it. The\norderly and flourishing state of society is agreeable to him, and he\ntakes delight in contemplating it. Its disorder and confusion, on the\ncontrary, is the object of his aversion, and he is chagrined at whatever\ntends to produce it. He is sensible too that his own interest is\nconnected with the prosperity of society, and that the happiness,\nperhaps the preservation of his existence, depends upon its\npreservation. Upon every account, therefore, he has an abhorrence at\nwhatever can tend to destroy society, and is willing to make use of\nevery means, which can hinder so hated and so dreadful an event.\nInjustice necessarily tends to destroy it. Every appearance of\ninjustice, therefore, alarms him, and he runs, if I may say so, to stop\nthe progress of what, if allowed to go on, would quickly put an end to\nevery thing that is dear to him. If he cannot restrain it by gentle and\nfair means, he must bear it down by force and violence, and at any rate\nmust put a stop to its further progress. Hence it is, they say, that he\noften approves of the enforcement of the law of justice even by the\ncapital punishment of those who violate them. The disturber of the\npublic peace is hereby removed out of the world, and others are\nterrified by his fate from imitating his example.\nSuch is the account commonly given of our approbation of the punishment\nof injustice. And so far this account is undoubtedly true, that we\nfrequently have occasion to confirm our natural sense of the propriety\nand fitness of punishment, by reflecting how necessary it is for\npreserving the order of society. When the guilty is about to suffer that\njust retaliation, which the natural indignation of mankind tells them is\ndue to his crimes; when the insolence of his injustice is broken and\nhumbled by the terror of his approaching punishment; when he ceases to\nbe an object of fear, with the generous and humane he begins to be an\nobject of pity. The thought of what he is about to suffer extinguishes\ntheir resentment for the sufferings of others to which he has given\noccasion. They are disposed to pardon and forgive him, and to save him\nfrom that punishment, which in all their cool hours they had considered\nas the retribution due to such crimes. Here, therefore, they have\noccasion to call to their assistance the consideration of the general\ninterest of society. They counterbalance the impulse of this weak and\npartial humanity by the dictates of a humanity that is more generous and\ncomprehensive. They reflect that mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the\ninnocent, and oppose to the emotions of compassion which they feel for a\nparticular person, a more enlarged compassion which they feel for\nmankind.\nSometimes too we have occasion to defend the propriety of observing the\ngeneral rules of justice by the consideration of their necessity to the\nsupport of society. We frequently hear the young and the licentious\nridiculing the most sacred rules of morality, and professing, sometimes\nfrom the corruption, but more frequently from the vanity of their\nhearts, the most abominable maxims of conduct. Our indignation rouses,\nand we are eager to refute and expose such detestable principles. But\nthough it is their intrinsic hatefulness and detestableness, which\noriginally inflames us against them, we are unwilling to assign this as\nthe sole reason why we condemn them, or to pretend that it is merely\nbecause we ourselves hate and detest them. The reason, we think, would\nnot appear to be conclusive. Yet why should it not; if we hate and\ndetest them because they are the natural and proper objects of hatred\nand detestation? But when we are asked why we should not act in such or\nsuch a manner, the very question seems to suppose that, to those who ask\nit, this manner of acting does not appear to be for its own sake the\nnatural and proper object of those sentiments. We must show them,\ntherefore, that it ought to be so for the sake of something else. Upon\nthis account we generally cast about for other arguments, and the\nconsideration which first occurs to us is the disorder and confusion of\nsociety which would result from the universal prevalence of such\npractices. We seldom fail, therefore, to insist upon this topic.\nBut though it commonly requires no great discernment to see the\ndestructive tendency of all licentious practices to the welfare of\nsociety, it is seldom this consideration which first animates us against\nthem. All men, even the most stupid and unthinking, abhor fraud,\nperfidy, and injustice, and delight to see them punished. But few men\nhave reflected upon the necessity of justice to the existence of\nsociety, how obvious soever that necessity may appear to be.\nThat it is not a regard to the preservation of society, which originally\ninterests us in the punishment of crimes committed against individuals,\nmay be demonstrated by many obvious considerations. The concern which we\ntake in the fortune and happiness of individuals does not, in common\ncases, arise from that which we take in the fortune and happiness of\nsociety. We are no more concerned for the destruction or loss of a\nsingle man, because this man is a member or part of society, and because\nwe should be concerned for the destruction of society, than we are\nconcerned for the loss of a single guinea, because this guinea is a part\nof a thousand guineas, and because we should be concerned for the loss\nof the whole sum. In neither case does our regard for the individuals\narise from our regard for the multitude: but in both cases our regard\nfor the multitude is compounded and made up of the particular regards\nwhich we feel for the different individuals of which it is composed. As\nwhen a small sum is unjustly taken from us we do not so much prosecute\nthe injury from a regard to the preservation of our whole fortune, as\nfrom a regard to that particular sum which we have lost; so when a\nsingle man is injured or destroyed, we demand the punishment of the\nwrong that has been done to him, not so much from a concern for the\ngeneral interest of society, as from a concern for that very individual\nwho has been injured. It is to be observed, however, that this concern\ndoes not necessarily include in it any degree of those exquisite\nsentiments which are commonly called love, esteem, and affection, and by\nwhich we distinguish our particular friends and acquaintance. The\nconcern which is requisite for this is no more than the general\nfellow-feeling which we have with every man merely because he is our\nfellow-creature. We enter into the resentment even of an odious person,\nwhen he is injured by those to whom he has given no provocation. Our\ndisapprobation of his ordinary character and conduct, does not in this\ncase altogether prevent our fellow-feeling with his natural indignation;\nthough with those who are not either extremely candid, or who have not\nbeen accustomed to correct and regulate their natural sentiments by\ngeneral rules, it is very apt to damp it.\nUpon some occasions, indeed, we both punish and approve of punishment,\nmerely from a view to the general interest of society, which, we\nimagine, cannot otherwise be secured. Of this kind are all the\npunishments inflicted for breaches of what is called either civil\npolice, or military discipline. Such crimes do not immediately or\ndirectly hurt any particular person; but their remote consequences, it\nis supposed, do produce, or might produce, either a considerable\ninconveniency, or a great disorder in the society. A centinel, for\nexample, who falls asleep upon his watch, suffers death by the law of\nwar, because such carelessness might endanger the whole army. This\nseverity may, upon many occasions, appear necessary, and, for that\nreason, just and proper. When the preservation of an individual is\ninconsistent with the safety of a multitude, nothing can be more just\nthan that the many should be preferred to the one. Yet this punishment,\nhow necessary soever, always appears to be excessively severe. The\nnatural atrocity of the crime seems to be so little, and the punishment\nso great, that it is with great difficulty that our hearts can reconcile\nitself to it. Though such carelessness appears very blamable, yet the\nthought of this crime does not naturally excite any such resentment, as\nwould prompt us to take such dreadful revenge. A man of humanity must\nrecollect himself, must make an effort, and exert his whole firmness and\nresolution, before he can bring himself either to inflict it, or to go\nalong with it when it is inflicted by others. It is not, however, in\nthis manner, that he looks upon the just punishment of an ungrateful\nmurderer or parricide. His heart, in this case, applauds with ardour,\nand even with transport, the just retaliation which seems due to such\ndetestable crimes, and which, if, by any accident, they should happen to\nescape, he would be highly enraged and disappointed. The very different\nsentiment with which the spectator views those different punishments, is\na proof that his approbation of the one is far from being founded upon\nthe same principles with that of the other. He looks upon the centinel\nas an unfortunate victim, who, indeed, must, and ought to be, devoted to\nthe safety of numbers, but whom still, in his heart, he would be glad to\nsave; and he is only sorry, that the interest of the many should oppose\nit. But if the murderer should escape from punishment, it would excite\nhis highest indignation, and he would call upon God to avenge, in\nanother world, that crime which the injustice of mankind had neglected\nto chastise upon earth.\nFor it well deserves to be taken notice of, that we are so far from\nimagining that injustice ought to be punished in this life, merely on\naccount of the order of society, which cannot otherwise be maintained,\nthat Nature teaches us to hope, and religion, we suppose, authorizes us\nto expect, that it will be punished, even in a life to come. Our sense\nof its ill desert pursues it, if I may say so, even beyond the grave,\nthough the example of its punishment there cannot serve to deter the\nrest of mankind, who see it not, who know it not, from being guilty of\nthe like practices here. The justice of God, however, we think, still\nrequires, that he should hereafter avenge the injuries of the widow and\nthe fatherless, who are here so often insulted with impunity.\nThat the Deity loves virtue and hates vice, as a voluptuous man loves\nriches and hates poverty, not for their own sakes, but for the effects\nwhich they tend to produce; that he loves the one, only because it\npromotes the happiness of society, which his benevolence prompts him to\ndesire; and that he hates the other, only because it occasions the\nmisery of mankind, which the same divine quality renders the object of\nhis aversion; is not the doctrine of untaught nature, but of an\nartificial refinement of reason and philosophy. Our untaught, natural\nsentiments, all prompt us to believe, that as perfect virtue is supposed\nnecessarily to appear to the Deity, as it does to us, for its own sake,\nand without any further view, the natural and proper object of love and\nreward, so must vice, of hatred and punishment. That the gods neither\nresent nor hurt, was the general maxim of all the different sects of the\nancient philosophy: and if, by resenting, be understood, that violent\nand disorderly perturbation, which often distracts and confounds the\nhuman breast; or if, by hurting, be understood, the doing mischief\nwantonly, and without regard to propriety or justice, such weakness is\nundoubtedly unworthy of the divine perfection. But if it be meant, that\nvice does not appear to the Deity to be, for its own sake, the object of\nabhorrence and aversion, and what, for its own sake, it is fit and right\nshould be punished, the truth of this maxim seems repugnant to some very\nnatural feelings. If we consult our natural sentiments, we are even apt\nto fear, lest, before the holiness of God, vice should appear to be more\nworthy of punishment than the weakness and imperfection of human virtue\ncan ever seem to be of reward. Man, when about to appear before a Being\nof infinite perfection, can feel but little confidence in his own merit,\nor in the imperfect propriety of his own conduct. In the presence of his\nfellow-creatures, he may even justly elevate himself, and may often have\nreason to think highly of his own character and conduct, compared to the\nstill greater imperfection of theirs. But the case is quite different\nwhen about to appear before his infinite Creator. To such a Being, he\nfears, that his littleness and weakness can scarce ever appear the\nproper object, either of esteem or of reward. But he can easily\nconceive, how the numberless violations of duty, of which he has been\nguilty, should render him the proper object of aversion and punishment;\nand he thinks he can see no reason why the divine indignation should not\nbe let loose without any restraint, upon so vile an insect, as he\nimagines that he himself must appear to be. If he would still hope for\nhappiness, he suspects that he cannot demand it from the justice, but\nthat he must entreat it from the mercy of God. Repentance, sorrow,\nhumility, contrition at the thought of his past conduct, seem, upon this\naccount, the sentiments which become him, and to be the only means which\nhe has left for appeasing that wrath which, he knows, he has justly\nprovoked. He even distrusts the efficacy of all these, and naturally\nfears, lest the wisdom of God should not, like the weakness of man, be\nprevailed upon to spare the crime by the most importunate lamentations\nof the criminal. Some other intercession, some other sacrifice, some\nother atonement, he imagines must be made for him, beyond what he\nhimself is capable of making, before the purity of the divine justice\ncan be reconciled to his manifold offences. The doctrines of revelation\ncoincide, in every respect, with those original anticipations of nature;\nand as they teach us how little we can depend upon the imperfection of\nour own virtue, so they show us, at the same time, that the most\npowerful intercession has been made, and that the most dreadful\natonement has been paid for our manifold transgressions and iniquities.\nSECTION III.\nOf the influence of fortune upon the sentiments of mankind, with regard\nto the merit or demerit of actions.\nINTRODUCTION.\nWhatever praise or blame can be due to any action, must belong either,\nfirst, to the intention or affection of the heart, from which it\nproceeds; or, secondly, to the external action or movement of the body,\nwhich this affection gives occasion to; or, last, to all the good or bad\nconsequences, which actually, and in fact, proceed from it. These three\ndifferent things constitute the whole nature and circumstances of the\naction, and must be the foundation of whatever quality can belong to it.\nThat the two last of these three circumstances cannot be the foundation\nof any praise or blame, is abundantly evident; nor has the contrary ever\nbeen asserted by any body. The external action or movement of the body\nis often the same in the most innocent and in the most blamable actions.\nHe who shoots a bird, and he who shoots a man, both of them perform the\nsame external movement: each of them draws the tricker of a gun. The\nconsequences which actually, and in fact, happen to proceed from any\naction, are, if possible, still more indifferent either to praise or\nblame, than even the external movement of the body. As they depend, not\nupon the agent, but upon fortune, they cannot be the proper foundation\nfor any sentiment, of which his character and conduct are the objects.\nThe only consequences for which he can be answerable, or by which he can\ndeserve either approbation or disapprobation of any kind, are those\nwhich were some way or other intended, or those which, at least, show\nsome agreeable or disagreeable quality in the intention of the heart,\nfrom which he acted. To the intention or affection of the heart,\ntherefore, to the propriety or impropriety, to the beneficence or\nhurtfulness of the design, all praise or blame, all approbation or\ndisapprobation, of any kind, which can justly be bestowed upon any\naction, must ultimately belong.\nWhen this maxim is thus proposed in abstract and general terms, there is\nno body who does not agree to it. Its self-evident justice is\nacknowledged by all the world, and there is not a dissenting voice among\nall mankind. Every body allows, that how different soever the\naccidental, the unintended and unforeseen consequences of different\nactions, yet, if the intentions or affections from which they arose\nwere, on the one hand, equally proper and equally beneficent, or, on the\nother, equally improper and equally malevolent, the merit or demerit of\nthe actions is still the same, and the agent is equally the suitable\nobject either of gratitude or of resentment.\nBut how well soever we may seem to be persuaded of the truth of this\nequitable maxim, when we consider it after this manner, in abstract, yet\nwhen we come to particular cases, the actual consequences which happen\nto proceed from any action, have a very great effect upon our sentiments\nconcerning its merit or demerit, and almost always either enhance or\ndiminish our sense of both. Scarce, in any one instance, perhaps, will\nour sentiments be found, after examination, to be entirely regulated by\nthis rule, which we all acknowledge ought entirely to regulate them.\nThis irregularity of sentiment, which every body feels, which scarce any\nbody is sufficiently aware of, and which no body is willing to\nacknowledge, I proceed now to explain; and I shall consider, first, the\ncause which gives occasion to it, or the mechanism by which nature\nproduces it; secondly, the extent of its influence; and, last of all,\nthe end which it answers, or the purpose which the Author of nature\nseems to have intended by it.\nCHAP. I.\n_Of the causes of this influence of fortune._\nThe causes of pain and pleasure, whatever they are, or however they\noperate, seem to be the objects, which, in all animals, immediately\nexcite those two passions of gratitude and resentment. They are excited\nby inanimated, as well as by animated objects. We are angry, for a\nmoment, even at the stone that hurts us. A child beats it, a dog barks\nat it, a choleric man is apt to curse it. The least reflection, indeed,\ncorrects this sentiment, and we soon become sensible, that what has no\nfeeling is a very improper object of revenge. When the mischief,\nhowever, is very great, the object which caused it becomes disagreeable\nto us ever after, and we take pleasure to burn or destroy it. We should\ntreat, in this manner, the instrument which had accidentally been the\ncause of the death of a friend, and we should often think ourselves\nguilty of a sort of inhumanity, if we neglected to vent this absurd sort\nof vengeance upon it.\nWe conceive, in the same manner, a sort of gratitude for those\ninanimated objects, which have been the causes of great, or frequent\npleasure to us. The sailor, who, as soon as he got ashore, should mend\nhis fire with the plank upon which he had just escaped from a shipwreck,\nwould seem to be guilty of an unnatural action. We should expect that he\nwould rather preserve it with care and affection, as a monument that\nwas, in some measure, dear to him. A man grows fond of a snuff-box, of a\npen-knife, of a staff which he has long made use of, and conceives\nsomething like a real love and affection for them. If he breaks or loses\nthem, he is vexed out of all proportion to the value of the damage. The\nhouse which we have long lived in, the tree, whose verdure and shade we\nhave long enjoyed, are both looked upon with a sort of respect that\nseems due to such benefactors. The decay of the one, or the ruin of the\nother, affects us with a kind of melancholy, though we should sustain no\nloss by it. The Dryads and the Lares of the ancients, a sort of genii of\ntrees and houses, were probably first suggested by this sort of\naffection, which the authors of those superstitions felt for such\nobjects, and which seemed unreasonable, if there was nothing animated\nabout them.\nBut, before any thing can be the proper object of gratitude or\nresentment, it must not only be the cause of pleasure or pain, it must\nlikewise be capable of feeling them. Without this other quality, those\npassions cannot vent themselves with any sort of satisfaction upon it.\nAs they are excited by the causes of pleasure and pain, so their\ngratification consists in retaliating those sensations upon what gave\noccasion to them; which it is to no purpose to attempt upon what has no\nsensibility. Animals, therefore, are less improper objects of gratitude\nand resentment than inanimated objects. The dog that bites, the ox that\ngores, are both of them punished. If they have been the causes of the\ndeath of any person, neither the public, nor the relations of the slain,\ncan be satisfied, unless they are put to death in their turn: nor is\nthis merely for the security of the living, but in some measure, to\nrevenge the injury of the dead. Those animals, on the contrary, that\nhave been remarkably serviceable to their masters, become the objects of\na very lively gratitude. We are shocked at the brutality of that\nofficer, mentioned in the Turkish Spy, who stabbed the horse that had\ncarried him a-cross an arm of the sea, lest that animal should\nafterwards distinguish some other person by a similar adventure.\nBut, though animals are not only the causes of pleasure and pain, but\nare also capable of feeling those sensations, they are still far from\nbeing complete and perfect objects, either of gratitude or resentment;\nand those passions still feel, that there is something wanting to their\nentire gratification. What gratitude chiefly desires, is not only to\nmake the benefactor feel pleasure in his turn, but to make him conscious\nthat he meets with this reward on account of his past conduct, to make\nhim pleased with that conduct, and to satisfy him that the person upon\nwhom he bestowed his good offices was not unworthy of them. What most of\nall charms us in our benefactor, is the concord between his sentiments\nand our own, with regard to what interests us so nearly as the worth of\nour own character, and the esteem that is due to us. We are delighted to\nfind a person who values us as well as we value ourselves, and\ndistinguishes us from the rest of mankind, with an attention not unlike\nthat with which we distinguish ourselves. To maintain in him these\nagreeable and flattering sentiments, is one of the chief ends proposed\nby the returns we are disposed to make to him. A generous mind often\ndisdains the interested thought of extorting new favours from its\nbenefactor, by what may be called the importunities of its gratitude.\nBut to preserve and to increase his esteem, is an interest which the\ngreatest mind does not think unworthy of its attention. And this is the\nfoundation of what I formerly observed, that when we cannot enter into\nthe motives of our benefactor, when his conduct and character appear\nunworthy of our approbation, let his services have been ever so great,\nour gratitude is always sensibly diminished. We are less flattered by\nthe distinction; and to preserve the esteem of so weak, or so worthless\na patron, seems to be an object which does not deserve to be pursued for\nits own sake.\nThe object, on the contrary, which resentment is chiefly intent upon, is\nnot so much to make our enemy feel pain in his turn, as to make him\nconscious that he feels it upon account of his past conduct, to make him\nrepent of that conduct, and to make him sensible, that the person whom\nhe injured did not deserve to be treated in that manner. What chiefly\nenrages us against the man who injures or insults us, is the little\naccount which he seems to make of us, the unreasonable preference which\nhe gives to himself above us, and that absurd self-love, by which he\nseems to imagine, that other people may be sacrificed at any time, to\nhis conveniency or his humour. The glaring impropriety of this conduct,\nthe gross insolence and injustice which it seems to involve in it, often\nshock and exasperate us more than all the mischief which we have\nsuffered. To bring him back to a more just sense of what is due to other\npeople, to make him sensible of what he owes us, and of the wrong that\nhe has done to us, is frequently the principal end proposed in our\nrevenge, which is always imperfect when it cannot accomplish this. When\nour enemy appears to have done us no injury, when we are sensible that\nhe acted quite properly, that, in his situation, we should have done the\nsame thing, and that we deserved from him all the mischief we met with;\nin that case, if we have the least spark either of candour or justice,\nwe can entertain no sort of resentment.\nBefore any thing, therefore, can be the complete and proper object,\neither of gratitude or resentment, it must possess three different\nqualifications. First, it must be the cause of pleasure in the one case,\nand of pain in the other. Secondly, it must be capable of feeling those\nsensations. And, thirdly, it must not only have produced those\nsensations, but it must have produced them from design, and from a\ndesign that is approved of in the one case, and disapproved of in the\nother. It is by the first qualification, that any object is capable of\nexciting those passions: it is by the second, that it is in any respect\ncapable of gratifying them: the third qualification is both necessary\nfor their complete satisfaction, and as it gives a pleasure or pain that\nis both exquisite and peculiar, it is likewise an additional exciting\ncause of those passions.\nAs what gives pleasure or pain, therefore, either in one way or another,\nis the sole exciting cause of gratitude and resentment; though the\nintentions of any person should be ever so proper and beneficent, on the\none hand, or ever so improper and malevolent on the other; yet, if he\nhas failed in producing either the good or evil which he intended, as\none of the exciting causes is wanting in both cases, less gratitude\nseems due to him in the one, and less resentment in the other. And, on\nthe contrary, though in the intentions of any person, there was either\nno laudable degree of benevolence on the one hand, or no blamable degree\nof malice on the other; yet, if his actions should produce either great\ngood or great evil, as one of the exciting causes takes place upon both\nthese occasions, some gratitude is apt to arise towards him in the one,\nand some resentment in the other. A shadow of merit seems to fall upon\nhim in the first, a shadow of demerit in the second. And, as the\nconsequences of actions are altogether under the empire of Fortune,\nhence arises her influence upon the sentiments of mankind, with regard\nto merit and demerit.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of the extent of this influence of fortune._\nThe effect of this influence of fortune is, first, to diminish our sense\nof the merit or demerit of those actions which arose from the most\nlaudable or blamable intentions, when they fail of producing their\nproposed effects: and, secondly, to increase our sense of the merit or\ndemerit of actions, beyond what is due to the motives or affections from\nwhich they proceed, when they accidentally give occasion either to\nextraordinary pleasure or pain.\n1. First, I say, though the intentions of any person should be ever so\nproper and beneficent, on the one hand, or ever so improper and\nmalevolent, on the other, yet, if they fail in producing their effects,\nhis merit seems imperfect in the one case, and his demerit incomplete in\nthe other. Nor is this irregularity of sentiment felt only by those who\nare immediately affected by the consequences of any action. It is felt,\nin some measure, even by the impartial spectator. The man who solicits\nan office for another, without obtaining it, is regarded as his friend,\nand seems to deserve his love and affection. But the man who not only\nsolicits, but procures it, is more peculiarly considered as his patron\nand benefactor, and is entitled to his respect and gratitude. The person\nobliged, we are apt to think, may with some justice, imagine himself on\na level with the first: but we cannot enter into his sentiments, if he\ndoes not feel himself inferior to the second. It is common indeed to\nsay, that we are equally obliged to the man who has endeavoured to serve\nus, as to him who actually did so. It is the speech which we constantly\nmake upon every unsuccessful attempt of this kind; but which, like all\nother fine speeches, must be understood with a grain of allowance. The\nsentiments which a man of generosity entertains for the friend who\nfails, may often indeed be nearly the same with those which he conceives\nfor him who succeeds: and the more generous he is, the more nearly will\nthose sentiments approach to an exact level. With the truly generous, to\nbe beloved, to be esteemed by those whom they themselves think worthy of\nesteem, gives more pleasure, and thereby excites more gratitude, than\nall the advantages which they can ever expect from those sentiments.\nWhen they lose those advantages therefore, they seem to lose but a\ntrifle, which is scarce worth regarding. They still however lose\nsomething. Their pleasure therefore, and consequently their gratitude,\nis not perfectly complete: and accordingly if, between the friend who\nfails and the friend who succeeds, all other circumstances are equal,\nthere will, even in the noblest and the best mind, be some little\ndifference of affection in favour of him who succeeds. Nay, so unjust\nare mankind in this respect, that though the intended benefit should be\nprocured, yet if it is not procured by the means of a particular\nbenefactor, they are apt to think that less gratitude is due to the man,\nwho with the best intentions in the world could do no more than help it\na little forward. As their gratitude is in this case divided among the\ndifferent persons who contributed to their pleasure, a smaller share of\nit seems due to any one. Such a person, we hear men commonly say,\nintended no doubt to serve us; and we really believe exerted himself to\nthe utmost of his abilities for that purpose. We are not, however,\nobliged to him for this benefit; since had it not been for the\nconcurrence of others, all that he could have done would never have\nbrought it about. This consideration, they imagine, should, even in the\neyes of the impartial spectator, diminish the debt which they owe to\nhim. The person himself who has unsuccessfully endeavoured to confer a\nbenefit, has by no means the same dependency upon the gratitude of the\nman whom he meant to oblige, nor the same sense of his own merit towards\nhim, which he would have had in the case of success.\nEven the merit of talents and abilities which some accident has hindered\nfrom producing their effects, seems in some measure imperfect, even to\nthose who are fully convinced of their capacity to produce them. The\ngeneral who has been hindered by the envy of ministers from gaining some\ngreat advantage over the enemies of his country, regrets the loss of the\nopportunity for ever after. Nor is it only upon account of the public\nthat he regrets it. He laments that he was hindered from performing an\naction which would have added a new lustre to his character in his own\neyes, as well as in those of every other person. It satisfies neither\nhimself nor others to reflect that the plan or design was all that\ndepended on him, that no greater capacity was required to execute it\nthan what was necessary to concert it: that he was allowed to be every\nway capable of executing it, and that had he been permitted to go on,\nsuccess was infallible. He still did not execute it; and though he might\ndeserve all the approbation which is due to a magnanimous and great\ndesign, he still wanted the actual merit of having performed a great\naction. To take the management of any affair of public concern from the\nman who has almost brought it to a conclusion, is regarded as the most\ninvidious injustice. As he had done so much, he should, we think, have\nbeen allowed to acquire the complete merit of putting an end to it. It\nwas objected to Pompey, that he came in upon the victories of Lucullus,\nand gathered those laurels which were due to the fortune and valour of\nanother. The glory of Lucullus, it seems, was less complete even in the\nopinion of his own friends, when he was not permitted to finish that\nconquest which his conduct and courage had put in the power of almost\nany man to finish. It mortifies an architect when his plans are either\nnot executed at all, or when they are so far altered as to spoil the\neffect of the building. The plan, however, is all that depends upon the\narchitect. The whole of his genius is, to good judges, as completely\ndiscovered in that as in the actual execution. But a plan does not, even\nto the most intelligent, give the same pleasure as a noble and\nmagnificent building. They may discover as much both of taste and genius\nin the one as in the other. But their effects are still vastly\ndifferent, and the amusement derived from the first, never approaches to\nthe wonder and admiration which are sometimes excited by the second. We\nmay believe of many men, that their talents are superior to those of\nC\u00e6sar and Alexander; and that in the same situations they would perform\nstill greater actions. In the mean time, however, we do not behold them\nwith that astonishment and admiration with which those two heroes have\nbeen regarded in all ages and nations. The calm judgments of the mind\nmay approve of them more, but they want the splendor of great actions to\ndazzle and transport it. The superiority of virtues and talents have\nnot, even upon those who acknowledge that superiority, the same effect\nwith the superiority of atchievements.\nAs the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to do good seems thus, in the\neyes of ungrateful mankind, to be diminished by the miscarriage, so does\nlikewise the demerit of an unsuccessful attempt to do evil. The design\nto commit a crime, how clearly soever it may be proved, is scarce ever\npunished with the same severity as the actual commission of it. The case\nof treason is perhaps the only exception. That crime immediately\naffecting the being of the government itself, the government is\nnaturally more jealous of it than of any other. In the punishment of\ntreason, the sovereign resents the injuries which are immediately done\nto himself: in the punishment of other crimes, he resents those which\nare done to other men. It is his own resentment which he indulges in the\none case: it is that of his subjects which by sympathy he enters into it\nin the other. In the first case, therefore, as he judges in his own\ncause, he is very apt to be more violent and sanguinary in his\npunishments than the impartial spectator can approve of. His resentment\ntoo rises here upon smaller occasions, and does not always, as in other\ncases, wait for the perpetration of the crime, or even for the attempt\nto commit it. A treasonable concert, though nothing has been done, or\neven attempted in consequence of it, nay, a treasonable conversation, is\nin many countries punished in the same manner as the actual commission\nof treason. With regard to all other crimes, the mere design, upon which\nno attempt has followed, is seldom punished at all, and is never\npunished severely. A criminal design, and a criminal action, it may be\nsaid indeed, do not necessarily suppose the same degree of depravity,\nand ought not therefore to be subjected to the same punishment. We are\ncapable, it may be said, of resolving, and even of taking measures to\nexecute, many things which, when it comes to the point, we feel\nourselves altogether incapable of executing. But this reason can have no\nplace when the design has been carried the length of the last attempt.\nThe man, however, who fires a pistol at his enemy, but misses him, is\npunished with death by the laws of scarce any country. By the old law of\nScotland, though he should wound him, yet, unless death ensues within a\ncertain time, the assassin is not liable to the last punishment. The\nresentment of mankind, however, runs so high against this crime, their\nterror for the man who shows himself capable of committing it, is so\ngreat, that the mere attempt to commit it ought in all countries to be\ncapital. The attempt to commit smaller crimes is almost always punished\nvery lightly, and sometimes is not punished at all. The thief, whose\nhand has been caught in his neighbour\u2019s pocket before he had taken any\nthing out of it, is punished with ignominy only. If he had got time to\ntake away an handkerchief, he would have been put to death. The\nhouse-breaker, who has been found setting a ladder to his neighbour\u2019s\nwindow, but had not got into it, is not exposed to the capital\npunishment. The attempt to ravish is not punished as a rape. The attempt\nto seduce a married woman is not punished at all, though seduction is\npunished severely. Our resentment against the person who only attempted\nto do a mischief, is seldom so strong as to bear us out in inflicting\nthe same punishment upon him, which we should have thought due if he had\nactually done it. In the one case, the joy of our deliverance alleviates\nour sense of the atrocity of his conduct; in the other, the grief of our\nmisfortune increases it. His real demerit, however, is undoubtedly the\nsame in both cases, since his intentions were equally criminal: and\nthere is in this respect, therefore, an irregularity in the sentiments\nof all men, and a consequent relaxation of discipline in the laws of, I\nbelieve, all nations, of the most civilized, as well as of the most\nbarbarous. The humanity of a civilized people disposes them either to\ndispense with, or to mitigate punishments wherever their natural\nindignation is not goaded on by the consequences of the crime.\nBarbarians, on the other hand, when no actual consequence has happened\nfrom any action, are not apt to be very delicate or inquisitive about\nthe motives.\nThe person himself who either from passion, or from the influence of bad\ncompany, has resolved, and perhaps taken measures to perpetrate some\ncrime, but who has fortunately been prevented by an accident which put\nit out of his power, is sure, if he has any remains of conscience, to\nregard this event all his life after as a great and signal deliverance.\nHe can never think of it without returning thanks to Heaven for having\nbeen thus graciously pleased to save him from the guilt in which he was\njust ready to plunge himself, and to hinder him from rendering all the\nrest of his life a scene of horror, remorse, and repentance. But though\nhis hands are innocent, he is conscious that his heart is equally guilty\nas if he had actually executed what he was so fully resolved upon. It\ngives great ease to his conscience, however, to consider that the crime\nwas not executed, though he knows that the failure arose from no virtue\nin him. He still considers himself as less deserving of punishment and\nresentment; and this good fortune either diminishes, or takes away\naltogether, all sense of guilt. To remember how much he was resolved\nupon it, has no other effect than to make him regard his escape as the\ngreater and more miraculous: for he still fancies that he has escaped,\nand he looks back upon the danger to which his peace of mind was\nexposed, with that terror, with which one who is in safety may sometimes\nremember the hazard he was in of falling over a precipice, and shudder\nwith horror at the thought.\n2. The second effect of this influence of fortune, is to increase our\nsense of the merit or demerit of actions beyond what is due to the\nmotives or affection from which they proceed, when they happen to give\noccasion to extraordinary pleasure or pain. The agreeable or\ndisagreeable effects of the action often throw a shadow of merit or\ndemerit upon the agent, though in his intention there was nothing that\ndeserved either praise or blame, or at least that deserved them in the\ndegree in which we are apt to bestow them. Thus, even the messenger of\nbad news is disagreeable to us, and, on the contrary, we feel a sort of\ngratitude for the man who brings us good tidings. For a moment we look\nupon them both as the authors, the one of our good, the other of our bad\nfortune, and regard them in some measure as if they had really brought\nabout the events which they only give an account of. The first author of\nour joy is naturally the object of a transitory gratitude: we embrace\nhim with warmth and affection, and should be glad, during the instant of\nour prosperity, to reward him as for some signal service. By the custom\nof all courts, the officer who brings the news of a victory, is entitled\nto considerable preferments, and the general always chuses one of his\nprincipal favourites to go upon so agreeable an errand. The first author\nof our sorrow is, on the contrary, just as naturally the object of a\ntransitory resentment. We can scarce avoid looking upon him with chagrin\nand uneasiness; and the rude and brutal are apt to vent upon him that\nspleen which his intelligence gives occasion to. Tigranes, King of\nArmenia, struck off the head of the man who brought him the first\naccount of the approach of a formidable enemy. To punish in this manner\nthe author of bad tidings, seems barbarous and inhuman: yet, to reward\nthe messenger of good news, is not disagreeable to us; we think it\nsuitable to the bounty of kings. But why do we make this difference,\nsince, if there is no fault in the one, neither is there any merit in\nthe other? It is because any sort of reason seems sufficient to\nauthorize the exertion of the social and benevolent affections; but it\nrequires the most solid and substantial to make us enter into that of\nthe unsocial and malevolent.\nBut though in general we are averse to enter into the unsocial and\nmalevolent affections, though we lay it down for a rule that we ought\nnever to approve of their gratification, unless so far as the malicious\nand unjust intention of the person, against whom they are directed\nrenders him their proper object; yet, upon some occasions, we relax of\nthis severity. When the negligence of one man has occasioned some\nunintended damage to another, we generally enter so far into the\nresentment of the sufferer, as to approve of his inflicting a punishment\nupon the offender much beyond what the offence will have appeared to\ndeserve, had no such unlucky consequence followed from it.\nThere is a degree of negligence, which would appear to deserve some\nchastisement though it should occasion no damage to any body. Thus, if a\nperson should throw a large stone over a wall into a public street\nwithout giving warning to those who might be passing by, and without\nregarding where it was likely to fall, he would undoubtedly deserve some\nchastisement. A very accurate police would punish so absurd an action,\neven though it had done no mischief. The person who has been guilty of\nit, shows an insolent contempt of the happiness and safety of others.\nThere is real injustice in his conduct. He wantonly exposes his\nneighbour to what no man in his senses would chuse to expose himself,\nand evidently wants that sense of what is due to his fellow-creatures\nwhich is the basis of justice and of society. Gross negligence therefore\nis, in the law, said to be almost equal to malicious design[3]. When any\nunlucky consequences happen from such carelessness, the person who has\nbeen guilty of it is often punished as if he had really intended those\nconsequences; and his conduct, which was only thoughtless and insolent,\nand what deserved some chastisement, is considered as atrocious, and as\nliable to the severest punishment. Thus if, by the imprudent action\nabove-mentioned, he should accidentally kill a man, he is, by the laws\nof many countries, particularly by the old law of Scotland, liable to\nthe last punishment. And though this is no doubt excessively severe, it\nis not altogether inconsistent with our natural sentiments. Our just\nindignation against the folly and inhumanity of his conduct is\nexasperated by our sympathy with the unfortunate sufferer. Nothing\nhowever would appear more shocking to our natural sense of equity, than\nto bring a man to the scaffold merely for having thrown a stone\ncarelessly into the street without hurting any body. The folly and\ninhumanity of his conduct, however, would in this case be the same; but\nstill our sentiments would be very different. The consideration of this\ndifference may satisfy us how much the indignation, even of the\nspectator, is apt to be animated by the actual consequences of the\naction. In cases of this kind there will, if I am not mistaken, be found\na great degree of severity in the laws of almost all nations; as I have\nalready observed that in those of an opposite kind there was a very\ngeneral relaxation of discipline.\nFootnote 3:\nLata culpa prope dolum est.\nThere is another degree of negligence which does not involve in it any\nsort of injustice. The person who is guilty of it treats his neighbour\nas he treats himself, means no harm to any body, and is far from\nentertaining any insolent contempt for the safety and happiness of\nothers. He is not, however, so careful and circumspect in his conduct as\nhe ought to be, and deserves upon this account some degree of blame and\ncensure, but no sort of punishment. Yet if by a negligence[4] of this\nkind he should occasion some damage to another person, he is by the laws\nof, I believe, all countries, obliged to compensate it. And though this\nis no doubt a real punishment, and what no mortal would have thought of\ninflicting upon him, had it not been for the unlucky accident which his\nconduct gave occasion to; yet this decision of the law is approved of by\nthe natural sentiments of all mankind. Nothing, we think, can be more\njust than that one man should not suffer by the carelessness of another;\nand that the damage occasioned by blamable negligence should be made up\nby the person who was guilty of it.\nFootnote 4:\nCulpa levis.\nThere is another species of negligence[5], which consists merely in a\nwant of the most anxious timidity and circumspection, with regard to all\nthe possible consequences of our actions. The want of this painful\nattention, when no bad consequences follow from it, is so far from being\nregarded as blamable, that the contrary quality is rather considered as\nsuch. That timid circumspection which is afraid of every thing, is never\nregarded as a virtue, but as a quality which more than any other\nincapacitates for action and business. Yet when, from a want of this\nexcessive care, a person happens to occasion some damage to another, he\nis often by the law obliged to compensate it. Thus, by the Aquilian law,\nthe man, who not being able to manage a horse that had accidentally\ntaken fright, should happen to ride down his neighbour\u2019s slave, is\nobliged to compensate the damage. When an accident of this kind happens,\nwe are apt to think that he ought not to have rode such a horse, and to\nregard his attempting it as an unpardonable levity; though without this\naccident we should not only have made no such reflection, but should\nhave regarded his refusing it as the effect of timid weakness, and of an\nanxiety about merely possible events, which it is to no purpose to be\naware of. The person himself, who by an accident even of this kind has\ninvoluntarily hurt another, seems to have some sense of his own ill\ndesert, with regard to him. He naturally runs up to the sufferer to\nexpress his concern for what has happened, and to make every\nacknowledgment in his power. If he has any sensibility, he necessarily\ndesires to compensate the damage, and to do every thing he can to\nappease that animal resentment, which he is sensible will be apt to\narise in the breast of the sufferer. To make no apology, to offer no\natonement, is regarded as the highest brutality. Yet why should he make\nan apology more than any other person? Why should he, since he was\nequally innocent with any other by-stander, be thus singled out from\namong all mankind, to make up for the bad fortune of another? This task\nwould surely never be imposed upon him, did not even the impartial\nspectator feel some indulgence for what may be regarded as the unjust\nresentment of that other.\nFootnote 5:\nCulpa levissima.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of the final cause of this irregularity of sentiments._\nSuch is the effect of the good or bad consequence of actions upon the\nsentiments both of the person who performs them, and of others; and\nthus, Fortune, which governs the world, has some influence where we\nshould be least willing to allow her any, and directs in some measure\nthe sentiments of mankind, with regard to the character and conduct both\nof themselves and others. That the world judges by the event, and not by\nthe design, has been in all ages the complaint, and is the great\ndiscouragement of virtue. Every body agrees to the general maxim, that\nas the event does not depend on the agent, it ought to have no influence\nupon your sentiments, with regard to the merit or propriety of his\nconduct. But when we come to particulars, we find that our sentiments\nare scarce in any one instance exactly conformable to what this\nequitable maxim would direct. The happy or unprosperous event of any\naction, is not only apt to give us a good or bad opinion of the prudence\nwith which it was conducted, but almost always too animates our\ngratitude or resentment, our sense of the merit or demerit of the\ndesign.\nNature, however, when the implanted the seeds of this irregularity in\nthe human breast, seems, as upon all other occasions, to have intended\nthe happiness and perfection of the species. If the hurtfulness of the\ndesign, if the malevolence of the affection, were alone the causes which\nexcited our resentment, we should feel all the furies of that passion\nagainst any person in whose breast we suspected or believed such designs\nor affections were harboured, though they had never broke out into any\nactions. Sentiments, thoughts, intentions, would become the objects of\npunishment; and if the indignation of mankind ran as high against them\nas against actions; if the baseness of the thought which had given birth\nto no action, seemed in the eyes of the world as much to call aloud for\nvengeance as the baseness of the action, every court of judicature would\nbecome a real inquisition. There would be no safety for the most\ninnocent and circumspect conduct. Bad wishes, bad views, bad designs,\nmight still be suspected; and while these excited the same indignation\nwith bad conduct, while bad intentions were as much resented as bad\nactions, they would equally expose the person to punishment and\nresentment. Actions therefore which either produce actual evil, or\nattempt to produce it, and thereby put us in the immediate fear of it,\nare by the Author of nature rendered the only proper and approved\nobjects of human punishment and resentment. Sentiments, designs,\naffections, though it is from these that according to cool reason human\nactions derive their whole merit or demerit, are placed by the great\nJudge of hearts beyond the limits of every human jurisdiction, and are\nreserved for the cognizance of his own unerring tribunal. That necessary\nrule of justice, therefore, that men in this life are liable to\npunishment for their actions only, not for their designs and intentions,\nis founded upon this salutary and useful irregularity in human\nsentiments concerning merit or demerit, which at first sight appears so\nabsurd and unaccountable. But every part of nature, when attentively\nsurveyed, equally demonstrates the providential care of its Author, and\nwe may admire the wisdom and goodness of God even in the weakness and\nfolly of men.\nNor is that irregularity of sentiments altogether without its utility,\nby which the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to serve, and much more\nthat of mere good inclinations and kind wishes, appears to be imperfect.\nMan was made for action, and to promote by the exertion of his faculties\nsuch changes in the external circumstances both of himself and others,\nas may seem most favourable to the happiness of all. He must not be\nsatisfied with indolent benevolence, nor fancy himself the friend of\nmankind, because in his heart he wishes well to the prosperity of the\nworld. That he may call forth the whole vigour of his soul, and strain\nevery nerve, in order to produce those ends which it is the purpose of\nhis being to advance, Nature has taught him, that neither himself nor\nmankind can be fully satisfied with his conduct, nor bestow upon it the\nfull measure of applause, unless he has actually produced them. He is\nmade to know, that the praise of good intentions, without the merit of\ngood offices, will be but of little avail to excite either the loudest\nacclamations of the world, or even the highest degree of self-applause.\nThe man who has performed no single action of importance, but whose\nwhole conversation and deportment express the justest, the noblest, and\nmost generous sentiments, can be entitled to demand no very high reward,\neven though his inutility should be owing to nothing but the want of an\nopportunity to serve. We can still refuse it him without blame. We can\nstill ask him, what have you done? What actual service can you produce,\nto entitle you to so great a recompense? We esteem you, and love you;\nbut we owe you nothing. To reward indeed that latent virtue which has\nbeen useless only for want of an opportunity to serve, to bestow upon it\nthose honours and preferments, which, though in some measure it may be\nsaid to deserve them, it could not with propriety have insisted upon, is\nthe effect of the most divine benevolence. To punish, on the contrary,\nfor the affections of the heart only, where no crime has been committed,\nis the most insolent and barbarous tyranny. The benevolent affections\nseem to deserve most praise, when they do not wait till it becomes\nalmost a crime for them not to exert themselves. The malevolent, on the\ncontrary, can scarce be too tardy, too slow, or deliberate.\nIt is even of use that the evil which is done without design should be\nregarded as a misfortune to the doer as well as to the sufferer. Man is\nthereby taught to reverence the happiness of his brethren, to tremble\nlest he should, even unknowingly, do any thing that can hurt them, and\nto dread that animal resentment which he feels is ready to burst out\nagainst him, if he should without design be the unhappy instrument of\ntheir calamity.\nNotwithstanding, however, all these seeming irregularities of sentiment,\nif man should unfortunately either give occasion to those evils which he\ndid not intend, or fail in producing that good which he intended, nature\nhas not left his innocence altogether without consolation, nor his\nvirtue altogether without reward. He then calls to his assistance that\njust and equitable maxim, that those events which did not depend upon\nour conduct ought not to diminish the esteem that is due to us. He\nsummons up his whole magnanimity and firmness of soul, and strives to\nregard himself, not in the light in which he at present appears, but in\nthat in which he ought to appear, in which he would have appeared had\nhis generous designs been crowned with success, and in which he would\nstill appear, notwithstanding their miscarriage, if the sentiments of\nmankind were either altogether candid and equitable, or even perfectly\nconsistent with themselves. The more candid and humane part of mankind\nentirely go along with the efforts which he thus makes to support\nhimself in his own opinion. They exert their whole generosity and\ngreatness of mind, to correct in themselves this irregularity of human\nnature, and endeavour to regard his unfortunate magnanimity in the same\nlight in which, had it been successful, they would, without any such\ngenerous exertion, have naturally been disposed to consider it.\nPART III.\nOf the foundation of our judgments concerning our own sentiments and\nconduct, and of the sense of duty.\nCONSISTING OF ONE SECTION.\nCHAP. I.\n_Of the consciousness of merited praise or blame._\nIn the two foregoing parts of this discourse, I have chiefly considered\nthe origin and foundation of our judgments concerning the sentiments and\nconduct of others. I come now to consider the origin of those concerning\nour own.\nThe desire of the approbation and esteem of those we live with, which is\nof such importance to our happiness, cannot be fully and entirely\ncontented but by rendering ourselves the just and proper objects of\nthose sentiments, and by adjusting our own character and conduct\naccording to those measures and rules by which esteem and approbation\nare naturally bestowed. It is not sufficient, that from ignorance or\nmistake, esteem and approbation should some way or other be bestowed\nupon us. If we are conscious that we do not deserve to be so favourably\nthought of, and that if the truth was known, we should be regarded with\nvery opposite sentiments, our satisfaction is far from being complete.\nThe man who applauds us either for actions which we did not perform, or\nfor motives which had no sort of influence upon our conduct, applauds\nnot us, but another person. We can derive no sort of satisfaction from\nhis praises. To us they should be more mortifying than any censure, and\nshould perpetually call to our minds, the most humbling of all\nreflections, the reflection upon what we ought to be, but what we are\nnot. A woman who paints to conceal her ugliness, could derive, one\nshould imagine, but little vanity from the compliments that are paid to\nher beauty. These, we should expect, ought rather to put her in mind of\nthe sentiments which her real complexion would excite, and mortify her\nmore by the contrast. To be pleased with such groundless applause is a\nproof of the most superficial levity and weakness. It is what is\nproperly called vanity, and is the foundation of the most ridiculous and\ncontemptible vices, the vices of affectation and common lying; follies\nwhich, if experience did not teach us how common they are, one should\nimagine the least spark of common sense would save us from. The foolish\nliar, who endeavours to excite the admiration of the company by the\nrelation of adventures which never had any existence, the important\ncoxcomb who gives himself airs of rank and distinction which he well\nknows he has no just pretensions to, are both of them, no doubt, pleased\nwith the applause which they fancy they meet with. But their vanity\narises from so gross an illusion of the imagination, that it is\ndifficult to conceive how any rational creature should be imposed upon\nby it. When they place themselves in the situation of those whom they\nfancy they have deceived, they are struck with the highest admiration\nfor their own persons. They look upon themselves, not in that light in\nwhich, they know, they ought to appear to their companions, but in that\nin which they believe their companions actually look upon them. Their\nsuperficial weakness and trivial folly hinder them from ever turning\ntheir eyes inwards, or from seeing themselves in that despicable point\nof view in which their own consciences should tell them that they would\nappear to every body, if the real truth should ever come to be known.\nAs ignorant and groundless praise can give no solid joy, no satisfaction\nthat will bear any serious examination, so, on the contrary, it often\ngives real comfort to reflect, that though no praise should actually be\nbestowed upon us, our conduct, however, has been such as to deserve it,\nand has been in every respect suitable to those measures and rules by\nwhich praise and approbation are naturally and commonly bestowed. We are\npleased not only with praise, but with having done what is\npraise-worthy. We are pleased to think that we have rendered ourselves\nthe natural objects of approbation, though no approbation, should ever\nactually be bestowed upon us: and we are mortified to reflect that we\nhave justly incurred the blame of those we live with, though that\nsentiment should never actually be exerted against us. The man who is\nconscious to himself that he has exactly observed those measures of\nconduct which experience informs him are generally agreeable, reflects\nwith satisfaction on the propriety of his own behaviour; when he views\nit in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it, he\nthoroughly enters into all the motives which influenced it; he looks\nback upon every part of it with pleasure and approbation, and though\nmankind should never be acquainted with what he has done, he regards\nhimself not so much according to the light in which they actually regard\nhim, as according to that, in which they would regard him if they were\nbetter informed. He anticipates the applause and admiration which in\nthis case would be bestowed upon him, and he applauds and admires\nhimself by sympathy with sentiments which do not indeed actually take\nplace, but which the ignorance of the public alone hinders from taking\nplace, which he knows are the natural and ordinary effects of such\nconduct, which his imagination strongly connects with it, and which he\nhas acquired a habit of conceiving as something that naturally and in\npropriety ought to flow from it. Men have often voluntarily thrown away\nlife to acquire after death a renown which they could no longer enjoy.\nTheir imagination, in the mean time, anticipated that fame which was\nthereafter to be bestowed upon them. Those applauses which they were\nnever to hear rung in their ears; the thoughts of that admiration, whose\neffects they were never to feel, played about their hearts, banished\nfrom their breasts the strongest of all natural fears, and transported\nthem to perform actions which seem aimed beyond the reach of human\nnature. But in point of reality there is surely no great difference\nbetween that approbation which is not to be bestowed till we can no\nlonger enjoy it, and that which indeed is never to be bestowed, but\nwhich would be bestowed if the world was ever made to understand\nproperly the real circumstances of our behaviour. If the one often\nproduces such violent effects, we cannot wonder that the other should\nalways be highly regarded.\nOn the contrary, the man who has broke through all those measures of\nconduct, which can alone render him agreeable to mankind, tho\u2019 he should\nhave the most perfect assurance that what he had done was for ever to be\nconcealed from every human eye, it is all to no purpose. When he looks\nback upon it, and views it in the light in which the impartial spectator\nwould view it, he finds that he can enter into none of the motives which\ninfluenced it. He is abashed and confounded at the thoughts of it, and\nnecessarily feels a very high degree of that shame which he would be\nexposed to, if his actions should ever come to be generally known. His\nimagination, in this case too, anticipates the contempt and derision\nfrom which nothing saves him but the ignorance of those he lives with.\nHe still feels that he is the natural object of these sentiments, and\nstill trembles at the thought of what he would suffer if they were ever\nactually exerted against him. But if what he had been guilty of was not\nmerely one of those improprieties which are the objects of simple\ndisapprobation, but one of those enormous crimes which excite\ndetestation and resentment, he could never think of it, as long as he\nhad any sensibility left, without feeling all the agony of horror and\nremorse; and though he could be assured that no man was ever to know it,\nand could even bring himself to believe that there was no God to revenge\nit, he would still feel enough of both these sentiments to embitter the\nwhole of his life: He would still regard himself as the natural object\nof the hatred and indignation of all his fellow-creatures; and if his\nheart was not grown callous by the habit of crimes, he could not think\nwithout terror and astonishment even of the manner in which mankind\nwould look upon him, of what would be the expression of their\ncountenance and of their eyes, if the dreadful truth should ever come to\nbe known. These natural pangs of an affrighted conscience are the\nd\u00e6mons, the avenging furies which in this life haunt the guilty, which\nallow them neither quiet nor repose, which often drive them to despair\nand distraction, from which no assurance of secrecy can protect them,\nfrom which no principles of irreligion can entirely deliver them, and\nfrom which nothing can free them but the vilest and most abject of all\nstates, a complete insensibility of honour and infamy, to vice and\nvirtue. Men of the most detestable characters, who, in the execution of\nthe most dreadful crimes, had taken their measures so coolly as to avoid\neven the suspicion of guilt, have sometimes been driven, by the horror\nof their situation, to discover of their own accord, what no human\nsagacity could ever have investigated. By acknowledging their guilt, by\nsubmitting themselves to the resentment of their offended citizens, and\nby thus satiating that vengeance of which they were sensible that they\nwere become the proper objects, they hoped by their death to reconcile\nthemselves, at least in their own imagination, to the natural sentiments\nof mankind, to be able to consider themselves as less worthy of hatred\nand resentment, to atone in some measure for their crimes, and, if\npossible, to die in peace and with the forgiveness of all their\nfellow-creatures. Compared to what they felt before the discovery, even\nthe thought of this, it seems, was happiness.\nCHAP. II.\n_In what manner our own judgments refer to what ought to be the\njudgments of others: and of the origin of general rules._\nA great part, perhaps the greatest part, of human happiness and misery\narises from the view of our past conduct, and from the degree of\napprobation or disapprobation which we feel from the consideration of\nit. But in whatever manner it may affect us, our sentiments of this kind\nhave always some secret reference either to what are, or to what upon a\ncertain condition would be, or to what we imagine ought to be the\nsentiments of others. We examine it as we imagine an impartial spectator\nwould examine it. If upon placing ourselves in his situation we\nthoroughly enter into all the passions and motives which influenced it,\nwe approve of it by sympathy with the approbation of this supposed\nequitable judge. If otherwise, we enter into his disapprobation and\ncondemn it.\nWas it possible that a human creature could grow up to manhood in some\nsolitary place without any communication with his own species, he could\nno more think of his own character, of the propriety or demerit of his\nown sentiments and conduct, of the beauty or deformity of his own mind,\nthan of the beauty or deformity of his own face. All these are objects\nwhich he cannot easily see, which naturally he does not look at; and\nwith regard to which he is provided with no mirror which can present\nthem to his view. Bring him into society, and he is immediately provided\nwith the mirror which he wanted before. It is placed in the countenance\nand behaviour of those he lives with, which always mark when they enter\ninto, and when they disapprove of his sentiments; and it is here that he\nfirst views the propriety and impropriety of his own passions, the\nbeauty and deformity of his own mind. To a man who from his birth was a\nstranger to society, the objects of his passions, the external bodies\nwhich either pleased or hurt him, would occupy his whole attention. The\npassions themselves, the desires or aversions, the joys or sorrows,\nwhich those objects excited, though of all things the most immediately\npresent to him, could scarce ever be the objects of his thoughts. The\nidea of them could never interest him so much as to call upon his\nattentive consideration. The consideration of his joy could in him\nexcite no new joy, nor that of his sorrow any new sorrow, though the\nconsideration of the causes of those passions might often excite both.\nBring him into society, and all his own passions will immediately become\nthe causes of new passions. He will observe that mankind approve of some\nof them, and are disgusted by others. He will be elevated in the one\ncase, and cast down in the other; his desires and aversions, his joys\nand sorrows will now often become the causes of new desires and new\naversions, new joys and new sorrows: they will now therefore interest\nhim deeply, and often call upon his most attentive consideration.\nOur first ideas of personal beauty and deformity, are drawn from the\nshape and appearance of others, not from our own. We soon become\nsensible, however, that others exercise the same criticism upon us. We\nare pleased when they approve of our figure, and are disobliged when\nthey seem to be disgusted. We become anxious to know how far our\nappearance deserves either their blame or approbation. We examine our\nown persons limb by limb, and by placing ourselves before a\nlooking-glass, or by some such expedient, endeavour, as much as\npossible, to view ourselves at the distance and with the eyes of other\npeople. If after this examination we are satisfied with our own\nappearance, we can more easily support the most disadvantageous\njudgments of others: if, on the contrary, we are sensible that we are\nthe natural objects of distaste, every appearance of their\ndisapprobation mortifies us beyond all measure. A man who is tolerably\nhandsome, will allow you to laugh at any little irregularity in his\nperson; but all such jokes are commonly insupportable to one who is\nreally deformed. It is evident, however, that we are anxious about our\nown beauty and deformity only on account of its effect upon others. If\nwe had no connexion with society, we should be altogether indifferent\nabout either.\nIn the same manner our first moral criticisms are exercised upon the\ncharacters and conduct of other people; and we are all very forward to\nobserve how each of these affects us. But we soon learn, that others are\nequally frank with regard to our own. We become anxious to know how far\nwe deserve their censure or applause, and whether to them we must\nnecessarily appear those agreeable or disagreeable creatures which they\nrepresent us. We begin upon this account to examine our own passions and\nconduct, and to consider how these must appear to them, by considering\nhow they would appear to us if in their situation. We suppose ourselves\nthe spectators of our own behaviour, and endeavour to imagine what\neffect it would, in this light, produce upon us. This is the only\nlooking-glass by which we can, in some measure, with the eyes of others,\nscrutinize the propriety of our own conduct. If in this view it pleases\nus, we are tolerably satisfied. We can be more indifferent about the\napplause, and, in some measure, despise the censure of others; secure\nthat, however misunderstood or misrepresented, we are the natural and\nproper objects of approbation. On the contrary, if we are displeased\nwith it, we are often upon that very account more anxious to gain their\napprobation, and, provided we have not already, as they say, shaken\nhands with infamy, we are altogether distracted at the thoughts of their\ncensure, which then strikes us with double severity.\nWhen I endeavour to examine my own conduct, when I endeavour to pass\nsentence upon it, and either to approve or condemn it, it is evident\nthat, in all such cases, I divide myself, as it were, into two persons,\nand that I, the examiner and judge, represent a different character from\nthat other I, the person whose conduct is examined into and judged of.\nThe first is the spectator, whose sentiments with regard to my own\nconduct I endeavour to enter into, by placing myself in his situation,\nand by considering how it would appear to me when seen from that\nparticular point of view. The second is the agent, the person whom I\nproperly call myself, and of whose conduct, under the character of a\nspectator, I was endeavouring to form some opinion. The first is the\njudge; the second the pannel. But that the judge should, in every\nrespect, be the same with the pannel, is as impossible, as that the\ncause should, in every respect, be the same with the effect.\nTo be amiable and to be meritorious, that is, to deserve love and to\ndeserve reward, are the great characters of virtue, and to be odious and\npunishable, of vice. But all these characters have an immediate\nreference to the sentiments of others. Virtue is not said to be amiable\nor to be meritorious, because it is the object of its own love, or of\nits own gratitude; but because it excites those sentiments in other men.\nThe consciousness that it is the object of such favourable regards is\nthe source of that inward tranquillity and self-satisfaction with which\nit is naturally attended, as the suspicion of the contrary gives\noccasion to the torments of vice. What so great happiness as to be\nbeloved, and to know that we deserve to be beloved? What so great misery\nas to be hated, and to know that we deserve to be hated?\nMan is considered as a moral, because he is regarded as an accountable\nbeing. But an accountable being, as the word expresses, is a being that\nmust give an account of its actions to some other, and that consequently\nmust regulate them according to the good liking of this other. Man is\naccountable to God and his fellow-creatures. But though he is, no doubt,\nprincipally accountable to God; in the order of time, he must\nnecessarily conceive himself as accountable to his fellow-creatures,\nbefore he can form any idea of the Deity, or of the rules by which that\ndivine being will judge of his conduct. A child surely conceives itself\nas accountable to its parents, and is elevated or cast down by the\nthought of their merited approbation or disapprobation, long before it\nforms any idea of its accountableness to the Deity, or of the rules by\nwhich that divine being will judge of its conduct.\nThe great judge of the world, has, for the wisest reasons, thought\nproper to interpose, between the weak eye of human reason, and the\nthrone of his eternal justice, a degree of obscurity and darkness, which\nthough it does not entirely cover that great tribunal from the view of\nmankind, yet renders the impression of it faint and feeble in comparison\nof what might be expected from the grandeur and importance of so mighty\nan object. If those infinite rewards and punishments which the Almighty\nhas prepared for those who obey or transgress his will, were perceived\nas distinctly as we foresee the frivolous and temporary retaliations\nwhich we may expect from one another, the weakness of human nature,\nastonished at the immensity of objects so little fitted to its\ncomprehension, could no longer attend to the little affairs of this\nworld; and it is absolutely impossible that the business of society\ncould have been carried on, if, in this respect, there had been a fuller\nrevelation of the intentions of Providence than that which has already\nbeen made. That men, however, might never be without a rule to direct\ntheir conduct by, nor without a judge whose authority should enforce its\nobservation, the Author of nature has made man the immediate judge of\nmankind, and has, in this respect, as in many others, created him after\nhis own image, and appointed him his vicegerent upon earth, to\nsuperintend the behaviour of his brethren. They are taught by nature to\nacknowledge that power and jurisdiction which has thus been conferred\nupon him, and to tremble and exult according as they imagine that they\nhave either merited his censure, or deserved his applause.\nBut whatever may be the authority of this inferior tribunal which is\ncontinually before their eyes, if at any time it should decide contrary\nto those principles and rules, which Nature has established for\nregulating its judgments, men feel that they may appeal from this unjust\ndecision, and call upon a superior tribunal, the tribunal established in\ntheir own breasts, to redress the injustice of this weak or partial\njudgment.\nThere are certain principles established by Nature for governing our\njudgment concerning the conduct of those we live with. As long as we\ndecide according to those principles, and neither applaud nor condemn\nany thing which Nature has not rendered the proper object of applause or\ncondemnation, nor any further than she has rendered it such, as our\nsentence is, in this case, if I may say so, quite agreeable to law, it\nis liable neither to repeal nor to correction of any kind. The person\nconcerning whom we form these judgments, must himself necessarily\napprove of them. When he puts himself into our situation, he cannot\navoid viewing his own conduct in the very same light in which we appear\nto view it. He is sensible, that to us, and to every impartial\nspectator, he must necessarily appear the natural and proper object of\nthose sentiments which we express with regard to him. Those sentiments,\ntherefore, must necessarily produce their full effect upon him, and he\ncannot fail to conceive all the triumph of self-approbation from, what\nappears to him, such merited applause, as well as all the horrors of\nshame from, what, he is sensible, is such deserved condemnation.\nBut it is otherwise, if we have either applauded or condemned him,\ncontrary to those principles and rules which Nature has established for\nthe direction of our judgments concerning every thing of this kind. If\nwe have either applauded or condemned him for what, when he put himself\ninto our situation, does not appear to him to be the object either of\napplause or condemnation; as in this case he cannot enter into our\nsentiments, provided he has any constancy or firmness, he is but little\naffected by them, and can neither be much elevated by the favourable,\nnor greatly mortified by the unfavourable decision. The applause of the\nwhole world will avail but little, if our own conscience condemn us; and\nthe disapprobation of all mankind is not capable of oppressing us, when\nwe are absolved by the tribunal within our own breast, and when our own\nmind tells us that mankind are in the wrong.\nBut though this tribunal within the breast be thus the supreme arbiter\nof all our actions, though it can reverse the decisions of all mankind\nwith regard to our character and conduct, and mortify us amidst the\napplause, or support us under the censure of the world; yet, if we\ninquire into the origin of its institution, its jurisdiction we shall\nfind is in a great measure derived from the authority of that very\ntribunal, whose decisions it so often and so justly reverses.\nWhen we first come into the world, from the natural desire to please, we\naccustom ourselves to consider what behaviour is likely to be agreeable\nto every person we converse with, to our parents, to our masters, to our\ncompanions. We address ourselves to individuals, and for some time\nfondly pursue the impossible and absurd project of gaining the good-will\nand approbation of every body. We are soon taught by experience,\nhowever, that this universal approbation is altogether unattainable. As\nsoon as we come to have more important interests to manage, we find,\nthat by pleasing one man, we almost certainly disoblige another, and\nthat by humouring an individual, we may often irritate a whole people.\nThe fairest and most equitable conduct must frequently obstruct the\ninterests, or thwart the inclinations of particular persons, who will\nseldom have candour enough to enter into the propriety of our motives,\nor to see that this conduct, how disagreeable soever to them, is\nperfectly suitable to our situation. In order to defend ourselves from\nsuch partial judgments, we soon learn to set up in our own minds a judge\nbetween ourselves and those we live with. We conceive ourselves as\nacting in the presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one\nwho has no particular relation either to ourselves, or to those whose\ninterests are affected by our conduct, who is neither father, nor\nbrother, nor friend either to them or to us, but is merely a man in\ngeneral, an impartial spectator who considers our conduct with the same\nindifference with which we regard that of other people. If, when we\nplace ourselves in the situation of such a person, our own actions\nappear to us under an agreeable aspect, if we feel that such a spectator\ncannot avoid entering into all the motives which influenced us, whatever\nmay be the judgments of the world, we must still be pleased with our own\nbehaviour, and regard ourselves, in spite of the censure of our\ncompanions, as the just and proper objects of approbation.\nOn the contrary, if the man within condemns us, the loudest acclamations\nof mankind appear but as the noise of ignorance and folly, and whenever\nwe assume the character of this impartial judge, we cannot avoid viewing\nour own actions with this distaste and dissatisfaction. The weak, the\nvain, and the frivolous, indeed, may be mortified by the most groundless\ncensure, or elated by the most absurd applause. Such persons are not\naccustomed to consult the judge within concerning the opinion which they\nought to form of their own conduct. This inmate of the breast, this\nabstract man, the representative of mankind, and substitute of the\nDeity, whom Nature has constituted the supreme judge of all their\nactions, is seldom appealed to by them. They are contented with the\ndecision of the inferior tribunal. The approbation of their companions,\nof the particular persons whom they have lived and conversed with, has\ngenerally been the ultimate object of all their wishes. If they obtain\nthis, their joy is complete; and if they fail, they are entirely\ndisappointed. They never think of appealing to the superior court. They\nhave seldom inquired after its decisions, and are altogether\nunacquainted with the rules and forms of its procedure. When the world\ninjures them, therefore, they are incapable of doing themselves justice,\nand are, in consequence, necessarily the slaves of the world. But it is\notherwise with the man who has, upon all occasions, been accustomed to\nhave recourse to the judge within, and to consider, not what the world\napproves or disapproves of, but what appears to this impartial\nspectator, the natural and proper object of approbation or\ndisapprobation. The judgment of this supreme arbiter of his conduct, is\nthe applause, which he has been accustomed principally to court, is the\ncensure which he has been accustomed principally to fear. Compared with\nthis final decision, the sentiments of all mankind, though not\naltogether indifferent, appear to be but of small moment; and he is\nincapable of being either much elevated by their favourable, or greatly\ndepressed by their most disadvantageous judgment.\nIt is only by consulting this judge within, that we can see whatever\nrelates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions, or that we can\nmake any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other\nmen.\nAs to the eye of the body, objects appear great or small, not so much\naccording to their real dimensions, as according to the nearness or\ndistance of their situation; so do they likewise to what may be called\nthe natural eye of the mind: and we remedy the defects of both these\norgans pretty much in the same manner. In my present situation an\nimmense landscape of lawns, and woods, and distant mountains, seems to\ndo no more than cover the little window which I write by, and to be out\nof all proportion less than the chamber in which I am sitting. I can\nform a just comparison between those great objects and the little\nobjects around me, in no other way, than by transporting myself, at\nleast in fancy, to a different station, from whence I can survey both at\nnearly equal distances, and thereby form some judgment of their real\nproportions. Habit and experience have taught me to do this so easily\nand so readily, that I am scarce sensible that I do it; and a man must\nbe, in some measure, acquainted with the philosophy of vision, before he\ncan be thoroughly convinced, how little those distant objects would\nappear to the eye, if the imagination, from a knowledge of their real\nmagnitudes, did not swell and dilate them.\nIn the same manner, to the selfish and original passions of human\nnature, the loss or gain of a very small interest of our own, appears to\nbe of vastly more importance, excites a much more passionate joy or\nsorrow, a much more ardent desire or aversion, than the greatest concern\nof another with whom we have no particular connexion. His interests, as\nlong as they are surveyed from this station, can never be put into the\nbalance with our own, can never restrain us from doing whatever may tend\nto promote our own, how ruinous soever to him. Before we can make any\nproper comparison of those opposite interests, we must change our\nposition. We must view them, neither from our own place, nor yet from\nhis, neither with our own eyes nor yet with his, but from the place, and\nwith the eyes of a third person, who has no particular connexion with\neither, and who judges with impartiality between us. Here too, habit and\nexperience have taught us to do this so easily and so readily, that we\nare scarce sensible that we do it; and it requires, in this case too,\nsome degree of reflection, and even of philosophy to convince us, how\nlittle interest we should take in the greatest concerns of our\nneighbour, how little we should be affected by whatever relates to him,\nif the sense of propriety and justice did not correct the otherwise\nnatural inequality of our sentiments.\nLet us suppose that the great empire of China, with all its myriads of\ninhabitants, was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake, and let us\nconsider how a man of humanity in Europe, who had no sort of connexion\nwith that part of the world, would be affected upon receiving\nintelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would, I imagine, first of\nall, express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy\npeople, he would make many melancholy reflections upon the\nprecariousness of human life, and the vanity of all the labours of man,\nwhich could thus be annihilated in a moment. He would too, perhaps, if\nhe was a man of speculation, enter into many reasonings concerning the\neffects which this disaster might produce upon the commerce of Europe,\nand the trade and business of the world in general. And when all this\nfine philosophy was over, when all these humane sentiments had been once\nfairly expressed, he would pursue his business or his pleasure, take his\nrepose or his diversion, with the same ease and tranquility, as if no\nsuch accident had happened. The most frivolous disaster which could\nbefal himself would occasion a more real disturbance. If he was to lose\nhis little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but provided\nhe never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over\nthe ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of\nthat immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him,\nthan this paultry misfortune of his own. To prevent therefore, this\npaultry misfortune to himself would a man of humanity be willing to\nsacrifice the lives of a hundred millions of his brethren, provided he\nhad never seen them? Human nature startles with horror at the thought,\nand the world, in its greatest depravity and corruption, never produced\nsuch a villain as could be capable of entertaining it. But what makes\nthis difference? When our passive feelings are almost always so sordid\nand so selfish, how comes it that our active principles should often be\nso generous and so noble? When we are always so much more deeply\naffected by whatever concerns ourselves, than by whatever concerns other\nmen; what is it which prompts the generous, upon all occasions, and the\nmean upon many, to sacrifice their own interests to the greater\ninterests of others? It is not the soft power of humanity, it is not\nthat feeble spark of benevolence which Nature has lighted up in the\nhuman heart, that is thus capable of counteracting the strongest\nimpulses of self-love. It is a stronger power, a more forcible motive,\nwhich exerts itself upon such occasions. It is reason, principle,\nconscience, the inhabitant of the breast, the man within, the great\njudge and arbiter of our conduct. It is he, who, whenever we are about\nto act so as to affect the happiness of others, calls to us with a voice\ncapable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions, that we\nare but one of the multitude, in no respect better than any other in it;\nand that when we prefer ourselves so shamefully and so blindly to\nothers, we become the proper objects of resentment, abhorrence, and\nexecration. It is from him only that we learn the real littleness of\nourselves, and of whatever relates to ourselves, and the natural\nmisrepresentations of self-love can be corrected only by the eye of this\nimpartial spectator. It is he who shows us the propriety of generality\nand the deformity of injustice; the propriety of resigning the greatest\ninterests of our own, for the yet greater interests of others, and the\ndeformity of doing the smallest injury to another, in order to obtain\nthe greatest benefit to ourselves. It is not the love of our neighbour,\nit is not the love of mankind, which upon many occasions prompts us to\nthe practice of those divine virtues. It is a stronger love, a more\npowerful affection which generally takes place upon such occasions, the\nlove of what is honourable and noble, of the grandeur, and dignity, and\nsuperiority of our own characters.\nWhen the happiness or misery of others depends in any respect upon our\nconduct, we dare not, as self-love would suggest to us, prefer any\nlittle interest of our own, to the yet greater interest of our\nneighbour. We feel that we should become the proper objects of the\nresentment and indignation of our brethren, and the sense of the\nimpropriety of this affection is supported and enlivened by the yet\nstronger sense of the demerit of the action, which it would in this case\ngive occasion to. But when the happiness or misery of others in no\nrespect depends upon our conduct, when our own interests are altogether\nseparated and detached from theirs, so that there is neither connexion\nnor competition between them, as the sense of demerit does not in this\ncase interpose, the mere sense of impropriety is seldom able to restrain\nus from abandoning ourselves to our natural anxiety about our own\naffairs, and to our natural indifference about those of other men. The\nmost vulgar education teaches us to act, upon all important occasions,\nwith some sort of impartiality between ourselves and others, and even\nthe ordinary commerce of the world is capable of adjusting our active\nprinciples to some degree of propriety. But it is the most artificial\nand refined education only, which pretends to correct the inequalities\nof our passive feelings, and we must for this purpose have recourse to\nthe severest, as well as to the profoundest philosophy.\nTwo different sets of philosophers have attempted to teach us this\nhardest of all the lessons of morality. One set have laboured to\nincrease our sensibility to the interests of others; another to diminish\nthat to our own. The first would have us feel for others as we naturally\nfeel for ourselves. The second would have us feel for ourselves, as we\nnaturally feel for others.\nThe first are those melancholy moralists, who are perpetually\nreproaching us with our happiness, while so many of our brethren are in\nmisery,[6] who regard as impious the natural joy of prosperity, which\ndoes not think of the many wretches that are at every instant labouring\nunder all sorts of calamities, in the languor of poverty, in the agony\nof disease, in the horrors of death, under the insults and oppression of\ntheir enemies. Commiseration for those miseries which we never saw,\nwhich we never heard of, but which we may be assured are at all times\ninfecting such numbers of our fellow-creatures, ought, they think, to\ndamp the pleasures of the fortunate, and to render a certain melancholy\ndejection habitual to all men. But first of all, this extreme sympathy\nwith misfortunes, which we know nothing about, seems altogether absurd\nand unreasonable. Take the whole earth at an average, for one man who\nsuffers pain or misery, you will find twenty in prosperity and joy, or\nat least in tolerable circumstances. No reason, surely, can be assigned\nwhy we should rather weep with the one than rejoice with the twenty.\nThis artificial commiseration, besides, is not only absurd, but seems\naltogether unattainable; and those who affect this character have\ncommonly nothing but a certain hypocritical sadness, which, without\nreaching the heart, serves only to render the countenance and\nconvocation impertinently dismal and disagreeable. And last of all, this\ndisposition of mind, though it could be attained, would be perfectly\nuseless, and could serve no other purpose than to render miserable the\nperson who was possessed of it. Whatever interest we take in the fortune\nof those with whom we have no acquaintance or connexion, and who are\nplaced altogether out of the sphere of our activity, can produce only\nanxiety to ourselves, without any manner of advantage to them. To what\npurpose should we trouble ourselves about the world in the moon? All\nmen, even those at the greatest distance, are no doubt entitled to our\ngood wishes, and our good wishes we naturally give them. But if,\nnotwithstanding, they should be unfortunate, to give ourselves any\nanxiety upon that account, seems to be no part of our duty. That we\nshould be but little interested, therefore, in the fortune of those whom\nwe can neither serve nor hurt, and who are in every respect so very\nremote from us, seems wisely ordered by nature; and if it were possible\nto alter in this respect the original constitution of our frame, we\ncould yet gain nothing by the change.\nFootnote 6:\nSee Thomson\u2019s Seasons, Winter:\n\u201cAh! little think the gay licentious proud,\u201d &c.\nSee also Pascal.\nAmong the moralists who endeavour to correct the natural inequality of\nour passive feelings by diminishing our sensibility to what peculiarly\nconcerns ourselves, we may count all the ancient sects of philosophers,\nbut particularly the ancient stoics. Man, according to the stoics, ought\nto regard himself, not as something separated and detached, but as a\ncitizen of the world, a member of the vast commonwealth of nature. To\nthe interest of this great community, he ought at all times to be\nwilling that his own little interest should be sacrificed. Whatever\nconcerns himself, ought to affect him no more than whatever concerns any\nother equally important part of this immense system. We should view\nourselves, not in the light in which our own selfish passions are apt to\nplace us, but in the light in which any other citizen of the world would\nview us. What befalls ourselves we should regard as what befalls our\nneighbour, or, what comes to the same thing, as our neighbour regards\nwhat befalls us. \u201cWhen our neighbour,\u201d says Epictetus, \u201closes his wife\nor his son, there is nobody who is not sensible that this is a human\ncalamity, a natural event altogether, according to the ordinary course\nof things: but when the same thing happens to ourselves, then we cry\nout, as if we had suffered the most dreadful misfortune. We ought,\nhowever, to remember how we were affected when this accident happened to\nanother, and such as we were in his case, such ought we to be in our\nown.\u201d How difficult soever it may be to attain this supreme degree of\nmagnanimity and firmness, it is by no means either absurd or useless to\nattempt it. Though few men have the stoical idea of what this perfect\npropriety requires, yet all men endeavour in some measure to command\nthemselves, and to bring down their selfish passions to something which\ntheir neighbour can go along with. But this can never be done so\neffectually as by viewing whatever befalls themselves in the light in\nwhich their neighbours are apt to view it. The stoical philosophy, in\nthis respect, does little more than unfold our natural ideas of\nperfection. There is nothing absurd or improper, therefore, in aiming at\nthis perfect self-command. Neither would the attainment of it be\nuseless, but, on the contrary, the most advantageous of all things, as\nestablishing our happiness upon the most solid and secure foundation, a\nfirm confidence in that wisdom and justice which governs the world, and\nan entire resignation of ourselves, and of whatever relates to ourselves\nto the all-wise disposal of this ruling principle in nature.\nIt scarce ever happens, however, that we are capable of adjusting our\npassive feelings to this perfect propriety. We indulge ourselves, and\neven the world indulges us, in some degree of irregularity in this\nrespect. Though we should be too much affected by what concerns\nourselves, and too little by what concerns other men, yet, if we always\nact with impartiality between ourselves and others, if we never actually\nsacrifice any great interest of others, to any little interest of our\nown, we are easily pardoned: and it were well, if, upon all occasions,\nthose who desire to do their duty were capable of maintaining even this\ndegree of impartiality between themselves and others. But this is very\nfar from being the case. Even in good men, the judge within is often in\ndanger of being corrupted by the violence and injustice of their selfish\npassions, and is often induced to make a report very different from what\nthe real circumstances of the case are capable of authorizing.\nThere are two different occasions, upon which we examine our own\nconduct, and endeavour to view it in the light in which the impartial\nspectator would view it. First, when we are about to act; and, secondly,\nafter we have acted. Our views are very partial in both cases, but they\nare most so, when it is of most importance that they should be\notherwise.\nWhen we are about to act, the eagerness of passion will seldom allow us\nto consider what we are doing with the candour of an indifferent person.\nThe violent emotions which at that time agitate us, discolour our views\nof things, even when we are endeavouring to place ourselves in the\nsituation of another, and to regard the objects that interest us, in the\nlight in which they will naturally appear to him. The fury of our own\npassions constantly calls us back to our own place, where every thing\nappears magnified and misrepresented by self-love. Of the manner in\nwhich those objects would appear to another, of the view which he would\ntake of them, we can obtain, if I may say so, but instantaneous\nglimpses, which vanish in a moment, and which even while they last are\nnot altogether just. We cannot even for that moment divest ourselves\nentirely of the heat and keenness with which our peculiar situation\ninspires us, nor consider what we are about to do with the complete\nimpartiality of an equitable judge. The passions, upon this account, as\nfather Malebranche says, all justify themselves, and seem reasonable,\nand proportioned to their objects, as long as we continue to feel them.\nWhen the action is over, indeed, and the passions which prompted it have\nsubsided, we can enter more coolly into sentiments of the indifferent\nspectator. What before interested us, is now become almost as\nindifferent to us as it always was to him, and we can now examine our\nown conduct with his candour and impartiality. But our judgments now are\nof little importance, compared to what they were before; and when they\nare most severely impartial, can commonly produce nothing but vain\nregret, and unavailing repentance, without securing us from the like\nerrors for the future. It is seldom, however, that they are quite candid\neven in this case. The opinion which we entertain of our own character,\ndepends entirely on our judgment concerning our past conduct. It is so\ndisagreeable to think ill of ourselves, that we often purposely turn\naway our view from those circumstances which might render that judgment\nunfavourable. He is a bold surgeon, they say, whose hand does not\ntremble when he performs an operation upon his own person; and he is\noften equally bold who does not hesitate to pull off the mysterious veil\nof self-delusion, which covers from his view the deformities of his own\nconduct. Rather than see our own behaviour under so disagreeable an\naspect, we too often, foolishly and weakly, endeavour to exasperate anew\nthose unjust passions which had formerly misled us; we endeavour by\nartifice to awaken our old hatreds, and irritate afresh our almost\nforgotten resentments: we even exert ourselves for this miserable\npurpose, and thus persevere in injustice, merely because we once were\nunjust, and because we are ashamed and afraid to see that we were so.\nSo partial are the views of mankind with regard to the propriety of\ntheir own conduct, both at the time of action and after it; and so\ndifficult is it for them to view it in the light in which any\nindifferent spectator would consider it. But if it was by a peculiar\nfaculty, such as the moral sense is supposed to be, that they judged of\ntheir own conduct, if they were endued with a particular power of\nperception, which distinguished the beauty or deformity of passions and\naffections; as their own passions would be more immediately exposed to\nthe view of this faculty, it would judge with more accuracy concerning\nthem, than concerning those of other men, of which it had only a more\ndistant prospect.\nThis self-deceit, this fatal weakness of mankind, is the source of half\nthe disorders of human life. If we saw ourselves in the light in which\nothers see us, or in which they would see us if they knew all, a\nreformation would generally be unavoidable. We could not otherwise\nendure the sight.\nNature, however, has not left this weakness, which is of so much\nimportance, altogether without a remedy; nor has she abandoned us\nentirely to the delusions of self-love. Our continual observations upon\nthe conduct of others, insensibly lead us to form to ourselves certain\ngeneral rules concerning what is fit and proper either to be done or to\nbe avoided. Some of their actions shock all our natural sentiments. We\nhear every body about us express the like detestation against them. This\nstill further confirms, and even exasperates our natural sense of their\ndeformity. It satisfies us that we view them in the proper light, when\nwe see other people view them in the same light. We resolve never to be\nguilty of the like, nor ever, upon any account, to render ourselves in\nthis manner the objects of universal disapprobation. We thus naturally\nlay down to ourselves a general rule, that all such actions are to be\navoided, as tending to render us odious, contemptible, or punishable,\nthe objects of all those sentiments for which we have the greatest dread\nand aversion. Other actions, on the contrary, call forth our\napprobation, and we hear every body around us express the same\nfavourable opinion concerning them. Every body is eager to honour and\nreward them. They excite all those sentiments for which we have by\nnature the strongest desire; the love, the gratitude, the admiration of\nmankind. We become ambitious of performing the like; and thus naturally\nlay down to ourselves a rule of another kind, that every opportunity of\nacting in this manner is carefully to be sought after.\nIt is thus that the general rules of morality are formed. They are\nultimately founded upon experience of what, in particular instances, our\nmoral faculties, our natural sense of merit and propriety, approve, or\ndisapprove of. We do not originally approve or condemn particular\nactions; because, upon examination, they appear to be agreeable or\ninconsistent with a certain general rule. The general rule, on the\ncontrary, is formed by finding from experience, that all actions of a\ncertain kind, or circumstanced in a certain manner, are approved or\ndisapproved of. To the man who first saw an inhuman murder, committed\nfrom avarice, envy, or unjust resentment, and upon one too that loved\nand trusted the murderer, who beheld the last agonies of the dying\nperson, who heard him, with his expiring breath, complain more of the\nperfidy and ingratitude of his false friend, than of the violence which\nhad been done to him, there could be no occasion, in order to conceive\nhow horrible such an action was, that he should reflect, that one of the\nmost sacred rules of conduct was what prohibited the taking away the\nlife of an innocent person, that this was a plain violation of that\nrule, and consequently a very blamable action. His detestation of this\ncrime, it is evident, would arise instantaneously and antecedent to his\nhaving formed to himself any such general rule. The general rule, on the\ncontrary, which he might afterwards form, would be founded upon the\ndetestation which he felt necessarily arise in his own breast, at the\nthought of this, and every other particular action of the same kind.\nWhen we read in history or romance, the account of actions either of\ngenerosity or of baseness, the admiration which we conceive for the one,\nand the contempt which we feel for the other, neither of them arise from\nreflecting that there are certain general rules which declare all\nactions of the one kind admirable, and all actions of the other\ncontemptible. Those general rules, on the contrary, are all formed from\nthe experience we have had of the effects which actions of all different\nkinds naturally produce upon us.\nAn amiable action, a respectable action, an horrid action, are all of\nthem actions which naturally excite the love, the respect, or the horror\nof the spectator, for the person who performs them. The general rules\nwhich determine what actions are, and what are not, the objects of each\nof those sentiments, can be formed no other way than by observing what\nactions actually and in fact excite them.\nWhen these general rules, indeed, have been formed, when they are\nuniversally acknowledged and established, by the concurring sentiments\nof mankind, we frequently appeal to them as to the standards of\njudgment, in debating concerning the degree of praise or blame that is\ndue to certain actions of a complicated and dubious nature. They are\nupon these occasions commonly cited as the ultimate foundations of what\nis just and unjust in human conduct; and this circumstance seems to have\nmisled several very eminent authors, to draw up their systems in such a\nmanner, as if they had supposed that the original judgments of mankind\nwith regard to right and wrong, were formed like the decisions of a\ncourt of judicatory, by considering first the general rule, and then,\nsecondly, whether the particular action under consideration fell\nproperly within its comprehension.\nThose general rules of conduct, when they have been fixed in our mind by\nhabitual reflection, are of great use in correcting misrepresentations\nof self-love concerning what is fit and proper to be done in our\nparticular situation. The man of furious resentment, if he was to listen\nto the dictates of that passion, would perhaps regard the death of his\nenemy, as but a small compensation for the wrong, he imagines, he has\nreceived; which, however, may be no more than a very slight provocation.\nBut his observations upon the conduct of others, have taught him how\nhorrible all such sanguinary revenges appear. Unless his education has\nbeen very singular, he has laid it down to himself as an inviolable\nrule, to abstain from them upon all occasions. This rule preserves its\nauthority with him, and renders him incapable of being guilty of such a\nviolence. Yet the fury of his own temper may be such, that had this been\nthe first time in which he considered such an action, he would\nundoubtedly have determined it to be quite just and proper, and what\nevery impartial spectator would approve of. But that reverence for the\nrule which past experience has impressed upon him, checks the\nimpetuosity of his passion, and helps him to correct the too partial\nviews which self-love might otherwise suggest, of what was proper to be\ndone in his situation. If he should allow himself to be so far\ntransported by passion as to violate this rule, yet even in this case,\nhe cannot throw off altogether the awe and respect with which he has\nbeen accustomed to regard it. At the very time of acting, at the moment\nin which passion mounts the highest, he hesitates and trembles at the\nthought of what he is about to do: he is secretly conscious to himself\nthat he is breaking through those measures of conduct, which, in all his\ncool hours, he had resolved never to infringe, which he had never seen\ninfringed by others without the highest disapprobation, and of which the\ninfringement, his own mind forebodes, must soon render him the object of\nthe same disagreeable sentiments. Before he can take the last fatal\nresolution, he is tormented with all the agonies of doubt and\nuncertainty; he is terrified at the thought of violating so sacred a\nrule, and at the same time is urged and goaded on by the fury of his\ndesires to violate it. He changes his purpose every moment; sometimes he\nresolves to adhere to his principle, and not indulge a passion which may\ncorrupt the remaining part of his life with the horrors of shame and\nrepentance; and a momentary calm takes possession of his breast, from\nthe prospect of that security and tranquillity which he will enjoy when\nhe thus determines not to expose himself to the hazard of a contrary\nconduct. But immediately the passion rouses anew, and with fresh fury\ndrives him on to commit what he had the instant before resolved to\nabstain from. Wearied and distracted with those continual irresolutions,\nhe at length, from a sort of despair, makes the last fatal and\nirrecoverable step; but with that terror and amazement with which one\nflying from an enemy, throws himself over a precipice, where he is sure\nof meeting with more certain destruction than from any thing that\npursues him from behind. Such are his sentiments even at the time of\nacting; though he is then, no doubt, less sensible of the impropriety of\nhis own conduct than afterwards, when his passion being gratified and\npalled, he begins to view what he has done in the light in which others\nare apt to view it; and actually feels, what he had only foreseen very\nimperfectly before, the stings of remorse and repentance begin to\nagitate and torment him.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of the influence and authority of the general rules of morality, and\nthat they are justly regarded as the laws of the Deity._\nThe regard to those general rules of conduct, is what is properly called\na sense of duty, a principle of the greatest consequence in human life,\nand the only principle by which the bulk of mankind are capable of\ndirecting their actions. Many men behave very decently, and through the\nwhole of their lives avoid any considerable degree of blame, who yet,\nperhaps, never felt the sentiment upon the propriety of which we found\nour approbation of their conduct, but acted merely from a regard to what\nthey saw were the established rules of behaviour. The man who has\nreceived great benefits from another person, may, by the natural\ncoldness of his temper, feel but a very small degree of the sentiment of\ngratitude. If he has been virtuously educated, however, he will often\nhave been made to observe how odious those actions appear which denote a\nwant of this sentiment, and how amiable the contrary. Tho\u2019 his heart\ntherefore is not warmed with any grateful affection, he will strive to\nact as if it was, and will endeavour to pay all those regards and\nattentions to his patron which the liveliest gratitude could suggest. He\nwill visit him regularly; he will behave to him respectfully; he will\nnever talk of him but with expressions of the highest esteem, and of the\nmany obligations which he owes to him. And what is more, he will\ncarefully embrace every opportunity of making a proper return for past\nservices. He may do all this too without any hypocrisy or blamable\ndissimulation, without any selfish intention of obtaining new favours,\nand without any design of imposing either upon his benefactor or the\npublic. The motive of his actions may be no other than a reverence for\nthe established rule of duty, a serious and earnest desire of acting, in\nevery respect, according to the law of gratitude. A wife, in the same\nmanner, may sometimes not feel that tender regard for her husband which\nis suitable to the relation that subsists between them. If she has been\nvirtuously educated, however, she will endeavour to act as if she felt\nit, to be careful, officious, faithful, and sincere, and to be deficient\nin none of those attentions which the sentiment of conjugal affection\ncould have prompted her to perform. Such a friend, and such a wife, are\nneither of them, undoubtedly, the very best of their kinds; and though\nboth of them may have the most serious and earnest desire to fulfil\nevery part of their duty, yet they will fail in many nice and delicate\nregards, they will miss many opportunities of obliging, which they could\nnever have overlooked if they had possessed the sentiment that is proper\nto their situation. Though not the very first of their kinds, however,\nthey are perhaps the second; and if the regard to the general rules of\nconduct has been very strongly impressed upon them, neither of them will\nfail in any essential part of their duty. None but those of the happiest\nmould are capable of suiting, with exact justness, their sentiments and\nbehaviour to the smallest difference of situation, and of acting upon\nall occasions with the most delicate and accurate propriety. The coarse\nclay of which the bulk of mankind are formed, cannot be wrought up to\nsuch perfection. There is scarce any man, however, who by discipline,\neducation, and example, may not be impressed with a regard to general\nrules, as to act upon almost every occasion with tolerable decency, and\nthrough the whole of his life avoid any considerable degree of blame.\nWithout this sacred regard to general rules, there is no man whose\nconduct can be much depended upon. It is this which constitutes the most\nessential difference between a man of principle and honour and a\nworthless fellow. The one adheres, on all occasions, steadily and\nresolutely to his maxims, and preserves through the whole of his life\none even tenour of conduct. The other, acts variously and accidentally,\nas humour, inclination, or interest chance to be uppermost. Nay, such\nare the inequalities of humour to which all men are subject, that\nwithout this principle, the man who, in his cool hours, had the most\ndelicate sensibility to the propriety of conduct, might often be led to\nact absurdly upon the most frivolous occasions, and when it was scarce\npossible to assign any serious motive for his behaviour in this manner.\nYour friend makes you a visit when you happen to be in a humour which\nmakes it disagreeable to receive him: in your present mood this civility\nis very apt to appear an impertinent intrusion; and if you were to give\nway to the views of things which at this time occur, though civil in\nyour temper, you would behave to him with coldness and contempt. What\nrenders you incapable of such a rudeness, is nothing but a regard to the\ngeneral rules of civility and hospitality, which prohibit it. That\nhabitual reverence which your former experience has taught you for\nthese, enables you to act, upon all such occasions, with nearly equal\npropriety, and hinders those inequalities of temper, to which all men\nare subject, from influencing your conduct in any very sensible degree.\nBut if without regard to these general rules, even the duties of\npoliteness, which are so easily observed, and which can scarce have any\nserious motive to violate, would yet be so frequently violated, what\nwould become of the duties of justice, of truth, of chastity, of\nfidelity, which it is often so difficult to observe, and which there may\nbe so many strong motives to violate? But upon the tolerable observance\nof these duties, depends the very existence of human society, which\nwould crumble into nothing if mankind were not generally impressed with\na reverence for those important rules of conduct.\nThis reverence is still further enhanced by an opinion which is first\nimpressed by nature, and afterwards confirmed by reasoning and\nphilosophy, that those important rules of morality, are the commands and\nlaws of the Deity, who will finally reward the obedient, and punish the\ntransgressors of their duty.\nThis opinion or apprehension, I say, seems first to be impressed by\nnature. Men are naturally led to ascribe to those mysterious beings,\nwhatever they are, which happen, in any country, to be the objects of\nreligious fear, all their own sentiments and passions. They have no\nother, they can conceive no other to ascribe to them. Those unknown\nintelligences which they imagine but see not, must necessarily be formed\nwith some sort of resemblance to those intelligences of which they have\nexperience. During the ignorance and darkness of pagan superstition,\nmankind seem to have formed the ideas of their divinities with so little\ndelicacy, that they ascribed to them, indiscriminately, all the passions\nof human nature, those not excepted which do the least honour to our\nspecies, such as lust, hunger, avarice, envy, revenge. They could not\nfail therefore, to ascribe to those beings, for the excellence of whose\nnature they still conceived the highest admiration, those sentiments and\nqualities which are the great ornaments of humanity, and which seem to\nraise it to a resemblance of divine perfection, the love of virtue and\nbeneficence, and the abhorrence of vice and injustice. The man who was\ninjured, called upon Jupiter to be witness of the wrong that was done to\nhim, and could not doubt, but that divine being would behold it with the\nsame indignation which would animate the meanest of mankind, who looked\non when injustice was committed. The man who did the injury, felt\nhimself to be the proper object of detestation and resentment of\nmankind; and his natural fears led him to impute the same sentiments to\nthose awful beings, whose presence he could not avoid, and whose power\nhe could not resist. These natural hopes and fears, and suspicions, were\npropagated by sympathy, and confirmed by education; and the gods were\nuniversally represented and believed to be the rewarders of humanity and\nmercy, and the avengers of perfidy and injustice. And thus religion,\neven in its rudest form, gave a sanction to the rules of morality, long\nbefore the age of artificial reasoning and philosophy. That the terrors\nof religion should thus enforce the natural sense of duty, was of too\nmuch importance to the happiness of mankind, for nature to leave it\ndependent upon the slowness and uncertainty of philosophical researches.\nThese researches, however, when they came to take place, confirmed those\noriginal anticipations of nature. Upon whatever we suppose that our\nmoral faculties are founded, whether upon a certain modification of\nreason, upon an original instinct, called a moral sense, or upon some\nother principle of our nature, it cannot be doubted, that they were\ngiven us for the direction of our conduct in this life. They carry along\nwith them the most evident badges of this authority, which denote that\nthey were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our\nactions, to superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and to\njudge how far each of them was either to be indulged or restrained. Our\nmoral faculties are by no means, as some have pretended, upon a level in\nthis respect with the other faculties and appetites of our nature,\nendowed with no more right to restrain these last, than these last are\nto restrain them. No other faculty or principle of action judges of any\nother. Love does not judge of resentment, nor resentment of love. Those\ntwo passions may be opposite to one another, but cannot, with any\npropriety, be said to approve or disapprove of one another. But it is\nthe peculiar office of those faculties now under our consideration to\njudge, to bestow censure or applause upon all the other principles of\nour nature. They may be considered as a sort of senses of which those\nprinciples are the objects. Every sense is supreme over its own objects.\nThere is no appeal from the eye with regard to the beauty of colours,\nnor from the ear with regard to the harmony of sounds, nor from the\ntaste with regard to the agreeableness of flavours. Each of those senses\njudges in the last resort of its own objects. Whatever gratifies the\ntaste is sweet, whatever pleases the eye is beautiful, whatever sooths\nthe ear is harmonious. The very essence of each of those qualities\nconsists in being fitted to please the sense to which it is addressed.\nIt belongs to our moral faculties, in the same manner to determine when\nthe ear ought to be soothed, when the eye ought to be indulged, when the\ntaste ought to be gratified, when and how far every other principle of\nour nature ought to be indulged or restrained. What is agreeable to our\nmoral faculties, is fit, and right, and proper to be done; the contrary\nwrong, unfit, and improper. The sentiments which they approve of, are\ngraceful and unbecoming. The very words, right, wrong, fit, improper,\ngraceful, unbecoming, mean only what pleases or displeases those\nfaculties.\nSince these, therefore, were plainly intended to be the governing\nprinciples of human nature, the rules which they prescribe, are to be\nregarded as the commands and laws of the Deity, promulgated by those\nvicegerents which he has thus set up within us. All general rules are\ncommonly denominated laws: thus the general rules which bodies observe\nin the communication of motion, are called the laws of motion. But those\ngeneral rules which our moral faculties observe in approving or\ncondemning whatever sentiment or action is subjected to their\nexamination, may much more justly be denominated such. They have a much\ngreater resemblance to what are properly called laws, those general\nrules which the sovereign lays down to direct the conduct of his\nsubjects. Like them they are rules to direct the free actions of men:\nthey are prescribed most surely by a lawful superior, and are attended\nto in the sanction of rewards and punishments. Those vicegerents of God\nwithin us, never fail to punish the violation of them, by the torments\nof inward shame, and self-condemnation; and on the contrary, always\nreward obedience with tranquillity of mind, with contentment, and\nself-satisfaction.\nThere are innumerable other considerations which serve to confirm the\nsame conclusion. The happiness of mankind, as well as of all other\nrational creatures, seems to have been the original purpose intended by\nthe Author of nature, when he brought them into existence. No other end\nseems worthy of that supreme wisdom and divine benignity which we\nnecessarily ascribe to him; and this opinion, which we are led to by the\nabstract consideration of his infinite perfections, is still more\nconfirmed by the examination of the works of nature, which seem all\nintended to promote happiness, and to guard against misery. But by\nacting according to the dictates of our moral faculties, we necessarily\npursue the most effectual means for promoting the happiness of mankind,\nand may therefore be said, in some sense, to co-operate with the Deity,\nand to advance as far as in our power the plan of Providence. By acting\notherways, on the contrary, we seem to obstruct, in some measure, the\nscheme which the Author of nature has established for the happiness and\nperfection of the world, and to declare ourselves, if I may say so, in\nsome measure the enemies of God. Hence we are naturally encouraged to\nhope for his extraordinary favour and reward in the one case, and to\ndread his vengeance and punishment in the other.\nThere are besides many other reasons, and many other natural principles,\nwhich all tend to confirm and inculcate the same salutary doctrine. If\nwe consider the general rules by which external prosperity and adversity\nare commonly distributed in this life, we shall find, that\nnotwithstanding the disorder in which all things appear to be in this\nworld, yet even here every virtue naturally meets with its proper\nreward, with the recompense which is most fit to encourage and promote\nit; and this too so surely, that it requires a very extraordinary\nconcurrence of circumstances entirely to disappoint it. What is the\nreward most proper for encouraging industry, prudence, and\ncircumspection? Success in every sort of business. And is it possible\nthat in the whole of life these virtues should fail of attaining it?\nWealth and external honours are their proper recompense, and the\nrecompense which they can seldom fail of acquiring. What reward is most\nproper for promoting the practice of truth, justice, and humanity? The\nconfidence, the esteem, and love of those we live with. Humanity does\nnot desire to be great, but to be beloved. It is not in being rich that\ntruth and justice would rejoice, but in being trusted and believed,\nrecompenses which those virtues must almost always acquire. By some very\nextraordinary and unlucky circumstance, a good man may come to be\nsuspected of a crime of which he was altogether incapable, and upon that\naccount be most unjustly exposed for the remaining part of his life to\nthe horror and aversion of mankind. By an accident of this kind he may\nbe said to lose his all, notwithstanding his integrity and justice; in\nthe same manner as a cautious man, notwithstanding his utmost\ncircumspection, may be ruined by an earthquake or an inundation.\nAccidents of the first kind, however, are perhaps still more rare, and\nstill more contrary to the common course of things than those of the\nsecond; and still it remains true, that the practice of truth, justice,\nand humanity, is a certain and almost infallible method of acquiring\nwhat those virtues chiefly aim at, the confidence and love of those we\nlive with. A person may be very easily misrepresented with regard to a\nparticular action; but it is scarce possible that he should be so with\nregard to the general tenor of his conduct. An innocent man may be\nbelieved to have done wrong: this, however, will rarely happen. On the\ncontrary, the established opinion of the innocence of his manners, will\noften lead us to absolve him where he has really been in the fault,\nnotwithstanding very strong presumptions. A knave, in the same manner\nmay escape censure, or even meet applause, for a particular knavery, in\nwhich his conduct is not understood. But no man was ever habitually\nsuch, without being almost universally known to be so, and without being\neven frequently suspected of guilt, when he was in reality perfectly\ninnocent. And so far as vice and virtue can be either punished or\nrewarded by the sentiments and opinions of mankind, they both, according\nto the common course of things, meet even here with something more than\nexact and impartial justice.\nBut though the general rules by which prosperity and adversity are\ncommonly distributed, when considered in this cool and philosophical\nlight, appear to be perfectly suited to the situation of mankind in this\nlife, yet they are by no means suited to some of our natural sentiments.\nOur natural love and admiration for some virtues is such, that we should\nwish to bestow on them all sorts of honours and rewards, even those\nwhich we must acknowledge to be the proper recompenses of other\nqualities with which those virtues are not always accompanied. Our\ndetestation, on the contrary, for some vices is such, that we should\ndesire to heap upon them every sort of disgrace and disaster, those not\nexcepted which are the natural consequences of very different qualities.\nMagnanimity, generosity, and justice command so high a degree of\nadmiration, that we desire to see them crowned with wealth, and power,\nand honours of every kind, the natural consequences of prudence,\nindustry, and application; qualities with which those virtues are not\ninseparably connected. Fraud, falsehood, brutality, and violence, on the\nother hand, excite in every human breast such scorn and abhorrence, that\nour indignation rouses to see them possess those advantages which they\nmay in some sense be said to have merited, by the diligence and industry\nwith which they are sometimes attended. The industrious knave cultivates\nthe soil; the indolent good man leaves it uncultivated. Who ought to\nreap the harvest? Who starve, and who live in plenty? The natural course\nof things decides it in favour of the knave: the natural sentiments of\nmankind in favour of the man of virtue. Man judges, that the good\nqualities of the one are greatly over-recompensed by those advantages\nwhich they tend to procure him, and that the omissions of the other are\nby far too severely punished by the distress which they naturally bring\nupon him; and human laws, the consequences of human sentiments, forfeit\nthe life and the estate of the industrious and cautious traitor, and\nreward, by extraordinary recompenses, the fidelity and public spirit of\nthe improvident and careless good citizen. Thus man is by Nature\ndirected to correct, in some measure, that distribution of things which\nshe herself would otherwise have made. The rules which for this purpose\nshe prompts him to follow, are different from those which she herself\nobserves. She bestows upon every virtue, and upon every vice, that\nprecise reward or punishment which is best fitted to encourage the one,\nor to restrain the other. She is directed by this sole consideration,\nand pays little regard to the different degrees of merit and demerit,\nwhich they may seem to possess in the sentiments and passions of man.\nMan, on the contrary, pays regard to this only, and would endeavour to\nrender the state of every virtue precisely proportioned to that degree\nof love and esteem, and of every vice to that degree of contempt and\nabhorrence, which he himself conceives for it. The rules which she\nfollows are fit for her, those which he follows for him: but both are\ncalculated to promote the same great end, the order of the world, and\nthe perfection and happiness of human nature.\nBut though man is thus employed to alter that distribution of things\nwhich natural events would make, if left to themselves; though, like the\ngods of the poets, he is perpetually interposing, by extraordinary\nmeans, in favour of virtue, and in opposition to vice, and like them,\nendeavours to turn away the arrow that is aimed at the head of the\nrighteous, but accelerates the sword of destruction that is lifted up\nagainst the wicked; yet he is by no means able to render the fortune of\neither quite suitable to his own sentiments and wishes. The natural\ncourse of things cannot be entirely controuled by the impotent\nendeavours of man: the current is too rapid and too strong for him to\nstop it; and though the rules which direct it appear to have been\nestablished for the wisest and best purposes, they sometimes produce\neffects which shock all his natural sentiments. That a great combination\nof men, should prevail over a small one; that those who engage in an\nenterprise with fore-thought and all necessary preparation, should\nprevail over such as oppose them without any; and that every end should\nbe acquired by those means only which Nature has established for\nacquiring it, seems to be a rule not only necessary and unavoidable in\nitself, but even useful and proper for rousing the industry and\nattention of mankind. Yet, when, in consequence of this rule, violence\nand artifice prevail over sincerity and justice, what indignation does\nit not excite in the breast of every humane spectator? What sorrow and\ncompassion for the sufferings of the innocent, and what furious\nresentment against the success of the oppressor? We are equally grieved\nand enraged, at the wrong that is done, but often find it altogether out\nof our power to redress it. When we thus despair of finding any force\nupon earth which can check the triumph of injustice, we naturally appeal\nto Heaven, and hope, that the great Author of our nature will himself\nexecute hereafter, what all the principles which he has given us for the\ndirection of our conduct, prompt us to attempt even here; that he will\ncomplete the plan which he himself has thus taught us to begin; and\nwill, in a life to come, render to every one according to the works\nwhich he has performed in this world. And thus we are led to the belief\nof a future state, not only by the weaknesses, by the hopes and fears of\nhuman nature, but by the noblest and best principles which belong to it,\nby the love of virtue, and by the abhorrence of vice and injustice.\n\u201cDoes it suit the greatness of God,\u201d says the eloquent and philosophical\nbishop of Clermont, with that passionate and exaggerating force of\nimagination, which seems sometimes to exceed the bounds of decorum;\n\u201cdoes it suit the greatness of God, to leave the world which he has\ncreated in so universal a disorder? To see the wicked prevail almost\nalways over the just; the innocent dethroned by the usurper; the father\nbecome the victim of the ambition of an unnatural son; the husband\nexpiring under the stroke of a barbarous and faithless wife? From the\nheight of his greatness ought God to behold those melancholy events as a\nfantastical amusement, without taking any share in them? Because he is\ngreat, should he be weak, or unjust, or barbarous? Because men are\nlittle, ought they to be allowed either to be dissolute without\npunishment, or virtuous without reward? O God! if this is the character\nof your Supreme Being; if it is you whom we adore under such dreadful\nideas; I can no longer acknowledge you for my father, for my protector,\nfor the comforter of my sorrow, the support of my weakness, the rewarder\nof my fidelity. You would then be no more than an indolent and\nfantastical tyrant, who sacrifices mankind to his insolent vanity, and\nwho has brought them out of nothing, only to make them serve for the\nsport of his leisure, and of his caprice.\u201d\nWhen the general rules which determine the merit and demerit of actions,\ncome thus to be regarded, as the laws of an All-powerful Being, who\nwatches over our conduct, and who, in a life to come, will reward the\nobservance, and punish the breach of them; they necessarily acquire a\nnew sacredness from this consideration. That our regard to the will of\nthe Deity, ought to be the supreme rule of our conduct, can be doubted\nof by no body who believes his existence. The very thought of\ndisobedience appears to involve in it the most shocking impropriety. How\nvain, how absurd would it be for man, either to oppose or to neglect the\ncommands that were laid upon him by Infinite Wisdom, and Infinite Power!\nHow unnatural, how impiously ungrateful not to reverence the precepts\nthat were prescribed to him by the infinite goodness of his Creator,\neven though no punishment was to follow their violation. The sense of\npropriety too is here well supported by the strongest motives of\nself-interest. The idea that, however we may escape the observation of\nman, or be placed above the reach of human punishment, yet we are always\nacting under the eye, and exposed to the punishment of God, the great\navenger of injustice, is a motive capable of restraining the most\nheadstrong passions, with those at least who, by constant reflection,\nhave rendered it familiar to them.\nIt is in this manner that religion enforces the natural sense of duty:\nand hence it is, that mankind are generally disposed to place great\nconfidence in the probity of those who seem deeply impressed with\nreligious sentiments. Such persons, they imagine, act under an\nadditional tye, besides those which regulate the conduct of other men.\nThe regard to the propriety of action as well as to reputation, the\nregard to the applause of his own breast, as well as that of others, are\nmotives which they suppose have the same influence over the religious\nman, as over the man of the world. But the former lies under another\nrestraint, and never acts deliberately but as in the presence of that\nGreat Superior who is finally to recompense him according to his deeds.\nA greater trust is reposed, upon this account, in the regularity and\nexactness of his conduct. And wherever the natural principles of\nreligion are not corrupted by the factious and party zeal of some\nworthless cabal; wherever the first duty which it requires, is to fulfil\nall the obligations of morality; wherever men are not taught to regard\nfrivolous observances, as more immediate duties of religion, than acts\nof justice and beneficence; and to imagine, that by sacrifices, and\nceremonies, and vain supplications, they can bargain with the Deity for\nfraud, and perfidy, and violence, the world undoubtedly judges right in\nthis respect, and justly places a double confidence in the rectitude of\nthe religious man\u2019s behaviour.\nCHAP. IV.\n_In what cases the sense of duty ought to be the sole principle of our\nconduct; and in what cases it ought to concur with other motives._\nReligion affords such strong motives to the practice of virtue, and\nguards us by such powerful restraints from the temptations of vice, that\nmany have been led to suppose, that religious principles were the sole\nlaudable motives of action. We ought neither, they said, to reward from\ngratitude, nor punish from resentment; we ought neither to protect the\nhelplessness of our children, nor afford support to the infirmities of\nour parents, from natural affection. All affections for particular\nobjects, ought to be extinguished in our breast, and one great affection\ntake the place of all others, the love of the Deity, the desire of\nrendering ourselves agreeable to him, and of directing our conduct in\nevery respect according to his will. We ought not to be grateful from\ngratitude, we ought not to be charitable from humanity, we ought not to\nbe public-spirited from the love of our country, nor generous and just\nfrom the love of mankind. The sole principle and motive of our conduct\nin the performance of all those different duties, ought to be a sense\nthat God has commanded us to perform them. I shall not at present take\ntime to examine this opinion particularly; I shall only observe, that we\nshould not have expected to have found it entertained by any sect, who\nprofessed themselves of a religion in which, as it is the first precept\nto love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with\nall our strength, so it is the second to love our neighbour as we love\nourselves; and we love ourselves surely for our own sakes, and not\nmerely because we are commanded to do so. That the sense of duty should\nbe the sole principle of our conduct, is no where the precept of\nChristianity; but that it should be the ruling and governing one, as\nphilosophy, and as, indeed, common sense directs. It may be a question\nhowever, in what cases our actions ought to arise chiefly or entirely\nfrom a sense of duty, or from a regard to general rules; and in what\ncases some other sentiment or affection ought to concur, and have a\nprincipal influence.\nThe decision of this question, which cannot, perhaps, be given with any\nvery great accuracy, will depend upon two different circumstances;\nfirst, upon the natural agreeableness or deformity of the sentiment or\naffection which would prompt us to any action independent of all regard\nto general rules; and secondly, upon the precision and exactness, or the\nlooseness and inaccuracy of the general rules themselves.\nI. First, I say, it will depend upon the natural agreeableness or\ndeformity of the affection itself, how far our actions ought to arise\nfrom it, or entirely proceed from a regard to the general rule.\nAll those graceful and admired actions, to which the benevolent\naffections would prompt us, ought to proceed as much from the passions\nthemselves, as from any regard to the general rules of conduct. A\nbenefactor thinks himself but ill requited, if the person upon whom he\nhas bestowed his good offices, repays them merely from a cold sense of\nduty, and without any affection to his person. A husband is dissatisfied\nwith the most obedient wife, when he imagines her conduct is animated by\nno other principle besides her regard to what the relation she stands in\nrequires. Though a son should fail in none of the offices of filial\nduty, yet if he wants that affectionate reverence which it so well\nbecomes him to feel, the parent may justly complain of his indifference.\nNor could a son be quite satisfied with a parent who, though he\nperformed all the duties of his situation, had nothing of that fatherly\nfondness which might have been expected from him. With regard to all\nsuch benevolent and social affections, it is agreeable to see the sense\nof duty employed rather to restrain than to enliven them, rather to\nhinder us from doing too much, than to prompt us to do what we ought. It\ngives us pleasure to see a father obliged to check his own fondness, a\nfriend obliged to set bounds to his natural generosity, a person who has\nreceived a benefit, obliged to restrain the too sanguine gratitude of\nhis own temper.\nThe contrary maxim takes place with regard to the malevolent and\nunsocial passions. We ought to reward from the gratitude and generosity\nof our own hearts, without any reluctance, and without being obliged to\nreflect how great the propriety of rewarding: but we ought always to\npunish with reluctance, and more from a sense of the propriety of\npunishing than from any savage disposition to revenge. Nothing is more\ngraceful than the behaviour of the man who appears to resent the\ngreatest injuries, more from a sense that they deserve, and are the\nproper objects of resentment, than from feeling himself the furies of\nthat disagreeable passion; who, like a judge, considers only the general\nrule, which determines what vengeance is due for each particular\noffence; who, in executing that rule, feels less for what himself has\nsuffered, than what the offender is about to suffer; who, though in\nwrath remembers mercy, and is disposed to interpret the rule in the most\ngentle and favourable manner, and to allow all the alleviations which\nthe most candid humanity could, consistently with good sense, admit of.\nAs the selfish passions, according to what has formerly been observed,\nhold in other respects a sort of middle place, between the social and\nunsocial affections, so do they likewise in this. The pursuit of the\nobjects of private interest, in all common, little, and ordinary cases,\nought to flow rather from a regard to the general rules which prescribe\nsuch conduct, than from any passion for the objects themselves; but upon\nmore important and extraordinary occasions, we should be awkward,\ninsipid, and ungraceful, if the objects themselves did not appear to\nanimate us with a considerable degree of passion. To be anxious, or to\nbe laying a plot either to gain or to save a single shilling, would\ndegrade the most vulgar tradesman in the opinion of all his neighbours.\nLet his circumstances be ever so mean, no attention to any such small\nmatters, for the sake of the things themselves, must appear in his\nconduct. His situation may require the most severe \u0153conomy, and the most\nexact assiduity: but each particular exertion of that \u0153conomy and\nassiduity must proceed not so much from a regard for that particular\nsaving or gain, as for the general rule which to him prescribes, with\nthe utmost rigour, such a tenour of conduct. His parsimony to-day must\nnot arise from a desire of the particular three-pence which he will save\nby it, nor his attendance in his shop from a passion for the particular\nten-pence which he will acquire by it: both the one and the other ought\nto proceed solely from a regard to the general rule, which prescribes,\nwith the most unrelenting severity, this plan of conduct to all persons\nin his way of life. In this consists the difference between the\ncharacter of a miser, and that of a person of exact \u0153conomy and\nassiduity. The one is anxious about small matters for their own sake;\nthe other attends to them only in consequence of the scheme of life\nwhich he has laid down to himself.\nIt is quite otherwise with regard to the more extraordinary and\nimportant objects of self-interest. A person appears mean-spirited, who\ndoes not pursue these with some degree of earnestness for their own\nsake. We should despise a prince who was not anxious about conquering or\ndefending a province. We should have little respect for a private\ngentleman who did not exert himself to gain an estate, or even a\nconsiderable office, when he could acquire them without either meanness\nor injustice. A member of parliament who shews no keenness about his own\nelection, is abandoned by his friends, as altogether unworthy of their\nattachment. Even a tradesman is thought a poor-spirited fellow among his\nneighbours, who does not bestir himself to get what they call an\nextraordinary job, or some uncommon advantage. This spirit and keenness\nconstitutes the difference between the man of enterprise and the man of\ndull regularity. Those great objects of self-interest, of which the loss\nor acquisition quite changes the rank of the person, are the objects of\nthe passion properly called ambition; a passion, which when it keeps\nwithin the bounds of prudence and justice, is always admired in the\nworld, and has even sometimes a certain irregular greatness, which\ndazzles the imagination, when it passes the limits of both these\nvirtues, and is not only unjust but extravagant. Hence the general\nadmiration for Heroes and Conquerors, and even for Statesmen, whose\nprojects have been very daring and extensive, though altogether devoid\nof justice; such as those of the Cardinals of Richlieu and of Retz. The\nobjects of avarice and ambition differ only in their greatness. A miser\nis as furious about a halfpenny, as a man of ambition about the conquest\nof a kingdom.\nII. Secondly, I say, it will depend partly upon the precision and\nexactness, or the looseness and inaccuracy of the general rules\nthemselves, how far our conduct ought to proceed entirely from a regard\nto them.\nThe general rules of almost all the virtues, the general rules which\ndetermine what are the offices of prudence, of charity, of generosity,\nof gratitude, of friendship, are in many respects loose and inaccurate,\nadmit of many exceptions, and require so many modifications, that it is\nscarce possible to regulate our conduct entirely by a regard to them.\nThe common proverbial maxims of prudence, being founded in universal\nexperience, are perhaps the best general rules which can be given about\nit. To affect, however, a very strict and literal adherence to them\nwould evidently be the most absurd and ridiculous pedantry. Of all the\nvirtues I have just now mentioned, gratitude is that, perhaps, of which\nthe rules are the most precise, and admit of the fewest exceptions. That\nas soon as we can we should make a return of equal, and if possible of\nsuperior value to the services we have received, would seem to be a\npretty plain rule, and one which admitted of scarce any exceptions. Upon\nthe most superficial examination, however, this rule will appear to be\nin the highest degree loose and inaccurate, and to admit of ten thousand\nexceptions. If your benefactor attended you in your sickness, ought you\nto attend him in his? or can you fulfil the obligation of gratitude, by\nmaking a return of a different kind? If you ought to attend him, how\nlong ought you to attend him? The same time which he attended you, or\nlonger, and how much longer? If your friend lent you money in your\ndistress, ought you to lend him money in his? How much ought you to lend\nhim? When ought you to lend him? Now, or to-morrow, or next month? And\nfor how long a time? It is evident, that no general rule can be laid\ndown, by which a precise answer can, in all cases, be given to any of\nthese questions. The difference between his character and yours, between\nhis circumstances and yours, may be such, that you may be perfectly\ngrateful, and justly refuse to lend him a halfpenny: and, on the\ncontrary, you may be willing to lend, or even to give him ten times the\nsum which he lent you, and yet justly be accused of the blackest\ningratitude, and of not having fulfilled the hundredth part of the\nobligation you lie under. As the duties of gratitude, however, are\nperhaps the most sacred of all those which the beneficent virtues\nprescribe to us, so the general rules which determine them are, as I\nsaid before, the most accurate. Those which ascertain the actions\nrequired by friendship, humanity, hospitality, generosity, are still\nmore vague and indeterminate.\nThere is, however, one virtue of which the general rules determine with\nthe greatest exactness every external action which it requires. This\nvirtue is justice. The rules of justice are accurate in the highest\ndegree, and admit of no exceptions or modifications, but such as may be\nascertained as accurately as the rules themselves, and which generally,\nindeed, flow from the very same principles with them. If I owe a man ten\npounds, justice requires that I should precisely pay him ten pounds,\neither at the time agreed upon, or when he demands it. What I ought to\nperform, how much I ought to perform, when and where I ought to perform\nit, the whole nature and circumstances of the action prescribed, are all\nof them precisely fixt and determined. Though it may be awkward and\npedantic, therefore, to affect too strict an adherence to the common\nrules of prudence or generosity, there is no pedantry in sticking fast\nby the rules of justice. On the contrary, the most sacred regard is due\nto them; and the actions which this virtue requires are never so\nproperly performed, as when the chief motive for performing them is a\nreverential and religious regard to those general rules which require\nthem. In the practice of the other virtues, our conduct should rather be\ndirected by a certain idea of propriety, by a certain taste for a\nparticular tenour of conduct, than by any regard to a precise maxim or\nrule; and we should consider the end and foundation of the rule, more\nthan the rule itself. But it is otherwise with regard to justice: the\nman who in that refines the least, and adheres with the most obstinate\nstedfastness, to the general rules themselves, is the most commendable,\nand the most to be depended upon. Though the end of the rules of justice\nbe, to hinder us from hurting our neighbour, it may frequently be a\ncrime to violate them, though we could pretend, with some pretext of\nreason, that this particular violation could do no hurt. A man often\nbecomes a villain the moment he begins even in his own heart, to chicane\nin this manner. The moment he thinks of departing from the most staunch\nand positive adherence to what those inviolable precepts prescribe to\nhim, he is no longer to be trusted, and no man can say what degree of\nguilt he may not arrive at. The thief imagines he does no evil, when he\nsteals from the rich, what he supposes they may easily want, and what\npossibly they may never even know has been stolen from them. The\nadulterer imagines he does no evil, when he corrupts the wife of his\nfriend, provided he covers his intrigue from the suspicion of the\nhusband, and does not disturb the peace of the family. When once we\nbegin to give way to such refinements, there is no enormity so gross of\nwhich we may not be capable.\nThe rules of justice may be compared to the rules of grammar; the rules\nof the other virtues to the rules which critics lay down for the\nattainment of what is sublime and elegant in composition. The one, are\nprecise, accurate, and indispensable. The other, are loose, vague, and\nindeterminate, and present us rather with a general idea of the\nperfection we ought to aim at, than afford us any certain and infallible\ndirections for acquiring it. A man may learn to write grammatically by\nrule, with the most absolute infallibility; and so, perhaps, he may be\ntaught to act justly. But there are no rules whose observance will\ninfallibly lead us to the attainment of elegance or sublimity in\nwriting, though there are some which may help us, in some measure, to\ncorrect and ascertain the vague ideas which we might otherwise have\nentertained of those perfections: and there are no rules by the\nknowledge of which we can infallibly be taught to act upon all occasions\nwith prudence, with just magnanimity, or proper beneficence. Though\nthere are some which may enable us to correct and ascertain in several\nrespects, the imperfect ideas which we might otherwise have entertained\nof those virtues.\nIt may sometimes happen, that with the most serious and earnest desire\nof acting so as to deserve approbation, we may mistake the proper rules\nof conduct, and thus be misled by that very principle which ought to\ndirect us. It is in vain to expect, that in this case mankind should\nentirely approve of our behaviour. They cannot enter into that absurd\nidea of duty which influenced us, nor go along with any of the actions\nwhich follow from it. There is still, however, something respectable in\nthe character and behaviour of one who is thus betrayed into vice, by a\nwrong sense of duty, or by what is called an erroneous conscience. How\nfatally soever he may be misled by it, he is still, with the generous\nand humane, more the object of commiseration than of hatred or\nresentment. They lament the weakness of human nature, which exposes us\nto such unhappy delusions, even while we are most sincerely labouring\nafter perfection, and endeavouring to act according to the best\nprinciple which can possibly direct us. False notions of religion are\nalmost the only causes which can occasion any very gross perversion of\nour natural sentiments in this way; and that principle which gives the\ngreatest authority to the rules of duty, is alone capable of distorting\nour ideas of them in any considerable degree. In all other cases common\nsense is sufficient to direct us, if not to the most exquisite propriety\nof conduct, yet to something which is not very far from it; and provided\nwe are in earnest desirous to do well, our behaviour will always, upon\nthe whole, be praise-worthy. That to obey the will of the Deity, is the\nfirst rule of duty, all men are agreed. But concerning the particular\ncommandments which that will may impose upon us, they differ widely from\none another. In this, therefore, the greatest mutual forbearance and\ntoleration is due; and though the defence of society requires that\ncrimes should be punished, from whatever motives they proceed, yet a\ngood man will always punish them with reluctance, when they evidently\nproceed from false notions of religious duty. He will never feel against\nthose who commit them that indignation which he feels against other\ncriminals, but will rather regret, and sometimes even admire their\nunfortunate firmness and magnanimity, at the very time that he punishes\ntheir crime. In the tragedy of Mahomet, one of the finest of Mr.\nVoltaire\u2019s, it is well represented, what ought to be our sentiments for\ncrimes which proceed from such motives. In that tragedy, two young\npeople of different sexes, of the most innocent and virtuous\ndispositions, and without any other weakness except what endears them\nthe more to us, a mutual fondness for one another, are instigated by the\nstrongest motives of a false religion, to commit a horrid murder, that\nshocks all the principles of human nature: a venerable old man, who had\nexpressed the most tender affection for them both, for whom,\nnotwithstanding he was the avowed enemy of their religion, they had both\nconceived the highest reverence and esteem, and who was in reality their\nfather, though they did not know him to be such, is pointed out to them\nas a sacrifice which God had expressly required at their hands, and they\nare commanded to kill him. While they are about executing this crime,\nthey are tortured with all the agonies which can arise from the struggle\nbetween the idea of the indispensableness of religious duty on the one\nside, and compassion, gratitude, reverence for the age, and love for the\nhumanity and virtue of the person whom they are going to destroy, on the\nother. The representation of this exhibits one of the most interesting,\nand perhaps the most instructive spectacle that was ever introduced upon\nany theatre. The sense of duty, however, at last prevails over all the\namiable weaknesses of human nature. They execute the crime imposed upon\nthem; but immediately discover their error, and the fraud which had\ndeceived them, and are distracted with horror, remorse, and resentment.\nSuch as are our sentiments for the unhappy Seid and Palmira, such ought\nwe to feel for every person who is in this manner misled by religion,\nwhen we are sure that it is really religion which misleads him, and not\nthe pretence of it, which is made a cover to some of the worst of human\npassions.\nAs a person may act wrong by following a wrong sense of duty, so nature\nmay sometimes prevail, and lead him to act right in opposition to it. We\ncannot in this case be displeased to see that motive prevail, which we\nthink ought to prevail, though the person himself is so weak as to think\notherwise. As his conduct, however, is the effect of weakness, not\nprinciple, we are far from bestowing upon it any thing that approaches\nto complete approbation. A bigotted Roman Catholic, who, during the\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew, had been so overcome by compassion, as to\nsave some unhappy protestants, whom he thought it his duty to destroy,\nwould not seem to be entitled to that high applause which we should have\nbestowed upon him, had he exerted the same generosity with complete\nself-approbation. We might be pleased with the humanity of his temper,\nbut we should still regard him with a sort of pity which is altogether\ninconsistent with the admiration that is due to perfect virtue. It is\nthe same case with all the other passions. We do not dislike to see them\nexert themselves properly, even when a false notion of duty would direct\nthe person to restrain them. A very devout Quaker, who upon being struck\nupon one cheek, instead of turning up the other, should so far forget\nhis literal interpretation of our Saviour\u2019s precept, as to bestow some\ngood discipline upon the brute that insulted him, would not be\ndisagreeable to us. We should laugh and be diverted with his spirit, and\nrather like him the better for it. But we should by no means regard him\nwith that respect and esteem which would seem due to one who, upon a\nlike occasion, had acted properly from a just sense of what was proper\nto be done. No action can properly be called virtuous, which is not\naccompanied with the sentiment of self-approbation.\n[Illustration]\nPART IV.\nOf the EFFECT of UTILITY upon the sentiment of approbation.\nCONSISTING OF ONE SECTION.\nCHAP. I.\n_Of the beauty which the appearance of_ UTILITY _bestows upon all the\nproductions of art, and of the extensive influence of this species of\nbeauty_.\nThat utility is one of the principal sources of beauty has been observed\nby every body, who has considered with any attention what constitutes\nthe nature of beauty. The conveniency of a house gives pleasure to the\nspectator as well as its regularity, and he is as much hurt when he\nobserves the contrary defect, as when he sees the correspondent windows\nof different forms, or the door not placed exactly in the middle of the\nbuilding. That the fitness of any system or machine to produce the end\nfor which it was intended, bestows a certain propriety and beauty upon\nthe whole, and renders the very thought and contemplation of it\nagreeable, is so very obvious that nobody has overlooked it.\nThe cause too, why utility pleases, has of late been assigned by an\ningenious and agreeable philosopher, who joins the greatest depth of\nthought to the greatest elegance of expression, and possesses the\nsingular and happy talent of treating the abstrusest subjects not only\nwith the most perfect perspicuity, but with the most lively eloquence.\nThe utility of any object, according to him, pleases the master by\nperpetually suggesting to him the pleasure or conveniency which it is\nfitted to promote. Every time he looks at it, he is put in mind of this\npleasure; and the object in this manner becomes a source of perpetual\nsatisfaction and enjoyment. The spectator enters by sympathy into the\nsentiments of the master, and necessarily views the object under the\nsame agreeable aspect. When we visit the palaces of the great, we cannot\nhelp conceiving the satisfaction we should enjoy if we ourselves were\nthe masters, and were possessed of so much artful and ingeniously\ncontrived accommodation. A similar account is given why the appearance\nof inconveniency should render any object disagreeable both to the owner\nand to the spectator.\nBut that this fitness, this happy contrivance of any production of art,\nshould often be more valued, than the very end for which it was\nintended; and that the exact adjustment of the means for attaining any\nconveniency or pleasure, should frequently be more regarded, than that\nvery conveniency or pleasure, in the attainment of which their whole\nmerit would seem to consist, has not, so far as I know, been yet taken\nnotice of by any body. That this however is very frequently the case,\nmay be observed in a thousand instances, both in the most frivolous and\nin the most important concerns of human life.\nWhen a person comes into his chamber, and finds the chairs all standing\nin the middle of the room, he is angry with his servant, and rather than\nsee them continue in that disorder, perhaps takes the trouble himself to\nset them all in their places with their backs to the wall. The whole\npropriety of this new situation arises from its superior conveniency in\nleaving the floor free and disengaged. To attain this conveniency he\nvoluntarily puts himself to more trouble than all he could have suffered\nfrom the want of it; since nothing was more easy, than to have set\nhimself down upon one of them, which is probably what he does when his\nlabour is over. What he wanted therefore, it seems, was not so much this\nconveniency, as that arrangement of things which promotes it. Yet it is\nthis conveniency which ultimately recommends that arrangement, and\nbestows upon it the whole of its propriety and beauty.\nA watch, in the same manner, that falls behind above two minutes in a\nday, is despised by one curious in watches. He sells it perhaps for a\ncouple of guineas, and purchases another at fifty, which will not lose\nabove a minute in a fortnight. The sole use of watches however, is to\ntell us what o\u2019clock it is, and to hinder us from breaking any\nengagement, or suffering any other inconveniency by our ignorance in\nthat particular point. But the person so nice with regard to this\nmachine, will not always be found either more scrupulously punctual than\nother men, or more anxiously concerned upon any other account, to know\nprecisely what time of day it is. What interests him is not so much the\nattainment of this piece of knowledge, as the perfection of the machine\nwhich serves to attain it.\nHow many people ruin themselves by laying out money on trinkets of\nfrivolous utility? What pleases these lovers of toys is not so much the\nutility, as the aptness of the machines which are fitted to promote it.\nAll their pockets are fluffed with little conveniencies. They contrive\nnew pockets, unknown in the clothes of other people, in order to carry a\ngreater number. They walk about loaded with a multitude of baubles, in\nweight and sometimes in value not inferior to an ordinary Jew\u2019s-box,\nsome of which may sometimes be of some little use, but all of which\nmight at all times be very well spared, and of which the whole utility\nis certainly not worth the fatigue of bearing the burden.\nNor is it only with regard to such frivolous objects that our conduct is\ninfluenced by this principle; it is often the secret motive of the most\nserious and important pursuits of both private and public life.\nThe poor man\u2019s son, whom Heaven in its anger has visited with ambition,\nwhen he begins to look around him admires the condition of the rich. He\nfinds the cottage of his father too small for his accommodation, and\nfancies he should be lodged more at his ease in a palace. He is\ndispleased with being obliged to walk a-foot, or to endure the fatigue\nof riding on horseback. He sees his superiors carried about in machines,\nand imagines that in one of these he could travel with less\ninconveniency. He feels himself naturally indolent, and willing to serve\nhimself with his own hands as little as possible; and judges, that a\nnumerous retinue of servants would save him from a great deal of\ntrouble. He thinks if he had attained all these, he would sit still\ncontentedly, and be quiet, enjoying himself in the thought of the\nhappiness and tranquillity of his situation. He is enchanted with the\ndistant idea of this felicity. It appears in his fancy like the life of\nsome superior rank of beings, and in order to arrive at it, he devotes\nhimself for ever to the pursuit of wealth and greatness. To obtain the\nconveniencies which these afford, he submits in the first year, nay in\nthe first month of his application, to more fatigue of body and more\nuneasiness of mind than he could have suffered through the whole of his\nlife from the want of them. He studies to distinguish himself in some\nlaborious profession. With the most unrelenting industry he labours\nnight and day to acquire talents superior to all his competitors. He\nendeavours next to bring those talents into public view, and with equal\nassiduity solicits every opportunity of employment. For this purpose he\nmakes his court to all mankind, he serves those whom he hates, and is\nobsequious to those whom he despises. Through the whole of his life he\npursues the idea of a certain artificial and elegant repose which he may\nnever arrive at, for which he sacrifices a real tranquillity that is at\nall times in his power, and which, if in the extremity of old age he\nshould at last attain to it, he will find to be in no respect preferable\nto that humble security and contentment which he had abandoned for it.\nIt is then, in the last dregs of life, his body wailed with toil and\ndiseases, his mind galled and ruffled by the memory of a thousand\ninjuries and disappointments which he imagines he has met with from the\ninjustice of his enemies, or from the perfidy and ingratitude of his\nfriends, that he begins at last to find that wealth and greatness are\nmere trinkets of frivolous utility, no more adapted for procuring ease\nof body or tranquillity of mind than the tweezer-cases of the lover of\ntoys; and like them too, more troublesome to the person who carries them\nabout with him than all the advantages they can afford him are\ncommodious. There is no other real difference between them, except that\nthe conveniencies of the one are somewhat more observable than those of\nthe other. The palaces, the gardens, the equipage, the retinue of the\ngreat are objects of which the obvious conveniency strikes every body.\nThey do not require that their masters should point out to us wherein\nconsists their utility. Of our own accord we readily enter into it, and\nby sympathy enjoy and thereby applaud the satisfaction which they are\nfitted to afford him. But the curiosity of a tooth-pick, of an\near-picker, of a machine for cutting the nails, or of any other trinket\nof the same kind, is not so obvious. Their convenience may perhaps be\nequally great, but it is not so striking, and we do not so readily enter\ninto the satisfaction of the man who possesses them. They are therefore\nless reasonable subjects of vanity than the magnificence of wealth and\ngreatness; and in this consists the sole advantage of these last. They\nmore effectually gratify that love of distinction so natural to man. To\none who was to live alone in a desolate island it might be a matter of\ndoubt, perhaps, whether a palace, or a collection of such small\nconveniencies as are commonly contained in a tweezer-case, would\ncontribute most to his happiness and enjoyment. If he is to live in\nsociety, indeed, there can be no comparison, because in this, as in all\nother cases, we constantly pay more regard to the sentiments of the\nspectator, than to those of the person principally concerned, and\nconsider rather how his situation will appear to other people, than how\nit will appear to himself. If we examine, however, why the spectator\ndistinguishes with such admiration the condition of the rich and the\ngreat, we shall find that it is not so much upon account of the superior\nease or pleasure which they are supposed to enjoy, as of the numberless\nartificial and elegant contrivances for promoting this ease or pleasure.\nHe does not even imagine that they are really happier than other people:\nbut he imagines that they possess more means of happiness. And it is the\ningenious and artful adjustment of those means to the end for which they\nwere intended, that is the principal source of his admiration. But in\nthe languor of disease, and the weariness of old age, the pleasures of\nthe vain and empty distinctions of greatness disappear. To one, in this\nsituation, they are no longer capable of recommending those toilsome\npursuits in which they had formerly engaged him. In his heart he curses\nambition, and vainly regrets the ease and the indolence of youth,\npleasures which are fled for ever, and which he has foolishly sacrificed\nfor what, when he has got it, can afford him no real satisfaction. In\nthis miserable aspect does greatness appear to every man when reduced\neither by spleen or disease to observe with attention his own situation,\nand to consider what it is that is really wanting to his happiness.\nPower and riches appear then to be what they are, enormous and operose\nmachines contrived to produce a few trifling conveniencies to the body,\nconsisting of springs the most nice and delicate, which must be kept in\norder with the most anxious attention, and which in spite of all our\ncare are ready every moment to burst into pieces, and to crush in their\nruins their unfortunate possessor. They are immense fabrics, which it\nrequires the labour of a life to raise, which threaten every moment to\noverwhelm the person that dwells in them, and which while they stand,\nthough they may save him from some smaller inconveniencies, can protect\nhim from none of the severer inclemencies of the season. They keep off\nthe summer shower, not the winter storm, but leave him always as much,\nand sometimes more exposed than before, to anxiety, to fear, and to\nsorrow; to diseases, to danger, and to death.\nBut though this splenetic philosophy, which in time of sickness or low\nspirits is familiar to every man, thus entirely depreciates those great\nobjects of human desire, when in better health and in better humour, we\nnever fail to regard them under a more agreeable aspect. Our\nimagination, which in pain and sorrow seems to be confined and cooped up\nwithin our own persons, in times of ease and prosperity expands itself\nto every thing around us. We are then charmed with the beauty of that\naccommodation which reigns in the palaces and \u0153conomy of the great; and\nadmire how every thing is adapted to promote their ease, to prevent\ntheir wants, to gratify their wishes, and to amuse and entertain their\nmost frivolous desires. If we consider the real satisfaction which all\nthese things are capable of affording, by itself and separated from the\nbeauty of that arrangement which is fitted to promote it, it will always\nappear in the highest degree contemptible and trifling. But we rarely\nview it in this abstract and philosophical light. We naturally confound\nit in our imagination with the order, the regular and harmonious\nmovement of the system, the machine or \u0153conomy by means of which it is\nproduced. The pleasures of wealth and greatness, when considered in this\ncomplex view, strike the imagination as something grand and beautiful\nand noble, of which the attainment is well worth all the toil and\nanxiety which we are so apt to bestow upon it.\nAnd it is well that nature imposes upon us in this manner. It is this\ndeception which rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of\nmankind. It is this which first prompted them to cultivate the ground,\nto build houses, to found cities and commonwealths, and to invent and\nimprove all the sciences and arts, which ennoble and embellish human\nlife; which have entirely changed the whole face of the globe, have\nturned the rude forests of nature into agreeable and fertile plains, and\nmade the trackless and barren ocean a new fund of subsistence, and the\ngreat high road of communication to the different nations of the earth.\nThe earth by these labours of mankind has been obliged to redouble her\nnatural fertility, and to maintain a greater multitude of inhabitants.\nIt is to no purpose, that the proud and unfeeling landlord views his\nextensive fields, and without a thought for the wants of his brethren,\nin imagination consumes himself the whole harvest that grows upon them.\nThe homely and vulgar proverb, that the eye is larger than the belly,\nnever was more fully verified than with regard to him. The capacity of\nhis stomach bears no proportion to the immensity of his desires, and\nwill receive no more than that of the meanest peasant. The rest he is\nobliged to distribute among those, who prepare, in the nicest manner,\nthat little which he himself makes use of, among those who sit up the\npalace in which this little is to be consumed, among those who provide\nand keep in order all the different baubles and trinkets, which are\nemployed in the \u0153conomy of greatness; all of whom thus derive from his\nluxury and caprice, that share of the necessaries of life, which they\nwould in vain have expected from his humanity or his justice. The\nproduce of the soil maintains at all times nearly that number of\ninhabitants, which it is capable of maintaining. The rich only select\nfrom the heap what is most precious and agreeable. They consume little\nmore than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness and\nrapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole\nend which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they\nemploy, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires,\nthey divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements. They\nare led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the\nnecessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been\ndivided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without\nintending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society,\nand afford means to the multiplication of the species. When Providence\ndivided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor\nabandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition. These\nlast too enjoy their share of all that it produces. In what constitutes\nthe real happiness of human life, they are in no respect inferior to\nthose who would seem so much above them. In ease of body and peace of\nmind, all the different ranks of life are nearly upon a level, and the\nbeggar, who suns himself by the side of the highway, possesses that\nsecurity which kings are fighting for.\nThe same principle, the same love of system, the same regard to the\nbeauty of order, of art and contrivance, frequently serves to recommend\nthose institutions, which tend to promote the public welfare. When a\npatriot exerts himself for the improvement of any part of the public\npolice, his conduct does not always arise from pure sympathy with the\nhappiness of those who are to reap the benefit of it. It is not commonly\nfrom a fellow-feeling with carriers and waggoners that a public-spirited\nman encourages the mending of high roads. When the legislature\nestablishes premiums and other encouragements to advance the linen or\nwoollen manufactures, its conduct seldom proceeds from pure sympathy\nwith the wearer of cheap or fine cloth, and much less from that with the\nmanufacturer, or merchant. The perfection of police, the extension of\ntrade and manufactures, are noble and magnificent objects. The\ncontemplation of them pleases us, and we are interested in whatever can\ntend to advance them. They make part of the great system of government,\nand the wheels of the political machine seem to move with more harmony\nand ease by means of them. We take pleasure in beholding the perfection\nof so beautiful and grand a system, and we are uneasy till we remove any\nobstruction that can in the least disturb or encumber the regularity of\nits motions. All constitutions of government, however, are valued only\nin proportion, as they tend to promote the happiness of those who live\nunder them. This is their sole use and end. From a certain spirit of\nsystem, however, from a certain love of art and contrivance, we\nsometimes seem to value the means more than the end, and to be eager to\npromote the happiness of our fellow-creatures, rather from a view to\nperfect and improve a certain beautiful and orderly system, than from\nany immediate sense or feeling of what they either suffer or enjoy.\nThere have been men of the greatest public spirit, who have shewn\nthemselves in other respects not very sensible to the feelings of\nhumanity. And on the contrary, there have been men of the greatest\nhumanity, who seem to have been entirely devoid of public spirit. Every\nman may find in the circle of his acquaintance instances both of the one\nkind and the other. Who had ever less humanity, or more public spirit,\nthan the celebrated legislator of Muscovy? The social and well natured\nJames the First of Great Britain seems, on the contrary, to have had\nscarce any passion, either for the glory, or the interest of his\ncountry. Would you awaken the industry of the man, who seems almost dead\nto ambition, it will often be to no purpose to describe to him the\nhappiness of the rich and the great; to tell him that they are generally\nsheltered from the sun and the rain, that they are seldom hungry, that\nthey are seldom cold, and that they are rarely exposed to weariness, or\nto want of any kind. The most eloquent exhortation of this kind will\nhave little effect upon him. If you would hope to succeed, you must\ndescribe to him the conveniency and arrangement of the different\napartments in their palaces, you must explain to him the propriety of\ntheir equipages, and point out to him the number, the order, and the\ndifferent offices of all their attendants. If any thing is capable of\nmaking impression upon him, this will. Yet all these things tend only to\nkeep off the sun and the rain, to save them from hunger and cold, from\nwant and weariness. In the same manner, if you would implant public\nvirtue in the breast of him, who seems heedless of the interest of his\ncountry, it will often be to no purpose to tell him, what superior\nadvantages the subjects of a well-governed state enjoy; that they are\nbetter lodged, that they are better clothed, that they are better fed.\nThese considerations will commonly make no great impression. You will be\nmore likely to persuade, if you describe the great system of public\npolice which procures these advantages, if you explain the connexions\nand dependencies of its several parts, their mutual subordination to one\nanother, and their general subserviency to the happiness of the society;\nif you show how this system might be introduced into his own country,\nwhat it is that hinders it from taking place there at present, how those\nobstructions might be removed, and all the several wheels of the machine\nof government be made to move with more harmony and smoothness, without\ngrating upon one another, or mutually retarding one another\u2019s motions.\nIt is scarce possible that a man should listen to a discourse of this\nkind, and not feel himself animated to some degree of public spirit. He\nwill, at least for the moment, feel some desire to remove those\nobstructions, and to put into motion so beautiful and so orderly a\nmachine. Nothing tends so much to promote public spirit as the study of\npolitics, of the several systems of civil government, their advantages\nand disadvantages, of the constitution of our own country, its\nsituation, and interest with regard to foreign nations, its commerce,\nits defence, the disadvantages it labours under, the dangers to which it\nmay be exposed, how to remove the one, and how to guard against the\nother. Upon this account political disquisitions, if just and\nreasonable, and practicable, are of all the works of speculation the\nmost useful. Even the weakest and the worst of them are not altogether\nwithout their utility. They serve at least to animate the public\npassions of men, and rouse them to seek out the means of promoting the\nhappiness of the society.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of the beauty which the appearance of utility bestows upon the\ncharacters and actions of men; and how far the perception of this beauty\nmay be regarded as one of the original principles of approbation._\nThe characters of men, as well as the contrivances of art, or the\ninstitutions of civil government, may be fitted either to promote or to\ndisturb the happiness both of the individual and of the society. The\nprudent, the equitable, the active, resolute, and sober character\npromises prosperity and satisfaction, both to the person himself and to\nevery one connected with him. The rash, the insolent, the slothful,\neffeminate, and voluptuous, on the contrary, forebodes ruin to the\nindividual, and misfortune to all who have any thing to do with him. The\nfirst turn of mind has at least all the beauty which can belong to the\nmost perfect machine that was ever invented for promoting the most\nagreeable purpose: and the second all the deformity of the most awkward\nand clumsy contrivance. What institution of government could tend so\nmuch to promote the happiness of mankind as the general prevalence of\nwisdom and virtue? All government is but an imperfect remedy for the\ndeficiency of these. Whatever beauty, therefore, can belong to civil\ngovernment upon account of its utility, must in a far superior degree\nbelong to these. On the contrary, what civil policy can be so ruinous\nand destructive as the vices of men? The fatal effects of bad government\narise from nothing, but that it does not sufficiently guard against the\nmischiefs which human wickedness gives occasion to.\nThis beauty and deformity which characters appear to derive from their\nusefulness or inconveniency, are apt to strike, in a peculiar manner,\nthose who consider, in an abstract and philosophical light, the actions\nand conduct of mankind. When a philosopher goes to examine why humanity\nis approved of, or cruelty condemned, he does not always form to\nhimself, in a very clear and distinct manner, the conception of any one\nparticular action either of cruelty or of humanity, but is commonly\ncontented with the vague and indeterminate idea which the general names\nof those qualities suggest to him. But it is in particular instances\nonly that the propriety or impropriety, the merit or demerit of actions\nis very obvious and discernible. It is only when particular examples are\ngiven that we perceive distinctly either the concord or disagreement\nbetween our own affections and those of the agent, or feel a social\ngratitude arise towards him in the one case, or a sympathetic resentment\nin the other. When we consider virtue and vice in an abstract and\ngeneral manner, the qualities by which they excite these several\nsentiments seem in a great measure to disappear, and the sentiments\nthemselves become less obvious and discernible. On the contrary, the\nhappy effects of the one and the fatal consequences of the other seem\nthen to rise up to the view, and as it were to stand out and distinguish\nthemselves from all the other qualities of either.\nThe same ingenious and agreeable author who first explained why utility\npleases, has been so struck with this view of things, as to resolve our\nwhole approbation of virtue into a perception of this species of beauty\nwhich results from the appearance of utility. No qualities of the mind,\nhe observes, are approved of as virtuous, but such as are useful or\nagreeable either to the person himself or to others; and no qualities\nare disapproved of as vicious but such as have a contrary tendency. And\nNature, indeed, seems to have so happily adjusted our sentiments of\napprobation and disapprobation, to the conveniency both of the\nindividual and of the society, that after the strictest examination it\nwill be found, I believe, that this is universally the case. But still I\naffirm, that it is not the view of this utility or hurtfulness which is\neither the first or principal source of our approbation and\ndisapprobation. These sentiments are no doubt enhanced and enlivened by\nthe perception of the beauty or deformity which results from this\nutility or hurtfulness. But still, I say, they are originally and\nessentially different from this perception.\nFor first of all, it seems impossible that the approbation of virtue\nshould be a sentiment of the same kind with that by which we approve of\na convenient and well contrived building, or that we should have no\nother reason for praising a man than that for which we commend a chest\nof drawers.\nAnd secondly, it will be found, upon examination, that the usefulness of\nany disposition of mind is seldom the first ground of our approbation;\nand that the sentiment of approbation always involves in it a sense of\npropriety quite distinct from the perception of utility. We may observe\nthis with regard to all the qualities which are approved of as virtuous,\nboth those which, according to this system, are originally valued as\nuseful to ourselves, as well as those which are esteemed on account of\ntheir usefulness to others.\nThe qualities most useful to ourselves are, first of all, superior\nreason and understanding, by which we are capable of discerning the\nremote consequences of all our actions, and of foreseeing the advantage\nor detriment which is likely to result from them: and secondly,\nself-command, by which we are enabled to abstain from present pleasure\nor to endure present pain, in order to obtain a greater pleasure or to\navoid a greater pain in some future time. In the union of those two\nqualities consists the virtue of prudence, of all the virtues that which\nis most useful to the individual.\nWith regard to the first of those qualities, it has been observed on a\nformer occasion, that superior reason and understanding are originally\napproved of as just and right and accurate, and not merely as useful or\nadvantageous. It is in the abstruser sciences, particularly in the\nhigher parts of mathematics, that the greatest and most admired\nexertions of human reason have been displayed. But the utility of those\nsciences, either to the individual or to the public, is not very\nobvious, and to prove it requires a discussion which is not always very\neasily comprehended. It was not, therefore, their utility which first\nrecommended them to the public admiration. This quality was but little\ninsisted upon, till it became necessary to make some reply to the\nreproaches of those, who, having themselves no taste for such sublime\ndiscoveries, endeavoured to depreciate them as useless.\nThat self-command, in the same manner, by which we restrain our present\nappetites, in order to gratify them more fully upon another occasion, is\napproved of, as much under the aspect of propriety, as under that of\nutility. When we act in this manner, the sentiments which influence our\nconduct seem exactly to coincide with those of the spectator. The\nspectator does not feel the felicitations of our present appetites. To\nhim the pleasure which we are to enjoy a week hence, or a year hence, is\njust as interesting as that which we are to enjoy this moment. When for\nthe sake of the present, therefore, we sacrifice the future, our conduct\nappears to him absurd and extravagant in the highest degree, and he\ncannot enter into the principles which influence it. On the contrary,\nwhen we abstain from present pleasure, in order to secure greater\npleasure to come, when we act as if the remote object interests us as\nmuch as that which immediately presses upon the senses, as our\naffections exactly correspond with his own, he cannot fail to approve of\nour behaviour: and as he knows from experience, how few are capable of\nthis self-command, he looks upon our conduct with a considerable degree\nof wonder and admiration. Hence arises that eminent esteem with which\nall men naturally regard a steady perseverance in the practice of\nfrugality, industry, and application, though directed to no other\npurpose than the acquisition of fortune. The resolute firmness of the\nperson who acts in this manner, and in order to obtain a great though\nremote advantage, not only gives up all present pleasures, but endures\nthe greatest labour both of mind and body, necessarily commands our\napprobation. That view of his interest and happiness which appears to\nregulate his conduct, exactly tallies with the idea which we naturally\nform of it. There is the most perfect correspondence between his\nsentiments and our own, and at the same time, from our experience of the\ncommon weakness of human nature, it is a correspondence which we could\nnot reasonably have expected. We not only approve, therefore, but in\nsome measure admire his conduct, and think it worthy of a considerable\ndegree of applause. It is the consciousness of this merited approbation\nand esteem which is alone capable of supporting the agent in this tenour\nof conduct. The pleasure which we are to enjoy ten years hence interests\nus so little in comparison with that which we may enjoy to-day, the\npassion which the first excites, is naturally so weak in comparison with\nthat violent emotion which the second is apt to give occasion to, that\none could never be any balance to the other, unless it was supported by\nthe sense of propriety, by the consciousness that we merited the esteem\nand approbation of every body, by acting in the one way, and that we\nbecame the proper objects of their contempt and derision by behaving in\nthe other.\nHumanity, justice, generosity, and public spirit, are the qualities most\nuseful to others. Wherein consists the propriety of humanity and justice\nhas been explained upon a former occasion, where it was shewn how much\nour esteem and approbation of those qualities depended upon the concord\nbetween the affections of the agent and those of the spectators.\nThe propriety of generosity and public spirit is founded upon the same\nprinciple with that of justice. Generosity is different from humanity.\nThose two qualities, which at first sight seem so nearly allied, do not\nalways belong to the same person. Humanity is the virtue of a woman,\ngenerosity of a man. The fair sex, who have commonly much more\ntenderness than ours, have seldom so much generosity. That women rarely\nmake considerable donations is an observation of the civil law[7].\nHumanity consists merely in the exquisite fellow-feeling which the\nspectator entertains with the sentiments of the persons principally\nconcerned, so as to grieve for their sufferings, to resent their\ninjuries, and to rejoice at their good fortune. The most humane actions\nrequire no self-denial, no self-command, no great exertion of the sense\nof propriety. They consist only in doing what this exquisite sympathy\nwould of its own accord prompt us to do. But it is otherwise with\ngenerosity. We never are generous except when in some respect we prefer\nsome other person to ourselves, and sacrifice some great and important\ninterest of our own to an equal interest of a friend or of a superior.\nThe man who gives up his pretensions to an office that was the great\nobject of his ambition, because he imagines that the services of another\nare better entitled to it, the man who exposes his life to defend that\nof his friend, which he judges to be of more importance, neither of them\nact from humanity, or because they feel more exquisitely what concerns\nthat other person than what concerns themselves. They both consider\nthose opposite interests not in the light in which they naturally appear\nto themselves, but in that in which they appear to others. To every\nby-stander, the success or preservation of this other person may justly\nbe more interesting than their own; but it cannot be so to themselves.\nWhen to the interest of this other person, therefore, they sacrifice\ntheir own, they accommodate themselves to the sentiments of the\nspectator, and by an effort of magnanimity act according to those views\nof things which they feel, must naturally occur to any third person. The\nsoldier who throws away his life in order to defend that of his officer,\nwould perhaps be but little affected by the death of that officer, if it\nshould happen without any fault of his own; and a very small disaster\nwhich had befallen himself might excite a much more lively sorrow. But\nwhen he endeavours to act so as to deserve applause, and to make the\nimpartial spectator enter into the principles of his conduct, he feels,\nthat to every body but himself, his own life is a trifle compared with\nthat of his officer, and that when he sacrifices the one to the other,\nhe acts quite properly and agreeably to what would be the natural\napprehensions of every impartial by-stander.\nFootnote 7:\nRaro mulieres donare solent.\nIt is the same case with the greater exertions of public spirit. When a\nyoung officer exposes his life to acquire some inconsiderable addition\nto the dominions of his sovereign, it is not, because the acquisition of\nthe new territory is, to himself, an object more desireable than the\npreservation of his own life. To him his own life is of infinitely more\nvalue than the conquest of a whole kingdom for the state which he\nserves. But when he compares those two objects with one another, he does\nnot view them in the light in which they naturally appear to himself,\nbut in that in which they appear to the nation he fights for. To them\nthe success of the war is of the highest importance; the life of a\nprivate person of scarce any consequence. When he puts himself in their\nsituation, he immediately feels that he cannot be too prodigal of his\nblood, if by shedding it, he can promote so valuable a purpose. In thus\nthwarting, from a sense of duty and propriety, the strongest of all\nnatural propensities, consists the heroism of his conduct. There is many\nan honest Englishman, who, in his private station, would be more\nseriously disturbed by the loss of a guinea, than by the national loss\nof Minorca, who yet, had it been in his power to defend that fortress,\nwould have sacrificed his life a thousand times rather than, through his\nfault, have let it fall into the hands of the enemy. When the first\nBrutus led forth his own sons to a capital punishment, because they had\nconspired against the rising liberty of Rome, he sacrificed what, if he\nhad consulted his own breast only, would appear to be the stronger to\nthe weaker affection. Brutus ought naturally to have felt much more for\nthe death of his own sons, than for all that probably Rome could have\nsuffered from the want of so great an example. But he viewed them, not\nwith the eyes of a father, but with those of a Roman citizen. He entered\nso thoroughly into the sentiments of this last character, that he paid\nno regard to that tye, by which he himself was connected with them; and\nto a Roman citizen, the sons even of Brutus seemed contemptible, when\nput into the balance with the smallest interest of Rome. In these and in\nall other cases of this kind, our admiration is not so much founded upon\nthe utility, as upon the unexpected, and on that account the great, the\nnoble, and exalted propriety of such actions. This utility, when we come\nto view it, bestows upon them, undoubtedly, a new beauty, and upon that\naccount still further recommends them, to our approbation. This beauty,\nhowever, is chiefly perceived by men of reflection and speculation, and\nis by no means the quality which first recommends such actions to the\nnatural sentiments of the bulk of mankind.\nIt is to be observed, that so far as the sentiment of approbation arises\nfrom the perception of this beauty of utility, it has no reference of\nany kind to the sentiments of others. If it was possible, therefore,\nthat a person should grow up to manhood without any communication with\nsociety, his own actions might, notwithstanding, be agreeable or\ndisagreeable to him on account of their tendency to his happiness or\ndisadvantage. He might perceive a beauty of this kind in prudence,\ntemperance, and good conduct, and a deformity in the opposite behaviour:\nHe might view his own temper and character with that sort of\nsatisfaction with which we consider a well contrived machine, in the one\ncase; or with that sort of distaste and dissatisfaction with which we\nregard a very awkward and clumsy contrivance, in the other. As these\nperceptions, however, are merely a matter of taste, and have all the\nfeebleness and delicacy of that species of perceptions, upon the\njustness of which what is properly called taste is founded, they\nprobably would not be much attended to by one in his solitary and\nmiserable condition. Even though they should occur to him, they would by\nno means have the same effect upon him, antecedent to his connexion with\nsociety, which they would have in consequence of that connexion. He\nwould not be cast down with inward shame at the thought of this\ndeformity; nor would he be elevated with secret triumph of mind from the\nconsciousness of the contrary beauty. He would not exult from the notion\nof deserving reward in the one case, nor tremble from the suspicion of\nmeriting punishment in the other. All such sentiments suppose the idea\nof some other being, who is the natural judge of the person that feels\nthem; and it is only by sympathy with the decisions of this arbiter of\nhis conduct, that he can conceive, either the triumph of self-applause,\nor the shame of self-condemnation.\nPART V.\nOf the INFLUENCE of CUSTOM and FASHION upon the sentiments of moral\napprobation and disapprobation.\nCONSISTING OF ONE SECTION.\nCHAP. I.\n_Of the influence of custom and fashion upon our notions of beauty and\ndeformity._\nThere are other principles besides those already enumerated, which have\na considerable influence upon the moral sentiments of mankind, and are\nthe chief causes of the many irregular and discordant opinions which\nprevail in different ages and nations concerning what is blameable or\npraise-worthy. These principles are custom and faction, principles which\nextend their dominion over our judgments concerning beauty of every\nkind.\nWhen two objects have frequently been seen together, the imagination\nacquires a habit of passing easily from the one to the other. If the\nfirst appear, we lay our account that the second is to follow. Of their\nown accord they put us in mind of one another, and the attention glides\neasily along them. Though, independent of custom, there should be no\nreal beauty in their union, yet when custom has thus connected them\ntogether, we feel an impropriety in their reparation. The one we think\nis awkward when it appears without its usual companion. We miss\nsomething which we expected to find, and the habitual arrangement of our\nideas is disturbed by the disappointment. A suit of clothes, for\nexample, seems to want something if they are without the most\ninsignificant ornament which usually accompanies them, and we find a\nmeanness or awkwardness in the absence even of a haunch button. When\nthere is any natural propriety in the union, custom increases our sense\nof it, and makes a different arrangement appear still more disagreeable\nthan it would otherwise seem to be. Those who have been accustomed to\nsee things in a good taste, are more disgusted by whatever is clumsy or\nawkward. Where the conjunction is improper, custom either diminishes, or\ntakes away altogether, our sense of the impropriety. Those who have been\naccustomed to slovenly disorder lose all sense of neatness or elegance.\nThe modes of furniture or dress which seem ridiculous to strangers, give\nno offence to the people who are used to them.\nFashion is different from custom, or rather is a particular species of\nit. That is not the fashion which every body wears, but which those wear\nwho are of a high rank, or character. The graceful, the easy, and\ncommanding manners of the great, joined to the usual richness and\nmagnificence of their dress, give a grace to the very form which they\nhappen to bestow upon it. As long as they continue to use this form, it\nis connected in our imaginations with the idea of something that is\ngenteel and magnificent, and though in itself it should be indifferent,\nit seems, on account of this relation, to have something about it that\nis genteel and magnificent too. As soon as they drop it, it loses all\nthe grace, which it had appeared to possess before, and being now used\nonly by the inferior ranks of people, seems to have something of their\nmeanness and awkwardness.\nDress and furniture are allowed by all the world to be entirely under\nthe dominion of custom and fashion. The influence of those principles,\nhowever, is by no means confined to so narrow a sphere, but extends\nitself to whatever is in any respect the object of taste, to music, to\npoetry, to architecture. The modes of dress and furniture are\ncontinually changing, and that fashion appearing ridiculous to-day which\nwas admired five years ago, we are experimentally convinced that it owed\nits vogue chiefly or entirely to custom and fashion. Clothes and\nfurniture are not made of very durable materials. A well fancied coat is\ndone in a twelve-month, and cannot continue longer to propagate, as the\nfashion, that form according to which it was made. The modes of\nfurniture change less rapidly than those of dress; because furniture is\ncommonly more durable. In five or six years, however, it generally\nundergoes an entire revolution, and every man in his own time sees the\nfashion in this respect change many different ways. The productions of\nthe other arts are much more lasting, and, when happily imagined, may\ncontinue to propagate the fashion of their make for a much longer time.\nA well contrived building may endure many centuries: a beautiful air may\nbe delivered down by a sort of tradition, through many successive\ngenerations: a well written poem may last as long as the world; and all\nof them continue for ages together, to give the vogue to that particular\nstyle, to that particular taste or manner, according to which each of\nthem was composed. Few men have an opportunity of seeing in their own\ntimes the fashion in any of these arts change very considerably. Few men\nhave so much experience and acquaintance with the different modes which\nhave obtained in remote ages and nations, as to be thoroughly reconciled\nto them, or to judge with impartiality between them, and what takes\nplace in their own age and country. Few men therefore are willing to\nallow that custom or fashion have much influence upon their judgments\nconcerning what is beautiful, or otherwise, in the productions of any of\nthose arts; but imagine, that all the rules, which they think ought to\nbe observed in each of them, are founded upon reason and nature, not\nupon habit or prejudice. A very little attention, however, may convince\nthem of the contrary, and satisfy them, that the influence of custom and\nfashion over dress and furniture, is not more absolute than over\narchitecture, poetry, and music.\nCan any reason, for example, be assigned why the Doric capital should be\nappropriated to a pillar, whose height is equal to eight diameters; the\nIonic volute to one of nine; and the Corinthian foliage to one of ten?\nThe propriety of each of those appropriations can be founded upon\nnothing but habit and custom. The eye having been used to see a\nparticular proportion connected with a particular ornament, would be\noffended if they were not joined together. Each of the five orders has\nits peculiar ornaments, which cannot be changed for any other, without\ngiving offence to all those who know any thing of the rules of\narchitecture. According to some architects, indeed, such is the\nexquisite judgment with which the ancients have assigned to each order\nits proper ornaments, that no others can be found which are equally\nsuitable. It seems, however, a little difficult to be conceived that\nthese forms, though, no doubt, extremely agreeable, should be the only\nforms which can suit those proportions, or that there should not be five\nhundred others which, antecedent to established custom, would have\nfitted them equally well. When custom, however, has established\nparticular rules of building, provided they are not absolutely\nunreasonable, it is absurd to think of altering them for others which\nare only equally good, or even for others which, in point of elegance\nand beauty, have naturally some little advantage over them. A man would\nbe ridiculous who should appear in public with a suit of clothes quite\ndifferent from those which are commonly worn, though the new dress\nshould in itself be ever so graceful or convenient. And there seems to\nbe an absurdity of the same kind in ornamenting a house after a quite\ndifferent manner from that which custom and fashion have prescribed;\nthough the new ornaments should in themselves be somewhat superior to\nthe common ones.\nAccording to the ancient rhetoricians, a certain measure or verse was by\nnature appropriated to each particular species of writing, as being\nnaturally expressive of that character, sentiment, or passion, which\nought to predominate in it. One verse, they said, was fit for grave and\nanother for gay works, which could not, they thought, be interchanged\nwithout the greatest impropriety. The experience of modern times,\nhowever, seems to contradict this principle, though in itself it would\nappear to be extremely probable. What is the burlesque verse in English\nis the heroic verse in French. The tragedies of Racine and the Henriad\nof Voltaire, are in the same verse with,\n_Thus said to my lady the knight full of care._\nThe burlesque verse in French, on the contrary, is pretty much the same\nwith the heroic verse of ten syllables in English. Custom has made the\none nation associate the ideas of gravity, sublimity, and seriousness,\nto that measure which the other has connected with whatever is gay,\nflippant, and ludicrous. Nothing would appear more absurd in English\nthan a tragedy written in the Alexandrine verses of the French, or in\nFrench, than a work of the same kind in verses of ten syllables.\nAn eminent artist will bring about a considerable change in the\nestablished modes of each of those arts, and introduce a new fashion of\nwriting, music, or architecture. As the dress of an agreeable man of\nhigh rank recommends itself, and how peculiar and fantastical soever,\ncomes soon to be admired and imitated; so the excellencies of an eminent\nmatter recommend his peculiarities, and his manner becomes the\nfashionable style in the art which he practises. The taste of the\nItalians in music and architecture, has, within these fifty years,\nundergone a considerable change, from imitating the peculiarities of\nsome eminent masters in each of those arts. Seneca is accused by\nQuintilian of having corrupted the taste of the Romans, and of having\nintroduced a frivolous prettiness in the room of majestic reason and\nmasculine eloquence. Sallust and Tacitus have by others been charged\nwith the same accusation, tho\u2019 in a different manner. They gave\nreputation, it is pretended, to a style, which though in the highest\ndegree concise, elegant, expressive, and even poetical, wanted, however,\nease, simplicity, and nature, and was evidently the production of the\nmost laboured and studied affectation. How many great qualities must\nthat writer possess who can thus render his very faults agreeable? After\nthe praise of refining the taste of a nation, the highest eulogy,\nperhaps, which can be bestowed upon any author is to say, that he\ncorrupted it. In our own language, Mr. Pope and Dr. Swift have each of\nthem introduced a manner different from what was practised before, into\nall works that are written in rhyme, the one in long verses, the other\nin short. The quaintness of Butler has given place to the plainness of\nSwift. The rambling freedom of Dryden, and the correct but often tedious\nand prosaic languor of Addison, are no longer the objects of imitation,\nbut all long verses are now written after the manner of the nervous\nprecision of Mr. Pope.\nNeither is it only over the productions of the arts, that custom and\nfashion exert their dominion. They influence our judgments, in the same\nmanner, with regard to the beauty of natural objects. What various and\nopposite forms are deemed beautiful in different species of things? The\nproportions which are admired in one animal, are altogether different\nfrom those which are esteemed in another. Every class of things has its\nown peculiar conformation, which is approved of, and has a beauty of its\nown, distinct from that of every other species. It is upon this account\nthat a learned Jesuit, father Buffier, has determined that the beauty of\nevery object consists in that form and colour, which is most usual among\nthings of that particular sort to which it belongs. Thus, in the human\nform, the beauty of each feature lies in a certain middle equally\nremoved from a variety of other forms that are ugly. A beautiful nose,\nfor example, is one that is neither very long, nor very short, neither\nvery straight, nor very crooked, but a sort of middle among all these\nextremes, and less different from any one of them, than all of them are\nfrom one another. It is the form which Nature seems to have aimed at in\nthem all, which, however, she deviates from in a great variety of ways,\nand very seldom hits exactly; but to which all those deviations still\nbear a very strong resemblance. When a number of drawings are made after\none pattern, though they may all miss it in some respects, yet they will\nall resemble it more than they resemble one another; the general\ncharacter of the pattern will run through them all; the most singular\nand odd will be those which are most wide of it; and though very few\nwill copy it exactly, yet the most accurate delineations will bear a\ngreater resemblance to the most careless, than the careless ones will\nbear to one another. In the same manner, in each species of creatures,\nwhat is most beautiful bears the strongest characters of the general\nfabric of the species, and has the strongest resemblance to the greater\npart of the individuals with which it is classed. Monsters, on the\ncontrary, or what is perfectly deformed, are always most singular and\nodd, and have the least resemblance to the generality of that species to\nwhich they belong. And thus the beauty of each species, though in one\nsense the rarest of all things, because few individuals hit this middle\nform exactly, yet in another, is the most common, because all the\ndeviations from it resemble it more than they resemble one another. The\nmost customary form, therefore, is in each species of things, according\nto him, the most beautiful. And hence it is that a certain practice and\nexperience in contemplating each species of objects is requisite, before\nwe can judge of its beauty, or know wherein the middle and most usual\nform consists. The nicest judgment concerning the beauty of the human\nspecies, will not help us to judge of that of flowers, or horses, or any\nother species of things. It is for the same reason that in different\nclimates and where different customs and ways of living take place, as\nthe generality of any species receives a different conformation from\nthose circumstances, so different ideas of its beauty prevail. The\nbeauty of a Moorish is not exactly the same with that of an English\nhorse. What different ideas are formed in different nations concerning\nthe beauty of the human shape and countenance? A fair complexion is a\nshocking deformity upon the coast of Guinea. Thick lips and a flat nose\nare a beauty. In some nations long ears that hang down upon the\nshoulders are the objects of universal admiration. In China if a lady\u2019s\nfoot is so large as to be fit to walk upon, she is regarded as a monster\nof ugliness. Some of the savage nations in North America tie four boards\nround the heads of their children, and thus squeeze them, while the\nbones are tender and gristly, into a form that is almost perfectly\nsquare. Europeans are astonished at the absurd barbarity of this\npractice, to which some missionaries have imputed the singular stupidity\nof those nations among whom it prevails. But, when they condemn those\nsavages, they do not reflect that the ladies in Europe had, till within\nthese very few years, been endeavouring, for near a century past, to\nsqueeze the beautiful roundness of their natural shape into a square\nform of the same kind. And that notwithstanding the many distortions and\ndiseases which this practice was known to occasion, custom had rendered\nit agreeable among some of the most civilized nations, which, perhaps,\nthe world ever beheld.\nSuch is the system of this learned and ingenious father, concerning the\nnature of beauty; of which the whole charm, according to him, would thus\nseem to arise from its falling in with the habits which custom had\nimpressed upon the imagination, with regard to things of each particular\nkind. I cannot, however, be induced to believe that our sense even of\nexternal beauty is founded altogether on custom. The utility of any\nform, its fitness for the useful purposes for which it was intended,\nevidently recommends it, and renders it agreeable to us independent of\ncustom. Certain colours are more agreeable than others, and give more\ndelight to the eye the first time it ever beholds them. A smooth surface\nis more agreeable than a rough one. Variety is more pleasing than a\ntedious undiversified uniformity. Connected variety, in which each new\nappearance seems to be introduced by what went before it, and in which\nall the adjoining parts seem to have some natural relation to one\nanother, is more agreeable than a disjointed and disorderly assemblage\nof unconnected objects. But though I cannot admit that custom is the\nsole principle of beauty, yet I can so far allow the truth of this\ningenious system as to grant, that there is scarce any one external form\nso beautiful as to please, if quite contrary to custom and unlike\nwhatever we have been used to in that particular species of things: or\nso deformed as not to be agreeable, if custom uniformly supports it, and\nhabituates us to see it in every single individual of the kind.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of the influence of custom and fashion upon moral sentiments._\nSince our sentiments concerning beauty of every kind are so much\ninfluenced by custom and fashion, it cannot be expected, that those,\nconcerning the beauty, of conduct, should be entirely exempted from the\ndominion of those principles. Their influence here, however, seems to be\nmuch less than it is every where else. There is, perhaps, no form of\nexternal objects, how absurd and fantastical soever, to which custom\nwill not reconcile us, or which fashion will not render even agreeable.\nBut the characters and conduct of a Nero, or a Claudius, are what no\ncustom will ever reconcile us to, what no fashion will ever render\nagreeable; but the one will always be the object of dread and hatred;\nthe other of scorn and derision. The principles of the imagination, upon\nwhich our sense of beauty depends, are of a very nice and delicate\nnature, and may easily be altered by habit and education: but the\nsentiments of moral approbation and disapprobation, are founded on the\nstrongest and most vigorous passions of human nature; and though they\nmay be somewhat warpt, cannot be entirely perverted.\nBut though the influence of custom and fashion, upon moral sentiments,\nis not altogether so great, it is however perfectly similar to what it\nis every where else. When custom and fashion coincide with the natural\nprinciples of right and wrong, they heighten the delicacy of our\nsentiments, and increase our abhorrence for every thing which approaches\nto evil. Those who have been educated in what is really good company,\nnot in what is commonly called such, who have been accustomed to see\nnothing in the persons whom they esteemed and lived with, but justice,\nmodesty, humanity, and good order, are more shocked with whatever seems\nto be inconsistent with the rules which those virtues prescribe. Those,\non the contrary, who have had the misfortune to be brought up amidst\nviolence, licentiousness, falsehood, and injustice, lose, though not all\nsense of the impropriety of such conduct, yet all sense of its dreadful\nenormity, or of the vengeance and punishment due to it. They have been\nfamiliarized with it from their infancy, custom has rendered it habitual\nto them, and they are very apt to regard it as, what is called the way\nof the world, something which either may, or must be practised, to\nhinder us from being the dupes of our own integrity.\nFashion too will sometimes give reputation to a certain degree of\ndisorder, and on the contrary discountenance qualities which deserve\nesteem. In the reign of Charles II. a degree of licentiousness was\ndeemed the characteristic of a liberal education. It was connected,\naccording to the notions of those times, with generosity, sincerity,\nmagnanimity, loyalty, and proved that the person who acted in this\nmanner, was a gentleman, and not a puritan; severity of manners, and\nregularity of conduct, on the other hand, were altogether unfashionable,\nand were connected, in the imagination of that age, with cant, cunning,\nhypocrisy, and low manners. To superficial minds, the vices of the great\nseem at all times agreeable. They connect them, not only with the\nsplendour of fortune, but with many superiour virtues, which they\nascribe to their superiors; with the spirit of freedom and independency,\nwith frankness, generosity, humanity, and politeness. The virtues of the\ninferior ranks of people, on the contrary, their parsimonious frugality,\ntheir painful industry, and rigid adherence to rules, seem to them mean\nand disagreeable. They connect them, both with the meanness of the\nstation to which those qualities commonly belong, and with many great\nvices, which, they suppose, usually accompany them; such as an abject,\ncowardly, ill-natured, lying, pilfering disposition.\nThe objects with which men in the different professions and states of\nlife are conversant, being very different, and habituating them to very\ndifferent passions, naturally form in them very different characters and\nmanners. We expect in each rank and procession, a degree of those\nmanners, which, experience has taught us, belong to it. But as in each\nspecies of things, we are particularly pleased with the middle\nconformation, which in every part and feature agrees most exactly with\nthe general standard which nature seems to have established for things\nof that kind; so in each rank, or, if I may say so, in each species of\nmen, we are particularly pleased, if they have neither too much, nor too\nlittle of the character which usually accompanies their particular\ncondition and situation. A man, we say, should look like his trade and\nprofession; yet the pedantry of every profession is disagreeable. The\ndifferent periods of life have, for the same reason, different manners\nassigned to them. We expect in old age, that gravity and sedateness\nwhich its infirmities, its long experience, and its worn-out sensibility\nseem to render both natural and respectable; and we lay our account to\nfind in youth that sensibility, that gaiety and sprightly vivacity which\nexperience teaches us to expect from the lively impressions that all\ninteresting objects are apt to make upon the tender and unpractised\nsenses of that early period of life. Each of those two ages, however,\nmay easily have too much of these peculiarities which belong to it. The\nflirting levity of youth, and the immoveable insensibility of old age,\nare equally disagreeable. The young, according to the common saying, are\nmost agreeable when in their behaviour there is something of the manners\nof the old, and the old, when they retain something of the gaiety of the\nyoung. Either of them, however, may easily have too much of the manners\nof the other. The extreme coldness, and dull formality, which are\npardoned in old age, make youth ridiculous. The levity, the\ncarelessness, and the vanity, which are indulged in youth, render old\nage contemptible.\nThe peculiar character and manners which we are led by custom to\nappropriate to each rank and profession, have sometimes perhaps a\npropriety independent of custom; and are what we should approve of for\ntheir own sakes, if we took into consideration all the different\ncircumstances which naturally affect those in each different state of\nlife. The propriety of a person\u2019s behaviour, depends not upon its\nsuitableness to any one circumstance of his situation, but to all the\ncircumstances, which, when we bring his case home to ourselves we feel,\nshould naturally call upon his attention. If he appears to be so much\noccupied by any one of them, as entirely to neglect the rest, we\ndisapprove of his conduct, as something which we cannot entirely go\nalong with, because not properly adjusted to all the circumstances of\nhis situation: yet, perhaps, the emotion he expresses for the object\nwhich principally interests him, does not exceed what we should entirely\nsympathize with, and approve of, in one whose attention was not required\nby any other thing. A parent in private life might, upon the loss of an\nonly son, express without blame, a degree of grief and tenderness, which\nwould be unpardonable in a general at the head of an army, when glory,\nand the public safety demanded so great a part of his attention. As\ndifferent objects ought, upon common occasions, to occupy the attention\nof men of different professions, so different passions ought, naturally\nto become habitual to them; and when we bring home to ourselves their\nsituation in this particular respect, we must be sensible, that every\noccurrence should naturally affect them more or less, according as the\nemotion which it excites, coincides or disagrees with the fixt habit and\ntemper of their minds. We cannot expect the same sensibility to the gay\npleasures and amusements of life in a clergyman which we lay our account\nwith in an officer. The man whose peculiar occupation it is to keep the\nworld in mind of that awful futurity which awaits them, who is to\nannounce what may be the fatal consequences of every deviation from the\nrules of duty, and who is himself to set the example of the most exact\nconformity, seems to be the messenger of tidings, which cannot, in\npropriety, be delivered either with levity or indifference. His mind is\nsupposed to be continually occupied with what is too grand and solemn,\nto leave any room for the impressions of those frivolous objects, which\nfill up the attention of the dissipated and the gay. We readily feel\ntherefore, that, independent of custom, there is a propriety in the\nmanners which custom has allotted to this profession; and that nothing\ncan be more suitable to the character of a clergyman, than that grave,\nthat austere and abstracted severity, which we are habituated to expect\nin his behaviour. These reflections are so very obvious, that there is\nscarce any man so inconsiderate, as not, at some time, to have made\nthem, and to have accounted to himself in this manner for his\napprobation of the usual character of this order.\nThe foundation of the customary character of some other professions is\nnot so obvious, and our approbation of it is founded entirely in habit,\nwithout being either confirmed, or enlivened by any reflections of this\nkind. We are led by custom, for example, to annex the character of\ngaiety, levity, and sprightly freedom, as well as of some degree of\ndissipation, to the military profession: yet, if we were to consider\nwhat mood or tone of temper would be most suitable to this situation, we\nshould be apt to determine, perhaps, that the most serious and\nthoughtful turn of mind, would best become those whose lives are\ncontinually exposed to uncommon danger; and who should therefore be more\nconstantly occupied with the thoughts of death and its consequences than\nother men. It is this very circumstance, however, which is not\nimprobably the occasion why the contrary turn of mind prevails so much\namong men of this profession. It requires so great an effort to conquer\nthe fear of death, when we survey it with steadiness and attention, that\nthose who are constantly exposed to it, find it easier to turn away\ntheir thoughts from it altogether, to wrap themselves up in careless\nsecurity and indifference, and to plunge themselves, for this purpose,\ninto every sort of amusement and dissipation. A camp is not the element\nof a thoughtful or a melancholy man: persons of that cast, indeed, are\noften abundantly determined, and are capable, by a great effort, of\ngoing on with inflexible resolution to the most unavoidable death. But\nto be exposed to continual, though less imminent danger, to be obliged\nto exert, for a long time, a degree of this effort, exhausts and\ndepresses the mind, and renders it incapable of all happiness and\nenjoyment. The gay and careless, who have occasion to make no effort at\nall, who fairly resolve never to look before them, but to lose in\ncontinual pleasures and amusements, all anxiety about their situation,\nmore easily support such circumstances. Whenever, by any peculiar\ncircumstances, an officer has no reason to lay his account with being\nexposed to any uncommon danger, he is very apt to lose the gaiety and\ndissipated thoughtlessness of his character. The captain of a city guard\nis commonly as sober, careful, and penurious an animal as the rest of\nhis fellow-citizens. A long peace is, for the same reason, very apt to\ndiminish the difference between the civil and the military character.\nThe ordinary situation, however, of men of this profession, renders\ngaiety, and a degree of dissipation, so much their usual character; and\ncustom has, in our imagination, so strongly connected this character\nwith this state of life, that we are very apt to despise any man, whose\npeculiar humour or situation, renders him incapable of acquiring it. We\nlaugh at the grave and careful faces of a city guard, which, so little\nresemble those of their profession. They themselves seem often to be\nashamed of the regularity of their own manners, and, not to be out of\nthe fashion of their trade, are fond of affecting that levity, which is\nby no means natural to them. Whatever is the deportment which we have\nbeen accustomed to see in a respectable order of men, it comes to be so\nassociated in our imagination with that order, that whenever we see the\none, we lay our account that we are to meet with the other, and when\ndisappointed, miss something which we expected to find. We are\nembarrassed, and put to a stand, and know not how to address ourselves\nto a character, which plainly affects to be of a different species from\nthose with which we should have been disposed to class it.\nThe different situations of different ages and countries, are apt, in\nthe same manner, to give different characters to the generality of those\nwho live in them, and their sentiments concerning the particular degree\nof each quality, that is either blameable, or praise-worthy, vary\naccording to that degree, which is usual in their own country, and in\ntheir own times. That degree of politeness, which would be highly\nesteemed, perhaps, would be thought effeminate adulation, in Russia,\nwould be regarded as rudeness and barbarism at the court of France. That\ndegree of order and frugality, which, in a Polish nobleman, would be\nconsidered as excessive parsimony, would be regarded as extravagance in\na citizen of Amsterdam. Every age and country look upon that degree of\neach quality, which is commonly to be met with in those who are esteemed\namong themselves, as the golden mean of that particular talent or\nvirtue. And as this varies, according as their different circumstances\nrender different qualities more or less habitual to them, their\nsentiments concerning the exact propriety of character and behaviour\nvary accordingly.\nAmong civilized nations, the virtues which are founded upon humanity,\nare more cultivated than those which are founded upon self-denial and\nthe command of the passions. Among rude and barbarous nations, it is\nquite otherwise, the virtues of self-denial are more cultivated than\nthose of humanity. The general security and happiness which prevail in\nages of civility and politeness afford little exercise to the contempt\nof danger, to patience in enduring labour, hunger, and pain. Poverty may\neasily be avoided, and the contempt of it therefore, almost ceases to be\na virtue. The abstinence from pleasure, becomes less necessary, and the\nmind is more at liberty to unbend itself, and to indulge its natural\ninclinations in all those particular respects.\nAmong savages and barbarians it is quite otherwise. Every savage\nundergoes a sort of Spartan discipline, and by the necessity of his\nsituation is inured to every sort of hardship. He is in continual\ndanger: He is often exposed to the greatest extremities of hunger, and\nfrequently dies of pure want. His circumstances not only habituate him\nto every sort of distress, but teach him to give way to none of the\npassions which that distress is apt to excite. He can expect from his\ncountrymen no sympathy or indulgence for such weakness. Before we can\nfeel much for others, we must in some measure be at ease ourselves. If\nour own misery pinches us very severely, we have no leisure to attend to\nthat of our neighbour: And all savages are too much occupied with their\nown wants and necessities, to give much attention to those of another\nperson. A savage, therefore, whatever be the nature of his distress,\nexpects no sympathy from those about him, and disdains, upon that\naccount, to expose himself, by allowing the least weakness to escape\nhim. His passions, how furious and violent soever, are never permitted\nto disturb the serenity of his countenance or the composure of his\nconduct and behaviour. The savages in North America, we are told, assume\nupon all occasions the greatest indifference, and would think themselves\ndegraded if they should ever appear in any respect to be overcome,\neither by love, or grief, or resentment. Their magnanimity and\nself-command, in this respect, are almost beyond the conception of\nEuropeans. In a country in which all men are upon a level, with regard\nto rank and fortune, it might be expected that the mutual inclinations\nof the two parties should be the only thing considered in marriages, and\nshould be indulged without any sort of controul. This, however, is the\ncountry in which all marriages, without exception, are made up by the\nparents, and in which a young man would think himself disgraced for\never, if he shewed the least preference of one woman above another, or\ndid not express the most complete indifference, both about the time\nwhen, and the person to whom he was to be married. The weakness of love,\nwhich is so much indulged in ages of humanity and politeness, is\nregarded among savages as the most unpardonable effeminacy. Even after\nthe marriage the two parties seem to be ashamed of a connexion which is\nfounded upon so sordid a necessity. They do not live together. They see\none another by stealth only. They both continue to dwell in the houses\nof their respective fathers, and the open cohabitation of the two sexes,\nwhich is permitted without blame in all other countries, is here\nconsidered as the most indecent and unmanly sensuality. Nor is it only\nover this agreeable passion that they exert this absolute self-command.\nThey often bear in the sight of all their countrymen with injuries,\nreproach, and the grossest insults with the appearance of the greatest\ninsensibility, and without expressing the smallest resentment. When a\nsavage is made prisoner of war, and receives, as is usual, the sentence\nof death from his conquerors, he hears it without expressing any\nemotion, and afterwards submits to the most dreadful torments, without\never bemoaning himself, or discovering any other passion but contempt of\nhis enemies. While he is hung by the shoulders over a slow fire, he\nderides his tormentors, and tells them with how much more ingenuity, he\nhimself had tormented such of their countrymen as had fallen into his\nhands. After he has been scorched and burnt, and lacerated in all the\nmost tender and sensible parts of his body for several hours together,\nhe is often allowed, in order to prolong his misery, a short respite,\nand is taken down from the stake: he employs this interval in talking\nupon all indifferent subjects, inquires after the news of the country,\nand seems indifferent about nothing but his own situation. The\nspectators express the same insensibility; the sight of so horrible an\nobject seems to make no impression upon them; they scarce look at the\nprisoner, except when they lend a hand to torment him. At other times\nthey smoke tobacco, and amuse themselves with any common object, as if\nno such matter was going on. Every savage is said to prepare himself\nfrom his earliest youth for this dreadful end. He composes, for this\npurpose, what they call the song of death, a song which he is to sing\nwhen he has fallen into the hands of his enemies, and is expiring under\nthe tortures which they inflict upon him. It consists of insults upon\nhis tormentors, and expresses the highest contempt of death and pain. He\nsings this song upon all extraordinary occasions, when he goes out to\nwar, when he meets his enemies in the field, or whenever he has a mind\nto show that he has familiarised his imagination to the most dreadful\nmisfortunes, and that no human event can daunt his resolution, or alter\nhis purpose. The same contempt of death and torture prevails among all\nother savage nations. There is not a negro from the coast of Africa who\ndoes not, in this respect, possess a degree of magnanimity which the\nsoul of his sordid master is too often scarce capable of conceiving.\nFortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when\nshe subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the jails of\nEurope, to wretches who possess the virtues neither of the countries\nwhich they come from, nor of those which they go to, and whose levity,\nbrutality, and baseness, so justly expose them to the contempt of the\nvanquished.\nThis heroic and unconquerable firmness, which the custom and education\nof his country demand of every savage, is not required of those who are\nbrought up to live in civilized societies. If these last complain when\nthey are in pain, if they grieve when they are in distress, if they\nallow themselves either to be overcome by love, or to be discomposed by\nanger, they are easily pardoned. Such weaknesses are not apprehended to\naffect the essential parts of their character. As long as they do not\nallow themselves to be transported to do any thing contrary to justice\nor humanity, they lose but little reputation, though the serenity of\ntheir countenance or the composure of their discourse and behaviour\nshould be somewhat ruffled and disturbed. A humane and polished people,\nwho have more sensibility to the passions of others, can more readily\nenter into an animated and passionate behaviour, and can more easily\npardon some little excess. The person principally concerned is sensible\nof this; and being assured of the equity of his judges, indulges himself\nin stronger expressions of passion, and is less afraid of exposing\nhimself to their contempt by the violence of his emotions. We can\nventure to express more emotion in the presence of a friend than in that\nof a stranger, because we expect more indulgence from the one than from\nthe other. And in the same manner the rules of decorum among civilized\nnations, admit of a more animated behaviour, than is approved of among\nbarbarians. The first converse together with the openness of friends;\nthe second with the reserve of strangers. The emotion and vivacity with\nwhich the French and the Italians, the two most polished nations upon\nthe continent, express themselves on occasions that are at all\ninteresting, surprise at first those strangers who happen to be\ntravelling among them, and who, having been educated among a people of\nduller sensibility, cannot enter into this passionate behaviour, of\nwhich they have never seen any example in their own country. A young\nFrench nobleman will weep in the presence of the whole court upon being\nrefused a regiment. An Italian, says the abbot D\u00fb Bos, expresses more\nemotion on being condemned in a fine of twenty shillings, than an\nEnglishman on receiving the sentence of death. Cicero, in the times of\nthe highest Roman politeness, could, without degrading himself, weep\nwith all the bitterness of sorrow in the sight of the whole senate and\nthe whole people; as it is evident he must have done in the end of\nalmost every oration. The orators of the earlier and ruder ages of Rome\ncould not probably, consistent with the manners of the times, have\nexpressed themselves with so much emotion. It would have been regarded,\nI suppose, as a violation of nature and propriety in the Scipios, in the\nLeliuses, and in the elder Cato, to have exposed so much tenderness to\nthe view of the public. Those ancient warriors could express themselves,\nwith order, gravity, and good judgment; but are said to have been\nstrangers to that sublime and passionate eloquence which was first\nintroduced into Rome, not many years before the birth of Cicero, by the\ntwo Gracchi, by Crassus, and by Sulpitius. This animated eloquence,\nwhich has been long practiced, with or without success, both in France\nand Italy, is but just beginning to be introduced into England. So wide\nis the difference between the degrees of self-command which are required\nin civilized and in barbarous nations, and by such different standards\ndo they judge of the propriety of behaviour.\nThis difference gives occasion to many others that are not less\nessential. A polished people being accustomed to give way, in some\nmeasure, to the movements of nature, become frank, open, and sincere.\nBarbarians, on the contrary, being obliged to smother and conceal the\nappearance of every passion, necessarily acquire the habits of falsehood\nand dissimulation. It is observed by all those who have been conversant\nwith savage nations, whether in Asia, Africa, or America, that they are\nall equally impenetrable, and that, when they have a mind to conceal the\ntruth, no examination is capable of drawing it from them. They cannot be\ntrepanned by the most artful questions. The torture itself is incapable\nof making them confess any thing which they have no mind to tell. The\npassions of a savage too, though they never express themselves by any\noutward emotion, but lie concealed in the breast of the sufferer, are,\nnotwithstanding, all mounted to the highest pitch of fury. Though he\nseldom shows any symptoms of anger, yet his vengeance, when he comes to\ngive way to it, is always sanguinary and dreadful. The least affront\ndrives him to despair. His countenance and discourse indeed are still\nsober and composed, and express nothing but the most perfect\ntranquillity of mind: But his actions are often the most furious and\nviolent. Among the North-Americans it is not uncommon for persons of the\ntenderest age and more fearful sex to drown themselves upon receiving\nonly a slight reprimand from their mothers, and this too without\nexpressing any passions or saying any thing, except, _you shall no\nlonger have a daughter_. In civilized nations the passions of men are\nnot commonly so furious or so desperate. They are often clamorous and\nnoisy, but are seldom very hurtful; and seem frequently to aim at no\nother satisfaction, but that of convincing the spectator, that they are\nin the right to be so much moved, and of procuring his sympathy and\napprobation.\nAll these effects of custom and fashion, however, upon the moral\nsentiments of mankind, are inconsiderable in comparison of those which\nthey give occasion to in some other cases; and it is not concerning the\ngeneral style of character and behaviour, that those principles produce\nthe greatest perversion of judgment, but concerning the propriety or\nimpropriety of particular usages.\nThe different manners which custom teaches us to approve of in the\ndifferent professions and states of life, do not concern things of the\ngreatest importance. We expect truth and justice from an old man as well\nas from a young, from a clergyman as well as from an officer; and it is\nin matters of small moment only that we look for the distinguishing\nmarks of their respective characters. With regard to these too, there is\noften some unobserved circumstance which, if it was attended to, would\nshow us, that, independent of custom, there was a propriety in the\ncharacter which custom had taught us to allot to each profession. We\ncannot complain, therefore, in this case, that the perversion of natural\nsentiment is very great. Though the manners of different nations require\ndifferent degrees of the same quality, in the character which they think\nworthy of esteem, yet the worst that can be said to happen even here, is\nthat the duties of one virtue are sometimes extended so as to encroach a\nlittle upon the precincts of some other. The rustic hospitality that is\nin fashion among the Poles encroaches, perhaps, a little upon \u0153conomy\nand good order; and the frugality that is esteemed in Holland, upon\ngenerosity and good-fellowship. The hardiness demanded of savages\ndiminishes their humanity; and, perhaps, the delicate sensibility\nrequired in civilized nations sometimes destroys the masculine firmness\nof the character. In general, the style of manners which takes place in\nany nation, may commonly upon the whole be said to be that which is most\nsuitable to its situation. Hardiness is the character most suitable to\nthe circumstances of a savage; sensibility to those of one who lives in\na very civilized society. Even here, therefore, we cannot complain that\nthe moral sentiments of men are very grossly perverted.\nIt is not therefore in the general style of conduct or behaviour that\ncustom authorizes the widest departure from what is the natural\npropriety of action. With regard to particular usages its influence is\noften much more destructive of good morals, and it is capable of\nestablishing, as lawful and blameless, particular actions, which shock\nthe plainest principles of right and wrong.\nCan there be greater barbarity, for example, than to hurt an infant? Its\nhelplessness, its innocence, its amiableness, call forth the compassion\neven of an enemy, and not to spare that tender age is regarded as the\nmost furious effort of an enraged and cruel conqueror. What then should\nwe imagine must be the heart of a parent who could injure that weakness\nwhich even a furious enemy is afraid to violate? Yet the exposition,\nthat is, the murder of newborn infants, was a practice allowed of in\nalmost all the states of Greece, even among the polite and civilized\nAthenians; and whenever the circumstances of the parent rendered it\ninconvenient to bring up the child, to abandon it to hunger, or to wild\nbeasts, was regarded without blame or censure. This practice had\nprobably begun in times of the most savage barbarity. The imaginations\nof men had been first made familiar with it in that earliest period of\nsociety, and the uniform continuance of the custom had hindered them\nafterwards from perceiving its enormity. We find, at this day, that this\npractice prevails among all savage nations; and in that rudest and\nlowest state of society it is undoubtedly more pardonable than in any\nother. The extreme indigence of a savage is often such that he himself\nis frequently exposed to the greatest extremity of hunger, he often dies\nof pure want, and it is frequently impossible for him to support both\nhimself and his child. We cannot wonder, therefore, that in this case he\nshould abandon it. One who in flying from an enemy, whom it was\nimpossible to resist, should throw down his infant, because it retarded\nhis flight, would surely be excusable; since, by attempting to save it,\nhe could only hope for the consolation of dying with it. That in this\nstate of society, therefore, a parent should be allowed to judge whether\nhe can bring up his child, ought not to surprise us so greatly. In the\nlatter ages of Greece, however, the same thing was permitted from views\nof remote interest or conveniency, which could by no means excuse it.\nUninterrupted custom had by this time so thoroughly authorized the\npractice, that not only the loose maxims of the world tolerated this\nbarbarous prerogative, but even the doctrine of philosophers, which\nought to have been more just and accurate, was led away by the\nestablished custom, and upon this, as upon many other occasions, instead\nof censuring, supported the horrible abuse, by far-fetched\nconsiderations of public utility. Aristotle talks of it as of what the\nmagistrate ought upon many occasions to encourage. The humane Plato is\nof the same opinion, and, with all that love of mankind which seems to\nanimate all his writings, no where marks this practice with\ndisapprobation. When custom can give sanction to so dreadful a violation\nof humanity, we may well imagine that there is scarce any particular\npractice so gross which it cannot authorize. Such a thing, we hear men\nevery day saying, is commonly done, and they seem to think this a\nsufficient apology for what, in itself, is the most unjust and\nunreasonable conduct.\nThere is an obvious reason why custom should never pervert our\nsentiments with regard to the general style and character of conduct and\nbehaviour, in the same degree as with regard to the propriety or\nunlawfulness of particular usages. There never can be any such custom.\nNo society could subsist a moment, in which the usual strain of mens\nconduct and behaviour was of a piece with the horrible practice I just\nnow mentioned.\n[Illustration]\nPART VI.\nOf Systems of MORAL PHILOSOPHY.\nCONSISTING OF FOUR SECTIONS.\nSECTION I.\nOf the questions which ought to be examined in a theory of moral\nsentiments.\nIf we examine the most celebrated and remarkable of the different\ntheories which have been given concerning the nature and origin of our\nmoral sentiments, we shall find that almost all of them coincide with\nsome part or other of that which I have been endeavouring to give an\naccount of; and that if every thing which has already been said be fully\nconsidered, we shall be at no loss to explain what was the view or\naspect of nature which led each particular author to form his particular\nsystem. From some one or other of those principles which I have been\nendeavouring to unfold, every system of morality that ever had any\nreputation in the world has, perhaps, ultimately been derived. As they\nare all of them, in this respect, founded upon natural principles, they\nare all of them in some measure in the right. But as many of them are\nderived from a partial and imperfect view of nature, there are many of\nthem too in some respects in the wrong.\nIn treating of the principles of morals there are two questions to be\nconsidered. First, wherein does virtue consist? Or what is the tone of\ntemper, and tenour of conduct, which constitutes the excellent and\npraise-worthy character, the character which is the natural object of\nesteem, honour, and approbation? and secondly, by what power or faculty\nin the mind is it, that this character, whatever it be, is recommended\nto us? Or in other words, how and by what means does it come to pass,\nthat the mind prefers one tenour of conduct to another, denominates the\none right and the other wrong; considers the one as the object of\napprobation, honour, and reward, and the other of blame, censure, and\npunishment?\nWe examine the first question when we consider whether virtue consists\nin benevolence, as Dr. Hutcheson imagines; or in acting suitably to the\ndifferent relations we stand in, as Dr. Clarke supposes; or in the wise\nand prudent pursuit of our own real and solid happiness, as has been the\nopinion of others.\nWe examine the second question, when we consider, whether the virtuous\ncharacter, whatever it consists in, be recommended to us by self-love,\nwhich makes us perceive that this character, both in ourselves and\nothers, tends most to promote our own private interest or by reason,\nwhich points out to us the difference between one character and another,\nin the same manner as it does that between truth and falsehood; or by a\npeculiar power of perception, called a moral sense, which this virtuous\ncharacter gratifies and pleases, as the contrary disgusts and displeases\nit; or last of all, by some other principle in human nature, such as a\nmodification of sympathy, or the like.\nI shall begin with considering the systems which have been formed\nconcerning the first of these questions, and shall proceed afterwards to\nexamine those concerning the second.\n[Illustration]\nSECTION II.\nOf the different accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue.\nINTRODUCTION.\nThe different accounts which have been given of the nature of virtue, or\nof the temper of mind which constitutes the excellent and praise-worthy\ncharacter, may be reduced to three different classes. According to some,\nthe virtuous temper of mind does not consist in any one species of\naffections, but in the proper government and direction of all our\naffections, which may be either virtuous or vicious according to the\nobjects which they pursue, and the degree of vehemence with which they\npursue them. According to these authors, therefore, virtue consists in\npropriety.\nAccording to others, virtue consists in the judicious pursuit of our own\nprivate interest and happiness, or in the proper government and\ndirection of those selfish affections which aim solely at this end. In\nthe opinion of these authors, therefore, virtue consists in prudence.\nAnother set of authors make virtue consist in those affections only\nwhich aim at the happiness of others, not in those which aim at our own.\nAccording to them, therefore, disinterested benevolence is the only\nmotive which can stamp upon any action the character of virtue.\nThe character of virtue, it is evident, must either be ascribed\nindifferently to all our affections, when under proper government and\ndirection; or it must be confined to some one class or division of them.\nThe great division of our affections is into the selfish and the\nbenevolent. If the character of virtue, therefore, cannot be ascribed\nindifferently to all our affections, when under proper government and\ndirection, it must be confined either to those which aim directly at our\nown private happiness, or to those which aim directly at that of others.\nIf virtue, therefore, does not consist in propriety, it must consist\neither in prudence or in benevolence. Besides these three, it is scarce\npossible to imagine that any other account can be given of the nature of\nvirtue. I shall endeavour to shew hereafter how all the other accounts,\nwhich are seemingly different from any of these, coincide at bottom with\nsome one or other of them.\nCHAP. I.\n_Of those systems which make virtue consist in propriety._\nAccording to Plato, to Aristotle, and to Zeno, virtue consists in the\npropriety of conduct, or in the suitableness of the affection from which\nwe act to the object which excites it.\nI. In the system of Plato[8] the soul is considered as something like a\nlittle state or republic, composed of three different faculties or\norders.\nFootnote 8:\nSee Plato de Rep. lib. iv.\nThe first is the judging faculty, the faculty which determines not only\nwhat are the proper means for attaining any end, but also what ends are\nfit to be pursued, and what degree of relative value we ought to put\nupon each. This faculty Plato called, as it is very properly called\nreason, and considered it as what had a right to be the governing\nprinciple of the whole. Under this appellation, it is evident, he\ncomprehended not only that faculty by which we judge of truth and\nfalsehood, but that by which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of\ndesires and affections.\nThe different passions and appetites, the natural subject of this ruling\nprinciple, but which are so apt to rebel against their master, he\nreduced to two different classes or orders. The first consisted of those\npassions, which are founded in pride and resentment, or in what the\nschoolmen called the irascible part of the soul; ambition, animosity,\nthe love of honour, and the dread of shame, the desire of victory,\nsuperiority, and revenge; all those passions, in short, which are\nsupposed either to rise from, or to denote what, by a metaphor in our\nlanguage, we commonly call spirit or natural fire. The second consisted\nof those passions which are founded in the love of pleasure, or in what\nthe schoolmen called the concupiscible part of the soul. It comprehended\nall the appetites of the body, the love of ease and security, and of all\nsensual gratifications.\nIt rarely happens that we break in upon that plan of conduct, which the\ngoverning principle prescribes, and which in all our cool hours we had\nlaid down to ourselves as what was most proper for us to pursue, but\nwhen prompted by one or other of those two different sets of passions;\neither by ungovernable ambition and resentment, or by the importunate\nsolicitations of present ease and pleasure. But though these two orders\nof passions are so apt to mislead us, they are still considered as\nnecessary parts of human nature: the first having been given to defend\nus against injuries, to assert our rank and dignity in the world, to\nmake us aim at what is noble and honourable, and to make us distinguish\nthose who act in the same manner; the second to provide for the support\nand necessities of the body.\nIn the strength, acuteness, and perfection of the governing principle\nwas placed the essential virtue of prudence, which, according to Plato,\nconsisted in a just and clear discernment, founded upon general and\nscientific ideas, of the ends which were proper to be pursued, and of\nthe means which were proper for attaining them.\nWhen the first set of passions, those of the irascible part of the soul,\nhad that degree of strength and firmness, which enabled them, under the\ndirection of reason, to despise all dangers in the pursuit of what was\nhonourable and noble; it constituted the virtue of fortitude and\nmagnanimity. This order of passions, according to this system, was of a\nmore generous and noble nature than the other. They were considered upon\nmany occasions as the auxiliaries of reason, to check and restrain the\ninferior and brutal appetites. We are often angry at ourselves, it was\nobserved, we often become the objects of our own resentment and\nindignation, when the love of pleasure prompts to do what we disapprove\nof; and the irascible part of our nature is in this manner called in to\nassist the rational against the concupiscible.\nWhen all those three different parts of our nature were in perfect\nconcord with one another, when neither the irascible nor concupiscible\npassions ever aimed at any gratification which reason did not approve\nof, and when reason never commanded any thing, but what these of their\nown accord were willing to perform; this happy composure, this perfect\nand complete harmony of soul, constituted that virtue which in their\nlanguage is expressed by a word which we commonly translate temperance,\nbut which might more properly be translated good temper, or sobriety and\nmoderation of mind.\nJustice, the last and greatest of the four cardinal virtues, took place,\naccording to this system, when each of those three faculties of the mind\nconfined itself to its proper office, without attempting to encroach\nupon that of any other; when reason directed and passion obeyed, and\nwhen each passion performed its proper duty, and exerted itself towards\nits proper object easily and without reluctance, and with that degree of\nforce and energy, which was suitable to the value of what it pursued. In\nthis consisted that complete virtue, that perfect propriety of conduct,\nwhich Plato, after some of the ancient Pythagoreans, denominated\nJustice.\nThe word, it is to be observed, which expresses justice in the Greek\nlanguage, has several different meanings; and as the correspondent word\nin all other languages, so far as I know, has the same, there must be\nsome natural affinity among those various significations. In one sense\nwe are said to do justice to our neighbour when we abstain from doing\nhim any positive harm, and do not directly hurt him, either in his\nperson, or in his estate, or in his reputation. This is that justice\nwhich I have treated of above, the observance of which may be extorted\nby force, and the violation of which exposes to punishment. In another\nsense we are said not to do justice to our neighbour unless we conceive\nfor him all that love, respect and esteem, which his character, his\nsituation, and his connexion with ourselves, render suitable and proper\nfor us to feel, and unless we act accordingly. It is in this sense that\nwe are said to do injustice to a man of merit who is connected with us,\ntho\u2019 we abstain from hurting him in every respect, if we do not exert\nourselves to serve him and to place him in that situation in which the\nimpartial spectator would be pleased to see him. The first sense of the\nword coincides with what Aristotle and the Schoolmen call commutative\njustice, and with what Grotius calls the _justitia expletrix_, which\nconsists in abstaining from what is another\u2019s, and in doing voluntarily\nwhatever we can with propriety be forced to do. The second sense of the\nword coincides with what some have called distributive justice[9], and\nwith the _justitia attributrix_ of Grotius, which consists in proper\nbeneficence, in the becoming use of what is our own, and in the applying\nit to those purposes either of charity or generosity, to which it is\nmost suitable, in our situation, that it should be applied. In this\nsense justice comprehends all the social virtues. There is yet another\nsense in which the word justice is sometimes taken, still more extensive\nthan either of the former, though very much akin to the last; and which\nruns too, so far as I know, through all languages. It is in this last\nsense that we are said to be unjust, when we do not seem to value any\nparticular object with that degree of esteem, or to pursue it with that\ndegree of ardour which to the impartial spectator it may appear to\ndeserve or to be naturally fitted for exciting. Thus we are said to do\ninjustice to a poem or a picture, when we do not admire them enough, and\nwe are said to do them more than justice when we admire them too much.\nIn the same manner we are said to do injustice to ourselves when we\nappear not to give sufficient attention to any particular object of\nself-interest. In this last sense, what is called justice means the same\nthing with exact and perfect propriety of conduct and behaviour, and\ncomprehends in it, not only the offices of both commutative and\ndistributive justice, but of every other virtue, of prudence, of\nfortitude, of temperance. It is in this last sense that Plato evidently\nunderstands what he calls justice, and which, therefore, according to\nhim, comprehends in it the perfection of every sort of virtue.\nFootnote 9:\nThe distributive justice of Aristotle is somewhat different. It\nconsists in the proper distribution of rewards from the public stock\nof a community. See Aristotle Ethic. Nic. l. 5. c. 2.\nSuch is the account given by Plato of the nature of virtue, or of that\ntemper of mind which is the proper object of praise and approbation. It\nconsists, according to him, in that state of mind in which every faculty\nconfines itself within its proper sphere without encroaching upon that\nof any other, and performs its proper office with that precise degree of\nstrength and vigour which belongs to it. His account, it is evident,\ncoincides in every respect with what we have said above concerning the\npropriety of conduct.\nII. Virtue, according to Aristotle[10], consists in the habit of\nmediocrity according to right reason. Every particular virtue, according\nto him, lies in a kind of middle between two opposite vices, of which\nthe one offends from being too much, the other from being too little\naffected by a particular species of objects. Thus the virtue of\nfortitude or courage lies in the middle between the opposite vices of\ncowardice and of presumptuous rashness, of which the one offends from\nbeing too much, and the other from being too little affected by the\nobjects of fear. Thus too the virtue of frugality lies in a middle\nbetween avarice and profusion, of which the one consists in an excess,\nthe other in a defect of the proper attention to the objects of self\ninterest. Magnanimity, in the same manner, lies in a middle between the\nexcess of arrogance and the defect of pusillanimity, of which the one\nconsists in too extravagant, the other in too weak a sentiment of our\nown worth and dignity. It is unnecessary to observe that this account of\nvirtue corresponds too pretty exactly with what has been said above\nconcerning the propriety and impropriety of conduct.\nFootnote 10:\nSee Aristotle Ethic. Nic. l. 2. c. 5. et seq. et l. 3. c. 5. et seq.\nAccording to Aristotle[11], indeed, virtue did not so much consist in\nthose moderate and right affections, as in the habit of this moderation.\nIn order to understand this, it is to be observed, that virtue may be\nconsidered either as the quality of an action, or as the quality of a\nperson. Considered as the quality of an action, it consists, even\naccording to Aristotle, in the reasonable moderation of the affection\nfrom which the action proceeds, whether this disposition be habitual to\nthe person or not. Considered as the quality of a person, it consists in\nthe habit of this reasonable moderation, in its having become the\ncustomary and usual disposition of the mind. Thus the action which\nproceeds from an occasional fit of generosity is undoubtedly a generous\naction, but the man who performs it, is not necessarily a generous\nperson, because it may be the single action of the kind which he ever\nperformed. The motive and disposition of heart, from which this action\nwas performed, may have been quite just and proper: but as this happy\nmood seems to have been the effect rather of accidental humour than of\nany thing steady or permanent in the character, it can reflect no great\nhonour on the performer. When we denominate a character generous or\ncharitable, or virtuous in any respect, we mean to signify that the\ndisposition expressed by each of those appellations is the usual and\ncustomary disposition of the person. But single actions of any kind, how\nproper and suitable soever, are of little consequence to show that this\nis the case. If a single action was sufficient to stamp the character of\nany virtue upon the person who performed it, the most worthless of\nmankind might lay claim to all the virtues; since there is no man who\nhas not, upon some occasions, acted with prudence, justice, temperance,\nand fortitude. But though single actions, how laudable soever, reflect\nvery little praise upon the person who performs them, a single vicious\naction performed by one whose conduct is usually very regular, greatly\ndiminishes and sometimes destroys altogether our opinion of his virtue.\nA single action of this kind sufficiently shows that his habits are not\nperfect, and that he is less to be depended upon, than, from the usual\ntrain of his behaviour, we might have been apt to imagine.\nFootnote 11:\nSee Aristotle Ethic. Nic. lib. ii. ch. 1., 2., 3. and 4.\nAristotle too[12], when he made virtue to consist in practical habits,\nhad it probably in his view to oppose the doctrine of Plato, who seems\nto have been of opinion that just sentiments and reasonable judgments\nconcerning what was fit to be done or to be avoided, were alone\nsufficient to constitute the most perfect virtue. Virtue, according to\nPlato, might be considered as a species of science, and no man, he\nthought, could see clearly and demonstratively what was right and what\nwas wrong, and not act accordingly. Passion might make us act contrary\nto doubtful and uncertain opinions, not to plain and evident judgments.\nAristotle, on the contrary, was of opinion, that no conviction of the\nunderstanding was capable of getting the better of inveterate habits,\nand that good morals arose not from knowledge but from action.\nFootnote 12:\nSee Aristotle Mag. Mor. lib. i. ch. 1.\nIII. According to Zeno[13], the founder of the stoical doctrine, every\nanimal was by nature recommended to its own care, and was endowed with\nthe principle of self-love, that it might endeavour to preserve, not\nonly its existence, but all the different parts of its nature, in the\nbest and most perfect state of which they were capable.\nFootnote 13:\nSee Cicero de finibus, lib. iii. also Diogenes Laertius in Zenone,\nlib. vii. segment 84.\nThe self-love of man embraced, if I may say so, his body and all its\ndifferent members, his mind and all its different faculties and powers,\nand desired the preservation and maintenance of them all in their best\nand most perfect condition. Whatever tended to support this state of\nexistence was, therefore, by nature pointed out to him as fit to be\nchosen; and whatever tended to destroy it, as fit to be rejected. Thus\nhealth, strength, agility, and ease of body, as well as the external\nconveniencies which could promote these, wealth, power, honours, the\nrespect and esteem of those we live with, were naturally pointed out to\nus as things eligible, and of which the possession was preferable to the\ncontrary. On the other hand, sickness, infirmity, unwieldiness, pain of\nbody, as well as all the external inconveniencies which tended to\noccasion or bring on any of them, poverty, the want of authority, the\ncontempt or hatred of those we live with; were, in the same manner,\npointed out to us as things to be shunned and avoided. In each of those\ntwo different classes of objects there were some which appeared to be\nmore the objects either of choice or rejection than others in the same\nclass. Thus, in the first class, health appeared evidently preferable to\nstrength, and strength to agility; reputation to power, and power to\nriches. And thus too, in the second class, sickness was more to be\navoided than unwieldiness of body, ignominy than poverty, and poverty\nthan the want of authority. Virtue and the propriety of conduct\nconsisted in choosing and rejecting all different objects and\ncircumstances according as they were by nature rendered more or less the\nobjects of choice or rejection; in selecting always from among the\nseveral objects of choice presented to us, that which was most to be\nchosen, when we could not obtain them all: and in selecting too out of\nthe several objects of rejection offered to us, that which was least to\nbe avoided, when it was not in our power to avoid them all. By choosing\nand rejecting with this just and accurate discernment, by thus bestowing\nupon every object the precise degree of attention it deserved, according\nto the place which it held in this natural scale of things, we\nmaintained, according to the Stoics, that perfect rectitude of conduct\nwhich constituted the essence of virtue. This was what they called to\nlive consistently, to live according to nature, and to obey those laws\nand directions which nature, or the Author of nature, had prescribed for\nour conduct.\nSo far the Stoical idea of propriety and virtue is not very different\nfrom that of Aristotle and the ancient peripatetics. What chiefly\ndistinguished those two systems from one another was the different\ndegrees of self-command which they required. The peripatetics allowed of\nsome degree of perturbation as suitable to the weakness of human nature,\nand as useful to so imperfect a creature as man. If his own misfortunes\nexcited no passionate grief, if his own injuries called forth no lively\nresentment, reason, or a regard to the general rules which determined\nwhat was right and fit to be done, would commonly, they thought, be too\nweak to prompt him to avoid the one or to beat off the other. The\nStoics, on the contrary, demanded the most perfect apathy, and regarded\nevery emotion which could in the smallest degree disturb the\ntranquillity of the mind, as the effect of levity and folly. The\nPeripatetics seem to have thought that no passion exceeded the bounds of\npropriety as long as the spectator, by the utmost effort of humanity,\ncould sympathize with it. The Stoics, on the contrary, appear to have\nregarded every passion as improper, which made any demand upon the\nsympathy of the spectator, or required him to alter in any respect the\nnatural and ordinary state of his mind, in order to keep time with the\nvehemence of its emotions. A man of virtue, they seem to have thought,\nought not to depend upon the generosity of those he lives with for\npardon or approbation.\nAccording to the Stoics, every event should, to a wise man, appear\nindifferent, and what for its own sake could be the object neither of\ndesire, nor aversion, neither of joy, nor sorrow. If he preferred some\nevents to others, if some situations were the objects of his choice, and\nothers of his rejection,[14] it was not, because he regarded the one as,\nin themselves, in any respect better than the other, or thought that his\nown happiness would be more complete in, what is called, the fortunate,\nthan in what is commonly regarded as the distressful situation; but\nbecause the propriety of action, the rule which the gods had given him\nfor the direction of his conduct, required him to choose and reject in\nthis manner. Among the primary objects of natural inclination, or among\nthose things which nature had originally recommended to us as eligible,\nwas the prosperity, of our family, of our relations, of our friends, of\nour country, of mankind, and of the universe in general. Nature too had\ntaught us that as the prosperity of two was preferable to that of one,\nthat of many or of all must be infinitely more so. That we ourselves\nwere but one, and that consequently wherever our prosperity was\ninconsistent with that, either of the whole, or of any considerable part\nof the whole, it ought, even in our own choice, to yield to what was so\nvastly preferable. As all the events in this world were conducted by the\nprovidence of a wise, powerful and good God, we might be assured that\nwhatever happened, tended to the prosperity and perfection of the whole,\nif we ourselves, therefore, were in poverty, in sickness, or in any\nother calamity, we ought, first of all, to use our utmost endeavours, so\nfar as justice and our duty to others would allow, to rescue ourselves\nfrom this disagreeable circumstance. But if after all we could do, we\nfound this impossible, we ought to rest satisfied that the order and\nperfection of the universe required that we should in the mean time\ncontinue in this situation. And as the prosperity of the whole should,\neven to us, appear preferable to so insignificant a part as ourselves,\nour situation, whatever it was, ought from that moment to become the\nobject of our choice, and even of our desire, if we would maintain that\ncomplete propriety and rectitude of sentiment and conduct in which the\nperfection of our nature consists. If, indeed, any opportunity of\nextricating ourselves should offer, it became our duty to embrace it.\nThe order of the universe, it was evident, no longer required our\ncontinuance in this situation, and the great director of the world\nplainly called upon us to leave it, by so clearly pointing out the road\nwhich we were to follow. It was the same case with the adversity of our\nrelations, our friends, our country. If without violating any more\nsacred obligation, it was in our power to prevent or to put an end to\ntheir calamity, it undoubtedly was our duty to do so. The propriety of\naction, the rule which Jupiter had given us for the direction of our\nconduct, evidently required this of us. But if it was altogether out of\nour power to do either, we ought then to consider this event as the most\nfortunate which could possibly have happened: Because we might be\nassured that it tended most to the prosperity and order of the whole:\nwhich was what we ourselves, if we were wise and equitable, ought most\nof all to desire. \u201cIn what sense, says Epictetus, are some things said\nto be according to our nature, and others contrary to it? It is in that\nsense in which we consider ourselves as separated and detached from all\nother things. For thus it may be said to be according to the nature of\nthe foot to be always clean. But if you consider it as a foot, and not\nas something detached from the rest of the body, it must behove it\nsometimes to trample in the dirt, and sometimes to tread upon thorns,\nand sometimes too to be cut off for the sake of the whole body; and if\nit refuses this, it is no longer a foot. Thus too ought we to conceive\nwith regard to ourselves. What are you? A man. If you consider yourself\nas something separated and detached, it is agreeable to your nature to\nlive to old age, to be rich, to be in health. But if you consider\nyourself as a man, and as a part of a whole, upon account of that whole\nit will behoove you sometimes to be in sickness, sometimes to be exposed\nto the inconveniency of a sea voyage, sometimes to be in want; and at\nlast, perhaps, to die before your time. Why then do you complain? Don\u2019t\nyou know that by doing so, as the foot ceases to be a foot, so you cease\nto be a man?\u201d[15]\nFootnote 14:\nSome of these expressions sound a little awkward in the English\nlanguage: they are literal translations of the technical terms of the\nStoics.\nFootnote 15:\nArrian. lib. II. c. 5.\nThis submission to the order of the universe, this entire indifference\nwith regard to whatever concerns ourselves, when put into the balance\nwith the interest of the whole, could derive its propriety, it is\nevident, from no other principle besides that, upon which I have\nendeavoured to show, the propriety of justice was founded. As long as we\nview our own interests with our own eyes, it is scarce possible that we\nshould willingly acquiesce in their being thus sacrificed to the\ninterests of the whole. It is only when we view those opposite interests\nwith the eyes of others, that what concerns ourselves can appear to be\nso contemptible in the comparison, as to be resigned without any\nreluctance. To every body but the person principally concerned, nothing\ncan appear more agreeable to reason and propriety than that the part\nshould give place to the whole. But what is agreeable to the reason of\nall other men, ought not to appear contrary to his. He himself therefore\nought to approve of this sacrifice, and acknowledge its conformity to\nreason. But all the affections of a wise man, according to the stoics,\nare perfectly agreeable to reason and propriety, and of their own accord\ncoincide with whatever these ruling principles prescribe. A wise man,\ntherefore, could never feel any reluctance to comply with this\ndisposition of things.\nIV. Besides these ancient, there are some modern systems, according to\nwhich virtue consists in propriety; or in the suitableness of the\naffection from which we act, to the cause or object which excites it.\nThe system of Dr. Clarke, which places virtue in acting according to the\nrelations of things, in regulating our conduct according to the fitness\nor incongruity which there may be in the application of certain actions\nto certain things, or to certain relations: That of Mr. Woolaston, which\nplaces it in acting according to the truth of things, according to their\nproper nature and essence, or in treating them as what they really are,\nand not as what they are not: that of my lord Shaftesbury, which places\nit in maintaining a proper balance of the affections, and in allowing no\npassion to go beyond its proper sphere; are all of them more or less\ninaccurate descriptions of the same fundamental idea.\nThe description of virtue which is either given, or at least meant and\nintended to be given in each of those systems, for some of the modern\nauthors are not very fortunate in their manner of expressing themselves,\nis no doubt quite just, so far as it goes. There is no virtue without\npropriety, and wherever there is propriety, some degree of approbation\nis due. But still this description is imperfect. For though propriety is\nan essential ingredient in every virtuous action, it is not always the\nsole ingredient. Beneficent actions have in them another quality by\nwhich they appear not only to deserve approbation but recompense. None\nof those systems account either easily or sufficiently for that superior\ndegree of esteem which seems due to such actions, or for that diversity\nof sentiment which they naturally excite. Neither is the description of\nvice more complete. For in the same manner, though impropriety is a\nnecessary ingredient in every vicious action, it is not always the sole\ningredient, and there is often the highest degree of absurdity and\nimpropriety in very harmless and insignificant actions. Deliberate\nactions, of a pernicious tendency to those we live with, have, besides\ntheir impropriety, a peculiar quality of their own by which they appear\nto deserve, not only disapprobation, but punishment; and to be the\nobjects, not of dislike merely, but of resentment and revenge: and none\nof those systems easily and sufficiently account for that superior\ndegree of detestation which we feel for such actions.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of those systems which make virtue consist in prudence._\nThe most ancient of those systems which make virtue consist in prudence,\nand of which any considerable remains have come down to us, is that of\nEpicurus, who is said, however, to have borrowed all the leading\nprinciples of his philosophy, from some of those who had gone before\nhim, particularly From Aristippus; though it is very probable,\nnotwithstanding this allegation of his enemies, that at least his manner\nof applying those principles was altogether his own.\nAccording to Epicurus,[16] bodily pleasure and pain were the sole\nultimate objects of natural desire and aversion. That they were always\nthe natural objects of those passions, he thought required no proof.\nPleasure might, indeed, appear sometimes to be avoided; not, however,\nbecause it was pleasure, but because, by the enjoyment of it, we should\neither forfeit some greater pleasure, or expose ourselves to some pain\nthat was more to be avoided than this pleasure was to be desired. Pain,\nin the same manner, might appear sometimes to be eligible; not, however,\nbecause it was pain, but because by enduring it we might either avoid a\nstill greater pain, or acquire some pleasure of much more importance.\nThat bodily pain and pleasure, therefore, were always the natural\nobjects of desire and aversion, was, he thought, abundantly evident. Nor\nwas it less so, he imagined, that they were the sole ultimate objects of\nthose passions. Whatever else was either desired or avoided was so,\naccording to him, upon account of its tendency to produce one or other\nof those sensations. The tendency to procure pleasure rendered power and\nriches desirable, as the contrary tendency to produce pain made poverty\nand insignificancy the objects of aversion. Honour and reputation were\nvalued, because the esteem and love of those we live with were of the\ngreatest consequence both to procure pleasure and to defend us from\npain. Ignominy and bad fame, on the contrary, were to be avoided,\nbecause the hatred, contempt, and resentment of those we lived with\ndestroyed all security, and necessarily exposed us to the greatest\nbodily evils.\nFootnote 16:\nSee Cicero de finibus, lib. i. Diogenes Laert. 1. x.\nAll the pleasures and pains of the mind were, according to Epicurus,\nultimately derived from those of the body. The mind was happy when it\nthought of the past pleasures of the body, and hoped for others to come:\nand it was miserable when it thought of the pains which the body had\nformerly endured, and dreaded the same or greater thereafter.\nBut the pleasures and pains of the mind, though ultimately derived from\nthose of the body, were vastly greater than their originals. The body\nfelt only the sensation of the present instant, whereas the mind felt\nalso the past and the future, the one by remembrance, the other by\nanticipation, and consequently both suffered and enjoyed much more. When\nwe are under the greatest bodily pain, he observed, we shall always\nfind, if we attend to it, that it is not the suffering of the present\ninstant which chiefly torments us, but either the agonizing remembrance\nof the past, or the yet more horrible dread of the future. The pain of\neach instant, considered by itself, and cut off from all that goes\nbefore and all that comes after it, is a trifle not worth the regarding.\nYet this is all which the body can ever be said to suffer. In the same\nmanner, when we enjoy the greatest pleasure, we shall always find that\nthe bodily sensation, the sensation of the present instant makes but a\nsmall part of our happiness, that our enjoyment chiefly arises either\nfrom the chearful recollection of the past, or the still more joyous\nanticipation of the future, and that the mind always contributes by much\nthe largest share of the entertainment.\nSince our happiness and misery, therefore, depended chiefly on the mind,\nif this part of our nature was well disposed, if our thoughts and\nopinions were as they should be, it was of little importance in what\nmanner our body was affected. Though under great bodily pain, we might\nstill enjoy a considerable share of happiness, if our reason and\njudgment maintained their superiority. We might entertain ourselves with\nthe remembrance of past, and with the hopes of future pleasure; we might\nsoften the rigour of our pains, by recollecting what it was which, even\nin this situation, we were under any necessity of suffering. That this\nwas merely the bodily sensation, the pain of the present instant, which\nby itself could never be very great. That whatever agony we suffered\nfrom the dread of its continuance was the effect of an opinion of the\nmind, which might be corrected by juster sentiments; by considering\nthat, if our pains were violent, they would probably be of short\nduration; and that if they were of long continuance, they would probably\nbe moderate, and admit of many intervals of ease; and that, at any rate,\ndeath was always at hand and within call to deliver us, which as,\naccording to him, it put an end to all sensation, either of pain or\npleasure, could not be regarded as an evil. When we are, said he, death\nis not; and when death is, we are not; death therefore can be nothing to\nus.\nIf the actual sensation of positive pain was in itself so little to be\nfeared, that of pleasure was still less to be desired. Naturally the\nsensation of pleasure was much less pungent than that of pain. If,\ntherefore, this last could take so very little from the happiness of a\nwell-disposed mind, the other could add scarce any thing to it. When the\nbody was free from pain and the mind from fear and anxiety, the\nsuperadded sensation of bodily pleasure could be of very little\nimportance; and though it might diversify, could not be properly be said\nto increase the happiness of this situation.\nIn ease of body, therefore, and in security or tranquillity of mind,\nconsisted, according to Epicurus, the most perfect state of human\nnature, the most complete happiness which man was capable of enjoying.\nTo obtain this great end of natural desire was the sole object of all\nthe virtues, which, according to him, were not desirable upon their own\naccount, but upon account of their tendency to bring about this\nsituation.\nPrudence, for example, though according to this philosophy, the source\nand principle of all the virtues, was not desirable upon its own\naccount. That careful and laborious and circumspect state of mind, ever\nwatchful and ever attentive to the most distant consequences of every\naction, could not be a thing pleasant or agreeable for its own sake, but\nupon account of its tendency to procure the greatest goods and to keep\noff the greatest evils.\nTo abstain from pleasure too, to curb and restrain our natural passions\nfor enjoyment, which was the office of temperance, could never be\ndesirable for its own sake. The whole value of this virtue arose from\nits utility, from its enabling us to postpone the present enjoyment for\nthe sake of a greater to come, or to avoid a greater pain that might\nensue from it. Temperance, in short, was nothing but prudence with\nregard to pleasure.\nTo support labour, to endure pain, to be exposed to danger or to death,\nthe situations which fortitude would often lead us into, were surely\nstill less the objects of natural desire. They were chosen only to avoid\ngreater evils. We submitted to labour, in order to avoid the greater\nshame and pain of poverty, and we exposed ourselves to danger and to\ndeath in defence of our liberty and property, the means and instruments\nof pleasure and happiness; or in defence of our country, in the safety\nof which our own was necessarily comprehended. Fortitude enabled us to\ndo all this chearfully, as the best which, in our present situation,\ncould possibly be done, and was in reality no more than prudence, good\njudgment, and presence of mind in properly appreciating pain, labour,\nand danger, always choosing the less in order to avoid the greater.\nIt is the same case with justice. To abstain from what is anothers was\nnot desirable on its own account, and it could not surely be better for\nyou, that I should possess what is my own, than that you should possess\nit. You ought however, to abstain from whatever belongs to me, because\nby doing otherwise you will provoke the resentment and indignation of\nmankind. The security and tranquillity of your mind will be entirely\ndestroyed. You will be filled with fear and consternation at the thought\nof that punishment which you will imagine that men are at all times\nready to inflict upon you, and from which no power, no art, no\nconcealment, will ever, in your own fancy, be sufficient to protect you.\nThat other species of justice which consists in doing proper good\noffices to different persons, according to the various relations of\nneighbours, kinsmen, friends, benefactors, superiors, or equals, which\nthey may stand in to us, is recommended by the same reasons. To act\nproperly in all these different relations procures us the esteem and\nlove of those we live with; as to do otherwise excites their contempt\nand hatred. By the one we naturally secure, by the other we necessarily\nendanger our own ease and tranquillity, the great and ultimate objects\nof all our desires. The whole virtue of justice, therefore, the most\nimportant of all the virtues, is no more than discreet and prudent\nconduct with regard to our neighbours.\nSuch is the doctrine of Epicurus concerning the nature of virtue. It may\nseem extraordinary that this philosopher, who is described as a person\nof the most amiable manners, should never have observed, that, whatever\nmay be the tendency of those virtues, or of the contrary vices, with\nregard to our bodily ease and security, the sentiments which they\nnaturally excite in others are the objects of a much more passionate\ndesire or aversion than all their other consequences; That to be\namiable, to be respectable, to be the proper object of esteem, is by\nevery well-disposed mind more valued than all the ease and security\nwhich love, respect, and esteem can procure us; That, on the contrary,\nto be odious, to be contemptible, to be the proper object of\nindignation, is more dreadful than all that we can suffer in our body\nfrom hatred, contempt, or indignation; and that consequently our desire\nof the one character, and our aversion to the other, cannot arise from\nany regard to the effects which either of them is likely to produce upon\nthe body.\nThis system is, no doubt, altogether inconsistent with that which I have\nbeen endeavouring to establish. It is not difficult, however, to\ndiscover from what phasis, if I may say so, from what particular view or\naspect of nature, this account of things derives its probability. By the\nwise contrivance of the Author of nature, virtue is upon all ordinary\noccasions, even with regard to this life, real wisdom, and the surest\nand readiest means of obtaining both safety and advantage. Our success\nor disappointment in our undertakings must very much depend upon the\ngood or bad opinion which is commonly entertained of us, and upon the\ngeneral disposition of those we live with, either to assist or to oppose\nus. But the best, the surest, the easiest, and the readiest way of\nobtaining the advantageous and of avoiding the unfavourable judgments of\nothers, is undoubtedly to render ourselves the proper objects of the\nformer and not of the latter. \u201cDo you desire, said Socrates, the\nreputation of a good musician? The only sure way of obtaining it, is to\nbecome a good musician. Would you desire in the same manner to be\nthought capable of serving your country either as a general or as a\nstatesman? The best way in this case too is really to acquire the art\nand experience of war and government, and to become really fit to be a\ngeneral or a statesman. And in the same manner if you would be reckoned\nsober, temperate, just, and equitable, the best way of acquiring this\nreputation is to become sober, temperate, just, and equitable. If you\ncan really render yourself amiable, respectable, and the proper object\nof esteem, there is no fear of your not soon acquiring the love, the\nrespect, and esteem of those you live with.\u201d Since the practice of\nvirtue, therefore, is in general so advantageous, and that of vice so\ncontrary to our interest, the consideration of those opposite tendencies\nundoubtedly stamps an additional beauty and propriety upon the one, and\na new deformity and impropriety upon the other. Temperance, magnanimity,\njustice, and beneficence, come thus to be approved of, not only under\ntheir proper characters, but under the additional character of the\nhighest wisdom and most real prudence. And in the same manner the\ncontrary vices of intemperance, pusillanimity, injustice, and either\nmalevolence or sordid selfishness, come to be disapproved of, not only\nunder their proper characters, but under the additional character of the\nmost short-sighted folly and weakness. Epicurus appears in every virtue\nto have attended to this species of propriety only. It is that which is\nmost apt to occur to those who are endeavouring to persuade others to\nregularity of conduct. When men by their practice, and perhaps too by\ntheir maxims, manifestly show that the natural beauty of virtue is not\nlike to have much effect upon them, how is it possible to move them but\nby representing the folly of their conduct, and how much they themselves\nare in the end likely to suffer by it?\nBy running up all the different virtues too to this one species of\npropriety, Epicurus indulged a propensity, which is natural to all men,\nbut which philosophers in particular are apt to cultivate with a\npeculiar fondness, as the great means of displaying their ingenuity, the\npropensity to account for all appearances from as few principles as\npossible. And he, no doubt, indulged this propensity still further, when\nhe referred all the primary objects of natural desire and aversion to\nthe pleasures and pains of the body. The great patron of the atomical\nphilosophy, who took so much pleasure in deducing all the powers and\nqualities of bodies from the most obvious and familiar, the figure,\nmotion, and arrangement of the small parts of matter, felt no doubt a\nsimilar satisfaction, when he accounted, in the same manner, for all the\nsentiments and passions of the mind from those which are most obvious\nand familiar.\nThe system of Epicurus agreed with those of Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno,\nin making virtue consist in acting in the most suitable manner to obtain\nthe [17]primary objects of natural desire. It differed from all of them\nin two other respects; first, in the account which it gave of those\nprimary objects of natural desire; and secondly, in the account which it\ngave of the excellence of virtue, or of the reason why that quality\nought to be esteemed.\nFootnote 17:\nPrima natur\u00e6.\nThe primary objects of natural desire consisted, according to Epicurus,\nin bodily pleasure and pain, and in nothing else whereas, according to\nthe other three philosophers, there were many other objects, such as\nknowledge, such as the happiness of our relations, of our friends, of\nour country, which were ultimately desirable for their own sakes.\nVirtue too, according to Epicurus, did not deserve to be pursued for its\nown sake, nor was itself one of the ultimate objects of natural\nappetite, but was eligible only upon account of its tendency to prevent\npain and to procure ease and pleasure. In the opinion of the other\nthree, on the contrary, it was desirable, not merely as the means of\nprocuring the other primary objects of natural desire, but as something\nwhich was in itself more valuable than them all. Man, they thought,\nbeing born for action, his happiness must consist, not merely in the\nagreeableness of his passive sensations, but also in the propriety of\nhis active exertions.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of those systems which make virtue consist in benevolence._\nThe system which makes virtue consist in benevolence, though I think not\nso ancient as all of those which I have already given an account of, is,\nhowever, of very great antiquity. It seems to have been the doctrine of\nthe greater part of those philosophers who, about and after the age of\nAugustus, called themselves Eclectics, who pretended to follow chiefly\nthe opinions of Plato and Pythagoras, and who upon that account are\ncommonly known by the name of the later Platonists.\nIn the divine nature, according to these authors, benevolence or love\nwas the sole principle of action, and directed the exertion of all the\nother attributes. The wisdom of the Deity was employed in finding out\nthe means for bringing about those ends which his goodness suggested, as\nhis infinite power was exerted to execute them. Benevolence, however,\nwas still the supreme and governing attribute, to which the others were\nsubservient, and from which the whole excellency, or the whole morality,\nif I may be allowed such an expression, of the divine operations, was\nultimately derived. The whole perfection and virtue of the human mind\nconsisted in some resemblance or participation of the divine\nperfections, and, consequently, in being filled with the same principle\nof benevolence and love which influenced all the actions of the deity.\nThe actions of men which flowed from this motive were alone truly\npraise-worthy, or could claim any merit in the sight of the deity. It\nwas by actions of charity and love only that we could imitate, as became\nus, the conduct of God, that we could express our humble and devout\nadmiration of his infinite perfections, that by fostering in our own\nminds the same divine principle, we could bring our own affections to a\ngreater resemblance with his holy attributes, and thereby become more\nproper objects of his love and esteem; till at last we arrived at that\nimmediate converse and communication with the deity to which it was the\ngreat object of this philosophy to raise us.\nThis system, as it was much esteemed by many ancient fathers of the\nchristian church, so after the reformation it was adopted by several\ndivines of the most eminent piety and learning, and of the most amiable\nmanners; particularly, by Dr. Ralph Cudworth, by Dr. Henry More, and by\nMr. John Smith of Cambridge. But of all the patrons of this system,\nancient or modern, the late Dr. Hutcheson, was undoubtedly beyond all\ncomparison, the most acute, the most distinct, the most philosophical,\nand what is of the greatest consequence of all, the soberest and most\njudicious.\nThat virtue consists in benevolence is a notion supported by many\nappearances in human nature. It has been observed already that proper\nbenevolence is the most graceful and agreeable of all the affections,\nthat it is recommended to us by a double sympathy, that as its tendency\nis necessarily beneficent, it is the proper object of gratitude and\nreward, and that upon all these accounts it appears to our natural\nsentiments to possess a merit superior to any other. It has been\nobserved too that even the weakness of benevolence are not very\ndisagreeable to us, whereas those of every other passion are always\nextremely disgusting. Who does not abhor excessive malice, excessive\nselfishness, or excessive resentment? But the most excessive indulgence\neven of partial friendship is not so offensive. It is the benevolent\npassions only which can exert themselves without any regard or attention\nto propriety, and yet retain something about them which is engaging.\nThere is something pleasing even in mere instinctive good-will which\ngoes on to do good offices without once reflecting whether by this\nconduct it is the proper object either of blame or approbation. It is\nnot so with the other passions. The moment they are deserted, the moment\nthey are unaccompanied by the sense of propriety, they cease to be\nagreeable.\nAs benevolence bestows upon those actions which proceed from it, a\nbeauty superior to all others, so the want of it, and much more the\ncontrary inclination, communicates a peculiar deformity to whatever\nevidences such a disposition. Pernicious actions are often punishable\nfor no other reason than because they show a want of sufficient\nattention to the happiness of our neighbour.\nBesides all this, Dr. Hutcheson[18] observed, that whenever in any\naction, supposed to proceed from benevolent affections, some other\nmotive had been discovered, our sense of the merit of this action was\njust so far diminished as this motive was believed to have influenced\nit. If an action, supposed to proceed, from gratitude, should be\ndiscovered to have arisen from an expectation of some new favour, or if\nwhat was apprehended to proceed from public spirit, should be found out\nto have taken its origin from the hope of a pecuniary reward, such a\ndiscovery would entirely destroy all notion of merit or\npraise-worthiness in either of these actions. Since, therefore, the\nmixture of any selfish motive, like that of a base alloy, diminished or\ntook away altogether the merit which would otherwise have belonged to\nany action, it was evident, he imagined, that virtue must consist in\npure and disinterested benevolence alone.\nFootnote 18:\nSee Inquiry concerning virtue, sect. 1. and 2.\nWhen those actions, on the contrary, which are commonly supposed to\nproceed from a selfish motive, are discovered to have arisen from a\nbenevolent one, it greatly enhances our sense of their merit. If we\nbelieved of any person that he endeavoured to advance his fortune from\nno other view but that of doing friendly offices, and of making proper\nreturns to his benefactors, we should only love and esteem him the more.\nAnd this observation seemed still more to confirm the conclusion, that\nit was benevolence only which could stamp upon any action the character\nof virtue.\nLast of all, what, he imagined, was an evident proof of the justness of\nthis account of virtue, in all the disputes of casuists concerning the\nrectitude of conduct, the public good, he observed, was the standard to\nwhich they constantly referred; thereby universally acknowledging that\nwhatever tended to promote the happiness of mankind was right and\nlaudable and virtuous, and the contrary, wrong, blameable, and vicious.\nIn the late debates about passive obedience and the right of resistance,\nthe sole point in controversy among men of sense was, whether universal\nsubmission would probably be attended with greater evils than temporary\ninsurrections when privileges were invaded. Whether what, upon the\nwhole, tended most to the happiness of mankind, was not also morally\ngood, was never once, he said, made a question.\nSince benevolence, therefore, was the only motive which could bestow\nupon any action the character of virtue, the greater the benevolence\nwhich was evidenced by any action, the greater the praise which must\nbelong to it.\nThose actions which aimed at the happiness of a great community, as they\ndemonstrated a more enlarged benevolence than those which aimed only at\nthat of a smaller system, so were they, likewise, proportionally the\nmore virtuous. The most virtuous of all affections, therefore, was that\nwhich embraced as its object the happiness of all intelligent beings.\nThe lead virtuous, on the contrary, of those to which the character of\nvirtue could in any respect belong, was that which aimed no further than\nat the happiness of an individual, such as a son, a brother, a friend.\nIn directing all our actions to promote the greatest possible good, in\nsubmitting all inferior affections to the desire of the general\nhappiness of mankind, in regarding ones self but as one of the many,\nwhose prosperity was to be pursued no further than it was consistent\nwith, or conducive to that of the whole, consisted the perfection of\nvirtue.\nSelf-love was a principle which could never be virtuous in any degree or\nin any direction. It was vicious whenever it obstructed the general\ngood. When it had no other effect than to make the individual take care\nof his own happiness, it was merely innocent, and tho\u2019 it deserved no\npraise, neither ought it to incur any blame. Those benevolent actions\nwhich were performed, notwithstanding some strong motive from\nself-interest, were the more virtuous upon that account. They\ndemonstrated the strength and vigour of the benevolent principle.\nDr. Hutcheson[19] was so far from allowing self-love to be in any case a\nmotive of virtuous actions, that even a regard to the pleasure of\nself-approbation, to the comfortable applause of our own consciences,\naccording to him, diminished the merit of a benevolent action. This was\na selfish motive, he thought, which, so far as it contributed to any\naction, demonstrated the weakness of that pure and disinterested\nbenevolence which could alone stamp upon the conduct of man the\ncharacter of virtue. In the common judgments of mankind, however, this\nregard to the approbation of our own minds is so far from being\nconsidered as what can in any respect diminish the virtue of any action,\nthat it is rather looked upon as the sole motive which deserves the\nappellation of virtuous.\nFootnote 19:\nInquiry concerning virtue, sect 2. art. 4. also illustrations on the\nmoral sense, sect. 5. last paragraph.\nSuch is the account given of the nature of virtue in this amiable\nsystem, a system which has a peculiar tendency to nourish and support in\nthe human heart the noblest and the most agreeable of all affections,\nand not only to check the injustice of self-love, but in some measure to\ndiscourage that principle altogether, by representing it as what could\nnever reflect any honour upon those who were influenced by it.\nAs some of the other systems which I have already given an account of,\ndo not sufficiently explain from whence arises the peculiar excellency\nof the supreme virtue of beneficence, so this system seems to have the\ncontrary defect, of not sufficiently explaining from whence arises our\napprobation of the inferior virtues of prudence, vigilance,\ncircumspection, temperance, constancy, firmness. The view and aim of our\naffections, the beneficent and hurtful effects which they tend to\nproduce, are the only qualities at all attended to in this system. Their\npropriety and impropriety, their suitableness and unsuitableness, to the\ncause which excites them, are disregarded altogether.\nRegard to our own private happiness and interest too, appear upon many\noccasions very laudable principles of action. The habits of \u0153conomy,\nindustry, discretion, attention, and application of thought, are\ngenerally supposed to be cultivated from self-interested motives, and at\nthe same time are apprehended to be very praise-worthy qualities, which\ndeserve the esteem and approbation of every body. The mixture of a\nselfish motive, it is true, seems often to sully the beauty of those\nactions which ought to arise from a benevolent affection. The cause of\nthis, however, is not that self-love can never be the motive of a\nvirtuous action, but that the benevolent principle appears in this\nparticular case to want its due degree of strength, and to be altogether\nunsuitable to its object. The character, therefore, seems evidently\nimperfect, and upon the whole to deserve blame rather than praise. The\nmixture of a benevolent motive in an action to which self-love alone\nought to be sufficient to prompt us, is not so apt indeed to diminish\nour sense of its propriety, or of the virtue of the person who performs\nit. We are not ready to suspect any person of being defective in\nselfishness. This is by no means the weak side of human nature, or the\nfailing of which we are apt to be suspicious. If we could really\nbelieve, however, of any man, that, was it not from a regard to his\nfamily and friends, he would not take that proper care of his health,\nhis life, or his fortune, to which self-preservation alone ought to be\nsufficient to prompt him, it would undoubtedly be a failing, tho\u2019 one of\nthose amiable failings, which render a person rather the object of pity\nthan of contempt or hatred. It would still, however, somewhat diminish\nthe dignity and respectableness of his character. Carelessness and want\nof \u0153conomy are universally disapproved of, not, however as proceeding\nfrom a want of benevolence, but from a want of the proper attention to\nthe objects of self-interest.\nThough the standard by which casuists frequently determine what is right\nor wrong in human conduct, be its tendency to the welfare or disorder of\nsociety, it does not follow that a regard to the welfare of society\nshould be the sole virtuous motive of action, but only that, in any\ncompetition, it ought to cast the balance against all other motives.\nBenevolence may, perhaps, be the sole principle of action in the Deity,\nand there are several, not improbable, arguments which tend to persuade\nus that it is so. It is not easy to conceive what other motive an\nindependent and all perfect being, who stands in need of nothing\nexternal, and whose happiness is complete in himself, can act from. But\nwhatever may be the case with the Deity, so imperfect a creature as man,\nthe support of whose existence requires so many things external to him,\nmust often act from many other motives. The condition of human nature\nwere peculiarly hard, if those affections, which, by the very nature of\nour being, ought frequently to influence our conduct, could upon no\noccasion appear virtuous, or deserve esteem and commendation from any\nbody.\nThose three systems, that which places virtue in propriety, that which\nplaces it in prudence, and that which makes it consist in benevolence,\nare the principal accounts which have been given of the nature of\nvirtue. To one or other of them, all the other descriptions of virtue,\nhow different soever they may appear, are easily reducible.\nThat system which places virtue in obedience to the will of the Deity,\nmay be counted either among those which make it consist in prudence, or\namong those which make it consist in propriety. When it is asked, why we\nought to obey the will of the Deity, this question, which would be\nimpious and absurd in the highest degree, if asked from any doubt that\nwe ought to obey him, can admit but of two different answers. It must\neither be said that we ought to obey the will of the Deity because he is\na being of infinite power, who will reward us eternally if we do so, and\npunish us eternally if we do otherwise: Or it must be said, that\nindependent of any regard to our own happiness, or to rewards and\npunishments of any kind, there is a congruity and fitness that a\ncreature should obey its creator, that a limited and imperfect being\nshould submit to one of infinite and incomprehensible perfections.\nBesides one or other of these two it is impossible to conceive that any\nother answer can be given to this question. If the first answer be the\nproper one, virtue consists in prudence, or in the proper pursuit of our\nown final interest and happiness; since it is upon this account that we\nare obliged to obey the will of the Deity. If the second answer be the\nproper one, virtue must consist in propriety, since the ground of our\nobligation to obedience is the suitableness or congruity of the\nsentiments of humility and submission to the superiority of the object\nwhich excites them.\nThat system which places virtue in utility coincides too with that which\nmakes it consist in propriety. According to this system all those\nqualities of the mind which are agreeable or advantageous, either to the\nperson himself or to others, are approved of as virtuous, and the\ncontrary disapproved of as vicious. But the agreeableness or utility of\nany affection depends upon the degree which it is allowed to subsist in.\nEvery affection is useful when it is confined to a certain degree of\nmoderation, and every affection is disadvantageous when it exceeds the\nproper bounds. According to this system therefore, virtue consists, not\nin any one affection, but in the proper degree of all the affections,\nThe only difference between it and that which I have been endeavouring\nto establish, is, that it makes utility, and not sympathy, or the\ncorrespondent affection of the spectator, the natural and original\nmeasure of this proper degree.\nCHAP. IV.\n_Of licentious systems._\nAll those systems, which I have hitherto given an account of, suppose\nthat there is a real and essential distinction between vice and virtue,\nwhatever these qualities may consist in. There is a real and essential\ndifference between the propriety and impropriety of any affection,\nbetween benevolence and any other principle of action, between real\nprudence and short-sighted folly or precipitate rashness. In the main\ntoo all of them contribute to encourage the praise-worthy, and to\ndiscourage the blameable disposition.\nIt may be true perhaps, of some of them, that they tend, in some\nmeasure, to break the balance of the affections, and to give the mind a\nparticular bias to some principles of action, beyond the proportion that\nis due to them. The ancient systems which place virtue in propriety,\nseem chiefly to recommend the great, the awful, and the respectable\nvirtues, the virtues of self-government and self-command; fortitude,\nmagnanimity, independency upon fortune, the contempt of all outward\naccidents, of pain, poverty, exile, and death. It is in these great\nexertions that the noblest propriety of conduct is displayed. The soft,\nthe amiable, the gentle virtues, all the virtues of indulgent humanity\nare, in comparison, but little insisted upon, and seem, on the contrary,\nby the Stoics in particular, to have been often regarded as mere\nweaknesses which it behoved a wise man not to harbour in his breast.\nThe benevolent system, on the other hand, while it fosters and\nencourages all those milder virtues in the highest degree, seems\nentirely to neglect the more awful and respectable qualities of the\nmind. It even denies them the appellation of virtues. It calls them\nmoral abilities, and treats them as qualities which do not deserve the\nsame sort of esteem and approbation, that is due to what is properly\ndenominated virtue. All those principles of action which aim only at our\nown interest, it treats, if that be possible, still worse. So far from\nhaving any merit of their own, they diminish, it pretends, the merit of\nbenevolence, when they co-operate with it: and prudence, it is asserted,\nwhen employed only in promoting private interest, can never even be\nimagined a virtue.\nThat system, again, which makes virtue consist in prudence only, while\nit gives the highest encouragement to the habits of caution, vigilance,\nsobriety, and judicious moderation, seems to degrade equally both the\namiable and respectable virtues, and to strip the former of all their\nbeauty, and the latter of all their grandeur.\nBut notwithstanding these defects, the general tendency of each of those\nthree systems is to encourage the best and most laudable habits of the\nhuman mind: and it were well for society, if, either mankind in general,\nor even those few who pretend to live according to any philosophical\nrule, were to regulate their conduct by the precepts of any one of them.\nWe may learn from each of them something that is both valuable and\npeculiar. If it was possible, by precept and exhortation, to inspire the\nmind with fortitude and magnanimity, the ancient systems of propriety\nwould seem sufficient to do this. Or if it was possible, by the same\nmeans, to soften it into humanity, and to awaken the affections of\nkindness and general love towards those we live with, some of the\npictures with which the benevolent system presents us, might seem\ncapable of producing this effect. We may learn from the system of\nEpicurus, though undoubtedly the worst of all the three, how much the\npractice of both the amiable and respectable virtues is conducive to our\nown interest, to our own ease and safety and quiet even in this life. As\nEpicurus placed happiness in the attainment of ease and security, he\nexerted himself in a particular manner to show that virtue was, not\nmerely the best and the surest, but the only means of acquiring those\ninvaluable possessions. The good effects of virtue, upon our inward\ntranquility and peace of mind, are what other philosophers have chiefly\ncelebrated. Epicurus, without neglecting this topic, has chiefly\ninsisted upon the influence of that amiable quality on our outward\nprosperity and safety. It was upon this account that his writings were\nso much studied in the ancient world by men of all different\nphilosophical parties. It is from him that Cicero, the great enemy of\nthe Epicurean system, borrows his most agreeable proofs that virtue\nalone is sufficient to secure happiness. Seneca, though a Stoic, the\nsect most opposite to that of Epicurus, yet quotes this philosopher more\nfrequently than any other.\nThere are, however, some other systems which seem to take away\naltogether the distinction between vice and virtue, and of which the\ntendency is, upon that account, wholly pernicious: I mean the systems of\nthe duke of Rochefoucault and Dr. Mandeville. Though the notions of both\nthese authors are in almost every respect erroneous, there are, however,\nsome appearances in human nature which, when viewed in a certain manner,\nseem at first sight to favour them. These, first slightly sketched out\nwith the elegance and delicate precision of the duke of Rochefoucault,\nand afterwards more fully represented with the lively and humorous,\nthough coarse and rustic eloquence of Dr. Mandeville, have thrown upon\ntheir doctrines an air of truth and probability which is very apt to\nimpose upon the unskilful.\nDr. Mandeville, the most methodical of those two authors, considers\nwhatever is done from a sense of propriety, from a regard to what is\ncommendable and praise-worthy, as being done from a love of praise and\ncommendation, or as he calls it from vanity. Man, he observes, is\nnaturally much more interested in his own happiness than in that of\nothers, and it is impossible that in his heart he can ever really prefer\ntheir prosperity to his own. Whenever he appears to do so, we may be\nassured that he imposes upon us, and that he is then acting from the\nsame selfish motives as at all other times. Among his other selfish\npassions, vanity is one of the strongest, and he is always easily\nflattered and greatly delighted with the applauses of those about him.\nWhen he appears to sacrifice his own interest to that of his companions,\nhe knows that this conduct will be highly agreeable to their self-love,\nand that they will not fail to express their satisfaction by bellowing\nupon him the most extravagant praises. The pleasure which he expects\nfrom this, over-balances, in his opinion, the interest which he abandons\nin order to procure it. His conduct, therefore, upon this occasion, is\nin reality just as selfish, and arises from just as mean a motive as\nupon any other. He is flattered, however, and he flatters himself with\nthe belief that it is entirely disinterested; since, unless this was\nsupposed, it would not seem to merit any commendation either in his own\neyes or in those of others. All public spirit, therefore, all preference\nof public to private interest, is, according to him a mere cheat and\nimposition upon mankind; and that human virtue which is so much boasted\nof, and which is the occasion of so much emulation among men, is the\nmere offspring of flattery begot upon pride.\nWhether the most generous and public-spirited actions may not, in some\nsense, be regarded as proceeding from self-love, I shall not at present\nexamine. The decision of this question is not, I apprehend, of any\nimportance towards establishing the reality of virtue, since self-love\nmay frequently be a virtuous motive of action. I shall only endeavour to\nshow that the desire of doing what is honourable and noble, of rendering\nourselves the proper objects of esteem and approbation, cannot with any\npropriety be called vanity. Even the love of well-grounded fame and\nreputation, the desire of acquiring esteem by what is really estimable,\ndoes not deserve that name. The first is the love of virtue, the noblest\nand the best passion of human nature. The second is the love of true\nglory, a passion inferior no doubt to the former, but which in dignity\nappears to come immediately after it. He is guilty of vanity who desires\npraise for qualities which are either not praise-worthy in any degree,\nor not in that degree which he expects to be praised for them; who sets\nhis character upon the frivolous ornaments of dress and equipage, or the\nequally frivolous accomplishments of ordinary behaviour. He is guilty of\nvanity who desires praise for what indeed very well deserves it, but\nwhat he perfectly knows does not belong to him. The empty coxcomb who\ngives himself airs of importance which he has no title to, the silly\nliar who assumes the merit of adventures which never happened, the\nfoolish plagiary who gives himself out for the author of what he has no\npretensions to, are properly accused of this passion. He too is said to\nbe guilty of vanity who is not contented with the silent sentiments of\nesteem and approbation, who seems to be fonder of their noisy\nexpressions and acclamations than of the sentiments themselves, who is\nnever satisfied but when his own praises are ringing in his ears, and\nwho solicits with the most anxious importunity all external marks of\nrespect, is fond of titles, of compliments, of being visited, of being\nattended, of being taken notice of in public places with the appearance\nof deference and attention. This frivolous passion is altogether\ndifferent from either of the two former, and is the passion of the\nlowest, and the least of mankind, as they are of the noblest and the\ngreatest.\nBut though these three passions, the desire of rendering ourselves the\nproper objects of honour and esteem; or of becoming what is honourable\nand estimable; the desire of acquiring honour and esteem by really\ndeserving those sentiments; and the frivolous desire of praise at any\nrate, are widely different; though the two former are always approved\nof, while the latter never fails to be despised; there is, however, a\ncertain remote affinity among them, which, exaggerated by the humorous\nand diverting eloquence of this lively author, has enabled him to impose\nupon his readers. There is an affinity between vanity and the love of\ntrue glory, as both these passions aim at acquiring esteem and\napprobation. But they are different in this, that the one is a just,\nreasonable, and equitable passion, while the other is unjust, absurd,\nand ridiculous. The man who desires esteem for what is really estimable,\ndesires nothing but what he is justly entitled to, and what cannot be\nrefused him without some sort of injury. He, on the contrary, who\ndesires it upon any other terms, demands what he has no just claim to.\nThe first is easily satisfied, is not apt to be jealous or suspicious\nthat we do not esteem him enough, and is seldom solicitous about\nreceiving many external marks of our regard. The other, on the contrary,\nis never to be satisfied, is full of jealousy and suspicion that we do\nnot esteem him so much as he desires, because he has some secret\nconsciousness that he desires more than he deserves. The least neglect\nof ceremony, he considers as a mortal affront, and as an expression of\nthe most determined contempt. He is restless and impatient, and\nperpetually afraid that we have lost all respect for him, and is upon\nthis account always anxious to obtain new expressions of esteem, and\ncannot be kept in temper but by continual attendance and adulation.\nThere is an affinity too between the desire of becoming what is\nhonourable and estimable, and the desire of honour and esteem, between\nthe love of virtue and the love of true glory. They resemble one another\nnot only in this respect, that both aim at really being what is\nhonourable and noble, but even in that respect in which the love of true\nglory resembles what is properly called vanity, some reference to the\nsentiments of others. The man of the greatest magnanimity, who desires\nvirtue for its own sake, and is most indifferent about what actually are\nthe opinions of mankind with regard to him, is still, however, delighted\nwith the thoughts of what they should be, with the consciousness that\nthough he may neither be honoured nor applauded, he is still the proper\nobject of honour and applause, and that if mankind were cool and candid\nand consistent with themselves, and properly informed of the motives and\ncircumstances of his conduct, they would not fail to honour and applaud\nhim. Though he despises the opinions which are actually entertained of\nhim, he has the highest value for those which ought to be entertained of\nhim. That he might think himself worthy of those honourable sentiments,\nand, whatever was the idea which other men might conceive of his\ncharacter, that when he should put himself in their situation, and\nconsider, not what was, but what ought to be their opinion, he should\nalways have the highest idea of it himself, was the great and exalted\nmotive of his conduct. As even in the love of virtue, therefore, there\nis still some reference, though not to what is, yet to what in reason\nand propriety ought to be, the opinion of others, there is even in this\nrespect some affinity between it, and the love of true glory. There is,\nhowever, at the same time, a very great difference between them. The man\nwho acts solely from a regard to what is right and fit to be done, from\na regard to what is the proper object of esteem and approbation, though\nthese sentiments should never be bestowed upon him, acts from the most\nsublime and godlike motive which human nature is even capable of\nconceiving. The man, on the other hand, who while he desires to merit\napprobation is at the same time anxious to obtain it, though he too is\nlaudably in the main, yet his motives have a greater mixture of human\ninfirmity. He is in danger of being mortified by the ignorance and\ninjustice of mankind, and his happiness is exposed to the envy of his\nrivals, and the folly of the public. The happiness of the other, on the\ncontrary, is altogether secure and independent of fortune, and of the\ncaprice of those he lives with. The contempt and hatred which may be\nthrown upon him by the ignorance of mankind, he considers as not\nbelonging to him, and is not at all mortified by it. Mankind despise and\nhate him from a false notion of his character and conduct. If they knew\nhim better, they would esteem and love him. It is not him whom, properly\nspeaking, they hate and despise, but another person whom they mistake\nhim to be. Our friend, whom we should meet at a masquerade in the garb\nof our enemy, would be more diverted than mortified, if under that\ndisguise we should vent our indignation against him. Such are the\nsentiments of a man of real magnanimity, when exposed to unjust censure.\nIt seldom happens, however, that human nature arrives at this degree of\nfirmness. Though none but the weakest and most worthless of mankind are\nmuch delighted with false glory, yet, by a strange inconsistency, false\nignominy is often capable of mortifying those who appear the most\nresolute and determined.\nDr. Mandeville is not satisfied with representing the frivolous motive\nof vanity, as the source of all those actions which are commonly\naccounted virtuous. He endeavours to point out the imperfection of human\nvirtue in many other respects. In every case, he pretends, it falls\nshort of that complete self-denial which it pretends to, and, instead of\na conquest, is commonly no more than a concealed indulgence of our\npassions. Wherever our reserve with regard to pleasure falls short of\nthe most ascetic abstinence, he treats it as gross luxury and\nsensuality. Every thing, according to him, is luxury which exceeds what\nis absolutely necessary for the support of human nature, so that there\nis a vice even in the use of a clean shirt, or of a convenient\nhabitation. The indulgence of the inclination to sex, in the most lawful\nunion, he considers as the same sensuality with the most hurtful\ngratification of that passion, and derides that temperance and that\nchastity which can be practiced at so cheap a rate. The ingenious\nsophistry of his reasoning, is here, as upon many other occasions,\ncovered by the ambiguity of language. There are some of our passions\nwhich have no other names except those which mark the disagreeable and\noffensive degree. The spectator is more apt to take notice of them in\nthis degree than in any other. When they shock his own sentiments, when\nthey give him some sort of antipathy and uneasiness, he is necessarily\nobliged to attend to them, and is from thence naturally led to give them\na name. When they fall in with the natural state of his own mind, he is\nvery apt to overlook them altogether, and either gives them no name at\nall, or, if he gives them any, it is one which marks rather the\nsubjection and restraint of the passion than the degree which it still\nis allowed to subsist in, after it is so subjected and restrained. Thus\nthe common names of the [20]love of pleasure, and of the love of sex,\ndenote a vicious and offensive degree of those passions. The words\ntemperance and chastity, on the other hand, seem to mark rather the\nrestraint and subjection which they are kept under, than the degree\nwhich they are still allowed to subsist in. When he can show, therefore,\nthat they still subsist in some degree, he imagines, he has entirely\ndemolished the reality of the virtues of temperance and chastity, and\nshown them to be mere impositions upon the inattention and simplicity of\nmankind. Those virtues, however, do not require an entire insensibility\nto the objects of the passions which they mean to govern. They only aim\nat restraining the violence of those passions so far as not to hurt the\nindividual, and neither disturb nor offend the society.\nFootnote 20:\nLuxury and lust.\nIt is the great fallacy of Dr. Mandeville\u2019s book[21] to represent every\npassion as wholly vicious, which is so in any degree and in any\ndirection. It is thus that he treats every thing as vanity which has any\nreference, either to what are, or to what ought to be the sentiments of\nothers: and it is by means of this sophistry, that he establishes his\nfavourite conclusion, that private vices are public benefits. If the\nlove of magnificence, a taste for the elegant arts and improvements of\nhuman life, for whatever is agreeable in dress, furniture, or equipage,\nfor architecture, statuary, painting, and music, is to be regarded as\nluxury, sensuality and ostentation, even in those whose situation\nallows, without any inconveniency, the indulgence of those passions, it\nis certain that luxury, sensuality, and ostentation are public benefits:\nsince, without the qualities upon which he thinks proper to bestow such\nopprobrious names, the arts of refinement could never find\nencouragement, and must languish for want of employment. Some popular\nascetic doctrines which had been current before his time, and which\nplaced virtue in the entire extirpation and annihilation of all our\npassions, were the real foundation of this licentious system. It was\neasy for Dr. Mandeville to prove, first, that this entire conquest never\nactually took place among men; and secondly, that, if it was to take\nplace universally, it would be pernicious to society, by putting an end\nto all industry and commerce, and in a manner to the whole business of\nhuman life. By the first of these propositions he seemed to prove that\nthere was no real virtue, and that what pretended to be such, was a mere\ncheat and imposition upon mankind; and by the second, that private vices\nwere public benefits, since without them no society could prosper or\nflourish.\nFootnote 21:\nFable of the Bees.\nSuch is the system of Dr. Mandeville, which once made so much noise in\nthe world, and which, though perhaps, it never gave occasion to more\nvice than what would have been without it, at least taught that vice,\nwhich arose from other causes, to appear with more effrontery, and to\navow the corruption of its motives with a profligate audaciousness which\nhad never been heard of before.\nBut how destructive soever this system may appear, it could never have\nimposed upon so great a number of persons, nor have occasioned so\ngeneral an alarm among those who are the friends of better principles,\nhad it not in some respects bordered upon the truth. A system of natural\nphilosophy may appear very plausible, and be for a long time very\ngenerally received in the world, and yet have no foundation in nature,\nnor any sort of resemblance to the truth. The vortices of Des Cartes\nwere regarded by a very ingenious nation, for near a century together,\nas a most satisfactory account of the revolutions of the heavenly\nbodies. Yet it has been demonstrated, to the conviction of all mankind,\nthat these pretended causes of those wonderful effects, not only do not\nactually exist, but are utterly impossible, and if they did exist, could\nproduce no such effects as are ascribed to them. But it is otherwise\nwith systems of moral philosophy, and an author who pretends to account\nfor the origin of our moral sentiments, cannot deceive us so grossly,\nnor depart so very far from all resemblance to the truth. When a\ntraveller gives an account of some distant country, he may impose upon\nour credulity the most groundless and absurd fictions as the most\ncertain matters of fact. But when a person pretends to inform us of what\npasses in our neighbourhood, and of the affairs of the very parish which\nwe live in, though here too, if we are so careless as not to examine\nthings with our own eyes, he may deceive us in many respects, yet the\ngreatest falsehoods which he imposes upon us must bear some resemblance\nto the truth, and must even have a considerable mixture of truth in\nthem. An author who treats of natural philosophy, and pretends to assign\nthe causes of the great phenomena of the universe, pretends to give an\naccount of the affairs of a very distant country, concerning which he\nmay tell us what he pleases, and as long as his narration keeps within\nthe bounds of seeming possibility, he need not despair of gaining our\nbelief. But when he proposes to explain the origin of our desires and\naffections, of our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation, he\npretends to give an account, not only of the affairs of the very parish\nthat we live in, but of our own domestic concerns. Though here too, like\nindolent masters who put their trust in a steward who deceives them, we\nare very liable to be imposed upon, yet we are incapable of passing any\naccount which does not preserve some little regard to the truth. Some of\nthe articles, at least, must be just, and even those which are most\novercharged must have had some foundation, otherwise the fraud would be\ndetected even by that careless inspection which we are disposed to give.\nThe author who should assign, as the cause of any natural sentiment,\nsome principle which neither had any connexion with it, nor resembled\nany other principle which had some such connexion, would appear absurd\nand ridiculous to the most injudicious and unexperienced reader.\nSECTION III.\nOf the different systems which have been formed concerning the principle\nof approbation.\nINTRODUCTION.\nAfter the inquiry concerning the nature of virtue, the next question of\nimportance in Moral Philosophy, is concerning the principle of\napprobation, concerning the power or faculty of the mind which renders\ncertain characters agreeable or disagreeable to us, makes us prefer one\ntenour of conduct to another, denominate the one right and the other\nwrong, and consider the one as the object of approbation, honour, and\nreward; the other as that of blame, censure, and punishment.\nThree different accounts have been given of this principle of\napprobation. According to some, we approve and disapprove both of our\nown actions and of those of others, from self-love only, or from some\nview of their tendency to our own happiness or disadvantage; according\nto others, reason, the same faculty by which we distinguish between\ntruth and falsehood, enables us to distinguish between what is fit and\nunfit both in actions and affections: according to others this\ndistinction is altogether the effect of immediate sentiment and feeling,\nand arises from the satisfaction or disgust with which the view of\ncertain actions or affections inspires us. Self-love, reason, and\nsentiment, therefore, are the three different sources which have been\nassigned for the principle of approbation.\nBefore I proceed to give an account of those different systems, I must\nobserve, that the determination of this second question, though of the\ngreatest importance in speculation, is of none in practice. The question\nconcerning the nature of virtue necessarily has some influence upon our\nnotions of right and wrong in many particular cases. That concerning the\nprinciple of approbation can possibly have no such effect. To examine\nfrom what contrivance or mechanism within, those different notions or\nsentiments arise, is a mere matter of philosophical curiosity.\nCHAP. I.\n_Of those systems which deduce the principle of approbation from\nself-love._\nThose who account for the principle of approbation from self-love, do\nnot all account for it in the same manner, and there is a good deal of\nconfusion and inaccuracy in all their different systems. According to\nMr. Hobbes, and many of his followers,[22] man is driven to take refuge\nin society, not by any natural love which he bears to his own kind, but\nbecause without the assistance of others he is incapable of subsisting\nwith ease or safety. Society, upon this account, becomes necessary to\nhim, and whatever tends to its support and welfare, he considers as\nhaving a remote tendency to his own interest, and, on the contrary,\nwhatever is likely to disturb or destroy it, he regards as in some\nmeasure hurtful or pernicious to himself. Virtue is the great support,\nand vice the great disturber of human society. The former, therefore, is\nagreeable, and the latter offensive to every man; as from the one he\nforesees the prosperity, and from the other the ruin and disorder of\nwhat is so necessary for the comfort and security of his existence.\nFootnote 22:\nPuffendorff. Mandeville.\nThat the tendency of virtue to promote, and of vice to disturb the order\nof society, when we consider it coolly and philosophically, reflects a\nvery great beauty upon the one, and a very great deformity upon the\nother, cannot, as I have observed upon a former occasion, be called in\nquestion. Human society, when we contemplate it in a certain abstract\nand philosophical light, appears like a great, an immense machine, whose\nregular and harmonious movements produce a thousand agreeable effects.\nAs in any other beautiful and noble machine that was the production of\nhuman art, whatever tended to render its movements more smooth and easy,\nwould derive a beauty from this effect, and, on the contrary, whatever\ntended to obstruct them would displease upon that account: so virtue,\nwhich is, as it were, the fine polish to the wheels of society,\nnecessarily pleases; while vice, like the vile rust, which makes them\njar and grate upon one another, is as necessarily offensive. This\naccount, therefore, of the origin of approbation and disapprobation, so\nfar as it derives them from a regard to the order of society, runs into\nthat principle which gives beauty to utility, and which I have explained\nupon a former occasion; and it is from thence that this system derives\nall that appearance of probability which it possesses. When those\nauthors describe the innumerable advantages of a cultivated and social,\nabove a savage and solitary life; when they expatiate upon the necessity\nof virtue and good order for the maintenance of the one, and demonstrate\nhow infallibly the prevalence of vice and disobedience to the laws tend\nto bring back the other, the reader is charmed with the novelty and\ngrandeur of those views which they open to him: he sees plainly a new\nbeauty in virtue, and a new deformity in vice, which he had never taken\nnotice of before, and is commonly so delighted with the discovery, that\nhe seldom takes time to reflect, that this political view, having never\noccurred to him in his life before, cannot possibly be the ground of\nthat approbation and disapprobation with which he has always been\naccustomed to consider those different qualities.\nWhen those authors, on the other hand, deduce from self-love the\ninterest which we take in the welfare of society, and the esteem which\nupon that account we bestow upon virtue, they do not mean, that when we\nin this age applaud the virtue of Cato, and detest the villainy of\nCatiline, our sentiments are influenced by the notion of any benefit we\nreceive from the one, or of any detriment we suffer from the other. It\nwas not because the prosperity or subversion of society, in those remote\nages and nations, was apprehended to have any influence upon our\nhappiness or misery in the present times; that according to those\nphilosophers, we esteemed the virtuous, and blamed the disorderly\ncharacter. They never imagined that our sentiments were influenced by\nany benefit or damage which we supposed actually to redound to us, from\neither; but by that which might have redounded to us, had we lived in\nthose distant ages and countries; or by that which might still redound\nto us, if in our own times we should meet with characters of the same\nkind. The idea, in short, which those authors were groping about, but\nwhich they were never able to unfold distinctly, was that indirect\nsympathy which we feel with the gratitude or resentment of those who\nreceived the benefit or suffered the damage resulting from such opposite\ncharacters: and it was this which they were indistinctly pointing at,\nwhen they said, that it was not the thought of what we had gained or\nsuffered which prompted our applause or indignation, but the conception\nor imagination of what we might gain or suffer if we were to act in\nsociety with such associates.\nSympathy, however, cannot, in any sense, be regarded as a selfish\nprinciple. When I sympathize with your sorrow or your indignation, it\nmay be pretended, indeed, that my emotion is founded in self-love,\nbecause it arises from bringing your case home to myself, from putting\nmyself in your situation, and thence conceiving what I should feel in\nthe like circumstances. But though sympathy is very properly said to\narise from an imaginary change of situations with the person principally\nconcerned, yet this imaginary change is not supposed to happen to me in\nmy own person and character, but in that of the person with whom I\nsympathize. When I condole with you for the loss of your only son, in\norder to enter into your grief, I do not consider what I, a person of\nsuch a character and profession, should suffer, if I had a son, and if\nthat son was unfortunately to die: but I consider what I should suffer\nif I was really you, and I not only change circumstances with you, but I\nchange persons and characters. My grief, therefore, is entirely upon\nyour account, and not in the least upon my own. It is not, therefore, in\nthe least selfish. How can that be regarded as a selfish passion, which\ndoes not arise even from the imagination of any thing that has befallen,\nor that relates to myself, in my own proper person and character, but\nwhich is entirely occupied about what relates to you? A man may\nsympathize with a woman in child-bed; though it is impossible that he\nshould conceive himself as suffering her pains in his own proper person\nand character. That whole account of human nature, however, which\ndeduces all sentiments and affections from self-love, which has made so\nmuch noise in the world, but which, so far as I know, has never yet been\nfully and distinctly explained, seems to me to have arisen from some\nconfused misapprehension of the system of sympathy.\nCHAP. II.\n_Of those systems which make reason the principle of approbation._\nIt is well known to have been the doctrine of Mr. Hobbes, that a state\nof nature, is a state of war; and that antecedent to the institution of\ncivil government, there could be no safe or peaceable society among men.\nTo preserve society, therefore, according to him, was to support civil\ngovernment, and to destroy civil government was the same thing as to put\nan end to society. But the existence of civil government depends upon\nthe obedience that is paid to the supreme magistrate. The moment he\nloses his authority, all government is at an end. As self-preservation,\ntherefore, teaches men to applaud whatever tends to promote the welfare\nof society, and to blame whatever is likely to hurt it; so the same\nprinciple, if they would think and speak consistently, ought to teach\nthem to applaud upon all occasions obedience to the civil magistrate,\nand to blame all disobedience and rebellion. The very ideas of laudable\nand blameable, ought to be the same with those of obedience and\ndisobedience. The laws of the civil magistrate, therefore, ought to be\nregarded as the sole ultimate standards of what was just and unjust, of\nwhat was right and wrong.\nIt was the avowed intention of Mr. Hobbes, by propagating these notions,\nto subject the consciences of men immediately to the civil, and not to\nthe ecclesiastical powers, whose turbulence and ambition, he had been\ntaught, by the example of his own times, to regard as the principal\nsource of the disorders of society. His doctrine, upon this account, was\npeculiarly offensive to Theologians, who accordingly did not fail to\nvent their indignation against him with great asperity and bitterness.\nIt was likewise offensive to all sound moralists, as it supposed that\nthere was no natural distinction between right and wrong, that these\nwere mutable and changeable, and depended upon the mere arbitrary will\nof the civil magistrate. This account of things, therefore, was attacked\nfrom all quarters, and by all sorts of weapons, by sober reason as well\nas by furious declamation.\nIn order to confute so odious a doctrine, it was necessary to prove,\nthat antecedent to all law or positive institution, the mind was\nnaturally endowed with a faculty, by which it distinguished in certain\nactions and affections, the qualities of right, laudable, and virtuous,\nand in others those of wrong, blameable, and vicious.\nLaw, it was justly observed by Dr. Cudworth,[23] could not be the\noriginal source of those distinctions; since upon the supposition of\nsuch a law, it must either be right to obey it, and wrong to disobey it,\nor indifferent whether we obeyed it, or disobeyed it. That law which it\nwas indifferent whether we obeyed or disobeyed, could not, it was\nevident, be the source of those distinctions; neither could that which\nit was right to obey and wrong to disobey, since even this still\nsupposed the antecedent notions or ideas of right and wrong, and that\nobedience to the law was conformable to the idea of right, and\ndisobedience to that of wrong.\nFootnote 23:\nImmutable Morality, l. 1.\nSince the mind, therefore, had a notion of those distinctions antecedent\nto all law, it seemed necessarily to follow, that it derived this notion\nfrom reason, which pointed out the difference between right and wrong,\nin the same manner in which it did that between truth and falsehood: and\nthis conclusion, which though true in some respects, is rather hasty in\nothers, was more easily received at a time when the abstract science of\nhuman nature was but in its infancy, and before the distinct offices and\npowers of the different faculties of the human mind had been carefully\nexamined and distinguished from one another. When this controversy with\nMr. Hobbes was carried on with the greatest warmth and keenness, no\nother faculty had been thought of from which any such ideas could\npossibly be supposed to arise. It became at this time, therefore, the\npopular doctrine, that the essence of virtue and vice did not consist in\nthe conformity or disagreement of human actions with the law of a\nsuperior, but in their conformity or disagreement with reason, which was\nthus considered as the original source and principle of approbation and\ndisapprobation.\nThat virtue consists in conformity to reason, is true in some respects,\nand this faculty may very justly be considered, as in some sense, the\nsource and principle of approbation and disapprobation, and of all solid\njudgments concerning right and wrong. It is by reason that we discover\nthose general rules of justice by which we ought to regulate our\nactions: and it is by the same faculty that we form those more vague and\nindeterminate ideas of what is prudent, of what is decent, of what is\ngenerous or noble, which we carry constantly about with us, and\naccording to which we endeavour, as well as we can, to model the tenour\nof our conduct. The general maxims of morality are formed, like all\nother general maxims, from experience and induction. We observe in a\ngreat variety of particular cases what pleases or displeases our moral\nfaculties, what these approve or disapprove of, and, by induction from\nthis experience, we establish those general rules. But induction is\nalways regarded as one of the operations of reason. From reason,\ntherefore, we are very properly said to derive all those general maxims\nand ideas. It is by these, however, that we regulate the greater part of\nour moral judgments, which would be extremely uncertain and precarious\nif they depended altogether upon what is liable to so many variations as\nimmediate sentiment and feeling, which the different states of health\nand humour are capable of altering so essentially. As our most solid\njudgments, therefore, with regard to right and wrong, are regulated by\nmaxims and ideas derived from an induction of reason, virtue may very\nproperly be said to consist in a conformity to reason, and so far this\nfaculty may be considered as the source and principle of approbation and\ndisapprobation.\nBut though reason is undoubtedly the source of the general rules of\nmorality, and of all the moral judgments which we form by means of them;\nit is altogether absurd and unintelligible to suppose that the first\nperceptions of right and wrong can be derived from reason, even in those\nparticular cases upon the experience of which the general rules are\nformed. These first perceptions, as well all other experiments upon\nwhich any general rules are founded, cannot be the object of reason, but\nof immediate sense and feeling. It is by finding in a vast variety of\ninstances that one tenour of conduct constantly pleases in a certain\nmanner, and that another as constantly displeases the mind, that we form\nthe general rules of morality. But reason cannot render any particular\nobject either agreeable or disagreeable to the mind for its own sake.\nReason may show that this object is the means of obtaining some other\nwhich is naturally either pleasing or displeasing, and in this manner\nmay render it either agreeable or disagreeable for the sake of something\nelse. But nothing can be agreeable or disagreeable for its own sake,\nwhich is not rendered such by immediate sense and feeling. If virtue,\ntherefore, in every particular instance, necessarily pleases for its own\nsake, and if vice as certainly displeases the mind, it cannot be reason,\nbut immediate sense and feeling, which, in this manner, reconciles us to\nthe one, and alienates us from the other.\nPleasure and pain are the great objects of desire and aversion: but\nthese are distinguished not by reason, but by immediate sense and\nfeeling. If virtue, therefore, is desirable for its own sake, and if\nvice is, in the same manner, the object of aversion, it cannot be reason\nwhich originally distinguishes those different qualities, but immediate\nsense and feeling.\nAs reason, however, in a certain sense, may justly be considered as the\nprinciple of approbation and disapprobation, these sentiments were,\nthrough inattention, long regarded as originally flowing from the\noperations of this faculty. Dr. Hutcheson had the merit of being the\nfirst who distinguished with any degree of precision in what respect all\nmoral distinctions may be said to arise from reason, and in what respect\nthey are founded upon immediate sense and feeling. In his illustrations\nupon the moral sense he has explained this so fully, and, in my opinion,\nso unanswerably, that, if any controversy is still kept up about this\nsubject, I can impute it to nothing, but either to inattention to what\nthat gentleman has written, or to a superstitious attachment to certain\nforms of expression, a weakness not very uncommon among the learned,\nespecially in subjects so deeply interesting as the present, in which a\nman of virtue is often loth to abandon, even the propriety of a single\nphrase which he has been accustomed to.\nCHAP. III.\n_Of those systems which make sentiment the principle of approbation._\nThose systems which make sentiment the principle of approbation may be\ndivided into two different classes.\nI. According to some the principle of approbation is founded upon a\nsentiment of a peculiar nature, upon a particular power of perception\nexerted by the mind at the view of certain actions or affections; some\nof which affecting this faculty in an agreeable and others in a\ndisagreeable manner, the former are stampt with the characters of right,\nlaudable, and virtuous; the latter with those of wrong, blameable and\nvicious. This sentiment being of a peculiar nature distinct from every\nother, and the effect of a particular power of perception, they give it\na particular name, and call it a moral sense.\nII. According to others, in order to account for the principle of\napprobation, there is no occasion for supposing any new power of\nperception which had never been heard of before: Nature, they imagine,\nacts here, as in all other cases, with the strictest \u0153conomy, and\nproduces a multitude of effects from one and the same cause; and\nsympathy, a power which has always been taken notice of, and with which\nthe mind is manifestly endowed, is, they think, sufficient to account\nfor all the effects ascribed to this peculiar faculty.\nI. Dr. Hutcheson[24] had been at great pains to prove that the principle\nof approbation was not founded on self-love. He had demonstrated too\nthat it could not arise from any operation of reason. Nothing remained,\nhe thought, but to suppose it a faculty of a peculiar kind, with which\nNature had endowed the human mind, in order to produce this one\nparticular and important effect. When self-love and reason were both\nexcluded, it did not occur to him that there was any other known faculty\nof the mind which could in any respect answer this purpose.\nFootnote 24:\nInquiry concerning Virtue.\nThis new power of perception he called a moral sense, and supposed it to\nbe somewhat analogous to the external senses. As the bodies around us,\nby affecting these in a certain manner, appear to possess the different\nqualities of sound, taste, odour, colour; so the various affections of\nthe human mind, by touching this particular faculty in a certain manner,\nappear to possess the different qualities of amiable and odious, of\nvirtuous and vicious, of right and wrong.\nThe various senses or powers of perception,[25] from which the human\nmind derives all its simple ideas, were, according to this system, of\ntwo different kinds, of which the one were called the direct or\nantecedent, the other, the reflex or consequent senses. The direct\nsenses were those faculties from which the mind derived the perception\nof such species of things as did not presuppose the antecedent\nperception of any other. Thus sounds and colours were objects of the\ndirect senses. To hear a sound or to see a colour does not presuppose\nthe antecedent perception of any other quality or object. The reflex or\nconsequent senses, on the other hand, were those faculties from which\nthe mind derived the perception of such species of things as presupposed\nthe antecedent perception of some other. Thus harmony and beauty were\nobjects of the reflex senses. In order to perceive the harmony of a\nsound, or the beauty of a colour, we must first perceive the sound or\nthe colour. The moral sense was considered as a faculty of this kind.\nThat faculty, which Mr. Locke calls reflection, and from which he\nderived the simple ideas of the different passions and emotions of the\nhuman mind, was, according to Dr. Hutcheson, a direct internal sense.\nThat faculty again by which we perceived the beauty or deformity, the\nvirtue or vice of those different passions and emotions, was a reflex,\ninternal sense.\nFootnote 25:\nTreatise of the passions.\nDr. Hutcheson endeavoured still further to support this doctrine, by\nshewing that it was agreeable to the analogy of nature, and that the\nmind was endowed with a variety of other reflex senses exactly similar\nto the moral sense; such as a sense of beauty and deformity in external\nobjects; a public sense, by which we sympathize with the happiness or\nmisery of our fellow-creatures; a sense of shame and honour, and a sense\nof ridicule.\nBut notwithstanding all the pains which this ingenious philosopher has\ntaken to prove that the principle of approbation is founded in a\npeculiar power of perception, somewhat analogous to the external senses,\nthere are some consequences, which he acknowledges to follow from this\ndoctrine, that will, perhaps, be regarded by many as a sufficient\nconfutation of it. The qualities, he allows,[26] which belong to the\nobjects of any sense, cannot, without the greatest absurdity, be\nascribed to the sense itself. Who ever thought of calling the sense of\nseeing black or white, the sense of hearing loud or low, or the sense of\ntasting sweet or bitter? And, according to him, it is equally absurd to\ncall our moral faculties virtuous or vicious, morally good or evil.\nThese qualities belong to the objects of those faculties, not to the\nfaculties themselves. If any man, therefore, was so absurdly constituted\nas to approve of cruelty and injustice as the highest virtues, and to\ndisapprove of equity and humanity as the most pitiful vices, such a\nconstitution of mind might indeed be regarded as inconvenient both to\nthe individual and to the society, and likewise as strange, surprising,\nand unnatural in itself; but it could not, without the greatest\nabsurdity, be denominated vicious or morally evil.\nFootnote 26:\nIllustrations upon the Moral Sense. Sect. 1. p. 237, et seq. Third\nEdition.\nYet surely if we saw any man shouting with admiration and applause at a\nbarbarous and unmerited execution, which some insolent tyrant had\nordered, we should not think we were guilty of any great absurdity in\ndenominating this behaviour vicious and morally evil in the highest\ndegree, though it expressed nothing but depraved moral faculties, or an\nabsurd approbation of this horrid action, as of what was noble,\nmagnanimous, and great. Our heart, I imagine, at the sight of such a\nspectator, would forget for a while its sympathy with the sufferer, and\nfeel nothing but horror and detestation, at the thought of so execrable\na wretch. We should abominate him even more than the tyrant who might be\ngoaded on by the strong passions of jealousy, fear, and resentment, and\nupon that account be more excusable. But the sentiments of the spectator\nwould appear altogether without cause or motive, and therefore most\nperfectly and completely detestable. There is no perversion of sentiment\nor affection which our heart would be more averse to enter into, or\nwhich it would reject with greater hatred and indignation than one of\nthis kind; and so far from regarding such a constitution of mind as\nbeing merely something strange or inconvenient, and not in any respect\nvicious or morally evil, we should rather consider it as the very last\nand most dreadful stage of moral depravity.\nCorrect moral sentiments, on the contrary, naturally appear in some\ndegree laudable and morally good. The man, whose censure and applause\nare upon all occasions suited with the greatest accuracy to the value or\nunworthiness of the object, seems to deserve a degree even of moral\napprobation. We admire the delicate precision of his moral sentiments:\nthey lead our own judgments, and, upon account of their uncommon and\nsurprising justness, they even excite our wonder and applause. We cannot\nindeed be always sure that the conduct of such a person would be in any\nrespect correspondent to the precision and accuracy of his judgments\nconcerning the conduct of others. Virtue requires habit and resolution\nof mind, as well as delicacy of sentiment; and unfortunately the former\nqualities are sometimes wanting, where the latter is in the greatest\nperfection. This disposition of mind, however, though it may sometimes\nbe attended with imperfections, is incompatible with any thing that is\ngrossly criminal, and is the happiest foundation upon which the\nsuperstructure of perfect virtue can be built. There are many men who\nmean very well, and seriously purpose to do what they think their duty,\nwho notwithstanding are disagreeable on account of the coarseness of\ntheir moral sentiments.\nIt may be said, perhaps, that though the principle of approbation is not\nfounded upon any power of perception that is in any respect analogous to\nthe external senses, it may still be founded upon a peculiar sentiment\nwhich answers this one particular purpose and no other. Approbation and\ndisapprobation, it may be pretended, are certain feelings or emotions\nwhich arise in the mind upon the view of different characters and\nactions; and as resentment might be called a sense of injuries, or\ngratitude a sense of benefits, so these may very properly receive the\nname of a sense of right and wrong, or of a moral sense.\nBut this account of things, though it may not be liable to the same\nobjections with the foregoing, is exposed to others which are equally\nunanswerable.\nFirst of all, whatever variations any particular emotion may undergo, it\nstill preserves the general features which distinguish it to be an\nemotion of such a kind, and these general features are always more\nstriking and remarkable than any variation which it may undergo in\nparticular cases. Thus anger is an emotion of a particular kind: and\naccordingly its general features are always more distinguishable than\nall the variations it undergoes in particular cases. Anger against a\nman, is, no doubt, somewhat different from anger against a woman, and\nthat again from anger against a child. In each of those three cases, the\ngeneral passion of anger receives a different modification from the\nparticular character of its object, as may easily be observed by the\nattentive. But still the general features of the passion predominate in\nall these cases. To distinguish these, requires no nice observation: a\nvery delicate attention, on the contrary, is necessary to discover their\nvariations: every body takes notice of the former: scarce any body\nobserves the latter. If approbation and disapprobation, therefore, were,\nlike gratitude and resentment, emotions of a particular kind, distinct\nfrom every other, we should expect that in all the variations which\neither of them might undergo, it would still retain the general features\nwhich mark it to be an emotion of such a particular kind, clear, plain,\nand easily distinguishable. But in fact it happens quite otherwise. If\nwe attend to what we really feel when upon different occasions we either\napprove or disapprove, we shall find that our emotion in one case is\noften totally different from that in another, and that no common\nfeatures can possibly be discovered between them. Thus the approbation\nwith which we view a tender, delicate, and humane sentiment, is quite\ndifferent from that with which we are struck by one that appears great,\ndaring, and magnanimous. Our approbation of both may, upon different\noccasions, be perfect and entire; but we are softened by the one, and we\nare elevated by the other, and there is no sort of resemblance between\nthe emotions which they excite in us. But, according to that system\nwhich I have been endeavouring to establish, this must necessarily be\nthe case. As the emotions of the person whom we approve of, are, in\nthose two cases, quite opposite to one another, and as our approbation\narises from sympathy with those opposite emotions, what we feel upon the\none occasion, can have no sort of resemblance to what we feel upon the\nother. But this could not happen if approbation consisted in a peculiar\nemotion which had nothing in common with the sentiments we approved of,\nbut which arose at the view of those sentiments, like any other passion\nat the view of its proper object. The same thing holds true with regard\nto disapprobation. Our horror for cruelty has no sort of resemblance to\nour contempt for mean-spiritedness. It is quite a different species of\ndiscord which we feel at the view of those two different vices, between\nour minds and those of the person whose sentiments and behaviour we\nconsider.\nSecondly, I have already observed, that not only the different passions\nor affections of the human mind which are approved or disapproved of\nappear morally good or evil, but that proper and improper approbation\nappear, to our natural sentiments, to be stampt with the same\ncharacters. I would ask, therefore, how it is, that, according to this\nsystem, we approve or disapprove of proper or improper approbation. To\nthis question, there is, I imagine, but one reasonable answer, which can\npossibly be given. It must be said, that when the approbation with which\nour neighbour regards the conduct of a third person coincides with our\nown, we approve of his approbation, and consider it as, in some measure,\nmorally good; and that on the contrary, when it does not coincide with\nour own sentiments, we disapprove of it, and consider it as, in some\nmeasure, morally evil. It must be allowed, therefore, that, at least in\nthis one case, the coincidence or opposition of sentiments, between the\nobserver and the person observed, constitutes moral approbation or\ndisapprobation. And if it does so in this one case, I would ask, why not\nin every other? to what purpose imagine a new power of perception in\norder to account for those sentiments?\nAgainst every account of the principle of approbation, which makes it\ndepend upon a peculiar sentiment, distinct from every other, I would\nobject; that it is strange that this sentiment, which Providence\nundoubtedly intended to be the governing principle of human nature,\nshould hitherto have been so little taken notice of, as not to have got\na name in any language. The word moral sense is of very late formation,\nand cannot yet be considered as making part of the English tongue. The\nword approbation has but within these few years been appropriated to\ndenote peculiarly any thing of this kind. In propriety of language we\napprove of whatever is entirely to our satisfaction, of the form of a\nbuilding, of the contrivance of a machine, of the flavour of a dish of\nmeat. The word conscience does not immediately denote any moral faculty\nby which we approve or disapprove. Conscience supposes, indeed, the\nexistence of some such faculty, and properly signifies our consciousness\nof having acted agreeably or contrary to its directions. When love,\nhatred, joy, sorrow, gratitude, resentment, with so many other passions\nwhich are all supposed to be the subjects of this principle, have made\nthemselves considerable enough to get titles to know them by, is it not\nsurprising that the sovereign of them all should hitherto have been so\nlittle heeded, that, a few philosophers excepted, no body has yet\nthought it worth while to bestow a name upon it?\nWhen we approve of any character or action, the sentiments which we\nfeel, are, according to the foregoing system, derived from four sources,\nwhich are in some respects different from one another. First, we\nsympathize with the motives of the agent; secondly, we enter into the\ngratitude of those who receive the benefit of his actions; thirdly, we\nobserve that his conduct has been agreeable to the general rules by\nwhich those two sympathies generally act; and, last of all, when we\nconsider such actions as making part of a system of behaviour which\ntends to promote the happiness either of the individual or of the\nsociety, they appear to derive a beauty from this utility, not unlike\nthat which we ascribe to any well contrived machine. After deducting, in\nany one particular case, all that must be acknowledged to proceed from\nsome one or other of these four principles, I should be glad to know\nwhat remains, and I shall freely allow this overplus to be ascribed to a\nmoral sense, or to any other peculiar faculty, provided any body will\nascertain precisely what this overplus is. It might be expected,\nperhaps, that if there was any such peculiar principle, such as this\nmoral sense is supposed to be, we should feel it, in some particular\ncases, separated and detached from every other, as we often feel joy,\nsorrow, hope, and fear, pure and unmixed with any other emotion. This\nhowever, I imagine, cannot even be pretended. I have never heard any\ninstance alleged in which this principle could be said to exert itself\nalone and unmixed with sympathy or antipathy, with gratitude or\nresentment, with the perception of the agreement or disagreement of any\naction to an established rule, or last of all with that general taste\nfor beauty and order which is excited by inanimated as well as by\nanimated objects.\nII. There is another system which attempts to account for the origin of\nour moral sentiments from sympathy distinct from that which I have been\nendeavouring to establish. It is that which places virtue in utility,\nand accounts for the pleasure with which the spectator surveys the\nutility of any quality from sympathy with the happiness of those who are\naffected by it. This sympathy is different both from that by which we\nenter into the motives of the agent, and from that by which we go along\nwith the gratitude of the persons who are benefited by his actions. It\nis the same principle with that by which we approve of a well contrived\nmachine. But no machine can be the object of either of those two last\nmentioned sympathies. I have already, in the fourth part of this\ndiscourse, given some account of this system.\nSECTION IV.\nOf the manner in which different authors have treated of the practical\nrules of morality.\nIt was observed in the third part of this discourse, that the rules of\njustice are the only rules of morality which are precise and accurate;\nthat those of all the other virtues are loose, vague, and indeterminate;\nthat the first may be compared to the rules of grammar; the others to\nthose which critics lay down for the attainment of what is sublime and\nelegant in composition, and which present us rather with a general idea\nof the perfection we ought to aim at, than afford us any certain and\ninfallible directions for acquiring it.\nAs the different rules of morality admit such different degrees of\naccuracy, those authors who have endeavoured to collect and digest them\ninto systems have done it in two different manners; and one set has\nfollowed thro\u2019 the whole that loose method to which they were naturally\ndirected by the consideration of one species of virtues; while another\nhas as universally endeavoured to introduce into their precepts that\nsort of accuracy of which only some of them are susceptible. The first\nhave wrote like critics, the second like grammarians.\nI. The first, among whom we may count all the ancient moralists, have\ncontented themselves with describing in a general manner the different\nvices and virtues, and with pointing out the deformity and misery of the\none disposition as well as the propriety and happiness of the other, but\nhave not affected to lay down many precise rules that are to hold good\nunexceptionably in all particular cases. They have only endeavoured to\nascertain, as far as language is capable of ascertaining, first, wherein\nconsists the sentiment of the heart, upon which each particular virtue\nis founded, what sort of internal feeling or emotion it is which\nconstitutes the essence of friendship, of humanity, of generosity, of\njustice, of magnanimity, and of all the other virtues, as well as of the\nvices which are opposed to them: and, secondly, What is the general way\nof acting, the ordinary tone and tenour of conduct to which each of\nthose sentiments would direct us, or how it is that a friendly, a\ngenerous, a brave, a just, and a humane man, would, upon ordinary\noccasions, chuse to act.\nTo characterize the sentiment of the heart, upon which each particular\nvirtue is founded, though it requires both a delicate and accurate\npencil, is a talk, however, which may be executed with some degree of\nexactness. It is impossible, indeed, to express all the variations which\neach sentiment either does or ought to undergo, according to every\npossible variation of circumstances. They are endless, and language\nwants names to mark them by. The sentiment of friendship, for example,\nwhich we feel for an old man is different from that which we feel for a\nyoung: that which we entertain for an austere man different from that\nwhich we feel for one of softer and gentler manners: and that again from\nwhat we feel for one of gay vivacity and spirit. The friendship which we\nconceive for a man is different from that with which a woman affects us,\neven where there is no mixture of any grosser passion. What author could\nenumerate and ascertain these and all the other infinite varieties which\nthis sentiment is capable of undergoing? But still the general sentiment\nof friendship and familiar attachment which is common to them all, may\nbe ascertained with a sufficient degree of accuracy. The picture which\nis drawn of it, though it will always be in many respects incomplete,\nmay, however, have such a resemblance as to make us know the original\nwhen we meet with it, and even distinguish it from other sentiments to\nwhich it has a considerable resemblance, such as good-will, respect,\nesteem, admiration.\nTo describe, in a general manner, what is the ordinary way of acting to\nwhich each virtue would prompt us, is still more easy. It is, indeed,\nscarce possible to describe the internal sentiment or emotion upon which\nit is founded, without doing something of this kind. It is impossible by\nlanguage to express, if I may say so, the invisible features of all the\ndifferent modifications of passion as they show themselves within. There\nis no other way of marking and distinguishing them from one another, but\nby describing the effects which they produce without, the alterations\nwhich they occasion in the countenance, in the air and external\nbehaviour, the resolutions they suggest, the actions they prompt to. It\nis thus that Cicero, in the first book of his Offices, endeavours to\ndirect us to the practice of the four cardinal virtues, and that\nAristotle in the practical parts of his Ethics, points out to us the\ndifferent habits by which he would have us regulate our behaviour, such\nas liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and even jocularity and good\nhumour, qualities, which that indulgent philosopher has thought worthy\nof a place in the catalogue of the virtues, though the lightness of that\napprobation which we naturally bestow upon them, should not seem to\nentitle them to so venerable a name.\nSuch works present us with agreeable and lively pictures of manners. By\nthe vivacity of their descriptions they inflame our natural love of\nvirtue, and increase our abhorrence of vice: by the justness as well as\ndelicacy of their observations they may often help both to correct and\nto ascertain our natural sentiments with regard to the propriety of\nconduct, and suggesting many nice and delicate attentions, form us to a\nmore exact justness of behaviour, than what, without such instruction,\nwe should have been apt to think of. In treating of the rules of\nmorality, in this manner, consists the science which is properly called\nEthics, a science, which though like criticism, it does not admit of the\nmost accurate precision, is, however, both highly useful and agreeable.\nIt is of all others the most susceptible of the embellishments of\neloquence, and by means of them of bestowing, if that be possible, a new\nimportance upon the smallest rules of duty. Its precepts, when thus\ndressed and adorned, are capable of producing upon the flexibility of\nyouth, the noblest and most lasting impressions, and as they fall in\nwith the natural magnanimity of that generous age, they are able to\ninspire, for a time at least, the most heroic resolutions, and thus tend\nboth to establish and confirm the best and most useful habits of which\nthe mind of man is susceptible. Whatever precept and exhortation can do\nto animate us to the practice of virtue, is done by this science\ndelivered in this manner.\nII. The second set of moralists, among whom we may count all the\ncasuists of the middle and latter ages of the christian church, as well\nas all those who in this and in the preceding century have treated of\nwhat is called natural jurisprudence, do not content themselves with\ncharacterizing in this general manner that tenour of conduct which they\nwould recommend to us, but endeavour to lay down exact and precise rules\nfor the direction of every circumstance of our behaviour. As justice is\nthe only virtue with regard to which such exact rules can properly be\ngiven; it is this virtue, that has chiefly fallen under the\nconsideration of those two different sets of writers. They treat of it,\nhowever, in a very different manner.\nThose who write upon the principles of jurisprudence, consider only what\nthe person to whom the obligation is due, ought to think himself\nentitled to exact by force; what every impartial spectator would approve\nof him for exacting, or what a judge or arbiter, to whom he had\nsubmitted his case, and who had undertaken to do him justice, ought to\noblige the other person to suffer or to perform. The casuists, on the\nother hand, do not so much examine what it is, that might properly be\nexacted by force, as what it is, that the person who owes the obligation\nought to think himself bound to perform from the most sacred and\nscrupulous regard to the general rules of justice, and from the most\nconscientious dread, either of wronging his neighbour, or of violating\nthe integrity of his own character. It is the end of jurisprudence to\nprescribe rules for the decisions of judges and arbiters. It is the end\nof casuistry to prescribe rules for the conduct of a good man. By\nobserving all the rules of jurisprudence, supposing them ever so\nperfect, we should deserve nothing but to be free from external\npunishment. By observing those of casuistry, supposing them such as they\nought to be, we should be entitled to considerable praise by the exact\nand scrupulous delicacy of our behaviour.\nIt may frequently happen that a good man ought to think himself bound,\nfrom a sacred and conscientious regard to the general rules of justice\nto perform many things which it would be the highest injustice to extort\nfrom him, or for any judge or arbiter to impose on him by force. To give\na trite example; a highwayman, by the fear of death, obliges a traveller\nto promise him a certain sum of money. Whether such a promise, extorted\nin this manner by unjust force, ought to be regarded as obligatory, is a\nquestion that has been very much debated.\nIf we consider it merely as a question of jurisprudence, the decision\ncan admit of no doubt. It would be absurd to suppose that the highwayman\ncan be entitled to use force to constrain the other to perform. To\nextort the promise was a crime which deserved the highest punishment,\nand to extort the performance would only be adding a new crime to the\nformer. He can complain of no injury who has been only deceived by the\nperson by whom he might justly have been killed. To suppose that a judge\nought to enforce the obligation of such promises, or that the magistrate\nought to allow them to sustain an action at law, would be the most\nridiculous of all absurdities. If we consider this question, therefore,\nas a question of jurisprudence, we can be at no loss about the decision.\nBut if we consider it as a question of casuistry, it will not be so\neasily determined. Whether a good man, from a conscientious regard to\nthat most sacred rule of justice, which commands the observance of all\nserious promises, would not think himself bound to perform, is at least\nmuch more doubtful. That no regard is due to the disappointment of the\nwretch who brings him into this situation, that no injury is done to the\nrobber, and consequently that nothing can be extorted by force, will\nadmit of no sort of dispute. But whether some regard is not, in this\ncase, due to his own dignity and honour, to the inviolable sacredness of\nthat part of his character which makes him reverence the law of truth,\nand abhor every thing that approaches to treachery and falsehood, may,\nperhaps, more reasonably be made a question. The casuists accordingly\nare greatly divided about it. One party, with whom we may count Cicero\namong the ancients, among the moderns, Puffendorf, Barbeyrac his\ncommentator, and above all the late Dr. Hutcheson, one who in most cases\nwas by no means a loose casuist, determine, without any hesitation, that\nno sort of regard is due to any such promise, and that to think\notherwise is mere weakness and superstition. Another party, among whom\nwe may reckon [27]some of the ancient fathers of the church, as well as\nsome very eminent modern casuists, have been of another opinion, and\nhave judged all such promises obligatory.\nFootnote 27:\nSt. Augustine, la Placette.\nIf we consider the matter according to the common sentiments of mankind,\nwe shall find that some regard would be thought due even to a promise of\nthis kind; but that it is impossible to determine how much, by any\ngeneral rule that will apply to all cases without exception. The man who\nwas quite frank and easy in making promises of this kind, and who\nviolated them with as little ceremony, we should not choose for our\nfriend and companion. A gentleman who should promise a highwayman five\npounds and not perform, would incur some blame. If the sum promised,\nhowever, was very great, it might be more doubtful, what was proper to\nbe done. If it was such, for example, that the payment of it would\nentirely ruin the family of the promiser, if it was so great as to be\nsufficient for promoting the most useful purposes, it would appear in\nsome measure criminal, at least extremely improper, to throw it, for the\nsake of a punctilio, into such worthless hands. The man who should\nbeggar himself, or who should throw away an hundred thousand pounds,\nthough he could afford that vast sum, for the sake of observing such a\nparole with a thief, would appear to the common sense of mankind, absurd\nand extravagant in the highest degree. Such profusion would seem\ninconsistent with his duty, with what he owed both to himself and\nothers, and what, therefore, regard, to a promise extorted in this\nmanner, could by no means authorize. To fix, however, by any precise\nrule, what degree of regard ought to be paid to it, or what might be the\ngreatest sum which could be due from it, is evidently impossible. This\nwould vary according to the characters of the persons, according to\ntheir circumstances, according to the solemnity of the promise, and even\naccording to the incidents of the rencounter: and if the promiser had\nbeen treated with a great deal of that sort of gallantry, which is\nsometimes to be met with in persons of the most abandoned characters,\nmore would seem due than upon other occasions. It may be said in\ngeneral, that exact propriety requires the observance of all such\npromises, whenever it is not inconsistent with some other duties that\nare more sacred; such as regard to the public interest, to those whom\ngratitude, whom natural affection, or whom the laws of proper\nbeneficence should prompt us to provide for. But, as was formerly taken\nnotice of, we have no precise rules to determine what external actions\nare due from a regard to such motives, nor, consequently, when it is\nthat those virtues are inconsistent with the observance of such\npromises.\nIt is to be observed, however, that whenever such promises are violated,\nthough for the most necessary reasons, it is always with some degree of\ndishonour to the person who made them. After they are made, we may be\nconvinced of the impropriety of observing them. But still there is some\nfault in having made them. It is at least a departure from the highest\nand noblest maxims of magnanimity and honour. A brave man ought to die,\nrather than make a promise which he can neither keep without folly, nor\nviolate without ignominy. For some degree of ignominy always attends a\nsituation of this kind. Treachery and falsehood are vices so dangerous,\nso dreadful, and, at the same time, such as may so easily, and, upon\nmany occasions, so safely be indulged, that we are more jealous of them\nthan of almost any other. Our imagination therefore attaches the idea of\nshame to all violations of faith, in every circumstance and in every\nsituation. They resemble, in this respect, the violations of chastity in\nthe fair sex, a virtue of which, for the like reasons, we are\nexcessively jealous; and our sentiments are not more delicate with\nregard to the one, than with regard to the other. Breach of chastity\ndishonours irretrievably. No circumstances, no solicitation can excuse\nit; no sorrow, no repentance atone for it. We are so nice in this\nrespect that even a rape dishonours, and the innocence of the mind\ncannot, in our imagination, wash out the pollution of the body. It is\nthe same case with the violation of faith, when it has been solemnly\npledged, even to the most worthless of mankind. Fidelity is so necessary\na virtue, that we apprehend it in general to be due even to those to\nwhom nothing else is due, and whom we think it lawful to kill and\ndestroy. It is to no purpose that the person who has been guilty of the\nbreach of it, urges that he promised in order to save his life, and that\nhe broke his promise because it was inconsistent with some other\nrespectable duty to keep it. These circumstances may alleviate, but\ncannot entirely wipe out his dishonour. He appears to have been guilty\nof an action with which, in the imaginations of men, some degree of\nshame is inseparably connected. He has broke a promise which he had\nsolemnly averred he would maintain; and his character, if not\nirretrievably stained and polluted, has at least a ridicule affixed to\nit, which it will be very difficult entirely to efface; and no man, I\nimagine, who had gone through an adventure of this kind, would be fond\nof telling the story.\nThis instance may serve to show wherein consists the difference between\ncasuistry and jurisprudence, even when both of them consider the\nobligations of the general rules of justice.\nBut though this difference be real and essential, though those two\nsciences propose quite different ends, the sameness of the subject has\nmade such a similarity between them, that the greater part of authors\nwhose professed design was to treat of jurisprudence, have determined\nthe different questions they examine, sometimes according to the\nprinciples of that science, and sometimes according to those of\ncasuistry, without distinguishing, and, perhaps, without being\nthemselves aware when they did the one, and when the other.\nThe doctrine of the casuists, however, is by no means confined to the\nconsideration of what a conscientious regard to the general rules of\njustice, would demand of us. It embraces many other parts of Christian\nand moral duty. What seems principally to have given occasion to the\ncultivation of this species of science was the custom of auricular\nconfession, introduced by the Roman Catholic superstition, in times of\nbarbarism and ignorance. By that institution, the most secret actions,\nand even the thoughts of every person, which could be suspected of\nreceding in the smallest degree from the rules of Christian purity, were\nto be revealed to the confessor. The confessor informed his penitents\nwhether, and in what respect they had violated their duty, and what\npenance it behoved them to undergo, before he could absolve them in the\nname of the offended Deity.\nThe consciousness, or even the suspicion of having done wrong, is a load\nupon every mind, and is accompanied with anxiety and terror in all those\nwho are not hardened by long habits of iniquity. Men, in this, as in all\nother distresses, are naturally eager to disburthen themselves of the\noppression which they feel upon their thoughts, by unbosoming the agony\nof their mind to some person whose secrecy and discretion they can\nconfide in. The shame, which they suffer from this acknowledgment, is\nfully compensated by that alleviation of their uneasiness which the\nsympathy of their confident seldom fails to occasion. It relieves them\nto find that they are not altogether unworthy of regard, and that\nhowever their past conduct may be censured, their present disposition is\nat least approved of, and is perhaps sufficient to compensate the other,\nat least to maintain them in some degree of esteem with their friend. A\nnumerous and artful clergy had, in those times of superstition,\ninsinuated themselves into the confidence of almost every private\nfamily. They possessed all the little learning which the times could\nafford, and their manners, though in many respects rude and disorderly,\nwere polished and regular compared with those of the age they lived in.\nThey were regarded, therefore, not only as the great directors of all\nreligious, but of all moral duties. Their familiarity gave reputation to\nwhoever was so happy as to possess it, and every mark of their\ndisapprobation stamped the deepest ignominy upon all who had the\nmisfortune to fall under it. Being considered as the great judges of\nright and wrong, they were naturally consulted about all scruples that\noccurred, and it was reputable for any person to have it known that he\nmade those holy men the confidents of all such secrets, and took no\nimportant or delicate step in his conduct without their advice and\napprobation. It was not difficult for the clergy, therefore, to get it\nestablished as a general rule, that they should be entrusted with what\nit had already become fashionable to entrust them, and with what they\ngenerally would have been entrusted though no such rule had been\nestablished. To qualify themselves for confessors became thus a\nnecessary part of the study of churchmen and divines, and they were\nthence led to collect what are called cases of conscience, nice and\ndelicate situations, in which it is hard to determine whereabouts the\npropriety of conduct may lie. Such works, they imagined, might be of use\nboth to the directors of consciences and to those who were to be\ndirected; and hence the origin of books of casuistry.\nThe moral duties which fell under the consideration of the casuists were\nchiefly those which can, in some measure at least, be circumscribed\nwithin general rules, and of which the violation is naturally attended\nwith some degree of remorse and some dread of suffering punishment. The\ndesign of that institution which gave occasion to their works, was to\nappease those terrors of conscience which attend upon the infringement\nof such duties. But it is not every virtue of which the defect is\naccompanied with any very severe compunctions of this kind, and no man\napplies to his confessor for absolution, because he did not perform the\nmost generous, the most friendly, or the most magnanimous action which,\nin his circumstances, it was possible to perform. In failures of this\nkind, the rule that is violated is commonly not very determinate, and is\ngenerally of such a nature too, that though the observance of it might\nentitle to honour and reward, the violation seems to expose to no\npositive blame, censure, or punishment. The exercise of such virtues the\ncasuists seem to have regarded as a sort of works of supererogation,\nwhich could not be very strictly enacted, and which it was therefore\nunnecessary for them to treat of.\nThe breaches of moral duty, therefore, which came before the tribunal of\nthe confessor, and upon that account fell under the cognizance of the\ncasuists, were chiefly of three different kinds.\nFirst and principally, breaches of the rules of justice. The rules here\nare all express and positive, and the violation of them is naturally\nattended with the consciousness of deserving, and the dread of suffering\npunishment both from God and man.\nSecondly, breaches of the rules of chastity. These in all grosser\ninstances are real breaches of the rules of justice, and no person can\nbe guilty of them without doing the most unpardonable injury to some\nother. In smaller instances, when they amount only to a violation of\nthose exact decorums which ought to be observed in the conversation of\nthe two sexes, they cannot indeed justly be considered as violations of\nthe rules of justice. They are generally, however, violations of a\npretty plain rule, and, at least in one of the sexes, tend to bring\nignominy upon the person who has been guilty of them, and consequently\nto be attended in the scrupulous with some degree of shame and\ncontrition of mind.\nThirdly, breaches of the rules of veracity. The violation of truth, it\nis to be observed, is not always a breach of justice, though it is so\nupon many occasions, and consequently cannot always expose to any\nexternal punishment. The vice of common lying, though a most miserable\nmeanness, may frequently do hurt to no person, and in this case no claim\nof vengeance or satisfaction can be due either to the persons imposed\nupon, or to others. But though the violation of truth is not always a\nbreach of justice, it is always a breach of a very plain rule, and what\nnaturally tends to cover with shame the person who has been guilty of\nit. The great pleasure of conversation, and indeed of society, arises\nfrom a certain correspondence of sentiments and opinions, from a certain\nharmony of minds, which like so many musical instruments coincide and\nkeep time with one another. But this most delightful harmony cannot be\nobtained unless there is a free communication of sentiments and\nopinions. We all desire, upon this account, to feel how each other is\naffected, to penetrate into each other\u2019s bosoms, and to observe the\nsentiments and affections which really subsist there. The man who\nindulges us in this natural passion, who invites us into his heart, who,\nas it were, sets open the gates of his breast to us, seems to exercise a\nspecies of hospitality more delightful than any other. No man, who is in\nordinary good temper, can fail of pleasing, if he has the courage to\nutter his real sentiments as he feels them, and because he feels them.\nIt is this unreserved sincerity which renders even the prattle of a\nchild agreeable. How weak and imperfect soever the views of the\nopen-hearted, we take pleasure to enter into them, and endeavour, as\nmuch as we can, to bring down our own understanding to the level of\ntheir capacities, and to regard every subject in the particular light in\nwhich they appear to have considered it. This passion to discover the\nreal sentiments of others is naturally so strong, that it often\ndegenerates into a troublesome and impertinent curiosity to pry into\nthose secrets of our neighbours which they have very justifiable reasons\nfor concealing, and, upon many occasions, it requires prudence and a\nstrong sense of propriety to govern this, as well as all the other\npassions of human nature, and to reduce it to that pitch which any\nimpartial spectator can approve of. To disappoint this curiosity,\nhowever, when it is kept within proper bounds, and aims at nothing which\nthere can be any just reason for concealing, is equally disagreeable in\nits turn. The man who eludes our most innocent questions, who gives no\nsatisfaction to our most inoffensive inquiries, who plainly wraps\nhimself up in impenetrable obscurity, seems, as it were, to build a wall\nabout his breast. We run forward to get within it, with all the\neagerness of harmless curiosity, and feel ourselves all at once pushed\nback with the rudest and most offensive violence. If to conceal is so\ndisagreeable, to attempt to deceive us is still more disgusting, even\nthough we could possibly suffer nothing by the success of the fraud. If\nwe see that our companion wants to impose upon us, if the sentiments and\nopinions which he utters appear evidently not to be his own, let them be\never so fine, we can derive no sort of entertainment from them; and if\nsomething of human nature did not now and then transpire through all the\ncovers which falsehood and affectation are capable of wrapping around\nit, a puppet of wood would be altogether as pleasant a companion as a\nperson who never spoke as he was affected. No man ever deceives, with\nregard to the most insignificant matters, who is not conscious of doing\nsomething like an injury to those he converses with; and who does not\ninwardly blush and shrink back with shame and confusion even at the\nsecret thought of a detection. Breach of veracity, therefore, being\nalways attended with some degree of remorse and self-condemnation,\nnaturally fell under the cognizance of the casuists.\nThe chief subjects of the works of the casuists, therefore, were the\nconscientious regard that is due to the rules of justice; how far we\nought to respect the life and property of our neighbour; the duty of\nrestitution; the laws of chastity and modesty, and wherein consisted\nwhat, in their language, are called the sins of concupiscence: the rules\nof veracity, and the obligation of oaths, promises, and contracts of all\nkinds.\nIt may be said in general of the works of the casuists that they\nattempted, to no purpose, to direct by precise rules what belongs to\nfeeling and sentiment only to judge of. How is it possible to ascertain\nby rules the exact point at which, in every case, a delicate sense of\njustice begins to run into a frivolous and weak scrupulosity of\nconscience? When it is that secrecy and reserve begin to grow into\ndissimulation? How far an agreeable irony may be carried, and at what\nprecise point it begins to degenerate into a detestable lie? What is the\nhighest pitch of freedom and ease of behaviour which can be regarded as\ngraceful and becoming, and when it is that it first begins to run into a\nnegligent and thoughtless licentiousness? With regard to all such\nmatters, what would hold good in any one case would scarce do so exactly\nin any other, and what constitutes the propriety and happiness of\nbehaviour varies in every case with the smallest variety of situation.\nBooks of casuistry, therefore, are generally as useless as they are\ncommonly tiresome. They could be of little use to one who should consult\nthem upon occasion, even supposing their decisions to be just; because,\nnotwithstanding the multitude of cases collected in them, yet upon\naccount of the still greater variety of possible circumstances, it is a\nchance, if among all those cases there be found one exactly parallel to\nthat under consideration. One, who is really anxious to do his duty,\nmust be very weak, if he can imagine that he has much occasion for them;\nand with regard to one who is negligent of it, the style of those\nwritings is not such as is likely to awaken him to more attention. None\nof them tend to animate us to what is generous and noble. None of them\ntend to soften us to what is gentle and humane. Many of them, on the\ncontrary, tend rather to teach us to chicane with our own consciences,\nand by their vain subtilties serve to authorize innumerable evasive\nrefinements with regard to the most essential articles of our duty. That\nfrivolous accuracy which they attempted to introduce into subjects which\ndo not admit of it, almost necessarily betrayed them into those\ndangerous errors, and at the same time rendered their works dry and\ndisagreeable, abounding in abstruse and metaphysical distinctions, but\nincapable of exciting in the heart any of those emotions which it is the\nprincipal use of books of morality to excite.\nThe two useful parts of moral philosophy, therefore, are Ethics and\nJurisprudence: casuistry ought to be rejected altogether, and the\nancient moralists appear to have judged much better, who, in treating of\nthe same subjects, did not affect any such nice exactness, but contented\nthemselves with describing, in a general manner, what is the sentiment\nupon which justice, modesty, and veracity are founded, and what is the\nordinary way of acting to which those virtues would commonly prompt us.\nSomething, indeed, not unlike the doctrine of the casuists, seems to\nhave been attempted by several philosophers. There is something of this\nkind in the third book of Cicero\u2019s Offices, where he endeavours like a\ncasuist to give rules for our conduct in many nice cases, in which it is\ndifficult to determine whereabouts the point of propriety may lie. It\nappears too, from many passages in the same book, that several other\nphilosophers had attempted something of the same kind before him.\nNeither he nor they, however, appear to have aimed at giving a complete\nsystem of this sort, but only meant to show how situations may occur, in\nwhich it is doubtful, whether the highest propriety of conduct consists\nin observing or in receding from what, in ordinary cases, are the rules\nof duty.\nEvery system of positive law may be regarded as a more or less imperfect\nattempt towards a system of natural jurisprudence, or towards an\nenumeration of the particular rules of justice. As the violation of\njustice is what men will never submit to from one another, the public\nmagistrate is under a necessity of employing the power of the\ncommonwealth to enforce the practice of this virtue. Without this\nprecaution, civil society would become a scene of bloodshed and\ndisorder, every man revenging himself at his own hand whenever he\nfancied he was injured. To prevent the confusion which would attend upon\nevery man\u2019s doing justice to himself, the magistrate, in all governments\nthat have acquired any considerable authority, undertakes to do justice\nto all, and promises to hear and to redress every complaint of injury.\nIn all well-governed states too, not only judges are appointed for\ndetermining the controversies of individuals, but rules are prescribed\nfor regulating the decisions of those judges; and these rules are, in\ngeneral, intended to coincide with those of natural justice. It does\nnot, indeed, always happen that they do so in every instance. Sometimes\nwhat is called the constitution of the state, that is, the interest of\nthe government; sometimes of the interest of particular orders of men\nwho tyrannize the government, warp the positive laws of the country from\nwhat natural justice would prescribe. In some countries, the rudeness\nand barbarism of the people hinder the natural sentiments of justice\nfrom arriving at that accuracy and precision which, in more civilized\nnations, they naturally attain to. Their laws are, like their manners,\ngross and rude and undistinguishing. In other countries the unfortunate\nconstitution of their courts of judicature hinders any regular system of\njurisprudence from ever establishing itself among them, though the\nimproved manners of the people may be such as would admit of the most\naccurate. In no country do the decisions of positive law coincide\nexactly, in every case, with the rules which the natural sense of\njustice would dictate. Systems of positive law, therefore, though they\ndeserve the greatest authority, as the records of the sentiments of\nmankind in different ages and nations, yet can never be regarded as\naccurate systems of the rules of natural justice.\nIt might have been expected that the reasonings of lawyers, upon the\ndifferent imperfections and improvements of the laws of different\ncountries, should have given occasion to an inquiry into what were the\nnatural rules of justice independent of all positive institution. It\nmight have been expected that these reasonings should have led them to\naim at establishing a system of what might properly be called natural\njurisprudence, or a theory of the general principles which ought to run\nthrough and be the foundation of the laws of all nations. But tho\u2019 the\nreasonings of lawyers did produce something of this kind, and though no\nman has treated systematically of the laws of any particular country,\nwithout intermixing in his work many observations of this sort; it was\nvery late in the world before any such general system was thought of, or\nbefore the philosophy of law was treated of by itself, and without\nregard to the particular institutions of any one nation. In none of the\nancient moralists, do we find any attempt towards a particular\nenumeration of the rules of justice. Cicero in his Offices, and\nAristotle in his Ethics, treat of justice in the same general manner in\nwhich they treat of all the other virtues. In the laws of Cicero and\nPlato, where we might naturally have expected some attempts towards an\nenumeration of those rules of natural equity, which ought to be enforced\nby the positive laws of every country, there is however, nothing of this\nkind. Their laws are laws of police, not of justice. Grotius seems to\nhave been the first, who attempted to give the world any thing like a\nsystem of those principles which ought to run through, and be the\nfoundation of the laws of all nations; and his treatise of the laws of\nwar and peace, with all its imperfections, is perhaps at this day the\nmost complete work that has yet been given upon this subject. I shall in\nanother discourse endeavour to give an account of the general principles\nof law and government, and of the different revolutions they have\nundergone in the different ages and periods of society, not only in what\nconcerns justice, but in what concerns police, revenue, and arms, and\nwhatever else is the object of law. I shall not, therefore, at present\nenter into any further detail concerning the history of jurisprudence.\nTHE END.\nCONSIDERATIONS\nConcerning the FIRST\nFORMATION OF LANGUAGES,\nAND THE\nDifferent Genius of original and compounded LANGUAGES.\nThe assignation of particular names, to denote particular objects, that\nis, the institution of nouns substantive, would, probably, be one of the\nfirst steps towards the formation of language. Two savages, who had\nnever been taught to speak, but had been bred up remote from the\nsocieties of men, would naturally begin to form that language by which\nthey would endeavour to make their mutual wants intelligible to each\nother, by uttering certain sounds, whenever they meant to denote certain\nobjects. Those objects only which were most familiar to them, and which\nthey had most frequent occasion to mention, would have particular names\nassigned to them. The particular cave whose covering sheltered them from\nthe weather, the particular tree whose fruit relieved their hunger, the\nparticular fountain whose water allayed their thirst, would first be\ndenoted by the words _cave_, _tree_, _fountain_, or by whatever other\nappellations they might think proper, in that primitive jargon, to mark\nthem. Afterwards, when the more enlarged experience of these savages had\nled them to observe, and their necessary occasions obliged them to make\nmention of, other caves, and other trees, and other fountains, they\nwould naturally bestow, upon each of those new objects, the same name,\nby which they had been accustomed to express the similar object they\nwere first acquainted with. The new objects had none of them any name of\nits own, but each of them exactly resembled another object, which had\nsuch an appellation. It was impossible that those savages could behold\nthe new objects, without recollecting the old ones; and the name of the\nold ones, to which the new bore so close a resemblance. When they had\noccasion, therefore, to mention, or to point out to each other, any of\nthe new objects, they would naturally utter the name of the\ncorrespondent old one, of which the idea could not fail, at that\ninstant, to present itself to their memory in the strongest and\nliveliest manner. And thus, those words, which were originally the\nproper names of individuals, would each of them insensibly become the\ncommon name of a multitude. A child that is just learning to speak,\ncalls every person who comes to the house its papa or its mama; and thus\nbestows upon the whole species those names which it had been taught to\napply to two individuals. I have known a clown, who did not know the\nproper name of the river which ran by his own door. It was _the river_,\nhe said, and he never heard any other name for it. His experience, it\nseems, had not led him to observe any other river. The general word\n_river_, therefore, was, it is evident, in his acceptance of it, a\nproper name, signifying an individual object. If this person had been\ncarried to another river, would he not readily have called it a river?\nCould we suppose any person living on the banks of the Thames so\nignorant, as not to know the general word _river_, but to be acquainted\nonly with the particular word _Thames_, if he was brought to any other\nriver, would he not readily call it a _Thames_? This, in reality, is no\nmore than what they, who are well acquainted with the general word, are\nvery apt to do. An Englishman, describing any great river which he may\nhave seen in some foreign country, naturally says, that it is another\nThames. The Spaniards, when they first arrived upon the coast of Mexico,\nand observed the wealth, populousness, and habitations of that fine\ncountry, so much superior to the savage nations which they had been\nvisiting for some time before, cried out, that it was another Spain.\nHence it was called New Spain; and this name has stuck to that\nunfortunate country ever since. We say, in the same manner, of a hero,\nthat he is an Alexander; of an orator, that he is a Cicero; of a\nphilosopher, that he is a Newton. This way of speaking, which the\ngrammarians call an Antonomasia, and which is still extremely common,\nthough now not at all necessary, demonstrates how much mankind are\nnaturally disposed to give to one object the name of any other, which\nnearly resembles it, and thus to denominate a multitude, by what\noriginally was intended to express an individual.\nIt is this application of the name of an individual to a great multitude\nof objects, whose resemblance naturally recalls the idea of that\nindividual, and of the name which expresses it, that seems originally to\nhave given occasion to the formation of those classes and assortments,\nwhich, in the schools, are called genera and species, and of which the\ningenious and eloquent M. Rousseau of Geneva[28], finds himself so much\nat a loss to account for the origin. What constitutes a species is\nmerely a number of objects, bearing a certain degree of resemblance to\none another, and on that account denominated by a single appellation,\nwhich may be applied to express any one of them.\nFootnote 28:\nOrigine de l\u2019Inegalit\u00e9. Partie premiere, p. 376, 377, Edition\nd\u2019Amsterdam, des Oeuvres diverses de J. J. Rousseau.\nWhen the greater part of objects had thus been arranged under their\nproper classes and assortments, distinguished by such general names, it\nwas impossible that the greater part of that almost infinite number of\nindividuals, comprehended under each particular assortment or species,\ncould have any peculiar or proper names of their own, distinct from the\ngeneral name of the species. When there was occasion, therefore, to\nmention any particular object, it often became necessary to distinguish\nit from the other objects comprehended under the same general name,\neither, first, by its peculiar qualities; or, secondly, by the peculiar\nrelation which it stood in to some other things. Hence the necessary\norigin of two other sets of words, of which the one should express\nquality; the other relation.\nNouns adjective are the words which express quality considered as\nqualifying, or, as the schoolmen say, in concrete with, some particular\nsubject. Thus the word _green_ expresses a certain quality considered as\nqualifying, or as in concrete with, the particular subject to which it\nmay be applied. Words of this kind, it is evident, may serve to\ndistinguish particular objects from others comprehended under the same\ngeneral appellation. The words _green tree_, for example, might serve to\ndistinguish a particular tree from others that were withered or blasted.\nPrepositions are the words which express relation considered, in the\nsame manner, in concrete with the co-relative object. Thus the\nprepositions _of_, _to_, _for_, _with_, _by_, _above_, _below_, _&c._\ndenote some relation subsisting between the objects expressed by the\nwords between which the prepositions are placed; and they denote that\nthis relation is considered in concrete with the co-relative object.\nWords of this kind serve to distinguish particular objects from others\nof the same species, when those particular objects cannot be so properly\nmarked out by any peculiar qualities of their own. When we say, _the\ngreen tree of the meadow_, for example, we distinguish a particular\ntree, not only by the quality which belongs to it, but by the relation\nwhich it stands in to another object.\nAs neither quality nor relation can exist in abstract, it is natural to\nsuppose that the words which denote them considered in concrete, the way\nin which we always see them subsist, would be of much earlier invention,\nthan those which express them considered in abstract, the way in which\nwe never see them subsist. The words _green_ and _blue_ would, in all\nprobability, be sooner invented than the words _greenness_ and\n_blueness_; the words _above_ and _below_, than the words _superiority_\nand _inferiority_. To invent words of the latter kind requires a much\ngreater effort of abstraction than to invent those of the former. It is\nprobable, therefore, that such abstract terms would be of much later\ninstitution. Accordingly, their etymologies generally show that they are\nso, they being generally derived from others that are concrete.\nBut though the invention of nouns adjective be much more natural than\nthat of the abstract nouns substantive derived from them, it would\nstill, however, require a considerable degree of abstraction and\ngeneralization. Those, for example, who first invented the words,\n_green_, _blue_, _red_, and the other names of colours, must have\nobserved and compared together a great number of objects, must have\nremarked their resemblances and dissimilitudes in respect of the quality\nof colour, and must have arranged them, in their own minds, into\ndifferent classes and assortments, according to those resemblances and\ndissimilitudes. An adjective is by nature a general, and in some\nmeasure, an abstract word, and necessarily presupposes the idea of a\ncertain species or assortment of things, to all of which it is equally\napplicable. The word _green_ could not, as we were supposing might be\nthe case of the word _cave_, have been originally the name of an\nindividual, and afterwards have become, by what grammarians call an\nAntonomasia the name of a species. The word _green_ denoting, not the\nname of a substance, but the peculiar quality of a substance, must from\nthe very first have been a general word, and considered as equally\napplicable to any other substance possessed of the same quality. The man\nwho first distinguished a particular object by the epithet of _green_,\nmust have observed other objects that were not _green_, from which he\nmeant to separate it by this appellation. The institution of this name,\ntherefore, supposes comparison. It likewise supposes some degree of\nabstraction. The person who first invented this appellation must have\ndistinguished the quality from the object to which it belonged, and must\nhave conceived the object as capable of subsisting without the quality.\nThe invention, therefore, even of the simplest nouns adjective, must\nhave required more metaphysics than we are apt to be aware of. The\ndifferent mental operations, of arrangement or classing, of comparison,\nand of abstraction, must all have been employed, before even the names\nof the different colours, the least metaphysical of all nouns adjective,\ncould be instituted. From all which I infer, that when languages were\nbeginning to be formed, nouns adjective would by no means be the words\nof the earliest invention.\nThere is another expedient for denoting the different qualities of\ndifferent substances, which as it requires no abstraction, nor any\nconceived separation of the quality from the subject, seems more natural\nthan the invention of nouns adjective, and which, upon this account,\ncould hardly fail, in the first formation of language, to be thought of\nbefore them. This expedient is to make some variation upon the noun\nsubstantive itself, according to the different qualities which it is\nendowed with. Thus, in many languages, the qualities both of sex and of\nthe want of sex, are expressed by different terminations in the nouns\nsubstantive, which denote objects so qualified. In Latin, for example,\n_lupus_, _lupa_; _equus_, _equa_; _juvencus_, _juvenca_; _Julius_,\n_Julia_; _Lucretius_, _Lucretia_, &c. denote the qualities of male and\nfemale in the animals and persons to whom such appellations belong,\nwithout needing the addition of any adjective for this purpose. On the\nother hand, the words _forum_, _pratum_, _plaustrum_, denote by their\npeculiar termination the total absence of sex in the different\nsubstances which they stand for. Both sex, and the want of all sex,\nbeing naturally considered as qualities modifying and inseparable from\nthe particular substances to which they belong, it was natural to\nexpress them rather by a modification in the noun substantive, than by\nany general and abstract word expressive of this particular species of\nquality. The expression bears, it is evident, in this way, a much more\nexact analogy to the idea or object which it denotes, than in the other.\nThe quality appears, in nature, as a modification of the substance, and\nas it is thus expressed, in language, by a modification of the noun\nsubstantive, which denotes that substance, the quality and the subject\nare, in this case, blended together, if I may say so, in the expression,\nin the same manner, as they appear to be in the object and in the idea.\nHence the origin of the masculine, feminine, and neutral genders, in all\nthe ancient languages. By means of these, the most important of all\ndistinctions, that of substances into animated and inanimated, and that\nof animals into male and female, seem to have been sufficiently marked\nwithout the assistance of adjectives, or of any general names denoting\nthis most extensive species of qualifications.\nThere are no more than these three genders in any of the languages with\nwhich I am acquainted; that is to say, the formation of nouns\nsubstantive, can, by itself, and without the accompaniment of\nadjectives, express no other qualities but those three above-mentioned,\nthe qualities of male, of female, of neither male nor female. I should\nnot, however, be surprised, if, in other languages with which I am\nunacquainted, the different formations of nouns substantive should be\ncapable of expressing many other different qualities. The different\ndiminutives of the Italian, and of some other languages, do, in reality,\nsometimes, express a great variety of different modifications in the\nsubstances denoted by those nouns which undergo such variations.\nIt was impossible, however, that nouns substantive could, without losing\naltogether their original form, undergo so great a number of variations,\nas would be sufficient to express that almost infinite variety of\nqualities, by which it might, upon different occasions, be necessary to\nspecify and distinguish them. Though the different formation of nouns\nsubstantive, therefore, might, for some time, forestall the necessity of\ninventing nouns adjective, it was impossible that this necessity could\nbe forestalled altogether. When nouns adjective came to be invented, it\nwas natural that they should be formed with some similarity to the\nsubstantives, to which they were to serve as epithets or qualifications.\nMen would naturally give them the same terminations with the\nsubstantives to which they were first applied, and from that love of\nsimilarity of sound, from that delight in the returns of the same\nsyllables, which is in the foundation of analogy in all languages, they\nwould be apt to vary the termination of the same adjective, according as\nthey had occasion to apply it to a masculine, to a feminine, or to a\nneutral substantive. They would say, _magnus lupus_, _magna lupa_,\n_magnum pratum_, when they meant to express a great he wolf, a great\n_she wolf_, a great _meadow_.\nThis variation, in the termination of the noun adjective, according to\nthe gender of the substantive, which takes place in all the ancient\nlanguages, seems to have been introduced chiefly for the sake of a\ncertain similarity of sound, of a certain species of rhyme, which is\nnaturally so very agreeable to the human ear. Gender, it is to be\nobserved, cannot properly belong to a noun adjective, the signification\nof which is always precisely the same, to whatever species of\nsubstantives it is applied. When we say, _a great man_, _a great woman_,\nthe word _great_ has precisely the same meaning in both cases, and the\ndifference of the sex in the subjects to which it may be applied, makes\nno sort of difference in its signification. _Magnus_, _magna_, _magnum_,\nin the same manner, are words which express precisely the same quality,\nand the change of the termination is accompanied with no sort of\nvariation in the meaning. Sex and gender are qualities which belong to\nsubstances, but cannot belong to the qualities of substances. In\ngeneral, no quality, when considered in concrete, or as qualifying some\nparticular subject, can itself be conceived as the subject of any other\nquality; though when considered in abstract it may. No adjective\ntherefore can qualify any other adjective. A _great good man_, means a\nman who is both _great_ and _good_. Both the adjectives qualify the\nsubstantive; they do not qualify one another. On the other hand, when we\nsay, the _great goodness_ of the man, the word _goodness_ denoting a\nquality considered in abstract, which may itself be the subject of other\nqualities, is upon that account capable of being qualified by the word,\n_great_.\nIf the original invention of nouns adjective would be attended with so\nmuch difficulty, that of prepositions would be accompanied with yet\nmore. Every preposition, as I have already observed, denotes some\nrelation considered in concrete with the co-relative object. The\npreposition _above_, for example, denotes the relation of superiority,\nnot in abstract, as it is expressed by the word _superiority_, but in\nconcrete with some co-relative object. In this phrase, for example, _the\ntree above the cave_, the word _above_, expresses a certain relation\nbetween the _tree_ and the _cave_, and it expresses this relation in\nconcrete with the co-relative object, the _cave_. A preposition always\nrequires, in order to complete the sense, some other word to come after\nit; as may be observed in this particular instance. Now, I say, the\noriginal invention of such words would require a yet greater effort of\nabstraction and generalization, than that of nouns adjective. First of\nall, a relation is, in itself, a more metaphysical object than a\nquality. Nobody can be at a loss to explain what is meant by a quality;\nbut few people will find themselves able to express, very distinctly,\nwhat is understood by a relation. Qualities are almost always the\nobjects of our external senses; relations never are. No wonder,\ntherefore, that the one set of objects should be so much more\ncomprehensible than the other. Secondly, though prepositions always\nexpress the relation which they stand for, in concrete with the\nco-relative object, they could not have originally been formed without a\nconsiderable effort of abstraction. A preposition denotes a relation,\nand nothing but a relation. But before men could institute a word, which\nsignified a relation, and nothing but a relation, they must have been\nable, in some measure, to consider this relation abstractedly from the\nrelated objects; since the idea of those objects does not, in any\nrespect, enter into the signification of the preposition. The invention\nof such a word, therefore, must have required a considerable degree of\nabstraction. Thirdly, a preposition is from its nature a general word,\nwhich, from its very first institution, must have been considered as\nequally applicable to denote any other similar relation. The man who\nfirst invented the word _above_, must not only have distinguished, in\nsome measure, the relation of _superiority_ from the objects which were\nso related, but he must also have distinguished this relation from other\nrelations, such as, from the relation of _inferiority_ denoted by the\nword _below_, from the relation of _juxtaposition_, expressed by the\nword _beside_, and the like. He must have conceived this word,\ntherefore, as expressive of a particular sort or species of relation\ndistinct from every other, which could not be done without a\nconsiderable effort of comparison and generalization.\nWhatever were the difficulties, therefore, which embarrassed the first\ninvention of nouns adjective, the same, and many more, must have\nembarrassed that of prepositions. If mankind, therefore, in the first\nformation of languages, seem to have, for some time, evaded the\nnecessity of nouns adjective, by varying the termination of the names of\nsubstances, according as these varied in some of their most important\nqualities, they would much more find themselves under the necessity of\nevading, by some similar contrivance, the yet more difficult invention\nof prepositions. The different cases in the ancient languages is a\ncontrivance of precisely the same kind. The genitive and dative cases,\nin Greek and Latin, evidently supply the place of the prepositions; and\nby a variation in the noun substantive, which stands for the co-relative\nterm, express the relation which subsists between what is denoted by\nthat noun substantive, and what is expressed by some other word in the\nsentence. In these expressions, for example, _fructus arboris_, _the\nfruit of the tree_; _sacer Herculi_, _sacred to Hercules_; the\nvariations made in the co-relative words, _arbor_ and _Hercules_,\nexpress the same relations which are expressed in English by the\nprepositions _of_ and _to_.\nTo express a relation in this manner, did not require any effort of\nabstraction. It was not here expressed by a peculiar word denoting\nrelation and nothing but relation, but by a variation upon the\nco-relative term. It was expressed here, as it appears in nature, not as\nsomething separated and detached, but as thoroughly mixed and blended\nwith the co-relative object.\nTo express relation in this manner, did not require any effort of\ngeneralization. The words _arboris_ and _Herculi_, while they involve in\ntheir signification the same relation expressed by the English\nprepositions _of_ and _to_, are not, like those prepositions, general\nwords, which can be applied to express the same relation between\nwhatever other objects it might be observed to subsist.\nTo express relation in this manner did not require any effort of\ncomparison. The words _arboris_ and _Herculi_ are not general words\nintended to denote a particular species of relations which the inventors\nof those expressions meant, in consequence of some sort of comparison,\nto separate and distinguish from every other sort of relation. The\nexample, indeed, of this contrivance would soon probably be followed,\nand whoever had occasion to express a similar relation between any other\nobjects would be very apt to do it by making a similar variation on the\nname of the co-relative object. This, I say, would probably, or rather\ncertainly happen; but it would happen without any intention or foresight\nin those who first set the example, and who never meant to establish any\ngeneral rule. The general rule would establish itself insensibly, and by\nslow degrees, in consequence of that love of analogy and similarity of\nsound, which is the foundation of by far the greater part of the rules\nof grammar.\nTo express relation therefore, by a variation in the name of the\nco-relative object, requiring neither abstraction, nor generalization,\nnor comparison of any kind, would, at first, be much more natural and\neasy, than to express it by those general words called prepositions, of\nwhich the first invention must have demanded some degree of all those\noperations.\nThe number of cases is different in different languages. There are five\nin the Greek, six in the Latin, and there are said to be ten in the\nArmenian language. It must have naturally happened that there should be\na greater or a smaller number of cases, according as in the terminations\nof nouns substantive the first formers of any language happened to have\nestablished a greater or a smaller number of variations, in order to\nexpress the different relations they had occasion to take notice of,\nbefore the invention of those more general and abstract prepositions\nwhich could supply their place.\nIt is, perhaps, worth while to observe that those prepositions, which in\nmodern languages hold the place of the ancient cases, are, of all\nothers, the most general, and abstract, and metaphysical; and of\nconsequence, would probably be the last invented. Ask any man of common\nacuteness, What relation is expressed by the preposition _above_? He\nwill readily answer, that of _superiority_. By the preposition _below_?\nHe will as quickly reply, that of _inferiority_. But ask him, what\nrelation is expressed by the preposition _of_, and, if he has not\nbeforehand employed his thoughts a good deal upon these subjects, you\nmay safely allow him a week to consider of his answer. The prepositions\n_above_ and _below_ do not denote any of the relations expressed by the\ncases in the ancient languages. But the preposition _of_, denotes the\nsame relation, which is in them expressed by the genitive case; and\nwhich, it is easy to observe, is of a very metaphysical nature. The\npreposition of, denotes relation in general, considered in concrete with\nthe co-relative object. It marks that the noun substantive which goes\nbefore it, is somehow or other related to that which comes after it, but\nwithout in any respect ascertaining, as is done by the preposition\n_above_, what is the peculiar nature of that relation. We often apply\nit, therefore, to express the most opposite relations; because, the most\nopposite relations agree so far that each of them comprehends in it the\ngeneral idea or nature of a relation. We say, _the father of the son_,\nand _the son of the father_; _the fir-trees of the forest_, and the\n_forest of the fir-trees_. The relation in which the father stands to\nthe son, is, it is evident, a quite opposite relation to that in which\nthe son stands to the father; that in which the parts stand to the\nwhole, is quite opposite to that in which the whole stands to the parts.\nThe word _of_, however, serves very well to denote all those relations,\nbecause in itself it denotes no particular relation, but only relation\nin general; and so far as any particular relation is collected from such\nexpressions, it is inferred by the mind, not from the preposition\nitself, but from the nature and arrangement of the substantives, between\nwhich the preposition is placed.\nWhat I have said concerning the preposition _of_, may in some measure be\napplied to the prepositions, _to_, _for_, _with_, _by_, and to whatever\nother prepositions are made use of in modern languages, to supply the\nplace of the ancient cases. They all of them express very abstract and\nmetaphysical relations, which any man, who takes the trouble to try it,\nwill find it extremely difficult to express by nouns substantive, in the\nsame manner as we may express the relation denoted by the preposition\n_above_, by the noun substantive _superiority_. They all of them,\nhowever, express some specific relation, and are, consequently, none of\nthem so abstract as the preposition _of_, which may be regarded as by\nfar the most metaphysical of all prepositions. The prepositions\ntherefore, which are capable of supplying the place of the ancient\ncases, being more abstract than the other prepositions, would naturally\nbe of more difficult invention. The relations at the same time which\nthose prepositions express, are, of all others, those which we have most\nfrequent occasion to mention. The prepositions _above_, _below_, _near_,\n_within_, _without_, _against_, &c. are much more rarely made use of, in\nmodern languages, than the prepositions _of_, _to_, _for_, _with_,\n_from_, _by_. A preposition of the former kind will not occur twice in a\npage; we can scarce compose a single sentence without the assistance of\none or two of the latter. If these latter prepositions, therefore, which\nsupply the place of the cases, would be of such difficult invention on\naccount of their abstractedness, some expedient, to supply their place,\nmust have been of indispensable necessity, on account of the frequent\noccasion which men have to take notice of the relations which they\ndenote. But there is no expedient so obvious, as that of varying the\ntermination of one of the principal words.\nIt is, perhaps, unnecessary to observe, that there are some of the cases\nin the ancient languages, which, for particular reasons, cannot be\nrepresented by any prepositions. These are the nominative, accusative,\nand vocative cases. In those modern languages, which do not admit of any\nsuch variety in the terminations of their nouns substantive, the\ncorrespondent relations are expressed by the place of the words, and by\nthe order and construction of the sentence.\nAs men have frequently occasion to make mention of multitudes as well as\nof single objects, it became necessary that they should have some method\nof expressing number. Number may be expressed either by a particular\nword, expressing number in general, such as the words _many_, _more_,\n&c. or by some variation upon the words which express the things\nnumbered. It is this last expedient which mankind would probably have\nrecourse to, in the infancy of language. Number, considered in general,\nwithout relation to any particular set of objects numbered, is one of\nthe most abstract and metaphysical ideas, which the mind of man is\ncapable of forming; and, consequently, is not an idea, which would\nreadily occur to rude mortals, who were just beginning to form a\nlanguage. They would naturally, therefore, distinguish when they talked\nof a single, and when they talked of a multitude of objects, not by any\nmetaphysical adjectives, such as the English, _a_, _an_, _many_, but by\na variation upon the termination of the word which signified the objects\nnumbered. Hence the origin of the singular and plural numbers, in all\nthe ancient languages; and the same distinction has likewise been\nretained in all the modern languages, at least, in the greater part of\nwords.\nAll primitive and uncompounded languages seem to have a dual, as well as\na plural number. This is the case of the Greek, and I am told of the\nHebrew, of the Gothic, and of many other languages. In the rude\nbeginnings of society, _one_, _two_, and _more_, might possibly be all\nthe numeral distinctions which mankind would have any occasion to take\nnotice of. These they would find it more natural to express, by a\nvariation upon every particular noun substantive, than by such general\nand abstract words as _one_, _two_, _three_, _four_, &c. These words,\nthough custom has rendered them familiar to us, express, perhaps, the\nmost subtile and refined abstractions, which the mind of man is capable\nof forming. Let any one consider within himself, for example, what he\nmeans by the word _three_, which signifies neither three shillings, nor\nthree pence, nor three men, nor three horses, but three in general; and\nhe will easily satisfy himself that a word, which denotes so very\nmetaphysical an abstraction, could not be either a very obvious or a\nvery early invention. I have read of some savage nations, whose language\nwas capable of expressing no more than the three first numeral\ndistinctions. But whether it expressed those distinctions by three\ngeneral words, or by variations upon the nouns substantive, denoting the\nthings numbered, I do not remember to have met with any thing which\ncould determine.\nAs all the same relations which subsist between single, may likewise\nsubsist between numerous objects, it is evident there would be occasion\nfor the same number of cases in the dual and in the plural, as in the\nsingular number. Hence the intricacy and complexness of the declensions\nin all the ancient languages. In the Greek there are five cases in each\nof the three numbers, consequently fifteen in all.\nAs nouns adjective, in the ancient languages, varied their terminations\naccording to the gender of the substantive to which they were applied,\nso did they likewise, according to the case and the number. Every noun\nadjective in the Greek language, therefore, having three genders, and\nthree numbers, and five cases in each number, may be considered as\nhaving five and forty different variations. The first formers of\nlanguage seem to have varied the termination of the adjective, according\nto the case and the number of the substantive, for the same reason which\nmade them vary according to the gender; the love of analogy, and of a\ncertain regularity of sound. In the signification of adjectives there is\nneither case nor number, and the meaning of such words is always\nprecisely the same, notwithstanding all the variety of termination under\nwhich they appear. _Magnus vir_, _magni viri_, _magnorum virorum_; _a\ngreat man_, _of a great man_, _of great men_ in all these expressions\nthe words _magnus_, _magni_, _magnorum_, as well as the word _great_,\nhave precisely one and the same signification, though the substantives\nto which they are applied have not. The difference of termination in the\nnoun adjective is accompanied with no sort of difference in the meaning.\nAn adjective denotes the qualification of a noun substantive. But the\ndifferent relations in which that noun substantive may occasionally\nstand, can make no sort of difference upon its qualification.\nIf the declensions of the ancient languages are so very complex, their\nconjugations are infinitely more so. And the complexness of the one is\nfounded upon the same principle with that of the other, the difficulty\nof forming, in the beginnings of language, abstract and general terms.\nVerbs must necessarily have been coeval with the very first attempts\ntowards the formation of language. No affirmation can be expressed\nwithout the assistance of some verb. We never speak but in order to\nexpress our opinion that something either is or is not. But the word\ndenoting this event, or this matter of fact, which is the subject of our\naffirmation, must always be a verb.\nImpersonal verbs, which express in one word a complete event, which\npreserve in the expression that perfect simplicity and unity, which\nthere always is in the object and in the idea, and which suppose no\nabstraction, or metaphysical division of the event into its several\nconstituent members of subject and attribute, would, in all probability,\nbe the species of verbs first invented. The verbs _pluit_, _it rains_;\n_ningit_, _it snows_; _tonat_, _it thunders_; _lucet_, _it is day_;\n_turbatur_, _there is a confusion_, &c. each of them express a complete\naffirmation, the whole of an event, with that perfect simplicity and\nunity with which the mind conceives it in nature. On the contrary, the\nphrases, _Alexander ambulat_, _Alexander walks_; _Petrus sedet_, _Peter\nsits_, divide the event, as it were, into two parts, the person or\nsubject, and the attribute, or matter of fact, affirmed of that subject.\nBut in nature, the idea or conception of Alexander walking, is as\nperfectly and completely one single conception, as that of Alexander not\nwalking. The division of this event, therefore, into two parts, is\naltogether artificial, and is the effect of the imperfection of\nlanguage, which, upon this, as upon many other occasions, supplies, by a\nnumber of words, the want of one, which could express at once the whole\nmatter of fact that was meant to be affirmed. Every body must observe\nhow much more simplicity there is in the natural expression, _pluit_,\nthan in the more artificial expressions, _imber decidit_, _the rain\nfalls_; or, _tempestas est pluvia_, _the weather is rainy_. In these two\nlast expressions, the simple event, or matter of fact, is artificially\nsplit and divided, in the one, into two; in the other, into three parts.\nIn each of them it is expressed by a sort of grammatical circumlocution,\nof which the significancy is founded upon a certain metaphysical\nanalysis of the component parts of the idea expressed by the word\n_pluit_. The first verbs, therefore, perhaps even the first words, made\nuse of in the beginnings of language, would in all probability be such\nimpersonal verbs. It is observed accordingly, I am told, by the Hebrew\nGrammarians, that the radical words of their language, from which all\nthe others are derived, are all of them verbs, and impersonal verbs.\nIt is easy to conceive how, in the progress of language, those\nimpersonal verbs should become personal. Let us suppose, for example,\nthat the word _venit_, _it comes_, was originally an impersonal verb,\nand that it denoted, not the coming of something in general, as at\npresent, but the coming of a particular object, such as _the Lion_. The\nfirst savage inventors of language, we shall suppose, when they observed\nthe approach of this terrible animal, were accustomed to cry out to one\nanother, _venit_, that is, _the lion comes_; and that this word thus\nexpressed a complete event, without the assistance of any other.\nAfterwards, when, on the further progress of language, they had begun to\ngive names to particular substances, whenever they observed the approach\nof any other terrible object, they would naturally join the name of that\nobject to the word _venit_, and cry out, _venit ursus_, _venit lupus_.\nBy degrees the word _venit_ would thus come to signify the coming of any\nterrible object, and not merely the coming of the lion. It would now\ntherefore, express, not the coming of a particular object, but the\ncoming of an object of a particular kind. Having become more general in\nits signification, it could no longer represent any particular distinct\nevent by itself, and without the assistance of a noun substantive, which\nmight serve to ascertain and determine its signification. It would now,\ntherefore, have become a personal, instead of an impersonal verb. We may\neasily conceive how, in the further progress of society, it might still\ngrow more general in its signification, and come to signify, as at\npresent, the approach of any thing whatever, whether good, bad, or\nindifferent.\nIt is probably in some such manner as this, that almost all verbs have\nbecome personal, and that mankind have learned by degrees to split and\ndivide almost every event into a great number of metaphysical parts,\nexpressed by the different parts of speech, variously combined in the\ndifferent members of every phrase and sentence.[29] The same sort of\nprogress seems to have been made in the art of speaking as in the art of\nwriting. When mankind first began to attempt to express their ideas by\nwriting, every character represented a whole word. But the number of\nwords being almost infinite, the memory found itself quite loaded and\noppressed by the multitude of characters which it was obliged to retain.\nNecessity taught them, therefore, to divide words into their elements,\nand to invent characters which should represent, not the words\nthemselves, but the elements of which they were composed. In consequence\nof this invention, every particular word came to be represented, not by\none character, but by a multitude of characters; and the expression of\nit in writing became much more intricate and complex than before. But\nthough particular words were thus represented by a greater number of\ncharacters, the whole language was expressed by a much smaller, and\nabout four and twenty letters were found capable of supplying the place\nof that immense multitude of characters, which were requisite before. In\nthe same manner, in the beginnings of language, men seem to have\nattempted to express every particular event, which they had occasion to\ntake notice of, by a particular word, which expressed at once the whole\nof that event. But as the number of words must, in this case, have\nbecome really infinite, in consequence of the really infinite variety of\nevents, men found themselves partly compelled by necessity, and partly\nconducted by nature, to divide every event into what may be called its\nmetaphysical elements, and to institute words, which should denote not\nso much the events, as the elements of which they were composed. The\nexpression of every particular event, became in this manner more\nintricate and complex, but the whole system of the language became more\ncoherent, more connected, more easily retained and comprehended.\nFootnote 29:\nAs the far greater part of Verbs express, at present, not an event,\nbut the attribute of an event, and, consequently, require a subject,\nor nominative case, to complete their signification, some grammarians,\nnot having attended to this progress of nature, and being desirous to\nmake their common rules quite universal, and without any exception,\nhave insisted that all verbs required a nominative, either expressed\nor understood; and have, accordingly put themselves to the torture to\nfind some awkward nominatives to those few verbs, which still\nexpressing a complete event, plainly admit of none. _Pluit_, for\nexample, according to _Sanctius_, means _pluvia pluit_, in English,\n_the rain rains_. See Sanctii Minerva, l. 3. c. 1.\nWhen verbs, from being originally impersonal had thus, by the division\nof the event into its metaphysical elements, become personal, it is\nnatural to suppose that they would first be made use of in the third\nperson singular. No verb is ever used impersonally in our language, nor,\nso far as I know, in any other modern tongue. But in the ancient\nlanguages, whenever any verb is used impersonally, it is always in the\nthird person singular. The termination of those verbs, which are still\nalways impersonal, is constantly the same with that of the third person\nsingular of personal verbs. The consideration of these circumstances,\njoined to the naturalness of the thing itself, may serve to convince us\nthat verbs first became personal in what is now called the third person\nsingular.\nBut as the event, or matter of fact, which is expressed by a verb, may\nbe affirmed either of the person who speaks, or of the person who is\nspoken to, as well as of some third person or object, it became\nnecessary to fall upon some method of expressing these two peculiar\nrelations of the event. In the English language this is commonly done,\nby prefixing, what are called the personal pronouns, to the general word\nwhich expresses the event affirmed. _I came_, _you came_, _he_ or _it\ncame_; in these phrases the event of having come is, in the first,\naffirmed of the speaker; in the second, of the person spoken to; in the\nthird, of some other person, or object. The first formers of language,\nit may be imagined, might have done the same thing, and prefixing in the\nsame manner the two first personal pronouns, to the same termination of\nthe verb, which expressed the third person singular, might have said,\n_ego venit_, _tu venit_, as well as _ille_ or _illud venit_. And I make\nno doubt but they would have done so, if at the time when they had first\noccasion to express these relations of the verb, there had been any such\nwords as either _ego_ or _tu_ in their language. But in this early\nperiod of the language, which we are now endeavouring to describe, it is\nextremely improbable that any such words would be known. Though custom\nhas now rendered them familiar to us, they, both of them, express ideas\nextremely metaphysical and abstract. The word _I_, for example, is a\nword of a very particular species. Whatever speaks may denote itself by\nthis personal pronoun. The word _I_, therefore, is a general word,\ncapable of being predicated, as the logicians say, of an infinite\nvariety of objects. It differs, however, from all other general words in\nthis respect; that the objects of which it may be predicated, do not\nform any particular species of objects distinguished from all others.\nThe word _I_, does not, like the word _man_, denote a particular class\nof objects, separated from all others by peculiar qualities of their\nown. It is far from being the name of a species, but, on the contrary,\nwhenever it is made use of, it always denotes a precise individual, the\nparticular person who then speaks. It may be said to be, at once, both\nwhat the logicians call, a singular, and what they call, a common term;\nand to join in its signification the seemingly opposite qualities of the\nmost precise individuality, and the most extensive generalization. This\nword, therefore, expressing so very abstract and metaphysical an idea,\nwould not easily or readily occur to the first formers of language. What\nare called the personal pronouns, it may be observed, are among the last\nwords of which children learn to make use. A child, speaking of itself,\nsays, _Billy walks_, _Billy sits_, instead of _I walk_, _I sit_. As in\nthe beginnings of language, therefore, mankind seem to have evaded the\ninvention of at least the more abstract proportions, and to have\nexpressed the same relations which these _now_ stand for, by varying the\ntermination of the co-relative term, so they likewise would naturally\nattempt to evade the necessity of inventing those more abstract pronouns\nby varying the termination of the verb, according as the event which it\nexpressed was intended to be affirmed of the first, second, or third\nperson. This seems, accordingly, to be the universal practice of all the\nancient languages. In Latin, _veni_, _venisti_, _venit_, sufficiently\ndenote, without any other addition, the different events expressed by\nthe English phrases, _I came_, _you came_, he, or _it came_. The verb\nwould, for the same reason, vary its termination, according as the event\nwas intended to be affirmed of the first, second, or third persons\nplural; and what is expressed by the English phrases, _we came_, _ye\ncame_, _they came_, would be denoted by the Latin words, _venimus_,\n_venistis_, _venerunt_. Those primitive languages, too, which, upon\naccount of the difficulty of inventing numeral names, had introduced a\ndual, as well as a plural number, into the declension of their nouns\nsubstantive, would probably, from analogy, do the same thing in the\nconjugations of their verbs. And thus in all those original languages,\nwe might expect to find, at least six, if not eight or nine variations,\nin the termination of every verb, according as the event which it\ndenoted was meant to be affirmed of the first, second, or third persons\nsingular, dual, or plural. These variations again being repeated, along\nwith others, through all its different tenses, modes and voices, must\nnecessarily have rendered their conjugations still more intricate and\ncomplex than their declensions.\nLanguage would probably have continued upon this footing in all\ncountries, nor would ever have grown more simple in its declensions and\nconjugations, had it not become more complex in its composition, in\nconsequence of the mixture of several languages with one another,\noccasioned by the mixture of different nations. As long as any language\nwas spoke by those only who learned it in their infancy, the intricacy\nof its declensions and conjugations could occasion no great\nembarrassment. The far greater part of those who had occasion to speak\nit, had acquired it at so very early a period of their lives, so\ninsensibly and by such slow degrees, that they were scarce ever sensible\nof the difficulty. But when two nations came to be mixed with one\nanother, either by conquest or migration, the case would be very\ndifferent. Each nation, in order to make itself intelligible to those\nwith whom it was under the necessity of conversing, would be obliged to\nlearn the language of the other. The greater part of individuals too,\nlearning the new language, not by art, or by remounting to its rudiments\nand first principles, but by rote, and by what they commonly heard in\nconversation, would be extremely perplexed by the intricacy of its\ndeclensions and conjugations. They would endeavour, therefore, to supply\ntheir ignorance of these, by whatever shift the language could afford\nthem. Their ignorance of the declensions they would naturally supply by\nthe use of prepositions; and a Lombard, who was attempting to speak\nLatin, and wanted to express that such a person was a citizen of Rome,\nor a benefactor to Rome, if he happened not to be acquainted with the\ngenitive and dative cases of the word _Roma_, would naturally express\nhimself by prefixing the prepositions _ad_ and _de_ to the nominative;\nand, instead of _Rom\u00e6_, would say, _ad Roma_, and _de Roma_. _Al Roma_\nand _di Roma_, accordingly, is the manner in which the present Italians,\nthe descendants of the ancient Lombards and Romans, express this and all\nother similar relations. And in this manner prepositions seem to have\nbeen introduced, in the room of the ancient declensions. The same\nalteration has, I am informed, been produced upon the Greek language,\nsince the taking of Constantinople by the Turks. The words are, in a\ngreat measure, the same as before; but the grammar is entirely lost,\nprepositions having come in the place of the old declensions. This\nchange is undoubtedly a simplification of the language, in point of\nrudiments and principle. It introduces, instead of a great variety of\ndeclensions, one universal declension, which is the same in every word,\nof whatever gender, number, or termination.\nA similar expedient enables men, in the situation above-mentioned, to\nget rid of almost the whole intricacy of their conjugations. There is in\nevery language a verb, known by the name of the substantive verb; in\nLatin, _sum_; in English, _I am_. This verb denotes not the existence of\nany particular event, but existence in general. It is, upon this\naccount, the most abstract and metaphysical of all verbs; and,\nconsequently, could by no means be a a word of early invention. When it\ncame to be invented, however, as it had all the tenses and modes of any\nother verb, by being joined with the passive participle, it was capable\nof supplying the place of the whole passive voice, and of rendering this\npart of their conjugations as simple and uniform, as the use of\nprepositions had rendered their declensions. A Lombard, who wanted to\nsay, _I am loved_, but could not recollect the word _amor_, naturally\nendeavoured to supply his ignorance, by saying, _ego sum amatus_. _Io\nsono amato_, is at this day the Italian expression, which corresponds to\nthe English phrase above-mentioned.\nThere is another verb, which, in the same manner, runs through all\nlanguages, and which is distinguished by the name of the possessive\nverb; in Latin, _habeo_; in English, _I have_. This verb, likewise,\ndenotes an event of an extremely abstract and metaphysical nature, and,\nconsequently, cannot be supposed to have been a word of the earliest\ninvention. When it came to be invented, however, by being applied to the\npassive participle, it was capable of supplying a great part of the\nactive voice, as the substantive verb had supplied the whole of the\npassive. A Lombard, who wanted to say, _I had loved_, but could not\nrecollect the word _amaveram_, would endeavour to supply the place of\nit, by saying either _ego habebam amatum_, or _ego habui amatum_. _Io\navev\u00e1 amato_, or _Io ebbi amato_, are the correspondent Italian\nexpressions at this day. And thus upon the intermixture of different\nnations with one another, the conjugations, by means of different\nauxiliary verbs, were made to approach towards the simplicity and\nuniformity of the declensions.\nIn general it may be laid down for a maxim, that the more simple any\nlanguage is in its composition, the more complex it must be in its\ndeclensions and conjugations; and, on the contrary, the more simple it\nis in its declensions and conjugations, the more complex it must be in\nits composition.\nThe Greek seems to be, in a great measure, a simple, uncompounded\nlanguage, formed from the primitive jargon of those wandering savages,\nthe ancient Hellenians and Pelasgians, from whom the Greek nation is\nsaid to have been descended. All the words in the Greek language are\nderived from about three hundred primitives, a plain evidence that the\nGreeks formed their language almost entirely among themselves, and that\nwhen they had occasion for a new word, they were not accustomed, as we\nare, to borrow it from some foreign language, but to form it, either by\ncomposition or derivation from some other word or words, in their own.\nThe declensions and conjugations, therefore, of the Greek are much more\ncomplex than those of any other European language with which I am\nacquainted.\nThe Latin is a composition of the Greek and of the ancient Tuscan\nlanguages. Its declensions and conjugations accordingly are much less\ncomplex than those of the Greek: it has dropt the dual number in both.\nIts verbs have no optative mood distinguished by any peculiar\ntermination. They have but one future. They have no aorist distinct from\nthe preterit-perfect; they have no middle voice; and even many of their\ntenses in the passive voice are eked out, in the same manner as in the\nmodern languages, by the help of the substantive verb joined to the\npassive participle. In both the voices, the number of infinitives and\nparticiples is much smaller in the Latin than in the Greek.\nThe French and Italian languages are each of them compounded, the one of\nthe Latin, and the language of the ancient Franks, the other of the same\nLatin and the language of the ancient Lombards. As they are both of\nthem, therefore, more complex in their composition than the Latin, so\nare they likewise more simple in their declensions and conjugations.\nWith regard to their declensions, they have both of them lost their\ncases altogether; and with regard to their conjugations, they have both\nof them lost the whole of the passive, and some part of the active\nvoices of their verbs. The want of the passive voice they supply\nentirely by the substantive verb joined to the passive participle; and\nthey make out part of the active, in the same manner, by the help of the\npossessive verb and the same passive participle.\nThe English is compounded of the French and the ancient Saxon languages.\nThe French was introduced into Britain by the Norman conquest, and\ncontinued, till the time of Edward III. to be the sole language of the\nlaw as well as the principal language of the court. The English, which\ncame to be spoken afterwards, and which continues to be spoken now, is a\nmixture of the ancient Saxon and this Norman French. As the English\nlanguage, therefore, is more complex in its composition than either the\nFrench or the Italian, so is it likewise more simple in its declensions\nand conjugations. Those two languages retain, at least, a part of the\ndistinction of genders, and their adjectives vary their termination\naccording as they are applied to a masculine or to a feminine\nsubstantive. But there is no such distinction in the English language,\nwhose adjectives admit of no variety of termination. The French and\nItalian languages have, both of them, the remains of a conjugation, and\nall those tenses of the active voice, which cannot be expressed by the\npossessive verb joined to the passive participle, as well as many of\nthose which can, are, in those languages, marked by varying the\ntermination of the principal verb. But almost all those other tenses are\nin the English eked out by other auxiliary verbs, so that there is in\nthis language scarce even the remains of a conjugation. _I love_, _I\nloved_, _loving_, are all the varieties of termination which the greater\npart of English verbs admit of. All the different modifications of\nmeaning, which cannot be expressed by any of those three terminations,\nmust be made out by different auxiliary verbs joined to some one or\nother of them. Two auxiliary verbs supply all the deficiencies of the\nFrench and Italian conjugations; it requires more than half a dozen to\nsupply those of the English, which besides the substantive and\npossessive verbs, makes use of _do_, _did_; _will_, _would_; _shall_,\n_should_; _can_, _could_; _may_, _might_.\nIt is in this manner that language becomes more simple in its rudiments\nand principles, just in proportion as it grows more complex in its\ncomposition, and the same thing has happened in it, which commonly\nhappens with regard to mechanical engines. All machines are generally,\nwhen first invented, extremely complex in their principles, and there is\noften a particular principle of motion for every particular movement\nwhich, it is intended, they should perform. Succeeding improvers\nobserve, that one principle may be so applied as to produce several of\nthose movements, and thus the machine becomes gradually more and more\nsimple, and produces its effects with fewer wheels, and fewer principles\nof motion. In language, in the same manner, every case of every noun,\nand every tense of every verb, was originally expressed by a particular\ndistinct word, which served for this purpose and for no other. But\nsucceeding observation discovered that one set of words was capable of\nsupplying the place of all that infinite number, and that four or five\nprepositions, and half a dozen auxiliary verbs, were capable of\nanswering the end of all the declensions, and of all the conjugations in\nthe ancient languages.\nBut this simplification of languages, though it arises, perhaps, from\nsimilar causes, has by no means similar effects with the correspondent\nsimplification of machines. The simplification of machines renders them\nmore and more perfect, but this simplification of the rudiments of\nlanguages renders them more and more imperfect and less proper for many\nof the purposes of language: and this for the following reasons.\nFirst of all, languages are by this simplification rendered more prolix,\nseveral words having become necessary to express what could have been\nexpressed by a single word before. Thus the words, _Dei_ and, _Deo_, in\nthe Latin, sufficiently show, without any addition, what relation, the\nobject signified is understood to stand in to the objects expressed by\nthe other words in the sentence. But to express the same relation in\nEnglish, and in all other modern languages, we must make use of, at\nleast, two words, and say, _of God_, _to God_. So far as the declensions\nare concerned, therefore, the modern languages are much more prolix than\nthe ancient. The difference is still greater with regard to the\nconjugations. What a Roman expressed by the single word, _amavissem_, an\nEnglishman is obliged to express by four different words, _I should have\nloved_. It is unnecessary to take any pains to show how much this\nprolixness must enervate the eloquence of all modern languages. How much\nthe beauty of any expression depends upon its conciseness, is well known\nto those who have any experience in composition.\nSecondly, this simplification of the principles of languages renders\nthem less agreeable to the ear. The variety of termination in the Greek\nand Latin, occasioned by their declensions and conjugations, give a\nsweetness to their language altogether unknown to ours, and a variety\nunknown to any other modern language. In point of sweetness, the\nItalian, perhaps, may surpass the Latin, and almost equal the Greek; but\nin point of variety, it is greatly inferior to both.\nThirdly, this simplification, not only renders the sounds of our\nlanguage less agreeable to the ear, but it also restrains us from\ndisposing such sounds as we have, in the manner that might be most\nagreeable. It ties down many words to a particular situation, though\nthey might often be placed in another with much more beauty. In the\nGreek and Latin, though the adjective and substantive were separated\nfrom one another, the correspondence of their terminations still showed\ntheir mutual reference, and the separation did not necessarily occasion\nany sort of confusion. Thus in the first line of Virgil:\n_Tityre tu patul\u00e6 recubans sub tegmine fagi._\nWe easily see that _tu_ refers to _recubans_, and _patul\u00e6_ to _fagi_;\nthough the related words are separated from one another by the\nintervention of several others: because the terminations, showing the\ncorrespondence of their cases, determine their mutual reference. But if\nwe were to translate this line literally into English, and say,\n_Tityrus, thou of spreading reclining under the shade beech_, \u0152dipus\nhimself could not make sense of it; because there is here no difference\nof termination, to determine which substantive each adjective belongs\nto. It is the same case with regard to verbs. In Latin the verb may\noften be placed, without an inconveniency or ambiguity, in any part of\nthe sentence. But in English its place is almost always precisely\ndetermined. It must follow the subjective and precede the objective\nmember of the phrase in almost all cases. Thus in Latin whether you say,\n_Joannem verberavit Robertus_, or _Robertus verberavit Joannem_, the\nmeaning is precisely the same, and the termination fixes John to be the\nsufferer in both cases. But in English _John beat Robert_, and _Robert\nbeat John_, have by no means the same signification. The place therefore\nof the three principal members of the phrase is in the English, and for\nthe same reason in the French and Italian languages almost always\nprecisely determined; whereas in the ancient languages a greater\nlatitude is allowed, and the place of those members is often, in a great\nmeasure, indifferent. We must have recourse to Horace, in order to\ninterpret some parts of Milton\u2019s literal translation;\n_Who now enjoys thee credulous all gold,\nWho always vacant, always amiable\nHopes thee; of flattering gales\nUnmindful._\nare verses which it is impossible to interpret by any rules of our\nlanguage. There are no rules in our language, by which any man could\ndiscover, that, in the first line, _credulous_ referred to _who_, and\nnot to _thee_; or, that _all gold_ referred to any thing; or, that in\nthe fourth line, _unmindful_, referred to _who_, in the second, and not\nto _thee_ in the third; or, on the contrary, that, in the second line\n_always vacant, always amiable_, referred to _thee_ in the third, and\nnot to _who_ in the same line with it. In the Latin, indeed, all this is\nabundantly plain.\n_Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aure\u00e2,\nQui semper vacuam, semper amabilem\nSperat te; nescius aur\u00e6 fallacis._\nBecause the terminations in the Latin determine the reference of each\nadjective to its proper substantive, which it is impossible for any\nthing in the English to do. How much this power of transposing the order\nof their words must have facilitated the composition of the ancients,\nboth in verse and prose, can hardly be imagined. That it must greatly\nhave facilitated their versification it is needless to observe; and in\nprose, whatever beauty depends upon the arrangement and construction of\nthe several members of the period, must to them have been acquirable\nwith much more ease, and to much greater perfection, than it can be to\nthose whose expression is constantly confined by the prolixness,\nconstraint and monotony of modern languages.\nFINIS.\n[Illustration]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTRANSCRIBER\u2019S NOTES\n1.
