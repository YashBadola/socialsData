{"text": "The Categories\nBy\nAristotle\nTranslated by E. M. Edghill\nSection 1\nPart 1\nThings are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a\ncommon name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for\neach. Thus, a real man and a figure in a picture can both lay claim to\nthe name 'animal'; yet these are equivocally so named, for, though they\nhave a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs\nfor each. For should any one define in what sense each is an animal,\nhis definition in the one case will be appropriate to that case only.\nOn the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally' which have\nboth the name and the definition answering to the name in common. A man\nand an ox are both 'animal', and these are univocally so named,\ninasmuch as not only the name, but also the definition, is the same in\nboth cases: for if a man should state in what sense each is an animal,\nthe statement in the one case would be identical with that in the other.\nThings are said to be named 'derivatively', which derive their name\nfrom some other name, but differ from it in termination. Thus the\ngrammarian derives his name from the word 'grammar', and the courageous\nman from the word 'courage'.\nPart 2\nForms of speech are either simple or composite. Examples of the latter\nare such expressions as 'the man runs', 'the man wins'; of the former\n'man', 'ox', 'runs', 'wins'.\nOf things themselves some are predicable of a subject, and are never\npresent in a subject. Thus 'man' is predicable of the individual man,\nand is never present in a subject.\nBy being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are\npresent in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the\nsaid subject.\nSome things, again, are present in a subject, but are never predicable\nof a subject. For instance, a certain point of grammatical knowledge is\npresent in the mind, but is not predicable of any subject; or again, a\ncertain whiteness may be present in the body (for colour requires a\nmaterial basis), yet it is never predicable of anything.\nOther things, again, are both predicable of a subject and present in a\nsubject. Thus while knowledge is present in the human mind, it is\npredicable of grammar.\nThere is, lastly, a class of things which are neither present in a\nsubject nor predicable of a subject, such as the individual man or the\nindividual horse. But, to speak more generally, that which is\nindividual and has the character of a unit is never predicable of a\nsubject. Yet in some cases there is nothing to prevent such being\npresent in a subject. Thus a certain point of grammatical knowledge is\npresent in a subject.\nPart 3\nWhen one thing is predicated of another, all that which is predicable\nof the predicate will be predicable also of the subject. Thus, 'man' is\npredicated of the individual man; but 'animal' is predicated of 'man';\nit will, therefore, be predicable of the individual man also: for the\nindividual man is both 'man' and 'animal'.\nIf genera are different and co-ordinate, their differentiae are\nthemselves different in kind. Take as an instance the genus 'animal'\nand the genus 'knowledge'. 'With feet', 'two-footed', 'winged',\n'aquatic', are differentiae of 'animal'; the species of knowledge are\nnot distinguished by the same differentiae. One species of knowledge\ndoes not differ from another in being 'two-footed'.\nBut where one genus is subordinate to another, there is nothing to\nprevent their having the same differentiae: for the greater class is\npredicated of the lesser, so that all the differentiae of the predicate\nwill be differentiae also of the subject.\nPart 4\nExpressions which are in no way composite signify substance, quantity,\nquality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, or affection.\nTo sketch my meaning roughly, examples of substance are 'man' or 'the\nhorse', of quantity, such terms as 'two cubits long' or 'three cubits\nlong', of quality, such attributes as 'white', 'grammatical'. 'Double',\n'half', 'greater', fall under the category of relation; 'in the\nmarket place', 'in the Lyceum', under that of place; 'yesterday', 'last\nyear', under that of time. 'Lying', 'sitting', are terms indicating\nposition, 'shod', 'armed', state; 'to lance', 'to cauterize', action;\n'to be lanced', 'to be cauterized', affection.\nNo one of these terms, in and by itself, involves an affirmation; it is\nby the combination of such terms that positive or negative statements\narise. For every assertion must, as is admitted, be either true or\nfalse, whereas expressions which are not in any way composite such as\n'man', 'white', 'runs', 'wins', cannot be either true or false.\nPart 5\nSubstance, in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the\nword, is that which is neither predicable of a subject nor present in a\nsubject; for instance, the individual man or horse. But in a secondary\nsense those things are called substances within which, as species, the\nprimary substances are included; also those which, as genera, include\nthe species. For instance, the individual man is included in the\nspecies 'man', and the genus to which the species belongs is 'animal';\nthese, therefore--that is to say, the species 'man' and the genus\n'animal,-are termed secondary substances.\nIt is plain from what has been said that both the name and the\ndefinition of the predicate must be predicable of the subject. For\ninstance, 'man' is predicated of the individual man. Now in this case\nthe name of the species 'man' is applied to the individual, for we use\nthe term 'man' in describing the individual; and the definition of\n'man' will also be predicated of the individual man, for the individual\nman is both man and animal. Thus, both the name and the definition of\nthe species are predicable of the individual.\nWith regard, on the other hand, to those things which are present in a\nsubject, it is generally the case that neither their name nor their\ndefinition is predicable of that in which they are present. Though,\nhowever, the definition is never predicable, there is nothing in\ncertain cases to prevent the name being used. For instance, 'white'\nbeing present in a body is predicated of that in which it is present,\nfor a body is called white: the definition, however, of the colour\n'white' is never predicable of the body.\nEverything except primary substances is either predicable of a primary\nsubstance or present in a primary substance. This becomes evident by\nreference to particular instances which occur. 'Animal' is predicated\nof the species 'man', therefore of the individual man, for if there\nwere no individual man of whom it could be predicated, it could not be\npredicated of the species 'man' at all. Again, colour is present in\nbody, therefore in individual bodies, for if there were no individual\nbody in which it was present, it could not be present in body at all.\nThus everything except primary substances is either predicated of\nprimary substances, or is present in them, and if these last did not\nexist, it would be impossible for anything else to exist.\nOf secondary substances, the species is more truly substance than the\ngenus, being more nearly related to primary substance. For if any one\nshould render an account of what a primary substance is, he would\nrender a more instructive account, and one more proper to the subject,\nby stating the species than by stating the genus. Thus, he would give a\nmore instructive account of an individual man by stating that he was\nman than by stating that he was animal, for the former description is\npeculiar to the individual in a greater degree, while the latter is too\ngeneral. Again, the man who gives an account of the nature of an\nindividual tree will give a more instructive account by mentioning the\nspecies 'tree' than by mentioning the genus 'plant'.\nMoreover, primary substances are most properly called substances in\nvirtue of the fact that they are the entities which underlie everything\nelse, and that everything else is either predicated of them or present\nin them. Now the same relation which subsists between primary substance\nand everything else subsists also between the species and the genus:\nfor the species is to the genus as subject is to predicate, since the\ngenus is predicated of the species, whereas the species cannot be\npredicated of the genus. Thus we have a second ground for asserting\nthat the species is more truly substance than the genus.\nOf species themselves, except in the case of such as are genera, no one\nis more truly substance than another. We should not give a more\nappropriate account of the individual man by stating the species to\nwhich he belonged, than we should of an individual horse by adopting\nthe same method of definition. In the same way, of primary substances,\nno one is more truly substance than another; an individual man is not\nmore truly substance than an individual ox.\nIt is, then, with good reason that of all that remains, when we exclude\nprimary substances, we concede to species and genera alone the name\n'secondary substance', for these alone of all the predicates convey a\nknowledge of primary substance. For it is by stating the species or the\ngenus that we appropriately define any individual man; and we shall\nmake our definition more exact by stating the former than by stating\nthe latter. All other things that we state, such as that he is white,\nthat he runs, and so on, are irrelevant to the definition. Thus it is\njust that these alone, apart from primary substances, should be called\nsubstances.\nFurther, primary substances are most properly so called, because they\nunderlie and are the subjects of everything else. Now the same relation\nthat subsists between primary substance and everything else subsists\nalso between the species and the genus to which the primary substance\nbelongs, on the one hand, and every attribute which is not included\nwithin these, on the other. For these are the subjects of all such. If\nwe call an individual man 'skilled in grammar', the predicate is\napplicable also to the species and to the genus to which he belongs.\nThis law holds good in all cases.\nIt is a common characteristic of all substance that it is never present\nin a subject. For primary substance is neither present in a subject nor\npredicated of a subject; while, with regard to secondary substances, it\nis clear from the following arguments (apart from others) that they are\nnot present in a subject. For 'man' is predicated of the individual\nman, but is not present in any subject: for manhood is not present in\nthe individual man. In the same way, 'animal' is also predicated of the\nindividual man, but is not present in him. Again, when a thing is\npresent in a subject, though the name may quite well be applied to that\nin which it is present, the definition cannot be applied. Yet of\nsecondary substances, not only the name, but also the definition,\napplies to the subject: we should use both the definition of the\nspecies and that of the genus with reference to the individual man.\nThus substance cannot be present in a subject.\nYet this is not peculiar to substance, for it is also the case that\ndifferentiae cannot be present in subjects. The characteristics\n'terrestrial' and 'two-footed' are predicated of the species 'man', but\nnot present in it. For they are not in man. Moreover, the definition of\nthe differentia may be predicated of that of which the differentia\nitself is predicated. For instance, if the characteristic 'terrestrial'\nis predicated of the species 'man', the definition also of that\ncharacteristic may be used to form the predicate of the species 'man':\nfor 'man' is terrestrial.\nThe fact that the parts of substances appear to be present in the\nwhole, as in a subject, should not make us apprehensive lest we should\nhave to admit that such parts are not substances: for in explaining the\nphrase 'being present in a subject', we stated' that we meant\n'otherwise than as parts in a whole'.\nIt is the mark of substances and of differentiae that, in all\npropositions of which they form the predicate, they are predicated\nunivocally. For all such propositions have for their subject either the\nindividual or the species. It is true that, inasmuch as primary\nsubstance is not predicable of anything, it can never form the\npredicate of any proposition. But of secondary substances, the species\nis predicated of the individual, the genus both of the species and of\nthe individual. Similarly the differentiae are predicated of the\nspecies and of the individuals. Moreover, the definition of the species\nand that of the genus are applicable to the primary substance, and that\nof the genus to the species. For all that is predicated of the\npredicate will be predicated also of the subject. Similarly, the\ndefinition of the differentiae will be applicable to the species and to\nthe individuals. But it was stated above that the word 'univocal' was\napplied to those things which had both name and definition in common.\nIt is, therefore, established that in every proposition, of which\neither substance or a differentia forms the predicate, these are\npredicated univocally.\nAll substance appears to signify that which is individual. In the case\nof primary substance this is indisputably true, for the thing is a\nunit. In the case of secondary substances, when we speak, for instance,\nof 'man' or 'animal', our form of speech gives the impression that we\nare here also indicating that which is individual, but the impression\nis not strictly true; for a secondary substance is not an individual,\nbut a class with a certain qualification; for it is not one and single\nas a primary substance is; the words 'man', 'animal', are predicable of\nmore than one subject.\nYet species and genus do not merely indicate quality, like the term\n'white'; 'white' indicates quality and nothing further, but species and\ngenus determine the quality with reference to a substance: they signify\nsubstance qualitatively differentiated. The determinate qualification\ncovers a larger field in the case of the genus that in that of the\nspecies: he who uses the word 'animal' is herein using a word of wider\nextension than he who uses the word 'man'.\nAnother mark of substance is that it has no contrary. What could be the\ncontrary of any primary substance, such as the individual man or\nanimal? It has none. Nor can the species or the genus have a contrary.\nYet this characteristic is not peculiar to substance, but is true of\nmany other things, such as quantity. There is nothing that forms the\ncontrary of 'two cubits long' or of 'three cubits long', or of 'ten',\nor of any such term. A man may contend that 'much' is the contrary of\n'little', or 'great' of 'small', but of definite quantitative terms no\ncontrary exists.\nSubstance, again, does not appear to admit of variation of degree. I do\nnot mean by this that one substance cannot be more or less truly\nsubstance than another, for it has already been stated that this is\nthe case; but that no single substance admits of varying degrees within\nitself. For instance, one particular substance, 'man', cannot be more\nor less man either than himself at some other time or than some other\nman. One man cannot be more man than another, as that which is white\nmay be more or less white than some other white object, or as that\nwhich is beautiful may be more or less beautiful than some other\nbeautiful object. The same quality, moreover, is said to subsist in a\nthing in varying degrees at different times. A body, being white, is\nsaid to be whiter at one time than it was before, or, being warm, is\nsaid to be warmer or less warm than at some other time. But substance\nis not said to be more or less that which it is: a man is not more\ntruly a man at one time than he was before, nor is anything, if it is\nsubstance, more or less what it is. Substance, then, does not admit of\nvariation of degree.\nThe most distinctive mark of substance appears to be that, while\nremaining numerically one and the same, it is capable of admitting\ncontrary qualities. From among things other than substance, we should\nfind ourselves unable to bring forward any which possessed this mark.\nThus, one and the same colour cannot be white and black. Nor can the\nsame one action be good and bad: this law holds good with everything\nthat is not substance. But one and the selfsame substance, while\nretaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities.\nThe same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at\none time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This\ncapacity is found nowhere else, though it might be maintained that a\nstatement or opinion was an exception to the rule. The same statement,\nit is agreed, can be both true and false. For if the statement 'he is\nsitting' is true, yet, when the person in question has risen, the same\nstatement will be false. The same applies to opinions. For if any one\nthinks truly that a person is sitting, yet, when that person has risen,\nthis same opinion, if still held, will be false. Yet although this\nexception may be allowed, there is, nevertheless, a difference in the\nmanner in which the thing takes place. It is by themselves changing\nthat substances admit contrary qualities. It is thus that that which\nwas hot becomes cold, for it has entered into a different state.\nSimilarly that which was white becomes black, and that which was bad\ngood, by a process of change; and in the same way in all other cases it\nis by changing that substances are capable of admitting contrary\nqualities. But statements and opinions themselves remain unaltered in\nall respects: it is by the alteration in the facts of the case that the\ncontrary quality comes to be theirs. The statement 'he is sitting'\nremains unaltered, but it is at one time true, at another false,\naccording to circumstances. What has been said of statements applies\nalso to opinions. Thus, in respect of the manner in which the thing\ntakes place, it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be\ncapable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing\nthat it does so.\nIf, then, a man should make this exception and contend that statements\nand opinions are capable of admitting contrary qualities, his\ncontention is unsound. For statements and opinions are said to have\nthis capacity, not because they themselves undergo modification, but\nbecause this modification occurs in the case of something else. The\ntruth or falsity of a statement depends on facts, and not on any power\non the part of the statement itself of admitting contrary qualities. In\nshort, there is nothing which can alter the nature of statements and\nopinions. As, then, no change takes place in themselves, these cannot\nbe said to be capable of admitting contrary qualities.\nBut it is by reason of the modification which takes place within the\nsubstance itself that a substance is said to be capable of admitting\ncontrary qualities; for a substance admits within itself either disease\nor health, whiteness or blackness. It is in this sense that it is said\nto be capable of admitting contrary qualities.\nTo sum up, it is a distinctive mark of substance, that, while remaining\nnumerically one and the same, it is capable of admitting contrary\nqualities, the modification taking place through a change in the\nsubstance itself.\nLet these remarks suffice on the subject of substance.\nPart 6\nQuantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some quantities\nare such that each part of the whole has a relative position to the\nother parts: others have within them no such relation of part to part.\nInstances of discrete quantities are number and speech; of continuous,\nlines, surfaces, solids, and, besides these, time and place.\nIn the case of the parts of a number, there is no common boundary at\nwhich they join. For example: two fives make ten, but the two fives\nhave no common boundary, but are separate; the parts three and seven\nalso do not join at any boundary. Nor, to generalize, would it ever be\npossible in the case of number that there should be a common boundary\namong the parts; they are always separate. Number, therefore, is a\ndiscrete quantity.\nThe same is true of speech. That speech is a quantity is evident: for\nit is measured in long and short syllables. I mean here that speech\nwhich is vocal. Moreover, it is a discrete quantity for its parts have\nno common boundary. There is no common boundary at which the syllables\njoin, but each is separate and distinct from the rest.\nA line, on the other hand, is a continuous quantity, for it is possible\nto find a common boundary at which its parts join. In the case of the\nline, this common boundary is the point; in the case of the plane, it\nis the line: for the parts of the plane have also a common boundary.\nSimilarly you can find a common boundary in the case of the parts of a\nsolid, namely either a line or a plane.\nSpace and time also belong to this class of quantities. Time, past,\npresent, and future, forms a continuous whole. Space, likewise, is a\ncontinuous quantity; for the parts of a solid occupy a certain space,\nand these have a common boundary; it follows that the parts of space\nalso, which are occupied by the parts of the solid, have the same\ncommon boundary as the parts of the solid. Thus, not only time, but\nspace also, is a continuous quantity, for its parts have a common\nboundary.\nQuantities consist either of parts which bear a relative position each\nto each, or of parts which do not. The parts of a line bear a relative\nposition to each other, for each lies somewhere, and it would be\npossible to distinguish each, and to state the position of each on the\nplane and to explain to what sort of part among the rest each was\ncontiguous. Similarly the parts of a plane have position, for it could\nsimilarly be stated what was the position of each and what sort of\nparts were contiguous. The same is true with regard to the solid and to\nspace. But it would be impossible to show that the parts of a number had\na relative position each to each, or a particular position, or to state\nwhat parts were contiguous. Nor could this be done in the case of time,\nfor none of the parts of time has an abiding existence, and that which\ndoes not abide can hardly have position. It would be better to say that\nsuch parts had a relative order, in virtue of one being prior to\nanother. Similarly with number: in counting, 'one' is prior to 'two',\nand 'two' to 'three', and thus the parts of number may be said to\npossess a relative order, though it would be impossible to discover any\ndistinct position for each. This holds good also in the case of speech.\nNone of its parts has an abiding existence: when once a syllable is\npronounced, it is not possible to retain it, so that, naturally, as the\nparts do not abide, they cannot have position. Thus, some quantities\nconsist of parts which have position, and some of those which have not.\nStrictly speaking, only the things which I have mentioned belong to the\ncategory of quantity: everything else that is called quantitative is a\nquantity in a secondary sense. It is because we have in mind some one\nof these quantities, properly so called, that we apply quantitative\nterms to other things. We speak of what is white as large, because the\nsurface over which the white extends is large; we speak of an action or\na process as lengthy, because the time covered is long; these things\ncannot in their own right claim the quantitative epithet. For instance,\nshould any one explain how long an action was, his statement would be\nmade in terms of the time taken, to the effect that it lasted a year,\nor something of that sort. In the same way, he would explain the size\nof a white object in terms of surface, for he would state the area\nwhich it covered. Thus the things already mentioned, and these alone,\nare in their intrinsic nature quantities; nothing else can claim the\nname in its own right, but, if at all, only in a secondary sense.\nQuantities have no contraries. In the case of definite quantities this\nis obvious; thus, there is nothing that is the contrary of 'two cubits\nlong' or of 'three cubits long', or of a surface, or of any such\nquantities. A man might, indeed, argue that 'much' was the contrary of\n'little', and 'great' of 'small'. But these are not quantitative, but\nrelative; things are not great or small absolutely, they are so called\nrather as the result of an act of comparison. For instance, a mountain\nis called small, a grain large, in virtue of the fact that the latter\nis greater than others of its kind, the former less. Thus there is a\nreference here to an external standard, for if the terms 'great' and\n'small' were used absolutely, a mountain would never be called small or\na grain large. Again, we say that there are many people in a village,\nand few in Athens, although those in the city are many times as\nnumerous as those in the village: or we say that a house has many in\nit, and a theatre few, though those in the theatre far outnumber those\nin the house. The terms 'two cubits long', 'three cubits long', and so\non indicate quantity, the terms 'great' and 'small' indicate relation,\nfor they have reference to an external standard. It is, therefore,\nplain that these are to be classed as relative.\nAgain, whether we define them as quantitative or not, they have no\ncontraries: for how can there be a contrary of an attribute which is\nnot to be apprehended in or by itself, but only by reference to\nsomething external? Again, if 'great' and 'small' are contraries, it\nwill come about that the same subject can admit contrary qualities at\none and the same time, and that things will themselves be contrary to\nthemselves. For it happens at times that the same thing is both small\nand great. For the same thing may be small in comparison with one\nthing, and great in comparison with another, so that the same thing\ncomes to be both small and great at one and the same time, and is of\nsuch a nature as to admit contrary qualities at one and the same\nmoment. Yet it was agreed, when substance was being discussed, that\nnothing admits contrary qualities at one and the same moment. For\nthough substance is capable of admitting contrary qualities, yet no one\nis at the same time both sick and healthy, nothing is at the same time\nboth white and black. Nor is there anything which is qualified in\ncontrary ways at one and the same time.\nMoreover, if these were contraries, they would themselves be contrary\nto themselves. For if 'great' is the contrary of 'small', and the same\nthing is both great and small at the same time, then 'small' or 'great'\nis the contrary of itself. But this is impossible. The term 'great',\ntherefore, is not the contrary of the term 'small', nor 'much' of\n'little'. And even though a man should call these terms not relative\nbut quantitative, they would not have contraries.\nIt is in the case of space that quantity most plausibly appears to\nadmit of a contrary. For men define the term 'above' as the contrary of\n'below', when it is the region at the centre they mean by 'below'; and\nthis is so, because nothing is farther from the extremities of the\nuniverse than the region at the centre. Indeed, it seems that in\ndefining contraries of every kind men have recourse to a spatial\nmetaphor, for they say that those things are contraries which, within\nthe same class, are separated by the greatest possible distance.\nQuantity does not, it appears, admit of variation of degree. One thing\ncannot be two cubits long in a greater degree than another. Similarly\nwith regard to number: what is 'three' is not more truly three than\nwhat is 'five' is five; nor is one set of three more truly three than\nanother set. Again, one period of time is not said to be more truly\ntime than another. Nor is there any other kind of quantity, of all that\nhave been mentioned, with regard to which variation of degree can be\npredicated. The category of quantity, therefore, does not admit of\nvariation of degree.\nThe most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and inequality\nare predicated of it. Each of the aforesaid quantities is said to be\nequal or unequal. For instance, one solid is said to be equal or\nunequal to another; number, too, and time can have these terms applied\nto them, indeed can all those kinds of quantity that have been\nmentioned.\nThat which is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be termed\nequal or unequal to anything else. One particular disposition or one\nparticular quality, such as whiteness, is by no means compared with\nanother in terms of equality and inequality but rather in terms of\nsimilarity. Thus it is the distinctive mark of quantity that it can be\ncalled equal and unequal.\nSection 2\nPart 7\nThose things are called relative, which, being either said to be of\nsomething else or related to something else, are explained by reference\nto that other thing. For instance, the word 'superior' is explained by\nreference to something else, for it is superiority over something else\nthat is meant. Similarly, the expression 'double' has this external\nreference, for it is the double of something else that is meant. So it\nis with everything else of this kind. There are, moreover, other\nrelatives, e.g. habit, disposition, perception, knowledge, and\nattitude. The significance of all these is explained by a reference to\nsomething else and in no other way. Thus, a habit is a habit of\nsomething, knowledge is knowledge of something, attitude is the\nattitude of something. So it is with all other relatives that have been\nmentioned. Those terms, then, are called relative, the nature of which\nis explained by reference to something else, the preposition 'of' or\nsome other preposition being used to indicate the relation. Thus, one\nmountain is called great in comparison with another; for the\nmountain claims this attribute by comparison with something. Again,\nthat which is called similar must be similar to something else, and all\nother such attributes have this external reference. It is to be noted\nthat lying and standing and sitting are particular attitudes, but\nattitude is itself a relative term. To lie, to stand, to be seated, are\nnot themselves attitudes, but take their name from the aforesaid\nattitudes.\nIt is possible for relatives to have contraries. Thus virtue has a\ncontrary, vice, these both being relatives; knowledge, too, has a\ncontrary, ignorance. But this is not the mark of all relatives;\n'double' and 'triple' have no contrary, nor indeed has any such term.\nIt also appears that relatives can admit of variation of degree. For\n'like' and 'unlike', 'equal' and 'unequal', have the modifications\n'more' and 'less' applied to them, and each of these is relative in\ncharacter: for the terms 'like' and 'unequal' bear a\nreference to something external. Yet, again, it is not every relative\nterm that admits of variation of degree. No term such as 'double'\nadmits of this modification. All relatives have correlatives: by the\nterm 'slave' we mean the slave of a master, by the term 'master', the\nmaster of a slave; by 'double', the double of its half; by 'half', the\nhalf of its double; by 'greater', greater than that which is less; by\n'less', less than that which is greater.\nSo it is with every other relative term; but the case we use to express\nthe correlation differs in some instances. Thus, by knowledge we mean\nknowledge of the knowable; by the knowable, that which is to be\napprehended by knowledge; by perception, perception of the perceptible;\nby the perceptible, that which is apprehended by perception.\nSometimes, however, reciprocity of correlation does not appear to\nexist. This comes about when a blunder is made, and that to which the\nrelative is related is not accurately stated. If a man states that a\nwing is necessarily relative to a bird, the connexion between these two\nwill not be reciprocal, for it will not be possible to say that a bird\nis a bird by reason of its wings. The reason is that the original\nstatement was inaccurate, for the wing is not said to be relative to\nthe bird qua bird, since many creatures besides birds have wings, but\nqua winged creature. If, then, the statement is made accurate, the\nconnexion will be reciprocal, for we can speak of a wing, having\nreference necessarily to a winged creature, and of a winged creature as\nbeing such because of its wings.\nOccasionally, perhaps, it is necessary to coin words, if no word exists\nby which a correlation can adequately be explained. If we define a\nrudder as necessarily having reference to a boat, our definition will\nnot be appropriate, for the rudder does not have this reference to a\nboat qua boat, as there are boats which have no rudders. Thus we cannot\nuse the terms reciprocally, for the word 'boat' cannot be said to find\nits explanation in the word 'rudder'. As there is no existing word, our\ndefinition would perhaps be more accurate if we coined some word like\n'ruddered' as the correlative of 'rudder'. If we express ourselves thus\naccurately, at any rate the terms are reciprocally connected, for the\n'ruddered' thing is 'ruddered' in virtue of its rudder. So it is in all\nother cases. A head will be more accurately defined as the correlative\nof that which is 'headed', than as that of an animal, for the animal\ndoes not have a head qua animal, since many animals have no head.\nThus we may perhaps most easily comprehend that to which a thing is\nrelated, when a name does not exist, if, from that which has a name, we\nderive a new name, and apply it to that with which the first is\nreciprocally connected, as in the aforesaid instances, when we derived\nthe word 'winged' from 'wing' and from 'rudder'.\nAll relatives, then, if properly defined, have a correlative. I add\nthis condition because, if that to which they are related is stated as\nhaphazard and not accurately, the two are not found to be\ninterdependent. Let me state what I mean more clearly. Even in the case\nof acknowledged correlatives, and where names exist for each, there\nwill be no interdependence if one of the two is denoted, not by that\nname which expresses the correlative notion, but by one of irrelevant\nsignificance. The term 'slave', if defined as related, not to a master,\nbut to a man, or a biped, or anything of that sort, is not reciprocally\nconnected with that in relation to which it is defined, for the\nstatement is not exact. Further, if one thing is said to be correlative\nwith another, and the terminology used is correct, then, though all\nirrelevant attributes should be removed, and only that one attribute\nleft in virtue of which it was correctly stated to be correlative with\nthat other, the stated correlation will still exist. If the correlative\nof 'the slave' is said to be 'the master', then, though all irrelevant\nattributes of the said 'master', such as 'biped', 'receptive of\nknowledge', 'human', should be removed, and the attribute 'master'\nalone left, the stated correlation existing between him and the slave\nwill remain the same, for it is of a master that a slave is said to be\nthe slave. On the other hand, if, of two correlatives, one is not\ncorrectly termed, then, when all other attributes are removed and that\nalone is left in virtue of which it was stated to be correlative, the\nstated correlation will be found to have disappeared.\nFor suppose the correlative of 'the slave' should be said to be 'the\nman', or the correlative of 'the wing' is 'the bird'; if the attribute\n'master' be withdrawn from 'the man', the correlation between 'the man'\nand 'the slave' will cease to exist, for if the man is not a master,\nthe slave is not a slave. Similarly, if the attribute 'winged' be\nwithdrawn from 'the bird', 'the wing' will no longer be relative; for\nif the so-called correlative is not winged, it follows that 'the wing'\nhas no correlative.\nThus it is essential that the correlated terms should be exactly\ndesignated; if there is a name existing, the statement will be easy; if\nnot, it is doubtless our duty to construct names. When the terminology\nis thus correct, it is evident that all correlatives are interdependent.\nCorrelatives are thought to come into existence simultaneously. This is\nfor the most part true, as in the case of the double and the half. The\nexistence of the half necessitates the existence of that of which it is\na half. Similarly the existence of a master necessitates the existence\nof a slave, and that of a slave implies that of a master; these are\nmerely instances of a general rule. Moreover, they cancel one another;\nfor if there is no double it follows that there is no half, and vice\nversa; this rule also applies to all such correlatives. Yet it does not\nappear to be true in all cases that correlatives come into existence\nsimultaneously. The object of knowledge would appear to exist before\nknowledge itself, for it is usually the case that we acquire knowledge\nof objects already existing; it would be difficult, if not impossible,\nto find a branch of knowledge the beginning of the existence of which\nwas contemporaneous with that of its object.\nAgain, while the object of knowledge, if it ceases to exist, cancels at\nthe same time the knowledge which was its correlative, the converse of\nthis is not true. It is true that if the object of knowledge does not\nexist there can be no knowledge: for there will no longer be anything\nto know. Yet it is equally true that, if knowledge of a certain object\ndoes not exist, the object may nevertheless quite well exist. Thus, in\nthe case of the squaring of the circle, if indeed that process is an\nobject of knowledge, though it itself exists as an object of knowledge,\nyet the knowledge of it has not yet come into existence. Again, if all\nanimals ceased to exist, there would be no knowledge, but there might\nyet be many objects of knowledge.\nThis is likewise the case with regard to perception: for the object of\nperception is, it appears, prior to the act of perception. If the\nperceptible is annihilated, perception also will cease to exist; but\nthe annihilation of perception does not cancel the existence of the\nperceptible. For perception implies a body perceived and a body in\nwhich perception takes place. Now if that which is perceptible is\nannihilated, it follows that the body is annihilated, for the body is a\nperceptible thing; and if the body does not exist, it follows that\nperception also ceases to exist. Thus the annihilation of the\nperceptible involves that of perception.\nBut the annihilation of perception does not involve that of the\nperceptible. For if the animal is annihilated, it follows that\nperception also is annihilated, but perceptibles such as body, heat,\nsweetness, bitterness, and so on, will remain.\nAgain, perception is generated at the same time as the perceiving\nsubject, for it comes into existence at the same time as the animal.\nBut the perceptible surely exists before perception; for fire and water\nand such elements, out of which the animal is itself composed, exist\nbefore the animal is an animal at all, and before perception. Thus it\nwould seem that the perceptible exists before perception.\nIt may be questioned whether it is true that no substance is relative,\nas seems to be the case, or whether exception is to be made in the case\nof certain secondary substances. With regard to primary substances, it\nis quite true that there is no such possibility, for neither wholes nor\nparts of primary substances are relative. The individual man or ox is\nnot defined with reference to something external. Similarly with the\nparts: a particular hand or head is not defined as a particular hand or\nhead of a particular person, but as the hand or head of a particular\nperson. It is true also, for the most part at least, in the case of\nsecondary substances; the species 'man' and the species 'ox' are not\ndefined with reference to anything outside themselves. Wood, again, is\nonly relative in so far as it is some one's property, not in so far as\nit is wood. It is plain, then, that in the cases mentioned substance is\nnot relative. But with regard to some secondary substances there is a\ndifference of opinion; thus, such terms as 'head' and 'hand' are\ndefined with reference to that of which the things indicated are a\npart, and so it comes about that these appear to have a relative\ncharacter. Indeed, if our definition of that which is relative was\ncomplete, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove that no\nsubstance is relative. If, however, our definition was not complete, if\nthose things only are properly called relative in the case of which\nrelation to an external object is a necessary condition of existence,\nperhaps some explanation of the dilemma may be found.\nThe former definition does indeed apply to all relatives, but the fact\nthat a thing is explained with reference to something else does not\nmake it essentially relative.\nFrom this it is plain that, if a man definitely apprehends a relative\nthing, he will also definitely apprehend that to which it is relative.\nIndeed this is self-evident: for if a man knows that some particular\nthing is relative, assuming that we call that a relative in the case of\nwhich relation to something is a necessary condition of existence, he\nknows that also to which it is related. For if he does not know at all\nthat to which it is related, he will not know whether or not it is\nrelative. This is clear, moreover, in particular instances. If a man\nknows definitely that such and such a thing is 'double', he will also\nforthwith know definitely that of which it is the double. For if there\nis nothing definite of which he knows it to be the double, he does not\nknow at all that it is double. Again, if he knows that a thing is more\nbeautiful, it follows necessarily that he will forthwith definitely\nknow that also than which it is more beautiful. He will not merely know\nindefinitely that it is more beautiful than something which is less\nbeautiful, for this would be supposition, not knowledge. For if he does\nnot know definitely that than which it is more beautiful, he can no\nlonger claim to know definitely that it is more beautiful than\nsomething else which is less beautiful: for it might be that nothing\nwas less beautiful. It is, therefore, evident that if a man apprehends\nsome relative thing definitely, he necessarily knows that also\ndefinitely to which it is related.\nNow the head, the hand, and such things are substances, and it is\npossible to know their essential character definitely, but it does not\nnecessarily follow that we should know that to which they are related.\nIt is not possible to know forthwith whose head or hand is meant. Thus\nthese are not relatives, and, this being the case, it would be true to\nsay that no substance is relative in character. It is perhaps a\ndifficult matter, in such cases, to make a positive statement without\nmore exhaustive examination, but to have raised questions with regard\nto details is not without advantage.\nPart 8\nBy 'quality' I mean that in virtue of which people are said to be such\nand such.\nQuality is a term that is used in many senses. One sort of quality let\nus call 'habit' or 'disposition'. Habit differs from disposition in\nbeing more lasting and more firmly established. The various kinds of\nknowledge and of virtue are habits, for knowledge, even when acquired\nonly in a moderate degree, is, it is agreed, abiding in its character\nand difficult to displace, unless some great mental upheaval takes\nplace, through disease or any such cause. The virtues, also, such as\njustice, self-restraint, and so on, are not easily dislodged or\ndismissed, so as to give place to vice.\nBy a disposition, on the other hand, we mean a condition that is easily\nchanged and quickly gives place to its opposite. Thus, heat, cold,\ndisease, health, and so on are dispositions. For a man is disposed in\none way or another with reference to these, but quickly changes,\nbecoming cold instead of warm, ill instead of well. So it is with all\nother dispositions also, unless through lapse of time a disposition has\nitself become inveterate and almost impossible to dislodge: in which\ncase we should perhaps go so far as to call it a habit.\nIt is evident that men incline to call those conditions habits which\nare of a more or less permanent type and difficult to displace; for\nthose who are not retentive of knowledge, but volatile, are not said to\nhave such and such a 'habit' as regards knowledge, yet they are\ndisposed, we may say, either better or worse, towards knowledge. Thus\nhabit differs from disposition in this, that while the latter in\nephemeral, the former is permanent and difficult to alter.\nHabits are at the same time dispositions, but dispositions are not\nnecessarily habits. For those who have some specific habit may be said\nalso, in virtue of that habit, to be thus or thus disposed; but those\nwho are disposed in some specific way have not in all cases the\ncorresponding habit.\nAnother sort of quality is that in virtue of which, for example, we\ncall men good boxers or runners, or healthy or sickly: in fact it\nincludes all those terms which refer to inborn capacity or incapacity.\nSuch things are not predicated of a person in virtue of his\ndisposition, but in virtue of his inborn capacity or incapacity to do\nsomething with ease or to avoid defeat of any kind. Persons are called\ngood boxers or good runners, not in virtue of such and such a\ndisposition, but in virtue of an inborn capacity to accomplish\nsomething with ease. Men are called healthy in virtue of the inborn\ncapacity of easy resistance to those unhealthy influences that may\nordinarily arise; unhealthy, in virtue of the lack of this capacity.\nSimilarly with regard to softness and hardness. Hardness is predicated\nof a thing because it has that capacity of resistance which enables it\nto withstand disintegration; softness, again, is predicated of a thing\nby reason of the lack of that capacity.\nA third class within this category is that of affective qualities and\naffections. Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, are examples of this sort\nof quality, together with all that is akin to these; heat, moreover,\nand cold, whiteness, and blackness are affective qualities. It is\nevident that these are qualities, for those things that possess them\nare themselves said to be such and such by reason of their presence.\nHoney is called sweet because it contains sweetness; the body is called\nwhite because it contains whiteness; and so in all other cases.\nThe term 'affective quality' is not used as indicating that those\nthings which admit these qualities are affected in any way. Honey is\nnot called sweet because it is affected in a specific way, nor is this\nwhat is meant in any other instance. Similarly heat and cold are called\naffective qualities, not because those things which admit them are\naffected. What is meant is that these said qualities are capable of\nproducing an 'affection' in the way of perception. For sweetness has\nthe power of affecting the sense of taste; heat, that of touch; and so\nit is with the rest of these qualities.\nWhiteness and blackness, however, and the other colours, are not said\nto be affective qualities in this sense, but because they themselves\nare the results of an affection. It is plain that many changes of\ncolour take place because of affections. When a man is ashamed, he\nblushes; when he is afraid, he becomes pale, and so on. So true is\nthis, that when a man is by nature liable to such affections, arising\nfrom some concomitance of elements in his constitution, it is a\nprobable inference that he has the corresponding complexion of skin.\nFor the same disposition of bodily elements, which in the former\ninstance was momentarily present in the case of an access of shame,\nmight be a result of a man's natural temperament, so as to produce the\ncorresponding colouring also as a natural characteristic. All\nconditions, therefore, of this kind, if caused by certain permanent and\nlasting affections, are called affective qualities. For pallor and\nduskiness of complexion are called qualities, inasmuch as we are said\nto be such and such in virtue of them, not only if they originate in\nnatural constitution, but also if they come about through long disease\nor sunburn, and are difficult to remove, or indeed remain throughout\nlife. For in the same way we are said to be such and such because of\nthese.\nThose conditions, however, which arise from causes which may easily be\nrendered ineffective or speedily removed, are called, not qualities,\nbut affections: for we are not said to be such in virtue of them. The man\nwho blushes through shame is not said to be a constitutional blusher,\nnor is the man who becomes pale through fear said to be\nconstitutionally pale. He is said rather to have been affected.\nThus such conditions are called affections, not qualities. In like\nmanner there are affective qualities and affections of the soul. That\ntemper with which a man is born and which has its origin in certain\ndeep-seated affections is called a quality. I mean such conditions as\ninsanity, irascibility, and so on: for people are said to be mad or\nirascible in virtue of these. Similarly those abnormal psychic states\nwhich are not inborn, but arise from the concomitance of certain other\nelements, and are difficult to remove, or altogether permanent, are\ncalled qualities, for in virtue of them men are said to be such and\nsuch.\nThose, however, which arise from causes easily rendered ineffective are\ncalled affections, not qualities. Suppose that a man is irritable when\nvexed: he is not even spoken of as a bad-tempered man, when in such\ncircumstances he loses his temper somewhat, but rather is said to be\naffected. Such conditions are therefore termed, not qualities, but\naffections.\nThe fourth sort of quality is figure and the shape that belongs to a\nthing; and besides this, straightness and curvedness and any other\nqualities of this type; each of these defines a thing as being such and\nsuch. Because it is triangular or quadrangular a thing is said to have\na specific character, or again because it is straight or curved; in\nfact a thing's shape in every case gives rise to a qualification of it.\nRarity and density, roughness and smoothness, seem to be terms\nindicating quality: yet these, it would appear, really belong to a\nclass different from that of quality. For it is rather a certain\nrelative position of the parts composing the thing thus qualified\nwhich, it appears, is indicated by each of these terms. A thing is\ndense, owing to the fact that its parts are closely combined with one\nanother; rare, because there are interstices between the parts; smooth,\nbecause its parts lie, so to speak, evenly; rough, because some parts\nproject beyond others.\nThere may be other sorts of quality, but those that are most properly\nso called have, we may safely say, been enumerated.\nThese, then, are qualities, and the things that take their name from\nthem as derivatives, or are in some other way dependent on them, are\nsaid to be qualified in some specific way. In most, indeed in almost\nall cases, the name of that which is qualified is derived from that of\nthe quality. Thus the terms 'whiteness', 'grammar', 'justice', give us\nthe adjectives 'white', 'grammatical', 'just', and so on.\nThere are some cases, however, in which, as the quality under\nconsideration has no name, it is impossible that those possessed of it\nshould have a name that is derivative. For instance, the name given to\nthe runner or boxer, who is so called in virtue of an inborn capacity,\nis not derived from that of any quality; for both those capacities have\nno name assigned to them. In this, the inborn capacity is distinct from\nthe science, with reference to which men are called, e.g. boxers or\nwrestlers. Such a science is classed as a disposition; it has a name,\nand is called 'boxing' or 'wrestling' as the case may be, and the name\ngiven to those disposed in this way is derived from that of the\nscience. Sometimes, even though a name exists for the quality, that\nwhich takes its character from the quality has a name that is not a\nderivative. For instance, the upright man takes his character from the\npossession of the quality of integrity, but the name given him is not\nderived from the word 'integrity'. Yet this does not occur often.\nWe may therefore state that those things are said to be possessed of\nsome specific quality which have a name derived from that of the\naforesaid quality, or which are in some other way dependent on it.\nOne quality may be the contrary of another; thus justice is the\ncontrary of injustice, whiteness of blackness, and so on. The things,\nalso, which are said to be such and such in virtue of these qualities,\nmay be contrary the one to the other; for that which is unjust is\ncontrary to that which is just, that which is white to that which is\nblack. This, however, is not always the case. Red, yellow, and such\ncolours, though qualities, have no contraries.\nIf one of two contraries is a quality, the other will also be a\nquality. This will be evident from particular instances, if we apply\nthe names used to denote the other categories; for instance, granted\nthat justice is the contrary of injustice and justice is a quality,\ninjustice will also be a quality: neither quantity, nor relation, nor\nplace, nor indeed any other category but that of quality, will be\napplicable properly to injustice. So it is with all other contraries\nfalling under the category of quality.\nQualities admit of variation of degree. Whiteness is predicated of one\nthing in a greater or less degree than of another. This is also the\ncase with reference to justice. Moreover, one and the same thing may\nexhibit a quality in a greater degree than it did before: if a thing is\nwhite, it may become whiter.\nThough this is generally the case, there are exceptions. For if we\nshould say that justice admitted of variation of degree, difficulties\nmight ensue, and this is true with regard to all those qualities which\nare dispositions. There are some, indeed, who dispute the possibility\nof variation here. They maintain that justice and health cannot very\nwell admit of variation of degree themselves, but that people vary in\nthe degree in which they possess these qualities, and that this is the\ncase with grammatical learning and all those qualities which are\nclassed as dispositions. However that may be, it is an incontrovertible\nfact that the things which in virtue of these qualities are said to be\nwhat they are vary in the degree in which they possess them; for one\nman is said to be better versed in grammar, or more healthy or just,\nthan another, and so on.\nThe qualities expressed by the terms 'triangular' and 'quadrangular' do\nnot appear to admit of variation of degree, nor indeed do any that have\nto do with figure. For those things to which the definition of the\ntriangle or circle is applicable are all equally triangular or\ncircular. Those, on the other hand, to which the same definition is not\napplicable, cannot be said to differ from one another in degree; the\nsquare is no more a circle than the rectangle, for to neither is the\ndefinition of the circle appropriate. In short, if the definition of\nthe term proposed is not applicable to both objects, they cannot be\ncompared. Thus it is not all qualities which admit of variation of\ndegree.\nWhereas none of the characteristics I have mentioned are peculiar to\nquality, the fact that likeness and unlikeness can be predicated with\nreference to quality only, gives to that category its distinctive\nfeature. One thing is like another only with reference to that in\nvirtue of which it is such and such; thus this forms the peculiar mark\nof quality.\nWe must not be disturbed because it may be argued that, though\nproposing to discuss the category of quality, we have included in it\nmany relative terms. We did say that habits and dispositions were\nrelative. In practically all such cases the genus is relative, the\nindividual not. Thus knowledge, as a genus, is explained by reference\nto something else, for we mean a knowledge of something. But particular\nbranches of knowledge are not thus explained. The knowledge of grammar\nis not relative to anything external, nor is the knowledge of music,\nbut these, if relative at all, are relative only in virtue of their\ngenera; thus grammar is said be the knowledge of something, not the\ngrammar of something; similarly music is the knowledge of something,\nnot the music of something.\nThus individual branches of knowledge are not relative. And it is\nbecause we possess these individual branches of knowledge that we are\nsaid to be such and such. It is these that we actually possess: we are\ncalled experts because we possess knowledge in some particular branch.\nThose particular branches, therefore, of knowledge, in virtue of which\nwe are sometimes said to be such and such, are themselves qualities,\nand are not relative. Further, if anything should happen to fall within\nboth the category of quality and that of relation, there would be\nnothing extraordinary in classing it under both these heads.\nSection 3\nPart 9\nAction and affection both admit of contraries and also of variation of\ndegree. Heating is the contrary of cooling, being heated of being\ncooled, being glad of being vexed. Thus they admit of contraries. They\nalso admit of variation of degree: for it is possible to heat in a\ngreater or less degree; also to be heated in a greater or less degree.\nThus action and affection also admit of variation of degree. So much,\nthen, is stated with regard to these categories.\nWe spoke, moreover, of the category of position when we were dealing\nwith that of relation, and stated that such terms derived their names\nfrom those of the corresponding attitudes.\nAs for the rest, time, place, state, since they are easily\nintelligible, I say no more about them than was said at the beginning,\nthat in the category of state are included such states as 'shod',\n'armed', in that of place 'in the Lyceum' and so on, as was explained\nbefore.\nPart 10\nThe proposed categories have, then, been adequately dealt with. We must\nnext explain the various senses in which the term 'opposite' is used.\nThings are said to be opposed in four senses: (i) as correlatives to\none another, (ii) as contraries to one another, (iii) as privatives to\npositives, (iv) as affirmatives to negatives.\nLet me sketch my meaning in outline. An instance of the use of the word\n'opposite' with reference to correlatives is afforded by the\nexpressions 'double' and 'half'; with reference to contraries by 'bad'\nand 'good'. Opposites in the sense of 'privatives' and 'positives' are\n'blindness' and 'sight'; in the sense of affirmatives and negatives, the\npropositions 'he sits', 'he does not sit'.\n(i) Pairs of opposites which fall under the category of relation are\nexplained by a reference of the one to the other, the reference being\nindicated by the preposition 'of' or by some other preposition. Thus,\ndouble is a relative term, for that which is double is explained as the\ndouble of something. Knowledge, again, is the opposite of the thing\nknown, in the same sense; and the thing known also is explained by its\nrelation to its opposite, knowledge. For the thing known is explained\nas that which is known by something, that is, by knowledge. Such\nthings, then, as are opposite the one to the other in the sense of\nbeing correlatives are explained by a reference of the one to the other.\n(ii) Pairs of opposites which are contraries are not in any way\ninterdependent, but are contrary the one to the other. The good is not\nspoken of as the good of the bad, but as the contrary of the bad, nor\nis white spoken of as the white of the black, but as the contrary of\nthe black. These two types of opposition are therefore distinct. Those\ncontraries which are such that the subjects in which they are naturally\npresent, or of which they are predicated, must necessarily contain\neither the one or the other of them, have no intermediate, but those in\nthe case of which no such necessity obtains, always have an\nintermediate. Thus disease and health are naturally present in the body\nof an animal, and it is necessary that either the one or the other\nshould be present in the body of an animal. Odd and even, again, are\npredicated of number, and it is necessary that the one or the other\nshould be present in numbers. Now there is no intermediate between the\nterms of either of these two pairs. On the other hand, in those\ncontraries with regard to which no such necessity obtains, we find an\nintermediate. Blackness and whiteness are naturally present in the\nbody, but it is not necessary that either the one or the other should\nbe present in the body, inasmuch as it is not true to say that\neverybody must be white or black. Badness and goodness, again, are\npredicated of man, and of many other things, but it is not necessary\nthat either the one quality or the other should be present in that of\nwhich they are predicated: it is not true to say that everything that\nmay be good or bad must be either good or bad. These pairs of\ncontraries have intermediates: the intermediates between white and\nblack are grey, sallow, and all the other colours that come between;\nthe intermediate between good and bad is that which is neither the one\nnor the other.\nSome intermediate qualities have names, such as grey and sallow and all\nthe other colours that come between white and black; in other cases,\nhowever, it is not easy to name the intermediate, but we must define it\nas that which is not either extreme, as in the case of that which is\nneither good nor bad, neither just nor unjust.\n(iii) 'privatives' and 'positives' have reference to the same subject.\nThus, sight and blindness have reference to the eye. It is a universal\nrule that each of a pair of opposites of this type has reference to\nthat to which the particular 'positive' is natural. We say that that is\ncapable of some particular faculty or possession has suffered privation\nwhen the faculty or possession in question is in no way present in that\nin which, and at the time at which, it should naturally be present. We\ndo not call that toothless which has not teeth, or that blind which has\nnot sight, but rather that which has not teeth or sight at the time\nwhen by nature it should. For there are some creatures which from birth\nare without sight, or without teeth, but these are not called toothless\nor blind.\nTo be without some faculty or to possess it is not the same as the\ncorresponding 'privative' or 'positive'. 'Sight' is a 'positive',\n'blindness' a 'privative', but 'to possess sight' is not equivalent to\n'sight', 'to be blind' is not equivalent to 'blindness'. Blindness is a\n'privative', to be blind is to be in a state of privation, but is not a\n'privative'. Moreover, if 'blindness' were equivalent to 'being blind',\nboth would be predicated of the same subject; but though a man is said\nto be blind, he is by no means said to be blindness.\nTo be in a state of 'possession' is, it appears, the opposite of being\nin a state of 'privation', just as 'positives' and 'privatives'\nthemselves are opposite. There is the same type of antithesis in both\ncases; for just as blindness is opposed to sight, so is being blind\nopposed to having sight.\nThat which is affirmed or denied is not itself affirmation or denial.\nBy 'affirmation' we mean an affirmative proposition, by 'denial' a\nnegative. Now, those facts which form the matter of the affirmation or\ndenial are not propositions; yet these two are said to be opposed in\nthe same sense as the affirmation and denial, for in this case also the\ntype of antithesis is the same. For as the affirmation is opposed to\nthe denial, as in the two propositions 'he sits', 'he does not sit', so\nalso the fact which constitutes the matter of the proposition in one\ncase is opposed to that in the other, his sitting, that is to say, to\nhis not sitting.\nIt is evident that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each to\neach in the same sense as relatives. The one is not explained by\nreference to the other; sight is not sight of blindness, nor is any\nother preposition used to indicate the relation. Similarly blindness is\nnot said to be blindness of sight, but rather, privation of sight.\nRelatives, moreover, reciprocate; if blindness, therefore, were a\nrelative, there would be a reciprocity of relation between it and that\nwith which it was correlative. But this is not the case. Sight is not\ncalled the sight of blindness.\nThat those terms which fall under the heads of 'positives' and\n'privatives' are not opposed each to each as contraries, either, is\nplain from the following facts: Of a pair of contraries such that they\nhave no intermediate, one or the other must needs be present in the\nsubject in which they naturally subsist, or of which they are\npredicated; for it is those, as we proved, in the case of which this\nnecessity obtains, that have no intermediate. Moreover, we cited health\nand disease, odd and even, as instances. But those contraries which\nhave an intermediate are not subject to any such necessity. It is not\nnecessary that every substance, receptive of such qualities, should be\neither black or white, cold or hot, for something intermediate between\nthese contraries may very well be present in the subject. We proved,\nmoreover, that those contraries have an intermediate in the case of\nwhich the said necessity does not obtain. Yet when one of the two\ncontraries is a constitutive property of the subject, as it is a\nconstitutive property of fire to be hot, of snow to be white, it is\nnecessary determinately that one of the two contraries, not one or the\nother, should be present in the subject; for fire cannot be cold, or\nsnow black. Thus, it is not the case here that one of the two must\nneeds be present in every subject receptive of these qualities, but\nonly in that subject of which the one forms a constitutive property.\nMoreover, in such cases it is one member of the pair determinately, and\nnot either the one or the other, which must be present.\nIn the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', on the other hand, neither\nof the aforesaid statements holds good. For it is not necessary that a\nsubject receptive of the qualities should always have either the one or\nthe other; that which has not yet advanced to the state when sight is\nnatural is not said either to be blind or to see. Thus 'positives' and\n'privatives' do not belong to that class of contraries which consists\nof those which have no intermediate. On the other hand, they do not\nbelong either to that class which consists of contraries which have an\nintermediate. For under certain conditions it is necessary that either\nthe one or the other should form part of the constitution of every\nappropriate subject. For when a thing has reached the stage when it is\nby nature capable of sight, it will be said either to see or to be\nblind, and that in an indeterminate sense, signifying that the capacity\nmay be either present or absent; for it is not necessary either that it\nshould see or that it should be blind, but that it should be either in\nthe one state or in the other. Yet in the case of those contraries\nwhich have an intermediate we found that it was never necessary that\neither the one or the other should be present in every appropriate\nsubject, but only that in certain subjects one of the pair should be\npresent, and that in a determinate sense. It is, therefore, plain that\n'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each to each in either of\nthe senses in which contraries are opposed.\nAgain, in the case of contraries, it is possible that there should be\nchanges from either into the other, while the subject retains its\nidentity, unless indeed one of the contraries is a constitutive\nproperty of that subject, as heat is of fire. For it is possible that\nthat that which is healthy should become diseased, that which is white,\nblack, that which is cold, hot, that which is good, bad, that which is\nbad, good. The bad man, if he is being brought into a better way of\nlife and thought, may make some advance, however slight, and if he\nshould once improve, even ever so little, it is plain that he might\nchange completely, or at any rate make very great progress; for a man\nbecomes more and more easily moved to virtue, however small the\nimprovement was at first. It is, therefore, natural to suppose that he\nwill make yet greater progress than he has made in the past; and as\nthis process goes on, it will change him completely and establish him\nin the contrary state, provided he is not hindered by lack of time. In\nthe case of 'positives' and 'privatives', however, change in both\ndirections is impossible. There may be a change from possession to\nprivation, but not from privation to possession. The man who has become\nblind does not regain his sight; the man who has become bald does not\nregain his hair; the man who has lost his teeth does not grow a new\nset.\n(iv) Statements opposed as affirmation and negation belong\nmanifestly to a class which is distinct, for in this case, and in this\ncase only, it is necessary for the one opposite to be true and the\nother false.\nNeither in the case of contraries, nor in the case of correlatives, nor\nin the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', is it necessary for one to\nbe true and the other false. Health and disease are contraries: neither\nof them is true or false. 'Double' and 'half' are opposed to each other\nas correlatives: neither of them is true or false. The case is the\nsame, of course, with regard to 'positives' and 'privatives' such as\n'sight' and 'blindness'. In short, where there is no sort of\ncombination of words, truth and falsity have no place, and all the\nopposites we have mentioned so far consist of simple words.\nAt the same time, when the words which enter into opposed statements\nare contraries, these, more than any other set of opposites, would seem\nto claim this characteristic. 'Socrates is ill' is the contrary of\n'Socrates is well', but not even of such composite expressions is it\ntrue to say that one of the pair must always be true and the other\nfalse. For if Socrates exists, one will be true and the other false,\nbut if he does not exist, both will be false; for neither 'Socrates is\nill' nor 'Socrates is well' is true, if Socrates does not exist at all.\nIn the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', if the subject does not\nexist at all, neither proposition is true, but even if the subject\nexists, it is not always the fact that one is true and the other false.\nFor 'Socrates has sight' is the opposite of 'Socrates is blind' in the\nsense of the word 'opposite' which applies to possession and privation.\nNow if Socrates exists, it is not necessary that one should be true and\nthe other false, for when he is not yet able to acquire the power of\nvision, both are false, as also if Socrates is altogether non-existent.\nBut in the case of affirmation and negation, whether the subject exists\nor not, one is always false and the other true. For manifestly, if\nSocrates exists, one of the two propositions 'Socrates is ill',\n'Socrates is not ill', is true, and the other false. This is likewise\nthe case if he does not exist; for if he does not exist, to say that he\nis ill is false, to say that he is not ill is true. Thus it is in the\ncase of those opposites only, which are opposite in the sense in which\nthe term is used with reference to affirmation and negation, that the\nrule holds good, that one of the pair must be true and the other false.\nPart 11\nThat the contrary of a good is an evil is shown by induction: the\ncontrary of health is disease, of courage, cowardice, and so on. But\nthe contrary of an evil is sometimes a good, sometimes an evil. For\ndefect, which is an evil, has excess for its contrary, this also being\nan evil, and the mean, which is a good, is equally the contrary of the\none and of the other. It is only in a few cases, however, that we see\ninstances of this: in most, the contrary of an evil is a good.\nIn the case of contraries, it is not always necessary that if one\nexists the other should also exist: for if all become healthy there\nwill be health and no disease, and again, if everything turns white,\nthere will be white, but no black. Again, since the fact that Socrates\nis ill is the contrary of the fact that Socrates is well, and two\ncontrary conditions cannot both obtain in one and the same individual\nat the same time, both these contraries could not exist at once: for if\nthat Socrates was well was a fact, then that Socrates was ill could not\npossibly be one.\nIt is plain that contrary attributes must needs be present in subjects\nwhich belong to the same species or genus. Disease and health require\nas their subject the body of an animal; white and black require a body,\nwithout further qualification; justice and injustice require as their\nsubject the human soul.\nMoreover, it is necessary that pairs of contraries should in all cases\neither belong to the same genus or belong to contrary genera or be\nthemselves genera. White and black belong to the same genus, colour;\njustice and injustice, to contrary genera, virtue and vice; while good\nand evil do not belong to genera, but are themselves actual genera,\nwith terms under them.\nPart 12\nThere are four senses in which one thing can be said to be 'prior' to\nanother. Primarily and most properly the term has reference to time: in\nthis sense the word is used to indicate that one thing is older or more\nancient than another, for the expressions 'older' and 'more ancient'\nimply greater length of time.\nSecondly, one thing is said to be 'prior' to another when the sequence\nof their being cannot be reversed. In this sense 'one' is 'prior' to\n'two'. For if 'two' exists, it follows directly that 'one' must exist,\nbut if 'one' exists, it does not follow necessarily that 'two' exists:\nthus the sequence subsisting cannot be reversed. It is agreed, then,\nthat when the sequence of two things cannot be reversed, then that one\non which the other depends is called 'prior' to that other.\nIn the third place, the term 'prior' is used with reference to any\norder, as in the case of science and of oratory. For in sciences which\nuse demonstration there is that which is prior and that which is\nposterior in order; in geometry, the elements are prior to the\npropositions; in reading and writing, the letters of the alphabet are\nprior to the syllables. Similarly, in the case of speeches, the\nexordium is prior in order to the narrative.\nBesides these senses of the word, there is a fourth. That which is\nbetter and more honourable is said to have a natural priority. In\ncommon parlance men speak of those whom they honour and love as 'coming\nfirst' with them. This sense of the word is perhaps the most\nfar-fetched.\nSuch, then, are the different senses in which the term 'prior' is used.\nYet it would seem that besides those mentioned there is yet another.\nFor in those things, the being of each of which implies that of the\nother, that which is in any way the cause may reasonably be said to be\nby nature 'prior' to the effect. It is plain that there are instances\nof this. The fact of the being of a man carries with it the truth of\nthe proposition that he is, and the implication is reciprocal: for if a\nman is, the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, and\nconversely, if the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, then\nhe is. The true proposition, however, is in no way the cause of the\nbeing of the man, but the fact of the man's being does seem somehow to\nbe the cause of the truth of the proposition, for the truth or falsity\nof the proposition depends on the fact of the man's being or not being.\nThus the word 'prior' may be used in five senses.\nPart 13\nThe term 'simultaneous' is primarily and most appropriately applied to\nthose things the genesis of the one of which is simultaneous with that\nof the other; for in such cases neither is prior or posterior to the\nother. Such things are said to be simultaneous in point of time. Those\nthings, again, are 'simultaneous' in point of nature, the being of each\nof which involves that of the other, while at the same time neither is\nthe cause of the other's being. This is the case with regard to the\ndouble and the half, for these are reciprocally dependent, since, if\nthere is a double, there is also a half, and if there is a half, there\nis also a double, while at the same time neither is the cause of the\nbeing of the other.\nAgain, those species which are distinguished one from another and\nopposed one to another within the same genus are said to be\n'simultaneous' in nature. I mean those species which are distinguished\neach from each by one and the same method of division. Thus the\n'winged' species is simultaneous with the 'terrestrial' and the 'water'\nspecies. These are distinguished within the same genus, and are opposed\neach to each, for the genus 'animal' has the 'winged', the\n'terrestrial', and the 'water' species, and no one of these is prior or\nposterior to another; on the contrary, all such things appear to be\n'simultaneous' in nature. Each of these also, the terrestrial, the\nwinged, and the water species, can be divided again into subspecies.\nThose species, then, also will be 'simultaneous' in point of nature,\nwhich, belonging to the same genus, are distinguished each from each by\none and the same method of differentiation.\nBut genera are prior to species, for the sequence of their being cannot\nbe reversed. If there is the species 'water-animal', there will be the\ngenus 'animal', but granted the being of the genus 'animal', it does\nnot follow necessarily that there will be the species 'water-animal'.\nThose things, therefore, are said to be 'simultaneous' in nature, the\nbeing of each of which involves that of the other, while at the same\ntime neither is in any way the cause of the other's being; those\nspecies, also, which are distinguished each from each and opposed\nwithin the same genus. Those things, moreover, are 'simultaneous' in\nthe unqualified sense of the word which come into being at the same\ntime.\nPart 14\nThere are six sorts of movement: generation, destruction, increase,\ndiminution, alteration, and change of place.\nIt is evident in all but one case that all these sorts of movement are\ndistinct each from each. Generation is distinct from destruction,\nincrease and change of place from diminution, and so on. But in the\ncase of alteration it may be argued that the process necessarily\nimplies one or other of the other five sorts of motion. This is not\ntrue, for we may say that all affections, or nearly all, produce in us\nan alteration which is distinct from all other sorts of motion, for\nthat which is affected need not suffer either increase or diminution or\nany of the other sorts of motion. Thus alteration is a distinct sort of\nmotion; for, if it were not, the thing altered would not only be\naltered, but would forthwith necessarily suffer increase or diminution\nor some one of the other sorts of motion in addition; which as a matter\nof fact is not the case. Similarly that which was undergoing the\nprocess of increase or was subject to some other sort of motion would,\nif alteration were not a distinct form of motion, necessarily be\nsubject to alteration also. But there are some things which undergo\nincrease but yet not alteration. The square, for instance, if a gnomon\nis applied to it, undergoes increase but not alteration, and so it is\nwith all other figures of this sort. Alteration and increase,\ntherefore, are distinct.\nSpeaking generally, rest is the contrary of motion. But the different\nforms of motion have their own contraries in other forms; thus\ndestruction is the contrary of generation, diminution of increase, rest\nin a place, of change of place. As for this last, change in the reverse\ndirection would seem to be most truly its contrary; thus motion upwards\nis the contrary of motion downwards and vice versa.\nIn the case of that sort of motion which yet remains, of those that\nhave been enumerated, it is not easy to state what is its contrary. It\nappears to have no contrary, unless one should define the contrary here\nalso either as 'rest in its quality' or as 'change in the direction of\nthe contrary quality', just as we defined the contrary of change of\nplace either as rest in a place or as change in the reverse direction.\nFor a thing is altered when change of quality takes place; therefore\neither rest in its quality or change in the direction of the contrary\nmay be called the contrary of this qualitative form of motion. In this\nway becoming white is the contrary of becoming black; there is\nalteration in the contrary direction, since a change of a qualitative\nnature takes place.\nPart 15\nThe term 'to have' is used in various senses. In the first place it is\nused with reference to habit or disposition or any other quality, for\nwe are said to 'have' a piece of knowledge or a virtue. Then, again, it\nhas reference to quantity, as, for instance, in the case of a man's\nheight; for he is said to 'have' a height of three or four cubits. It\nis used, moreover, with regard to apparel, a man being said to 'have' a\ncoat or tunic; or in respect of something which we have on a part of\nourselves, as a ring on the hand: or in respect of something which is a\npart of us, as hand or foot. The term refers also to content, as in the\ncase of a vessel and wheat, or of a jar and wine; a jar is said to\n'have' wine, and a corn-measure wheat. The expression in such cases has\nreference to content. Or it refers to that which has been acquired; we\nare said to 'have' a house or a field. A man is also said to 'have' a\nwife, and a wife a husband, and this appears to be the most remote\nmeaning of the term, for by the use of it we mean simply that the\nhusband lives with the wife.\nOther senses of the word might perhaps be found, but the most ordinary\nones have all been enumerated.", "source": "the_categories.txt"}

Following, then, the order of nature, let us begin\nwith the principles which come first.\nEpic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and Dithyrambic: poetry, and the\nmusic of the flute and of the lyre in most of their forms, are all in\ntheir general conception modes of imitation. They differ, however, from\none: another in three respects,--the medium, the objects, the manner or\nmode of imitation, being in each case distinct.\nFor as there are persons who, by conscious art or mere habit, imitate\nand represent various objects through the medium of colour and form, or\nagain by the voice; so in the arts above mentioned, taken as a whole,\nthe imitation is produced by rhythm, language, or 'harmony,' either\nsingly or combined.\nThus in the music of the flute and of the lyre, 'harmony' and rhythm\nalone are employed; also in other arts, such as that of the shepherd's\npipe, which are essentially similar to these. In dancing, rhythm alone\nis used without 'harmony'; for even dancing imitates character, emotion,\nand action, by rhythmical movement.\nThere is another art which imitates by means of language alone, and\nthat either in prose or verse--which, verse, again, may either combine\ndifferent metres or consist of but one kind--but this has hitherto been\nwithout a name. For there is no common term we could apply to the mimes\nof Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues on the one hand;\nand, on the other, to poetic imitations in iambic, elegiac, or any\nsimilar metre. People do, indeed, add the word 'maker' or 'poet' to\nthe name of the metre, and speak of elegiac poets, or epic (that is,\nhexameter) poets, as if it were not the imitation that makes the poet,\nbut the verse that entitles them all indiscriminately to the name. Even\nwhen a treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out in verse,\nthe name of poet is by custom given to the author; and yet Homer and\nEmpedocles have nothing in common but the metre, so that it would be\nright to call the one poet, the other physicist rather than poet. On the\nsame principle, even if a writer in his poetic imitation were to combine\nall metres, as Chaeremon did in his Centaur, which is a medley composed\nof metres of all kinds, we should bring him too under the general term\npoet. So much then for these distinctions.\nThere are, again, some arts which employ all the means above mentioned,\nnamely, rhythm, tune, and metre. Such are Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry,\nand also Tragedy and Comedy; but between them the difference is, that in\nthe first two cases these means are all employed in combination, in the\nlatter, now one means is employed, now another.\nSuch, then, are the differences of the arts with respect to the medium\nof imitation.\nII\nSince the objects of imitation are men in action, and these men must be\neither of a higher or a lower type (for moral character mainly answers\nto these divisions, goodness and badness being the distinguishing marks\nof moral differences), it follows that we must represent men either as\nbetter than in real life, or as worse, or as they are. It is the same\nin painting. Polygnotus depicted men as nobler than they are, Pauson as\nless noble, Dionysius drew them true to life.\nNow it is evident that each of the modes of imitation above mentioned\nwill exhibit these differences, and become a distinct kind in imitating\nobjects that are thus distinct. Such diversities may be found even in\ndancing, flute-playing, and lyre-playing. So again in language, whether\nprose or verse unaccompanied by music. Homer, for example, makes men\nbetter than they are; Cleophon as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the\ninventor of parodies, and Nicochares, the author of the Deiliad, worse\nthan they are. The same thing holds good of Dithyrambs and Nomes;\nhere too one may portray different types, as Timotheus and Philoxenus\ndiffered in representing their Cyclopes. The same distinction marks\noff Tragedy from Comedy; for Comedy aims at representing men as worse,\nTragedy as better than in actual life.\nIII\nThere is still a third difference--the manner in which each of these\nobjects may be imitated. For the medium being the same, and the objects\nthe same, the poet may imitate by narration--in which case he can either\ntake another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person,\nunchanged--or he may present all his characters as living and moving\nbefore us.\nThese, then, as we said at the beginning, are the three differences\nwhich distinguish artistic imitation,--the medium, the objects, and the\nmanner. So that from one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the\nsame kind as Homer--for both imitate higher types of character; from\nanother point of view, of the same kind as Aristophanes--for both\nimitate persons acting and doing. Hence, some say, the name of 'drama'\nis given to such poems, as representing action. For the same reason the\nDorians claim the invention both of Tragedy and Comedy. The claim to\nComedy is put forward by the Megarians,--not only by those of Greece\nproper, who allege that it originated under their democracy, but also\nby the Megarians of Sicily, for the poet Epicharmus, who is much earlier\nthan Chionides and Magnes, belonged to that country. Tragedy too is\nclaimed by certain Dorians of the Peloponnese. In each case they appeal\nto the evidence of language. The outlying villages, they say, are by\nthem called {kappa omega mu alpha iota}, by the Athenians {delta eta\nmu iota}: and they assume that Comedians were so named not from {kappa\nomega mu 'alpha zeta epsilon iota nu}, 'to revel,' but because they\nwandered from village to village (kappa alpha tau alpha / kappa omega mu\nalpha sigma), being excluded contemptuously from the city. They add\nalso that the Dorian word for 'doing' is {delta rho alpha nu}, and the\nAthenian, {pi rho alpha tau tau epsilon iota nu}.\nThis may suffice as to the number and nature of the various modes of\nimitation.\nIV\nPoetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, each of them\nlying deep in our nature. First, the instinct of imitation is implanted\nin man from childhood, one difference between him and other animals\nbeing that he is the most imitative of living creatures, and through\nimitation learns his earliest lessons; and no less universal is the\npleasure felt in things imitated. We have evidence of this in the facts\nof experience. Objects which in themselves we view with pain, we delight\nto contemplate when reproduced with minute fidelity: such as the forms\nof the most ignoble animals and of dead bodies. The cause of this again\nis, that to learn gives the liveliest pleasure, not only to philosophers\nbut to men in general; whose capacity, however, of learning is more\nlimited. Thus the reason why men enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in\ncontemplating it they find themselves learning or inferring, and saying\nperhaps, 'Ah, that is he.' For if you happen not to have seen the\noriginal, the pleasure will be due not to the imitation as such, but to\nthe execution, the colouring, or some such other cause.\nImitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the\ninstinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, metres being manifestly sections of\nrhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed\nby degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave\nbirth to Poetry.\nPoetry now diverged in two directions, according to the individual\ncharacter of the writers. The graver spirits imitated noble actions, and\nthe actions of good men. The more trivial sort imitated the actions of\nmeaner persons, at first composing satires, as the former did hymns to\nthe gods and the praises of famous men. A poem of the satirical kind\ncannot indeed be put down to any author earlier than Homer; though many\nsuch writers probably there were. But from Homer onward, instances\ncan be cited,--his own Margites, for example, and other similar\ncompositions. The appropriate metre was also here introduced; hence the\nmeasure is still called the iambic or lampooning measure, being that\nin which people lampooned one another. Thus the older poets were\ndistinguished as writers of heroic or of lampooning verse.\nAs, in the serious style, Homer is pre-eminent among poets, for he alone\ncombined dramatic form with excellence of imitation, so he too first\nlaid down the main lines of Comedy, by dramatising the ludicrous instead\nof writing personal satire. His Margites bears the same relation to\nComedy that the Iliad and Odyssey do to Tragedy. But when Tragedy and\nComedy came to light, the two classes of poets still followed their\nnatural bent: the lampooners became writers of Comedy, and the Epic\npoets were succeeded by Tragedians, since the drama was a larger and\nhigher form of art.\nWhether Tragedy has as yet perfected its proper types or not; and\nwhether it is to be judged in itself, or in relation also to the\naudience,--this raises another question. Be that as it may, Tragedy--as\nalso Comedy--was at first mere improvisation. The one originated with\nthe authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those of the phallic songs,\nwhich are still in use in many of our cities. Tragedy advanced by slow\ndegrees; each new element that showed itself was in turn developed.\nHaving passed through many changes, it found its natural form, and there\nit stopped.\nAeschylus first introduced a second actor; he diminished the importance\nof the Chorus, and assigned the leading part to the dialogue. Sophocles\nraised the number of actors to three, and added scene-painting.\nMoreover, it was not till late that the short plot was discarded for\none of greater compass, and the grotesque diction of the earlier satyric\nform for the stately manner of Tragedy. The iambic measure then replaced\nthe trochaic tetrameter, which was originally employed when the poetry\nwas of the Satyric order, and had greater affinities with dancing. Once\ndialogue had come in, Nature herself discovered the appropriate measure.\nFor the iambic is, of all measures, the most colloquial: we see it\nin the fact that conversational speech runs into iambic lines more\nfrequently than into any other kind of verse; rarely into hexameters,\nand only when we drop the colloquial intonation. The additions to\nthe number of 'episodes' or acts, and the other accessories of which\ntradition; tells, must be taken as already described; for to discuss\nthem in detail would, doubtless, be a large undertaking.\nV\nComedy is, as we have said, an imitation of characters of a lower type,\nnot, however, in the full sense of the word bad, the Ludicrous being\nmerely a subdivision of the ugly. It consists in some defect or ugliness\nwhich is not painful or destructive. To take an obvious example, the\ncomic mask is ugly and distorted, but does not imply pain.\nThe successive changes through which Tragedy passed, and the authors\nof these changes, are well known, whereas Comedy has had no history,\nbecause it was not at first treated seriously. It was late before the\nArchon granted a comic chorus to a poet; the performers were till then\nvoluntary. Comedy had already taken definite shape when comic poets,\ndistinctively so called, are heard of. Who furnished it with masks, or\nprologues, or increased the number of actors,--these and other similar\ndetails remain unknown. As for the plot, it came originally from\nSicily; but of Athenian writers Crates was the first who, abandoning the\n'iambic' or lampooning form, generalised his themes and plots.\nEpic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse\nof characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits\nbut one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again,\nin their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine\nitself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this\nlimit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time. This, then, is\na second point of difference; though at first the same freedom was\nadmitted in Tragedy as in Epic poetry.\nOf their constituent parts some are common to both, some peculiar to\nTragedy, whoever, therefore, knows what is good or bad Tragedy, knows\nalso about Epic poetry. All the elements of an Epic poem are found in\nTragedy, but the elements of a Tragedy are not all found in the Epic\npoem.\nVI\nOf the poetry which imitates in hexameter verse, and of Comedy, we\nwill speak hereafter. Let us now discuss Tragedy, resuming its formal\ndefinition, as resulting from what has been already said.\nTragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete,\nand of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of\nartistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of\nthe play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and\nfear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions. By 'language\nembellished,' I mean language into which rhythm, 'harmony,' and song\nenter. By 'the several kinds in separate parts,' I mean, that some parts\nare rendered through the medium of verse alone, others again with the\naid of song.\nNow as tragic imitation implies persons acting, it necessarily follows,\nin the first place, that Spectacular equipment will be a part of\nTragedy. Next, Song and Diction, for these are the medium of imitation.\nBy 'Diction' I mean the mere metrical arrangement of the words: as for\n'Song,' it is a term whose sense every one understands.\nAgain, Tragedy is the imitation of an action; and an action implies\npersonal agents, who necessarily possess certain distinctive qualities\nboth of character and thought; for it is by these that we qualify\nactions themselves, and these--thought and character--are the two\nnatural causes from which actions spring, and on actions again all\nsuccess or failure depends. Hence, the Plot is the imitation of the\naction: for by plot I here mean the arrangement of the incidents. By\nCharacter I mean that in virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to\nthe agents. Thought is required wherever a statement is proved, or, it\nmay be, a general truth enunciated. Every Tragedy, therefore, must have\nsix parts, which parts determine its quality--namely, Plot, Character,\nDiction, Thought, Spectacle, Song. Two of the parts constitute the\nmedium of imitation, one the manner, and three the objects of imitation.\nAnd these complete the list. These elements have been employed, we may\nsay, by the poets to a man; in fact, every play contains Spectacular\nelements as well as Character, Plot, Diction, Song, and Thought.\nBut most important of all is the structure of the incidents. For Tragedy\nis an imitation, not of men, but of an action and of life, and life\nconsists in action, and its end is a mode of action, not a quality. Now\ncharacter determines men's qualities, but it is by their actions that\nthey are happy or the reverse. Dramatic action, therefore, is not with\na view to the representation of character: character comes in as\nsubsidiary to the actions. Hence the incidents and the plot are the\nend of a tragedy; and the end is the chief thing of all. Again, without\naction there cannot be a tragedy; there may be without character.\nThe tragedies of most of our modern poets fail in the rendering of\ncharacter; and of poets in general this is often true. It is the same\nin painting; and here lies the difference between Zeuxis and Polygnotus.\nPolygnotus delineates character well: the style of Zeuxis is devoid\nof ethical quality. Again, if you string together a set of speeches\nexpressive of character, and well finished in point of diction and\nthought, you will not produce the essential tragic effect nearly so well\nas with a play which, however deficient in these respects, yet has a\nplot and artistically constructed incidents. Besides which, the most\npowerful elements of emotional: interest in Tragedy Peripeteia or\nReversal of the Situation, and Recognition scenes--are parts of the\nplot. A further proof is, that novices in the art attain to finish: of\ndiction and precision of portraiture before they can construct the plot.\nIt is the same with almost all the early poets.\nThe Plot, then, is the first principle, and, as it were, the soul of\na tragedy: Character holds the second place. A similar fact is seen in\npainting. The most beautiful colours, laid on confusedly, will not give\nas much pleasure as the chalk outline of a portrait. Thus Tragedy is\nthe imitation of an action, and of the agents mainly with a view to the\naction.\nThird in order is Thought,--that is, the faculty of saying what is\npossible and pertinent in given circumstances. In the case of oratory,\nthis is the function of the Political art and of the art of rhetoric:\nand so indeed the older poets make their characters speak the language\nof civic life; the poets of our time, the language of the rhetoricians.\nCharacter is that which reveals moral purpose, showing what kind of\nthings a man chooses or avoids. Speeches, therefore, which do not make\nthis manifest, or in which the speaker does not choose or avoid anything\nwhatever, are not expressive of character. Thought, on the other hand,\nis found where something is proved to be, or not to be, or a general\nmaxim is enunciated.\nFourth among the elements enumerated comes Diction; by which I mean, as\nhas been already said, the expression of the meaning in words; and its\nessence is the same both in verse and prose.\nOf the remaining elements Song holds the chief place among the\nembellishments.\nThe Spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of\nall the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the\nart of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt\neven apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of\nspectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than\non that of the poet.\nVII\nThese principles being established, let us now discuss the proper\nstructure of the Plot, since this is the first and most important thing\nin Tragedy.\nNow, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action\nthat is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude; for there may\nbe a whole that is wanting in magnitude. A whole is that which has a\nbeginning, a middle, and an end. A beginning is that which does not\nitself follow anything by causal necessity, but after which something\nnaturally is or comes to be. An end, on the contrary, is that which\nitself naturally follows some other thing, either by necessity, or as\na rule, but has nothing following it. A middle is that which follows\nsomething as some other thing follows it. A well constructed plot,\ntherefore, must neither begin nor end at haphazard, but conform to these\nprinciples.\nAgain, a beautiful object, whether it be a living organism or any whole\ncomposed of parts, must not only have an orderly arrangement of parts,\nbut must also be of a certain magnitude; for beauty depends on magnitude\nand order. Hence a very small animal organism cannot be beautiful;\nfor the view of it is confused, the object being seen in an almost\nimperceptible moment of time. Nor, again, can one of vast size be\nbeautiful; for as the eye cannot take it all in at once, the unity and\nsense of the whole is lost for the spectator; as for instance if there\nwere one a thousand miles long. As, therefore, in the case of animate\nbodies and organisms a certain magnitude is necessary, and a magnitude\nwhich may be easily embraced in one view; so in the plot, a certain\nlength is necessary, and a length which can be easily embraced by the\nmemory. The limit of length in relation to dramatic competition and\nsensuous presentment, is no part of artistic theory. For had it been the\nrule for a hundred tragedies to compete together, the performance would\nhave been regulated by the water-clock,--as indeed we are told was\nformerly done. But the limit as fixed by the nature of the drama itself\nis this: the greater the length, the more beautiful will the piece be\nby reason of its size, provided that the whole be perspicuous. And\nto define the matter roughly, we may say that the proper magnitude is\ncomprised within such limits, that the sequence of events, according\nto the law of probability or necessity, will admit of a change from bad\nfortune to good, or from good fortune to bad.\nVIII\nUnity of plot does not, as some persons think, consist in the Unity of\nthe hero. For infinitely various are the incidents in one man's life\nwhich cannot be reduced to unity; and so, too, there are many actions of\none man out of which we cannot make one action. Hence, the error, as it\nappears, of all poets who have composed a Heracleid, a Theseid, or other\npoems of the kind. They imagine that as Heracles was one man, the story\nof Heracles must also be a unity. But Homer, as in all else he is of\nsurpassing merit, here too--whether from art or natural genius--seems\nto have happily discerned the truth. In composing the Odyssey he did not\ninclude all the adventures of Odysseus--such as his wound on Parnassus,\nor his feigned madness at the mustering of the host--incidents between\nwhich there was no necessary or probable connection: but he made the\nOdyssey, and likewise the Iliad, to centre round an action that in our\nsense of the word is one. As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the\nimitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an\nimitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the\nstructural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is\ndisplaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a\nthing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an\norganic part of the whole.\nIX\nIt is, moreover, evident from what has been said, that it is not\nthe function of the poet to relate what has happened, but what may\nhappen,--what is possible according to the law of probability or\nnecessity. The poet and the historian differ not by writing in verse or\nin prose. The work of Herodotus might be put into verse, and it would\nstill be a species of history, with metre no less than without it. The\ntrue difference is that one relates what has happened, the other what\nmay happen. Poetry, therefore, is a more philosophical and a higher\nthing than history: for poetry tends to express the universal, history\nthe particular. By the universal, I mean how a person of a certain type\nwill on occasion speak or act, according to the law of probability or\nnecessity; and it is this universality at which poetry aims in the names\nshe attaches to the personages. The particular is--for example--what\nAlcibiades did or suffered. In Comedy this is already apparent: for here\nthe poet first constructs the plot on the lines of probability, and then\ninserts characteristic names;--unlike the lampooners who write about\nparticular individuals. But tragedians still keep to real names, the\nreason being that what is possible is credible: what has not happened\nwe do not at once feel sure to be possible: but what has happened is\nmanifestly possible: otherwise it would not have happened. Still there\nare even some tragedies in which there are only one or two well known\nnames, the rest being fictitious. In others, none are well known, as in\nAgathon's Antheus, where incidents and names alike are fictitious, and\nyet they give none the less pleasure. We must not, therefore, at all\ncosts keep to the received legends, which are the usual subjects of\nTragedy. Indeed, it would be absurd to attempt it; for even subjects\nthat are known are known only to a few, and yet give pleasure to all.\nIt clearly follows that the poet or 'maker' should be the maker of plots\nrather than of verses; since he is a poet because he imitates, and what\nhe imitates are actions. And even if he chances to take an historical\nsubject, he is none the less a poet; for there is no reason why some\nevents that have actually happened should not conform to the law of the\nprobable and possible, and in virtue of that quality in them he is their\npoet or maker.\nOf all plots and actions the epeisodic are the worst. I call a plot\n'epeisodic' in which the episodes or acts succeed one another without\nprobable or necessary sequence. Bad poets compose such pieces by their\nown fault, good poets, to please the players; for, as they write show\npieces for competition, they stretch the plot beyond its capacity, and\nare often forced to break the natural continuity.\nBut again, Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but of\nevents inspiring fear or pity. Such an effect is best produced when the\nevents come on us by surprise; and the effect is heightened when, at the\nsame time, they follow as cause and effect. The tragic wonder will thee\nbe greater than if they happened of themselves or by accident; for even\ncoincidences are most striking when they have an air of design. We may\ninstance the statue of Mitys at Argos, which fell upon his murderer\nwhile he was a spectator at a festival, and killed him. Such events seem\nnot to be due to mere chance. Plots, therefore, constructed on these\nprinciples are necessarily the best.\nX\nPlots are either Simple or Complex, for the actions in real life, of\nwhich the plots are an imitation, obviously show a similar distinction.\nAn action which is one and continuous in the sense above defined, I call\nSimple, when the change of fortune takes place without Reversal of the\nSituation and without Recognition.\nA Complex action is one in which the change is accompanied by such\nReversal, or by Recognition, or by both. These last should arise from\nthe internal structure of the plot, so that what follows should be the\nnecessary or probable result of the preceding action. It makes all the\ndifference whether any given event is a case of propter hoc or post hoc.\nXI\nReversal of the Situation is a change by which the action veers round\nto its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity.\nThus in the Oedipus, the messenger comes to cheer Oedipus and free\nhim from his alarms about his mother, but by revealing who he is, he\nproduces the opposite effect. Again in the Lynceus, Lynceus is being led\naway to his death, and Danaus goes with him, meaning, to slay him; but\nthe outcome of the preceding incidents is that Danaus is killed and\nLynceus saved. Recognition, as the name indicates, is a change from\nignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons\ndestined by the poet for good or bad fortune. The best form of\nrecognition is coincident with a Reversal of the Situation, as in the\nOedipus. There are indeed other forms. Even inanimate things of the most\ntrivial kind may in a sense be objects of recognition. Again, we may\nrecognise or discover whether a person has done a thing or not. But the\nrecognition which is most intimately connected with the plot and action\nis, as we have said, the recognition of persons. This recognition,\ncombined, with Reversal, will produce either pity or fear; and actions\nproducing these effects are those which, by our definition, Tragedy\nrepresents. Moreover, it is upon such situations that the issues of good\nor bad fortune will depend. Recognition, then, being between persons,\nit may happen that one person only is recognised by the other-when the\nlatter is already known--or it may be necessary that the recognition\nshould be on both sides. Thus Iphigenia is revealed to Orestes by the\nsending of the letter; but another act of recognition is required to\nmake Orestes known to Iphigenia.\nTwo parts, then, of the Plot--Reversal of the Situation and\nRecognition--turn upon surprises. A third part is the Scene of\nSuffering. The Scene of Suffering is a destructive or painful action,\nsuch as death on the stage, bodily agony, wounds and the like.\nXII\n[The parts of Tragedy which must be treated as elements of the whole\nhave been already mentioned. We now come to the quantitative parts,\nand the separate parts into which Tragedy is divided, namely, Prologue,\nEpisode, Exode, Choric song; this last being divided into Parode and\nStasimon. These are common to all plays: peculiar to some are the songs\nof actors from the stage and the Commoi.\nThe Prologue is that entire part of a tragedy which precedes the Parode\nof the Chorus. The Episode is that entire part of a tragedy which\nis between complete choric songs. The Exode is that entire part of a\ntragedy which has no choric song after it. Of the Choric part the Parode\nis the first undivided utterance of the Chorus: the Stasimon is a Choric\node without anapaests or trochaic tetrameters: the Commos is a joint\nlamentation of Chorus and actors. The parts of Tragedy which must\nbe treated as elements of the whole have been already mentioned. The\nquantitative parts the separate parts into which it is divided--are here\nenumerated.]\nXIII\nAs the sequel to what has already been said, we must proceed to consider\nwhat the poet should aim at, and what he should avoid, in constructing\nhis plots; and by what means the specific effect of Tragedy will be\nproduced.\nA perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple\nbut on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which\nexcite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic\nimitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change, of\nfortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought\nfrom prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it\nmerely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity\nto prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy;\nit possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral\nsense nor calls forth pity or fear. Nor, again, should the downfall of\nthe utter villain be exhibited. A plot of this kind would, doubtless,\nsatisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for\npity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man\nlike ourselves. Such an event, therefore, will be neither pitiful\nnor terrible. There remains, then, the character between these two\nextremes,--that of a man who is not eminently good and just,-yet whose\nmisfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error\nor frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous,--a\npersonage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such\nfamilies.\nA well constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue,\nrather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not\nfrom bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about\nas the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a\ncharacter either such as we have described, or better rather than\nworse. The practice of the stage bears out our view. At first the poets\nrecounted any legend that came in their way. Now, the best tragedies\nare founded on the story of a few houses, on the fortunes of Alcmaeon,\nOedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who\nhave done or suffered something terrible. A tragedy, then, to be perfect\naccording to the rules of art should be of this construction. Hence\nthey are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this\nprinciple in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have\nsaid, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in\ndramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most\ntragic in effect; and Euripides, faulty though he may be in the general\nmanagement of his subject, yet is felt to be the most tragic of the\npoets.\nIn the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first.\nLike the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite\ncatastrophe for the good and for the bad. It is accounted the best\nbecause of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in\nwhat he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however,\nthence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to\nComedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies--like\nOrestes and Aegisthus--quit the stage as friends at the close, and no\none slays or is slain.\nXIV\nFear and pity may be aroused by spectacular means; but they may also\nresult from the inner structure of the piece, which is the better way,\nand indicates a superior poet. For the plot ought to be so constructed\nthat, even without the aid of the eye, he who hears the tale told will\nthrill with horror and melt to pity at what takes place. This is the\nimpression we should receive from hearing the story of the Oedipus. But\nto produce this effect by the mere spectacle is a less artistic method,\nand dependent on extraneous aids. Those who employ spectacular means\nto create a sense not of the terrible but only of the monstrous, are\nstrangers to the purpose of Tragedy; for we must not demand of Tragedy\nany and every kind of pleasure, but only that which is proper to it. And\nsince the pleasure which the poet should afford is that which comes from\npity and fear through imitation, it is evident that this quality must be\nimpressed upon the incidents.\nLet us then determine what are the circumstances which strike us as\nterrible or pitiful.\nActions capable of this effect must happen between persons who are\neither friends or enemies or indifferent to one another. If an enemy\nkills an enemy, there is nothing to excite pity either in the act or\nthe intention,--except so far as the suffering in itself is pitiful.\nSo again with indifferent persons. But when the tragic incident occurs\nbetween those who are near or dear to one another--if, for example, a\nbrother kills, or intends to kill, a brother, a son his father, a mother\nher son, a son his mother, or any other deed of the kind is done--these\nare the situations to be looked for by the poet. He may not indeed\ndestroy the framework of the received legends--the fact, for instance,\nthat Clytemnestra was slain by Orestes and Eriphyle by Alcmaeon but he\nought to show invention of his own, and skilfully handle the traditional\nmaterial. Let us explain more clearly what is meant by skilful handling.\nThe action may be done consciously and with knowledge of the persons, in\nthe manner of the older poets. It is thus too that Euripides makes Medea\nslay her children. Or, again, the deed of horror may be done, but\ndone in ignorance, and the tie of kinship or friendship be discovered\nafterwards. The Oedipus of Sophocles is an example. Here, indeed, the\nincident is outside the drama proper; but cases occur where it falls\nwithin the action of the play: one may cite the Alcmaeon of Astydamas,\nor Telegonus in the Wounded Odysseus. Again, there is a third case,--<to\nbe about to act with knowledge of the persons and then not to act. The\nfourth case is> when some one is about to do an irreparable deed through\nignorance, and makes the discovery before it is done. These are the only\npossible ways. For the deed must either be done or not done,--and that\nwittingly or unwittingly. But of all these ways, to be about to act\nknowing the persons, and then not to act, is the worst. It is shocking\nwithout being tragic, for no disaster follows. It is, therefore, never,\nor very rarely, found in poetry. One instance, however, is in the\nAntigone, where Haemon threatens to kill Creon. The next and better way\nis that the deed should be perpetrated. Still better, that it should be\nperpetrated in ignorance, and the discovery made afterwards. There\nis then nothing to shock us, while the discovery produces a startling\neffect. The last case is the best, as when in the Cresphontes Merope is\nabout to slay her son, but, recognising who he is, spares his life. So\nin the Iphigenia, the sister recognises the brother just in time. Again\nin the Helle, the son recognises the mother when on the point of giving\nher up. This, then, is why a few families only, as has been already\nobserved, furnish the subjects of tragedy. It was not art, but happy\nchance, that led the poets in search of subjects to impress the tragic\nquality upon their plots. They are compelled, therefore, to have\nrecourse to those houses whose history contains moving incidents like\nthese.\nEnough has now been said concerning the structure of the incidents, and\nthe right kind of plot.\nXV\nIn respect of Character there are four things to be aimed at. First, and\nmost important, it must be good. Now any speech or action that manifests\nmoral purpose of any kind will be expressive of character: the character\nwill be good if the purpose is good. This rule is relative to each\nclass. Even a woman may be good, and also a slave; though the woman\nmay be said to be an inferior being, and the slave quite worthless. The\nsecond thing to aim at is propriety. There is a type of manly valour;\nbut valour in a woman, or unscrupulous cleverness, is inappropriate.\nThirdly, character must be true to life: for this is a distinct thing\nfrom goodness and propriety, as here described. The fourth point is\nconsistency: for though the subject of the imitation, who suggested the\ntype, be inconsistent, still he must be consistently inconsistent. As an\nexample of motiveless degradation of character, we have Menelaus in\nthe Orestes: of character indecorous and inappropriate, the lament of\nOdysseus in the Scylla, and the speech of Melanippe: of inconsistency,\nthe Iphigenia at Aulis,--for Iphigenia the suppliant in no way resembles\nher later self.\nAs in the structure of the plot, so too in the portraiture of character,\nthe poet should always aim either at the necessary or the probable. Thus\na person of a given character should speak or act in a given way, by the\nrule either of necessity or of probability; just as this event should\nfollow that by necessary or probable sequence. It is therefore evident\nthat the unravelling of the plot, no less than the complication, must\narise out of the plot itself, it must not be brought about by the 'Deus\nex Machina'--as in the Medea, or in the Return of the Greeks in the\nIliad. The 'Deus ex Machina' should be employed only for events external\nto the drama,--for antecedent or subsequent events, which lie beyond the\nrange of human knowledge, and which require to be reported or foretold;\nfor to the gods we ascribe the power of seeing all things. Within the\naction there must be nothing irrational. If the irrational cannot be\nexcluded, it should be outside the scope of the tragedy. Such is the\nirrational element in the Oedipus of Sophocles.\nAgain, since Tragedy is an imitation of persons who are above the common\nlevel, the example of good portrait-painters should be followed. They,\nwhile reproducing the distinctive form of the original, make a likeness\nwhich is true to life and yet more beautiful. So too the poet, in\nrepresenting men who are irascible or indolent, or have other defects\nof character, should preserve the type and yet ennoble it. In this way\nAchilles is portrayed by Agathon and Homer.\nThese then are rules the poet should observe. Nor should he neglect\nthose appeals to the senses, which, though not among the essentials, are\nthe concomitants of poetry; for here too there is much room for error.\nBut of this enough has been said in our published treatises.\nXVI\nWhat Recognition is has been already explained. We will now enumerate\nits kinds.\nFirst, the least artistic form, which, from poverty of wit, is\nmost commonly employed recognition by signs. Of these some are\ncongenital,--such as 'the spear which the earth-born race bear on their\nbodies,' or the stars introduced by Carcinus in his Thyestes. Others are\nacquired after birth; and of these some are bodily marks, as scars; some\nexternal tokens, as necklaces, or the little ark in the Tyro by which\nthe discovery is effected. Even these admit of more or less skilful\ntreatment. Thus in the recognition of Odysseus by his scar, the\ndiscovery is made in one way by the nurse, in another by the swineherds.\nThe use of tokens for the express purpose of proof--and, indeed,\nany formal proof with or without tokens--is a less artistic mode of\nrecognition. A better kind is that which comes about by a turn of\nincident, as in the Bath Scene in the Odyssey.\nNext come the recognitions invented at will by the poet, and on that\naccount wanting in art. For example, Orestes in the Iphigenia reveals\nthe fact that he is Orestes. She, indeed, makes herself known by the\nletter; but he, by speaking himself, and saying what the poet, not what\nthe plot requires. This, therefore, is nearly allied to the fault above\nmentioned:--for Orestes might as well have brought tokens with him.\nAnother similar instance is the 'voice of the shuttle' in the Tereus of\nSophocles.\nThe third kind depends on memory when the sight of some object awakens\na feeling: as in the Cyprians of Dicaeogenes, where the hero breaks into\ntears on seeing the picture; or again in the 'Lay of Alcinous,' where\nOdysseus, hearing the minstrel play the lyre, recalls the past and\nweeps; and hence the recognition.\nThe fourth kind is by process of reasoning. Thus in the Choephori: 'Some\none resembling me has come: no one resembles me but Orestes: therefore\nOrestes has come.' Such too is the discovery made by Iphigenia in the\nplay of Polyidus the Sophist. It was a natural reflection for Orestes to\nmake, 'So I too must die at the altar like my sister.' So, again, in\nthe Tydeus of Theodectes, the father says, 'I came to find my son, and\nI lose my own life.' So too in the Phineidae: the women, on seeing the\nplace, inferred their fate:--'Here we are doomed to die, for here\nwe were cast forth.' Again, there is a composite kind of recognition\ninvolving false inference on the part of one of the characters, as in\nthe Odysseus Disguised as a Messenger. A said <that no one else was able\nto bend the bow;... hence B (the disguised Odysseus) imagined that A\nwould> recognise the bow which, in fact, he had not seen; and to bring\nabout a recognition by this means that the expectation A would recognise\nthe bow is false inference.\nBut, of all recognitions, the best is that which arises from the\nincidents themselves, where the startling discovery is made by natural\nmeans. Such is that in the Oedipus of Sophocles, and in the Iphigenia;\nfor it was natural that Iphigenia should wish to dispatch a letter.\nThese recognitions alone dispense with the artificial aid of tokens or\namulets. Next come the recognitions by process of reasoning.\nXVII\nIn constructing the plot and working it out with the proper diction,\nthe poet should place the scene, as far as possible, before his eyes. In\nthis way, seeing everything with the utmost vividness, as if he were a\nspectator of the action, he will discover what is in keeping with it,\nand be most unlikely to overlook inconsistencies. The need of such a\nrule is shown by the fault found in Carcinus. Amphiaraus was on his way\nfrom the temple. This fact escaped the observation of one who did not\nsee the situation. On the stage, however, the piece failed, the audience\nbeing offended at the oversight.\nAgain, the poet should work out his play, to the best of his power, with\nappropriate gestures; for those who feel emotion are most convincing\nthrough natural sympathy with the characters they represent; and one\nwho is agitated storms, one who is angry rages, with the most life-like\nreality. Hence poetry implies either a happy gift of nature or a strain\nof madness. In the one case a man can take the mould of any character;\nin the other, he is lifted out of his proper self.\nAs for the story, whether the poet takes it ready made or constructs it\nfor himself, he should first sketch its general outline, and then\nfill in the episodes and amplify in detail. The general plan may be\nillustrated by the Iphigenia. A young girl is sacrificed; she disappears\nmysteriously from the eyes of those who sacrificed her; She is\ntransported to another country, where the custom is to offer up all\nstrangers to the goddess. To this ministry she is appointed. Some time\nlater her own brother chances to arrive. The fact that the oracle for\nsome reason ordered him to go there, is outside the general plan of the\nplay. The purpose, again, of his coming is outside the action proper.\nHowever, he comes, he is seized, and, when on the point of being\nsacrificed, reveals who he is. The mode of recognition may be either\nthat of Euripides or of Polyidus, in whose play he exclaims very\nnaturally:--'So it was not my sister only, but I too, who was doomed to\nbe sacrificed'; and by that remark he is saved.\nAfter this, the names being once given, it remains to fill in the\nepisodes. We must see that they are relevant to the action. In the case\nof Orestes, for example, there is the madness which led to his capture,\nand his deliverance by means of the purificatory rite. In the drama, the\nepisodes are short, but it is these that give extension to Epic poetry.\nThus the story of the Odyssey can be stated briefly. A certain man is\nabsent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon,\nand left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight--suitors\nare wasting his substance and plotting against his son. At length,\ntempest-tost, he himself arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted\nwith him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, and is himself\npreserved while he destroys them. This is the essence of the plot; the\nrest is episode.\nXVIII\nEvery tragedy falls into two parts,--Complication and Unravelling or\nDenouement. Incidents extraneous to the action are frequently combined\nwith a portion of the action proper, to form the Complication; the rest\nis the Unravelling. By the Complication I mean all that extends from\nthe beginning of the action to the part which marks the turning-point\nto good or bad fortune. The Unravelling is that which extends from the\nbeginning of the change to the end. Thus, in the Lynceus of Theodectes,\nthe Complication consists of the incidents presupposed in the drama, the\nseizure of the child, and then again, The Unravelling extends from\nthe accusation of murder to the end.\nThere are four kinds of Tragedy, the Complex, depending entirely on\nReversal of the Situation and Recognition; the Pathetic (where the\nmotive is passion),--such as the tragedies on Ajax and Ixion; the\nEthical (where the motives are ethical),--such as the Phthiotides and\nthe Peleus. The fourth kind is the Simple <We here exclude the purely\nspectacular element>, exemplified by the Phorcides, the Prometheus, and\nscenes laid in Hades. The poet should endeavour, if possible, to combine\nall poetic elements; or failing that, the greatest number and those the\nmost important; the more so, in face of the cavilling criticism of the\nday. For whereas there have hitherto been good poets, each in his own\nbranch, the critics now expect one man to surpass all others in their\nseveral lines of excellence.\nIn speaking of a tragedy as the same or different, the best test to take\nis the plot. Identity exists where the Complication and Unravelling are\nthe same. Many poets tie the knot well, but unravel it ill. Both arts,\nhowever, should always be mastered.\nAgain, the poet should remember what has been often said, and not make\nan Epic structure into a Tragedy--by an Epic structure I mean one with\na multiplicity of plots--as if, for instance, you were to make a tragedy\nout of the entire story of the Iliad. In the Epic poem, owing to its\nlength, each part assumes its proper magnitude. In the drama the result\nis far from answering to the poet's expectation. The proof is that the\npoets who have dramatised the whole story of the Fall of Troy, instead\nof selecting portions, like Euripides; or who have taken the whole\ntale of Niobe, and not a part of her story, like Aeschylus, either fail\nutterly or meet with poor success on the stage. Even Agathon has been\nknown to fail from this one defect. In his Reversals of the Situation,\nhowever, he shows a marvellous skill in the effort to hit the popular\ntaste,--to produce a tragic effect that satisfies the moral sense. This\neffect is produced when the clever rogue, like Sisyphus, is outwitted,\nor the brave villain defeated. Such an event is probable in Agathon's\nsense of the word: 'it is probable,' he says, 'that many things should\nhappen contrary to probability.'\nThe Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should be an\nintegral part of the whole, and share in the action, in the manner not\nof Euripides but of Sophocles. As for the later poets, their choral\nsongs pertain as little to the subject of the piece as to that of any\nother tragedy. They are, therefore, sung as mere interludes, a practice\nfirst begun by Agathon. Yet what difference is there between introducing\nsuch choral interludes, and transferring a speech, or even a whole act,\nfrom one play to another?\nXIX\nIt remains to speak of Diction and Thought, the other parts of Tragedy\nhaving been already discussed. Concerning Thought, we may assume what\nis said in the Rhetoric, to which inquiry the subject more strictly\nbelongs. Under Thought is included every effect which has to be produced\nby speech, the subdivisions being,--proof and refutation; the excitation\nof the feelings, such as pity, fear, anger, and the like; the suggestion\nof importance or its opposite. Now, it is evident that the dramatic\nincidents must be treated from the same points of view as the dramatic\nspeeches, when the object is to evoke the sense of pity, fear,\nimportance, or probability. The only difference is, that the incidents\nshould speak for themselves without verbal exposition; while the effects\naimed at in speech should be produced by the speaker, and as a result of\nthe speech. For what were the business of a speaker, if the Thought were\nrevealed quite apart from what he says?\nNext, as regards Diction. One branch of the inquiry treats of the Modes\nof Utterance. But this province of knowledge belongs to the art\nof Delivery and to the masters of that science. It includes, for\ninstance,--what is a command, a prayer, a statement, a threat, a\nquestion, an answer, and so forth. To know or not to know these things\ninvolves no serious censure upon the poet's art. For who can admit\nthe fault imputed to Homer by Protagoras,--that in the words, 'Sing,\ngoddess, of the wrath,' he gives a command under the idea that he utters\na prayer? For to tell some one to do a thing or not to do it is, he\nsays, a command. We may, therefore, pass this over as an inquiry that\nbelongs to another art, not to poetry.\nXX\n[Language in general includes the following parts:--Letter, Syllable,\nConnecting word, Noun, Verb, Inflexion or Case, Sentence or Phrase.\nA Letter is an indivisible sound, yet not every such sound, but only\none which can form part of a group of sounds. For even brutes utter\nindivisible sounds, none of which I call a letter. The sound I mean\nmay be either a vowel, a semi-vowel, or a mute. A vowel is that which\nwithout impact of tongue or lip has an audible sound. A semi-vowel, that\nwhich with such impact has an audible sound, as S and R. A mute, that\nwhich with such impact has by itself no sound, but joined to a vowel\nsound becomes audible, as G and D. These are distinguished according\nto the form assumed by the mouth and the place where they are produced;\naccording as they are aspirated or smooth, long or short; as they are\nacute, grave, or of an intermediate tone; which inquiry belongs in\ndetail to the writers on metre.\nA Syllable is a non-significant sound, composed of a mute and a\nvowel: for GR without A is a syllable, as also with A,--GRA. But the\ninvestigation of these differences belongs also to metrical science.\nA Connecting word is a non-significant sound, which neither causes nor\nhinders the union of many sounds into one significant sound; it may\nbe placed at either end or in the middle of a sentence. Or, a\nnon-significant sound, which out of several sounds, each of them\nsignificant, is capable of forming one significant sound,--as {alpha mu\ntheta iota}, {pi epsilon rho iota}, and the like. Or, a non-significant\nsound, which marks the beginning, end, or division of a sentence; such,\nhowever, that it cannot correctly stand by itself at the beginning of a\nsentence, as {mu epsilon nu}, {eta tau omicron iota}, {delta epsilon}.\nA Noun is a composite significant sound, not marking time, of which no\npart is in itself significant: for in double or compound words we do not\nemploy the separate parts as if each were in itself significant. Thus\nin Theodorus, 'god-given,' the {delta omega rho omicron nu} or 'gift' is\nnot in itself significant.\nA Verb is a composite significant sound, marking time, in which, as in\nthe noun, no part is in itself significant. For 'man,' or 'white' does\nnot express the idea of 'when'; but 'he walks,' or 'he has walked' does\nconnote time, present or past.\nInflexion belongs both to the noun and verb, and expresses either the\nrelation 'of,' 'to,' or the like; or that of number, whether one or\nmany, as 'man' or 'men '; or the modes or tones in actual delivery, e.g.\na question or a command. 'Did he go?' and 'go' are verbal inflexions of\nthis kind.\nA Sentence or Phrase is a composite significant sound, some at least of\nwhose parts are in themselves significant; for not every such group\nof words consists of verbs and nouns--'the definition of man,' for\nexample--but it may dispense even with the verb. Still it will always\nhave some significant part, as 'in walking,' or 'Cleon son of Cleon.' A\nsentence or phrase may form a unity in two ways,--either as signifying\none thing, or as consisting of several parts linked together. Thus the\nIliad is one by the linking together of parts, the definition of man by\nthe unity of the thing signified.]\nXXI\nWords are of two kinds, simple and double. By simple I mean those\ncomposed of non-significant elements, such as {gamma eta}. By double\nor compound, those composed either of a significant and non-significant\nelement (though within the whole word no element is significant), or\nof elements that are both significant. A word may likewise be triple,\nquadruple, or multiple in form, like so many Massilian expressions, e.g.\n'Hermo-caico-xanthus who prayed to Father Zeus>.'\nEvery word is either current, or strange, or metaphorical, or\nornamental, or newly-coined, or lengthened, or contracted, or altered.\nBy a current or proper word I mean one which is in general use among\na people; by a strange word, one which is in use in another country.\nPlainly, therefore, the same word may be at once strange and current,\nbut not in relation to the same people. The word {sigma iota gamma\nupsilon nu omicron nu}, 'lance,' is to the Cyprians a current term but\nto us a strange one.\nMetaphor is the application of an alien name by transference either from\ngenus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species,\nor by analogy, that is, proportion. Thus from genus to species, as:\n'There lies my ship'; for lying at anchor is a species of lying. From\nspecies to genus, as: 'Verily ten thousand noble deeds hath Odysseus\nwrought'; for ten thousand is a species of large number, and is here\nused for a large number generally. From species to species, as: 'With\nblade of bronze drew away the life,' and 'Cleft the water with the\nvessel of unyielding bronze.' Here {alpha rho upsilon rho alpha iota},\n'to draw away,' is used for {tau alpha mu epsilon iota nu}, 'to cleave,'\nand {tau alpha mu epsilon iota nu} again for {alpha rho upsilon alpha\niota},--each being a species of taking away. Analogy or proportion is\nwhen the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We\nmay then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth.\nSometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the\nproper word is relative. Thus the cup is to Dionysus as the shield to\nAres. The cup may, therefore, be called 'the shield of Dionysus,' and\nthe shield 'the cup of Ares.' Or, again, as old age is to life, so is\nevening to day. Evening may therefore be called 'the old age of\nthe day,' and old age, 'the evening of life,' or, in the phrase\nof Empedocles, 'life's setting sun.' For some of the terms of the\nproportion there is at times no word in existence; still the metaphor\nmay be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the\naction of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still this process\nbears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. Hence the\nexpression of the poet 'sowing the god-created light.' There is another\nway in which this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply an\nalien term, and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes; as\nif we were to call the shield, not 'the cup of Ares,' but 'the wineless\ncup.'\n{An ornamental word...}\nA newly-coined word is one which has never been even in local use, but\nis adopted by the poet himself. Some such words there appear to be: as\n{epsilon rho nu upsilon gamma epsilon sigma}, 'sprouters,' for {kappa\nepsilon rho alpha tau alpha}, 'horns,' and {alpha rho eta tau eta rho},\n'supplicator,' for {iota epsilon rho epsilon upsilon sigma}, 'priest.'\nA word is lengthened when its own vowel is exchanged for a longer one,\nor when a syllable is inserted. A word is contracted when some part of\nit is removed. Instances of lengthening are,--{pi omicron lambda eta\nomicron sigma} for {pi omicron lambda epsilon omega sigma}, and {Pi eta\nlambda eta iota alpha delta epsilon omega} for {Pi eta lambda epsilon\niota delta omicron upsilon}: of contraction,--{kappa rho iota}, {delta\nomega}, and {omicron psi}, as in {mu iota alpha / gamma iota nu epsilon\ntau alpha iota / alpha mu phi omicron tau episilon rho omega nu /\nomicron psi}.\nAn altered word is one in which part of the ordinary form is left\nunchanged, and part is re-cast; as in {delta epsilon xi iota-tau epsilon\nrho omicron nu / kappa alpha tau alpha / mu alpha zeta omicron nu},\n{delta epsilon xi iota tau epsilon rho omicron nu} is for {delta epsilon\nxi iota omicron nu}.\n[Nouns in themselves are either masculine, feminine, or neuter.\nMasculine are such as end in {nu}, {rho}, {sigma}, or in some letter\ncompounded with {sigma},--these being two, and {xi}. Feminine, such as\nend in vowels that are always long, namely {eta} and {omega}, and--of\nvowels that admit of lengthening--those in {alpha}. Thus the number of\nletters in which nouns masculine and feminine end is the same; for {psi}\nand {xi} are equivalent to endings in {sigma}. No noun ends in a mute\nor a vowel short by nature. Three only end in {iota},--{mu eta lambda\niota}, {kappa omicron mu mu iota}, {pi epsilon pi epsilon rho iota}:\nfive end in {upsilon}. Neuter nouns end in these two latter vowels; also\nin {nu} and {sigma}.]\nXXII\nThe perfection of style is to be clear without being mean. The clearest\nstyle is that which uses only current or proper words; at the same\ntime it is mean:--witness the poetry of Cleophon and of Sthenelus. That\ndiction, on the other hand, is lofty and raised above the commonplace\nwhich employs unusual words. By unusual, I mean strange (or rare) words,\nmetaphorical, lengthened,--anything, in short, that differs from the\nnormal idiom. Yet a style wholly composed of such words is either a\nriddle or a jargon; a riddle, if it consists of metaphors; a jargon, if\nit consists of strange (or rare) words. For the essence of a riddle is\nto express true facts under impossible combinations. Now this cannot be\ndone by any arrangement of ordinary words, but by the use of metaphor it\ncan. Such is the riddle:--'A man I saw who on another man had glued the\nbronze by aid of fire,' and others of the same kind. A diction that\nis made up of strange (or rare) terms is a jargon. A certain infusion,\ntherefore, of these elements is necessary to style; for the strange (or\nrare) word, the metaphorical, the ornamental, and the other kinds above\nmentioned, will raise it above the commonplace and mean, while the use\nof proper words will make it perspicuous. But nothing contributes more\nto produce a clearness of diction that is remote from commonness than\nthe lengthening, contraction, and alteration of words. For by deviating\nin exceptional cases from the normal idiom, the language will gain\ndistinction; while, at the same time, the partial conformity with usage\nwill give perspicuity. The critics, therefore, are in error who censure\nthese licenses of speech, and hold the author up to ridicule. Thus\nEucleides, the elder, declared that it would be an easy matter to be\na poet if you might lengthen syllables at will. He caricatured the\npractice in the very form of his diction, as in the verse: '{Epsilon pi\niota chi alpha rho eta nu / epsilon iota delta omicron nu / Mu alpha rho\nalpha theta omega nu alpha delta epsilon / Beta alpha delta iota zeta\nomicron nu tau alpha}, or, {omicron upsilon kappa / alpha nu / gamma /\nepsilon rho alpha mu epsilon nu omicron sigma / tau omicron nu / epsilon\nkappa epsilon iota nu omicron upsilon /epsilon lambda lambda epsilon\nbeta omicron rho omicron nu}. To employ such license at all obtrusively\nis, no doubt, grotesque; but in any mode of poetic diction there must\nbe moderation. Even metaphors, strange (or rare) words, or any similar\nforms of speech, would produce the like effect if used without propriety\nand with the express purpose of being ludicrous. How great a difference\nis made by the appropriate use of lengthening, may be seen in Epic\npoetry by the insertion of ordinary forms in the verse. So, again, if\nwe take a strange (or rare) word, a metaphor, or any similar mode of\nexpression, and replace it by the current or proper term, the truth of\nour observation will be manifest. For example Aeschylus and Euripides\neach composed the same iambic line. But the alteration of a single word\nby Euripides, who employed the rarer term instead of the ordinary one,\nmakes one verse appear beautiful and the other trivial. Aeschylus in his\nPhiloctetes says: {Phi alpha gamma epsilon delta alpha iota nu alpha /\ndelta / eta / mu omicron upsilon / sigma alpha rho kappa alpha sigma /\nepsilon rho theta iota epsilon iota / pi omicron delta omicron sigma}.\nEuripides substitutes {Theta omicron iota nu alpha tau alpha iota}\n'feasts on' for {epsilon sigma theta iota epsilon iota} 'feeds on.'\nAgain, in the line, {nu upsilon nu / delta epsilon / mu /epsilon omega\nnu / omicron lambda iota gamma iota gamma upsilon sigma / tau epsilon /\nkappa alpha iota / omicron upsilon tau iota delta alpha nu omicron sigma\n/ kappa alpha iota / alpha epsilon iota kappa eta sigma), the difference\nwill be felt if we substitute the common words, {nu upsilon nu / delta\nepsilon / mu / epsilon omega nu / mu iota kappa rho omicron sigma /\ntau epsilon / kappa alpha iota / alpha rho theta epsilon nu iota kappa\nomicron sigma / kappa alpha iota / alpha epsilon iota delta gamma\nsigma}. Or, if for the line, {delta iota phi rho omicron nu / alpha\nepsilon iota kappa epsilon lambda iota omicron nu / kappa alpha tau\nalpha theta epsilon iota sigma / omicron lambda iota gamma eta nu /\ntau epsilon / tau rho alpha pi epsilon iota sigma / omicron lambda iota\ngamma eta nu / tau epsilon / tau rho alpha pi epsilon zeta alpha nu,}\nWe read, {delta iota phi rho omicron nu / mu omicron chi theta eta rho\nomicron nu / kappa alpha tau alpha theta epsilon iota sigma / mu iota\nkappa rho alpha nu / tau epsilon / tau rho alpha pi epsilon zeta alpha\nnu}.\nOr, for {eta iota omicron nu epsilon sigma / beta omicron omicron omega\nrho iota nu, eta iota omicron nu epsilon sigma kappa rho alpha zeta\nomicron upsilon rho iota nu}\nAgain, Ariphrades ridiculed the tragedians for using phrases which no\none would employ in ordinary speech: for example, {delta omega mu alpha\ntau omega nu / alpha pi omicron} instead of {alpha pi omicron / delta\nomega mu alpha tau omega nu}, {rho epsilon theta epsilon nu}, {epsilon\ngamma omega / delta epsilon / nu iota nu}, {Alpha chi iota lambda lambda\nepsilon omega sigma / pi epsilon rho iota} instead of {pi epsilon rho\niota / 'Alpha chi iota lambda lambda epsilon omega sigma}, and the like.\nIt is precisely because such phrases are not part of the current idiom\nthat they give distinction to the style. This, however, he failed to\nsee.\nIt is a great matter to observe propriety in these several modes of\nexpression, as also in compound words, strange (or rare) words, and so\nforth. But the greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor.\nThis alone cannot be imparted by another; it is the mark of genius, for\nto make good metaphors implies an eye for resemblances.\nOf the various kinds of words, the compound are best adapted to\nDithyrambs, rare words to heroic poetry, metaphors to iambic. In heroic\npoetry, indeed, all these varieties are serviceable. But in iambic\nverse, which reproduces, as far as may be, familiar speech, the most\nappropriate words are those which are found even in prose. These\nare,--the current or proper, the metaphorical, the ornamental.\nConcerning Tragedy and imitation by means of action this may suffice.\nXXIII\nAs to that poetic imitation which is narrative in form and employs\na single metre, the plot manifestly ought, as in a tragedy, to be\nconstructed on dramatic principles. It should have for its subject a\nsingle action, whole and complete, with a beginning, a middle, and\nan end. It will thus resemble a living organism in all its unity, and\nproduce the pleasure proper to it. It will differ in structure from\nhistorical compositions, which of necessity present not a single action,\nbut a single period, and all that happened within that period to one\nperson or to many, little connected together as the events may be. For\nas the sea-fight at Salamis and the battle with the Carthaginians in\nSicily took place at the same time, but did not tend to any one result,\nso in the sequence of events, one thing sometimes follows another, and\nyet no single result is thereby produced. Such is the practice, we may\nsay, of most poets. Here again, then, as has been already observed, the\ntranscendent excellence of Homer is manifest. He never attempts to make\nthe whole war of Troy the subject of his poem, though that war had\na beginning and an end. It would have been too vast a theme, and not\neasily embraced in a single view. If, again, he had kept it within\nmoderate limits, it must have been over-complicated by the variety of\nthe incidents. As it is, he detaches a single portion, and admits as\nepisodes many events from the general story of the war--such as the\nCatalogue of the ships and others--thus diversifying the poem. All other\npoets take a single hero, a single period, or an action single indeed,\nbut with a multiplicity of parts. Thus did the author of the Cypria\nand of the Little Iliad. For this reason the Iliad and the Odyssey\neach furnish the subject of one tragedy, or, at most, of two; while the\nCypria supplies materials for many, and the Little Iliad for eight--the\nAward of the Arms, the Philoctetes, the Neoptolemus, the Eurypylus, the\nMendicant Odysseus, the Laconian Women, the Fall of Ilium, the Departure\nof the Fleet.\nXXIV\nAgain, Epic poetry must have as many kinds as Tragedy: it must be\nsimple, or complex, or 'ethical,' or 'pathetic.' The parts also, with\nthe exception of song and spectacle, are the same; for it requires\nReversals of the Situation, Recognitions, and Scenes of Suffering.\nMoreover, the thoughts and the diction must be artistic. In all these\nrespects Homer is our earliest and sufficient model. Indeed each of\nhis poems has a twofold character. The Iliad is at once simple and\n'pathetic,' and the Odyssey complex (for Recognition scenes run through\nit), and at the same time 'ethical.' Moreover, in diction and thought\nthey are supreme.\nEpic poetry differs from Tragedy in the scale on which it is\nconstructed, and in its metre. As regards scale or length, we have\nalready laid down an adequate limit:--the beginning and the end must be\ncapable of being brought within a single view. This condition will be\nsatisfied by poems on a smaller scale than the old epics, and answering\nin length to the group of tragedies presented at a single sitting.\nEpic poetry has, however, a great--a special--capacity for enlarging\nits dimensions, and we can see the reason. In Tragedy we cannot imitate\nseveral lines of actions carried on at one and the same time; we must\nconfine ourselves to the action on the stage and the part taken by the\nplayers. But in Epic poetry, owing to the narrative form, many events\nsimultaneously transacted can be presented; and these, if relevant to\nthe subject, add mass and dignity to the poem. The Epic has here an\nadvantage, and one that conduces to grandeur of effect, to diverting the\nmind of the hearer, and relieving the story with varying episodes. For\nsameness of incident soon produces satiety, and makes tragedies fail on\nthe stage.\nAs for the metre, the heroic measure has proved its fitness by the test\nof experience. If a narrative poem in any other metre or in many metres\nwere now composed, it would be found incongruous. For of all measures\nthe heroic is the stateliest and the most massive; and hence it most\nreadily admits rare words and metaphors, which is another point in which\nthe narrative form of imitation stands alone. On the other hand, the\niambic and the trochaic tetrameter are stirring measures, the latter\nbeing akin to dancing, the former expressive of action. Still more\nabsurd would it be to mix together different metres, as was done by\nChaeremon. Hence no one has ever composed a poem on a great scale in any\nother than heroic verse. Nature herself, as we have said, teaches the\nchoice of the proper measure.\nHomer, admirable in all respects, has the special merit of being the\nonly poet who rightly appreciates the part he should take himself. The\npoet should speak as little as possible in his own person, for it is not\nthis that makes him an imitator. Other poets appear themselves upon the\nscene throughout, and imitate but little and rarely. Homer, after a few\nprefatory words, at once brings in a man, or woman, or other personage;\nnone of them wanting in characteristic qualities, but each with a\ncharacter of his own.\nThe element of the wonderful is required in Tragedy. The irrational, on\nwhich the wonderful depends for its chief effects, has wider scope in\nEpic poetry, because there the person acting is not seen. Thus, the\npursuit of Hector would be ludicrous if placed upon the stage--the\nGreeks standing still and not joining in the pursuit, and Achilles\nwaving them back. But in the Epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed.\nNow the wonderful is pleasing: as may be inferred from the fact that\nevery one tells a story with some addition of his own, knowing that his\nhearers like it. It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the\nart of telling lies skilfully. The secret of it lies in a fallacy, For,\nassuming that if one thing is or becomes, a second is or becomes, men\nimagine that, if the second is, the first likewise is or becomes. But\nthis is a false inference. Hence, where the first thing is untrue, it is\nquite unnecessary, provided the second be true, to add that the first\nis or has become. For the mind, knowing the second to be true, falsely\ninfers the truth of the first. There is an example of this in the Bath\nScene of the Odyssey.\nAccordingly, the poet should prefer probable impossibilities to\nimprobable possibilities. The tragic plot must not be composed of\nirrational parts. Everything irrational should, if possible, be\nexcluded; or, at all events, it should lie outside the action of the\nplay (as, in the Oedipus, the hero's ignorance as to the manner of\nLaius' death); not within the drama,--as in the Electra, the messenger's\naccount of the Pythian games; or, as in the Mysians, the man who\nhas come from Tegea to Mysia and is still speechless. The plea that\notherwise the plot would have been ruined, is ridiculous; such a plot\nshould not in the first instance be constructed. But once the irrational\nhas been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it, we must\naccept it in spite of the absurdity. Take even the irrational incidents\nin the Odyssey, where Odysseus is left upon the shore of Ithaca. How\nintolerable even these might have been would be apparent if an inferior\npoet were to treat the subject. As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the\npoetic charm with which the poet invests it.\nThe diction should be elaborated in the pauses of the action, where\nthere is no expression of character or thought. For, conversely,\ncharacter and thought are merely obscured by a diction that is over\nbrilliant.\nXXV\nWith respect to critical difficulties and their solutions, the number\nand nature of the sources from which they may be drawn may be thus\nexhibited.\nThe poet being an imitator, like a painter or any other artist, must\nof necessity imitate one of three objects,--things as they were or are,\nthings as they are said or thought to be, or things as they ought to be.\nThe vehicle of expression is language,--either current terms or, it\nmay be, rare words or metaphors. There are also many modifications of\nlanguage, which we concede to the poets. Add to this, that the standard\nof correctness is not the same in poetry and politics, any more than in\npoetry and any other art. Within the art of poetry itself there are\ntwo kinds of faults, those which touch its essence, and those which are\naccidental. If a poet has chosen to imitate something, <but has imitated\nit incorrectly> through want of capacity, the error is inherent in\nthe poetry. But if the failure is due to a wrong choice if he has\nrepresented a horse as throwing out both his off legs at once, or\nintroduced technical inaccuracies in medicine, for example, or in any\nother art the error is not essential to the poetry. These are the points\nof view from which we should consider and answer the objections raised\nby the critics.\nFirst as to matters which concern the poet's own art. If he describes\nthe impossible, he is guilty of an error; but the error may be\njustified, if the end of the art be thereby attained (the end being that\nalready mentioned), if, that is, the effect of this or any other part of\nthe poem is thus rendered more striking. A case in point is the pursuit\nof Hector. If, however, the end might have been as well, or better,\nattained without violating the special rules of the poetic art, the\nerror is not justified: for every kind of error should, if possible, be\navoided.\nAgain, does the error touch the essentials of the poetic art, or some\naccident of it? For example,--not to know that a hind has no horns is a\nless serious matter than to paint it inartistically.\nFurther, if it be objected that the description is not true to fact, the\npoet may perhaps reply,--'But the objects are as they ought to be': just\nas Sophocles said that he drew men as they ought to be; Euripides,\nas they are. In this way the objection may be met. If, however, the\nrepresentation be of neither kind, the poet may answer,--This is how men\nsay the thing is.' This applies to tales about the gods. It may well be\nthat these stories are not higher than fact nor yet true to fact: they\nare, very possibly, what Xenophanes says of them. But anyhow, 'this\nis what is said.' Again, a description may be no better than the fact:\n'still, it was the fact'; as in the passage about the arms: 'Upright\nupon their butt-ends stood the spears.' This was the custom then, as it\nnow is among the Illyrians.\nAgain, in examining whether what has been said or done by some one is\npoetically right or not, we must not look merely to the particular act\nor saying, and ask whether it is poetically good or bad. We must also\nconsider by whom it is said or done, to whom, when, by what means, or\nfor what end; whether, for instance, it be to secure a greater good, or\navert a greater evil.\nOther difficulties may be resolved by due regard to the usage of\nlanguage. We may note a rare word, as in {omicron upsilon rho eta alpha\nsigma / mu epsilon nu / pi rho omega tau omicron nu}, where the poet\nperhaps employs {omicron upsilon rho eta alpha sigma} not in the sense\nof mules, but of sentinels. So, again, of Dolon: 'ill-favoured indeed\nhe was to look upon.' It is not meant that his body was ill-shaped, but\nthat his face was ugly; for the Cretans use the word {epsilon upsilon\nepsilon iota delta epsilon sigma}, 'well-favoured,' to denote a fair\nface. Again, {zeta omega rho omicron tau epsilon rho omicron nu /\ndelta epsilon / kappa epsilon rho alpha iota epsilon}, 'mix the drink\nlivelier,' does not mean `mix it stronger' as for hard drinkers, but\n'mix it quicker.'\nSometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men were\nsleeping through the night,'--while at the same time the poet says:\n'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marvelled\nat the sound of flutes and pipes.' 'All' is here used metaphorically for\n'many,' all being a species of many. So in the verse,--'alone she hath\nno part...,' {omicron iota eta}, 'alone,' is metaphorical; for the best\nknown may be called the only one.\nAgain, the solution may depend upon accent or breathing. Thus Hippias of\nThasos solved the difficulties in the lines,--{delta iota delta omicron\nmu epsilon nu (delta iota delta omicron mu epsilon nu) delta epsilon\n/ omicron iota,} and { tau omicron / mu epsilon nu / omicron upsilon\n(omicron upsilon) kappa alpha tau alpha pi upsilon theta epsilon tau\nalpha iota / omicron mu beta rho omega}.\nOr again, the question may be solved by punctuation, as in\nEmpedocles,--'Of a sudden things became mortal that before had learnt to\nbe immortal, and things unmixed before mixed.'\nOr again, by ambiguity of meaning,--as {pi alpha rho omega chi eta kappa\nepsilon nu / delta epsilon / pi lambda epsilon omega / nu upsilon xi},\nwhere the word {pi lambda epsilon omega} is ambiguous.\nOr by the usage of language. Thus any mixed drink is called {omicron\niota nu omicron sigma}, 'wine.' Hence Ganymede is said 'to pour the wine\nto Zeus,' though the gods do not drink wine. So too workers in iron\nare called {chi alpha lambda kappa epsilon alpha sigma}, or workers in\nbronze. This, however, may also be taken as a metaphor.\nAgain, when a word seems to involve some inconsistency of meaning, we\nshould consider how many senses it may bear in the particular passage.\nFor example: 'there was stayed the spear of bronze'--we should ask\nin how many ways we may take 'being checked there.' The true mode\nof interpretation is the precise opposite of what Glaucon mentions.\nCritics, he says, jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass\nadverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that\nthe poet has said whatever they happen to think, find fault if a thing\nis inconsistent with their own fancy. The question about Icarius\nhas been treated in this fashion. The critics imagine he was a\nLacedaemonian. They think it strange, therefore, that Telemachus should\nnot have met him when he went to Lacedaemon. But the Cephallenian story\nmay perhaps be the true one. They allege that Odysseus took a wife from\namong themselves, and that her father was Icadius not Icarius. It is\nmerely a mistake, then, that gives plausibility to the objection.\nIn general, the impossible must be justified by reference to artistic\nrequirements, or to the higher reality, or to received opinion. With\nrespect to the requirements of art, a probable impossibility is to\nbe preferred to a thing improbable and yet possible. Again, it may be\nimpossible that there should be men such as Zeuxis painted. 'Yes,' we\nsay, 'but the impossible is the higher thing; for the ideal type must\nsurpass the reality.' To justify the irrational, we appeal to what is\ncommonly said to be. In addition to which, we urge that the irrational\nsometimes does not violate reason; just as 'it is probable that a thing\nmay happen contrary to probability.'\nThings that sound contradictory should be examined by the same rules as\nin dialectical refutation whether the same thing is meant, in the same\nrelation, and in the same sense. We should therefore solve the question\nby reference to what the poet says himself, or to what is tacitly\nassumed by a person of intelligence.\nThe element of the irrational, and, similarly, depravity of character,\nare justly censured when there is no inner necessity for introducing\nthem. Such is the irrational element in the introduction of Aegeus by\nEuripides and the badness of Menelaus in the Orestes.\nThus, there are five sources from which critical objections are drawn.\nThings are censured either as impossible, or irrational, or morally\nhurtful, or contradictory, or contrary to artistic correctness. The\nanswers should be sought under the twelve heads above mentioned.\nXXVI\nThe question may be raised whether the Epic or Tragic mode of imitation\nis the higher. If the more refined art is the higher, and the more\nrefined in every case is that which appeals to the better sort of\naudience, the art which imitates anything and everything is manifestly\nmost unrefined. The audience is supposed to be too dull to comprehend\nunless something of their own is thrown in by the performers, who\ntherefore indulge in restless movements. Bad flute-players twist and\ntwirl, if they have to represent 'the quoit-throw,' or hustle the\ncoryphaeus when they perform the 'Scylla.' Tragedy, it is said, has\nthis same defect. We may compare the opinion that the older actors\nentertained of their successors. Mynniscus used to call Callippides\n'ape' on account of the extravagance of his action, and the same view\nwas held of Pindarus. Tragic art, then, as a whole, stands to Epic in\nthe same relation as the younger to the elder actors. So we are told\nthat Epic poetry is addressed to a cultivated audience, who do not need\ngesture; Tragedy, to an inferior public. Being then unrefined, it is\nevidently the lower of the two.\nNow, in the first place, this censure attaches not to the poetic but to\nthe histrionic art; for gesticulation may be equally overdone in\nepic recitation, as by Sosi-stratus, or in lyrical competition, as by\nMnasitheus the Opuntian. Next, all action is not to be condemned any\nmore than all dancing--but only that of bad performers. Such was the\nfault found in Callippides, as also in others of our own day, who are\ncensured for representing degraded women. Again, Tragedy like Epic\npoetry produces its effect even without action; it reveals its power\nby mere reading. If, then, in all other respects it is superior, this\nfault, we say, is not inherent in it.\nAnd superior it is, because it has all the epic elements--it may even\nuse the epic metre--with the music and spectacular effects as important\naccessories; and these produce the most vivid of pleasures. Further,\nit has vividness of impression in reading as well as in representation.\nMoreover, the art attains its end within narrower limits; for the\nconcentrated effect is more pleasurable than one which is spread over a\nlong time and so diluted. What, for example, would be the effect of the\nOedipus of Sophocles, if it were cast into a form as long as the Iliad?\nOnce more, the Epic imitation has less unity; as is shown by this, that\nany Epic poem will furnish subjects for several tragedies. Thus if\nthe story adopted by the poet has a strict unity, it must either be\nconcisely told and appear truncated; or, if it conform to the Epic canon\nof length, it must seem weak and watery. <Such length implies some loss\nof unity,> if, I mean, the poem is constructed out of several actions,\nlike the Iliad and the Odyssey, which have many such parts, each with a\ncertain magnitude of its own. Yet these poems are as perfect as possible\nin structure; each is, in the highest degree attainable, an imitation of\na single action.\nIf, then, Tragedy is superior to Epic poetry in all these respects, and,\nmoreover, fulfils its specific function better as an art for each art\nought to produce, not any chance pleasure, but the pleasure proper to\nit, as already stated it plainly follows that Tragedy is the higher art,\nas attaining its end more perfectly.\nThus much may suffice concerning Tragic and Epic poetry in general;\ntheir several kinds and parts, with the number of each and their\ndifferences; the causes that make a poem good or bad; the objections of\nthe critics and the answers to these objections.", "source": "poetics.txt"}
{"text": "Introduction by J. A. Smith\nContents\nINTRODUCTION\nARISTOTLE\u2019S ETHICS\nBOOK I\nBOOK II\nBOOK III\nBOOK IV\nBOOK V\nBOOK VI\nBOOK VII\nBOOK VIII\nBOOK IX\nBOOK X\nNOTES\nINTRODUCTION\nThe _Ethics_ of Aristotle is one half of a single treatise of which his\n_Politics_ is the other half. Both deal with one and the same subject.\nThis subject is what Aristotle calls in one place the \u201cphilosophy of\nhuman affairs;\u201d but more frequently Political or Social Science. In the\ntwo works taken together we have their author\u2019s whole theory of human\nconduct or practical activity, that is, of all human activity which is\nnot directed merely to knowledge or truth. The two parts of this\ntreatise are mutually complementary, but in a literary sense each is\nindependent and self-contained. The proem to the _Ethics_ is an\nintroduction to the whole subject, not merely to the first part; the\nlast chapter of the _Ethics_ points forward to the _Politics_, and\nsketches for that part of the treatise the order of enquiry to be\npursued (an order which in the actual treatise is not adhered to).\nThe principle of distribution of the subject-matter between the two\nworks is far from obvious, and has been much debated. Not much can be\ngathered from their titles, which in any case were not given to them by\ntheir author. Nor do these titles suggest any very compact unity in the\nworks to which they are applied: the plural forms, which survive so\noddly in English (Ethic_s_, Politic_s_), were intended to indicate the\ntreatment within a single work of a _group_ of connected questions. The\nunity of the first group arises from their centring round the topic of\ncharacter, that of the second from their connection with the existence\nand life of the city or state. We have thus to regard the _Ethics_ as\ndealing with one group of problems and the _Politics_ with a second,\nboth falling within the wide compass of Political Science. Each of\nthese groups falls into sub-groups which roughly correspond to the\nseveral books in each work. The tendency to take up one by one the\nvarious problems which had suggested themselves in the wide field\nobscures both the unity of the subject-matter and its proper\narticulation. But it is to be remembered that what is offered us is\navowedly rather an enquiry than an exposition of hard and fast\ndoctrine.\nNevertheless each work aims at a relative completeness, and it is\nimportant to observe the relation of each to the other. The distinction\nis not that the one treats of Moral and the other of Political\nPhilosophy, nor again that the one deals with the moral activity of the\nindividual and the other with that of the State, nor once more that the\none gives us the theory of human conduct, while the other discusses its\napplication in practice, though not all of these misinterpretations are\nequally erroneous. The clue to the right interpretation is given by\nAristotle himself, where in the last chapter of the _Ethics_ he is\npaving the way for the _Politics_. In the _Ethics_ he has not confined\nhimself to the abstract or isolated individual, but has always thought\nof him, or we might say, in his social and political context, with a\ngiven nature due to race and heredity and in certain surroundings. So\nviewing him he has studied the nature and formation of his\ncharacter\u2014all that he can make himself or be made by others to be.\nEspecially he has investigated the various admirable forms of human\ncharacter and the mode of their production. But all this, though it\nbrings more clearly before us what goodness or virtue is, and how it is\nto be reached, remains mere theory or talk. By itself it does not\nenable us to become, or to help others to become, good. For this it is\nnecessary to bring into play the great force of the Political Community\nor State, of which the main instrument is Law. Hence arises the demand\nfor the necessary complement to the _Ethics, i.e._, a treatise devoted\nto the questions which centre round the enquiry; by what organisation\nof social or political forces, by what laws or institutions can we best\nsecure the greatest amount of good character?\nWe must, however, remember that the production of good character is not\nthe end of either individual or state action: that is the aim of the\none and the other because good character is the indispensable condition\nand chief determinant of happiness, itself the goal of all human doing.\nThe end of all action, individual or collective, is the greatest\nhappiness of the greatest number. There is, Aristotle insists, no\ndifference of kind between the good of one and the good of many or all.\nThe sole difference is one of amount or scale. This does not mean\nsimply that the State exists to secure in larger measure the objects of\ndegree which the isolated individual attempts, but is too feeble, to\nsecure without it. On the contrary, it rather insists that whatever\ngoods society alone enables a man to secure have always had to the\nindividual\u2014whether he realised it or not\u2014the value which, when so\nsecured, he recognises them to possess. The best and happiest life for\nthe individual is that which the State renders possible, and this it\ndoes mainly by revealing to him the value of new objects of desire and\neducating him to appreciate them. To Aristotle or to Plato the State\nis, above all, a large and powerful educative agency which gives the\nindividual increased opportunities of self-development and greater\ncapacities for the enjoyment of life.\nLooking forward, then, to the life of the State as that which aids\nsupport, and combines the efforts of the individual to obtain\nhappiness, Aristotle draws no hard and fast distinction between the\nspheres of action of Man as individual and Man as citizen. Nor does the\ndivision of his discussion into the _Ethics_ and the _Politics_ rest\nupon any such distinction. The distinction implied is rather between\ntwo stages in the life of the civilised man\u2014the stage of preparation\nfor the full life of the adult citizen, and the stage of the actual\nexercise or enjoyment of citizenship. Hence the _Ethics_, where his\nattention is directed upon the formation of character, is largely and\ncentrally a treatise on Moral Education. It discusses especially those\nadmirable human qualities which fit a man for life in an organised\ncivic community, which makes him \u201ca good citizen,\u201d and considers how\nthey can be fostered or created and their opposites prevented.\nThis is the kernel of the _Ethics_, and all the rest is subordinate to\nthis main interest and purpose. Yet \u201cthe rest\u201d is not irrelevant; the\nwhole situation in which character grows and operates is concretely\nconceived. There is a basis of what we should call Psychology, sketched\nin firm outlines, the deeper presuppositions and the wider issues of\nhuman character and conduct are not ignored, and there is no little of\nwhat we should call Metaphysics. But neither the Psychology nor the\nMetaphysics is elaborated, and only so much is brought forward as\nappears necessary to put the main facts in their proper perspective and\nsetting. It is this combination of width of outlook with close\nobservation of the concrete facts of conduct which gives its abiding\nvalue to the work, and justifies the view of it as containing\nAristotle\u2019s Moral Philosophy. Nor is it important merely as summing up\nthe moral judgments and speculations of an age now long past. It seizes\nand dwells upon those elements and features in human practice which are\nmost essential and permanent, and it is small wonder that so much in it\nsurvives in our own ways of regarding conduct and speaking of it. Thus\nit still remains one of the classics of Moral Philosophy, nor is its\nvalue likely soon to be exhausted.\nAs was pointed out above, the proem (Book I., cc. i-iii.) is a prelude\nto the treatment of the whole subject covered by the _Ethics_ and the\n_Politics_ together. It sets forth the purpose of the enquiry,\ndescribes the spirit in which it is to be undertaken and what ought to\nbe the expectation of the reader, and lastly states the necessary\nconditions of studying it with profit. The aim of it is the acquisition\nand propagation of a certain kind of knowledge (science), but this\nknowledge and the thinking which brings it about are subsidiary to a\npractical end. The knowledge aimed at is of what is best for man and of\nthe conditions of its realisation. Such knowledge is that which in its\nconsumate form we find in great statesmen, enabling them to organise\nand administer their states and regulate by law the life of the\ncitizens to their advantage and happiness, but it is the same kind of\nknowledge which on a smaller scale secures success in the management of\nthe family or of private life.\nIt is characteristic of such knowledge that it should be deficient in\n\u201cexactness,\u201d in precision of statement, and closeness of logical\nconcatenation. We must not look for a mathematics of conduct. The\nsubject-matter of Human Conduct is not governed by necessary and\nuniform laws. But this does not mean that it is subject to no laws.\nThere are general principles at work in it, and these can be formulated\nin \u201crules,\u201d which rules can be systematised or unified. It is\nall-important to remember that practical or moral rules are only\ngeneral and always admit of exceptions, and that they arise not from\nthe mere complexity of the facts, but from the liability of the facts\nto a certain unpredictable variation. At their very best, practical\nrules state probabilities, not certainties; a relative constancy of\nconnection is all that exists, but it is enough to serve as a guide in\nlife. Aristotle here holds the balance between a misleading hope of\nreducing the subject-matter of conduct to a few simple rigorous\nabstract principles, with conclusions necessarily issuing from them,\nand the view that it is the field of operation of inscrutable forces\nacting without predictable regularity. He does not pretend to find in\nit absolute uniformities, or to deduce the details from his principles.\nHence, too, he insists on the necessity of experience as the source or\ntest of all that he has to say. Moral experience\u2014the actual possession\nand exercise of good character\u2014is necessary truly to understand moral\nprinciples and profitably to apply them. The mere intellectual\napprehension of them is not possible, or if possible, profitless.\nThe _Ethics_ is addressed to students who are presumed both to have\nenough general education to appreciate these points, and also to have a\nsolid foundation of good habits. More than that is not required for the\nprofitable study of it.\nIf the discussion of the nature and formation of character be regarded\nas the central topic of the _Ethics_, the contents of Book I., cc.\niv.-xii. may be considered as still belonging to the introduction and\nsetting, but these chapters contain matter of profound importance and\nhave exercised an enormous influence upon subsequent thought. They lay\ndown a principle which governs all Greek thought about human life, viz.\nthat it is only intelligible when viewed as directed towards some end\nor good. This is the Greek way of expressing that all human life\ninvolves an ideal element\u2014something which it is not yet and which under\ncertain conditions it is to be. In that sense Greek Moral Philosophy is\nessentially idealistic. Further it is always assumed that all human\npractical activity is directed or \u201coriented\u201d to a _single_ end, and\nthat that end is knowable or definable in advance of its realisation.\nTo know it is not merely a matter of speculative interest, it is of the\nhighest practical moment for only in the light of it can life be duly\nguided, and particularly only so can the state be properly organised\nand administered. This explains the stress laid throughout by Greek\nMoral Philosophy upon the necessity of knowledge as a condition of the\nbest life. This knowledge is not, though it includes knowledge of the\nnature of man and his circumstances, it is knowledge of what is best\u2014of\nman\u2019s supreme end or good.\nBut this end is not conceived as presented to him by a superior power\nnor even as something which _ought_ to be. The presentation of the\nMoral Ideal as Duty is almost absent. From the outset it is identified\nwith the object of desire, of what we not merely judge desirable but\nactually do desire, or that which would, if realised, satisfy human\ndesire. In fact it is what we all, wise and simple, agree in naming\n\u201cHappiness\u201d (Welfare or Well-being)\nIn what then does happiness consist? Aristotle summarily sets aside the\nmore or less popular identifications of it with abundance of physical\npleasures, with political power and honour, with the mere possession of\nsuch superior gifts or attainments as normally entitle men to these,\nwith wealth. None of these can constitute the end or good of man as\nsuch. On the other hand, he rejects his master Plato\u2019s conception of a\ngood which is the end of the whole universe, or at least dismisses it\nas irrelevant to his present enquiry. The good towards which all human\ndesires and practical activities are directed must be one conformable\nto man\u2019s special nature and circumstances and attainable by his\nefforts. There is in Aristotle\u2019s theory of human conduct no trace of\nPlato\u2019s \u201cother worldliness\u201d, he brings the moral ideal in Bacon\u2019s\nphrase down to \u201cright earth\u201d\u2014and so closer to the facts and problems of\nactual human living. Turning from criticism of others he states his own\npositive view of Happiness, and, though he avowedly states it merely in\noutline his account is pregnant with significance. Human Happiness lies\nin activity or energising, and that in a way peculiar to man with his\ngiven nature and his given circumstances, it is not theoretical, but\npractical: it is the activity not of reason but still of a being who\npossesses reason and applies it, and it presupposes in that being the\ndevelopment, and not merely the natural possession, of certain relevant\npowers and capacities. The last is the prime condition of successful\nliving and therefore of satisfaction, but Aristotle does not ignore\nother conditions, such as length of life, wealth and good luck, the\nabsence or diminution of which render happiness not impossible, but\ndifficult of attainment.\nIt is interesting to compare this account of Happiness with Mill\u2019s in\n_Utilitarianism_. Mill\u2019s is much the less consistent: at times he\ndistinguishes and at times he identifies, happiness, pleasure,\ncontentment, and satisfaction. He wavers between belief in its general\nattainability and an absence of hopefulness. He mixes up in an\narbitrary way such ingredients as \u201cnot expecting more from life than it\nis capable of bestowing,\u201d \u201cmental cultivation,\u201d \u201cimproved laws,\u201d etc.,\nand in fact leaves the whole conception vague, blurred, and uncertain.\nAristotle draws the outline with a firmer hand and presents a more\ndefinite ideal. He allows for the influence on happiness of conditions\nonly partly, if at all, within the control of man, but he clearly makes\nthe man positive determinant of man\u2019s happiness he in himself, and more\nparticularly in what he makes directly of his own nature, and so\nindirectly of his circumstances. \u201c\u2018Tis in ourselves that we are thus or\nthus\u201d But once more this does not involve an artificial or abstract\nisolation of the individual moral agent from his relation to other\npersons or things from his context in society and nature, nor ignore\nthe relative dependence of his life upon a favourable environment.\nThe main factor which determines success or failure in human life is\nthe acquisition of certain powers, for Happiness is just the exercise\nor putting forth of these in actual living, everything else is\nsecondary and subordinate. These powers arise from the due development\nof certain natural aptitudes which belong (in various degrees) to human\nnature as such and therefore to all normal human beings. In their\ndeveloped form they are known as virtues (the Greek means simply\n\u201cgoodnesses,\u201d \u201cperfections,\u201d \u201cexcellences,\u201d or \u201cfitnesses\u201d), some of\nthem are physical, but others are psychical, and among the latter some,\nand these distinctively or peculiarly human, are \u201crational,\u201d _i e_,\npresuppose the possession and exercise of mind or intelligence. These\nlast fall into two groups, which Aristotle distinguishes as Goodnesses\nof Intellect and Goodnesses of Character. They have in common that they\nall excite in us admiration and praise of their possessors, and that\nthey are not natural endowments, but acquired characteristics But they\ndiffer in important ways. (1) the former are excellences or developed\npowers of the reason as such\u2014of that in us which sees and formulates\nlaws, rules, regularities systems, and is content in the vision of\nthem, while the latter involve a submission or obedience to such rules\nof something in us which is in itself capricious and irregular, but\ncapable of regulation, viz our instincts and feelings, (2) the former\nare acquired by study and instruction, the latter by discipline. The\nlatter constitute \u201ccharacter,\u201d each of them as a \u201cmoral virtue\u201d\n(literally \u201ca goodness of character\u201d), and upon them primarily depends\nthe realisation of happiness. This is the case at least for the great\nmajority of men, and for all men their possession is an indispensable\nbasis of the best, _i e_, the most desirable life. They form the chief\nor central subject-matter of the _Ethics_.\nPerhaps the truest way of conceiving Aristotle\u2019s meaning here is to\nregard a moral virtue as a form of obedience to a maxim or rule of\nconduct accepted by the agent as valid for a class of recurrent\nsituations in human life. Such obedience requires knowledge of the rule\nand acceptance of it _as the rule_ of the agent\u2019s own actions, but not\nnecessarily knowledge of its ground or of its systematic connexion with\nother similarly known and similarly accepted rules (It may be remarked\nthat the Greek word usually translated \u201creason,\u201d means in almost all\ncases in the _Ethics_ such a rule, and not the faculty which\napprehends, formulates, considers them).\nThe \u201cmoral virtues and vices\u201d make up what we call character, and the\nimportant questions arise: (1) What is character? and (2) How is it\nformed? (for character in this sense is not a natural endowment; it is\nformed or produced). Aristotle deals with these questions in the\nreverse order. His answers are peculiar and distinctive\u2014not that they\nare absolutely novel (for they are anticipated in Plato), but that by\nhim they are for the first time distinctly and clearly formulated.\n(1.) Character, good or bad, is produced by what Aristotle calls\n\u201chabituation,\u201d that is, it is the result of the repeated doing of acts\nwhich have a similar or common quality. Such repetition acting upon\nnatural aptitudes or propensities gradually fixes them in one or other\nof two opposite directions, giving them a bias towards good or evil.\nHence the several acts which determine goodness or badness of character\nmust be done in a certain way, and thus the formation of good character\nrequires discipline and direction from without. Not that the agent\nhimself contributes nothing to the formation of his character, but that\nat first he needs guidance. The point is not so much that the process\ncannot be safely left to Nature, but that it cannot be entrusted to\nmerely intellectual instruction. The process is one of assimilation,\nlargely by imitation and under direction and control. The result is a\ngrowing understanding of what is done, a choice of it for its own sake,\na fixity and steadiness of purpose. Right acts and feelings become,\nthrough habit, easier and more pleasant, and the doing of them a\n\u201csecond nature.\u201d The agent acquires the power of doing them freely,\nwillingly, more and more \u201cof himself.\u201d\nBut what are \u201cright\u201d acts? In the first place, they are those that\nconform to a rule\u2014to the right rule, and ultimately to reason. The\nGreeks never waver from the conviction that in the end moral conduct is\nessentially reasonable conduct. But there is a more significant way of\ndescribing their \u201crightness,\u201d and here for the first time Aristotle\nintroduces his famous \u201cDoctrine of the Mean.\u201d Reasoning from the\nanalogy of \u201cright\u201d physical acts, he pronounces that rightness always\nmeans adaptation or adjustment to the special requirements of a\nsituation. To this adjustment he gives a quantitative interpretation.\nTo do (or to feel) what is right in a given situation is to do or to\nfeel just the amount required\u2014neither more nor less: to do wrong is to\ndo or to feel too much or too little\u2014to fall short of or over-shoot, \u201ca\nmean\u201d determined by the situation. The repetition of acts which lie in\nthe mean is the cause of the formation of each and every \u201cgoodness of\ncharacter,\u201d and for this \u201crules\u201d can be given.\n(2) What then is a \u201cmoral virtue,\u201d the result of such a process duly\ndirected? It is no mere mood of feeling, no mere liability to emotion,\nno mere natural aptitude or endowment, it is a permanent _state_ of the\nagent\u2019s self, or, as we might in modern phrase put it, of his will, it\nconsists in a steady self-imposed obedience to a rule of action in\ncertain situations which frequently recur in human life. The rule\nprescribes the control and regulation within limits of the agent\u2019s\nnatural impulses to act and feel thus and thus. The situations fall\ninto groups which constitute the \u201cfields\u201d of the several \u201cmoral\nvirtues\u201d, for each there is a rule, conformity to which secures\nrightness in the individual acts. Thus the moral ideal appears as a\ncode of rules, accepted by the agent, but as yet _to him_ without\nrational justification and without system or unity. But the rules\nprescribe no mechanical uniformity: each within its limits permits\nvariety, and the exactly right amount adopted to the requirements of\nthe individual situation (and every actual situation is individual)\nmust be determined by the intuition of the moment. There is no attempt\nto reduce the rich possibilities of right action to a single monotonous\ntype. On the contrary, there are acknowledged to be many forms of moral\nvirtue, and there is a long list of them, with their correlative vices\nenumerated.\nThe Doctrine of the Mean here takes a form in which it has impressed\nsubsequent thinkers, but which has less importance than is usually\nascribed to it. In the \u201cTable of the Virtues and Vices,\u201d each of the\nvirtues is flanked by two opposite vices, which are respectively the\nexcess and defect of that which in due measure constitutes the virtue.\nAristotle tries to show that this is the case in regard to every virtue\nnamed and recognised as such, but his treatment is often forced and the\nendeavour is not very successful. Except as a convenient principle of\narrangement of the various forms of praiseworthy or blameworthy\ncharacters, generally acknowledged as such by Greek opinion, this form\nof the doctrine is of no great significance.\nBooks III-V are occupied with a survey of the moral virtues and vices.\nThese seem to have been undertaken in order to verify in detail the\ngeneral account, but this aim is not kept steadily in view. Nor is\nthere any well-considered principle of classification. What we find is\na sort of portrait-gallery of the various types of moral excellence\nwhich the Greeks of the author\u2019s age admired and strove to encourage.\nThe discussion is full of acute, interesting and sometimes profound\nobservations. Some of the types are those which are and will be admired\nat all times, but others are connected with peculiar features of Greek\nlife which have now passed away. The most important is that of Justice\nor the Just Man, to which we may later return. But the discussion is\npreceded by an attempt to elucidate some difficult and obscure points\nin the general account of moral virtue and action (Book III, cc i-v).\nThis section is concerned with the notion of Responsibility. The\ndiscussion designedly excludes what we may call the metaphysical issues\nof the problem, which here present themselves, it moves on the level of\nthought of the practical man, the statesman, and the legislator.\nCoercion and ignorance of relevant circumstances render acts\ninvoluntary and exempt their doer from responsibility, otherwise the\nact is voluntary and the agent responsible, choice or preference of\nwhat is done, and inner consent to the deed, are to be presumed.\nNeither passion nor ignorance of the right rule can extenuate\nresponsibility. But there is a difference between acts done voluntarily\nand acts done of _set_ choice or purpose. The latter imply\nDeliberation. Deliberation involves thinking, thinking out means to\nends: in deliberate acts the whole nature of the agent consents to and\nenters into the act, and in a peculiar sense they are his, they _are_\nhim in action, and the most significant evidence of what he is.\nAristotle is unable wholly to avoid allusion to the metaphysical\ndifficulties and what he does here say upon them is obscure and\nunsatisfactory. But he insists upon the importance in moral action of\nthe agent\u2019s inner consent, and on the reality of his individual\nresponsibility. For his present purpose the metaphysical difficulties\nare irrelevant.\nThe treatment of Justice in Book V has always been a source of great\ndifficulty to students of the _Ethics_. Almost more than any other part\nof the work it has exercised influence upon mediaeval and modern\nthought upon the subject. The distinctions and divisions have become\npart of the stock-in-trade of would be philosophic jurists. And yet,\noddly enough, most of these distinctions have been misunderstood and\nthe whole purport of the discussion misconceived. Aristotle is here\ndealing with justice in a restricted sense viz as that special goodness\nof character which is required of every adult citizen and which can be\nproduced by early discipline or habituation. It is the temper or\nhabitual attitude demanded of the citizen for the due exercise of his\nfunctions as taking part in the administration of the civic\ncommunity\u2014as a member of the judicature and executive. The Greek\ncitizen was only exceptionally, and at rare intervals if ever, a\nlaw-maker while at any moment he might be called upon to act as a judge\n(juryman or arbitrator) or as an administrator. For the work of a\nlegislator far more than the moral virtue of justice or fairmindedness\nwas necessary, these were requisite to the rarer and higher\n\u201cintellectual virtue\u201d of practical wisdom. Then here, too, the\ndiscussion moves on a low level, and the raising of fundamental\nproblems is excluded. Hence \u201cdistributive justice\u201d is concerned not\nwith the large question of the distribution of political power and\nprivileges among the constituent members or classes of the state but\nwith the smaller questions of the distribution among those of casual\ngains and even with the division among private claimants of a common\nfund or inheritance, while \u201ccorrective justice\u201d is concerned solely\nwith the management of legal redress. The whole treatment is confused\nby the unhappy attempt to give a precise mathematical form to the\nprinciples of justice in the various fields distinguished. Still it\nremains an interesting first endeavour to give greater exactness to\nsome of the leading conceptions of jurisprudence.\nBook VI appears to have in view two aims: (1) to describe goodness of\nintellect and discover its highest form or forms; (2) to show how this\nis related to goodness of character, and so to conduct generally. As\nall thinking is either theoretical or practical, goodness of intellect\nhas _two_ supreme forms\u2014Theoretical and Practical Wisdom. The first,\nwhich apprehends the eternal laws of the universe, has no direct\nrelation to human conduct: the second is identical with that master\nscience of human life of which the whole treatise, consisting of the\n_Ethics_ and the _Politics_, is an exposition. It is this science which\nsupplies the right rules of conduct Taking them as they emerge in and\nfrom practical experience, it formulates them more precisely and\norganises them into a system where they are all seen to converge upon\nhappiness. The mode in which such knowledge manifests itself is in the\npower to show that such and such rules of action follow from the very\nnature of the end or good for man. It presupposes and starts from a\nclear conception of the end and the wish for it as conceived, and it\nproceeds by a deduction which is dehberation writ large. In the man of\npractical wisdom this process has reached its perfect result, and the\ncode of right rules is apprehended as a system with a single principle\nand so as something wholly rational or reasonable He has not on each\noccasion to seek and find the right rule applicable to the situation,\nhe produces it at once from within himself, and can at need justify it\nby exhibiting its rationale, _i.e._ , its connection with the end. This\nis the consummate form of reason applied to conduct, but there are\nminor forms of it, less independent or original, but nevertheless of\ngreat value, such as the power to think out the proper cause of policy\nin novel circumstances or the power to see the proper line of treatment\nto follow in a court of law.\nThe form of the thinking which enters into conduct is that which\nterminates in the production of a rule which declares some means to the\nend of life. The process presupposes _(a)_ a clear and just\napprehension of the nature of that end\u2014such as the _Ethics_ itself\nendeavours to supply; _(b)_ a correct perception of the conditions of\naction, _(a)_ at least is impossible except to a man whose character\nhas been duly formed by discipline; it arises only in a man who has\nacquired moral virtue. For such action and feeling as forms bad\ncharacter, blinds the eye of the soul and corrupts the moral principle,\nand the place of practical wisdom is taken by that parody of itself\nwhich Aristotle calls \u201ccleverness\u201d\u2014the \u201cwisdom\u201d of the unscrupulous man\nof the world. Thus true practical wisdom and true goodness of character\nare interdependent; neither is genuinely possible or \u201ccompletely\u201d\npresent without the other. This is Aristotle\u2019s contribution to the\ndiscussion of the question, so central in Greek Moral Philosophy, of\nthe relation of the intellectual and the passionate factors in conduct.\nAristotle is not an intuitionist, but he recognises the implication in\nconduct of a direct and immediate apprehension both of the end and of\nthe character of his circumstances under which it is from moment to\nmoment realised. The directness of such apprehension makes it analogous\nto sensation or sense-perception; but it is on his view in the end due\nto the existence or activity in man of that power in him which is the\nhighest thing in his nature, and akin to or identical with the divine\nnature\u2014mind, or intelligence. It is this which reveals to us what is\nbest for us\u2014the ideal of a happiness which is the object of our real\nwish and the goal of all our efforts. But beyond and above the\npractical ideal of what is best _for man_ begins to show itself another\nand still higher ideal\u2014that of a life not distinctively human or in a\nnarrow sense practical, yet capable of being participated in by man\neven under the actual circumstances of this world. For a time, however,\nthis further and higher ideal is ignored.\nThe next book (Book VII.), is concerned partly with moral conditions,\nin which the agent seems to rise above the level of moral virtue or\nfall below that of moral vice, but partly and more largely with\nconditions in which the agent occupies a middle position between the\ntwo. Aristotle\u2019s attention is here directed chiefly towards the\nphenomena of \u201cIncontinence,\u201d weakness of will or imperfect\nself-control. This condition was to the Greeks a matter of only too\nfrequent experience, but it appeared to them peculiarly difficult to\nunderstand. How can a man know what is good or best for him, and yet\nchronically fail to act upon his knowledge? Socrates was driven to the\nparadox of denying the possibility, but the facts are too strong for\nhim. Knowledge of the right rule may be present, nay the rightfulness\nof its authority may be acknowledged, and yet time after time it may be\ndisobeyed; the will may be good and yet overmastered by the force of\ndesire, so that the act done is contrary to the agent\u2019s will.\nNevertheless the act may be the agent\u2019s, and the will therefore divided\nagainst itself. Aristotle is aware of the seriousness and difficulty of\nthe problem, but in spite of the vividness with which he pictures, and\nthe acuteness with which he analyses, the situation in which such\naction occurs, it cannot be said that he solves the problem. It is time\nthat he rises above the abstract view of it as a conflict between\nreason and passion, recognising that passion is involved in the\nknowledge which in conduct prevails or is overborne, and that the force\nwhich leads to the wrong act is not blind or ignorant passion, but\nalways has some reason in it. But he tends to lapse back into the\nabstraction, and his final account is perplexed and obscure. He finds\nthe source of the phenomenon in the nature of the desire for bodily\npleasures, which is not irrational but has something rational in it.\nSuch pleasures are not necessarily or inherently bad, as has sometimes\nbeen maintained; on the contrary, they are good, but only in certain\namounts or under certain conditions, so that the will is often misled,\nhesitates, and is lost.\nBooks VIII. and IX. (on Friendship) are almost an interruption of the\nargument. The subject-matter of them was a favourite topic of ancient\nwriters, and the treatment is smoother and more orderly than elsewhere\nin the _Ethics_. The argument is clear, and may be left without comment\nto the readers. These books contain a necessary and attractive\ncomplement to the somewhat dry account of Greek morality in the\npreceding books, and there are in them profound reflections on what may\nbe called the metaphysics of friendship or love.\nAt the beginning of Book X. we return to the topic of Pleasure, which\nis now regarded from a different point of view. In Book VII. the\nantagonists were those who over-emphasised the irrationality or badness\nof Pleasure: here it is rather those who so exaggerate its value as to\nconfuse or identify it with the good or Happiness. But there is offered\nus in this section much more than criticism of the errors of others.\nAnswers are given both to the psychological question, \u201cWhat is\nPleasure?\u201d and to the ethical question, \u201cWhat is its value?\u201d Pleasure,\nwe are told, is the natural concomitant and index of perfect activity,\ndistinguishable but inseparable from it\u2014\u201cthe activity of a subject at\nits best acting upon an object at its best.\u201d It is therefore always and\nin itself a good, but its value rises and falls with that of the\nactivity with which it is conjoined, and which it intensifies and\nperfects. Hence it follows that the highest and best pleasures are\nthose which accompany the highest and best activity.\nPleasure is, therefore, a necessary element in the best life, but it is\nnot the whole of it nor the principal ingredient. The value of a life\ndepends upon the nature and worth of the activity which it involves;\ngiven the maximum of full free action, the maximum of pleasure\nnecessary follows. But on what sort of life is such activity possible?\nThis leads us back to the question, What is happiness? In what life can\nman find the fullest satisfaction for his desires? To this question\nAristotle gives an answer which cannot but surprise us after what has\npreceded. True Happiness, great satisfaction, cannot be found by man in\nany form of \u201cpractical\u201d life, no, not in the fullest and freest\nexercise possible of the \u201cmoral virtues,\u201d not in the life of the\ncitizen or of the great soldier or statesman. To seek it there is to\ncourt failure and disappointment. It is to be found in the life of the\nonlooker, the disinterested spectator; or, to put it more distinctly,\n\u201cin the life of the philosopher, the life of scientific and philosophic\ncontemplation.\u201d The highest and most satisfying form of life possible\nto man is \u201cthe contemplative life\u201d; it is only in a secondary sense and\nfor those incapable of their life, that the practical or moral ideal is\nthe best. It is time that such a life is not distinctively human, but\nit is the privilege of man to partake in it, and such participation, at\nhowever rare intervals and for however short a period, is the highest\nHappiness which human life can offer. All other activities have value\nonly because and in so far as they render _this_ life possible.\nBut it must not be forgotten that Aristotle conceives of this life as\none of intense activity or energising: it is just this which gives it\nits supremacy. In spite of the almost religious fervour with which he\nspeaks of it (\u201cthe most orthodox of his disciples\u201d paraphrases his\nmeaning by describing its content as \u201cthe service and vision of God\u201d),\nit is clear that he identified it with the life of the philosopher, as\nhe understood it, a life of ceaseless intellectual activity in which at\nleast at times all the distractions and disturbances inseparable from\npractical life seemed to disappear and become as nothing. This ideal\nwas partly an inheritance from the more ardent idealism of his master\nPlato, but partly it was the expression of personal experience.\nThe nobility of this ideal cannot be questioned; the conception of the\nend of man or a life lived for truth\u2014of a life blissfully absorbed in\nthe vision of truth\u2014is a lofty and inspiring one. But we cannot resist\ncertain criticisms upon its presentation by Aristotle: (1) the relation\nof it to the lower ideal of practice is left somewhat obscure; (2) it\nis described in such a way as renders its realisation possible only to\na gifted few, and under exceptional circumstances; (3) it seems in\nvarious ways, as regards its content, to be unnecessarily and\nunjustifiably limited. But it must be borne in mind that this is a\nfirst endeavour to determine its principle, and that similar failures\nhave attended the attempts to describe the \u201creligious\u201d or the\n\u201cspiritual\u201d ideals of life, which have continually been suggested by\nthe apparently inherent limitations of the \u201cpractical\u201d or \u201cmoral\u201d life,\nwhich is the subject of Moral Philosophy.\nThe Moral Ideal to those who have most deeply reflected on it leads to\nthe thought of an Ideal beyond and above it, which alone gives it\nmeaning, but which seems to escape from definite conception by man. The\nrichness and variety of this Ideal ceaselessly invite, but as\nceaselessly defy, our attempts to imprison it in a definite formula or\nportray it in detailed imagination. Yet the thought of it is and\nremains inexpungable from our minds.\nThis conception of the best life is not forgotten in the _Politics_ The\nend of life in the state is itself well-living and well-doing\u2014a life\nwhich helps to produce the best life The great agency in the production\nof such life is the State operating through Law, which is Reason backed\nby Force. For its greatest efficiency there is required the development\nof a science of legislation. The main drift of what he says here is\nthat the most desirable thing would be that the best reason of the\ncommunity should be embodied in its laws. But so far as that is not\npossible, it still is true that anyone who would make himself and\nothers better must become a miniature legislator\u2014must study the general\nprinciples of law, morality, and education. The conception of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\nwith which he opened the _Ethics_ would serve as a guide to a father\neducating his children as well as to the legislator legislating for the\nstate. Finding in his predecessors no developed doctrine on this\nsubject, Aristotle proposes himself to undertake the construction of\nit, and sketches in advance the programme of the _Politics_ in the\nconcluding sentence of the _Ethics_ His ultimate object is to answer\nthe questions, What is the best form of Polity, how should each be\nconstituted, and what laws and customs should it adopt and employ? Not\ntill this answer is given will \u201cthe philosophy of human affairs\u201d be\ncomplete.\nOn looking back it will be seen that the discussion of the central\ntopic of the nature and formation of character has expanded into a\nPhilosophy of Human Conduct, merging at its beginning and end into\nmetaphysics The result is a Moral Philosophy set against a background\nof Political Theory and general Philosophy. The most characteristic\nfeatures of this Moral Philosophy are due to the fact of its\nessentially teleological view of human life and action: (1) Every human\nactivity, but especially every human practical activity, is directed\ntowards a simple End discoverable by reflection, and this End is\nconceived of as the object of universal human desire, as something to\nbe enjoyed, not as something which ought to be done or enacted.\nAnstotle\u2019s Moral Philosophy is not hedonistic but it is eud\u00e6momstic,\nthe end is the enjoyment of Happiness, not the fulfilment of Duty. (2)\nEvery human practical activity derives its value from its efficiency as\na means to that end, it is good or bad, right or wrong, as it conduces\nor fails to conduce to Happiness Thus his Moral Philosophy is\nessentially utilitarian or prudential Right action presupposes Thought\nor Thinking, partly on the development of a clearer and distincter\nconception of the end of desire, partly as the deduction from that of\nrules which state the normally effective conditions of its realisation.\nThe thinking involved in right conduct is calculation\u2014calculation of\nmeans to an end fixed by nature and foreknowable Action itself is at\nits best just the realisation of a scheme preconceived and thought out\nbeforehand, commending itself by its inherent attractiveness or promise\nof enjoyment.\nThis view has the great advantage of exhibiting morality as essentially\nreasonable, but the accompanying disadvantage of lowering it into a\nsomewhat prosaic and unideal Prudentialism, nor is it saved from this\nby the tacking on to it, by a sort of after-thought, of the second and\nhigher Ideal\u2014an addition which ruins the coherence of the account\nwithout really transmuting its substance The source of our\ndissatisfaction with the whole theory lies deeper than in its tendency\nto identify the end with the maximum of enjoyment or satisfaction, or\nto regard the goodness or badness of acts and feelings as lying solely\nin their efficacy to produce such a result It arises from the\napplication to morality of the distinction of means and end For this\ndistinction, for all its plausibility and usefulness in ordinary\nthought and speech, cannot finally be maintained In morality\u2014and this\nis vital to its character\u2014everything is both means and end, and so\nneither in distinction or separation, and all thinking about it which\npresupposes the finality of this distinction wanders into misconception\nand error. The thinking which really matters in conduct is not a\nthinking which imaginatively forecasts ideals which promise to fulfil\ndesire, or calculates means to their attainment\u2014that is sometimes\nuseful, sometimes harmful, and always subordinate, but thinking which\nreveals to the agent the situation in which he is to act, both, that\nis, the universal situation on which as man he always and everywhere\nstands, and the ever-varying and ever-novel situation in which he as\nthis individual, here and now, finds himself. In such knowledge of\ngiven or historic fact lie the natural determinants of his conduct, in\nsuch knowledge alone lies the condition of his freedom and his good.\nBut this does not mean that Moral Philosophy has not still much to\nlearn from Aristotle\u2019s _Ethics_. The work still remains one of the best\nintroductions to a study of its important subject-matter, it spreads\nbefore us a view of the relevant facts, it reduces them to manageable\ncompass and order, it raises some of the central problems, and makes\nacute and valuable suggestions towards their solution. Above all, it\nperpetually incites to renewed and independent reflection upon them.\nJ. A.

Again, since actions and arts\nand sciences are many, the Ends likewise come to be many: of the\nhealing art, for instance, health; of the ship-building art, a vessel;\nof the military art, victory; and of domestic management, wealth; are\nrespectively the Ends.\nAnd whatever of such actions, arts, or sciences range under some one\nfaculty (as under that of horsemanship the art of making bridles, and\nall that are connected with the manufacture of horse-furniture in\ngeneral; this itself again, and every action connected with war, under\nthe military art; and in the same way others under others), in all\nsuch, the Ends of the master-arts are more choice-worthy than those\nranging under them, because it is with a view to the former that the\nlatter are pursued.\n(And in this comparison it makes no difference whether the acts of\nworking are themselves the Ends of the actions, or something further\nbeside them, as is the case in the arts and sciences we have been just\nspeaking of.)\nSince then of all things which may be done there is some one End which\nwe desire for its own sake, and with a view to which we desire\neverything else; and since we do not choose in all instances with a\nfurther End in view (for then men would go on without limit, and so the\ndesire would be unsatisfied and fruitless), this plainly must be the\nChief Good, _i.e._ the best thing of all.\nSurely then, even with reference to actual life and conduct, the\nknowledge of it must have great weight; and like archers, with a mark\nin view, we shall be more likely to hit upon what is right: and if so,\nwe ought to try to describe, in outline at least, what it is and of\nwhich of the sciences and faculties it is the End.\nNow one would naturally suppose it to be the End of that which is most\ncommanding and most inclusive: and to this description, \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74[1]\nplainly answers: for this it is that determines which of the sciences\nshould be in the communities, and which kind individuals are to learn,\nand what degree of proficiency is to be required. Again; we see also\nranging under this the most highly esteemed faculties, such as the art\nmilitary, and that of domestic management, and Rhetoric. Well then,\nsince this uses all the other practical sciences, and moreover lays\ndown rules as to what men are to do, and from what to abstain, the End\nof this must include the Ends of the rest, and so must be The Good of\nMan. And grant that this is the same to the individual and to the\ncommunity, yet surely that of the latter is plainly greater and more\nperfect to discover and preserve: for to do this even for a single\nindividual were a matter for contentment; but to do it for a whole\nnation, and for communities generally, were more noble and godlike.\nSuch then are the objects proposed by our treatise, which is of the\nnature of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74: and I conceive I shall have spoken on them\nsatisfactorily, if they be made as distinctly clear as the nature of\nthe subject-matter will admit: for exactness must not be looked for in\nall discussions alike, any more than in all works of handicraft. Now\nthe notions of nobleness and justice, with the examination of which\n\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 is concerned, admit of variation and error to such a degree,\nthat they are supposed by some to exist conventionally only, and not in\nthe nature of things: but then, again, the things which are allowed to\nbe goods admit of a similar error, because harm comes to many from\nthem: for before now some have perished through wealth, and others\nthrough valour.\nWe must be content then, in speaking of such things and from such data,\nto set forth the truth roughly and in outline; in other words, since we\nare speaking of general matter and from general data, to draw also\nconclusions merely general. And in the same spirit should each person\nreceive what we say: for the man of education will seek exactness so\nfar in each subject as the nature of the thing admits, it being plainly\nmuch the same absurdity to put up with a mathematician who tries to\npersuade instead of proving, and to demand strict demonstrative\nreasoning of a Rhetorician.\nNow each man judges well what he knows, and of these things he is a\ngood judge: on each particular matter then he is a good judge who has\nbeen instructed in _it_, and in a general way the man of general mental\ncultivation.[2]\nHence the young man is not a fit student of Moral Philosophy, for he\nhas no experience in the actions of life, while all that is said\npresupposes and is concerned with these: and in the next place, since\nhe is apt to follow the impulses of his passions, he will hear as\nthough he heard not, and to no profit, the end in view being practice\nand not mere knowledge.\nAnd I draw no distinction between young in years, and youthful in\ntemper and disposition: the defect to which I allude being no direct\nresult of the time, but of living at the beck and call of passion, and\nfollowing each object as it rises.[3] For to them that are such the\nknowledge comes to be unprofitable, as to those of imperfect\nself-control: but, to those who form their desires and act in\naccordance with reason, to have knowledge on these points must be very\nprofitable.\nLet thus much suffice by way of preface on these three points, the\nstudent, the spirit in which our observations should be received, and\nthe object which we propose.\nChapter II.\nAnd now, resuming the statement with which we commenced, since all\nknowledge and moral choice grasps at good of some kind or another, what\ngood is that which we say \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 aims at? or, in other words, what is\nthe highest of all the goods which are the objects of action?\nSo far as name goes, there is a pretty general agreement: for HAPPINESS\nboth the multitude and the refined few call it, and \u201cliving well\u201d and\n\u201cdoing well\u201d they conceive to be the same with \u201cbeing happy;\u201d but about\nthe Nature of this Happiness, men dispute, and the multitude do not in\ntheir account of it agree with the wise. For some say it is some one of\nthose things which are palpable and apparent, as pleasure or wealth or\nhonour; in fact, some one thing, some another; nay, oftentimes the same\nman gives a different account of it; for when ill, he calls it health;\nwhen poor, wealth: and conscious of their own ignorance, men admire\nthose who talk grandly and above their comprehension. Some again held\nit to be something by itself, other than and beside these many good\nthings, which is in fact to all these the cause of their being good.\nNow to sift all the opinions would be perhaps rather a fruitless task;\nso it shall suffice to sift those which are most generally current, or\nare thought to have some reason in them.\nAnd here we must not forget the difference between reasoning from\nprinciples, and reasoning to principles: for with good cause did Plato\ntoo doubt about this, and enquire whether the right road is from\nprinciples or to principles, just as in the racecourse from the judges\nto the further end, or _vice vers\u00e2_.\nOf course, we must begin with what is known; but then this is of two\nkinds, what we _do_ know, and what we _may_ know:[5] perhaps then as\nindividuals we must begin with what we _do_ know. Hence the necessity\nthat he should have been well trained in habits, who is to study, with\nany tolerable chance of profit, the principles of nobleness and justice\nand moral philosophy generally. For a principle is a matter of fact,\nand if the fact is sufficiently clear to a man there will be no need in\naddition of the reason for the fact. And he that has been thus trained\neither has principles already, or can receive them easily: as for him\nwho neither has nor can receive them, let him hear his sentence from\nHesiod:\nHe is best of all who of himself conceiveth all things;\nGood again is he too who can adopt a good suggestion;\nBut whoso neither of himself conceiveth nor hearing from another\nLayeth it to heart;\u2014he is a useless man.\nChapter III.\nBut to return from this digression.\nNow of the Chief Good (_i.e._ of Happiness) men seem to form their\nnotions from the different modes of life, as we might naturally expect:\nthe many and most low conceive it to be pleasure, and hence they are\ncontent with the life of sensual enjoyment. For there are three lines\nof life which stand out prominently to view: that just mentioned, and\nthe life in society, and, thirdly, the life of contemplation.\nNow the many are plainly quite slavish, choosing a life like that of\nbrute animals: yet they obtain some consideration, because many of the\ngreat share the tastes of Sardanapalus. The refined and active again\nconceive it to be honour: for this may be said to be the end of the\nlife in society: yet it is plainly too superficial for the object of\nour search, because it is thought to rest with those who pay rather\nthan with him who receives it, whereas the Chief Good we feel\ninstinctively must be something which is our own, and not easily to be\ntaken from us.\nAnd besides, men seem to pursue honour, that they may believe\nthemselves to be good:[6] for instance, they seek to be honoured by the\nwise, and by those among whom they are known, and for virtue: clearly\nthen, in the opinion at least of these men, virtue is higher than\nhonour. In truth, one would be much more inclined to think this to be\nthe end of the life in society; yet this itself is plainly not\nsufficiently final: for it is conceived possible, that a man possessed\nof virtue might sleep or be inactive all through his life, or, as a\nthird case, suffer the greatest evils and misfortunes: and the man who\nshould live thus no one would call happy, except for mere disputation\u2019s\nsake.[7]\nAnd for these let thus much suffice, for they have been treated of at\nsufficient length in my Encyclia.[8]\nA third line of life is that of contemplation, concerning which we\nshall make our examination in the following pages.[9]\nAs for the life of money-making, it is one of constraint, and wealth\nmanifestly is not the good we are seeking, because it is for use, that\nis, for the sake of something further: and hence one would rather\nconceive the forementioned ends to be the right ones, for men rest\ncontent with them for their own sakes. Yet, clearly, they are not the\nobjects of our search either, though many words have been wasted on\nthem.[10] So much then for these.\nAgain, the notion of one Universal Good (the same, that is, in all\nthings), it is better perhaps we should examine, and discuss the\nmeaning of it, though such an enquiry is unpleasant, because they are\nfriends of ours who have introduced these \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7.[11] Still perhaps it\nmay appear better, nay to be our duty where the safety of the truth is\nconcerned, to upset if need be even our own theories, specially as we\nare lovers of wisdom: for since both are dear to us, we are bound to\nprefer the truth. Now they who invented this doctrine of \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7, did not\napply it to those things in which they spoke of priority and\nposteriority, and so they never made any \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 of numbers; but good is\npredicated in the categories of Substance, Quality, and Relation; now\nthat which exists of itself, i.e. Substance, is prior in the nature of\nthings to that which is relative, because this latter is an off-shoot,\nas it were, and result of that which is; on their own principle then\nthere cannot be a common \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 in the case of these.\nIn the next place, since good is predicated in as many ways as there\nare modes of existence [for it is predicated in the category of\nSubstance, as God, Intellect\u2014and in that of Quality, as The Virtues\u2014and\nin that of Quantity, as The Mean\u2014and in that of Relation, as The\nUseful\u2014and in that of Time, as Opportunity\u2014and in that of Place, as\nAbode; and other such like things], it manifestly cannot be something\ncommon and universal and one in all: else it would not have been\npredicated in all the categories, but in one only.\nThirdly, since those things which range under one \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 are also under\nthe cognisance of one science, there would have been, on their theory,\nonly one science taking cognisance of all goods collectively: but in\nfact there are many even for those which range under one category: for\ninstance, of Opportunity or Seasonableness (which I have before\nmentioned as being in the category of Time), the science is, in war,\ngeneralship; in disease, medical science; and of the Mean (which I\nquoted before as being in the category of Quantity), in food, the\nmedical science; and in labour or exercise, the gymnastic science. A\nperson might fairly doubt also what in the world they mean by very-this\nthat or the other, since, as they would themselves allow, the account\nof the humanity is one and the same in the very-Man, and in any\nindividual Man: for so far as the individual and the very-Man are both\nMan, they will not differ at all: and if so, then very-good and any\nparticular good will not differ, in so far as both are good. Nor will\nit do to say, that the eternity of the very-good makes it to be more\ngood; for what has lasted white ever so long, is no whiter than what\nlasts but for a day.\nNo. The Pythagoreans do seem to give a more credible account of the\nmatter, who place \u201cOne\u201d among the goods in their double list of goods\nand bads:[12] which philosophers, in fact, Speusippus[13] seems to have\nfollowed.\nBut of these matters let us speak at some other time. Now there is\nplainly a loophole to object to what has been advanced, on the plea\nthat the theory I have attacked is not by its advocates applied to all\ngood: but those goods only are spoken of as being under one \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1, which\nare pursued, and with which men rest content simply for their own\nsakes: whereas those things which have a tendency to produce or\npreserve them in any way, or to hinder their contraries, are called\ngood because of these other goods, and after another fashion. It is\nmanifest then that the goods may be so called in two senses, the one\nclass for their own sakes, the other because of these.\nVery well then, let us separate the independent goods from the\ninstrumental, and see whether they are spoken of as under one \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1.\nBut the question next arises, what kind of goods are we to call\nindependent? All such as are pursued even when separated from other\ngoods, as, for instance, being wise, seeing, and certain pleasures and\nhonours (for these, though we do pursue them with some further end in\nview, one would still place among the independent goods)? or does it\ncome in fact to this, that we can call nothing independent good except\nthe \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1, and so the concrete of it will be nought?\nIf, on the other hand, these are independent goods, then we shall\nrequire that the account of the goodness be the same clearly in all,\njust as that of the whiteness is in snow and white lead. But how stands\nthe fact? Why of honour and wisdom and pleasure the accounts are\ndistinct and different in so far as they are good. The Chief Good then\nis not something common, and after one \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1.\nBut then, how does the name come to be common (for it is not seemingly\na case of fortuitous equivocation)? Are different individual things\ncalled good by virtue of being from one source, or all conducing to one\nend, or rather by way of analogy, for that intellect is to the soul as\nsight to the body, and so on? However, perhaps we ought to leave these\nquestions now, for an accurate investigation of them is more properly\nthe business of a different philosophy. And likewise respecting the\n\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1: for even if there is some one good predicated in common of all\nthings that are good, or separable and capable of existing\nindependently, manifestly it cannot be the object of human action or\nattainable by Man; but we are in search now of something that is\nso.[14]\nIt may readily occur to any one, that it would be better to attain a\nknowledge of it with a view to such concrete goods as are attainable\nand practical, because, with this as a kind of model in our hands, we\nshall the better know what things are good for us individually, and\nwhen we know them, we shall attain them.\nSome plausibility, it is true, this argument possesses, but it is\ncontradicted by the facts of the Arts and Sciences; for all these,\nthough aiming at some good, and seeking that which is deficient, yet\npretermit the knowledge of it: now it is not exactly probable that all\nartisans without exception should be ignorant of so great a help as\nthis would be, and not even look after it; neither is it easy to see\nwherein a weaver or a carpenter will be profited in respect of his\ncraft by knowing the very-good, or how a man will be the more apt to\neffect cures or to command an army for having seen the \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 itself. For\nmanifestly it is not health after this general and abstract fashion\nwhich is the subject of the physician\u2019s investigation, but the health\nof Man, or rather perhaps of this or that man; for he has to heal\nindividuals.\u2014Thus much on these points.\nChapter IV.\nAnd now let us revert to the Good of which we are in search: what can\nit be? for manifestly it is different in different actions and arts:\nfor it is different in the healing art and in the art military, and\nsimilarly in the rest. What then is the Chief Good in each? Is it not\n\u201cthat for the sake of which the other things are done?\u201d and this in the\nhealing art is health, and in the art military victory, and in that of\nhouse-building a house, and in any other thing something else; in\nshort, in every action and moral choice the End, because in all cases\nmen do everything else with a view to this. So that if there is some\none End of all things which are and may be done, this must be the Good\nproposed by doing, or if more than one, then these.\nThus our discussion after some traversing about has come to the same\npoint which we reached before. And this we must try yet more to clear\nup.\nNow since the ends are plainly many, and of these we choose some with a\nview to others (wealth, for instance, musical instruments, and, in\ngeneral, all instruments), it is clear that all are not final: but the\nChief Good is manifestly something final; and so, if there is some one\nonly which is final, this must be the object of our search: but if\nseveral, then the most final of them will be it.\nNow that which is an object of pursuit in itself we call more final\nthan that which is so with a view to something else; that again which\nis never an object of choice with a view to something else than those\nwhich are so both in themselves and with a view to this ulterior\nobject: and so by the term \u201cabsolutely final,\u201d we denote that which is\nan object of choice always in itself, and never with a view to any\nother.\nAnd of this nature Happiness is mostly thought to be, for this we\nchoose always for its own sake, and never with a view to anything\nfurther: whereas honour, pleasure, intellect, in fact every excellence\nwe choose for their own sakes, it is true (because we would choose each\nof these even if no result were to follow), but we choose them also\nwith a view to happiness, conceiving that through their instrumentality\nwe shall be happy: but no man chooses happiness with a view to them,\nnor in fact with a view to any other thing whatsoever.\nThe same result[15] is seen to follow also from the notion of\nself-sufficiency, a quality thought to belong to the final good. Now by\nsufficient for Self, we mean not for a single individual living a\nsolitary life, but for his parents also and children and wife, and, in\ngeneral, friends and countrymen; for man is by nature adapted to a\nsocial existence. But of these, of course, some limit must be fixed:\nfor if one extends it to parents and descendants and friends\u2019 friends,\nthere is no end to it. This point, however, must be left for future\ninvestigation: for the present we define that to be self-sufficient\n\u201cwhich taken alone makes life choice-worthy, and to be in want of\nnothing;\u201d now of such kind we think Happiness to be: and further, to be\nmost choice-worthy of all things; not being reckoned with any other\nthing,[16] for if it were so reckoned, it is plain we must then allow\nit, with the addition of ever so small a good, to be more choice-worthy\nthan it was before:[17] because what is put to it becomes an addition of so\nmuch more good, and of goods the greater is ever the more\nchoice-worthy.\nSo then Happiness is manifestly something final and self-sufficient,\nbeing the end of all things which are and may be done.\nChapter V.\nBut, it may be, to call Happiness the Chief Good is a mere truism, and\nwhat is wanted is some clearer account of its real nature. Now this\nobject may be easily attained, when we have discovered what is the work\nof man; for as in the case of flute-player, statuary, or artisan of any\nkind, or, more generally, all who have any work or course of action,\ntheir Chief Good and Excellence is thought to reside in their work, so\nit would seem to be with man, if there is any work belonging to him.\nAre we then to suppose, that while carpenter and cobbler have certain\nworks and courses of action, Man as Man has none, but is left by Nature\nwithout a work? or would not one rather hold, that as eye, hand, and\nfoot, and generally each of his members, has manifestly some special\nwork; so too the whole Man, as distinct from all these, has some work\nof his own?[18]\nWhat then can this be? not mere life, because that plainly is shared\nwith him even by vegetables, and we want what is peculiar to him. We\nmust separate off then the life of mere nourishment and growth, and\nnext will come the life of sensation: but this again manifestly is\ncommon to horses, oxen, and every animal. There remains then a kind of\nlife of the Rational Nature apt to act: and of this Nature there are\ntwo parts denominated Rational, the one as being obedient to Reason,\nthe other as having and exerting it. Again, as this life is also spoken\nof in two ways,[19] we must take that which is in the way of actual\nworking, because this is thought to be most properly entitled to the\nname. If then the work of Man is a working of the soul in accordance\nwith reason, or at least not independently of reason, and we say that\nthe work of any given subject, and of that subject good of its kind,\nare the same in kind (as, for instance, of a harp-player and a good\nharp-player, and so on in every case, adding to the work eminence in\nthe way of excellence; I mean, the work of a harp-player is to play the\nharp, and of a good harp-player to play it well); if, I say, this is\nso, and we assume the work of Man to be life of a certain kind, that is\nto say a working of the soul, and actions with reason, and of a good\nman to do these things well and nobly, and in fact everything is\nfinished off well in the way of the excellence which peculiarly belongs\nto it: if all this is so, then the Good of Man comes to be \u201ca working\nof the Soul in the way of Excellence,\u201d or, if Excellence admits of\ndegrees, in the way of the best and most perfect Excellence.\nAnd we must add, \u1f10\u03bd \u03b2\u03af\u1ff3 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u1ff3;[20] for as it is not one swallow or one\nfine day that makes a spring, so it is not one day or a short time that\nmakes a man blessed and happy.\nLet this then be taken for a rough sketch of the Chief Good: since it\nis probably the right way to give first the outline, and fill it in\nafterwards. And it would seem that any man may improve and connect what\nis good in the sketch, and that time is a good discoverer and\nco-operator in such matters: it is thus in fact that all improvements\nin the various arts have been brought about, for any man may fill up a\ndeficiency.\nYou must remember also what has been already stated, and not seek for\nexactness in all matters alike, but in each according to the\nsubject-matter, and so far as properly belongs to the system. The\ncarpenter and geometrician, for instance, enquire into the right line\nin different fashion: the former so far as he wants it for his work,\nthe latter enquires into its nature and properties, because he is\nconcerned with the truth.\nSo then should one do in other matters, that the incidental matters may\nnot exceed the direct ones.\nAnd again, you must not demand the reason either in all things\nalike,[21] because in some it is sufficient that the fact has been well\ndemonstrated, which is the case with first principles; and the fact is\nthe first step, _i.e._ starting-point or principle.\nAnd of these first principles some are obtained by induction, some by\nperception,[22] some by a course of habituation, others in other\ndifferent ways. And we must try to trace up each in their own nature,\nand take pains to secure their being well defined, because they have\ngreat influence on what follows: it is thought, I mean, that the\nstarting-point or principle is more than half the whole matter, and\nthat many of the points of enquiry come simultaneously into view\nthereby.\nChapter VI.\nWe must now enquire concerning Happiness, not only from our conclusion\nand the data on which our reasoning proceeds, but likewise from what is\ncommonly said about it: because with what is true all things which\nreally are are in harmony, but with that which is false the true very\nsoon jars.\nNow there is a common division of goods into three classes; one being\ncalled external, the other two those of the soul and body respectively,\nand those belonging to the soul we call most properly and specially\ngood. Well, in our definition we assume that the actions and workings\nof the soul constitute Happiness, and these of course belong to the\nsoul. And so our account is a good one, at least according to this\nopinion, which is of ancient date, and accepted by those who profess\nphilosophy. Rightly too are certain actions and workings said to be the\nend, for thus it is brought into the number of the goods of the soul\ninstead of the external. Agreeing also with our definition is the\ncommon notion, that the happy man lives well and does well, for it has\nbeen stated by us to be pretty much a kind of living well and doing\nwell.\nAnd further, the points required in Happiness are found in combination\nin our account of it.\nFor some think it is virtue, others practical wisdom, others a kind of\nscientific philosophy; others that it is these, or else some one of\nthem, in combination with pleasure, or at least not independently of\nit; while others again take in external prosperity.\nOf these opinions, some rest on the authority of numbers or antiquity,\nothers on that of few, and those men of note: and it is not likely that\neither of these classes should be wrong in all points, but be right at\nleast in some one, or even in most.\nNow with those who assert it to be Virtue (Excellence), or some kind of\nVirtue, our account agrees: for working in the way of Excellence surely\nbelongs to Excellence.\nAnd there is perhaps no unimportant difference between conceiving of\nthe Chief Good as in possession or as in use, in other words, as a mere\nstate or as a working. For the state or habit[23] may possibly exist in\na subject without effecting any good, as, for instance, in him who is\nasleep, or in any other way inactive; but the working cannot so, for it\nwill of necessity act, and act well. And as at the Olympic games it is\nnot the finest and strongest men who are crowned, but they who enter\nthe lists, for out of these the prize-men are selected; so too in life,\nof the honourable and the good, it is they who act who rightly win the\nprizes.[24]\nTheir life too is in itself pleasant: for the feeling of pleasure is a\nmental sensation, and that is to each pleasant of which he is said to\nbe fond: a horse, for instance, to him who is fond of horses, and a\nsight to him who is fond of sights: and so in like manner just acts to\nhim who is fond of justice, and more generally the things in accordance\nwith virtue to him who is fond of virtue. Now in the case of the\nmultitude of men the things which they individually esteem pleasant\nclash, because they are not such by nature, whereas to the lovers of\nnobleness those things are pleasant which are such by nature: but the\nactions in accordance with virtue are of this kind, so that they are\npleasant both to the individuals and also in themselves.\nSo then their life has no need of pleasure as a kind of additional\nappendage, but involves pleasure in itself. For, besides what I have\njust mentioned, a man is not a good man at all who feels no pleasure in\nnoble actions,[25] just as no one would call that man just who does not\nfeel pleasure in acting justly, or liberal who does not in liberal\nactions, and similarly in the case of the other virtues which might be\nenumerated: and if this be so, then the actions in accordance with\nvirtue must be in themselves pleasurable. Then again they are certainly\ngood and noble, and each of these in the highest degree; if we are to\ntake as right the judgment of the good man, for he judges as we have\nsaid.\nThus then Happiness is most excellent, most noble, and most pleasant,\nand these attributes are not separated as in the well-known Delian\ninscription\u2014\n\u201cMost noble is that which is most just, but best is health;\nAnd naturally most pleasant is the obtaining one\u2019s desires.\u201d\nFor all these co-exist in the best acts of working: and we say that\nHappiness is these, or one, that is, the best of them.\nStill[26] it is quite plain that it does require the addition of\nexternal goods, as we have said: because without appliances it is\nimpossible, or at all events not easy, to do noble actions: for\nfriends, money, and political influence are in a manner instruments\nwhereby many things are done: some things there are again a deficiency\nin which mars blessedness; good birth, for instance, or fine offspring,\nor even personal beauty: for he is not at all capable of Happiness who\nis very ugly, or is ill-born, or solitary and childless; and still less\nperhaps supposing him to have very bad children or friends, or to have\nlost good ones by death. As we have said already, the addition of\nprosperity of this kind does seem necessary to complete the idea of\nHappiness; hence some rank good fortune, and others virtue, with\nHappiness.\nChapter VII.\nAnd hence too a question is raised, whether it is a thing that can be\nlearned, or acquired by habituation or discipline of some other kind,\nor whether it comes in the way of divine dispensation, or even in the\nway of chance.\nNow to be sure, if anything else is a gift of the Gods to men, it is\nprobable that Happiness is a gift of theirs too, and specially because\nof all human goods it is the highest. But this, it may be, is a\nquestion belonging more properly to an investigation different from\nours:[27] and it is quite clear, that on the supposition of its not\nbeing sent from the Gods direct, but coming to us by reason of virtue\nand learning of a certain kind, or discipline, it is yet one of the\nmost Godlike things; because the prize and End of virtue is manifestly\nsomewhat most excellent, nay divine and blessed.\nIt will also on this supposition be widely participated, for it may\nthrough learning and diligence of a certain kind exist in all who have\nnot been maimed[28] for virtue.\nAnd if it is better we should be happy thus than as a result of chance,\nthis is in itself an argument that the case is so; because those things\nwhich are in the way of nature, and in like manner of art, and of every\ncause, and specially the best cause, are by nature in the best way\npossible: to leave them to chance what is greatest and most noble would\nbe very much out of harmony with all these facts.[29]\nThe question may be determined also by a reference to our definition of\nHappiness, that it is a working of the soul in the way of excellence or\nvirtue of a certain kind: and of the other goods, some we must have to\nbegin with, and those which are co-operative and useful are given by\nnature as instruments.[30]\nThese considerations will harmonise also with what we said at the\ncommencement: for we assumed the End of \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 to be most excellent:\nnow this bestows most care on making the members of the community of a\ncertain character; good that is and apt to do what is honourable.\nWith good reason then neither ox nor horse nor any other brute animal\ndo we call happy, for none of them can partake in such working: and for\nthis same reason a child is not happy either, because by reason of his\ntender age he cannot yet perform such actions: if the term is applied,\nit is by way of anticipation.\nFor to constitute Happiness, there must be, as we have said, complete\nvirtue and a complete life: for many changes and chances of all kinds\narise during a life, and he who is most prosperous may become involved\nin great misfortunes in his old age, as in the heroic poems the tale is\ntold of Priam: but the man who has experienced such fortune and died in\nwretchedness, no man calls happy.\nChapter VIII.\nAre we then to call no man happy while he lives, and, as Solon would\nhave us, look to the end? And again, if we are to maintain this\nposition, is a man then happy when he is dead? or is not this a\ncomplete absurdity, specially in us who say Happiness is a working of a\ncertain kind?\nIf on the other hand we do not assert that the dead man is happy, and\nSolon does not mean this, but only that one would then be safe in\npronouncing a man happy, as being thenceforward out of the reach of\nevils and misfortunes, this too admits of some dispute, since it is\nthought that the dead has somewhat both of good and evil (if, as we\nmust allow, a man may have when alive but not aware of the\ncircumstances), as honour and dishonour, and good and bad fortune of\nchildren and descendants generally.\nNor is this view again without its difficulties: for, after a man has\nlived in blessedness to old age and died accordingly, many changes may\nbefall him in right of his descendants; some of them may be good and\nobtain positions in life accordant to their merits, others again quite\nthe contrary: it is plain too that the descendants may at different\nintervals or grades stand in all manner of relations to the\nancestors.[31] Absurd indeed would be the position that even the dead\nman is to change about with them and become at one time happy and at\nanother miserable. Absurd however it is on the other hand that the\naffairs of the descendants should in no degree and during no time\naffect the ancestors.\nBut we must revert to the point first raised,[32] since the present\nquestion will be easily determined from that.\nIf then we are to look to the end and then pronounce the man blessed,\nnot as being so but as having been so at some previous time, surely it\nis absurd that when he _is_ happy the truth is not to be asserted of\nhim, because we are unwilling to pronounce the living happy by reason\nof their liability to changes, and because, whereas we have conceived\nof happiness as something stable and no way easily changeable, the fact\nis that good and bad fortune are constantly circling about the same\npeople: for it is quite plain, that if we are to depend upon the\nfortunes of men, we shall often have to call the same man happy, and a\nlittle while after miserable, thus representing our happy man,\n\u201cChameleon-like, and based on rottenness.\u201d\nIs not this the solution? that to make our sentence dependent on the\nchanges of fortune, is no way right: for not in them stands the well,\nor the ill, but though human life needs these as accessories (which we\nhave allowed already), the workings in the way of virtue are what\ndetermine Happiness, and the contrary the contrary.\nAnd, by the way, the question which has been here discussed, testifies\nincidentally to the truth of our account of Happiness.[33] For to\nnothing does a stability of human results attach so much as it does to\nthe workings in the way of virtue, since these are held to be more\nabiding even than the sciences: and of these last again[34] the most\nprecious are the most abiding, because the blessed live in them most\nand most continuously, which seems to be the reason why they are not\nforgotten. So then this stability which is sought will be in the happy\nman, and he will be such through life, since always, or most of all, he\nwill be doing and contemplating the things which are in the way of\nvirtue: and the various chances of life he will bear most nobly, and at\nall times and in all ways harmoniously, since he is the truly good man,\nor in the terms of our proverb \u201ca faultless cube.\u201d\nAnd whereas the incidents of chance are many, and differ in greatness\nand smallness, the small pieces of good or ill fortune evidently do not\naffect the balance of life, but the great and numerous, if happening\nfor good, will make life more blessed (for it is their nature to\ncontribute to ornament, and the using of them comes to be noble and\nexcellent), but if for ill, they bruise as it were and maim the\nblessedness: for they bring in positive pain, and hinder many acts of\nworking. But still, even in these, nobleness shines through when a man\nbears contentedly many and great mischances not from insensibility to\npain but because he is noble and high-spirited.\nAnd if, as we have said, the acts of working are what determine the\ncharacter of the life, no one of the blessed can ever become wretched,\nbecause he will never do those things which are hateful and mean. For\nthe man who is truly good and sensible bears all fortunes, we presume,\nbecomingly, and always does what is noblest under the circumstances,\njust as a good general employs to the best advantage the force he has\nwith him; or a good shoemaker makes the handsomest shoe he can out of\nthe leather which has been given him; and all other good artisans\nlikewise. And if this be so, wretched never can the happy man come to\nbe: I do not mean to say he will be blessed should he fall into\nfortunes like those of Priam.\nNor, in truth, is he shifting and easily changeable, for on the one\nhand from his happiness he will not be shaken easily nor by ordinary\nmischances, but, if at all, by those which are great and numerous; and,\non the other, after such mischances he cannot regain his happiness in a\nlittle time; but, if at all, in a long and complete period, during\nwhich he has made himself master of great and noble things.\nWhy then should we not call happy the man who works in the way of\nperfect virtue, and is furnished with external goods sufficient for\nacting his part in the drama of life:[35] and this during no ordinary\nperiod but such as constitutes a complete life as we have been\ndescribing it.\nOr we must add, that not only is he to live so, but his death must be\nin keeping with such life, since the future is dark to us, and\nHappiness we assume to be in every way an end and complete. And, if\nthis be so, we shall call them among the living blessed who have and\nwill have the things specified, but blessed _as Men_.[36]\nOn these points then let it suffice to have denned thus much.\nChapter IX.\nNow that the fortunes of their descendants, and friends generally,\ncontribute nothing towards forming the condition of the dead, is\nplainly a very heartless notion, and contrary to the current opinions.\nBut since things which befall are many, and differ in all kinds of\nways, and some touch more nearly, others less, to go into minute\nparticular distinctions would evidently be a long and endless task: and\nso it may suffice to speak generally and in outline.\nIf then, as of the misfortunes which happen to one\u2019s self, some have a\ncertain weight and turn the balance of life, while others are, so to\nspeak, lighter; so it is likewise with those which befall all our\nfriends alike; if further, whether they whom each suffering befalls be\nalive or dead makes much more difference than in a tragedy the\npresupposing or actual perpetration of the various crimes and horrors,\nwe must take into our account this difference also, and still more\nperhaps the doubt concerning the dead whether they really partake of\nany good or evil; it seems to result from all these considerations,\nthat if anything does pierce the veil and reach them, be the same good\nor bad, it must be something trivial and small, either in itself or to\nthem; or at least of such a magnitude or such a kind as neither to make\nhappy them that are not so otherwise, nor to deprive of their\nblessedness them that are.[37]\nIt is plain then that the good or ill fortunes of their friends do\naffect the dead somewhat: but in such kind and degree as neither to\nmake the happy unhappy nor produce any other such effect.\nChapter X.\nHaving determined these points, let us examine with respect to\nHappiness, whether it belongs to the class of things praiseworthy or\nthings precious; for to that of faculties[38] it evidently does not.\nNow it is plain that everything which is a subject of praise is praised\nfor being of a certain kind and bearing a certain relation to something\nelse: for instance, the just, and the valiant, and generally the good\nman, and virtue itself, we praise because of the actions and the\nresults: and the strong man, and the quick runner, and so forth, we\npraise for being of a certain nature and bearing a certain relation to\nsomething good and excellent (and this is illustrated by attempts to\npraise the gods; for they are presented in a ludicrous aspect[39] by\nbeing referred to our standard, and this results from the fact, that\nall praise does, as we have said, imply reference to a standard). Now\nif it is to such objects that praise belongs, it is evident that what\nis applicable to the best objects is not praise, but something higher\nand better: which is plain matter of fact, for not only do we call the\ngods blessed and happy, but of men also we pronounce those blessed who\nmost nearly resemble the gods. And in like manner in respect of goods;\nno man thinks of praising Happiness as he does the principle of\njustice, but calls it blessed, as being somewhat more godlike and more\nexcellent.\nEudoxus[40] too is thought to have advanced a sound argument in support\nof the claim of pleasure to the highest prize: for the fact that,\nthough it is one of the good things, it is not praised, he took for an\nindication of its superiority to those which are subjects of praise: a\nsuperiority he attributed also to a god and the Chief Good, on the\nground that they form the standard to which everything besides is\nreferred. For praise applies to virtue, because it makes men apt to do\nwhat is noble; but encomia to definite works of body or mind.[41]\nHowever, it is perhaps more suitable to a regular treatise on encomia\nto pursue this topic with exactness: it is enough for our purpose that\nfrom what has been said it is evident that Happiness belongs to the\nclass of things precious and final. And it seems to be so also because\nof its being a starting-point; which it is, in that with a view to it\nwe all do everything else that is done; now the starting-point and\ncause of good things we assume to be something precious and divine.\nChapter XI.\nMoreover, since Happiness is a kind of working of the soul in the way\nof perfect Excellence, we must enquire concerning Excellence: for so\nprobably shall we have a clearer view concerning Happiness; and again,\nhe who is really a statesman is generally thought to have spent most\npains on this, for he wishes to make the citizens good and obedient to\nthe laws. (For examples of this class we have the lawgivers of the\nCretans and Laced\u00e6monians and whatever other such there have been.)\nBut if this investigation belongs properly to \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74, then clearly\nthe enquiry will be in accordance with our original design.\nWell, we are to enquire concerning Excellence, _i.e._ Human Excellence\nof course, because it was the Chief Good of Man and the Happiness of\nMan that we were enquiring of just now.\nAnd by Human Excellence we mean not that of man\u2019s body but that of his\nsoul; for we call Happiness a working of the Soul.\nAnd if this is so, it is plain that some knowledge of the nature of the\nSoul is necessary for the statesman, just as for the oculist a\nknowledge of the whole body, and the more so in proportion as \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\nis more precious and higher than the healing art: and in fact\nphysicians of the higher class do busy themselves much with the\nknowledge of the body.\nSo then the statesman is to consider the nature of the Soul: but he\nmust do so with these objects in view, and so far only as may suffice\nfor the objects of his special enquiry: for to carry his speculations\nto a greater exactness is perhaps a task more laborious than falls\nwithin his province.\nIn fact, the few statements made on the subject in my popular treatises\nare quite enough, and accordingly we will adopt them here: as, that the\nSoul consists of two parts, the Irrational and the Rational (as to\nwhether these are actually divided, as are the parts of the body, and\neverything that is capable of division; or are only metaphysically\nspeaking two, being by nature inseparable, as are convex and concave\ncircumferences, matters not in respect of our present purpose). And of\nthe Irrational, the one part seems common to other objects, and in fact\nvegetative; I mean the cause of nourishment and growth (for such a\nfaculty of the Soul one would assume to exist in all things that\nreceive nourishment, even in embryos, and this the same as in the\nperfect creatures; for this is more likely than that it should be a\ndifferent one).\nNow the Excellence of this manifestly is not peculiar to the human\nspecies but common to others: for this part and this faculty is thought\nto work most in time of sleep, and the good and bad man are least\ndistinguishable while asleep; whence it is a common saying that during\none half of life there is no difference between the happy and the\nwretched; and this accords with our anticipations, for sleep is an\ninactivity of the soul, in so far as it is denominated good or bad,\nexcept that in some wise some of its movements find their way through\nthe veil and so the good come to have better dreams than ordinary men.\nBut enough of this: we must forego any further mention of the nutritive\npart, since it is not naturally capable of the Excellence which is\npeculiarly human.\nAnd there seems to be another Irrational Nature of the Soul, which yet\nin a way partakes of Reason. For in the man who controls his appetites,\nand in him who resolves to do so and fails, we praise the Reason or\nRational part of the Soul, because it exhorts aright and to the best\ncourse: but clearly there is in them, beside the Reason, some other\nnatural principle which fights with and strains against the Reason.\n(For in plain terms, just as paralysed limbs of the body when their\nowners would move them to the right are borne aside in a contrary\ndirection to the left, so is it in the case of the Soul, for the\nimpulses of men who cannot control their appetites are to contrary\npoints: the difference is that in the case of the body we do see what\nis borne aside but in the case of the soul we do not. But, it may be,\nnot the less[42] on that account are we to suppose that there is in the\nSoul also somewhat besides the Reason, which is opposed to this and\ngoes against it; as to _how_ it is different, that is irrelevant.)\nBut of Reason this too does evidently partake, as we have said: for\ninstance, in the man of self-control it obeys Reason: and perhaps in\nthe man of perfected self-mastery,[43] or the brave man, it is yet\nmore obedient; in them it agrees entirely with the Reason.\nSo then the Irrational is plainly twofold: the one part, the merely\nvegetative, has no share of Reason, but that of desire, or appetition\ngenerally, does partake of it in a sense, in so far as it is obedient\nto it and capable of submitting to its rule. (So too in common phrase\nwe say we have \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 of our father or friends, and this in a different\nsense from that in which we say we have \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 of mathematics.)[44]\nNow that the Irrational is in some way persuaded by the Reason,\nadmonition, and every act of rebuke and exhortation indicate. If then\nwe are to say that this also has Reason, then the Rational, as well as\nthe Irrational, will be twofold, the one supremely and in itself, the\nother paying it a kind of filial regard.\nThe Excellence of Man then is divided in accordance with this\ndifference: we make two classes, calling the one Intellectual, and the\nother Moral; pure science, intelligence, and practical\nwisdom\u2014Intellectual: liberality, and perfected self-mastery\u2014Moral: in\nspeaking of a man\u2019s Moral character, we do not say he is a scientific\nor intelligent but a meek man, or one of perfected self-mastery: and we\npraise the man of science in right of his mental state;[45] and of\nthese such as are praiseworthy we call Excellences.\nBOOK II\nChapter I.\nWell: human Excellence is of two kinds, Intellectual and Moral:[1] now\nthe Intellectual springs originally, and is increased subsequently,\nfrom teaching (for the most part that is[2]), and needs therefore\nexperience and time; whereas the Moral comes from custom, and so the\nGreek term denoting it is but a slight deflection from the term\ndenoting custom in that language.\nFrom this fact it is plain that not one of the Moral Virtues comes to\nbe in us merely by nature: because of such things as exist by nature,\nnone can be changed by custom: a stone, for instance, by nature\ngravitating downwards, could never by custom be brought to ascend, not\neven if one were to try and accustom it by throwing it up ten thousand\ntimes; nor could file again be brought to descend, nor in fact could\nanything whose nature is in one way be brought by custom to be in\nanother. The Virtues then come to be in us neither by nature, nor in\ndespite of nature,[3] but we are furnished by nature with a capacity\nfor receiving themu and are perfected in them through custom.\nAgain, in whatever cases we get things by nature, we get the faculties\nfirst and perform the acts of working afterwards; an illustration of\nwhich is afforded by the case of our bodily senses, for it was not from\nhaving often seen or heard that we got these senses, but just the\nreverse: we had them and so exercised them, but did not have them\nbecause we had exercised them. But the Virtues we get by first\nperforming single acts of working, which, again, is the case of other\nthings, as the arts for instance; for what we have to make when we have\nlearned how, these we learn how to make by making: men come to be\nbuilders, for instance, by building; harp-players, by playing on the\nharp: exactly so, by doing just actions we come to be just; by doing\nthe actions of self-mastery we come to be perfected in self-mastery;\nand by doing brave actions brave.\nAnd to the truth of this testimony is borne by what takes place in\ncommunities: because the law-givers make the individual members good\nmen by habituation, and this is the intention certainly of every\nlaw-giver, and all who do not effect it well fail of their intent; and\nherein consists the difference between a good Constitution and a bad.\nAgain, every Virtue is either produced or destroyed from and by the\nvery same circumstances: art too in like manner; I mean it is by\nplaying the harp that both the good and the bad harp-players are\nformed: and similarly builders and all the rest; by building well men\nwill become good builders; by doing it badly bad ones: in fact, if this\nhad not been so, there would have been no need of instructors, but all\nmen would have been at once good or bad in their several arts without\nthem.\nSo too then is it with the Virtues: for by acting in the various\nrelations in which we are thrown with our fellow men, we come to be,\nsome just, some unjust: and by acting in dangerous positions and being\nhabituated to feel fear or confidence, we come to be, some brave,\nothers cowards.\nSimilarly is it also with respect to the occasions of lust and anger:\nfor some men come to be perfected in self-mastery and mild, others\ndestitute of all self-control and passionate; the one class by behaving\nin one way under them, the other by behaving in another. Or, in one\nword, the habits are produced from the acts of working like to them:\nand so what we have to do is to give a certain character to these\nparticular acts, because the habits formed correspond to the\ndifferences of these.\nSo then, whether we are accustomed this way or that straight from\nchildhood, makes not a small but an important difference, or rather I\nwould say it makes all the difference.\nChapter II.\nSince then the object of the present treatise is not mere speculation,\nas it is of some others (for we are enquiring not merely that we may\nknow what virtue is but that we may become virtuous, else it would have\nbeen useless), we must consider as to the particular actions how we are\nto do them, because, as we have just said, the quality of the habits\nthat shall be formed depends on these.\nNow, that we are to act in accordance with Right Reason is a general\nmaxim, and may for the present be taken for granted: we will speak of\nit hereafter, and say both what Right Reason is, and what are its\nrelations to the other virtues.[4]\nBut let this point be first thoroughly understood between us, that all\nwhich can be said on moral action must be said in outline, as it were,\nand not exactly: for as we remarked at the commencement, such reasoning\nonly must be required as the nature of the subject-matter admits of,\nand matters of moral action and expediency have no fixedness any more\nthan matters of health. And if the subject in its general maxims is\nsuch, still less in its application to particular cases is exactness\nattainable:[5] because these fall not under any art or system of rules,\nbut it must be left in each instance to the individual agents to look\nto the exigencies of the particular case, as it is in the art of\nhealing, or that of navigating a ship. Still, though the present\nsubject is confessedly such, we must try and do what we can for it.\nFirst then this must be noted, that it is the nature of such things to\nbe spoiled by defect and excess; as we see in the case of health and\nstrength (since for the illustration of things which cannot be seen we\nmust use those that can), for excessive training impairs the strength\nas well as deficient: meat and drink, in like manner, in too great or\ntoo small quantities, impair the health: while in due proportion they\ncause, increase, and preserve it.\nThus it is therefore with the habits of perfected Self-Mastery and\nCourage and the rest of the Virtues: for the man who flies from and\nfears all things, and never stands up against anything, comes to be a\ncoward; and he who fears nothing, but goes at everything, comes to be\nrash. In like manner too, he that tastes of every pleasure and abstains\nfrom none comes to lose all self-control; while he who avoids all, as\ndo the dull and clownish, comes as it were to lose his faculties of\nperception: that is to say, the habits of perfected Self-Mastery and\nCourage are spoiled by the excess and defect, but by the mean state are\npreserved.\nFurthermore, not only do the origination, growth, and marring of the\nhabits come from and by the same circumstances, but also the acts of\nworking after the habits are formed will be exercised on the same: for\nso it is also with those other things which are more directly matters\nof sight, strength for instance: for this comes by taking plenty of\nfood and doing plenty of work, and the man who has attained strength is\nbest able to do these: and so it is with the Virtues, for not only do\nwe by abstaining from pleasures come to be perfected in Self-Mastery,\nbut when we have come to be so we can best abstain from them: similarly\ntoo with Courage: for it is by accustoming ourselves to despise objects\nof fear and stand up against them that we come to be brave; and after\nwe have come to be so we shall be best able to stand up against such\nobjects.\nAnd for a test of the formation of the habits we must take the pleasure\nor pain which succeeds the acts; for he is perfected in Self-Mastery\nwho not only abstains from the bodily pleasures but is glad to do so;\nwhereas he who abstains but is sorry to do it has not Self-Mastery: he\nagain is brave who stands up against danger, either with positive\npleasure or at least without any pain; whereas he who does it with pain\nis not brave.[6]\nFor Moral Virtue has for its object-matter pleasures and pains, because\nby reason of pleasure we do what is bad, and by reason of pain decline\ndoing what is right (for which cause, as Plato observes, men should\nhave been trained straight from their childhood to receive pleasure and\npain from proper objects, for this is the right education). Again:\nsince Virtues have to do with actions and feelings, and on every\nfeeling and every action pleasure and pain follow, here again is\nanother proof that Virtue has for its object-matter pleasure and pain.\nThe same is shown also by the fact that punishments are effected\nthrough the instrumentality of these; because they are of the nature of\nremedies, and it is the nature of remedies to be the contraries of the\nills they cure. Again, to quote what we said before: every habit of the\nSoul by its very nature has relation to, and exerts itself upon, things\nof the same kind as those by which it is naturally deteriorated or\nimproved: now such habits do come to be vicious by reason of pleasures\nand pains, that is, by men pursuing or avoiding respectively, either\nsuch as they ought not, or at wrong times, or in wrong manner, and so\nforth (for which reason, by the way, some people define the Virtues as\ncertain states of impassibility and utter quietude,[7] but they are\nwrong because they speak without modification, instead of adding \u201cas\nthey ought,\u201d \u201cas they ought not,\u201d and \u201cwhen,\u201d and so on). Virtue then\nis assumed to be that habit which is such, in relation to pleasures and\npains, as to effect the best results, and Vice the contrary.\nThe following considerations may also serve to set this in a clear\nlight. There are principally three things moving us to choice and three\nto avoidance, the honourable, the expedient, the pleasant; and their\nthree contraries, the dishonourable, the hurtful, and the painful: now\nthe good man is apt to go right, and the bad man wrong, with respect to\nall these of course, but most specially with respect to pleasure:\nbecause not only is this common to him with all animals but also it is\na concomitant of all those things which move to choice, since both the\nhonourable and the expedient give an impression of pleasure.\nAgain, it grows up with us all from infancy, and so it is a hard matter\nto remove from ourselves this feeling, engrained as it is into our very\nlife.\nAgain, we adopt pleasure and pain (some of us more, and some less) as\nthe measure even of actions: for this cause then our whole business\nmust be with them, since to receive right or wrong impressions of\npleasure and pain is a thing of no little importance in respect of the\nactions. Once more; it is harder, as Heraclitus says, to fight against\npleasure than against anger: now it is about that which is more than\ncommonly difficult that art comes into being, and virtue too, because\nin that which is difficult the good is of a higher order: and so for\nthis reason too both virtue and moral philosophy generally must wholly\nbusy themselves respecting pleasures and pains, because he that uses\nthese well will be good, he that does so ill will be bad.\nLet us then be understood to have stated, that Virtue has for its\nobject-matter pleasures and pains, and that it is either increased or\nmarred by the same circumstances (differently used) by which it is\noriginally generated, and that it exerts itself on the same\ncircumstances out of which it was generated.\nChapter III.\nNow I can conceive a person perplexed as to the meaning of our\nstatement, that men must do just actions to become just, and those of\nself-mastery to acquire the habit of self-mastery; \u201cfor,\u201d he would say,\n\u201cif men are doing the actions they have the respective virtues already,\njust as men are grammarians or musicians when they do the actions of\neither art.\u201d May we not reply by saying that it is not so even in the\ncase of the arts referred to: because a man may produce something\ngrammatical either by chance or the suggestion of another; but then\nonly will he be a grammarian when he not only produces something\ngrammatical but does so grammarian-wise, _i.e._ in virtue of the\ngrammatical knowledge he himself possesses.\nAgain, the cases of the arts and the virtues are not parallel: because\nthose things which are produced by the arts have their excellence in\nthemselves, and it is sufficient therefore that these when produced\nshould be in a certain state: but those which are produced in the way\nof the virtues, are, strictly speaking, actions of a certain kind (say\nof Justice or perfected Self-Mastery), not merely if in themselves they\nare in a certain state but if also he who does them does them being\nhimself in a certain state, first if knowing what he is doing, next if\nwith deliberate preference, and with such preference for the things\u2019\nown sake; and thirdly if being himself stable and unapt to change. Now\nto constitute possession of the arts these requisites are not reckoned\nin, excepting the one point of knowledge: whereas for possession of the\nvirtues knowledge avails little or nothing, but the other requisites\navail not a little, but, in fact, are all in all, and these requisites\nas a matter of fact do come from oftentimes doing the actions of\nJustice and perfected Self-Mastery.\nThe facts,[8] it is true, are called by the names of these habits when\nthey are such as the just or perfectly self-mastering man would do; but\nhe is not in possession of the virtues who merely does these facts, but\nhe who also so does them as the just and self-mastering do them.\nWe are right then in saying, that these virtues are formed in a man by\nhis doing the actions; but no one, if he should leave them undone,\nwould be even in the way to become a good man. Yet people in general do\nnot perform these actions, but taking refuge in talk they flatter\nthemselves they are philosophising, and that they will so be good men:\nacting in truth very like those sick people who listen to the doctor\nwith great attention but do nothing that he tells them: just as these\nthen cannot be well bodily under such a course of treatment, so neither\ncan those be mentally by such philosophising.\nChapter IV.\nNext, we must examine what Virtue is.[9] Well, since the things which\ncome to be in the mind are, in all, of three kinds, Feelings,\nCapacities, States, Virtue of course must belong to one of the three\nclasses.\nBy Feelings, I mean such as lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy,\nfriendship, hatred, longing, emulation, compassion, in short all such\nas are followed by pleasure or pain: by Capacities, those in right of\nwhich we are said to be capable of these feelings; as by virtue of\nwhich we are able to have been made angry, or grieved, or to have\ncompassionated; by States, those in right of which we are in a certain\nrelation good or bad to the aforementioned feelings; to having been\nmade angry, for instance, we are in a wrong relation if in our anger we\nwere too violent or too slack, but if we were in the happy medium we\nare in a right relation to the feeling. And so on of the rest.\nNow Feelings neither the virtues nor vices are, because in right of the\nFeelings we are not denominated either good or bad, but in right of the\nvirtues and vices we are.\nAgain, in right of the Feelings we are neither praised nor blamed,[10]\n(for a man is not commended for being afraid or being angry, nor blamed\nfor being angry merely but for being so in a particular way), but in\nright of the virtues and vices we are.\nAgain, both anger and fear we feel without moral choice, whereas the\nvirtues are acts of moral choice, or at least certainly not independent\nof it.\nMoreover, in right of the Feelings we are said to be moved, but in\nright of the virtues and vices not to be moved, but disposed, in a\ncertain way.\nAnd for these same reasons they are not Capacities, for we are not\ncalled good or bad merely because we are able to feel, nor are we\npraised or blamed.\nAnd again, Capacities we have by nature, but we do not come to be good\nor bad by nature, as we have said before.\nSince then the virtues are neither Feelings nor Capacities, it remains\nthat they must be States.\nChapter V.\nNow what the genus of Virtue is has been said; but we must not merely\nspeak of it thus, that it is a state but say also what kind of a state\nit is.\nWe must observe then that all excellence makes that whereof it is the\nexcellence both to be itself in a good state and to perform its work\nwell. The excellence of the eye, for instance, makes both the eye good\nand its work also: for by the excellence of the eye we see well. So too\nthe excellence of the horse makes a horse good, and good in speed, and\nin carrying his rider, and standing up against the enemy. If then this\nis universally the case, the excellence of Man, i.e. Virtue, must be a\nstate whereby Man comes to be good and whereby he will perform well his\nproper work. Now how this shall be it is true we have said already, but\nstill perhaps it may throw light on the subject to see what is its\ncharacteristic nature.\nIn all quantity then, whether continuous or discrete,[11] one may take\nthe greater part, the less, or the exactly equal, and these either with\nreference to the thing itself, or relatively to us: and the exactly\nequal is a mean between excess and defect. Now by the mean of the\nthing, _i.e._ absolute mean, I denote that which is equidistant from\neither extreme (which of course is one and the same to all), and by the\nmean relatively to ourselves, that which is neither too much nor too\nlittle for the particular individual. This of course is not one nor the\nsame to all: for instance, suppose ten is too much and two too little,\npeople take six for the absolute mean; because it exceeds the smaller\nsum by exactly as much as it is itself exceeded by the larger, and this\nmean is according to arithmetical proportion.[12]\nBut the mean relatively to ourselves must not be so found ; for it does\nnot follow, supposing ten min\u00e6[13] is too large a quantity to eat and\ntwo too small, that the trainer will order his man six; because for the\nperson who is to take it this also may be too much or too little: for\nMilo it would be too little, but for a man just commencing his athletic\nexercises too much: similarly too of the exercises themselves, as\nrunning or wrestling.\nSo then it seems every one possessed of skill avoids excess and defect,\nbut seeks for and chooses the mean, not the absolute but the relative.\nNow if all skill thus accomplishes well its work by keeping an eye on\nthe mean, and bringing the works to this point (whence it is common\nenough to say of such works as are in a good state, \u201cone cannot add to\nor take ought from them,\u201d under the notion of excess or defect\ndestroying goodness but the mean state preserving it), and good\nartisans, as we say, work with their eye on this, and excellence, like\nnature, is more exact and better than any art in the world, it must\nhave an aptitude to aim at the mean.\nIt is moral excellence, _i.e._ Virtue, of course which I mean, because\nthis it is which is concerned with feelings and actions, and in these\nthere can be excess and defect and the mean: it is possible, for\ninstance, to feel the emotions of fear, confidence, lust, anger,\ncompassion, and pleasure and pain generally, too much or too little,\nand in either case wrongly; but to feel them when we ought, on what\noccasions, towards whom, why, and as, we should do, is the mean, or in\nother words the best state, and this is the property of Virtue.\nIn like manner too with respect to the actions, there may be excess and\ndefect and the mean. Now Virtue is concerned with feelings and actions,\nin which the excess is wrong and the defect is blamed but the mean is\npraised and goes right; and both these circumstances belong to Virtue.\nVirtue then is in a sense a mean state, since it certainly has an\naptitude for aiming at the mean.\nAgain, one may go wrong in many different ways (because, as the\nPythagoreans expressed it, evil is of the class of the infinite, good\nof the finite), but right only in one; and so the former is easy, the\nlatter difficult; easy to miss the mark, but hard to hit it: and for\nthese reasons, therefore, both the excess and defect belong to Vice,\nand the mean state to Virtue; for, as the poet has it,\n\u201cMen may be bad in many ways,\nBut good in one alone.\u201d\nChapter VI.\nVirtue then is \u201ca state apt to exercise deliberate choice, being in the\nrelative mean, determined by reason, and[14] as the man of practical\nwisdom would determine.\u201d\nIt is a middle state between too faulty ones, in the way of excess on\none side and of defect on the other: and it is so moreover, because the\nfaulty states on one side fall short of, and those on the other exceed,\nwhat is right, both in the case of the feelings and the actions; but\nVirtue finds, and when found adopts, the mean.\nAnd so, viewing it in respect of its essence and definition, Virtue is\na mean state; but in reference to the chief good and to excellence it\nis the highest state possible.\nBut it must not be supposed that every action or every feeling is\ncapable of subsisting in this mean state, because some there are which\nare so named as immediately to convey the notion of badness, as\nmalevolence, shamelessness, envy; or, to instance in actions, adultery,\ntheft, homicide; for all these and suchlike are blamed because they are\nin themselves bad, not the having too much or too little of them.\nIn these then you never can go right, but must always be wrong: nor in\nsuch does the right or wrong depend on the selection of a proper\nperson, time, or manner (take adultery for instance), but simply doing\nany one soever of those things is being wrong.\nYou might as well require that there should be determined a mean state,\nan excess and a defect in respect of acting unjustly, being cowardly,\nor giving up all control of the passions: for at this rate there will\nbe of excess and defect a mean state; of excess, excess; and of defect,\ndefect.\nBut just as of perfected self-mastery and courage there is no excess\nand defect, because the mean is in one point of view the highest\npossible state, so neither of those faulty states can you have a mean\nstate, excess, or defect, but howsoever done they are wrong: you\ncannot, in short, have of excess and defect a mean state, nor of a mean\nstate excess and defect.\nChapter VII.\nIt is not enough, however, to state this in general terms, we must also\napply it to particular instances, because in treatises on moral conduct\ngeneral statements have an air of vagueness, but those which go into\ndetail one of greater reality: for the actions after all must be in\ndetail, and the general statements, to be worth anything, must hold\ngood here.\nWe must take these details then from the well-known scheme.[15]\nI. In respect of fears and confidence or boldness:\nThe Mean state is Courage: men may exceed, of course, either in absence\nof fear or in positive confidence: the former has no name (which is a\ncommon case), the latter is called rash: again, the man who has too\nmuch fear and too little confidence is called a coward.\nII. In respect of pleasures and pains (but not all, and perhaps fewer\npains than pleasures):\nThe Mean state here is perfected Self-Mastery, the defect total absence\nof Self-control. As for defect in respect of pleasure, there are really\nno people who are chargeable with it, so, of course, there is really no\nname for such characters, but, as they are conceivable, we will give\nthem one and call them insensible.\nIII. In respect of giving and taking wealth[16] (_a_):\nThe mean state is Liberality, the excess Prodigality, the defect\nStinginess: here each of the extremes involves really an excess and\ndefect contrary to each other: I mean, the prodigal gives out too much\nand takes in too little, while the stingy man takes in too much and\ngives out too little. (It must be understood that we are now giving\nmerely an outline and summary, intentionally: and we will, in a later\npart of the treatise, draw out the distinctions with greater\nexactness.)\nIV. In respect of wealth (b):\nThere are other dispositions besides these just mentioned; a mean state\ncalled Munificence (for the munificent man differs from the liberal,\nthe former having necessarily to do with great wealth, the latter with\nbut small); the excess called by the names either of Want of taste or\nVulgar Profusion, and the defect Paltriness (these also differ from the\nextremes connected with liberality, and the manner of their difference\nshall also be spoken of later).\nV. In respect of honour and dishonour (a):\nThe mean state Greatness of Soul, the excess which may be called\n\u03c7\u03b1\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2,[17] and the defect Littleness of Soul.\nVI. In respect of honour and dishonour (b):\nNow there is a state bearing the same relation to Greatness of Soul as\nwe said just now Liberality does to Munificence, with the difference\nthat is of being about a small amount of the same thing: this state\nhaving reference to small honour, as Greatness of Soul to great honour;\na man may, of course, grasp at honour either more than he should or\nless; now he that exceeds in his grasping at it is called ambitious, he\nthat falls short unambitious, he that is just as he should be has no\nproper name: nor in fact have the states, except that the disposition\nof the ambitious man is called ambition. For this reason those who are\nin either extreme lay claim to the mean as a debateable land, and we\ncall the virtuous character sometimes by the name ambitious,[18]\nsometimes by that of unambitious, and we commend sometimes the one and\nsometimes the other. Why we do it shall be said in the subsequent part\nof the treatise; but now we will go on with the rest of the virtues\nafter the plan we have laid down.\nVII. In respect of anger:\nHere too there is excess, defect, and a mean state; but since they may\nbe said to have really no proper names, as we call the virtuous\ncharacter Meek, we will call the mean state Meekness, and of the\nextremes, let the man who is excessive be denominated Passionate, and\nthe faulty state Passionateness, and him who is deficient Angerless,\nand the defect Angerlessness.\nThere are also three other mean states, having some mutual resemblance,\nbut still with differences; they are alike in that they all have for\ntheir object-matter intercourse of words and deeds, and they differ in\nthat one has respect to truth herein, the other two to what is\npleasant; and this in two ways, the one in relaxation and amusement,\nthe other in all things which occur in daily life. We must say a word\nor two about these also, that we may the better see that in all matters\nthe mean is praiseworthy, while the extremes are neither right nor\nworthy of praise but of blame.\nNow of these, it is true, the majority have really no proper names, but\nstill we must try, as in the other cases, to coin some for them for the\nsake of clearness and intelligibleness.\nI. In respect of truth:\nThe man who is in the mean state we will call Truthful, and his state\nTruthfulness, and as to the disguise of truth, if it be on the side of\nexaggeration, Braggadocia, and him that has it a Braggadocio; if on\nthat of diminution, Reserve and Reserved shall be the terms.\nII. In respect of what is pleasant in the way of relaxation or\namusement.\nThe mean state shall be called Easy-pleasantry, and the character\naccordingly a man of Easy-pleasantry; the excess Buffoonery, and the\nman a Buffoon; the man deficient herein a Clown, and his state\nClownishness.\nIII. In respect of what is pleasant in daily life.\nHe that is as he should be may be called Friendly, and his mean state\nFriendliness: he that exceeds, if it be without any interested motive,\nsomewhat too Complaisant, if with such motive, a Flatterer: he that is\ndeficient and in all instances unpleasant, Quarrelsome and Cross.\nThere are mean states likewise in feelings and matters concerning them.\nShamefacedness, for instance, is no virtue, still a man is praised for\nbeing shamefaced: for in these too the one is denominated the man in\nthe mean state, the other in the excess; the Dumbfoundered, for\ninstance, who is overwhelmed with shame on all and any occasions: the\nman who is in the defect, _i.e._ who has no shame at all in his\ncomposition, is called Shameless: but the right character Shamefaced.\nIndignation against successful vice,[19] again, is a state in the mean\nbetween Envy and Malevolence: they all three have respect to pleasure\nand pain produced by what happens to one\u2019s neighbour: for the man who\nhas this right feeling is annoyed at undeserved success of others,\nwhile the envious man goes beyond him and is annoyed at all success of\nothers, and the malevolent falls so far short of feeling annoyance that\nhe even rejoices [at misfortune of others].\nBut for the discussion of these also there will be another opportunity,\nas of Justice too, because the term is used in more senses than one. So\nafter this we will go accurately into each and say how they are mean\nstates: and in like manner also with respect to the Intellectual\nExcellences.\nChapter VIII.\nNow as there are three states in each case, two faulty either in the\nway of excess or defect, and one right, which is the mean state, of\ncourse all are in a way opposed to one another; the extremes, for\ninstance, not only to the mean but also to one another, and the mean to\nthe extremes: for just as the half is greater if compared with the less\nportion, and less if compared with the greater, so the mean states,\ncompared with the defects, exceed, whether in feelings or actions, and\n_vice versa_. The brave man, for instance, shows as rash when compared\nwith the coward, and cowardly when compared with the rash; similarly\ntoo the man of perfected self-mastery, viewed in comparison with the\nman destitute of all perception, shows like a man of no self-control,\nbut in comparison with the man who really has no self-control, he looks\nlike one destitute of all perception: and the liberal man compared with\nthe stingy seems prodigal, and by the side of the prodigal, stingy.\nAnd so the extreme characters push away, so to speak, towards each\nother the man in the mean state; the brave man is called a rash man by\nthe coward, and a coward by the rash man, and in the other cases\naccordingly. And there being this mutual opposition, the contrariety\nbetween the extremes is greater than between either and the mean,\nbecause they are further from one another than from the mean, just as\nthe greater or less portion differ more from each other than either\nfrom the exact half.\nAgain, in some cases an extreme will bear a resemblance to the mean;\nrashness, for instance, to courage, and prodigality to liberality; but\nbetween the extremes there is the greatest dissimilarity. Now things\nwhich are furthest from one another[20] are defined to be contrary, and\nso the further off the more contrary will they be.\nFurther: of the extremes in some cases the excess, and in others the\ndefect, is most opposed to the mean: to courage, for instance, not\nrashness which is the excess, but cowardice which is the defect;\nwhereas to perfected self-mastery not insensibility which is the defect\nbut absence of all self-control which is the excess.\nAnd for this there are two reasons to be given; one from the nature of\nthe thing itself, because from the one extreme being nearer and more\nlike the mean, we do not put this against it, but the other; as, for\ninstance, since rashness is thought to be nearer to courage than\ncowardice is, and to resemble it more, we put cowardice against courage\nrather than rashness, because those things which are further from the\nmean are thought to be more contrary to it. This then is one reason\narising from the thing itself; there is another arising from our own\nconstitution and make: for in each man\u2019s own case those things give the\nimpression of being more contrary to the mean to which we individually\nhave a natural bias. Thus we have a natural bias towards pleasures, for\nwhich reason we are much more inclined to the rejection of all\nself-control, than to self-discipline.\nThese things then to which the bias is, we call more contrary, and so\ntotal want of self-control (the excess) is more contrary than the\ndefect is to perfected self-mastery.\nChapter IX.\nNow that Moral Virtue is a mean state, and how it is so, and that it\nlies between two faulty states, one in the way of excess and another in\nthe way of defect, and that it is so because it has an aptitude to aim\nat the mean both in feelings and actions, all this has been set forth\nfully and sufficiently.\nAnd so it is hard to be good: for surely hard it is in each instance to\nfind the mean, just as to find the mean point or centre of a circle is\nnot what any man can do, but only he who knows how: just so to be\nangry, to give money, and be expensive, is what any man can do, and\neasy: but to do these to the right person, in due proportion, at the\nright time, with a right object, and in the right manner, this is not\nas before what any man can do, nor is it easy; and for this cause\ngoodness is rare, and praiseworthy, and noble.\nTherefore he who aims at the mean should make it his first care to keep\naway from that extreme which is more contrary than the other to the\nmean; just as Calypso in Homer advises Ulysses,\n\u201cClear of this smoke and surge thy barque direct;\u201d\nbecause of the two extremes the one is always more, and the other less,\nerroneous; and, therefore, since to hit exactly on the mean is\ndifficult, one must take the least of the evils as the safest plan;[21]\nand this a man will be doing, if he follows this method.\nWe ought also to take into consideration our own natural bias; which\nvaries in each man\u2019s case, and will be ascertained from the pleasure\nand pain arising in us. Furthermore, we should force ourselves off in\nthe contrary direction, because we shall find ourselves in the mean\nafter we have removed ourselves far from the wrong side, exactly as men\ndo in straightening bent timber.[22]\nBut in all cases we must guard most carefully against what is pleasant,\nand pleasure itself, because we are not impartial judges of it.\nWe ought to feel in fact towards pleasure as did the old counsellors\ntowards Helen, and in all cases pronounce a similar sentence; for so by\nsending it away from us, we shall err the less.[23]\nWell, to speak very briefly, these are the precautions by adopting\nwhich we shall be best able to attain the mean.\nStill, perhaps, after all it is a matter of difficulty, and specially\nin the particular instances: it is not easy, for instance, to determine\nexactly in what manner, with what persons, for what causes, and for\nwhat length of time, one ought to feel anger: for we ourselves\nsometimes praise those who are defective in this feeling, and we call\nthem meek; at another, we term the hot-tempered manly and spirited.\nThen, again, he who makes a small deflection from what is right, be it\non the side of too much or too little, is not blamed, only he who makes\na considerable one; for he cannot escape observation. But to what point\nor degree a man must err in order to incur blame, it is not easy to\ndetermine exactly in words: nor in fact any of those points which are\nmatter of perception by the Moral Sense: such questions are matters of\ndetail, and the decision of them rests with the Moral Sense.[24]\nAt all events thus much is plain, that the mean state is in all things\npraiseworthy, and that practically we must deflect sometimes towards\nexcess sometimes towards defect, because this will be the easiest\nmethod of hitting on the mean, that is, on what is right.\nBOOK III\nChapter I.\nNow since Virtue is concerned with the regulation of feelings and\nactions, and praise and blame arise upon such as are voluntary, while\nfor the involuntary allowance is made, and sometimes compassion is\nexcited, it is perhaps a necessary task for those who are investigating\nthe nature of Virtue to draw out the distinction between what is\nvoluntary and what involuntary; and it is certainly useful for\nlegislators, with respect to the assigning of honours and punishments.\nInvoluntary actions then are thought to be of two kinds, being done\neither on compulsion, or by reason of ignorance. An action is, properly\nspeaking, compulsory, when the origination is external to the agent,\nbeing such that in it the agent (perhaps we may more properly say the\npatient) contributes nothing; as if a wind were to convey you anywhere,\nor men having power over your person.\nBut when actions are done, either from fear of greater evils, or from\nsome honourable motive, as, for instance, if you were ordered to commit\nsome base act by a despot who had your parents or children in his\npower, and they were to be saved upon your compliance or die upon your\nrefusal, in such cases there is room for a question whether the actions\nare voluntary or involuntary.\nA similar question arises with respect to cases of throwing goods\noverboard in a storm: abstractedly no man throws away his property\nwillingly, but with a view to his own and his shipmates\u2019 safety any one\nwould who had any sense.\nThe truth is, such actions are of a mixed kind, but are most like\nvoluntary actions; for they are choice-worthy at the time when they are\nbeing done, and the end or object of the action must be taken with\nreference to the actual occasion. Further, we must denominate an action\nvoluntary or involuntary at the time of doing it: now in the given case\nthe man acts voluntarily, because the originating of the motion of his\nlimbs in such actions rests with himself; and where the origination is\nin himself it rests with himself to do or not to do.\nSuch actions then are voluntary, though in the abstract perhaps\ninvoluntary because no one would choose any of such things in and by\nitself.\nBut for such actions men sometimes are even praised, as when they\nendure any disgrace or pain to secure great and honourable equivalents;\nif _vice vers\u00e2_, then they are blamed, because it shows a base mind to\nendure things very disgraceful for no honourable object, or for a\ntrifling one.\nFor some again no praise is given, but allowance is made; as where a\nman does what he should not by reason of such things as overstrain the\npowers of human nature, or pass the limits of human endurance.\nSome acts perhaps there are for which compulsion cannot be pleaded, but\na man should rather suffer the worst and die; how absurd, for instance,\nare the pleas of compulsion with which Alcmaeon in Euripides\u2019 play\nexcuses his matricide!\nBut it is difficult sometimes to decide what kind of thing should be\nchosen instead of what, or what endured in preference to what, and much\nmoreso to abide by one\u2019s decisions: for in general the alternatives are\npainful, and the actions required are base, and so praise or blame is\nawarded according as persons have been compelled or no.\nWhat kind of actions then are to be called compulsory? may we say,\nsimply and abstractedly whenever the cause is external and the agent\ncontributes nothing; and that where the acts are in themselves such as\none would not wish but choice-worthy at the present time and in\npreference to such and such things, and where the origination rests\nwith the agent, the actions are in themselves involuntary but at the\ngiven time and in preference to such and such things voluntary; and\nthey are more like voluntary than involuntary, because the actions\nconsist of little details, and these are voluntary.\nBut what kind of things one ought to choose instead of what, it is not\neasy to settle, for there are many differences in particular instances.\nBut suppose a person should say, things pleasant and honourable exert a\ncompulsive force (for that they are external and do compel); at that\nrate every action is on compulsion, because these are universal motives\nof action.\nAgain, they who act on compulsion and against their will do so with\npain; but they who act by reason of what is pleasant or honourable act\nwith pleasure.\nIt is truly absurd for a man to attribute his actions to external\nthings instead of to his own capacity for being easily caught by\nthem;[1] or, again, to ascribe the honourable to himself, and the base\nones to pleasure.\nSo then that seems to be compulsory \u201cwhose origination is from without,\nthe party compelled contributing nothing.\u201d\nChapter II.\nNow every action of which ignorance is the cause is not-voluntary, but\nthat only is involuntary which is attended with pain and remorse; for\nclearly the man who has done anything by reason of ignorance, but is\nnot annoyed at his own action, cannot be said to have done it _with_\nhis will because he did not know he was doing it, nor again _against_\nhis will because he is not sorry for it.\nSo then of the class \u201cacting by reason of ignorance,\u201d he who feels\nregret afterwards is thought to be an involuntary agent, and him that\nhas no such feeling, since he certainly is different from the other, we\nwill call a not-voluntary agent; for as there is a real difference it\nis better to have a proper name.\nAgain, there seems to be a difference between acting _because of_\nignorance and acting _with_ ignorance: for instance, we do not usually\nassign ignorance as the cause of the actions of the drunken or angry\nman, but either the drunkenness or the anger, yet they act not\nknowingly but with ignorance.\nAgain, every bad man is ignorant what he ought to do and what to leave\nundone, and by reason of such error men become unjust and wholly evil.\nAgain, we do not usually apply the term involuntary when a man is\nignorant of his own true interest;[2] because ignorance which affects\nmoral choice[3] constitutes depravity but not involuntariness: nor does\nany ignorance of principle (because for this men are blamed) but\nignorance in particular details, wherein consists the action and\nwherewith it is concerned, for in these there is both compassion and\nallowance, because he who acts in ignorance of any of them acts in a\nproper sense involuntarily.\nIt may be as well, therefore, to define these particular details; what\nthey are, and how many; viz. who acts, what he is doing, with respect\nto what or in what, sometimes with what, as with what instrument, and\nwith what result;[4] as that of preservation, for instance, and how, as\nwhether softly or violently.\nAll these particulars, in one and the same case, no man in his senses\ncould be ignorant of; plainly not of the agent, being himself. But what\nhe is doing a man may be ignorant, as men in speaking say a thing\nescaped them unawares; or as Aeschylus did with respect to the\nMysteries, that he was not aware that it was unlawful to speak of them;\nor as in the case of that catapult accident the other day the man said\nhe discharged it merely to display its operation. Or a person might\nsuppose a son to be an enemy, as Merope did; or that the spear really\npointed was rounded off; or that the stone was a pumice; or in striking\nwith a view to save might kill; or might strike when merely wishing to\nshow another, as people do in sham-fighting.\nNow since ignorance is possible in respect to all these details in\nwhich the action consists, he that acted in ignorance of any of them is\nthought to have acted involuntarily, and he most so who was in\nignorance as regards the most important, which are thought to be those\nin which the action consists, and the result.\nFurther, not only must the ignorance be of this kind, to constitute an\naction involuntary, but it must be also understood that the action is\nfollowed by pain and regret.\nChapter III.\nNow since all involuntary action is either upon compulsion or by reason\nof ignorance, Voluntary Action would seem to be \u201cthat whose origination\nis in the agent, he being aware of the particular details in which the\naction consists.\u201d\nFor, it may be, men are not justified by calling those actions\ninvoluntary, which are done by reason of Anger or Lust.\nBecause, in the first place, if this be so no other animal but man, and\nnot even children, can be said to act voluntarily. Next, is it meant\nthat we never act voluntarily when we act from Lust or Anger, or that\nwe act voluntarily in doing what is right and involuntarily in doing\nwhat is discreditable? The latter supposition is absurd, since the\ncause is one and the same. Then as to the former, it is a strange thing\nto maintain actions to be involuntary which we are bound to grasp at:\nnow there are occasions on which anger is a duty,[5] and there are\nthings which we are bound to lust after,[6] health, for instance, and\nlearning.\nAgain, whereas actions strictly involuntary are thought to be attended\nwith pain, those which are done to gratify lust are thought to be\npleasant.\nAgain: how does the involuntariness make any difference[7] between\nwrong actions done from deliberate calculation, and those done by\nreason of anger? for both ought to be avoided, and the irrational\nfeelings are thought to be just as natural to man as reason, and so of\ncourse must be such actions of the individual as are done from Anger\nand Lust. It is absurd then to class these actions among the\ninvoluntary.\nChapter IV.\nHaving thus drawn out the distinction between voluntary and involuntary\naction our next step is to examine into the nature of Moral Choice,\nbecause this seems most intimately connected with Virtue and to be a\nmore decisive test of moral character than a man\u2019s acts are.\nNow Moral Choice is plainly voluntary, but the two are not\nco-extensive, voluntary being the more comprehensive term; for first,\nchildren and all other animals share in voluntary action but not in\nMoral Choice; and next, sudden actions we call voluntary but do not\nascribe them to Moral Choice.\nNor do they appear to be right who say it is lust or anger, or wish, or\nopinion of a certain kind; because, in the first place, Moral Choice is\nnot shared by the irrational animals while Lust and Anger are. Next;\nthe man who fails of self-control acts from Lust but not from Moral\nChoice; the man of self-control, on the contrary, from Moral Choice,\nnot from Lust. Again: whereas Lust is frequently opposed to Moral\nChoice, Lust is not to Lust.\nLastly: the object-matter of Lust is the pleasant and the painful, but\nof Moral Choice neither the one nor the other. Still less can it be\nAnger, because actions done from Anger are thought generally to be\nleast of all consequent on Moral Choice.\nNor is it Wish either, though appearing closely connected with it;\nbecause, in the first place, Moral Choice has not for its objects\nimpossibilities, and if a man were to say he chose them he would be\nthought to be a fool; but Wish may have impossible things for its\nobjects, immortality for instance.\nWish again may be exercised on things in the accomplishment of which\none\u2019s self could have nothing to do, as the success of any particular\nactor or athlete; but no man chooses things of this nature, only such\nas he believes he may himself be instrumental in procuring.\nFurther: Wish has for its object the End rather, but Moral Choice the\nmeans to the End; for instance, we wish to be healthy but we choose the\nmeans which will make us so; or happiness again we wish for, and\ncommonly say so, but to say we choose is not an appropriate term,\nbecause, in short, the province of Moral Choice seems to be those\nthings which are in our own power.\nNeither can it be Opinion; for Opinion is thought to be unlimited in\nits range of objects, and to be exercised as well upon things eternal\nand impossible as on those which are in our own power: again, Opinion\nis logically divided into true and false, not into good and bad as\nMoral Choice is.\nHowever, nobody perhaps maintains its identity with Opinion simply; but\nit is not the same with opinion of any kind,[8] because by choosing good\nand bad things we are constituted of a certain character, but by having\nopinions on them we are not.\nAgain, we choose to take or avoid, and so on, but we opine what a thing\nis, or for what it is serviceable, or how; but we do not opine to take\nor avoid.\nFurther, Moral Choice is commended rather for having a right object\nthan for being judicious, but Opinion for being formed in accordance\nwith truth.\nAgain, we choose such things as we pretty well know to be good, but we\nform opinions respecting such as we do not know at all.\nAnd it is not thought that choosing and opining best always go\ntogether, but that some opine the better course and yet by reason of\nviciousness choose not the things which they should.\nIt may be urged, that Opinion always precedes or accompanies Moral\nChoice; be it so, this makes no difference, for this is not the point\nin question, but whether Moral Choice is the same as Opinion of a\ncertain kind.\nSince then it is none of the aforementioned things, what is it, or how\nis it characterised? Voluntary it plainly is, but not all voluntary\naction is an object of Moral Choice. May we not say then, it is \u201cthat\nvoluntary which has passed through a stage of previous deliberation?\u201d\nbecause Moral Choice is attended with reasoning and intellectual\nprocess. The etymology of its Greek name seems to give a hint of it,\nbeing when analysed \u201cchosen in preference to somewhat else.\u201d\nChapter V.\nWell then; do men deliberate about everything, and is anything soever\nthe object of Deliberation, or are there some matters with respect to\nwhich there is none? (It may be as well perhaps to say, that by \u201cobject\nof Deliberation\u201d is meant such matter as a sensible man would\ndeliberate upon, not what any fool or madman might.)\nWell: about eternal things no one deliberates; as, for instance, the\nuniverse, or the incommensurability of the diameter and side of a\nsquare.\nNor again about things which are in motion but which always happen in\nthe same way either necessarily, or naturally, or from some other\ncause, as the solstices or the sunrise.\nNor about those which are variable, as drought and rains; nor\nfortuitous matters, as finding of treasure.\nNor in fact even about all human affairs; no Laced\u00e6monian, for\ninstance, deliberates as to the best course for the Scythian government\nto adopt; because in such cases we have no power over the result.\nBut we do deliberate respecting such practical matters as are in our\nown power (which are what are left after all our exclusions).\nI have adopted this division because causes seem to be divisible into\nnature, necessity, chance, and moreover intellect, and all human\npowers.\nAnd as man in general deliberates about what man in general can effect,\nso individuals do about such practical things as can be effected\nthrough their own instrumentality.\nAgain, we do not deliberate respecting such arts or sciences as are\nexact and independent: as, for instance, about written characters,\nbecause we have no doubt how they should be formed; but we do\ndeliberate on all buch things as are usually done through our own\ninstrumentality, but not invariably in the same way; as, for instance,\nabout matters connected with the healing art, or with money-making;\nand, again, more about piloting ships than gymnastic exercises, because\nthe former has been less exactly determined, and so forth; and more\nabout arts than sciences, because we more frequently doubt respecting\nthe former.\nSo then Deliberation takes place in such matters as are under general\nlaws, but still uncertain how in any given case they will issue, _i.e._\nin which there is some indefiniteness; and for great matters we\nassociate coadjutors in counsel, distrusting our ability to settle them\nalone.\nFurther, we deliberate not about Ends, but Means to Ends. No physician,\nfor instance, deliberates whether he will cure, nor orator whether he\nwill persuade, nor statesman whether he will produce a good\nconstitution, nor in fact any man in any other function about his\nparticular End; but having set before them a certain End they look how\nand through what means it may be accomplished: if there is a choice of\nmeans, they examine further which are easiest and most creditable; or,\nif there is but one means of accomplishing the object, then how it may\nbe through this, this again through what, till they come to the first\ncause; and this will be the last found; for a man engaged in a process\nof deliberation seems to seek and analyse, as a man, to solve a\nproblem, analyses the figure given him. And plainly not every search is\nDeliberation, those in mathematics to wit, but every Deliberation is a\nsearch, and the last step in the analysis is the first in the\nconstructive process. And if in the course of their search men come\nupon an impossibility, they give it up; if money, for instance, be\nnecessary, but cannot be got: but if the thing appears possible they\nthen attempt to do it.\nAnd by possible I mean what may be done through our own instrumentality\n(of course what may be done through our friends is through our own\ninstrumentality in a certain sense, because the origination in such\ncases rests with us). And the object of search is sometimes the\nnecessary instruments, sometimes the method of using them; and\nsimilarly in the rest sometimes through what, and sometimes how or\nthrough what.[9]\nSo it seems, as has been said, that Man is the originator of his\nactions; and Deliberation has for its object whatever may be done\nthrough one\u2019s own instrumentality, and the actions are with a view to\nother things; and so it is, not the End, but the Means to Ends on which\nDeliberation is employed.\nNor, again, is it employed on matters of detail, as whether the\nsubstance before me is bread, or has been properly cooked; for these\ncome under the province of sense, and if a man is to be always\ndeliberating, he may go on _ad infinitum_.\nFurther, exactly the same matter is the object both of Deliberation and\nMoral Choice; but that which is the object of Moral Choice is\nthenceforward separated off and definite,[10] because by object of\nMoral Choice is denoted that which after Deliberation has been\npreferred to something else: for each man leaves off searching how he\nshall do a thing when he has brought the origination up to himself,\n_i.e_. to the governing principle in himself,[11] because it is this\nwhich makes the choice. A good illustration of this is furnished by the\nold regal constitutions which Homer drew from, in which the Kings would\nannounce to the commonalty what they had determined before.\nNow since that which is the object of Moral Choice is something in our\nown power, which is the object of deliberation and the grasping of the\nWill, Moral Choice must be \u201ca grasping after something in our own power\nconsequent upon Deliberation:\u201d because after having deliberated we\ndecide, and then grasp by our Will in accordance with the result of our\ndeliberation.[12]\nLet this be accepted as a sketch of the nature and object of Moral\nChoice, that object being \u201cMeans to Ends.\u201d\nChapter VI.\nThat Wish has for its object-matter the End, has been already stated;\nbut there are two opinions respecting it; some thinking that its object\nis real good, others whatever impresses the mind with a notion of good.\nNow those who maintain that the object of Wish is real good are beset\nby this difficulty, that what is wished for by him who chooses wrongly\nis not really an object of Wish (because, on their theory, if it is an\nobject of wish, it must be good, but it is, in the case supposed,\nevil). Those who maintain, on the contrary, that that which impresses\nthe mind with a notion of good is properly the object of Wish, have to\nmeet this difficulty, that there is nothing naturally an object of Wish\nbut to each individual whatever seems good to him; now different people\nhave different notions, and it may chance contrary ones.\nBut, if these opinions do not satisfy us, may we not say that,\nabstractedly and as a matter of objective truth, the really good is the\nobject of Wish, but to each individual whatever impresses his mind with\nthe notion of good.[13] And so to the good man that is an object of\nWish which is really and truly so, but to the bad man anything may be;\njust as physically those things are wholesome to the healthy which are\nreally so, but other things to the sick. And so too of bitter and\nsweet, and hot and heavy, and so on. For the good man judges in every\ninstance correctly, and in every instance the notion conveyed to his\nmind is the true one.\nFor there are fair and pleasant things peculiar to, and so varying\nwith, each state; and perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of\nthe good man is his seeing the truth in every instance, he being, in\nfact, the rule and measure of these matters.\nThe multitude of men seem to be deceived by reason of pleasure, because\nthough it is not really a good it impresses their minds with the notion\nof goodness, so they choose what is pleasant as good and avoid pain as\nan evil.\nChapter VII.\nNow since the End is the object of Wish, and the means to the End of\nDeliberation and Moral Choice, the actions regarding these matters must\nbe in the way of Moral Choice, _i.e._ voluntary: but the acts of\nworking out the virtues are such actions, and therefore Virtue is in\nour power.\nAnd so too is Vice: because wherever it is in our power to do it is\nalso in our power to forbear doing, and _vice vers\u00e2_: therefore if the\ndoing (being in a given case creditable) is in our power, so too is the\nforbearing (which is in the same case discreditable), and _vice vers\u00e2_.\nBut if it is in our power to do and to forbear doing what is creditable\nor the contrary, and these respectively constitute the being good or\nbad, then the being good or vicious characters is in our power.\nAs for the well-known saying, \u201cNo man voluntarily is wicked or\ninvoluntarily happy,\u201d it is partly true, partly false; for no man is\nhappy against his will, of course, but wickedness is voluntary. Or must\nwe dispute the statements lately made, and not say that Man is the\noriginator or generator of his actions as much as of his children?\nBut if this is matter of plain manifest fact, and we cannot refer our\nactions to any other originations beside those in our own power, those\nthings must be in our own power, and so voluntary, the originations of\nwhich are in ourselves.\nMoreover, testimony seems to be borne to these positions both privately\nby individuals, and by law-givers too, in that they chastise and punish\nthose who do wrong (unless they do so on compulsion, or by reason of\nignorance which is not self-caused), while they honour those who act\nrightly, under the notion of being likely to encourage the latter and\nrestrain the former. But such things as are not in our own power,\n_i.e._ not voluntary, no one thinks of encouraging us to do, knowing it\nto be of no avail for one to have been persuaded not to be hot (for\ninstance), or feel pain, or be hungry, and so forth, because we shall\nhave those sensations all the same.\nAnd what makes the case stronger is this: that they chastise for the\nvery fact of ignorance, when it is thought to be self-caused; to the\ndrunken, for instance, penalties are double, because the origination in\nsuch case lies in a man\u2019s own self: for he might have helped getting\ndrunk, and this is the cause of his ignorance.\nAgain, those also who are ignorant of legal regulations which they are\nbound to know, and which are not hard to know, they chastise; and\nsimilarly in all other cases where neglect is thought to be the cause\nof the ignorance, under the notion that it was in their power to\nprevent their ignorance, because they might have paid attention.\nBut perhaps a man is of such a character that he cannot attend to such\nthings: still men are themselves the causes of having become such\ncharacters by living carelessly, and also of being unjust or destitute\nof self-control, the former by doing evil actions, the latter by\nspending their time in drinking and such-like; because the particular\nacts of working form corresponding characters, as is shown by those who\nare practising for any contest or particular course of action, for such\nmen persevere in the acts of working.\nAs for the plea, that a man did not know that habits are produced from\nseparate acts of working, we reply, such ignorance is a mark of\nexcessive stupidity.\nFurthermore, it is wholly irrelevant to say that the man who acts\nunjustly or dissolutely does not _wish_ to attain the habits of these\nvices: for if a man wittingly does those things whereby he must become\nunjust he is to all intents and purposes unjust voluntarily; but he\ncannot with a wish cease to be unjust and become just. For, to take the\nanalogous case, the sick man cannot with a wish be well again, yet in a\nsupposable case he is voluntarily ill because he has produced his\nsickness by living intemperately and disregarding his physicians. There\nwas a time then when he might have helped being ill, but now he has let\nhimself go he cannot any longer; just as he who has let a stone out of\nhis hand cannot recall it,[14] and yet it rested with him to aim and\nthrow it, because the origination was in his power. Just so the unjust\nman, and he who has lost all self-control, might originally have helped\nbeing what they are, and so they are voluntarily what they are; but now\nthat they are become so they no longer have the power of being\notherwise.\nAnd not only are mental diseases voluntary, but the bodily are so in\nsome men, whom we accordingly blame: for such as are naturally deformed\nno one blames, only such as are so by reason of want of exercise, and\nneglect: and so too of weakness and maiming: no one would think of\nupbraiding, but would rather compassionate, a man who is blind by\nnature, or from disease, or from an accident; but every one would blame\nhim who was so from excess of wine, or any other kind of intemperance.\nIt seems, then, that in respect of bodily diseases, those which depend\non ourselves are censured, those which do not are not censured; and if\nso, then in the case of the mental disorders, those which are censured\nmust depend upon ourselves.\nBut suppose a man to say, \u201cthat (by our own admission) all men aim at\nthat which conveys to their minds an impression of good, and that men\nhave no control over this impression, but that the End impresses each\nwith a notion correspondent to his own individual character; that to be\nsure if each man is in a way the cause of his own moral state, so he\nwill be also of the kind of impression he receives: whereas, if this is\nnot so, no one is the cause to himself of doing evil actions, but he\ndoes them by reason of ignorance of the true End, supposing that\nthrough their means he will secure the chief good. Further, that this\naiming at the End is no matter of one\u2019s own choice, but one must be\nborn with a power of mental vision, so to speak, whereby to judge\nfairly and choose that which is really good; and he is blessed by\nnature who has this naturally well: because it is the most important\nthing and the fairest, and what a man cannot get or learn from another\nbut will have such as nature has given it; and for this to be so given\nwell and fairly would be excellence of nature in the highest and truest\nsense.\u201d\nIf all this be true, how will Virtue be a whit more voluntary than\nVice? Alike to the good man and the bad, the End gives its impression\nand is fixed by nature or howsoever you like to say, and they act so\nand so, referring everything else to this End.\nWhether then we suppose that the End impresses each man\u2019s mind with\ncertain notions not merely by nature, but that there is somewhat also\ndependent on himself; or that the End is given by nature, and yet\nVirtue is voluntary because the good man does all the rest voluntarily,\nVice must be equally so; because his own agency equally attaches to the\nbad man in the actions, even if not in the selection of the End.\nIf then, as is commonly said, the Virtues are voluntary (because we at\nleast cooperate[15] in producing our moral states, and we assume the\nEnd to be of a certain kind according as we are ourselves of certain\ncharacters), the Vices must be voluntary also, because the cases are\nexactly similar.\nChapter VIII.\nWell now, we have stated generally respecting the Moral Virtues, the\ngenus (in outline), that they are mean states, and that they are\nhabits, and how they are formed, and that they are of themselves\ncalculated to act upon the circumstances out of which they were formed,\nand that they are in our own power and voluntary, and are to be done so\nas right Reason may direct.\nBut the particular actions and the habits are not voluntary in the same\nsense; for of the actions we are masters from beginning to end\n(supposing of course a knowledge of the particular details), but only\nof the origination of the habits, the addition by small particular\naccessions not being cognisiable (as is the case with sicknesses):\nstill they are voluntary because it rested with us to use our\ncircumstances this way or that.\nChapter IX.\nHere we will resume the particular discussion of the Moral Virtues, and\nsay what they are, what is their object-matter, and how they stand\nrespectively related to it: of course their number will be thereby\nshown.\nFirst, then, of Courage. Now that it is a mean state, in respect of\nfear and boldness, has been already said: further, the objects of our\nfears are obviously things fearful or, in a general way of statement,\nevils; which accounts for the common definition of fear, viz.\n\u201cexpectation of evil.\u201d\nOf course we fear evils of all kinds: disgrace, for instance, poverty,\ndisease, desolateness, death; but not all these seem to be the\nobject-matter of the Brave man, because there are things which to fear\nis right and noble, and not to fear is base; disgrace, for example,\nsince he who fears this is a good man and has a sense of honour, and he\nwho does not fear it is shameless (though there are those who call him\nBrave by analogy, because he somewhat resembles the Brave man who\nagrees with him in being free from fear); but poverty, perhaps, or\ndisease, and in fact whatever does not proceed from viciousness, nor is\nattributable to his own fault, a man ought not to fear: still, being\nfearless in respect of these would not constitute a man Brave in the\nproper sense of the term.\nYet we do apply the term[16] in right of the similarity of the cases;\nfor there are men who, though timid in the dangers of war, are liberal\nmen and are stout enough to face loss of wealth.\nAnd, again, a man is not a coward for fearing insult to his wife or\nchildren, or envy, or any such thing; nor is he a Brave man for being\nbold when going to be scourged.\nWhat kind of fearful things then do constitute the object-matter of the\nBrave man? first of all, must they not be the greatest, since no man is\nmore apt to withstand what is dreadful. Now the object of the greatest\ndread is death, because it is the end of all things, and the dead man\nis thought to be capable neither of good nor evil. Still it would seem\nthat the Brave man has not for his object-matter even death in every\ncircumstance; on the sea, for example, or in sickness: in what\ncircumstances then? must it not be in the most honourable? now such is\ndeath in war, because it is death in the greatest and most honourable\ndanger; and this is confirmed by the honours awarded in communities,\nand by monarchs.\nHe then may be most properly denominated Brave who is fearless in\nrespect of honourable death and such sudden emergencies as threaten\ndeath; now such specially are those which arise in the course of war.\nIt is not meant but that the Brave man will be fearless also on the sea\n(and in sickness), but not in the same way as sea-faring men; for these\nare light-hearted and hopeful by reason of their experience, while\nlandsmen though Brave are apt to give themselves up for lost and\nshudder at the notion of such a death: to which it should be added that\nCourage is exerted in circumstances which admit of doing something to\nhelp one\u2019s self, or in which death would be honourable; now neither of\nthese requisites attach to destruction by drowning or sickness.\nChapter X.\nAgain, fearful is a term of relation, the same thing not being so to\nall, and there is according to common parlance somewhat so fearful as\nto be beyond human endurance: this of course would be fearful to every\nman of sense, but those objects which are level to the capacity of man\ndiffer in magnitude and admit of degrees, so too the objects of\nconfidence or boldness.\nNow the Brave man cannot be frighted from his propriety (but of course\nonly so far as he is man); fear such things indeed he will, but he will\nstand up against them as he ought and as right reason may direct, with\na view to what is honourable, because this is the end of the virtue.\nNow it is possible to fear these things too much, or too little, or\nagain to fear what is not really fearful as if it were such. So the\nerrors come to be either that a man fears when he ought not to fear at\nall, or that he fears in an improper way, or at a wrong time, and so\nforth; and so too in respect of things inspiring confidence. He is\nBrave then who withstands, and fears, and is bold, in respect of right\nobjects, from a right motive, in right manner, and at right times:\nsince the Brave man suffers or acts as he ought and as right reason may\ndirect.\nNow the end of every separate act of working is that which accords with\nthe habit, and so to the Brave man Courage; which is honourable;\ntherefore such is also the End, since the character of each is\ndetermined by the End.[17]\nSo honour is the motive from which the Brave man withstands things\nfearful and performs the acts which accord with Courage.\nOf the characters on the side of Excess, he who exceeds in utter\nabsence of fear has no appropriate name (I observed before that many\nstates have none), but he would be a madman or inaccessible to pain if\nhe feared nothing, neither earthquake, nor the billows, as they tell of\nthe Celts.\nHe again who exceeds in confidence in respect of things fearful is\nrash. He is thought moreover to be a braggart, and to advance unfounded\nclaims to the character of Brave: the relation which the Brave man\nreally bears to objects of fear this man wishes to appear to bear, and\nso imitates him in whatever points he can; for this reason most of them\nexhibit a curious mixture of rashness and cowardice; because, affecting\nrashness in these circumstances, they do not withstand what is truly\nfearful.\nThe man moreover who exceeds in feeling fear is a coward, since there\nattach to him the circumstances of fearing wrong objects, in wrong\nways, and so forth. He is deficient also in feeling confidence, but he\nis most clearly seen as exceeding in the case of pains; he is a\nfainthearted kind of man, for he fears all things: the Brave man is\njust the contrary, for boldness is the property of the light-hearted\nand hopeful.\nSo the coward, the rash, and the Brave man have exactly the same\nobject-matter, but stand differently related to it: the two\nfirst-mentioned respectively exceed and are deficient, the last is in a\nmean state and as he ought to be. The rash again are precipitate, and,\nbeing eager before danger, when actually in it fall away, while the\nBrave are quick and sharp in action, but before are quiet and composed.\nWell then, as has been said, Courage is a mean state in respect of\nobjects inspiring boldness or fear, in the circumstances which have\nbeen stated, and the Brave man chooses his line and withstands danger\neither because to do so is honourable, or because not to do so is base.\nBut dying to escape from poverty, or the pangs of love, or anything\nthat is simply painful, is the act not of a Brave man but of a coward;\nbecause it is mere softness to fly from what is toilsome, and the\nsuicide braves the terrors of death not because it is honourable but to\nget out of the reach of evil.\nChapter XI.\nCourage proper is somewhat of the kind I have described, but there are\ndispositions, differing in five ways,[18] which also bear in common\nparlance the name of Courage.\nWe will take first that which bears most resemblance to the true, the\nCourage of Citizenship, so named because the motives which are thought\nto actuate the members of a community in braving danger are the\npenalties and disgrace held out by the laws to cowardice, and the\ndignities conferred on the Brave; which is thought to be the reason why\nthose are the bravest people among whom cowards are visited with\ndisgrace and the Brave held in honour.\nSuch is the kind of Courage Homer exhibits in his characters; Diomed\nand Hector for example. The latter says,\n\u201cPolydamas will be the first to fix\nDisgrace upon me.\u201d\nDiomed again,\n\u201cFor Hector surely will hereafter say,\nSpeaking in Troy, Tydides by my hand\u201d\u2014\nThis I say most nearly resembles the Courage before spoken of, because\nit arises from virtue, from a feeling of shame, and a desire of what is\nnoble (that is, of honour), and avoidance of disgrace which is base.\nIn the same rank one would be inclined to place those also who act\nunder compulsion from their commanders; yet are they really lower,\nbecause not a sense of honour but fear is the motive from which they\nact, and what they seek to avoid is not that which is base but that\nwhich is simply painful: commanders do in fact compel their men\nsometimes, as Hector says (to quote Homer again),\n\u201cBut whomsoever I shall find cowering afar from the fight,\nThe teeth of dogs he shall by no means escape.\u201d\nThose commanders who station staunch troops by doubtful ones,[19] or\nwho beat their men if they flinch, or who draw their troops up in line\nwith the trenches, or other similar obstacles, in their rear, do in\neffect the same as Hector, for they all use compulsion.\nBut a man is to be Brave, not on compulsion, but from a sense of\nhonour.\nIn the next place, Experience and Skill in the various particulars is\nthought to be a species of Courage: whence Socrates also thought that\nCourage was knowledge.[20]\nThis quality is exhibited of course by different men under different\ncircumstances, but in warlike matters, with which we are now concerned,\nit is exhibited by the soldiers (\u201cthe regulars\u201d): for there are, it\nwould seem, many things in war of no real importance[21] which these\nhave been constantly used to see; so they have a show of Courage\nbecause other people are not aware of the real nature of these things.\nThen again by reason of their skill they are better able than any\nothers to inflict without suffering themselves, because they are able\nto use their arms and have such as are most serviceable both with a\nview to offence and defence: so that their case is parallel to that of\narmed men fighting with unarmed or trained athletes with amateurs,\nsince in contests of this kind those are the best fighters, not who are\nthe bravest men, but who are the strongest and are in the best\ncondition.\nIn fact, the regular troops come to be cowards whenever the danger is\ngreater than their means of meeting it; supposing, for example, that\nthey are inferior in numbers and resources: then they are the first to\nfly, but the mere militia stand and fall on the ground (which as you\nknow really happened at the Herm\u00e6um),[22] for in the eyes of these\nflight was disgraceful and death preferable to safety bought at such a\nprice: while \u201cthe regulars\u201d originally went into the danger under a\nnotion of their own superiority, but on discovering their error they\ntook to flight,[23] having greater fear of death than of disgrace; but\nthis is not the feeling of the Brave man.\nThirdly, mere Animal Spirit is sometimes brought under the term\nCourage: they are thought to be Brave who are carried on by mere Animal\nSpirit, as are wild beasts against those who have wounded them, because\nin fact the really Brave have much Spirit, there being nothing like it\nfor going at danger of any kind; whence those frequent expressions in\nHomer, \u201cinfused strength into his spirit,\u201d \u201croused his strength and\nspirit,\u201d or again, \u201cand keen strength in his nostrils,\u201d \u201chis blood\nboiled:\u201d for all these seem to denote the arousing and impetuosity of\nthe Animal Spirit.\nNow they that are truly Brave act from a sense of honour, and this\nAnimal Spirit co-operates with them; but wild beasts from pain, that is\nbecause they have been wounded, or are frightened; since if they are\nquietly in their own haunts, forest or marsh, they do not attack men.\nSurely they are not Brave because they rush into danger when goaded on\nby pain and mere Spirit, without any view of the danger: else would\nasses be Brave when they are hungry, for though beaten they will not\nthen leave their pasture: profligate men besides do many bold actions\nby reason of their lust. We may conclude then that they are not Brave\nwho are goaded on to meet danger by pain and mere Spirit; but still\nthis temper which arises from Animal Spirit appears to be most natural,\nand would be Courage of the true kind if it could have added to it\nmoral choice and the proper motive.\nSo men also are pained by a feeling of anger, and take pleasure in\nrevenge; but they who fight from these causes may be good fighters, but\nthey are not truly Brave (in that they do not act from a sense of\nhonour, nor as reason directs, but merely from the present feeling),\nstill they bear some resemblance to that character.\nNor, again, are the Sanguine and Hopeful therefore Brave: since their\nboldness in dangers arises from their frequent victories over numerous\nfoes. The two characters are alike, however, in that both are\nconfident; but then the Brave are so from the afore-mentioned causes,\nwhereas these are so from a settled conviction of their being superior\nand not likely to suffer anything in return (they who are intoxicated\ndo much the same, for they become hopeful when in that state); but when\nthe event disappoints their expectations they run away: now it was said\nto be the character of a Brave man to withstand things which are\nfearful to man or produce that impression, because it is honourable so\nto do and the contrary is dishonourable.\nFor this reason it is thought to be a greater proof of Courage to be\nfearless and undisturbed under the pressure of sudden fear than under\nthat which may be anticipated, because Courage then comes rather from a\nfixed habit, or less from preparation: since as to foreseen dangers a\nman might take his line even from calculation and reasoning, but in\nthose which are sudden he will do so according to his fixed habit of\nmind.\nFifthly and lastly, those who are acting under Ignorance have a show of\nCourage and are not very far from the Hopeful; but still they are\ninferior inasmuch as they have no opinion of themselves; which the\nothers have, and therefore stay and contest a field for some little\ntime; but they who have been deceived fly the moment they know things\nto be otherwise than they supposed, which the Argives experienced when\nthey fell on the Laced\u00e6monians, taking them for the men of Sicyon.\nChapter XII.\nWe have described then what kind of men the Brave are, and what they\nwho are thought to be, but are not really, Brave.\nIt must be remarked, however, that though Courage has for its\nobject-matter boldness and fear it has not both equally so, but objects\nof fear much more than the former; for he that under pressure of these\nis undisturbed and stands related to them as he ought is better\nentitled to the name of Brave than he who is properly affected towards\nobjects of confidence. So then men are termed Brave for withstanding\npainful things.\nIt follows that Courage involves pain and is justly praised, since it\nis a harder matter to withstand things that are painful than to abstain\nfrom such as are pleasant.\nIt must not be thought but that the End and object of Courage is\npleasant, but it is obscured by the surrounding circumstances: which\nhappens also in the gymnastic games; to the boxers the End is pleasant\nwith a view to which they act, I mean the crown and the honours; but\nthe receiving the blows they do is painful and annoying to flesh and\nblood, and so is all the labour they have to undergo; and, as these\ndrawbacks are many, the object in view being small appears to have no\npleasantness in it.\nIf then we may say the same of Courage, of course death and wounds must\nbe painful to the Brave man and against his will: still he endures\nthese because it is honourable so to do or because it is dishonourable\nnot to do so. And the more complete his virtue and his happiness so\nmuch the more will he be pained at the notion of death: since to such a\nman as he is it is best worth while to live, and he with full\nconsciousness is deprived of the greatest goods by death, and this is a\npainful idea. But he is not the less Brave for feeling it to be so, nay\nrather it may be he is shown to be more so because he chooses the\nhonour that may be reaped in war in preference to retaining safe\npossession of these other goods. The fact is that to act with pleasure\ndoes not belong to all the virtues, except so far as a man realises the\nEnd of his actions.\nBut there is perhaps no reason why not such men should make the best\nsoldiers, but those who are less truly Brave but have no other good to\ncare for: these being ready to meet danger and bartering their lives\nagainst small gain.\nLet thus much be accepted as sufficient on the subject of Courage; the\ntrue nature of which it is not difficult to gather, in outline at\nleast, from what has been said.\nChapter XIII.\nNext let us speak of Perfected Self-Mastery, which seems to claim the\nnext place to Courage, since these two are the Excellences of the\nIrrational part of the Soul.\nThat it is a mean state, having for its object-matter Pleasures, we\nhave already said (Pains being in fact its object-matter in a less\ndegree and dissimilar manner), the state of utter absence of\nself-control has plainly the same object-matter; the next thing then is\nto determine what kind of Pleasures.\nLet Pleasures then be understood to be divided into mental and bodily:\ninstances of the former being love of honour or of learning: it being\nplain that each man takes pleasure in that of these two objects which\nhe has a tendency to like, his body being no way affected but rather\nhis intellect. Now men are not called perfectly self-mastering or\nwholly destitute of self-control in respect of pleasures of this class:\nnor in fact in respect of any which are not bodily; those for example\nwho love to tell long stories, and are prosy, and spend their days\nabout mere chance matters, we call gossips but not wholly destitute of\nself-control, nor again those who are pained at the loss of money or\nfriends.\nIt is bodily Pleasures then which are the object-matter of Perfected\nSelf-Mastery, but not even all these indifferently: I mean, that they\nwho take pleasure in objects perceived by the Sight, as colours, and\nforms, and painting, are not denominated men of Perfected Self-Mastery,\nor wholly destitute of self-control; and yet it would seem that one may\ntake pleasure even in such objects, as one ought to do, or excessively,\nor too little.\nSo too of objects perceived by the sense of Hearing; no one applies the\nterms before quoted respectively to those who are excessively pleased\nwith musical tunes or acting, or to those who take such pleasure as\nthey ought.\nNor again to those persons whose pleasure arises from the sense of\nSmell, except incidentally:[24] I mean, we do not say men have no\nself-control because they take pleasure in the scent of fruit, or\nflowers, or incense, but rather when they do so in the smells of\nunguents and sauces: since men destitute of self-control take pleasure\nherein, because hereby the objects of their lusts are recalled to their\nimagination (you may also see other men take pleasure in the smell of\nfood when they are hungry): but to take pleasure in such is a mark of\nthe character before named since these are objects of desire to him.\nNow not even brutes receive pleasure in right of these senses, except\nincidentally. I mean, it is not the scent of hares\u2019 flesh but the\neating it which dogs take pleasure in, perception of which pleasure is\ncaused by the sense of Smell. Or again, it is not the lowing of the ox\nbut eating him which the lion likes; but of the fact of his nearness\nthe lion is made sensible by the lowing, and so he appears to take\npleasure in this. In like manner, he has no pleasure in merely seeing\nor finding a stag or wild goat, but in the prospect of a meal.\nThe habits of Perfect Self-Mastery and entire absence of self-control\nhave then for their object-matter such pleasures as brutes also share\nin, for which reason they are plainly servile and brutish: they are\nTouch and Taste.\nBut even Taste men seem to make little or no use of; for to the sense\nof Taste belongs the distinguishing of flavours; what men do, in fact,\nwho are testing the quality of wines or seasoning \u201cmade dishes.\u201d\nBut men scarcely take pleasure at all in these things, at least those\nwhom we call destitute of self-control do not, but only in the actual\nenjoyment which arises entirely from the sense of Touch, whether in\neating or in drinking, or in grosser lusts. This accounts for the wish\nsaid to have been expressed once by a great glutton, \u201cthat his throat\nhad been formed longer than a crane\u2019s neck,\u201d implying that his pleasure\nwas derived from the Touch.\nThe sense then with which is connected the habit of absence of\nself-control is the most common of all the senses, and this habit would\nseem to be justly a matter of reproach, since it attaches to us not in\nso far as we are men but in so far as we are animals. Indeed it is\nbrutish to take pleasure in such things and to like them best of all;\nfor the most respectable of the pleasures arising from the touch have\nbeen set aside; those, for instance, which occur in the course of\ngymnastic training from the rubbing and the warm bath: because the\ntouch of the man destitute of self-control is not indifferently of\n_any_ part of the body but only of particular parts.\nNow of lusts or desires some are thought to be universal, others\npeculiar and acquired; thus desire for food is natural since every one\nwho really needs desires also food, whether solid or liquid, or both\n(and, as Homer says, the man in the prime of youth needs and desires\nintercourse with the other sex); but when we come to this or that\nparticular kind, then neither is the desire universal nor in all men is\nit directed to the same objects. And therefore the conceiving of such\ndesires plainly attaches to us as individuals. It must be admitted,\nhowever, that there is something natural in it: because different\nthings are pleasant to different men and a preference of some\nparticular objects to chance ones is universal. Well then, in the case\nof the desires which are strictly and properly natural few men go wrong\nand all in one direction, that is, on the side of too much: I mean, to\neat and drink of such food as happens to be on the table till one is\noverfilled is exceeding in quantity the natural limit, since the\nnatural desire is simply a supply of a real deficiency.\nFor this reason these men are called belly-mad, as filling it beyond\nwhat they ought, and it is the slavish who become of this character.\nBut in respect of the peculiar pleasures many men go wrong and in many\ndifferent ways; for whereas the term \u201cfond of so and so\u201d implies either\ntaking pleasure in wrong objects, or taking pleasure excessively, or as\nthe mass of men do, or in a wrong way, they who are destitute of all\nself-control exceed in all these ways; that is to say, they take\npleasure in some things in which they ought not to do so (because they\nare properly objects of detestation), and in such as it is right to\ntake pleasure in they do so more than they ought and as the mass of men\ndo.\nWell then, that excess with respect to pleasures is absence of\nself-control, and blameworthy, is plain. But viewing these habits on\nthe side of pains, we find that a man is not said to have the virtue\nfor withstanding them (as in the case of Courage), nor the vice for not\nwithstanding them; but the man destitute of self-control is such,\nbecause he is pained more than he ought to be at not obtaining things\nwhich are pleasant (and thus his pleasure produces pain to him), and\nthe man of Perfected Self-Mastery is such in virtue of not being pained\nby their absence, that is, by having to abstain from what is pleasant.\nNow the man destitute of self-control desires either all pleasant\nthings indiscriminately or those which are specially pleasant, and he\nis impelled by his desire to choose these things in preference to all\nothers; and this involves pain, not only when he misses the attainment\nof his objects but, in the very desiring them, since all desire is\naccompanied by pain. Surely it is a strange case this, being pained by\nreason of pleasure.\nAs for men who are defective on the side of pleasure, who take less\npleasure in things than they ought, they are almost imaginary\ncharacters, because such absence of sensual perception is not natural\nto man: for even the other animals distinguish between different kinds\nof food, and like some kinds and dislike others. In fact, could a man\nbe found who takes no pleasure in anything and to whom all things are\nalike, he would be far from being human at all: there is no name for\nsuch a character because it is simply imaginary.\nBut the man of Perfected Self-Mastery is in the mean with respect to\nthese objects: that is to say, he neither takes pleasure in the things\nwhich delight the vicious man, and in fact rather dislikes them, nor at\nall in improper objects; nor to any great degree in any object of the\nclass; nor is he pained at their absence; nor does he desire them; or,\nif he does, only in moderation, and neither more than he ought, nor at\nimproper times, and so forth; but such things as are conducive to\nhealth and good condition of body, being also pleasant, these he will\ngrasp at in moderation and as he ought to do, and also such other\npleasant things as do not hinder these objects, and are not unseemly or\ndisproportionate to his means; because he that should grasp at such\nwould be liking such pleasures more than is proper; but the man of\nPerfected Self-Mastery is not of this character, but regulates his\ndesires by the dictates of right reason.\nChapter XIV.\nNow the vice of being destitute of all Self-Control seems to be more\ntruly voluntary than Cowardice, because pleasure is the cause of the\nformer and pain of the latter, and pleasure is an object of choice,\npain of avoidance. And again, pain deranges and spoils the natural\ndisposition of its victim, whereas pleasure has no such effect and is\nmore voluntary and therefore more justly open to reproach.\nIt is so also for the following reason; that it is easier to be inured\nby habit to resist the objects of pleasure, there being many things of\nthis kind in life and the process of habituation being unaccompanied by\ndanger; whereas the case is the reverse as regards the objects of fear.\nAgain, Cowardice as a confirmed habit would seem to be voluntary in a\ndifferent way from the particular instances which form the habit;\nbecause it is painless, but these derange the man by reason of pain so\nthat he throws away his arms and otherwise behaves himself unseemly,\nfor which reason they are even thought by some to exercise a power of\ncompulsion.\nBut to the man destitute of Self-Control the particular instances are\non the contrary quite voluntary, being done with desire and direct\nexertion of the will, but the general result is less voluntary: since\nno man desires to form the habit.\nThe name of this vice (which signifies etymologically unchastened-ness)\nwe apply also to the faults of children, there being a certain\nresemblance between the cases: to which the name is primarily applied,\nand to which secondarily or derivatively, is not relevant to the\npresent subject, but it is evident that the later in point of time must\nget the name from the earlier. And the metaphor seems to be a very good\none; for whatever grasps after base things, and is liable to great\nincrease, ought to be chastened; and to this description desire and the\nchild answer most truly, in that children also live under the direction\nof desire and the grasping after what is pleasant is most prominently\nseen in these.\nUnless then the appetite be obedient and subjected to the governing\nprinciple it will become very great: for in the fool the grasping after\nwhat is pleasant is insatiable and undiscriminating; and every acting\nout of the desire increases the kindred habit, and if the desires are\ngreat and violent in degree they even expel Reason entirely; therefore\nthey ought to be moderate and few, and in no respect to be opposed to\nReason. Now when the appetite is in such a state we denominate it\nobedient and chastened.\nIn short, as the child ought to live with constant regard to the orders\nof its educator, so should the appetitive principle with regard to\nthose of Reason.\nSo then in the man of Perfected Self-Mastery, the appetitive principle\nmust be accordant with Reason: for what is right is the mark at which\nboth principles aim: that is to say, the man of perfected self-mastery\ndesires what he ought in right manner and at right times, which is\nexactly what Reason directs. Let this be taken for our account of\nPerfected Self-Mastery.\nBOOK IV\nChapter I.\nWe will next speak of Liberality. Now this is thought to be the mean\nstate, having for its object-matter Wealth: I mean, the Liberal man is\npraised not in the circumstances of war, nor in those which constitute\nthe character of perfected self-mastery, nor again in judicial\ndecisions, but in respect of giving and receiving Wealth, chiefly the\nformer. By the term Wealth I mean \u201call those things whose worth is\nmeasured by money.\u201d\nNow the states of excess and defect in regard of Wealth are\nrespectively Prodigality and Stinginess: the latter of these terms we\nattach invariably to those who are over careful about Wealth, but the\nformer we apply sometimes with a complex notion; that is to say, we\ngive the name to those who fail of self-control and spend money on the\nunrestrained gratification of their passions; and this is why they are\nthought to be most base, because they have many vices at once.\nIt must be noted, however, that this is not a strict and proper use of\nthe term, since its natural etymological meaning is to denote him who\nhas one particular evil, viz. the wasting his substance: he is unsaved\n(as the term literally denotes) who is wasting away by his own fault;\nand this he really may be said to be; the destruction of his substance\nis thought to be a kind of wasting of himself, since these things are\nthe means of living. Well, this is our acceptation of the term\nProdigality.\nAgain. Whatever things are for use may be used well or ill, and Wealth\nbelongs to this class. He uses each particular thing best who has the\nvirtue to whose province it belongs: so that he will use Wealth best\nwho has the virtue respecting Wealth, that is to say, the Liberal man.\nExpenditure and giving are thought to be the using of money, but\nreceiving and keeping one would rather call the possessing of it. And\nso the giving to proper persons is more characteristic of the Liberal\nman, than the receiving from proper quarters and forbearing to receive\nfrom the contrary. In fact generally, doing well by others is more\ncharacteristic of virtue than being done well by, and doing things\npositively honourable than forbearing to do things dishonourable; and\nany one may see that the doing well by others and doing things\npositively honourable attaches to the act of giving, but to that of\nreceiving only the being done well by or forbearing to do what is\ndishonourable.\nBesides, thanks are given to him who gives, not to him who merely\nforbears to receive, and praise even more. Again, forbearing to receive\nis easier than giving, the case of being too little freehanded with\none\u2019s own being commoner than taking that which is not one\u2019s own.\nAnd again, it is they who give that are denominated Liberal, while they\nwho forbear to receive are commended, not on the score of Liberality\nbut of just dealing, while for receiving men are not, in fact, praised\nat all.\nAnd the Liberal are liked almost best of all virtuous characters,\nbecause they are profitable to others, and this their profitableness\nconsists in their giving.\nFurthermore: all the actions done in accordance with virtue are\nhonourable, and done from the motive of honour: and the Liberal man,\ntherefore, will give from a motive of honour, and will give rightly; I\nmean, to proper persons, in right proportion, at right times, and\nwhatever is included in the term \u201cright giving:\u201d and this too with\npositive pleasure, or at least without pain, since whatever is done in\naccordance with virtue is pleasant or at least not unpleasant, most\ncertainly not attended with positive pain.\nBut the man who gives to improper people, or not from a motive of\nhonour but from some other cause, shall be called not Liberal but\nsomething else. Neither shall he be so denominated who does it with\npain: this being a sign that he would prefer his wealth to the\nhonourable action, and this is no part of the Liberal man\u2019s character;\nneither will such an one receive from improper sources, because the so\nreceiving is not characteristic of one who values not wealth: nor again\nwill he be apt to ask, because one who does kindnesses to others does\nnot usually receive them willingly; but from proper sources (his own\nproperty, for instance) he will receive, doing this not as honourable\nbut as necessary, that he may have somewhat to give: neither will he be\ncareless of his own, since it is his wish through these to help others\nin need: nor will he give to chance people, that he may have wherewith\nto give to those to whom he ought, at right times, and on occasions\nwhen it is honourable so to do.\nAgain, it is a trait in the Liberal man\u2019s character even to exceed very\nmuch in giving so as to leave too little for himself, it being\ncharacteristic of such an one not to have a thought of self.\nNow Liberality is a term of relation to a man\u2019s means, for the\nLiberal-ness depends not on the amount of what is given but on the\nmoral state of the giver which gives in proportion to his means. There\nis then no reason why he should not be the more Liberal man who gives\nthe less amount, if he has less to give out of.\nAgain, they are thought to be more Liberal who have inherited, not\nacquired for themselves, their means; because, in the first place, they\nhave never experienced want, and next, all people love most their own\nworks, just as parents do and poets.\nIt is not easy for the Liberal man to be rich, since he is neither apt\nto receive nor to keep but to lavish, and values not wealth for its own\nsake but with a view to giving it away. Hence it is commonly charged\nupon fortune that they who most deserve to be rich are least so. Yet\nthis happens reasonably enough; it is impossible he should have wealth\nwho does not take any care to have it, just as in any similar case.\nYet he will not give to improper people, nor at wrong times, and so on:\nbecause he would not then be acting in accordance with Liberality, and\nif he spent upon such objects, would have nothing to spend on those on\nwhich he ought: for, as I have said before, he is Liberal who spends in\nproportion to his means, and on proper objects, while he who does so in\nexcess is prodigal (this is the reason why we never call despots\nprodigal, because it does not seem to be easy for them by their gifts\nand expenditure to go beyond their immense possessions).\nTo sum up then. Since Liberality is a mean state in respect of the\ngiving and receiving of wealth, the Liberal man will give and spend on\nproper objects, and in proper proportion, in great things and in small\nalike, and all this with pleasure to himself; also he will receive from\nright sources, and in right proportion: because, as the virtue is a\nmean state in respect of both, he will do both as he ought, and, in\nfact, upon proper giving follows the correspondent receiving, while\nthat which is not such is contrary to it. (Now those which follow one\nanother come to co-exist in the same person, those which are contraries\nplainly do not.)\nAgain, should it happen to him to spend money beyond what is needful,\nor otherwise than is well, he will be vexed, but only moderately and as\nhe ought; for feeling pleasure and pain at right objects, and in right\nmanner, is a property of Virtue.\nThe Liberal man is also a good man to have for a partner in respect of\nwealth: for he can easily be wronged, since he values not wealth, and\nis more vexed at not spending where he ought to have done so than at\nspending where he ought not, and he relishes not the maxim of\nSimonides.\nChapter II.\nBut the Prodigal man goes wrong also in these points, for he is neither\npleased nor pained at proper objects or in proper manner, which will\nbecome more plain as we proceed.\nWe have said already that Prodigality and Stinginess are respectively\nstates of excess and defect, and this in two things, giving and\nreceiving (expenditure of course we class under giving). Well now,\nProdigality exceeds in giving and forbearing to receive and is\ndeficient in receiving, while Stinginess is deficient in giving and\nexceeds in receiving, but it is in small things.\nThe two parts of Prodigality, to be sure, do not commonly go together;\nit is not easy, I mean, to give to all if you receive from none,\nbecause private individuals thus giving will soon find their means run\nshort, and such are in fact thought to be prodigal. He that should\ncombine both would seem to be no little superior to the Stingy man: for\nhe may be easily cured, both by advancing in years, and also by the\nwant of means, and he may come thus to the mean: he has, you see,\nalready the _facts_ of the Liberal man, he gives and forbears to\nreceive, only he does neither in right manner or well. So if he could\nbe wrought upon by habituation in this respect, or change in any other\nway, he would be a real Liberal man, for he will give to those to whom\nhe should, and will forbear to receive whence he ought not. This is the\nreason too why he is thought not to be low in moral character, because\nto exceed in giving and in forbearing to receive is no sign of badness\nor meanness, but only of folly.\nWell then, he who is Prodigal in this fashion is thought far superior\nto the Stingy man for the aforementioned reasons, and also because he\ndoes good to many, but the Stingy man to no one, not even to himself.\nBut most Prodigals, as has been said, combine with their other faults\nthat of receiving from improper sources, and on this point are Stingy:\nand they become grasping, because they wish to spend and cannot do this\neasily, since their means soon run short and they are necessitated to\nget from some other quarter; and then again, because they care not for\nwhat is honourable, they receive recklessly, and from all sources\nindifferently, because they desire to give but care not how or whence.\nAnd for this reason their givings are not Liberal, inasmuch as they are\nnot honourable, nor purely disinterested, nor done in right fashion;\nbut they oftentimes make those rich who should be poor, and to those\nwho are quiet respectable kind of people they will give nothing, but to\nflatterers, or those who subserve their pleasures in any way, they will\ngive much. And therefore most of them are utterly devoid of\nself-restraint; for as they are open-handed they are liberal in\nexpenditure upon the unrestrained gratification of their passions, and\nturn off to their pleasures because they do not live with reference to\nwhat is honourable.\nThus then the Prodigal, if unguided, slides into these faults; but if\nhe could get care bestowed on him he might come to the mean and to what\nis right.\nStinginess, on the contrary, is incurable: old age, for instance, and\nincapacity of any kind, is thought to make people Stingy; and it is\nmore congenial to human nature than Prodigality, the mass of men being\nfond of money rather than apt to give: moreover it extends far and has\nmany phases, the modes of stinginess being thought to be many. For as\nit consists of two things, defect of giving and excess of receiving,\neverybody does not have it entire, but it is sometimes divided, and one\nclass of persons exceed in receiving, the other are deficient in\ngiving. I mean those who are designated by such appellations as\nsparing, close-fisted, niggards, are all deficient in giving; but other\nmen\u2019s property they neither desire nor are willing to receive, in some\ninstances from a real moderation and shrinking from what is base.\nThere are some people whose motive, either supposed or alleged, for\nkeeping their property is this, that they may never be driven to do\nanything dishonourable: to this class belongs the skinflint, and every\none of similar character, so named from the excess of not-giving.\nOthers again decline to receive their neighbour\u2019s goods from a motive\nof fear; their notion being that it is not easy to take other people\u2019s\nthings yourself without their taking yours: so they are content neither\nto receive nor give.\nThe other class again who are Stingy in respect of receiving exceed in\nthat they receive anything from any source; such as they who work at\nilliberal employments, brothel keepers, and such-like, and usurers who\nlend small sums at large interest: for all these receive from improper\nsources, and improper amounts. Their common characteristic is\nbase-gaining, since they all submit to disgrace for the sake of gain\nand that small; because those who receive great things neither whence\nthey ought, nor what they ought (as for instance despots who sack\ncities and plunder temples), we denominate wicked, impious, and unjust,\nbut not Stingy.\nNow the dicer and bath-plunderer and the robber belong to the class of\nthe Stingy, for they are given to base gain: both busy themselves and\nsubmit to disgrace for the sake of gain, and the one class incur the\ngreatest dangers for the sake of their booty, while the others make\ngain of their friends to whom they ought to be giving.\nSo both classes, as wishing to make gain from improper sources, are\ngiven to base gain, and all such receivings are Stingy. And with good\nreason is Stinginess called the contrary of Liberality: both because it\nis a greater evil than Prodigality, and because men err rather in this\ndirection than in that of the Prodigality which we have spoken of as\nproperly and completely such.\nLet this be considered as what we have to say respecting Liberality and\nthe contrary vices.\nChapter III.\nNext in order would seem to come a dissertation on Magnificence, this\nbeing thought to be, like liberality, a virtue having for its\nobject-matter Wealth; but it does not, like that, extend to all\ntransactions in respect of Wealth, but only applies to such as are\nexpensive, and in these circumstances it exceeds liberality in respect\nof magnitude, because it is (what the very name in Greek hints at)\nfitting expense on a large scale: this term is of course relative: I\nmean, the expenditure of equipping and commanding a trireme is not the\nsame as that of giving a public spectacle: \u201cfitting\u201d of course also is\nrelative to the individual, and the matter wherein and upon which he\nhas to spend. And a man is not denominated Magnificent for spending as\nhe should do in small or ordinary things, as, for instance,\n\u201cOft to the wandering beggar did I give,\u201d\nbut for doing so in great matters: that is to say, the Magnificent man\nis liberal, but the liberal is not thereby Magnificent. The falling\nshort of such a state is called Meanness, the exceeding it Vulgar\nProfusion, Want of Taste, and so on; which are faulty, not because they\nare on an excessive scale in respect of right objects but, because they\nshow off in improper objects, and in improper manner: of these we will\nspeak presently. The Magnificent man is like a man of skill, because he\ncan see what is fitting, and can spend largely in good taste; for, as\nwe said at the commencement, the confirmed habit is determined by the\nseparate acts of working, and by its object-matter.\nWell, the expenses of the Magnificent man are great and fitting: such\nalso are his works (because this secures the expenditure being not\ngreat merely, but befitting the work). So then the work is to be\nproportionate to the expense, and this again to the work, or even above\nit: and the Magnificent man will incur such expenses from the motive of\nhonour, this being common to all the virtues, and besides he will do it\nwith pleasure and lavishly; excessive accuracy in calculation being\nMean. He will consider also how a thing may be done most beautifully\nand fittingly, rather, than for how much it may be done, and how at the\nleast expense.\nSo the Magnificent man must be also a liberal man, because the liberal\nman will also spend what he ought, and in right manner: but it is the\nGreat, that is to say tke large scale, which is distinctive of the\nMagnificent man, the object-matter of liberality being the same, and\nwithout spending more money than another man he will make the work more\nmagnificent. I mean, the excellence of a possession and of a work is\nnot the same: as a piece of property that thing is most valuable which\nis worth most, gold for instance; but as a work that which is great and\nbeautiful, because the contemplation of such an object is admirable,\nand so is that which is Magnificent. So the excellence of a work is\nMagnificence on a large scale. There are cases of expenditure which we\ncall honourable, such as are dedicatory offerings to the gods, and the\nfurnishing their temples, and sacrifices, and in like manner everything\nthat has reference to the Deity, and all such public matters as are\nobjects of honourable ambition, as when men think in any case that it\nis their duty to furnish a chorus for the stage splendidly, or fit out\nand maintain a trireme, or give a general public feast.\nNow in all these, as has been already stated, respect is had also to\nthe rank and the means of the man who is doing them: because they\nshould be proportionate to these, and befit not the work only but also\nthe doer of the work. For this reason a poor man cannot be a\nMagnificent man, since he has not means wherewith to spend largely and\nyet becomingly; and if he attempts it he is a fool, inasmuch as it is\nout of proportion and contrary to propriety, whereas to be in\naccordance with virtue a thing must be done rightly.\nSuch expenditure is fitting moreover for those to whom such things\npreviously belong, either through themselves or through their ancestors\nor people with whom they are connected, and to the high-born or people\nof high repute, and so on: because all these things imply greatness and\nreputation.\nSo then the Magnificent man is pretty much as I have described him, and\nMagnificence consists in such expenditures: because they are the\ngreatest and most honourable: and of private ones such as come but once\nfor all, marriage to wit, and things of that kind; and any occasion\nwhich engages the interest of the community in general, or of those who\nare in power; and what concerns receiving and despatching strangers;\nand gifts, and repaying gifts: because the Magnificent man is not apt\nto spend upon himself but on the public good, and gifts are pretty much\nin the same case as dedicatory offerings.\nIt is characteristic also of the Magnificent man to furnish his house\nsuitably to his wealth, for this also in a way reflects credit; and\nagain, to spend rather upon such works as are of long duration, these\nbeing most honourable. And again, propriety in each case, because the\nsame things are not suitable to gods and men, nor in a temple and a\ntomb. And again, in the case of expenditures, each must be great of its\nkind, and great expense on a great object is most magnificent, that is\nin any case what is great in these particular things.\nThere is a difference too between greatness of a work and greatness of\nexpenditure: for instance, a very beautiful ball or cup is magnificent\nas a present to a child, while the price of it is small and almost\nmean. Therefore it is characteristic of the Magnificent man to do\nmagnificently whatever he is about: for whatever is of this kind cannot\nbe easily surpassed, and bears a proper proportion to the expenditure.\nSuch then is the Magnificent man.\nThe man who is in the state of excess, called one of Vulgar Profusion,\nis in excess because he spends improperly, as has been said. I mean in\ncases requiring small expenditure he lavishes much and shows off out of\ntaste; giving his club a feast fit for a wedding-party, or if he has to\nfurnish a chorus for a comedy, giving the actors purple to wear in the\nfirst scene, as did the Megarians. And all such things he will do, not\nwith a view to that which is really honourable, but to display his\nwealth, and because he thinks he shall be admired for these things; and\nhe will spend little where he ought to spend much, and much where he\nshould spend little.\nThe Mean man will be deficient in every case, and even where he has\nspent the most he will spoil the whole effect for want of some trifle;\nhe is procrastinating in all he does, and contrives how he may spend\nthe least, and does even that with lamentations about the expense, and\nthinking that he does all things on a greater scale than he ought.\nOf course, both these states are faulty, but they do not involve\ndisgrace because they are neither hurtful to others nor very unseemly.\nChapter IV.\nThe very name of Great-mindedness implies, that great things are its\nobject-matter; and we will first settle what kind of things. It makes\nno difference, of course, whether we regard the moral state in the\nabstract or as exemplified in an individual.\nWell then, he is thought to be Great-minded who values himself highly\nand at the same time justly, because he that does so without grounds is\nfoolish, and no virtuous character is foolish or senseless. Well, the\ncharacter I have described is Great-minded. The man who estimates\nhimself lowly, and at the same time justly, is modest; but not\nGreat-minded, since this latter quality implies greatness, just as\nbeauty implies a large bodily conformation while small people are neat\nand well made but not beautiful.\nAgain, he who values himself highly without just grounds is a Vain man:\nthough the name must not be applied to every case of unduly high\nself-estimation. He that values himself below his real worth is\nSmall-minded, and whether that worth is great, moderate, or small, his\nown estimate falls below it. And he is the strongest case of this error\nwho is really a man of great worth, for what would he have done had his\nworth been less?\nThe Great-minded man is then, as far as greatness is concerned, at the\nsummit, but in respect of propriety he is in the mean, because he\nestimates himself at his real value (the other characters respectively\nare in excess and defect). Since then he justly estimates himself at a\nhigh, or rather at the highest possible rate, his character will have\nrespect specially to one thing: this term \u201crate\u201d has reference of\ncourse to external goods: and of these we should assume that to be the\ngreatest which we attribute to the gods, and which is the special\nobject of desire to those who are in power, and which is the prize\nproposed to the most honourable actions: now honour answers to these\ndescriptions, being the greatest of external goods. So the Great-minded\nman bears himself as he ought in respect of honour and dishonour. In\nfact, without need of words, the Great-minded plainly have honour for\ntheir object-matter: since honour is what the great consider themselves\nspecially worthy of, and according to a certain rate.\nThe Small-minded man is deficient, both as regards himself, and also as\nregards the estimation of the Great-minded: while the Vain man is in\nexcess as regards himself, but does not get beyond the Great-minded\nman. Now the Great-minded man, being by the hypothesis worthy of the\ngreatest things, must be of the highest excellence, since the better a\nman is the more is he worth, and he who is best is worth the most: it\nfollows then, that to be truly Great-minded a man must be good, and\nwhatever is great in each virtue would seem to belong to the\nGreat-minded. It would no way correspond with the character of the\nGreat-minded to flee spreading his hands all abroad; nor to injure any\none; for with what object in view will he do what is base, in whose\neyes nothing is great? in short, if one were to go into particulars,\nthe Great-minded man would show quite ludicrously unless he were a good\nman: he would not be in fact deserving of honour if he were a bad man,\nhonour being the prize of virtue and given to the good.\nThis virtue, then, of Great-mindedness seems to be a kind of ornament\nof all the other virtues, in that it makes them better and cannot be\nwithout them; and for this reason it is a hard matter to be really and\ntruly Great-minded; for it cannot be without thorough goodness and\nnobleness of character.\nHonour then and dishonour are specially the object-matter of the\nGreat-minded man: and at such as is great, and given by good men, he\nwill be pleased moderately as getting his own, or perhaps somewhat less\nfor no honour can be quite adequate to perfect virtue: but still he\nwill accept this because they have nothing higher to give him. But such\nas is given by ordinary people and on trifling grounds he will entirely\ndespise, because these do not come up to his deserts: and dishonour\nlikewise, because in his case there cannot be just ground for it.\nNow though, as I have said, honour is specially the object-matter of\nthe Great-minded man, I do not mean but that likewise in respect of\nwealth and power, and good or bad fortune of every kind, he will bear\nhimself with moderation, fall out how they may, and neither in\nprosperity will he be overjoyed nor in adversity will he be unduly\npained. For not even in respect of honour does he so bear himself; and\nyet it is the greatest of all such objects, since it is the cause of\npower and wealth being choice-worthy, for certainly they who have them\ndesire to receive honour through them. So to whom honour even is a\nsmall thing to him will all other things also be so; and this is why\nsuch men are thought to be supercilious.\nIt seems too that pieces of good fortune contribute to form this\ncharacter of Great-mindedness: I mean, the nobly born, or men of\ninfluence, or the wealthy, are considered to be entitled to honour, for\nthey are in a position of eminence and whatever is eminent by good is\nmore entitled to honour: and this is why such circumstances dispose men\nrather to Great-mindedness, because they receive honour at the hands of\nsome men.\nNow really and truly the good man alone is entitled to honour; only if\na man unites in himself goodness with these external advantages he is\nthought to be more entitled to honour: but they who have them without\nalso having virtue are not justified in their high estimate of\nthemselves, nor are they rightly denominated Great-minded; since\nperfect virtue is one of the indispensable conditions to such &\ncharacter.\nFurther, such men become supercilious and insolent, it not being easy\nto bear prosperity well without goodness; and not being able to bear\nit, and possessed with an idea of their own superiority to others, they\ndespise them, and do just whatever their fancy prompts; for they mimic\nthe Great-minded man, though they are not like him, and they do this in\nsuch points as they can, so without doing the actions which can only\nflow from real goodness they despise others. Whereas the Great-minded\nman despises on good grounds (for he forms his opinions truly), but the\nmass of men do it at random.\nMoreover, he is not a man to incur little risks, nor does he court\ndanger, because there are but few things he has a value for; but he\nwill incur great dangers, and when he does venture he is prodigal of\nhis life as knowing that there are terms on which it is not worth his\nwhile to live. He is the sort of man to do kindnesses, but he is\nashamed to receive them; the former putting a man in the position of\nsuperiority, the latter in that of inferiority; accordingly he will\ngreatly overpay any kindness done to him, because the original actor\nwill thus be laid under obligation and be in the position of the party\nbenefited. Such men seem likewise to remember those they have done\nkindnesses to, but not those from whom they have received them: because\nhe who has received is inferior to him who has done the kindness and\nour friend wishes to be superior; accordingly he is pleased to hear of\nhis own kind acts but not of those done to himself (and this is why, in\nHomer, Thetis does not mention to Jupiter the kindnesses she had done\nhim, nor did the Laced\u00e6monians to the Athenians but only the benefits\nthey had received).\nFurther, it is characteristic of the Great-minded man to ask favours\nnot at all, or very reluctantly, but to do a service very readily; and\nto bear himself loftily towards the great or fortunate, but towards\npeople of middle station affably; because to be above the former is\ndifficult and so a grand thing, but to be above the latter is easy; and\nto be high and mighty towards the former is not ignoble, but to do it\ntowards those of humble station would be low and vulgar; it would be\nlike parading strength against the weak.\nAnd again, not to put himself in the way of honour, nor to go where\nothers are the chief men; and to be remiss and dilatory, except in the\ncase of some great honour or work; and to be concerned in few things,\nand those great and famous. It is a property of him also to be open,\nboth in his dislikes and his likings, because concealment is a\nconsequent of fear. Likewise to be careful for reality rather than\nappearance, and talk and act openly (for his contempt for others makes\nhim a bold man, for which same reason he is apt to speak the truth,\nexcept where the principle of reserve comes in), but to be reserved\ntowards the generality of men.\nAnd to be unable to live with reference to any other but a friend;\nbecause doing so is servile, as may be seen in that all flatterers are\nlow and men in low estate are flatterers. Neither is his admiration\neasily excited, because nothing is great in his eyes; nor does he bear\nmalice, since remembering anything, and specially wrongs, is no part of\nGreat-mindedness, but rather overlooking them; nor does he talk of\nother men; in fact, he will not speak either of himself or of any\nother; he neither cares to be praised himself nor to have others\nblamed; nor again does he praise freely, and for this reason he is not\napt to speak ill even of his enemies except to show contempt and\ninsolence.\nAnd he is by no means apt to make laments about things which cannot be\nhelped, or requests about those which are trivial; because to be thus\ndisposed with respect to these things is consequent only upon real\nanxiety about them. Again, he is the kind of man to acquire what is\nbeautiful and unproductive rather than what is productive and\nprofitable: this being rather the part of an independent man.\nAlso slow motion, deep-toned voice, and deliberate style of speech, are\nthought to be characteristic of the Great-minded man: for he who is\nearnest about few things is not likely to be in a hurry, nor he who\nesteems nothing great to be very intent: and sharp tones and quickness\nare the result of these.\nChapter V.\nThis then is my idea of the Great-minded man; and he who is in the\ndefect is a Small-minded man, he who is in the excess a Vain man.\nHowever, as we observed in respect of the last character we discussed,\nthese extremes are not thought to be vicious exactly, but only\nmistaken, for they do no harm.\nThe Small-minded man, for instance, being really worthy of good\ndeprives himself of his deserts, and seems to have somewhat faulty from\nnot having a sufficiently high estimate of his own desert, in fact from\nself-ignorance: because, but for this, he would have grasped after what\nhe really is entitled to, and that is good. Still such characters are\nnot thought to be foolish, but rather laggards. But the having such an\nopinion of themselves seems to have a deteriorating effect on the\ncharacter: because in all cases men\u2019s aims are regulated by their\nsupposed desert, and thus these men, under a notion of their own want\nof desert, stand aloof from honourable actions and courses, and\nsimilarly from external goods.\nBut the Vain are foolish and self-ignorant, and that palpably: because\nthey attempt honourable things, as though they were worthy, and then\nthey are detected. They also set themselves off, by dress, and\ncarriage, and such-like things, and desire that their good\ncircumstances may be seen, and they talk of them under the notion of\nreceiving honour thereby. Small-mindedness rather than Vanity is\nopposed to Great-mindedness, because it is more commonly met with and\nis worse.\nChapter VI.\nWell, the virtue of Great-mindedness has for its object great Honour,\nas we have said: and there seems to be a virtue having Honour also for\nits object (as we stated in the former book), which may seem to bear to\nGreat-mindedness the same relation that Liberality does to\nMagnificence: that is, both these virtues stand aloof from what is\ngreat but dispose us as we ought to be disposed towards moderate and\nsmall matters. Further: as in giving and receiving of wealth there is a\nmean state, an excess, and a defect, so likewise in grasping after\nHonour there is the more or less than is right, and also the doing so\nfrom right sources and in right manner.\nFor we blame the lover of Honour as aiming at Honour more than he\nought, and from wrong sources; and him who is destitute of a love of\nHonour as not choosing to be honoured even for what is noble. Sometimes\nagain we praise the lover of Honour as manly and having a love for what\nis noble, and him who has no love for it as being moderate and modest\n(as we noticed also in the former discussion of these virtues).\nIt is clear then that since \u201cLover of so and so\u201d is a term capable of\nseveral meanings, we do not always denote the same quality by the term\n\u201cLover of Honour;\u201d but when we use it as a term of commendation we\ndenote more than the mass of men are; when for blame more than a man\nshould be.\nAnd the mean state having no proper name the extremes seem to dispute\nfor it as unoccupied ground: but of course where there is excess and\ndefect there must be also the mean. And in point of fact, men do grasp\nat Honour more than they should, and less, and sometimes just as they\nought; for instance, this state is praised, being a mean state in\nregard of Honour, but without any appropriate name. Compared with what\nis called Ambition it shows like a want of love for Honour, and\ncompared with this it shows like Ambition, or compared with both, like\nboth faults: nor is this a singular case among the virtues. Here the\nextreme characters appear to be opposed, because the mean has no name\nappropriated to it.\nChapter VII.\nMeekness is a mean state, having for its object-matter Anger: and as\nthe character in the mean has no name, and we may almost say the same\nof the extremes, we give the name of Meekness (leaning rather to the\ndefect, which has no name either) to the character in the mean.\nThe excess may be called an over-aptness to Anger: for the passion is\nAnger, and the producing causes many and various. Now he who is angry\nat what and with whom he ought, and further, in right manner and time,\nand for proper length of time, is praised, so this Man will be Meek\nsince Meekness is praised. For the notion represented by the term Meek\nman is the being imperturbable, and not being led away by passion, but\nbeing angry in that manner, and at those things, and for that length of\ntime, which Reason may direct. This character however is thought to err\nrather on the side of defect, inasmuch as he is not apt to take revenge\nbut rather to make allowances and forgive. And the defect, call it\nAngerlessness or what you will, is blamed: I mean, they who are not\nangry at things at which they ought to be angry are thought to be\nfoolish, and they who are angry not in right manner, nor in right time,\nnor with those with whom they ought; for a man who labours under this\ndefect is thought to have no perception, nor to be pained, and to have\nno tendency to avenge himself, inasmuch as he feels no anger: now to\nbear with scurrility in one\u2019s own person, and patiently see one\u2019s own\nfriends suffer it, is a slavish thing.\nAs for the excess, it occurs in all forms; men are angry with those\nwith whom, and at things with which, they ought not to be, and more\nthan they ought, and too hastily, and for too great a length of time. I\ndo not mean, however, that these are combined in any one person: that\nwould in fact be impossible, because the evil destroys itself, and if\nit is developed in its full force it becomes unbearable.\nNow those whom we term the Passionate are soon angry, and with people\nwith whom and at things at which they ought not, and in an excessive\ndegree, but they soon cool again, which is the best point about them.\nAnd this results from their not repressing their anger, but repaying\ntheir enemies (in that they show their feeings by reason of their\nvehemence), and then they have done with it.\nThe Choleric again are excessively vehement, and are angry at\neverything, and on every occasion; whence comes their Greek name\nsignifying that their choler lies high.\nThe Bitter-tempered are hard to reconcile and keep their anger for a\nlong while, because they repress the feeling: but when they have\nrevenged themselves then comes a lull; for the vengeance destroys their\nanger by producing pleasure in lieu of pain. But if this does not\nhappen they keep the weight on their minds: because, as it does not\nshow itself, no one attempts to reason it away, and digesting anger\nwithin one\u2019s self takes time. Such men are very great nuisances to\nthemselves and to their best friends.\nAgain, we call those Cross-grained who are angry at wrong objects, and\nin excessive degree, and for too long a time, and who are not appeased\nwithout vengeance or at least punishing the offender.\nTo Meekness we oppose the excess rather than the defect, because it is\nof more common occurrence: for human nature is more disposed to take\nthan to forgo revenge. And the Cross-grained are worse to live with\n[than they who are too phlegmatic].\nNow, from what has been here said, that is also plain which was said\nbefore. I mean, it is no easy matter to define how, and with what\npersons, and at what kind of things, and how long one ought to be\nangry, and up to what point a person is right or is wrong. For he that\ntransgresses the strict rule only a little, whether on the side of too\nmuch or too little, is not blamed: sometimes we praise those who are\ndeficient in the feeling and call them Meek, sometimes we call the\nirritable Spirited as being well qualified for government. So it is not\neasy to lay down, in so many words, for what degree or kind of\ntransgression a man is blameable: because the decision is in\nparticulars, and rests therefore with the Moral Sense. Thus much,\nhowever, is plain, that the mean state is praiseworthy, in virtue of\nwhich we are angry with those with whom, and at those things with\nwhich, we ought to be angry, and in right manner, and so on; while the\nexcesses and defects are blameable, slightly so if only slight, more so\nif greater, and when considerable very blameable.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the mean state is what we are to hold to.\nThis then is to be taken as our account of the various moral states\nwhich have Anger for their object-matter.\nChapter VIII.\nNext, as regards social intercourse and interchange of words and acts,\nsome men are thought to be Over-Complaisant who, with a view solely to\ngiving pleasure, agree to everything and never oppose, but think their\nline is to give no pain to those they are thrown amongst: they, on the\nother hand, are called Cross and Contentious who take exactly the\ncontrary line to these, and oppose in everything, and have no care at\nall whether they give pain or not.\nNow it is quite clear of course, that the states I have named are\nblameable, and that the mean between them is praiseworthy, in virtue of\nwhich a man will let pass what he ought as he ought, and also will\nobject in like manner. However, this state has no name appropriated,\nbut it is most like Friendship; since the man who exhibits it is just\nthe kind of man whom we would call the amiable friend, with the\naddition of strong earnest affection; but then this is the very point\nin which it differs from Friendship, that it is quite independent of\nany feeling or strong affection for those among whom the man mixes: I\nmean, that he takes everything as he ought, not from any feeling of\nlove or hatred, but simply because his natural disposition leads him to\ndo so; he will do it alike to those whom he does know and those whom he\ndoes not, and those with whom he is intimate and those with whom he is\nnot; only in each case as propriety requires, because it is not fitting\nto care alike for intimates and strangers, nor again to pain them\nalike.\nIt has been stated in a general way that his social intercourse will be\nregulated by propriety, and his aim will be to avoid giving pain and to\ncontribute to pleasure, but with a constant reference to what is noble\nand expedient.\nHis proper object-matter seems to be the pleasures and pains which\narise out of social intercourse, but whenever it is not honourable or\neven hurtful to him to contribute to pleasure, in these instances he\nwill run counter and prefer to give pain.\nOr if the things in question involve unseemliness to the doer, and this\nnot inconsiderable, or any harm, whereas his opposition will cause some\nlittle pain, here he will not agree but will run counter.\nAgain, he will regulate differently his intercourse with great men and\nwith ordinary men, and with all people according to the knowledge he\nhas of them; and in like manner, taking in any other differences which\nmay exist, giving to each his due, and in itself preferring to give\npleasure and cautious not to give pain, but still guided by the\nresults, I mean by what is noble and expedient according as they\npreponderate.\nAgain, he will inflict trifling pain with a view to consequent\npleasure.\nWell, the man bearing the mean character is pretty well such as I have\ndescribed him, but he has no name appropriated to him: of those who try\nto give pleasure, the man who simply and disinterestedly tries to be\nagreeable is called Over-Complaisant, he who does it with a view to\nsecure some profit in the way of wealth, or those things which wealth\nmay procure, is a Flatterer: I have said before, that the man who is\n\u201calways non-content\u201d is Cross and Contentious. Here the extremes have\nthe appearance of being opposed to one another, because the mean has no\nappropriate name.\nChapter IX.\nThe mean state which steers clear of Exaggeration has pretty much the\nsame object-matter as the last we described, and likewise has no name\nappropriated to it. Still it may be as well to go over these states:\nbecause, in the first place, by a particular discussion of each we\nshall be better acquainted with the general subject of moral character,\nand next we shall be the more convinced that the virtues are mean\nstates by seeing that this is universally the case.\nIn respect then of living in society, those who carry on this\nintercourse with a view to pleasure and pain have been already spoken\nof; we will now go on to speak of those who are True or False, alike in\ntheir words and deeds and in the claims which they advance.\nNow the Exaggerator is thought to have a tendency to lay claim to\nthings reflecting credit on him, both when they do not belong to him at\nall and also in greater degree than that in which they really do:\nwhereas the Reserved man, on the contrary, denies those which really\nbelong to him or else depreciates them, while the mean character being\na Plain-matter-of-fact person is Truthful in life and word, admitting\nthe existence of what does really belong to him and making it neither\ngreater nor less than the truth.\nIt is possible of course to take any of these lines either with or\nwithout some further view: but in general men speak, and act, and live,\neach according to his particular character and disposition, unless\nindeed a man is acting from any special motive.\nNow since falsehood is in itself low and blameable, while truth is\nnoble and praiseworthy, it follows that the Truthful man (who is also\nin the mean) is praiseworthy, and the two who depart from strict truth\nare both blameable, but especially the Exaggerator.\nWe will now speak of each, and first of the Truthful man: I call him\nTruthful, because we are not now meaning the man who is true in his\nagreements nor in such matters as amount to justice or injustice (this\nwould come within the province of a different virtue), but, in such as\ndo not involve any such serious difference as this, the man we are\ndescribing is true in life and word simply because he is in a certain\nmoral state.\nAnd he that is such must be judged to be a good man: for he that has a\nlove for Truth as such, and is guided by it in matters indifferent,\nwill be so likewise even more in such as are not indifferent; for\nsurely he will have a dread of falsehood as base, since he shunned it\neven in itself: and he that is of such a character is praiseworthy, yet\nhe leans rather to that which is below the truth, this having an\nappearance of being in better taste because exaggerations are so\nhateful.\nAs for the man who lays claim to things above what really belongs to\nhim _without_ any special motive, he is like a base man because he\nwould not otherwise have taken pleasure in falsehood, but he shows as a\nfool rather than as a knave. But if a man does this _with_ a special\nmotive, suppose for honour or glory, as the Braggart does, then he is\nnot so very blameworthy, but if, directly or indirectly, for pecuniary\nconsiderations, he is more unseemly.\nNow the Braggart is such not by his power but by his purpose, that is\nto say, in virtue of his moral state, and because he is a man of a\ncertain kind; just as there are liars who take pleasure in falsehood\nfor its own sake while others lie from a desire of glory or gain. They\nwho exaggerate with a view to glory pretend to such qualities as are\nfollowed by praise or highest congratulation; they who do it with a\nview to gain assume those which their neighbours can avail themselves\nof, and the absence of which can be concealed, as a man\u2019s being a\nskilful soothsayer or physician; and accordingly most men pretend to\nsuch things and exaggerate in this direction, because the faults I have\nmentioned are in them.\nThe Reserved, who depreciate their own qualities, have the appearance\nof being more refined in their characters, because they are not thought\nto speak with a view to gain but to avoid grandeur: one very common\ntrait in such characters is their denying common current opinions, as\nSocrates used to do. There are people who lay claim falsely to small\nthings and things the falsity of their pretensions to which is obvious;\nthese are called Factotums and are very despicable.\nThis very Reserve sometimes shows like Exaggeration; take, for\ninstance, the excessive plainness of dress affected by the\nLaced\u00e6monians: in fact, both excess and the extreme of deficiency\npartake of the nature of Exaggeration. But they who practise Reserve in\nmoderation, and in cases in which the truth is not very obvious and\nplain, give an impression of refinement. Here it is the Exaggerator (as\nbeing the worst character) who appears to be opposed to the Truthful\nMan.\nChapter X.\nNext, as life has its pauses and in them admits of pastime combined\nwith Jocularity, it is thought that in this respect also there is a\nkind of fitting intercourse, and that rules may be prescribed as to the\nkind of things one should say and the manner of saying them; and in\nrespect of hearing likewise (and there will be a difference between the\nsaying and hearing such and such things). It is plain that in regard to\nthese things also there will be an excess and defect and a mean.\nNow they who exceed in the ridiculous are judged to be Buffoons and\nVulgar, catching at it in any and every way and at any cost, and aiming\nrather at raising laughter than at saying what is seemly and at\navoiding to pain the object of their wit. They, on the other hand, who\nwould not for the world make a joke themselves and are displeased with\nsuch as do are thought to be Clownish and Stern. But they who are\nJocular in good taste are denominated by a Greek term expressing\nproperly ease of movement, because such are thought to be, as one may\nsay, motions of the moral character; and as bodies are judged of by\ntheir motions so too are moral characters.\nNow as the ridiculous lies on the surface, and the majority of men take\nmore pleasure than they ought in Jocularity and Jesting, the Buffoons\ntoo get this name of Easy Pleasantry, as if refined and gentlemanlike;\nbut that they differ from these, and considerably too, is plain from\nwhat has been said.\nOne quality which belongs to the mean state is Tact: it is\ncharacteristic of a man of Tact to say and listen to such things as are\nfit for a good man and a gentleman to say and listen to: for there are\nthings which are becoming for such a one to say and listen to in the\nway of Jocularity, and there is a difference between the Jocularity of\nthe Gentleman and that of the Vulgarian; and again, between that of the\neducated and uneducated man. This you may see from a comparison of the\nOld and New Comedy: in the former obscene talk made the fun; in the\nlatter it is rather innuendo: and this is no slight difference _as\nregards decency_.\nWell then, are we to characterise him who jests well by his saying what\nis becoming a gentleman, or by his avoiding to pain the object of his\nwit, or even by his giving him pleasure? or will not such a definition\nbe vague, since different things are hateful and pleasant to different\nmen?\nBe this as it may, whatever he says such things will he also listen to,\nsince it is commonly held that a man will do what he will bear to hear:\nthis must, however, be limited; a man will not do quite all that he\nwill hear: because jesting is a species of scurrility and there are\nsome points of scurrility forbidden by law; it may be certain points of\njesting should have been also so forbidden. So then the refined and\ngentlemanlike man will bear himself thus as being a law to himself.\nSuch is the mean character, whether denominated the man of Tact or of\nEasy Pleasantry.\nBut the Buffoon cannot resist the ridiculous, sparing neither himself\nnor any one else so that he can but raise his laugh, saying things of\nsuch kind as no man of refinement would say and some which he would not\neven tolerate if said by others in his hearing.\nThe Clownish man is for such intercourse wholly useless: inasmuch as\ncontributing nothing jocose of his own he is savage with all who do.\nYet some pause and amusement in life are generally judged to be\nindispensable.\nThe three mean states which have been described do occur in life, and\nthe object-matter of all is interchange of words and deeds. They\ndiffer, in that one of them is concerned with truth, and the other two\nwith the pleasurable: and of these two again, the one is conversant\nwith the jocosities of life, the other with all other points of social\nintercourse.\nChapter XI.\nTo speak of Shame as a Virtue is incorrect, because it is much more\nlike a feeling than a moral state. It is defined, we know, to be \u201ca\nkind of fear of disgrace,\u201d and its effects are similar to those of the\nfear of danger, for they who feel Shame grow red and they who fear\ndeath turn pale. So both are evidently in a way physical, which is\nthought to be a mark of a feeling rather than a moral state.\nMoreover, it is a feeling not suitable to every age, but only to youth:\nwe do think that the young should be Shamefaced, because since they\nlive at the beck and call of passion they do much that is wrong and\nShame acts on them as a check. In fact, we praise such young men as are\nShamefaced, but no one would ever praise an old man for being given to\nit, inasmuch as we hold that he ought not to do things which cause\nShame; for Shame, since it arises at low bad actions, does not at all\nbelong to the good man, because such ought not to be done at all: nor\ndoes it make any difference to allege that some things are disgraceful\nreally, others only because they are thought so; for neither should be\ndone, so that a man ought not to be in the position of feeling Shame.\nIn truth, to be such a man as to do anything disgraceful is the part of\na faulty character. And for a man to be such that he would feel Shame\nif he should do anything disgraceful, and to think that this\nconstitutes him a good man, is absurd: because Shame is felt at\nvoluntary actions only, and a good man will never voluntarily do what\nis base.\nTrue it is, that Shame may be good on a certain supposition, as \u201cif a\nman should do such things, he would feel Shame:\u201d but then the Virtues\nare good in themselves, and not merely in supposed cases. And, granted\nthat impudence and the not being ashamed to do what is disgraceful is\nbase, it does not the more follow that it is good for a man to do such\nthings and feel Shame.\nNor is Self-Control properly a Virtue, but a kind of mixed state:\nhowever, all about this shall be set forth in a future Book.\nBOOK V\nChapter I.\nNow the points for our enquiry in respect of Justice and Injustice are,\nwhat kind of actions are their object-matter, and what kind of a mean\nstate Justice is, and between what points the abstract principle of it,\ni.e. the Just, is a mean. And our enquiry shall be, if you please,\nconducted in the same method as we have observed in the foregoing parts\nof this Treatise.\nWe see then that all men mean by the term Justice a moral state such\nthat in consequence of it men have the capacity of doing what is just,\nand actually do it, and wish it:[1] similarly also with respect to\nInjustice, a moral state such that in consequence of it men do unjustly\nand wish what is unjust: let us also be content then with these as a\nground-work sketched out.\nI mention the two, because the same does not hold with regard to States\nwhether of mind or body as with regard to Sciences or Faculties: I mean\nthat whereas it is thought that the same Faculty or Science embraces\ncontraries, a State will not: from health, for instance, not the\ncontrary acts are done but the healthy ones only; we say a man walks\nhealthily when he walks as the healthy man would.\nHowever, of the two contrary states the one may be frequently known\nfrom the other, and oftentimes the states from their subject-matter: if\nit be seen clearly what a good state of body is, then is it also seen\nwhat a bad state is, and from the things which belong to a good state\nof body the good state itself is seen, and _vice vers\u00e2_. If, for\ninstance, the good state is firmness of flesh it follows that the bad\nstate is flabbiness of flesh; and whatever causes firmness of flesh is\nconnected with the good state.\nIt follows moreover in general,[2] that if of two contrary terms the\none is used in many senses so also will the other be; as, for instance,\nif \u201cthe Just,\u201d then also \u201cthe Unjust.\u201d Now Justice and Injustice do\nseem to be used respectively in many senses, but, because the line of\ndemarcation between these is very fine and minute,[3] it commonly\nescapes notice that they are thus used, and it is not plain and\nmanifest as where the various significations of terms are widely\ndifferent for in these last the visible difference is great, for\ninstance, the word \u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 is used equivocally to denote the bone which\nis under the neck of animals and the instrument with which people close\ndoors.\nLet it be ascertained then in how many senses the term \u201cUnjust man\u201d is\nused. Well, he who violates the law, and he who is a grasping man, and\nthe unequal man, are all thought to be Unjust and so manifestly the\nJust man will be, the man who acts according to law, and the equal man\n\u201cThe Just\u201d then will be the lawful and the equal, and \u201cthe Unjust\u201d the\nunlawful and the unequal.\nWell, since the Unjust man is also a grasping man, he will be so, of\ncourse, with respect to good things, but not of every kind, only those\nwhich are the subject-matter of good and bad fortune and which are in\nthemselves always good but not always to the individual.[4] Yet men\npray for and pursue these things: this they should not do but pray that\nthings which are in the abstract good may be so also to them, and\nchoose what is good for themselves.\nBut the Unjust man does not always choose actually the greater part,\nbut even sometimes the less; as in the case of things which are simply\nevil: still, since the less evil is thought to be in a manner a good\nand the grasping is after good, therefore even in this case he is\nthought to be a grasping man, _i.e._ one who strives for more good than\nfairly falls to his share: of course he is also an unequal man, this\nbeing an inclusive and common term.\nChapter II.\nWe said that the violator of Law is Unjust, and the keeper of the Law\nJust: further, it is plain that all Lawful things are in a manner Just,\nbecause by Lawful we understand what have been defined by the\nlegislative power and each of these we say is Just. The Laws too give\ndirections on all points, aiming either at the common good of all, or\nthat of the best, or that of those in power (taking for the standard\nreal goodness or adopting some other estimate); in one way we mean by\nJust, those things which are apt to produce and preserve happiness and\nits ingredients for the social community.\nFurther, the Law commands the doing the deeds not only of the brave man\n(as not leaving the ranks, nor flying, nor throwing away one\u2019s arms),\nbut those also of the perfectly self-mastering man, as abstinence from\nadultery and wantonness; and those of the meek man, as refraining from\nstriking others or using abusive language: and in like manner in\nrespect of the other virtues and vices commanding some things and\nforbidding others, rightly if it is a good law, in a way somewhat\ninferior if it is one extemporised.\nNow this Justice is in fact perfect Virtue, yet not simply so but as\nexercised towards one\u2019s neighbour: and for this reason Justice is\nthought oftentimes to be the best of the Virtues, and\n\u201cneither Hesper nor the Morning-star\nSo worthy of our admiration:\u201d\nand in a proverbial saying we express the same;\n\u201cAll virtue is in Justice comprehended.\u201d\nAnd it is in a special sense perfect Virtue because it is the practice\nof perfect Virtue. And perfect it is because he that has it is able to\npractise his virtue towards his neighbour and not merely on himself; I\nmean, there are many who can practise virtue in the regulation of their\nown personal conduct who are wholly unable to do it in transactions\nwith their neighbour. And for this reason that saying of Bias is\nthought to be a good one,\n\u201cRule will show what a man is;\u201d\nfor he who bears Rule is necessarily in contact with others, i.e. in a\ncommunity. And for this same reason Justice alone of all the Virtues is\nthought to be a good to others, because it has immediate relation to\nsome other person, inasmuch as the Just man does what is advantageous\nto another, either to his ruler or fellow-subject. Now he is the basest\nof men who practises vice not only in his own person,[5] but towards\nhis friends also; but he the best who practises virtue not merely in\nhis own person but towards his neighbour, for this is a matter of some\ndifficulty.\nHowever, Justice in this sense is not a part of Virtue but is\nco-extensive with Virtue; nor is the Injustice which answers to it a\npart of Vice but co-extensive with Vice. Now wherein Justice in this\nsense differs from Virtue appears from what has been said: it is the\nsame really, but the point of view is not the same: in so far as it has\nrespect to one\u2019s neighbour it is Justice, in so far as it is such and\nsuch a moral state it is simply Virtue.\nChapter III.\nBut the object of our enquiry is Justice, in the sense in which it is a\npart of Virtue (for there is such a thing, as we commonly say), and\nlikewise with respect to particular Injustice. And of the existence of\nthis last the following consideration is a proof: there are many vices\nby practising which a man acts unjustly, of course, but does not grasp\nat more than his share of good; if, for instance, by reason of\ncowardice he throws away his shield, or by reason of ill-temper he uses\nabusive language, or by reason of stinginess does not give a friend\npecuniary assistance; but whenever he does a grasping action, it is\noften in the way of none of these vices, certainly not in all of them,\nstill in the way of some vice or other (for we blame him), and in the\nway of Injustice. There is then some kind of Injustice distinct from\nthat co-extensive with Vice and related to it as a part to a whole, and\nsome \u201cUnjust\u201d related to that which is co-extensive with violation of\nthe law as a part to a whole.\nAgain, suppose one man seduces a man\u2019s wife with a view to gain and\nactually gets some advantage by it,[6] and another does the same from\nimpulse of lust, at an expense of money and damage; this latter will be\nthought to be rather destitute of self-mastery than a grasping man, and\nthe former Unjust but not destitute of self-mastery: now why? plainly\nbecause of his gaining.\nAgain, all other acts of Injustice we refer to some particular\ndepravity, as, if a man commits adultery, to abandonment to his\npassions; if he deserts his comrade, to cowardice; if he strikes\nanother, to anger: but if he gains by the act to no other vice than to\nInjustice.\nThus it is clear that there is a kind of Injustice different from and\nbesides that which includes all Vice, having the same name because the\ndefinition is in the same genus; for both have their force in dealings\nwith others, but the one acts upon honour, or wealth, or safety, or by\nwhatever one name we can include all these things, and is actuated by\npleasure attendant on gain, while the other acts upon all things which\nconstitute the sphere of the good man\u2019s action.\nChapter IV.\nNow that there is more than one kind of Justice, and that there is one\nwhich is distinct from and besides that which is co-extensive with,\nVirtue, is plain: we must next ascertain what it is, and what are its\ncharacteristics.\nWell, the Unjust has been divided into the unlawful and the unequal,\nand the Just accordingly into the lawful and the equal: the\naforementioned Injustice is in the way of the unlawful. And as the\nunequal and the more[7] are not the same, but differing as part to\nwhole (because all more is unequal, but not all unequal more), so the\nUnjust and the Injustice we are now in search of are not the same with,\nbut other than, those before mentioned, the one being the parts, the\nother the wholes; for this particular Injustice is a part of the\nInjustice co-extensive with Vice, and likewise this Justice of the\nJustice co-extensive with Virtue. So that what we have now to speak of\nis the particular Justice and Injustice, and likewise the particular\nJust and Unjust.\nHere then let us dismiss any further consideration of the Justice\nranking as co-extensive with Virtue (being the practice of Virtue in\nall its bearings towards others), and of the co-relative Injustice\n(being similarly the practice of Vice). It is clear too, that we must\nseparate off the Just and the Unjust involved in these: because one may\npretty well say that most lawful things are those which naturally\nresult in action from Virtue in its fullest sense, because the law\nenjoins the living in accordance with each Virtue and forbids living in\naccordance with each Vice. And the producing causes of Virtue in all\nits bearings are those enactments which have been made respecting\neducation for society.\nBy the way, as to individual education, in respect of which a man is\nsimply good without reference to others, whether it is the province of\n\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 or some other science we must determine at a future time: for\nit may be it is not the same thing to be a good man and a good citizen\nin every case.[8]\nChapter V.\nNow of the Particular Justice, and the Just involved in it, one species\nis that which is concerned in the distributions of honour, or wealth,\nor such other things as are to be shared among the members of the\nsocial community (because in these one man as compared with another may\nhave either an equal or an unequal share), and the other is that which\nis Corrective in the various transactions between man and man.\nAnd of this latter there are two parts: because of transactions some\nare voluntary and some involuntary; voluntary, such as follow; selling,\nbuying, use, bail, borrowing, deposit, hiring: and this class is called\nvoluntary because the origination of these transactions is voluntary.\nThe involuntary again are either such as effect secrecy; as theft,\nadultery, poisoning, pimping, kidnapping of slaves, assassination,\nfalse witness; or accompanied with open violence; as insult, bonds,\ndeath, plundering, maiming, foul language, slanderous abuse.\nChapter VI.\nWell, the unjust man we have said is unequal, and the abstract \u201cUnjust\u201d\nunequal: further, it is plain that there is some mean of the unequal,\nthat is to say, the equal or exact half (because in whatever action\nthere is the greater and the less there is also the equal, i.e. the\nexact half). If then the Unjust is unequal the Just is equal, which all\nmust allow without further proof: and as the equal is a mean the Just\nmust be also a mean. Now the equal implies two terms at least: it\nfollows then that the Just is both a mean and equal, and these to\ncertain persons; and, in so far as it is a mean, between certain things\n(that is, the greater and the less), and, so far as it is equal,\nbetween two, and in so far as it is just it is so to certain persons.\nThe Just then must imply four terms at least, for those[9]  to which it\nis just are two, and the terms representing the things are two.\nAnd there will be the same equality between the terms representing the\npersons, as between those representing the things: because as the\nlatter are to one another so are the former: for if the persons are not\nequal they must not have equal shares; in fact this is the very source\nof all the quarrelling and wrangling in the world, when either they who\nare equal have and get awarded to them things not equal, or being not\nequal those things which are equal. Again, the necessity of this\nequality of ratios is shown by the common phrase \u201caccording to rate,\u201d\nfor all agree that the Just in distributions ought to be according to\nsome rate: but what that rate is to be, all do not agree; the democrats\nare for freedom, oligarchs for wealth, others for nobleness of birth,\nand the aristocratic party for virtue.\nThe Just, then, is a certain proportionable thing. For proportion does\nnot apply merely to number in the abstract,[10] but to number\ngenerally, since it is equality of ratios, and implies four terms at\nleast (that this is the case in what may be called discrete proportion\nis plain and obvious, but it is true also in continual proportion, for\nthis uses the one term as two, and mentions it twice; thus A:B:C may be\nexpressed A:B::B:C. In the first, B is named twice; and so, if, as in\nthe second, B is actually written twice, the proportionals will be\nfour): and the Just likewise implies four terms at the least, and the\nratio between the two pair of terms is the same, because the persons\nand the things are divided similarly. It will stand then thus,\nA:B::C:D, and then permutando A:C::B:D, and then (supposing C and D to\nrepresent the things) A+C:B+D::A:B. The distribution in fact consisting\nin putting together these terms thus: and if they are put together so\nas to preserve this same ratio, the distribution puts them together\njustly.[11] So then the joining together of the first and third and\nsecond and fourth proportionals is the Just in the distribution, and\nthis Just is the mean relatively to that which violates the\nproportionate, for the proportionate is a mean and the Just is\nproportionate. Now mathematicians call this kind of proportion\ngeometrical: for in geometrical proportion the whole is to the whole as\neach part to each part. Furthermore this proportion is not continual,\nbecause the person and thing do not make up one term.\nThe Just then is this proportionate, and the Unjust that which violates\nthe proportionate; and so there comes to be the greater and the less:\nwhich in fact is the case in actual transactions, because he who acts\nunjustly has the greater share and he who is treated unjustly has the\nless of what is good: but in the case of what is bad this is reversed:\nfor the less evil compared with the greater comes to be reckoned for\ngood, because the less evil is more choice-worthy than the greater, and\nwhat is choice-worthy is good, and the more so the greater good.\nThis then is the one species of the Just.\nChapter VII.\nAnd the remaining one is the Corrective, which arises in voluntary as\nwell as involuntary transactions. Now this just has a different form\nfrom the aforementioned; for that which is concerned in distribution of\ncommon property is always according to the aforementioned proportion: I\nmean that, if the division is made out of common property, the shares\nwill bear the same proportion to one another as the original\ncontributions did: and the Unjust which is opposite to this Just is\nthat which violates the proportionate.\nBut the Just which arises in transactions between men is an equal in a\ncertain sense, and the Unjust an unequal, only not in the way of that\nproportion but of arithmetical.[12] Because it makes no difference\nwhether a robbery, for instance, is committed by a good man on a bad or\nby a bad man on a good, nor whether a good or a bad man has committed\nadultery: the law looks only to the difference created by the injury\nand treats the men as previously equal, where the one does and the\nother suffers injury, or the one has done and the other suffered harm.\nAnd so this Unjust, being unequal, the judge endeavours to reduce to\nequality again, because really when the one party has been wounded and\nthe other has struck him, or the one kills and the other dies, the\nsuffering and the doing are divided into unequal shares; well, the\njudge tries to restore equality by penalty, thereby taking from the\ngain.\nFor these terms gain and loss are applied to these cases, though\nperhaps the term in some particular instance may not be strictly\nproper, as gain, for instance, to the man who has given a blow, and\nloss to him who has received it: still, when the suffering has been\nestimated, the one is called loss and the other gain.\nAnd so the equal is a mean between the more and the less, which\nrepresent gain and loss in contrary ways (I mean, that the more of good\nand the less of evil is gain, the less of good and the more of evil is\nloss): between which the equal was stated to be a mean, which equal we\nsay is Just: and so the Corrective Just must be the mean between loss\nand gain. And this is the reason why, upon a dispute arising, men have\nrecourse to the judge: going to the judge is in fact going to the Just,\nfor the judge is meant to be the personification of the Just.[13] And\nmen seek a judge as one in the mean, which is expressed in a name given\nby some to judges (\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, or middle-men) under the notion that if\nthey can hit on the mean they shall hit on the Just. The Just is then\nsurely a mean since the judge is also.\nSo it is the office of a judge to make things equal, and the line, as\nit were, having been unequally divided, he takes from the greater part\nthat by which it exceeds the half, and adds this on to the less. And\nwhen the whole is divided into two exactly equal portions then men say\nthey have their own, when they have gotten the equal; and the equal is\na mean between the greater and the less according to arithmetical\nequality.\nThis, by the way, accounts for the etymology of the term by which we in\nGreek express the ideas of Just and Judge; (\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd quasi \u03b4\u03af\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, that\nis in two parts, and \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 quasi \u03b4\u03b9\u03c7\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, he who divides into two\nparts). For when from one of two equal magnitudes somewhat has been\ntaken and added to the other, this latter exceeds the former by twice\nthat portion: if it had been merely taken from the former and not added\nto the latter, then the latter would have exceeded the former only by\nthat one portion; but in the other case, the greater exceeds the mean\nby one, and the mean exceeds also by one that magnitude from which the\nportion was taken. By this illustration, then, we obtain a rule to\ndetermine what one ought to take from him who has the greater, and what\nto add to him who has the less. The excess of the mean over the less\nmust be added to the less, and the excess of the greater over the mean\nbe taken from the greater.\nThus let there be three straight lines equal to one another. From one\nof them cut off a portion, and add as much to another of them. The\nwhole line thus made will exceed the remainder of the first-named line,\nby twice the portion added, and will exceed the untouched line by that\nportion.[14] And these terms loss and gain are derived from voluntary\nexchange: that is to say, the having more than what was one\u2019s own is\ncalled gaining, and the having less than one\u2019s original stock is called\nlosing; for instance, in buying or selling, or any other transactions\nwhich are guaranteed by law: but when the result is neither more nor\nless, but exactly the same as there was originally,[15] people say they\nhave their own, and neither lose nor gain.\nSo then the Just we have been speaking of is a mean between loss and\ngain arising in involuntary transactions; that is, it is the having the\nsame after the transaction as one had before it took place.\nChapter VIII.\nThere are people who have a notion that Reciprocation is simply just,\nas the Pythagoreans said: for they defined the Just simply and without\nqualification as \u201cThat which reciprocates with another.\u201d But this\nsimple Reciprocation will not fit on either to the Distributive Just,\nor the Corrective (and yet this is the interpretation they put on the\nRhadamanthian rule of Just,\nIf a man should suffer what he hath done, then there would be\nstraightforward justice;\u201d)\nfor in many cases differences arise: as, for instance, suppose one in\nauthority has struck a man, he is not to be struck in turn; or if a man\nhas struck one in authority, he must not only be struck but punished\nalso.[16] And again, the voluntariness or involuntariness of actions\nmakes a great difference.\nBut in dealings of exchange such a principle of Justice as this\nReciprocation forms the bond of union, but then it must be\nReciprocation according to proportion and not exact equality, because\nby proportionate reciprocity of action the social community is held\ntogether, For either Reciprocation of evil is meant, and if this be not\nallowed it is thought to be a servile condition of things: or else\nReciprocation of good, and if this be not effected then there is no\nadmission to participation which is the very bond of their union.\nAnd this is the moral of placing the Temple of the Graces (\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) in\nthe public streets; to impress the notion that there may be requital,\nthis being peculiar to \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2[17] because a man ought to requite with a\ngood turn the man who has done him a favour and then to become himself\nthe originator of another \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2, by doing him a favour.\nNow the acts of mutual giving in due proportion may be represented by\nthe diameters of a parallelogram, at the four angles of which the\nparties and their wares are so placed that the side connecting the\nparties be opposite to that connecting the wares, and each party be\nconnected by one side with his own ware, as in the accompanying\ndiagram.\n[Illustration]\nThe builder is to receive from the shoemaker of his ware, and to give\nhim of his own: if then there be first proportionate equality, and\n_then_ the Reciprocation takes place, there will be the just result\nwhich we are speaking of: if not, there is not the equal, nor will the\nconnection stand: for there is no reason why the ware of the one may\nnot be better than that of the other, and therefore before the exchange\nis made they must have been equalised. And this is so also in the other\narts: for they would have been destroyed entirely if there were not a\ncorrespondence in point of quantity and quality between the producer\nand the consumer. For, we must remember, no dealing arises between two\nof the same kind, two physicians, for instance; but say between a\nphysician and agriculturist, or, to state it generally, between those\nwho are different and not equal, but these of course must have been\nequalised before the exchange can take place.\nIt is therefore indispensable that all things which can be exchanged\nshould be capable of comparison, and for this purpose money has come\nin, and comes to be a kind of medium, for it measures all things and so\nlikewise the excess and defect; for instance, how many shoes are equal\nto a house or a given quantity of food. As then the builder to the\nshoemaker, so many shoes must be to the house (or food, if instead of a\nbuilder an agriculturist be the exchanging party); for unless there is\nthis proportion there cannot be exchange or dealing, and this\nproportion cannot be unless the terms are in some way equal; hence the\nneed, as was stated above, of some one measure of all things. Now this\nis really and truly the Demand for them, which is the common bond of\nall such dealings. For if the parties were not in want at all or not\nsimilarly of one another\u2019s wares, there would either not be any\nexchange, or at least not the same.\nAnd money has come to be, by general agreement, a representative of\nDemand: and the account of its Greek name \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 is this, that it is\nwhat it is not naturally but by custom or law (\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), and it rests\nwith us to change its value, or make it wholly useless.\nVery well then, there will be Reciprocation when the terms have been\nequalised so as to stand in this proportion; Agriculturist : Shoemaker\n: : wares of Shoemaker : wares of Agriculturist; but you must bring\nthem to this form of proportion when they exchange, otherwise the one\nextreme will combine both exceedings of the mean:[18] but when they\nhave exactly their own then they are equal and have dealings, because\nthe same equality can come to be in their case. Let A represent an\nagriculturist, C food, B a shoemaker, D his wares equalised with A\u2019s.\nThen the proportion will be correct, A:B::C:D; _now_ Reciprocation will\nbe practicable, if it were not, there would have been no dealing.\nNow that what connects men in such transactions is Demand, as being\nsome one thing, is shown by the fact that, when either one does not\nwant the other or neither want one another, they do not exchange at\nall: whereas they do[19] when one wants what the other man has, wine\nfor instance, giving in return corn for exportation.\nAnd further, money is a kind of security to us in respect of exchange\nat some future time (supposing that one wants nothing now that we shall\nhave it when we do): the theory of money being that whenever one brings\nit one can receive commodities in exchange: of course this too is\nliable to depreciation, for its purchasing power is not always the\nsame, but still it is of a more permanent nature than the commodities\nit represents. And this is the reason why all things should have a\nprice set upon them, because thus there may be exchange at any time,\nand if exchange then dealing. So money, like a measure, making all\nthings commensurable equalises them: for if there was not exchange\nthere would not have been dealing, nor exchange if there were not\nequality, nor equality if there were not the capacity of being\ncommensurate: it is impossible that things so greatly different should\nbe really commensurate, but we can approximate sufficiently for all\npractical purposes in reference to Demand. The common measure must be\nsome one thing, and also from agreement (for which reason it is called\n\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1), for this makes all things commensurable: in fact, all things\nare measured by money. Let B represent ten min\u00e6, A a house worth five\nmin\u00e6, or in other words half B, C a bed worth 1/10th of B: it is clear\nthen how many beds are equal to one house, namely, five.\nIt is obvious also that exchange was thus conducted before the\nexistence of money: for it makes no difference whether you give for a\nhouse five beds or the price of five beds.\nChapter IX.\nWe have now said then what the abstract Just and Unjust are, and these\nhaving been defined it is plain that just acting is a mean between\nacting unjustly and being acted unjustly towards: the former being\nequivalent to having more, and the latter to having less.\nBut Justice, it must be observed, is a mean state not after the same\nmanner as the forementioned virtues, but because it aims at producing\nthe mean, while Injustice occupies _both_ the extremes.\nAnd Justice is the moral state in virtue of which the just man is said\nto have the aptitude for practising the Just in the way of moral\nchoice, and for making division between, himself and another, or\nbetween two other men, not so as to give to himself the greater and to\nhis neighbour the less share of what is choice-worthy and contrariwise\nof what is hurtful, but what is proportionably equal, and in like\nmanner when adjudging the rights of two other men.\nInjustice is all this with respect to the Unjust: and since the Unjust\nis excess or defect of what is good or hurtful respectively, in\nviolation of the proportionate, therefore Injustice is both excess and\ndefect because it aims at producing excess and defect; excess, that is,\nin a man\u2019s own case of what is simply advantageous, and defect of what\nis hurtful: and in the case of other men in like manner generally\nspeaking, only that the proportionate is violated not always in one\ndirection as before but whichever way it happens in the given case. And\nof the Unjust act the less is being acted unjustly towards, and the\ngreater the acting unjustly towards others.[20]\nLet this way of describing the nature of Justice and Injustice, and\nlikewise the Just and the Unjust generally, be accepted as sufficient.\nChapter X.\n[Again, since a man may do unjust acts and not yet have formed a\ncharacter of injustice, the question arises whether a man is unjust in\neach particular form of injustice, say a thief, or adulterer, or\nrobber, by doing acts of a given character.\nWe may say, I think, that this will not of itself make any difference;\na man may, for instance, have had connection with another\u2019s wife,\nknowing well with whom he was sinning, but he may have done it not of\ndeliberate choice but from the impulse of passion: of course he acts\nunjustly, but he has not necessarily formed an unjust character: that\nis, he may have stolen yet not be a thief; or committed an act of\nadultery but still not be an adulterer, and so on in other cases which\nmight be enumerated.][21]\nOf the relation which Reciprocation bears to the Just we have already\nspoken: and here it should be noticed that the Just which we are\ninvestigating is both the Just in the abstract and also as exhibited in\nSocial Relations, which latter arises in the case of those who live in\ncommunion with a view to independence and who are free and equal either\nproportionately or numerically.[22]\nIt follows then that those who are not in this position have not among\nthemselves the Social Just, but still Just of some kind and resembling\nthat other. For Just implies mutually acknowledged law, and law the\npossibility of injustice, for adjudication is the act of distinguishing\nbetween the Just and the Unjust.\nAnd among whomsoever there is the possibility of injustice among these\nthere is that of acting unjustly; but it does not hold conversely that\ninjustice attaches to all among whom there is the possibility of acting\nunjustly, since by the former we mean giving one\u2019s self the larger\nshare of what is abstractedly good and the less of what is abstractedly\nevil.\nThis, by the way, is the reason why we do not allow a man to govern,\nbut Principle, because a man governs for himself and comes to be a\ndespot: but the office of a ruler is to be guardian of the Just and\ntherefore of the Equal. Well then, since he seems to have no peculiar\npersonal advantage, supposing him a Just man, for in this case he does\nnot allot to himself the larger share of what is abstractedly good\nunless it falls to his share proportionately (for which reason he\nreally governs for others, and so Justice, men say, is a good not to\none\u2019s self so much as to others, as was mentioned before), therefore\nsome compensation must be given him, as there actually is in the shape\nof honour and privilege; and wherever these are not adequate there\nrulers turn into despots.\nBut the Just which arises in the relations of Master and Father, is not\nidentical with, but similar to, these; because there is no possibility\nof injustice towards those things which are absolutely one\u2019s own; and a\nslave or child (so long as this last is of a certain age and not\nseparated into an independent being), is, as it were, part of a man\u2019s\nself, and no man chooses to hurt himself, for which reason there cannot\nbe injustice towards one\u2019s own self: therefore neither is there the\nsocial Unjust or Just, which was stated to be in accordance with law\nand to exist between those among whom law naturally exists, and these\nwere said to be they to whom belongs equality of ruling and being\nruled.\nHence also there is Just rather between a man and his wife than between\na man and his children or slaves; this is in fact the Just arising in\ndomestic relations: and this too is different from the Social Just.\nFurther, this last-mentioned Just is of two kinds, natural and\nconventional; the former being that which has everywhere the same force\nand does not depend upon being received or not; the latter being that\nwhich originally may be this way or that indifferently but not after\nenactment: for instance, the price of ransom being fixed at a mina, or\nthe sacrificing a goat instead of two sheep; and again, all cases of\nspecial enactment, as the sacrificing to Brasidas as a hero; in short,\nall matters of special decree.\nBut there are some men who think that all the Justs are of this latter\nkind, and on this ground: whatever exists by nature, they say, is\nunchangeable and has everywhere the same force; fire, for instance,\nburns not here only but in Persia as well, but the Justs they see\nchanged in various places.\nNow this is not really so, and yet it is in a way (though among the\ngods perhaps by no means): still even amongst ourselves there is\nsomewhat existing by nature: allowing that everything is subject to\nchange, still there is that which does exist by nature, and that which\ndoes not.[23]\nNay, we may go further, and say that it is practically plain what among\nthings which can be otherwise does exist by nature, and what does not\nbut is dependent upon enactment and conventional, even granting that\nboth are alike subject to be changed: and the same distinctive\nillustration will apply to this and other cases; the right hand is\nnaturally the stronger, still some men may become equally strong in\nboth.\nA parallel may be drawn between the Justs which depend upon convention\nand expedience, and measures; for wine and corn measures are not equal\nin all places, but where men buy they are large, and where these same\nsell again they are smaller: well, in like manner the Justs which are\nnot natural, but of human invention, are not everywhere the same, for\nnot even the forms of government are, and yet there is one only which\nby nature would be best in all places.\nChapter XI.\nNow of Justs and Lawfuls each bears to the acts which embody and\nexemplify it the relation of an universal to a particular; the acts\nbeing many, but each of the principles only singular because each is an\nuniversal. And so there is a difference between an unjust act and the\nabstract Unjust, and the just act and the abstract Just: I mean, a\nthing is unjust in itself, by nature or by ordinance; well, when this\nhas been embodied in act, there is an unjust act, but not till then,\nonly some unjust thing.[24] And similarly of a just act. (Perhaps\n\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 is more correctly the common or generic term for just\nact, the word \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1, which I have here used, meaning generally and\nproperly the act corrective of the unjust act.) Now as to each of them,\nwhat kinds there are, and how many, and what is their object-matter, we\nmust examine afterwards.\nFor the present we proceed to say that, the Justs and the Unjusts being\nwhat have been mentioned, a man is said to act unjustly or justly when\nhe embodies these abstracts in voluntary actions, but when in\ninvoluntary, then he neither acts unjustly or justly except\naccidentally; I mean that the being just or unjust is really only\naccidental to the agents in such cases.\nSo both unjust and just actions are limited by the being voluntary or\nthe contrary: for when an embodying of the Unjust is voluntary, then it\nis blamed and is at the same time also an unjust action: but, if\nvoluntariness does not attach, there will be a thing which is in itself\nunjust but not yet an unjust action.\nBy voluntary, I mean, as we stated before, whatsoever of things in his\nown power a man does with knowledge, and the absence of ignorance as to\nthe person to whom, or the instrument with which, or the result with\nwhich he does; as, for instance, whom he strikes, what he strikes him\nwith, and with what probable result; and each of these points again,\nnot accidentally nor by compulsion; as supposing another man were to\nseize his hand and strike a third person with it, here, of course, the\nowner of the hand acts not voluntarily, because it did not rest with\nhim to do or leave undone: or again, it is conceivable that the person\nstruck may be his father, and he may know that it is a man, or even one\nof the present company, whom he is striking, but not know that it is\nhis father. And let these same distinctions be supposed to be carried\ninto the case of the result and in fact the whole of any given action.\nIn fine then, that is involuntary which is done through ignorance, or\nwhich, not resulting from ignorance, is not in the agent\u2019s control or\nis done on compulsion.\nI mention these cases, because there are many natural things which we\ndo and suffer knowingly but still no one of which is either voluntary\nor involuntary, growing old, or dying, for instance.\nAgain, accidentality may attach to the unjust in like manner as to the\njust acts. For instance, a man may have restored what was deposited\nwith him, but against his will and from fear of the consequences of a\nrefusal: we must not say that he either does what is just, or does\njustly, except accidentally: and in like manner the man who through\ncompulsion and against his will fails to restore a deposit, must be\nsaid to do unjustly, or to do what is unjust, accidentally only.\nAgain, voluntary actions we do either from deliberate choice or without\nit; from it, when we act from previous deliberation; without it, when\nwithout any previous deliberation. Since then hurts which may be done\nin transactions between man and man are threefold, those mistakes which\nare attended with ignorance are, when a man either does a thing not to\nthe man to whom he meant to do it, or not the thing he meant to do, or\nnot with the instrument, or not with the result which he intended:\neither he did not think he should hit him at all, or not with this, or\nthis is not the man he thought he should hit, or he did not think this\nwould be the result of the blow but a result has followed which he did\nnot anticipate; as, for instance, he did it not to wound but merely to\nprick him; or it is not the man whom, or the way in which, he meant.\nNow when the hurt has come about contrary to all reasonable\nexpectation, it is a Misadventure; when though not contrary to\nexpectation yet without any viciousness, it is a Mistake; for a man\nmakes a mistake when the origination of the cause rests with himself,\nhe has a misadventure when it is external to himself. When again he\nacts with knowledge, but not from previous deliberation, it is an\nunjust action; for instance, whatever happens to men from anger or\nother passions which are necessary or natural: for when doing these\nhurts or making these mistakes they act unjustly of course and their\nactions are unjust, still they are not yet confirmed unjust or wicked\npersons by reason of these, because the hurt did not arise from\ndepravity in the doer of it: but when it does arise from deliberate\nchoice, then the doer is a confirmed unjust and depraved man.\nAnd on this principle acts done from anger are fairly judged not to be\nfrom malice prepense, because it is not the man who acts in wrath who\nis the originator really but he who caused his wrath. And again, the\nquestion at issue in such cases is not respecting the fact but\nrespecting the justice of the case, the occasion of anger being a\nnotion of injury.[25] I mean, that the parties do not dispute about the\nfact, as in questions of contract (where one of the two must be a\nrogue, unless real forgetfulness can be pleaded), but, admitting the\nfact, they dispute on which side the justice of the case lies (the one\nwho plotted against the other, _i.e._ the real aggressor, of course,\ncannot be ignorant),[26] so that the one thinks there is injustice\ncommitted while the other does not.\nWell then, a man acts unjustly if he has hurt another of deliberate\npurpose, and he who commits such acts of injustice is _ipso facto_ an\nunjust character when they are in violation of the proportionate or the\nequal; and in like manner also a man is a just character when he acts\njustly of deliberate purpose, and he does act justly if he acts\nvoluntarily.\nThen as for involuntary acts of harm, they are either such as are\nexcusable or such as are not: under the former head come all errors\ndone not merely in ignorance but from ignorance; under the latter all\nthat are done not from ignorance but in ignorance caused by some\npassion which is neither natural nor fairly attributable to human\ninfirmity.\nChapter XII.\nNow a question may be raised whether we have spoken with sufficient\ndistinctness as to being unjustly dealt with, and dealing unjustly\ntowards others.\nFirst, whether the case is possible which Euripides has put, saying\nsomewhat strangely,\n\u201cMy mother he hath slain;  the tale is short,\nEither he willingly did slay her willing,\nOr else with her will but against his own.\u201d\nI mean then, is it really possible for a person to be unjustly dealt\nwith with his own consent, or must every case of being unjustly dealt\nwith be against the will of the sufferer as every act of unjust dealing\nis voluntary?\nAnd next, are cases of being unjustly dealt with to be ruled all one\nway as every act of unjust dealing is voluntary? or may we say that\nsome cases are voluntary and some involuntary?\nSimilarly also as regards being justly dealt with: all just acting is\nvoluntary, so that it is fair to suppose that the being dealt with\nunjustly or justly must be similarly opposed, as to being either\nvoluntary or involuntary.\nNow as for being justly dealt with, the position that every case of\nthis is voluntary is a strange one, for some are certainly justly dealt\nwith without their will.[27] The fact is a man may also fairly raise\nthis question, whether in every case he who has suffered what is unjust\nis therefore unjustly dealt with, or rather that the case is the same\nwith suffering as it is with acting; namely that in both it is possible\nto participate in what is just, but only accidentally. Clearly the case\nof what is unjust is similar: for doing things in themselves unjust is\nnot identical with acting unjustly, nor is suffering them the same as\nbeing unjustly dealt with. So too of acting justly and being justly\ndealt with, since it is impossible to be unjustly dealt with unless\nsome one else acts unjustly or to be justly dealt with unless some one\nelse acts justly.\nNow if acting unjustly is simply \u201churting another voluntarily\u201d (by\nwhich I mean, knowing whom you are hurting, and wherewith, and how you\nare hurting him), and the man who fails of self-control voluntarily\nhurts himself, then this will be a case of being voluntarily dealt\nunjustly with, and it will be possible for a man to deal unjustly with\nhimself. (This by the way is one of the questions raised, whether it is\npossible for a man to deal unjustly with himself.) Or again, a man may,\nby reason of failing of self-control, receive hurt from another man\nacting voluntarily, and so here will be another case of being unjustly\ndealt with voluntarily.\nThe solution, I take it, is this: the definition of being unjustly\ndealt with is not correct, but we must add, to the hurting with the\nknowledge of the person hurt and the instrument and the manner of\nhurting him, the fact of its being against the wish of the man who is\nhurt.\nSo then a man may be hurt and suffer what is in itself unjust\nvoluntarily, but unjustly dealt with voluntarily no man can be: since\nno man wishes to be hurt, not even he who fails of self-control, who\nreally acts contrary to his wish: for no man wishes for that which he\ndoes not _think_ to be good, and the man who fails of self-control does\nnot what he thinks he ought to do.\nAnd again, he that gives away his own property (as Homer says Glaucus\ngave to Diomed, \u201carmour of gold for brass, armour worth a hundred oxen\nfor that which was worth but nine\u201d) is not unjustly dealt with, because\nthe giving rests entirely with himself; but being unjustly dealt with\ndoes not, there must be some other person who is dealing unjustly\ntowards him.\nWith respect to being unjustly dealt with then, it is clear that it is\nnot voluntary.\nChapter XIII.\nThere remain yet two points on which we purposed to speak: first, is he\nchargeable with an unjust act who in distribution has _given_ the\nlarger share to one party contrary to the proper rate, or he that _has_\nthe larger share? next, can a man deal unjustly by himself?\nIn the first question, if the first-named alternative is possible and\nit is the distributor who acts unjustly and not he who has the larger\nshare, then supposing that a person knowingly and willingly gives more\nto another than to himself here is a case of a man dealing unjustly by\nhimself; which, in fact, moderate men are thought to do, for it is a\ncharacteristic of the equitable man to take less than his due.\nIs not this the answer? that the case is not quite fairly stated,\nbecause of some other good, such as credit or the abstract honourable,\nin the supposed case the man did get the larger share. And again, the\ndifficulty is solved by reference to the definition of unjust dealing:\nfor the man suffers nothing contrary to his own wish, so that, on this\nscore at least, he is not unjustly dealt with, but, if anything, he is\nhurt only.\nIt is evident also that it is the distributor who acts unjustly and not\nthe man who has the greater share: because the mere fact of the\nabstract Unjust attaching to what a man does, does not constitute\nunjust action, but the doing this voluntarily: and voluntariness\nattaches to that quarter whence is the origination of the action, which\nclearly is in the distributor not in the receiver. And again the term\ndoing is used in several senses; in one sense inanimate objects kill,\nor the hand, or the slave by his master\u2019s bidding; so the man in\nquestion does not act unjustly but does things which are in themselves\nunjust.\nAgain, suppose that a man has made a wrongful award in ignorance; in\nthe eye of the law he does not act unjustly nor is his awarding unjust,\nbut yet he is in a certain sense: for the Just according to law and\nprimary or natural Just are not coincident: but, if he knowingly\ndecided unjustly, then he himself as well as the receiver got the\nlarger share, that is, either of favour from the receiver or private\nrevenge against the other party: and so the man who decided unjustly\nfrom these motives gets a larger share, in exactly the same sense as a\nman would who received part of the actual matter of the unjust action:\nbecause in this case the man who wrongly adjudged, say a field, did not\nactually get land but money by his unjust decision.\nChapter XIV.\nNow men suppose that acting Unjustly rests entirely with themselves,\nand conclude that acting Justly is therefore also easy. But this is not\nreally so; to have connection with a neighbour\u2019s wife, or strike one\u2019s\nneighbour, or give the money with one\u2019s hand, is of course easy and\nrests with one\u2019s self: but the doing these acts with certain inward\ndispositions neither is easy nor rests entirely with one\u2019s self. And in\nlike way, the knowing what is Just and what Unjust men think no great\ninstance of wisdom because it is not hard to comprehend those things of\nwhich the laws speak. They forget that these are not Just actions,\nexcept accidentally: to be Just they must be done and distributed in a\ncertain manner: and this is a more difficult task than knowing what\nthings are wholesome; for in this branch of knowledge it is an easy\nmatter to know honey, wine, hellebore, cautery, or the use of the\nknife, but the knowing how one should administer these with a view to\nhealth, and to whom and at what time, amounts in fact to being a\nphysician.\nFrom this very same mistake they suppose also, that acting Unjustly is\nequally in the power of the Just man, for the Just man no less, nay\neven more, than the Unjust, may be able to do the particular acts; he\nmay be able to have intercourse with a woman or strike a man; or the\nbrave man to throw away his shield and turn his back and run this way\nor that. True: but then it is not the mere doing these things which\nconstitutes acts of cowardice or injustice (except accidentally), but\nthe doing them with certain inward dispositions: just as it is not the\nmere using or not using the knife, administering or not administering\ncertain drugs, which constitutes medical treatment or curing, but doing\nthese things in a certain particular way.\nAgain the abstract principles of Justice have their province among\nthose who partake of what is abstractedly good, and can have too much\nor too little of these.[28] Now there are beings who cannot have too\nmuch of them, as perhaps the gods; there are others, again, to whom no\nparticle of them is of use, those who are incurably wicked to whom all\nthings are hurtful; others to whom they are useful to a certain degree:\nfor this reason then the province of Justice is among _Men_.\nChapter XV.\nWe have next to speak of Equity and the Equitable, that is to say, of\nthe relations of Equity to Justice and the Equitable to the Just; for\nwhen we look into the matter the two do not appear identical nor yet\ndifferent in kind; and we sometimes commend the Equitable and the man\nwho embodies it in his actions, so that by way of praise we commonly\ntransfer the term also to other acts instead of the term good, thus\nshowing that the more Equitable a thing is the better it is: at other\ntimes following a certain train of reasoning we arrive at a difficulty,\nin that the Equitable though distinct from the Just is yet\npraiseworthy; it seems to follow either that the Just is not good or\nthe Equitable not Just, since they are by hypothesis different; or if\nboth are good then they are identical.\nThis is a tolerably fair statement of the difficulty which on these\ngrounds arises in respect of the Equitable; but, in fact, all these may\nbe reconciled and really involve no contradiction: for the Equitable is\nJust, being also better than one form of Just, but is not better than\nthe Just as though it were different from it in kind: Just and\nEquitable then are identical, and, both being good, the Equitable is\nthe better of the two.\nWhat causes the difficulty is this; the Equitable is Just, but not the\nJust which is in accordance with written law, being in fact a\ncorrection of that kind of Just. And the account of this is, that every\nlaw is necessarily universal while there are some things which it is\nnot possible to speak of rightly in any universal or general statement.\nWhere then there is a necessity for general statement, while a general\nstatement cannot apply rightly to all cases, the law takes the\ngenerality of cases, being fully aware of the error thus involved; and\nrightly too notwithstanding, because the fault is not in the law, or in\nthe framer of the law, but is inherent in the nature of the thing,\nbecause the matter of all action is necessarily such.\nWhen then the law has spoken in general terms, and there arises a case\nof exception to the general rule, it is proper, in so far as the\nlawgiver omits the case and by reason of his universality of statement\nis wrong, to set right the omission by ruling it as the lawgiver\nhimself would rule were he there present, and would have provided by\nlaw had he foreseen the case would arise. And so the Equitable is Just\nbut better than one form of Just; I do not mean the abstract Just but\nthe error which arises out of the universality of statement: and this\nis the nature of the Equitable, \u201ca correction of Law, where Law is\ndefective by reason of its universality.\u201d\nThis is the reason why not all things are according to law, because\nthere are things about which it is simply impossible to lay down a law,\nand so we want special enactments for particular cases. For to speak\ngenerally, the rule of the undefined must be itself undefined also,\njust as the rule to measure Lesbian building is made of lead: for this\nrule shifts according to the form of each stone and the special\nenactment according to the facts of the case in question.\nIt is clear then what the Equitable is; namely that it is Just but\nbetter than one form of Just: and hence it appears too who the\nEquitable man is: he is one who has a tendency to choose and carry out\nthese principles, and who is not apt to press the letter of the law on\nthe worse side but content to waive his strict claims though backed by\nthe law: and this moral state is Equity, being a species of Justice,\nnot a different moral state from Justice.\nChapter XVI.\nThe answer to the second of the two questions indicated above, \u201cwhether\nit is possible for a man to deal unjustly by himself,\u201d is obvious from\nwhat has been already stated.\nIn the first place, one class of Justs is those which are enforced by\nlaw in accordance with Virtue in the most extensive sense of the term:\nfor instance, the law does not bid a man kill himself; and whatever it\ndoes not bid it forbids: well, whenever a man does hurt contrary to the\nlaw (unless by way of requital of hurt), voluntarily, i.e. knowing to\nwhom he does it and wherewith, he acts Unjustly. Now he that from rage\nkills himself, voluntarily, does this in contravention of Right Reason,\nwhich the law does not permit. He therefore acts Unjustly: but towards\nwhom? towards the Community, not towards himself (because he suffers\nwith his own consent, and no man can be Unjustly dealt with with his\nown consent), and on this principle the Community punishes him; that is\na certain infamy is attached to the suicide as to one who acts Unjustly\ntowards the Community.\nNext, a man cannot deal Unjustly by himself in the sense in which a man\nis Unjust who only does Unjust acts without being entirely bad (for the\ntwo things are different, because the Unjust man is in a way bad, as\nthe coward is, not as though he were chargeable with badness in the\nfull extent of the term, and so he does not act Unjustly in this\nsense), because if it were so then it would be possible for the same\nthing to have been taken away from and added to the same person:[29]\nbut this is really not possible, the Just and the Unjust always\nimplying a plurality of persons.\nAgain, an Unjust action must be voluntary, done of deliberate purpose,\nand aggressive (for the man who hurts because he has first suffered and\nis merely requiting the same is not thought to act Unjustly), but here\nthe man does to himself and suffers the same things at the same time.\nAgain, it would imply the possibility of being Unjustly dealt with with\none\u2019s own consent.\nAnd, besides all this, a man cannot act Unjustly without his act\nfalling under some particular crime; now a man cannot seduce his own\nwife, commit a burglary on his own premises, or steal his own property.\nAfter all, the general answer to the question is to allege what was\nsettled respecting being Unjustly dealt with with one\u2019s own consent.\nChapter XVII.\nIt is obvious, moreover, that being Unjustly dealt by and dealing\nUnjustly by others are both wrong; because the one is having less, the\nother having more, than the mean, and the case is parallel to that of\nthe healthy in the healing art, and that of good condition in the art\nof training: but still the dealing Unjustly by others is the worst of\nthe two, because this involves wickedness and is blameworthy;\nwickedness, I mean, either wholly, or nearly so (for not all voluntary\nwrong implies injustice), but the being Unjustly dealt by does not\ninvolve wickedness or injustice.\nIn itself then, the being Unjustly dealt by is the least bad, but\naccidentally it may be the greater evil of the two. However, scientific\nstatement cannot take in such considerations; a pleurisy, for instance,\nis called a greater physical evil than a bruise: and yet this last may\nbe the greater accidentally; it may chance that a bruise received in a\nfall may cause one to be captured by the enemy and slain.\nFurther: Just, in the way of metaphor and similitude, there may be I do\nnot say between a man and himself exactly but between certain parts of\nhis nature; but not Just of every kind, only such as belongs to the\nrelation of master and slave, or to that of the head of a family. For\nall through this treatise the rational part of the Soul has been viewed\nas distinct from the irrational.\nNow, taking these into consideration, there is thought to be a\npossibility of injustice towards one\u2019s self, because herein it is\npossible for men to suffer somewhat in contradiction of impulses really\ntheir own; and so it is thought that there is Just of a certain kind\nbetween these parts mutually, as between ruler and ruled.\nLet this then be accepted as an account of the distinctions which we\nrecognise respecting Justice and the rest of the moral virtues.[30]\nBOOK VI\nChapter I.\nHaving stated in a former part of this treatise that men should choose\nthe mean instead of either the excess or defect, and that the mean is\naccording to the dictates of Right Reason; we will now proceed to\nexplain this term.\nFor in all the habits which we have expressly mentioned, as likewise in\nall the others, there is, so to speak, a mark with his eye fixed on\nwhich the man who has Reason tightens or slacks his rope;[1] and there\nis a certain limit of those mean states which we say are in accordance\nwith Right Reason, and lie between excess on the one hand and defect on\nthe other.\nNow to speak thus is true enough but conveys no very definite meaning:\nas, in fact, in all other pursuits requiring attention and diligence on\nwhich skill and science are brought to bear; it is quite true of course\nto say that men are neither to labour nor relax too much or too little,\nbut in moderation, and as Right Reason directs; yet if this were all a\nman had he would not be greatly the wiser; as, for instance, if in\nanswer to the question, what are proper applications to the body, he\nwere to be told, \u201cOh! of course, whatever the science of medicine, and\nin such manner as the physician, directs.\u201d\nAnd so in respect of the mental states it is requisite not merely that\nthis should be true which has been already stated, but further that it\nshould be expressly laid down what Right Reason is, and what is the\ndefinition of it.\nChapter II.\nNow in our division of the Excellences of the Soul, we said there were\ntwo classes, the Moral and the Intellectual: the former we have already\ngone through; and we will now proceed to speak of the others, premising\na few words respecting the Soul itself. It was stated before, you will\nremember, that the Soul consists of two parts, the Rational, and\nIrrational: we must now make a similar division of the Rational.\nLet it be understood then that there are two parts of the Soul\npossessed of Reason; one whereby we realise those existences whose\ncauses cannot be otherwise than they are, and one whereby we realise\nthose which can be otherwise than they are,[2] (for there must be,\nanswering to things generically different, generically different parts\nof the soul naturally adapted to each, since these parts of the soul\npossess their knowledge in virtue of a certain resemblance and\nappropriateness in themselves to the objects of which they are\npercipients);[3] and let us name the former, \u201cthat which is apt to\nknow,\u201d the latter, \u201cthat which is apt to calculate\u201d (because\ndeliberating and calculating are the same, and no one ever deliberates\nabout things which cannot be otherwise than they are: and so the\nCalculative will be one part of the Rational faculty of the soul).\nWe must discover, then, which is the best state of each of these,\nbecause that will be the Excellence of each; and this again is relative\nto the work each has to do.[4]\nThere are in the Soul three functions on which depend moral action and\ntruth; Sense, Intellect, Appetition, whether vague Desire or definite\nWill. Now of these Sense is the originating cause of no moral action,\nas is seen from the fact that brutes have Sense but are in no way\npartakers of moral action.[5]\n[Intellect and Will are thus connected,] what in the Intellectual\noperation is Affirmation and Negation that in the Will is Pursuit and\nAvoidance, And so, since Moral Virtue is a State apt to exercise Moral\nChoice and Moral Choice is Will consequent on deliberation, the Reason\nmust be true and the Will right, to constitute good Moral Choice, and\nwhat the Reason affirms the Will must pursue.[6]\nNow this Intellectual operation and this Truth is what bears upon Moral\nAction; of course truth and falsehood must be the good and the bad of\nthat Intellectual Operation which is purely Speculative, and concerned\nneither with action nor production, because this is manifestly the work\nof every Intellectual faculty, while of the faculty which is of a mixed\nPractical and Intellectual nature, the work is that Truth which, as I\nhave described above, corresponds to the right movement of the Will.\nNow the starting-point of moral action is Moral Choice, (I mean, what\nactually sets it in motion, not the final cause,)[7] and of Moral\nChoice, Appetition, and Reason directed to a certain result: and thus\nMoral Choice is neither independent of intellect, i. e. intellectual\noperation, nor of a certain moral state: for right or wrong action\ncannot be, independently of operation of the Intellect, and moral\ncharacter.\nBut operation of the Intellect by itself moves nothing, only when\ndirected to a certain result, i. e. exercised in Moral Action: (I say\nnothing of its being exercised in production, because this function is\noriginated by the former: for every one who makes makes with a view to\nsomewhat further; and that which is or may be made, is not an End in\nitself, but only relatively to somewhat else, and belonging to some\none:[8] whereas that which is or may be done is an End in itself,\nbecause acting well is an End in itself, and this is the object of the\nWill,) and so Moral Choice is either[9] Intellect put in a position of\nWill-ing, or Appetition subjected to an Intellectual Process. And such\na Cause is Man.\nBut nothing which is done and past can be the object of Moral Choice;\nfor instance, no man chooses to have sacked Troy; because, in fact, no\none ever deliberates about what is past, but only about that which is\nfuture, and which may therefore be influenced, whereas what has been\ncannot not have been: and so Agathon is right in saying\n\u201cOf this alone is Deity bereft,\nTo make undone whatever hath been done.\u201d\nThus then Truth is the work of both the Intellectual Parts of the Soul;\nthose states therefore are the Excellences of each in which each will\nbest attain truth.\nChapter III.\nCommencing then from the point stated above we will now speak of these\nExcellences again. Let those faculties whereby the Soul attains truth\nin Affirmation or Negation, be assumed to be in number five:[10] viz.\nArt, Knowledge, Practical Wisdom, Science, Intuition: (Supposition and\nOpinion I do not include, because by these one may go wrong.)\nWhat Knowledge is, is plain from the following of considerations, if\none is to speak accurately, instead of being led away by resemblances.\nFor we all conceive that what we strictly speaking know, cannot be\notherwise than it is, because as to those things which can be otherwise\nthan they are, we are uncertain whether they are or are not, the moment\nthey cease to be within the sphere of our actual observation.\nSo then, whatever comes within the range of Knowledge is by necessity,\nand therefore eternal, (because all things are so which exist\nnecessarily,) and all eternal things are without beginning, and\nindestructible.\nAgain, all Knowledge is thought to be capable of being taught, and what\ncomes within its range capable of being learned. And all teaching is\nbased upon previous knowledge; (a statement you will find in the\nAnalytics also,)[11] for there are two ways of teaching, by Syllogism\nand by Induction. In fact. Induction is the source of universal\npropositions, and Syllogism reasons from these universals.[12]\nSyllogism then may reason from principles which cannot be themselves\nproved Syllogistically: and therefore must by Induction.\nSo Knowledge is \u201ca state or mental faculty apt to demonstrate\nsyllogistically,\u201d &c. as in the Analytics:[13] because a man, strictly\nand properly speaking, _knows_, when he establishes his conclusion in a\ncertain way, and the principles are known to him: for if they are not\nbetter known to him than the conclusion, such knowledge as he has will\nbe merely accidental.\nLet thus much be accepted as a definition of Knowledge.\nChapter IV.\nMatter which may exist otherwise than it actually does in any given\ncase (commonly called Contingent) is of two kinds, that which is the\nobject of Making, and that which is the object of Doing; now Making and\nDoing are two different things (as we show in the exoteric treatise),\nand so that state of mind, conjoined with Reason, which is apt to Do,\nis distinct from that also conjoined with Reason, which is apt to Make:\nand for this reason they are not included one by the other, that is,\nDoing is not Making, nor Making Doing.[14] Now[15] as Architecture is\nan Art, and is the same as \u201ca certain state of mind, conjoined with\nReason, which is apt to Make,\u201d and as there is no Art which is not such\na state, nor any such state which is not an Art, Art, in its strict and\nproper sense, must be \u201ca state of mind, conjoined with true Reason, apt\nto Make.\u201d\nNow all Art has to do with production, and contrivance, and seeing how\nany of those things may be produced which may either be or not be, and\nthe origination of which rests with the maker and not with the thing\nmade.\nAnd, so neither things which exist or come into being necessarily, nor\nthings in the way of nature, come under the province of Art, because\nthese are self-originating. And since Making and Doing are distinct,\nArt must be concerned with the former and not the latter. And in a\ncertain sense Art and Fortune are concerned with the same things, as,\nAgathon says by the way,\n\u201cArt Fortune loves, and is of her beloved.\u201d\nSo Art, as has been stated, is \u201ca certain state of mind, apt to Make,\nconjoined with true Reason;\u201d its absence, on the contrary, is the same\nstate conjoined with false Reason, and both are employed upon\nContingent matter.\nChapter V.\nAs for Practical Wisdom, we shall ascertain its nature by examining to\nwhat kind of persons we in common language ascribe it.[16]\nIt is thought then to be the property of the Practically Wise man to be\nable to deliberate well respecting what is good and expedient for\nhimself, not in any definite line,[17] as what is conducive to health\nor strength, but what to living well. A proof of this is that we call\nmen Wise in this or that, when they calculate well with a view to some\ngood end in a case where there is no definite rule. And so, in a\ngeneral way of speaking, the man who is good at deliberation will be\nPractically Wise. Now no man deliberates respecting things which cannot\nbe otherwise than they are, nor such as lie not within the range of his\nown action: and so, since Knowledge requires strict demonstrative\nreasoning, of which Contingent matter does not admit (I say Contingent\nmatter, because all matters of deliberation must be Contingent and\ndeliberation cannot take place with respect to things which are\nNecessarily), Practical Wisdom cannot be Knowledge nor Art; nor the\nformer, because what falls under the province of Doing must be\nContingent; not the latter, because Doing and Making are different in\nkind.\nIt remains then that it must be \u201ca state of mind true, conjoined with\nReason, and apt to Do, having for its object those things which are\ngood or bad for Man:\u201d because of Making something beyond itself is\nalways the object, but cannot be of Doing because the very well-doing\nis in itself an End.\nFor this reason we think Pericles and men of that stamp to be\nPractically Wise, because they can see what is good for themselves and\nfor men in general, and we also think those to be such who are skilled\nin domestic management or civil government. In fact, this is the reason\nwhy we call the habit of perfected self-mastery by the name which in\nGreek it bears, etymologically signifying \u201cthat which preserves the\nPractical Wisdom:\u201d for what it does preserve is the Notion I have\nmentioned, _i.e._ of one\u2019s own true interest.[18]\nFor it is not every kind of Notion which the pleasant and the painful\ncorrupt and pervert, as, for instance, that \u201cthe three angles of every\nrectilineal triangle are equal to two right angles,\u201d but only those\nbearing on moral action.\nFor the Principles of the matters of moral action are the final cause\nof them:[19] now to the man who has been corrupted by reason of\npleasure or pain the Principle immediately becomes obscured, nor does\nhe see that it is his duty to choose and act in each instance with a\nview to this final cause and by reason of it: for viciousness has a\ntendency to destroy the moral Principle: and so Practical Wisdom must\nbe \u201ca state conjoined with reason, true, having human good for its\nobject, and apt to do.\u201d\nThen again Art admits of degrees of excellence, but Practical Wisdom\ndoes not:[20] and in Art he who goes wrong purposely is preferable to\nhim who does so unwittingly,[21] but not so in respect of Practical\nWisdom or the other Virtues. It plainly is then an Excellence of a\ncertain kind, and not an Art.\nNow as there are two parts of the Soul which have Reason, it must be\nthe Excellence of the Opinionative [which we called before calculative\nor deliberative], because both Opinion and Practical Wisdom are\nexercised upon Contingent matter. And further, it is not simply a state\nconjoined with Reason, as is proved by the fact that such a state may\nbe forgotten and so lost while Practical Wisdom cannot.\nChapter VI.\nNow Knowledge is a conception concerning universals and Necessary\nmatter, and there are of course certain First Principles in all trains\nof demonstrative reasoning (that is of all Knowledge because this is\nconnected with reasoning): that faculty, then, which takes in the first\nprinciples of that which comes under the range of Knowledge, cannot be\neither Knowledge, or Art, or Practical Wisdom: not Knowledge, because\nwhat is the object of Knowledge must be derived from demonstrative\nreasoning; not either of the other two, because they are exercised upon\nContingent matter only. Nor can it be Science which takes in these,\nbecause the Scientific Man must in some cases depend on demonstrative\nReasoning.\nIt comes then to this: since the faculties whereby we always attain\ntruth and are never deceived when dealing with matter Necessary or even\nContingent are Knowledge, Practical Wisdom, Science, and Intuition, and\nthe faculty which takes in First Principles cannot be any of the three\nfirst; the last, namely Intuition, must be it which performs this\nfunction.\nChapter VII.\nScience is a term we use principally in two meanings: in the first\nplace, in the Arts we ascribe it to those who carry their arts to the\nhighest accuracy;[22] Phidias, for instance, we call a Scientific or\ncunning sculptor; Polycleitus a Scientific or cunning statuary;\nmeaning, in this instance, nothing else by Science than an excellence\nof art: in the other sense, we think some to be Scientific in a general\nway, not in any particular line or in any particular thing, just as\nHomer says of a man in his Margites; \u201cHim the Gods made neither a\ndigger of the ground, nor ploughman, nor in any other way Scientific.\u201d\nSo it is plain that Science must mean the most accurate of all\nKnowledge; but if so, then the Scientific man must not merely know the\ndeductions from the First Principles but be in possession of truth\nrespecting the First Principles. So that Science must be equivalent to\nIntuition and Knowledge; it is, so to speak, Knowledge of the most\nprecious objects, _with a head on_.[23]\nI say of the most precious things, because it is absurd to suppose\n\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74,[24] or Practical Wisdom, to be the highest, unless it can be\nshown that Man is the most excellent of all that exists in the\nUniverse. Now if \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d are relative terms, differing\nwhen applied to men or to fish, but \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cstraight\u201d are the same\nalways, men must allow that the Scientific is the same always, but the\nPractically Wise varies: for whatever provides all things well for\nitself, to this they would apply the term Practically Wise, and commit\nthese matters to it; which is the reason, by the way, that they call\nsome brutes Practically Wise, such that is as plainly have a faculty of\nforethought respecting their own subsistence.\nAnd it is quite plain that Science and \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 cannot be identical:\nbecause if men give the name of Science to that faculty which is\nemployed upon what is expedient for themselves, there will be many\ninstead of one, because there is not one and the same faculty employed\non the good of all animals collectively, unless in the same sense as\nyou may say there is one art of healing with respect to all living\nbeings.\nIf it is urged that man is superior to all other animals, that makes no\ndifference: for there are many other things more Godlike in their\nnature than Man, as, most obviously, the elements of which the Universe\nis composed.[25]\nIt is plain then that Science is the union of Knowledge and Intuition,\nand has for its objects those things which are most precious in their\nnature. Accordingly, Anexagoras, Thales, and men of that stamp, people\ncall Scientific, but not Practically Wise because they see them\nignorant of what concerns themselves; and they say that what they know\nis quite out of the common run certainly, and wonderful, and hard, and\nvery fine no doubt, but still useless because they do not seek after\nwhat is good for them as men.\nChapter VIII.\nBut Practical Wisdom is employed upon human matters, and such as are\nobjects of deliberation (for we say, that to deliberate well is most\npeculiarly the work of the man who possesses this Wisdom), and no man\ndeliberates about things which cannot be otherwise than they are, nor\nabout any save those that have some definite End and this End good\nresulting from Moral Action; and the man to whom we should give the\nname of Good in Counsel, simply and without modification, is he who in\nthe way of calculation has a capacity for attaining that of practical\ngoods which is the best for Man.\nNor again does Practical Wisdom consist in a knowledge of general\nprinciples only, but it is necessary that one should know also the\nparticular details, because it is apt to act, and action is concerned\nwith details: for which reason sometimes men who have not much\nknowledge are more practical than others who have; among others, they\nwho derive all they know from actual experience: suppose a man to know,\nfor instance, that light meats are easy of digestion and wholesome, but\nnot what kinds of meat are light, he will not produce a healthy state;\nthat man will have a much better chance of doing so, who knows that the\nflesh of birds is light and wholesome. Since then Practical Wisdom is\napt to act, one ought to have both kinds of knowledge, or, if only one,\nthe knowledge of details rather than of Principles. So there will be in\nrespect of Practical Wisdom the distinction of supreme and\nsubordinate.[26]\nFurther: \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 and Practical Wisdom are the same mental state, but\nthe point of view is not the same.\nOf Practical Wisdom exerted upon a community that which I would call\nthe Supreme is the faculty of Legislation; the subordinate, which is\nconcerned with the details, generally has the common name \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74, and\nits functions are Action and Deliberation (for the particular enactment\nis a matter of action, being the ultimate issue of this branch of\nPractical Wisdom, and therefore people commonly say, that these men\nalone are really engaged in government, because they alone act, filling\nthe same place relatively to legislators, that workmen do to a\nmaster).[27]\nAgain, that is thought to be Practical Wisdom in the most proper sense\nwhich has for its object the interest of the Individual: and this\nusually appropriates the common name: the others are called\nrespectively Domestic Management, Legislation, Executive Government\ndivided into two branches, Deliberative and Judicial.[28] Now of\ncourse, knowledge for one\u2019s self is one kind of knowledge, but it\nadmits of many shades of difference: and it is a common notion that the\nman who knows and busies himself about his own concerns merely is the\nman of Practical Wisdom, while they who extend their solicitude to\nsociety at large are considered meddlesome.\nEuripides has thus embodied this sentiment; \u201cHow,\u201d says one of his\nCharacters, \u201cHow foolish am I, who whereas I might have shared equally,\nidly numbered among the multitude of the army *** for them that are\nbusy and meddlesome [Jove hates],\u201d because the generality of mankind\nseek their own good and hold that this is their proper business. It is\nthen from this opinion that the notion has arisen that such men are the\nPractically-Wise. And yet it is just possible that the good of the\nindividual cannot be secured independently of connection with a family\nor a community. And again, how a man should manage his own affairs is\nsometimes not quite plain, and must be made a matter of enquiry.[29]\nA corroboration of what I have said is[30] the fact, that the young\ncome to be geometricians, and mathematicians, and Scientific in such\nmatters, but it is not thought that a young man can come to be\npossessed of Practical Wisdom: now the reason is, that this Wisdom has\nfor its object particular facts, which come to be known from\nexperience, which a young man has not because it is produced only by\nlength of time.\nBy the way, a person might also enquire,[31] why a boy may be made a\nmathematician but not Scientific or a natural philosopher. Is not this\nthe reason? that mathematics are taken in by the process of\nabstraction, but the principles of Science[32] and natural philosophy\nmust be gained by experiment; and the latter young men talk of but do\nnot realise, while the nature of the former is plain and clear.\nAgain, in matter of practice, error attaches either to the general\nrule, in the process of deliberation, or to the particular fact: for\ninstance, this would be a general rule, \u201cAll water of a certain gravity\nis bad;\u201d the particular fact, \u201cthis water is of that gravity.\u201d\nAnd that Practical Wisdom is not Knowledge is plain, for it has to do\nwith the ultimate issue,[33] as has been said, because every object of\naction is of this nature.\nTo Intuition it is opposed, for this takes in those principles which\ncannot be proved by reasoning, while Practical Wisdom is concerned with\nthe ultimate particular fact which cannot be realised by Knowledge but\nby Sense; I do not mean one of the five senses, but the same by which\nwe take in the mathematical fact, that no rectilineal figure can be\ncontained by less than three lines, i.e. that a triangle is the\nultimate figure, because here also is a stopping point.\nThis however is Sense rather than Practical Wisdom, which is of another\nkind.[34]\nChapter IX.\nNow the acts of enquiring and deliberating differ, though deliberating\nis a kind of enquiring. We ought to ascertain about Good Counsel\nlikewise what it is, whether a kind of Knowledge, or Opinion, or Happy\nConjecture, or some other kind of faculty. Knowledge it obviously is\nnot, because men do not enquire about what they know, and Good Counsel\nis a kind of deliberation, and the man who is deliberating is enquiring\nand calculating.\nNeither is it Happy Conjecture; because this is independent of\nreasoning, and a rapid operation; but men deliberate a long time, and\nit is a common saying that one should execute speedily what has been\nresolved upon in deliberation, but deliberate slowly.\nQuick perception of causes[35] again is a different faculty from good\ncounsel, for it is a species of Happy Conjecture. Nor is Good Counsel\nOpinion of any kind.\nWell then, since he who deliberates ill goes wrong, and he who\ndeliberates well does so rightly, it is clear that Good Counsel is\nrightness of some kind, but not of Knowledge nor of Opinion: for\nKnowledge cannot be called right because it cannot be wrong, and\nRightness of Opinion is Truth: and again, all which is the object of\nopinion is definitely marked out.[36]\nStill, however, Good Counsel is not independent of Reason, Does it\nremain then that it is a rightness of Intellectual Operation simply,\nbecause this does not amount to an assertion; and the objection to\nOpinion was that it is not a process of enquiry but already a definite\nassertion; whereas whosoever deliberates, whether well or ill, is\nengaged in enquiry and calculation.\nWell, Good Counsel is a Rightness of deliberation, and so the first\nquestion must regard the nature and objects of deliberation. Now\nremember Rightness is an equivocal term; we plainly do not mean\nRightness of any kind whatever; the \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2, for instance, or the bad\nman, will obtain by his calculation what he sets before him as an\nobject, and so he may be said to have deliberated _rightly_ in one\nsense, but will have attained a great evil. Whereas to have deliberated\nwell is thought to be a good, because Good Counsel is Rightness of\ndeliberation of such a nature as is apt to attain good.\nBut even this again you may get by false reasoning, and hit upon the\nright effect though not through right means,[37] your middle term being\nfallacious: and so neither will this be yet Good Counsel in consequence\nof which you get what you ought but not through proper means.\nAgain, one man may hit on a thing after long deliberation, another\nquickly. And so that before described will not be yet Good Counsel, but\nthe Rightness must be with reference to what is expedient; and you must\nhave a proper end in view, pursue it in a right manner and right time.\nOnce more. One may deliberate well either generally or towards some\nparticular End.[38] Good counsel in the general then is that which goes\nright towards that which is the End in a general way of consideration;\nin particular, that which does so towards some particular End.\nSince then deliberating well is a quality of men possessed of Practical\nWisdom, Good Counsel must be \u201cRightness in respect of what conduces to\na given End, of which[39] Practical Wisdom is the true conception.\u201d\nChapter X.\nThere is too the faculty of Judiciousness, and also its absence, in\nvirtue of which we call men Judicious or the contrary.\nNow Judiciousness is neither entirely identical with Knowledge or\nOpinion (for then all would have been Judicious), nor is it any one\nspecific science, as medical science whose object matter is things\nwholesome; or geometry whose object matter is magnitude: for it has not\nfor its object things which always exist and are immutable, nor of\nthose things which come into being just any which may chance; but those\nin respect of which a man might doubt and deliberate.\nAnd so it has the same object matter as Practical Wisdom; yet the two\nfaculties are not identical, because Practical Wisdom has the capacity\nfor commanding and taking the initiative, for its End is \u201cwhat one\nshould do or not do:\u201d but Judiciousness is only apt to decide upon\nsuggestions (though we do in Greek put \u201cwell\u201d on to the faculty and its\nconcrete noun, these really mean exactly the same as the plain words),\nand Judiciousness is neither the having Practical Wisdom, nor attaining\nit: but just as learning is termed \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 when a man uses his\nknowledge, so judiciousness consists in employing the Opinionative\nfaculty in judging concerning those things which come within the\nprovince of Practical Wisdom, when another enunciates them; and not\njudging merely, but judging well (for \u03b5\u1f50 and \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c2 mean exactly the\nsame thing). And the Greek name of this faculty is derived from the use\nof the term \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 in learning: \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd and \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 being often\nused as synonymous.\nThe faculty called \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7,[40] in right of which we call men \u03b5\u1f50\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2,\nor say they have \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7, is \u201cthe right judgment of the equitable man.\u201d A\nproof of which is that we most commonly say that the equitable man has\na tendency to make allowance, and the making allowance in certain cases\nis equitable. And \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7 (the word denoting allowance) is right \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7\nhaving a capacity of making equitable decisions, By \u201cright\u201d I mean that\nof the Truthful man.\nChapter XI.\nNow all these mental states[41] tend to the same object, as indeed\ncommon language leads us to expect: I mean, we speak of \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7,\nJudiciousness, Practical Wisdom, and Practical Intuition, attributing\nthe possession of \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7 and Practical Intuition to the same Individuals\nwhom we denominate Practically-Wise and Judicious: because all these\nfaculties are employed upon the extremes,[42] i.e. on particular\ndetails; and in right of his aptitude for deciding on the matters which\ncome within the province of the Practically-Wise, a man is Judicious\nand possessed of good \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7; i.e. he is disposed to make allowance, for\nconsiderations of equity are entertained by all good men alike in\ntransactions with their fellows.\nAnd all matters of Moral Action belong to the class of particulars,\notherwise called extremes: for the man of Practical Wisdom must know\nthem, and Judiciousness and \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7 are concerned with matters of Moral\nActions, which are extremes.\nIntuition, moreover, takes in the extremes at both ends:[43] I mean,\nthe first and last terms must be taken in not by reasoning but by\nIntuition [so that Intuition comes to be of two kinds], and that which\nbelongs to strict demonstrative reasonings takes in immutable, i.e.\nNecessary, first terms; while that which is employed in practical\nmatters takes in the extreme, the Contingent, and the minor\nPremiss:[44] for the minor Premisses are the source of the Final Cause,\nUniversals being made up out of Particulars.[45] To take in these, of\ncourse, we must have Sense, i.e. in other words Practical Intuition.\nAnd for this reason these are thought to be simply gifts of nature; and\nwhereas no man is thought to be Scientific by nature, men are thought\nto have \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7, and Judiciousness, and Practical Intuition: a proof of\nwhich is that we think these faculties are a consequence even of\nparticular ages, and this given age has Practical Intuition and \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7,\nwe say, as if under the notion that nature is the cause. And thus\nIntuition is both the beginning and end, because the proofs are based\nupon the one kind of extremes and concern the other.\nAnd so[46] one should attend to the undemonstrable dicta and opinions\nof the skilful, the old and the Practically-Wise, no less than to those\nwhich are based on strict reasoning, because they see aright, having\ngained their power of moral vision from experience.\nChapter XII.\nWell, we have now stated the nature and objects of Practical Wisdom and\nScience respectively, and that they belong each to a different part of\nthe Soul. But I can conceive a person questioning their utility.\n\u201cScience,\u201d he would say, \u201cconcerns itself with none of the causes of\nhuman happiness (for it has nothing to do with producing anything):\nPractical Wisdom has this recommendation, I grant, but where is the\nneed of it, since its province is those things which are just and\nhonourable, and good for man, and these are the things which the good\nman as such does; but we are not a bit the more apt to do them because\nwe know them, since the Moral Virtues are Habits; just as we are not\nmore apt to be healthy or in good condition from mere knowledge of what\nrelates to these (I mean,[47] of course, things so called not from\ntheir producing health, etc., but from their evidencing it in a\nparticular subject), for we are not more apt to be healthy and in good\ncondition merely from knowing the art of medicine or training.\n\u201cIf it be urged that _knowing what is_ good does not by itself make a\nPractically-Wise man but _becoming_ good; still this Wisdom will be no\nuse either to those that are good, and so have it already, or to those\nwho have it not; because it will make no difference to them whether\nthey have it themselves or put themselves under the guidance of others\nwho have; and we might be contented to be in respect of this as in\nrespect of health: for though we wish to be healthy still we do not set\nabout learning the art of healing.\n\u201cFurthermore, it would seem to be strange that, though lower in the\nscale than Science, it is to be its master; which it is, because\nwhatever produces results takes the rule and directs in each matter.\u201d\nThis then is what we are to talk about, for these are the only points\nnow raised.\nNow first we say that being respectively Excellences of different parts\nof the Soul they must be choice-worthy, even on the supposition that\nthey neither of them produce results.\nIn the next place we say that they _do_ produce results; that Science\nmakes Happiness, not as the medical art but as healthiness makes\nhealth:[48] because, being a part of Virtue in its most extensive\nsense, it makes a man happy by being possessed and by working.\nNext, Man\u2019s work _as Man_ is accomplished by virtue of Practical Wisdom\nand Moral Virtue, the latter giving the right aim and direction, the\nformer the right means to its attainment;[49] but of the fourth part of\nthe Soul, the mere nutritive principle, there is no such Excellence,\nbecause nothing is in its power to do or leave undone.[50]\nAs to our not being more apt to do what is noble and just by reason of\npossessing Practical Wisdom, we must begin a little higher up,[51]\ntaking this for our starting-point. As we say that men may do things in\nthemselves just and yet not be just men; for instance, when men do what\nthe laws require of them, either against their will, or by reason of\nignorance or something else, at all events not for the sake of the\nthings themselves; and yet they do what they ought and all that the\ngood man should do; so it seems that to be a good man one must do each\nact in a particular frame of mind, I mean from Moral Choice and for the\nsake of the things themselves which are done. Now it is Virtue which\nmakes the Moral Choice right, but whatever is naturally required to\ncarry out that Choice comes under the province not of Virtue but of a\ndifferent faculty. We must halt, as it were, awhile, and speak more\nclearly on these points.\nThere is then a certain faculty, commonly named Cleverness, of such a\nnature as to be able to do and attain whatever conduces to _any_ given\npurpose: now if that purpose be a good one the faculty is praiseworthy;\nif otherwise, it goes by a name which, denoting strictly the ability,\nimplies the willingness to do _anything_; we accordingly call the\nPractically-Wise Clever, and also those who can and will do\nanything.[52]\nNow Practical Wisdom is not identical with Cleverness, nor is it\nwithout this power of adapting means to ends: but this Eye of the Soul\n(as we may call it) does not attain its proper state without goodness,\nas we have said before and as is quite plain, because the syllogisms\ninto which Moral Action may be analysed have for their Major\nPremiss,[53] \u201csince \u2014\u2014 is the End and the Chief Good\u201d[54] (fill up the\nblank with just anything you please, for we merely want to exhibit the\nForm, so that anything will do), but _how_ this blank should be filled\nis seen only by the good man: because Vice distorts the moral vision\nand causes men to be deceived in respect of practical principles.[55]\nIt is clear, therefore, that a man cannot be a Practically-Wise,\nwithout being a good, man.\nWe must enquire again also about Virtue: for it may be divided into\nNatural Virtue and Matured, which two bear to each other a relation\nsimilar to that which Practical Wisdom bears to Cleverness, one not of\nidentity but resemblance. I speak of Natural Virtue, because men hold\nthat each of the moral dispositions attach to us all somehow by nature:\nwe have dispositions[56] towards justice, self-mastery and courage, for\ninstance, immediately from our birth: but still we seek Goodness in its\nhighest sense as something distinct from these, and that these\ndispositions should attach to us in a somewhat different fashion.[57]\nChildren and brutes have these natural states, but then they are\nplainly hurtful unless combined with an intellectual element: at least\nthus much is matter of actual experience and observation, that as a\nstrong body destitute of sight must, if set in motion, fall violently\nbecause it has not sight, so it is also in the case we are considering:\nbut if it can get the intellectual element it then excels in acting.\nJust so the Natural State of Virtue, being like this strong body, will\nthen be Virtue in the highest sense when it too is combined with the\nintellectual element.\nSo that, as in the case of the Opinionative faculty, there are two\nforms, Cleverness and Practical Wisdom; so also in the case of the\nMoral there are two, Natural Virtue and Matured; and of these the\nlatter cannot be formed without Practical Wisdom.[58]\nThis leads some to say that all the Virtues are merely intellectual\nPractical Wisdom, and Socrates was partly right in his enquiry and\npartly wrong: wrong in that he thought all the Virtues were merely\nintellectual Practical Wisdom, right in saying they were not\nindependent of that faculty.\nA proof of which is that now all, in defining Virtue, add on the\n\u201cstate\u201d [mentioning also to what standard it has reference, namely\nthat] \u201cwhich is accordant with Right Reason:\u201d now \u201cright\u201d means in\naccordance with Practical Wisdom. So then all seem to have an\ninstinctive notion that that state which is in accordance with\nPractical Wisdom is Virtue; however, we must make a slight change in\ntheir statement, because that state is Virtue, not merely which is in\naccordance with but which implies the possession of Right Reason;\nwhich, upon such matters, is Practical Wisdom. The difference between\nus and Socrates is this: he thought the Virtues were reasoning\nprocesses (_i.e._ that they were all instances of Knowledge in its\nstrict sense), but we say they imply the possession of Reason.\nFrom what has been said then it is clear that one cannot be, strictly\nspeaking, good without Practical Wisdom nor Practically-Wise without\nmoral goodness.\nAnd by the distinction between Natural and Matured Virtue one can meet\nthe reasoning by which it might be argued \u201cthat the Virtues are\nseparable because the same man is not by nature most inclined to all at\nonce so that he will have acquired this one before he has that other:\u201d\nwe would reply that this is possible with respect to the Natural\nVirtues but not with respect to those in right of which a man is\ndenominated simply good: because they will all belong to him together\nwith the one faculty of Practical Wisdom.\nIt is plain too that even had it not been apt to act we should have\nneeded it, because it is the Excellence of a part of the Soul; and that\nthe moral choice cannot be right independently of Practical Wisdom and\nMoral Goodness; because this gives the right End, that causes the doing\nthese things which conduce to the End.\nThen again, it is not Master of Science (i.e. of the superior part of\nthe Soul), just as neither is the healing art Master of health; for it\ndoes not make use of it, but looks how it may come to be: so it\ncommands for the sake of it but does not command it.\nThe objection is, in fact, about as valid as if a man should say\n\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 governs the gods because it gives orders about all things in\nthe communty.\nAPPENDIX\nOn \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c0\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7, from I. Post. Analyt. chap. i. and ii.\n(Such parts only are translated as throw light on the Ethics.)\nAll teaching, and all intellectual learning, proceeds on the basis of\nprevious knowledge, as will appear on an examination of all. The\nMathematical Sciences, and every other system, draw their conclusions\nin this method. So too of reasonings, whether by syllogism, or\ninduction: for both teach through what is previously known, the former\nassuming the premisses as from wise men, the latter proving universals\nfrom the evidentness of the particulars. In like manner too\nrhetoricians persuade, either through examples (which amounts to\ninduction), or through enthymemes (which amounts to syllogism).\nCHAP. II\nWell, we suppose that we _know_ things (in the strict and proper sense\nof the word) when we suppose ourselves to know the cause by reason of\nwhich the thing is to be the cause of it; and that this cannot be\notherwise. It is plain that the idea intended to be conveyed by the\nterm _knowing_ is something of this kind; because they who do not\nreally know suppose themselves thus related to the matter in hand and\nthey who do know really are so that of whatsoever there is properly\nspeaking Knowledge this cannot be otherwise than it is Whether or no\nthere is another way of knowing we will say afterwards, but we do say\nthat we know through demonstration, by which I mean a syllogism apt to\nproduce Knowledge, i.e. in right of which through having it, we know.\nIf Knowledge then is such as we have described it, the Knowledge\nproduced by demonstrative reasoning must be drawn from premisses _true_\nand _first_, and _incapable of syllogistic proof_, and _better known_,\nand _prior in order of time_, and _causes of the conclusion_, for so\nthe principles will be akin to the conclusion demonstrated.\n(Syllogism, of course there may be without such premisses, but it will\nnot be demonstration because it will not produce knowledge).\n_True_, they must be, because it is impossible to know that which is\nnot.\n_First_, that is indemonstrable, because, if demonstrable, he cannot be\nsaid to _know_ them who has no demonstration of them for knowing such\nthings as are demonstrable is the same as having demonstration of them.\n_Causes_ they must be, and _better known_, and _prior_ in time,\n_causes_, because we then know when we are acquainted with the cause,\nand _prior_, if causes, and _known beforehand_, not merely comprehended\nin idea but known to exist (The terms prior, and better known, bear two\nsenses for _prior by nature_ and _prior relatively to ourselves_ are\nnot the same, nor _better known by nature_, and _better known to us_ I\nmean, by _prior_ and _better known relatively to ourselves_, such\nthings as are nearer to sensation, but abstractedly so such as are\nfurther Those are furthest which are most universal those nearest which\nare particulars, and these are mutually opposed.)\nAnd by _first_, I mean _principles akin to the conclusion_, for\nprinciple means the same as first And the principle or first step in\ndemonstration is a proposition incapable of syllogistic proof, _i.e._\none to which there is none prior. Now of such syllogistic principles I\ncall that a \u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 which you cannot demonstrate, and which is\nunnecessary with a view to learning something else. That which is\nnecessary in order to learn something else is an Axiom.\nFurther, since one is to believe and know the thing by having a\nsyllogism of the kind called demonstration, and what constitutes it to\nbe such is the nature of the premisses, it is necessary not merely to\n_know before_, but to _know better than the conclusion_, either all or\nat least some of, the principles, because that which is the cause of a\nquality inhering in something else always inheres itself more as the\ncause of our loving is itself more lovable. So, since the principles\nare the cause of our knowing and behoving we know and believe them\nmore, because by reason of them we know also the conclusion following.\nFurther: the man who is to have the Knowledge which comes through\ndemonstration must not merely know and believe his principles better\nthan he does his conclusion, but he must believe nothing more firmly\nthan the contradictories of those principles out of which the contrary\nfallacy may be constructed: since he who _knows_, is to be simply and\nabsolutely infallible.\nBOOK VII\nChapter I.\nNext we must take a different point to start from,[1] and observe that\nof what is to be avoided in respect of moral character there are three\nforms; Vice, Imperfect Self-Control, and Brutishness. Of the two former\nit is plain what the contraries are, for we call the one Virtue, the\nother Self-Control; and as answering to Brutishness it will be most\nsuitable to assign Superhuman, i.e. heroical and godlike Virtue, as, in\nHomer, Priam says of Hector \u201cthat he was very excellent, nor was he\nlike the offspring of mortal man, but of a god.\u201d and so, if, as is\ncommonly said, men are raised to the position of gods by reason of very\nhigh excellence in Virtue, the state opposed to the Brutish will\nplainly be of this nature: because as brutes are not virtuous or\nvicious so neither are gods; but the state of these is something more\nprecious than Virtue, of the former something different in kind from\nVice.\nAnd as, on the one hand, it is a rare thing for a man to be godlike (a\nterm the Laced\u00e6monians are accustomed to use when they admire a man\nexceedingly; \u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u1f74\u03c1  they call him), so the brutish man is rare;\nthe character is found most among barbarians, and some cases of it are\ncaused by disease or maiming; also such men as exceed in vice all\nordinary measures we therefore designate by this opprobrious term.\nWell, we must in a subsequent place make some mention of this\ndisposition, and Vice has been spoken of before: for the present we\nmust speak of Imperfect Self-Control and its kindred faults of Softness\nand Luxury, on the one hand, and of Self-Control and Endurance on the\nother; since we are to conceive of them, not as being the same states\nexactly as Virtue and Vice respectively, nor again as differing in\nkind.\nAnd we should adopt the same course as before, i.e. state the\nphenomena, and, after raising and discussing difficulties which suggest\nthemselves, then exhibit, if possible, all the opinions afloat\nrespecting these affections of the moral character; or, if not all, the\ngreater part and the most important: for we may consider we have\nillustrated the matter sufficiently when the difficulties have been\nsolved, and such theories as are most approved are left as a residuum.\nThe chief points may be thus enumerated. It is thought,\nI. That Self-Control and Endurance belong to the class of things good\nand praiseworthy, while Imperfect Self-Control and Softness belong to\nthat of things low and blameworthy.\nII. That the man of Self-Control is identical with the man who is apt\nto abide by his resolution, and the man of Imperfect Self-Control with\nhim who is apt to depart from his resolution.\nIII. That the man of Imperfect Self-Control does things at the\ninstigation of his passions, knowing them to be wrong, while the man of\nSelf-Control, knowing his lusts to be wrong, refuses, by the influence\nof reason, to follow their suggestions.\nIV. That the man of Perfected Self-Mastery unites the qualities of\nSelf-Control and Endurance, and some say that every one who unites\nthese is a man of Perfect Self-Mastery, others do not.\nV. Some confound the two characters of the man who has _no_\nSelf-Control, and the man of _Imperfect Self-Control_, while others\ndistinguish between them.\nVI. It is sometimes said that the man of Practical Wisdom cannot be a\nman of Imperfect Self-Control, sometimes that men who are Practically\nWise and Clever are of Imperfect Self-Control.\nVII. Again, men are said to be of Imperfect Self-Control, not simply\nbut with the addition of the thing wherein, as in respect of anger, of\nhonour, and gain.\nThese then are pretty well the common statements.\nChapter II.\nNow a man may raise a question as to the nature of the right conception\nin violation of which a man fails of Self-Control.\nThat he can so fail when _knowing_ in the strict sense what is right\nsome say is impossible: for it is a strange thing, as Socrates thought,\nthat while Knowledge is present in his mind something else should\nmaster him and drag him about like a slave. Socrates in fact contended\ngenerally against the theory, maintaining there is no such state as\nthat of Imperfect Self-Control, for that no one acts contrary to what\nis best conceiving it to be best but by reason of ignorance what is\nbest.\nWith all due respect to Socrates, his account of the matter is at\nvariance with plain facts, and we must enquire with respect to the\naffection, if it be caused by ignorance what is the nature of the\nignorance: for that the man so failing does not suppose his acts to be\nright before he is under the influence of passion is quite plain.[2]\nThere are people who partly agree with Socrates and partly not: that\nnothing can be stronger than Knowledge they agree, but that no man acts\nin contravention of his conviction of what is better they do not agree;\nand so they say that it is not Knowledge, but only Opinion, which the\nman in question has and yet yields to the instigation of his pleasures.\nBut then, if it is Opinion and not Knowledge, that is it the opposing\nconception be not strong but only mild (as in the case of real doubt),\nthe not abiding by it in the face of strong lusts would be excusable:\nbut wickedness is not excusable, nor is anything which deserves blame.\nWell then, is it Practical Wisdom which in this case offers opposition:\nfor that is the strongest principle? The supposition is absurd, for we\nshall have the same man uniting Practical Wisdom and Imperfect\nSelf-Control, and surely no single person would maintain that it is\nconsistent with the character of Practical Wisdom to do voluntarily\nwhat is very wrong; and besides we have shown before that the very mark\nof a man of this character is aptitude to act, as distinguished from\nmere knowledge of what is right; because he is a man conversant with\nparticular details, and possessed of all the other virtues.\nAgain, if the having strong and bad lusts is necessary to the idea of\nthe man of Self-Control, this character cannot be identical with the\nman of Perfected Self-Mastery, because the having strong desires or bad\nones does not enter into the idea of this latter character: and yet the\nman of Self-Control must have such: for suppose them good; then the\nmoral state which should hinder a man from following their suggestions\nmust be bad, and so Self-Control would not be in all cases good:\nsuppose them on the other hand to be weak and not wrong, it would be\nnothing grand; nor anything great, supposing them to be wrong and weak.\nAgain, if Self-Control makes a man apt to abide by all opinions without\nexception, it may be bad, as suppose the case of a false opinion: and\nif Imperfect Self-Control makes a man apt to depart from all without\nexception, we shall have cases where it will be good; take that of\nNeoptolemus in the Philoctetes of Sophocles, for instance: he is to be\npraised for not abiding by what he was persuaded to by Ulysses, because\nhe was pained at being guilty of falsehood.\nOr again, false sophistical reasoning presents a difficulty: for\nbecause men wish to prove paradoxes that they may be counted clever\nwhen they succeed, the reasoning that has been used becomes a\ndifficulty: for the intellect is fettered; a man being unwilling to\nabide by the conclusion because it does not please his judgment, but\nunable to advance because he cannot disentangle the web of sophistical\nreasoning.\nOr again, it is conceivable on this supposition that folly joined with\nImperfect Self-Control may turn out, in a given case, goodness: for by\nreason of his imperfection of self-control a man acts in a way which\ncontradicts his notions; now his notion is that what is really good is\nbad and ought not to be done; and so he will eventually do what is good\nand not what is bad.\nAgain, on the same supposition, the man who acting on conviction\npursues and chooses things because they are pleasant must be thought a\nbetter man than he who does so not by reason of a quasi-rational\nconviction but of Imperfect Self-Control: because he is more open to\ncure by reason of the possibility of his receiving a contrary\nconviction. But to the man of Imperfect Self-Control would apply the\nproverb, \u201cwhen water chokes, what should a man drink then?\u201d for had he\nnever been convinced at all in respect of what he does,[3] then by a\nconviction in a contrary direction he might have stopped in his course;\nbut now though he has had convictions he notwithstanding acts against\nthem.\nAgain, if any and every thing is the object-matter of Imperfect and\nPerfect Self-Control, who is the man of Imperfect Self-Control simply?\nbecause no one unites all cases of it, and we commonly say that some\nmen are so simply, not adding any particular thing in which they are\nso.\nWell, the difficulties raised are pretty near such as I have described\nthem, and of these theories we must remove some and leave others as\nestablished; because the solving of a difficulty is a positive act of\nestablishing something as true.\nChapter III.\nNow we must examine first whether men of Imperfect Self-Control act\nwith a knowledge of what is right or not: next, if with such knowledge,\nin what sense; and next what are we to assume is the object-matter of\nthe man of Imperfect Self-Control, and of the man of Self-Control; I\nmean, whether pleasure and pain of all kinds or certain definite ones;\nand as to Self-Control and Endurance, whether these are designations of\nthe same character or different. And in like manner we must go into all\nquestions which are connected with the present.\nBut the real starting point of the enquiry is, whether the two\ncharacters of Self-Control and Imperfect Self-Control are distinguished\nby their object-matter, or their respective relations to it. I mean,\nwhether the man of Imperfect Self-Control is such simply by virtue of\nhaving such and such object-matter; or not, but by virtue of his being\nrelated to it in such and such a way, or by virtue of both: next,\nwhether Self-Control and Imperfect Self-Control are unlimited in their\nobject-matter: because he who is designated without any addition a man\nof Imperfect Self-Control is not unlimited in his object-matter, but\nhas exactly the same as the man who has lost all Self-Control: nor is\nhe so designated because of his relation to this object-matter merely\n(for then his character would be identical with that just mentioned,\nloss of all Self-Control), but because of his relation to it being such\nand such. For the man who has lost all Self-Control is led on with\ndeliberate moral choice, holding that it is his line to pursue pleasure\nas it rises: while the man of Imperfect Self-Control does not think\nthat he ought to pursue it, but does pursue it all the same.\nNow as to the notion that it is True Opinion and not Knowledge in\ncontravention of which men fail in Self-Control, it makes no difference\nto the point in question, because some of those who hold Opinions have\nno doubt about them but suppose themselves to have accurate Knowledge;\nif then it is urged that men holding Opinions will be more likely than\nmen who have Knowledge to act in contravention of their conceptions, as\nhaving but a moderate belief in them; we reply, Knowledge will not\ndiffer in this respect from Opinion: because some men believe their own\nOpinions no less firmly than others do their positive Knowledge:\nHeraclitus is a case in point.\nRather the following is the account of it: the term _knowing_ has two\nsenses; both the man who does not use his Knowledge, and he who does,\nare said to _know_: there will be a difference between a man\u2019s acting\nwrongly, who though possessed of Knowledge does not call it into\noperation, and his doing so who has it and actually exercises it: the\nlatter is a strange case, but the mere having, if not exercising,\npresents no anomaly.\nAgain, as there are two kinds of propositions affecting action,[4]\nuniversal and particular, there is no reason why a man may not act\nagainst his Knowledge, having both propositions in his mind, using the\nuniversal but not the particular, for the particulars are the objects\nof moral action.\nThere is a difference also in universal propositions;[5] a universal\nproposition may relate partly to a man\u2019s self and partly to the thing\nin question: take the following for instance; \u201cdry food is good for\nevery man,\u201d this may have the two minor premisses, \u201cthis is a man,\u201d and\n\u201cso and so is dry food;\u201d but whether a given substance is so and so a\nman either has not the Knowledge or does not exert it. According to\nthese different senses there will be an immense difference, so that for\na man to _know_ in the one sense, and yet act wrongly, would be nothing\nstrange, but in any of the other senses it would be a matter for\nwonder.\nAgain, men may have Knowledge in a way different from any of those\nwhich have been now stated: for we constantly see a man\u2019s state so\ndiffering by having and not using Knowledge, that he has it in a sense\nand also has not; when a man is asleep, for instance, or mad, or drunk:\nwell, men under the actual operation of passion are in exactly similar\nconditions; for anger, lust, and some other such-like things,\nmanifestly make changes even in the body, and in some they even cause\nmadness; it is plain then that we must say the men of Imperfect\nSelf-Control are in a state similar to these.\nAnd their saying what embodies Knowledge is no proof of their actually\nthen exercising it, because they who are under the operation of these\npassions repeat demonstrations; or verses of Empedocles,[6] just as\nchildren, when first learning, string words together, but as yet know\nnothing of their meaning, because they must grow into it, and this is a\nprocess requiring time: so that we must suppose these men who fail in\nSelf-Control to say these moral sayings just as actors do.\nFurthermore, a man may look at the account of the ph\u00e6nomenon in the\nfollowing way, from an examination of the actual working of the mind:\nAll action may be analysed into a syllogism, in which the one premiss\nis an universal maxim and the other concerns particulars of which Sense\n[moral or physical, as the case may be] is cognisant: now when one\nresults from these two, it follows necessarily that, as far as theory\ngoes the mind must assert the conclusion, and in practical propositions\nthe man must act accordingly.\nFor instance, let the universal be, \u201cAll that is sweet should be\ntasted,\u201d the particular, \u201cThis is sweet;\u201d it follows necessarily that\nhe who is able and is not hindered should not only draw, but put in\npractice, the conclusion \u201cThis is to be tasted.\u201d When then there is in\nthe mind one universal proposition forbidding to taste, and the other\n\u201cAll that is sweet is pleasant\u201d with its minor \u201cThis is sweet\u201d (which\nis the one that really works), and desire happens to be in the man, the\nfirst universal bids him avoid this but the desire leads him on to\ntaste; for it has the power of moving the various organs: and so it\nresults that he fails in Self-Control, in a certain sense under the\ninfluence of Reason and Opinion not contrary in itself to Reason but\nonly accidentally so; because it is the desire that is contrary to\nRight Reason, but not the Opinion:[7] and so for this reason brutes are\nnot accounted of Imperfect Self-Control, because they have no power of\nconceiving universals but only of receiving and retaining particular\nimpressions.\nAs to the manner in which the ignorance is removed and the man of\nImperfect Self-Control recovers his Knowledge, the account is the same\nas with respect to him who is drunk or asleep, and is not peculiar to\nthis affection, so physiologists[8] are the right people to apply to.\nBut whereas the minor premiss of every practical syllogism is an\nopinion on matter cognisable by Sense and determines the actions; he\nwho is under the influence of passion either has not this, or so has it\nthat his having does not amount to _knowing_ but merely saying, as a\nman when drunk might repeat Empedocles\u2019 verses; and because the minor\nterm[9] is neither universal, nor is thought to have the power of\nproducing Knowledge in like manner as the universal term: and so the\nresult which Socrates was seeking comes out, that is to say, the\naffection does not take place in the presence of that which is thought\nto be specially and properly Knowledge, nor is this dragged about by\nreason of the affection, but in the presence of that Knowledge which is\nconveyed by Sense.\nLet this account then be accepted of the question respecting the\nfailure in Self-Control, whether it is with Knowledge, and the manner\nin which such failure is possible or not, though a man possesses\nKnowledge.\nChapter IV.\nThe next question to be discussed is whether there is a character to be\ndesignated by the term \u201cof Imperfect Self-Control\u201d simply, or whether\nall who are so are to be accounted such, in respect of some particular\nthing; and, if there is such a character, what is his object-matter.\nNow that pleasures and pains are the object-matter of men of\nSelf-Control and of Endurance, and also of men of Imperfect\nSelf-Control and Softness, is plain.\nFurther, things which produce pleasure are either necessary, or objects\nof choice in themselves but yet admitting of excess. All bodily things\nwhich produce pleasure are necessary; and I call such those which\nrelate to food and other grosser appetities, in short such bodily\nthings as we assumed were the Object-matter of absence of Self-Control\nand of Perfected Self-Mastery.\nThe other class of objects are not necessary, but objects of choice in\nthemselves: I mean, for instance, victory, honour, wealth, and\nsuch-like good or pleasant things. And those who are excessive in their\nliking for such things contrary to the principle of Right Reason which\nis in their own breasts we do not designate men of Imperfect\nSelf-Control simply, but with the addition of the thing wherein, as in\nrespect of money, or gain, or honour, or anger, and not simply; because\nwe consider them as different characters and only having that title in\nright of a kind of resemblance (as when we add to a man\u2019s name\n\u201cconqueror in the Olympic games\u201d the account of him as Man differs but\nlittle from the account of him as the Man who conquered in the Olympic\ngames, but still it is different). And a proof of the real difference\nbetween these so designated with an addition and those simply so called\nis this, that Imperfect Self-Control is blamed, not as an error merely\nbut also as being a vice, either wholly or partially; but none of these\nother cases is so blamed.\nBut of those who have for their object-matter the bodily enjoyments,\nwhich we say are also the object-matter of the man of Perfected\nSelf-Mastery and the man who has lost all Self-Control, he that pursues\nexcessive pleasures and too much avoids[10] things which are painful\n(as hunger and thirst, heat and cold, and everything connected with\ntouch and taste), not from moral choice but in spite of his moral\nchoice and intellectual conviction, is termed \u201ca man of Imperfect\nSelf-Control,\u201d not with the addition of any particular object-matter as\nwe do in respect of want of control of anger but simply.\nAnd a proof that the term is thus applied is that the kindred term\n\u201cSoft\u201d is used in respect of these enjoyments but not in respect of any\nof those others. And for this reason we put into the same rank the man\nof Imperfect Self-Control, the man who has lost it entirely, the man\nwho has it, and the man of Perfected Self-Mastery; but not any of those\nother characters, because the former have for their object-matter the\nsame pleasures and pains: but though they have the same object-matter,\nthey are not related to it in the same way, but two of them act upon\nmoral choice, two without it. And so we should say that man is more\nentirely given up to his passions who pursues excessive pleasures, and\navoids moderate pains, being either not at all, or at least but little,\nurged by desire, than the man who does so because his desire is very\nstrong: because we think what would the former be likely to do if he\nhad the additional stimulus of youthful lust and violent pain\nconsequent on the want of those pleasures which we have denominated\nnecessary?\nWell then, since of desires and pleasures there are some which are in\nkind honourable and good (because things pleasant are divisible, as we\nsaid before, into such as are naturally objects of choice, such as are\nnaturally objects of avoidance, and such as are in themselves\nindifferent, money, gain, honour, victory, for instance); in respect of\nall such and those that are indifferent, men are blamed not merely[11]\nfor being affected by or desiring or liking them, but for exceeding in\nany way in these feelings.\nAnd so they are blamed, whosoever in spite of Reason are mastered by,\nthat is pursue, any object, though in its nature noble and good; they,\nfor instance, who are more earnest than they should be respecting\nhonour, or their children or parents; not but what these are good\nobjects and men are praised for being earnest about them: but still\nthey admit of excess; for instance, if any one, as Niobe did, should\nfight even against the gods, or feel towards his father as Satyrus, who\ngot therefrom the nickname of \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1, because he was thought to be\nvery foolish.\nNow depravity there is none in regard of these things, for the reason\nassigned above, that each of them in itself is a thing naturally\nchoice-worthy, yet the excesses in respect of them are wrong and matter\nfor blame: and similarly there is no Imperfect Self-Control in respect\nof these things; that being not merely a thing that should be avoided\nbut blameworthy.\nBut because of the resemblance of the affection to the Imperfection of\nSelf-Control the term is used with the addition in each case of the\nparticular object-matter, just as men call a man a bad physician, or\nbad actor, whom they would not think of calling simply bad. As then in\nthese cases we do not apply the term simply because each of the states\nis not a vice, but only like a vice in the way of analogy,[12] so it is\nplain that in respect of Imperfect Self-Control and Self-Control we\nmust limit the names to those states which have the same object-matter\nas Perfected Self-Mastery and utter loss of Self-Control, and that we\ndo apply it to the case of anger only in the way of resemblance: for\nwhich reason, with an addition, we designate a man of Imperfect\nSelf-Control in respect of anger, as of honour or of gain.\nChapter V.\nAs there are some things naturally pleasant, and of these two kinds;\nthose, namely, which are pleasant generally, and those which are so\nrelatively to particular kinds of animals and men; so there are others\nwhich are not naturally pleasant but which come to be so in consequence\neither of maimings, or custom, or depraved natural tastes: and one may\nobserve moral states similar to those we have been speaking of, having\nrespectively these classes of things for their object-matter.\nI mean the Brutish, as in the case of the female who, they say, would\nrip up women with child and eat the foetus; or the tastes which are\nfound among the savage tribes bordering on the Pontus, some liking raw\nflesh, and some being cannibals, and some lending one another their\nchildren to make feasts of; or what is said of Phalaris. These are\ninstances of Brutish states, caused in some by disease or madness;\ntake, for instance, the man who sacrificed and ate his mother, or him\nwho devoured the liver of his fellow-servant. Instances again of those\ncaused by disease or by custom, would be, plucking out of hair, or\neating one\u2019s nails, or eating coals and earth.[13] Now wherever nature\nis really the cause no one would think of calling men of Imperfect\nSelf-Control, ... nor, in like manner, such as are in a diseased state\nthrough custom.\nThe having any of these inclinations is something foreign to what is\ndenominated Vice, just as Brutishness is: and when a man has them his\nmastering them is not properly Self-Control, nor his being mastered by\nthem Imperfection of Self-Control in the proper sense, but only in the\nway of resemblance; just as we may say a man of ungovernable wrath\nfails of Self-Control in respect of anger but not simply fails of\nSelf-Control. For all excessive folly, cowardice, absence of\nSelf-Control, or irritability, are either Brutish or morbid. The man,\nfor instance, who is naturally afraid of all things, even if a mouse\nshould stir, is cowardly after a Brutish sort; there was a man again\nwho, by reason of disease, was afraid of a cat: and of the fools, they\nwho are naturally destitute of Reason and live only by Sense are\nBrutish, as are some tribes of the far-off barbarians, while others who\nare so by reason of diseases, epileptic or frantic, are in morbid\nstates.\nSo then, of these inclinations, a man may sometimes merely have one\nwithout yielding to it: I mean, suppose that Phalaris had restrained\nhis unnatural desire to eat a child: or he may both have and yield to\nit. As then Vice when such as belongs to human nature is called Vice\nsimply, while the other is so called with the addition of \u201cbrutish\u201d or\n\u201cmorbid,\u201d but not simply Vice, so manifestly there is Brutish and\nMorbid Imperfection of Self-Control, but that alone is entitled to the\nname without any qualification which is of the nature of utter absence\nof Self-Control, as it is found in Man.\nChapter VI.\nIt is plain then that the object-matter of Imperfect Self-Control and\nSelf-Control is restricted to the same as that of utter absence of\nSelf-Control and that of Perfected Self-Mastery, and that the rest is\nthe object-matter of a different species so named metaphorically and\nnot simply: we will now examine the position, \u201cthat Imperfect\nSelf-Control in respect of Anger is less disgraceful than that in\nrespect of Lusts.\u201d\nIn the first place, it seems that Anger does in a way listen to Reason\nbut mishears it; as quick servants who run out before they have heard\nthe whole of what is said and then mistake the order; dogs, again, bark\nat the slightest stir, before they have seen whether it be friend or\nfoe; just so Anger, by reason of its natural heat and quickness,\nlistening to Reason, but without having heard the command of Reason,\nrushes to its revenge. That is to say, Reason or some impression on the\nmind shows there is insolence or contempt[14] in the offender, and then\nAnger, reasoning as it were that one ought to fight against what is\nsuch, fires up immediately: whereas Lust, if Reason or Sense, as the\ncase may be, merely says a thing is sweet, rushes to the enjoyment of\nit: and so Anger follows Reason in a manner, but Lust does not and is\ntherefore more disgraceful: because he that cannot control his anger\nyields in a manner to Reason, but the other to his Lust and not to\nReason at all.\nAgain, a man is more excusable for following such desires as are\nnatural, just as he is for following such Lusts as are common to all\nand to that degree in which they are common. Now Anger and irritability\nare more natural than Lusts when in excess and for objects not\nnecessary. (This was the ground of the defence the man made who beat\nhis father, \u201cMy father,\u201d he said, \u201cused to beat his, and his father his\nagain, and this little fellow here,\u201d pointing to his child, \u201cwill beat\nme when he is grown a man: it runs in the family.\u201d And the father, as\nhe was being dragged along, bid his son leave off beating him at the\ndoor, because he had himself been used to drag his father so far and no\nfarther.)\nAgain, characters are less unjust in proportion as they involve less\ninsidiousness. Now the Angry man is not insidious, nor is Anger, but\nquite open: but Lust is: as they say of Venus,\n\u201cCyprus-born Goddess, _weaver of deceits_\u201d\nOr Homer of the girdle called the Cestus,\n\u201cPersuasiveness _cheating_ e\u2019en the subtlest mind.\u201d\nAnd so since this kind of Imperfect Self-Control is more unjust, it is\nalso more disgraceful than that in respect of Anger, and is simply\nImperfect Self-Control, and Vice in a certain sense.\nAgain, no man feels pain in being insolent, but every one who acts\nthrough Anger does act with pain; and he who acts insolently does it\nwith pleasure. If then those things are most unjust with which we have\nmost right to be angry, then Imperfect Self-Control, arising from Lust,\nis more so than that arising from Anger: because in Anger there is no\ninsolence.[15]\nWell then, it is clear that Imperfect Self-Control in respect of Lusts\nis more disgraceful than that in respect of Anger, and that the\nobject-matter of Self-Control, and the Imperfection of it, are bodily\nLusts and pleasures; but of these last we must take into account the\ndifferences; for, as was said at the commencement, some are proper to\nthe human race and natural both in kind and degree, others Brutish, and\nothers caused by maimings and diseases.\nNow the first of these only are the object-matter of Perfected\nSelf-Mastery and utter absence of Self-Control; and therefore we never\nattribute either of these states to Brutes (except metaphorically, and\nwhenever any one kind of animal differs entirely from another in\ninsolence, mischievousness, or voracity), because they have not moral\nchoice or process of deliberation, but are quite different from that\nkind of creature just as are madmen from other men.\nBrutishness is not so low in the scale as Vice, yet it is to be\nregarded with more fear: because it is not that the highest principle\nhas been corrupted, as in the human creature, but the subject has it\nnot at all.\nIt is much the same, therefore, as if one should compare an inanimate\nwith an animate being, which were the worse: for the badness of that\nwhich has no principle of origination is always less harmful; now\nIntellect is a principle of origination. A similar case would be the\ncomparing injustice and an unjust man together: for in different ways\neach is the worst: a bad man would produce ten thousand times as much\nharm as a bad brute.\nChapter VII.\nNow with respect to the pleasures and pains which come to a man through\nTouch and Taste, and the desiring or avoiding such (which we determined\nbefore to constitute the object-matter of the states of utter absence\nof Self-Control and Perfected Self-Mastery), one may be so disposed as\nto yield to temptations to which most men would be superior, or to be\nsuperior to those to which most men would yield: in respect of\npleasures, these characters will be respectively the man of Imperfect\nSelf-Control, and the man of Self-Control; and, in respect of pains,\nthe man of Softness and the man of Endurance: but the moral state of\nmost men is something between the two, even though they lean somewhat\nto the worse characters.\nAgain, since of the pleasures indicated some are necessary and some are\nnot, others are so to a certain degree but not the excess or defect of\nthem, and similarly also of Lusts and pains, the man who pursues the\nexcess of pleasant things, or such as are in themselves excess, or from\nmoral choice, for their own sake, and not for anything else which is to\nresult from them, is a man utterly void of Self-Control: for he must be\nincapable of remorse, and so incurable, because he that has not remorse\nis incurable. (He that has too little love of pleasure is the opposite\ncharacter, and the man of Perfected Self-Mastery the mean character.)\nHe is of a similar character who avoids the bodily pains, not because\nhe _cannot_, but because he _chooses not to_, withstand them.\nBut of the characters who go wrong without _choosing_ so to do, the one\nis led on by reason of pleasure, the other because he avoids the pain\nit would cost him to deny his lust; and so they are different the one\nfrom the other. Now every one would pronounce a man worse for doing\nsomething base without any impulse of desire, or with a very slight\none, than for doing the same from the impulse of a very strong desire;\nfor striking a man when not angry than if he did so in wrath: because\none naturally says, \u201cWhat would he have done had he been under the\ninfluence of passion?\u201d (and on this ground, by the bye, the man utterly\nvoid of Self-Control is worse than he who has it imperfectly). However,\nof the two characters which have been mentioned,[16] [as included in\nthat of utter absence of Self-Control], the one is rather Softness, the\nother properly the man of no Self-Control.\nFurthermore, to the character of Imperfect Self-Control is opposed that\nof Self-Control, and to that of Softness that of Endurance: because\nEndurance consists in continued resistance but Self-Control in actual\nmastery, and continued resistance and actual mastery are as different\nas not being conquered is from conquering; and so Self-Control is more\nchoice-worthy than Endurance.\nAgain, he who fails when exposed to those temptations against which the\ncommon run of men hold out, and are well able to do so, is Soft and\nLuxurious (Luxury being a kind of Softness): the kind of man, I mean,\nto let his robe drag in the dirt to avoid the trouble of lifting it,\nand who, aping the sick man, does not however suppose himself wretched\nthough he is like a wretched man. So it is too with respect to\nSelf-Control and the Imperfection of it: if a man yields to pleasures\nor pains which are violent and excessive it is no matter for wonder,\nbut rather for allowance if he made what resistance he could (instances\nare, Philoctetes in Theodectes\u2019 drama when wounded by the viper; or\nCercyon in the Alope of Carcinus, or men who in trying to suppress\nlaughter burst into a loud continuous fit of it, as happened, you\nremember, to Xenophantus), but it is a matter for wonder when a man\nyields to and cannot contend against those pleasures or pains which the\ncommon herd are able to resist; always supposing his failure not to be\nowing to natural constitution or disease, I mean, as the Scythian kings\nare constitutionally Soft, or the natural difference between the sexes.\nAgain, the man who is a slave to amusement is commonly thought to be\ndestitute of Self-Control, but he really is Soft; because amusement is\nan act of relaxing, being an act of resting, and the character in\nquestion is one of those who exceed due bounds in respect of this.\nMoreover of Imperfect Self-Control there are two forms, Precipitancy\nand Weakness: those who have it in the latter form though they have\nmade resolutions do not abide by them by reason of passion; the others\nare led by passion because they have never formed any resolutions at\nall: while there are some who, like those who by tickling themselves\nbeforehand get rid of ticklishness, having felt and seen beforehand the\napproach of temptation, and roused up themselves and their resolution,\nyield not to passion; whether the temptation be somewhat pleasant or\nsomewhat painful. The Precipitate form of Imperfect Self-Control they\nare most liable to who are constitutionally of a sharp or melancholy\ntemperament: because the one by reason of the swiftness, the other by\nreason of the violence, of their passions, do not wait for Reason,\nbecause they are disposed to follow whatever notion is impressed upon\ntheir minds.\nAgain, the man utterly destitute of Self-Control, as was observed\nbefore, is not given to remorse: for it is part of his character that\nhe abides by his moral choice: but the man of Imperfect Self-Control is\nalmost made up of remorse: and so the case is not as we determined it\nbefore, but the former is incurable and the latter may be cured: for\ndepravity is like chronic diseases, dropsy and consumption for\ninstance, but Imperfect Self-Control is like acute disorders: the\nformer being a continuous evil, the latter not so. And, in fact,\nImperfect Self-Control and Confirmed Vice are different in kind: the\nlatter being imperceptible to its victim, the former not so.[17]\nBut, of the different forms of Imperfect Self-Control, those are better\nwho are carried off their feet by a sudden access of temptation than\nthey who have Reason but do not abide by it; these last being overcome\nby passion less in degree, and not wholly without premeditation as are\nthe others: for the man of Imperfect Self-Control is like those who are\nsoon intoxicated and by little wine and less than the common run of\nmen.\nWell then, that Imperfection of Self-Control is not Confirmed\nViciousness is plain: and yet perhaps it is such in a way, because in\none sense it is contrary to moral choice and in another the result of\nit:[18] at all events, in respect of the actions, the case is much like\nwhat Demodocus said of the Miletians. \u201cThe people of Miletus are not\nfools, but they do just the kind of things that fools do;\u201d and so they\nof Imperfect Self-Control are not unjust, but they do unjust acts.\nBut to resume. Since the man of Imperfect Self-Control is of such a\ncharacter as to follow bodily pleasures in excess and in defiance of\nRight Reason, without acting on any deliberate conviction, whereas the\nman utterly destitute of Self-Control does act upon a conviction which\nrests on his natural inclination to follow after these pleasures; the\nformer may be easily persuaded to a different course, but the latter\nnot: for Virtue and Vice respectively preserve and corrupt the moral\nprinciple; now the motive is the principle or starting point in moral\nactions, just as axioms and postulates are in mathematics: and neither\nin morals nor mathematics is it Reason which is apt to teach the\nprinciple; but Excellence, either natural or acquired by custom, in\nholding right notions with respect to the principle. He who does this\nin morals is the man of Perfected Self-Mastery, and the contrary\ncharacter is the man utterly destitute of Self-Control.\nAgain, there is a character liable to be taken off his feet in defiance\nof Right Reason because of passion; whom passion so far masters as to\nprevent his acting in accordance with Right Reason, but not so far as\nto make him be convinced that it is his proper line to follow after\nsuch pleasures without limit: this character is the man of Imperfect\nSelf- Control, better than he who is utterly destitute of it, and not a\nbad man simply and without qualification: because in him the highest\nand best part, i.e. principle, is preserved: and there is another\ncharacter opposed to him who is apt to abide by his resolutions, and\nnot to depart from them; at all events, not at the instigation of\npassion.\nIt is evident then from all this, that Self-Control is a good state and\nthe Imperfection of it a bad one.\nChapter VIII.\nNext comes the question, whether a man is a man of Self-Control for\nabiding by his conclusions and moral choice be they of what kind they\nmay, or only by the right one; or again, a man of Imperfect\nSelf-Control for not abiding by his conclusions and moral choice be\nthey of whatever kind; or, to put the case we did before, is he such\nfor not abiding by false conclusions and wrong moral choice?\nIs not this the truth, that _incidentally_ it is by conclusions and\nmoral choice of any kind that the one character abides and the other\ndoes not, but _per se_ true conclusions and right moral choice:[19] to\nexplain what is meant by incidentally, and _per se_; suppose a man\nchooses or pursues this thing for the sake of that, he is said to\npursue and choose that _per se_, but this only incidentally. For the\nterm _per se_ we use commonly the word \u201csimply,\u201d and so, in a way, it\nis opinion of any kind soever by which the two characters respectively\nabide or not, but he is \u201csimply\u201d entitled to the designations who\nabides or not by the true opinion.\nThere are also people, who have a trick of abiding by their, own\nopinions, who are commonly called Positive, as they who are hard to be\npersuaded, and whose convictions are not easily changed: now these\npeople bear some resemblance to the character of Self-Control, just as\nthe prodigal to the liberal or the rash man to the brave, but they are\ndifferent in many points. The man of Self-Control does not change by\nreason of passion and lust, yet when occasion so requires he will be\neasy of persuasion: but the Positive man changes not at the call of\nReason, though many of this class take up certain desires and are led\nby their pleasures. Among the class of Positive are the Opinionated,\nthe Ignorant, and the Bearish: the first, from the motives of pleasure\nand pain: I mean, they have the pleasurable feeling of a kind of\nvictory in not having their convictions changed, and they are pained\nwhen their decrees, so to speak, are reversed: so that, in fact, they\nrather resemble the man of Imperfect Self-Control than the man of\nSelf-Control.\nAgain, there are some who depart from their resolutions not by reason\nof any Imperfection of Self-Control; take, for instance, Neoptolemus in\nthe Philoctetes of Sophocles. Here certainly pleasure was the motive of\nhis departure from his resolution, but then it was one of a noble sort:\nfor to be truthful was noble in his eyes and he had been persuaded by\nUlysses to lie.\nSo it is not every one who acts from the motive of pleasure who is\nutterly destitute of Self-Control or base or of Imperfect Self-Control,\nonly he who acts from the impulse of a base pleasure.\nChapter IX.\nMoreover as there is a character who takes less pleasure than he ought\nin bodily enjoyments, and he also fails to abide by the conclusion of\nhis Reason,[20] the man of Self-Control is the mean between him and the\nman of Imperfect Self-Control: that is to say, the latter fails to\nabide by them because of somewhat too much, the former because of\nsomewhat too little; while the man of Self-Control abides by them, and\nnever changes by reason of anything else than such conclusions.\nNow of course since Self-Control is good both the contrary States must\nbe bad, as indeed they plainly are: but because the one of them is seen\nin few persons, and but rarely in them, Self-Control comes to be viewed\nas if opposed only to the Imperfection of it, just as Perfected\nSelf-Mastery is thought to be opposed only to utter want of\nSelf-Control.\nAgain, as many terms are used in the way of similitude, so people have\ncome to talk of the Self-Control of the man of Perfected Self-Mastery\nin the way of similitude: for the man of Self-Control and the man of\nPerfected Self-Mastery have this in common, that they do nothing\nagainst Right Reason on the impulse of bodily pleasures, but then the\nformer has bad desires, the latter not; and the latter is so\nconstituted as not even to feel pleasure contrary to his Reason, the\nformer feels but does not yield to it.\nLike again are the man of Imperfect Self-Control and he who is utterly\ndestitute of it, though in reality distinct: both follow bodily\npleasures, but the latter under a notion that it is the proper line for\nhim to take, his former without any such notion.\nAnd it is not possible for the same man to be at once a man of\nPractical Wisdom and of Imperfect Self-Control: because the character\nof Practical Wisdom includes, as we showed before, goodness of moral\ncharacter. And again, it is not knowledge merely, but aptitude for\naction, which constitutes Practical Wisdom: and of this aptitude the\nman of Imperfect Self-Control is destitute. But there is no reason why\nthe Clever man should not be of Imperfect Self-Control: and the reason\nwhy some men are occasionally thought to be men of Practical Wisdom,\nand yet of Imperfect Self-Control, is this, that Cleverness differs\nfrom Practical Wisdom in the way I stated in a former book, and is very\nnear it so far as the intellectual element is concerned but differs in\nrespect of the moral choice.\nNor is the man of Imperfect Self-Control like the man who both has and\ncalls into exercise his knowledge, but like the man who, having it, is\noverpowered by sleep or wine. Again, he acts voluntarily (because he\nknows, in a certain sense, what he does and the result of it), but he\nis not a confirmed bad man, for his moral choice is good, so he is at\nall events only half bad. Nor is he unjust, because he does not act\nwith deliberate intent: for of the two chief forms of the character,\nthe one is not apt to abide by his deliberate resolutions, and the\nother, the man of constitutional strength of passion, is not apt to\ndeliberate at all.\nSo in fact the man of Imperfect Self-Control is like a community which\nmakes all proper enactments, and has admirable laws, only does not act\non them, verifying the scoff of Anaxandrides,\n\u201cThat State did will it, which cares nought for laws;\u201d\nwhereas the bad man is like one which acts upon its laws, but then\nunfortunately they are bad ones.\nImperfection of Self-Control and Self-Control, after all, are above the\naverage state of men; because he of the latter character is more true\nto his Reason, and the former less so, than is in the power of most\nmen.\nAgain, of the two forms of Imperfect Self-Control that is more easily\ncured which they have who are constitutionally of strong passions, than\nthat of those who form resolutions and break them; and they that are so\nthrough habituation than they that are so naturally; since of course\ncustom is easier to change than nature, because the very resemblance of\ncustom to nature is what constitutes the difficulty of changing it; as\nEvenus says,\n\u201cPractice, I say, my friend, doth long endure,\nAnd at the last is even very nature.\u201d\nWe have now said then what Self-Control is, what Imperfection of\nSelf-Control, what Endurance, and what Softness, and how these states\nare mutually related.\nAPPENDIX.\nBook VII. Chapters 12 to 15. (Bekker.)\nTo consider the subject of Pleasure and Pain falls within the province\nof the Social-Science Philosopher, since he it is who has to fix the\nMaster-End which is to guide us in dominating any object absolutely\nevil or good.\nBut we may say more: an enquiry into their nature is absolutely\nnecessary. First, because we maintained that Moral Virtue and Moral\nVice are both concerned with Pains and Pleasures: next, because the\ngreater part of mankind assert that Happiness must include Pleasure\n(which by the way accounts for the word they use, \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\nbeing the root of that word).\nNow some hold that no one Pleasure is good, either in itself or as a\nmatter of result, because Good and Pleasure are not identical. Others\nthat some Pleasures are good but the greater number bad. There is yet a\nthird view; granting that every Pleasure is good, still the Chief Good\ncannot possibly be Pleasure.\nIn support of the first opinion (that Pleasure is utterly not-good) it\nis urged that:\n1. Every Pleasure is a sensible process towards a complete state; but\nno such process is akin to the end to be attained: _e.g._ no process of\nbuilding to the completed house.\n2. The man of Perfected Self-Mastery avoids Pleasures.\n3. The man of Practical Wisdom aims at avoiding Pain, not at attaining\nPleasure.\n4. Pleasures are an impediment to thought, and the more so the more\nkeenly they are felt. An obvious instance will readily occur.\n5. Pleasure cannot be referred to any Art: and yet every good is the\nresult of some Art.\n6. Children and brutes pursue Pleasures.\nIn support of the second (that not all Pleasures are good), That there\nare some base and matter of reproach, and some even hurtful: because\nsome things that are pleasant produce disease.\nIn support of the third (that Pleasure is not the Chief Good), That it\nis not an End but a process towards creating an End.\nThis is, I think, a fair account of current views on the matter.\nBut that the reasons alleged do not prove it either to be not-good or\nthe Chief Good is plain from the following considerations.\nFirst. Good being either absolute or relative, of course the natures\nand states embodying it will be so too; therefore also the movements\nand the processes of creation. So, of those which are thought to be bad\nsome will be bad absolutely, but relatively not bad, perhaps even\nchoice-worthy; some not even choice-worthy relatively to any particular\nperson, only at certain times or for a short time but not in themselves\nchoice-worthy.\nOthers again are not even Pleasures at all though they produce that\nimpression on the mind: all such I mean as imply pain and whose purpose\nis cure; those of sick people, for instance.\nNext, since Good may be either an active working or a state, those\n[\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 or \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2] which tend to place us in our natural state are\npleasant incidentally because of that tendency: but the active working\nis really in the desires excited in the remaining (sound) part of our\nstate or nature: for there are Pleasures which have no connection with\npain or desire: the acts of contemplative intellect, for instance, in\nwhich case there is no deficiency in the nature or state of him who\nperforms the acts.\nA proof of this is that the same pleasant thing does not produce the\nsensation of Pleasure when the natural state is being filled up or\ncompleted as when it is already in its normal condition: in this latter\ncase what give the sensation are things pleasant _per se_, in the\nformer even those things which are contrary. I mean, you find people\ntaking pleasure in sharp or bitter things of which no one is naturally\nor in itself pleasant; of course not therefore the Pleasures arising\nfrom them, because it is obvious that as is the classification of\npleasant things such must be that of the Pleasures arising from them.\nNext, it does not follow that there must be something else better than\nany given pleasure because (as some say) the End must be better than\nthe process which creates it. For it is not true that all Pleasures are\nprocesses or even attended by any process, but (some are) active\nworkings or even Ends: in fact they result not from our coming to be\nsomething but from our using our powers. Again, it is not true that the\nEnd is, in every case, distinct from the process: it is true only in\nthe case of such processes as conduce to the perfecting of the natural\nstate.\nFor which reason it is wrong to say that Pleasure is \u201ca sensible\nprocess of production.\u201d For \u201cprocess etc.\u201d should be substituted\n\u201cactive working of the natural state,\u201d for \u201csensible\u201d \u201cunimpeded.\u201d The\nreason of its being thought to be a \u201cprocess etc.\u201d is that it is good\nin the highest sense: people confusing \u201cactive working\u201d and \u201cprocess,\u201d\nwhereas they really are distinct.\nNext, as to the argument that there are bad Pleasures because some\nthings which are pleasant are also hurtful to health, it is the same as\nsaying that some healthful things are bad for \u201cbusiness.\u201d In this\nsense, of course, both may be said to be bad, but then this does not\nmake them out to be bad _simpliciter_: the exercise of the pure\nIntellect sometimes hurts a man\u2019s health: but what hinders Practical\nWisdom or any state whatever is, not the Pleasure peculiar to, but some\nPleasure foreign to it: the Pleasures arising from the exercise of the\npure Intellect or from learning only promote each.\nNext. \u201cNo Pleasure is the work of any Art.\u201d What else would you expect?\nNo active working is the work of any Art, only the faculty of so\nworking. Still the perfumer\u2019s Art or the cook\u2019s are thought to belong\nto Pleasure.\nNext. \u201cThe man of Perfected Self-Mastery avoids Pleasures.\u201d \u201cThe man of\nPractical Wisdom aims at escaping Pain rather than at attaining\nPleasure.\u201d\n\u201cChildren and brutes pursue Pleasures.\u201d\nOne answer will do for all.\nWe have already said in what sense all Pleasures are good _per se_ and\nin what sense not all are good: it is the latter class that brutes and\nchildren pursue, such as are accompanied by desire and pain, that is\nthe bodily Pleasures (which answer to this description) and the\nexcesses of them: in short, those in respect of which the man utterly\ndestitute of Self-Control is thus utterly destitute. And it is the\nabsence of the pain arising from these Pleasures that the man of\nPractical Wisdom aims at. It follows that these Pleasures are what the\nman of Perfected Self-Mastery avoids: for obviously he has Pleasures\npeculiarly his own.\nThen again, it is allowed that Pain is an evil and a thing to be\navoided partly as bad _per se_, partly as being a hindrance in some\nparticular way. Now the contrary of that which is to be avoided, _qu\u00e2_\nit is to be avoided, _i.e._ evil, is good. Pleasure then must be _a_\ngood.\nThe attempted answer of Speusippus, \u201cthat Pleasure may be opposed and\nyet not contrary to Pain, just as the greater portion of any magnitude\nis contrary to the less but only opposed to the exact half,\u201d will not\nhold: for he cannot say that Pleasure is identical with evil of any\nkind.\nAgain. Granting that some Pleasures are low, there is no reason why\nsome particular Pleasure may not be very good, just as some particular\nScience may be although there are some which are low.\nPerhaps it even follows, since each state may have active working\nunimpeded, whether the active workings of all be Happiness or that of\nsome one of them, that this active working, if it be unimpeded, must be\nchoice-worthy: now Pleasure is exactly this. So that the Chief Good may\nbe Pleasure of some kind, though most Pleasures be (let us assume) low\n_per se_.\nAnd for this reason all men think the happy life is pleasant, and\ninterweave Pleasure with Happiness. Reasonably enough: because\nHappiness is perfect, but no impeded active working is perfect; and\ntherefore the happy man needs as an addition the goods of the body and\nthe goods external and fortune that in these points he may not be\nfettered. As for those who say that he who is being tortured on the\nwheel, or falls into great misfortunes is happy provided only he be\ngood, they talk nonsense, whether they mean to do so or not. On the\nother hand, because fortune is needed as an addition, some hold good\nfortune to be identical with Happiness: which it is not, for even this\nin excess is a hindrance, and perhaps then has no right to be called\ngood fortune since it is good only in so far as it contributes to\nHappiness.\nThe fact that all animals, brute and human alike, pursue Pleasure, is\nsome presumption of its being in a sense the Chief Good;\n(\u201cThere must be something in what most folks say,\u201d) only as one and the\nsame nature or state neither is nor is thought to be the best, so\nneither do all pursue the same Pleasure, Pleasure nevertheless all do.\nNay further, what they pursue is, perhaps, not what they think nor what\nthey would say they pursue, but really one and the same: for in all\nthere is some instinct above themselves. But the bodily Pleasures have\nreceived the name exclusively, because theirs is the most frequent form\nand that which is universally partaken of; and so, because to many\nthese alone are known they believe them to be the only ones which\nexist.\nIt is plain too that, unless Pleasure and its active working be good,\nit will not be true that the happy man\u2019s life embodies Pleasure: for\nwhy will he want it on the supposition that it is not good and that he\ncan live even with Pain? because, assuming that Pleasure is not good,\nthen Pain is neither evil nor good, and so why should he avoid it?\nBesides, the life of the good man is not more pleasurable than any\nother unless it be granted that his active workings are so too.\nSome enquiry into the bodily Pleasures is also necessary for those who\nsay that some Pleasures, to be sure, are highly choice-worthy (the good\nones to wit), but not the bodily Pleasures; that is, those which are\nthe object-matter of the man utterly destitute of Self-Control.\nIf so, we ask, why are the contrary Pains bad? they cannot be (on their\nassumption) because the contrary of bad is good.\nMay we not say that the necessary bodily Pleasures are good in the\nsense in which that which is not-bad is good? or that they are good\nonly up to a certain point? because such states or movements as cannot\nhave too much of the better cannot have too much of Pleasure, but those\nwhich can of the former can also of the latter. Now the bodily\nPleasures do admit of excess: in fact the low bad man is such because\nhe pursues the excess of them instead of those which are necessary\n(meat, drink, and the objects of other animal appetites do give\npleasure to all, but not in right manner or degree to all). But his\nrelation to Pain is exactly the contrary: it is not excessive Pain, but\nPain at all, that he avoids [which makes him to be in this way too a\nbad low man], because only in the case of him who pursues excessive\nPleasure is Pain contrary to excessive Pleasure.\nIt is not enough however merely to state the truth, we should also show\nhow the false view arises; because this strengthens conviction. I mean,\nwhen we have given a probable reason why that impresses people as true\nwhich really is not true, it gives them a stronger conviction of the\ntruth. And so we must now explain why the bodily Pleasures appear to\npeople to be more choice-worthy than any others.\nThe first obvious reason is, that bodily Pleasure drives out Pain; and\nbecause Pain is felt in excess men pursue Pleasure in excess, _i.e._\ngenerally bodily Pleasure, under the notion of its being a remedy for\nthat Pain. These remedies, moreover, come to be violent ones; which is\nthe very reason they are pursued, since the impression they produce on\nthe mind is owing to their being looked at side by side with their\ncontrary.\nAnd, as has been said before, there are the two following reasons why\nbodily Pleasure is thought to be not-good.\n1. Some Pleasures of this class are actings of a low nature, whether\ncongenital as in brutes, or acquired by custom as in low bad men.\n2. Others are in the nature of cures, cures that is of some deficiency;\nnow of course it is better to have [the healthy state] originally than\nthat it should accrue afterwards.\n(But some Pleasures result when natural states are being perfected:\nthese therefore are good as a matter of result.)\nAgain, the very fact of their being violent causes them to be pursued\nby such as can relish no others: such men in fact create violent\nthirsts for themselves (if harmless ones then we find no fault, if\nharmful then it is bad and low) because they have no other things to\ntake pleasure in, and the neutral state is distasteful to some people\nconstitutionally; for toil of some kind is inseparable from life, as\nphysiologists testify, telling us that the acts of seeing or hearing\nare painful, only that we are used to the pain and do not find it out.\nSimilarly in youth the constant growth produces a state much like that\nof vinous intoxication, and youth is pleasant. Again, men of the\nmelancholic temperament constantly need some remedial process (because\nthe body, from its temperament, is constantly being worried), and they\nare in a chronic state of violent desire. But Pleasure drives out Pain;\nnot only such Pleasure as is directly contrary to Pain but even any\nPleasure provided it be strong: and this is how men come to be utterly\ndestitute of Self-Mastery, _i.e._ low and bad.\nBut those Pleasures which are unconnected with Pains do not admit of\nexcess: _i.e._ such as belong to objects which are naturally pleasant\nand not merely as a matter of result: by the latter class I mean such\nas are remedial, and the reason why these are thought to be pleasant is\nthat the cure results from the action in some way of that part of the\nconstitution which remains sound. By \u201cpleasant naturally\u201d I mean such\nas put into action a nature which is pleasant.\nThe reason why no one and the same thing is invariably pleasant is that\nour nature is, not simple, but complex, involving something different\nfrom itself (so far as we are corruptible beings). Suppose then that\none part of this nature be doing something, this something is, to the\nother part, unnatural: but, if there be an equilibrium of the two\nnatures, then whatever is being done is indifferent. It is obvious that\nif there be any whose nature is simple and not complex, to such a being\nthe same course of acting will always be the most pleasurable.\nFor this reason it is that the Divinity feels Pleasure which is always\none, _i.e._ simple: not motion merely but also motionlessness acts, and\nPleasure resides rather in the absence than in the presence of motion.\nThe reason why the Poet\u2019s dictum \u201cchange is of all things most\npleasant\u201d is true, is \u201ca baseness in our blood;\u201d for as the bad man is\neasily changeable, bad must be also the nature that craves change,\n_i.e._ it is neither simple nor good.\nWe have now said our say about Self-Control and its opposite; and about\nPleasure and Pain. What each is, and how the one set is good the other\nbad. We have yet to speak of Friendship.\nBOOK VIII\nChapter I.\nNext would seem properly to follow a dissertation on Friendship:\nbecause, in the first place, it is either itself a virtue or connected\nwith virtue; and next it is a thing most necessary for life, since no\none would choose to live without friends though he should have all the\nother good things in the world: and, in fact, men who are rich or\npossessed of authority and influence are thought to have special need\nof friends: for where is the use of such prosperity if there be taken\naway the doing of kindnesses of which friends are the most usual and\nmost commendable objects? Or how can it be kept or preserved without\nfriends? because the greater it is so much the more slippery and\nhazardous: in poverty moreover and all other adversities men think\nfriends to be their only refuge.\nFurthermore, Friendship helps the young to keep from error: the old, in\nrespect of attention and such deficiencies in action as their weakness\nmakes them liable to; and those who are in their prime, in respect of\nnoble deeds (\u201cThey _two_ together going,\u201d Homer says, you may\nremember), because they are thus more able to devise plans and carry\nthem out.\nAgain, it seems to be implanted in us by Nature: as, for instance, in\nthe parent towards the offspring and the offspring towards the parent\n(not merely in the human species, but likewise in birds and most\nanimals), and in those of the same tribe towards one another, and\nspecially in men of the same nation; for which reason we commend those\nmen who love their fellows: and one may see in the course of travel how\nclose of kin and how friendly man is to man.\nFurthermore, Friendship seems to be the bond of Social Communities, and\nlegislators seem to be more anxious to secure it than Justice even. I\nmean, Unanimity is somewhat like to Friendship, and this they certainly\naim at and specially drive out faction as being inimical.\nAgain, where people are in Friendship Justice is not required;[1] but,\non the other hand, though they are just they need Friendship in\naddition, and that principle which is most truly just is thought to\npartake of the nature of Friendship.\nLastly, not only is it a thing necessary but honourable likewise: since\nwe praise those who are fond of friends, and the having numerous\nfriends is thought a matter of credit to a man; some go so far as to\nhold, that \u201cgood man\u201d and \u201cfriend\u201d are terms synonymous.\nChapter II.\nYet the disputed points respecting it are not few: some men lay down\nthat it is a kind of resemblance, and that men who are like one another\nare friends: whence come the common sayings, \u201cLike will to like,\u201d\n\u201cBirds of a feather,\u201d and so on. Others, on the contrary, say, that all\nsuch come under the maxim, \u201cTwo of a trade never agree.\u201d[2]\nAgain, some men push their enquiries on these points higher and reason\nphysically: as Euripides, who says,\n\u201cThe earth by drought consumed doth love the rain,\nAnd the great heaven, overcharged with rain,\nDoth love to fall in showers upon the earth.\u201d\nHeraclitus, again, maintains, that \u201ccontrariety is expedient, and that\nthe best agreement arises from things differing, and that all things\ncome into being in the way of the principle of antagonism.\u201d\nEmpedocles, among others, in direct opposition to these, affirms, that\n\u201clike aims at like.\u201d\nThese physical questions we will take leave to omit, inasmuch as they\nare foreign to the present enquiry; and we will examine such as are\nproper to man and concern moral characters and feelings: as, for\ninstance, \u201cDoes Friendship arise among all without distinction, or is\nit impossible for bad men to be friends?\u201d and, \u201cIs there but one\nspecies of Friendship, or several?\u201d for they who ground the opinion\nthat there is but one on the fact that Friendship admits of degrees\nhold that upon insufficient proof; because things which are different\nin species admit likewise of degrees (on this point we have spoken\nbefore).\nChapter III.\nOur view will soon be cleared on these points when we have ascertained\nwhat is properly the object-matter of Friendship: for it is thought\nthat not everything indiscriminately, but some peculiar matter alone,\nis the object of this affection; that is to say, what is good, or\npleasurable, or useful. Now it would seem that that is useful through\nwhich accrues any good or pleasure, and so the objects of Friendship,\nas absolute Ends, are the good and the pleasurable.\nA question here arises; whether it is good absolutely or that which is\ngood to the individuals, for which men feel Friendship (these two being\nsometimes distinct): and similarly in respect of the pleasurable. It\nseems then that each individual feels it towards that which is good to\nhimself, and that abstractedly it is the real good which is the object\nof Friendship, and to each individual that which is good to each. It\ncomes then to this; that each individual feels Friendship not for what\n_is_ but for that which _conveys to his mind the impression of being_\ngood to himself. But this will make no real difference, because that\nwhich is truly the object of Friendship will also convey this\nimpression to the mind.\nThere are then three causes from which men feel Friendship: but the\nterm is not applied to the case of fondness for things inanimate\nbecause there is no requital of the affection nor desire for the good\nof those objects: it certainly savours of the ridiculous to say that a\nman fond of wine wishes well to it: the only sense in which it is true\nbeing that he wishes it to be kept safe and sound for his own use and\nbenefit.[3] But to the friend they say one should wish all good for his\nsake. And when men do thus wish good to another (he not reciprocating\nthe feeling), people call them Kindly; because Friendship they describe\nas being \u201cKindliness between persons who reciprocate it.\u201d But must they\nnot add that the feeling must be mutually known? for many men are\nkindly disposed towards those whom they have never seen but whom they\nconceive to be amiable or useful: and this notion amounts to the same\nthing as a real feeling between them.\nWell, these are plainly Kindly-disposed towards one another: but how\ncan one call them friends while their mutual feelings are unknown to\none another? to complete the idea of Friendship, then, it is requisite\nthat they have kindly feelings towards one another, and wish one\nanother good from one of the aforementioned causes, and that these\nkindly feelings should be mutually known.\nChapter IV.\nAs the motives to Friendship differ in kind so do the respective\nfeelings and Friendships. The species then of Friendship are three, in\nnumber equal to the objects of it, since in the line of each there may\nbe \u201cmutual affection mutually known.\u201d\nNow they who have Friendship for one another desire one another\u2019s good\naccording to the motive of their Friendship; accordingly they whose\nmotive is utility have no Friendship for one another really, but only\nin so far as some good arises to them from one another.\nAnd they whose motive is pleasure are in like case: I mean, they have\nFriendship for men of easy pleasantry, not because they are of a given\ncharacter but because they are pleasant to themselves. So then they\nwhose motive to Friendship is utility love their friends for what is\ngood to themselves; they whose motive is pleasure do so for what is\npleasurable to themselves; that is to say, not in so far as the friend\nbeloved _is_ but in so far as he is useful or pleasurable. These\nFriendships then are a matter of result: since the object is not\nbeloved in that he is the man he is but in that he furnishes advantage\nor pleasure as the case may be.\nSuch Friendships are of course very liable to dissolution if the\nparties do not continue alike: I mean, that the others cease to have\nany Friendship for them when they are no longer pleasurable or useful.\nNow it is the nature of utility not to be permanent but constantly\nvarying: so, of course, when the motive which made them friends is\nvanished, the Friendship likewise dissolves; since it existed only\nrelatively to those circumstances.\nFriendship of this kind is thought to exist principally among the old\n(because men at that time of life pursue not what is pleasurable but\nwhat is profitable); and in such, of men in their prime and of the\nyoung, as are given to the pursuit of profit. They that are such have\nno intimate intercourse with one another; for sometimes they are not\neven pleasurable to one another; nor, in fact, do they desire such\nintercourse unless their friends are profitable to them, because they\nare pleasurable only in so far as they have hopes of advantage. With\nthese Friendships is commonly ranked that of hospitality.\nBut the Friendship of the young is thought to be based on the motive of\npleasure: because they live at the beck and call of passion and\ngenerally pursue what is pleasurable to themselves and the object of\nthe present moment: and as their age changes so likewise do their\npleasures.\nThis is the reason why they form and dissolve Friendships rapidly:\nsince the Friendship changes with the pleasurable object and such\npleasure changes quickly.\nThe young are also much given up to Love; this passion being, in great\nmeasure, a matter of impulse and based on pleasure: for which cause\nthey conceive Friendships and quickly drop them, changing often in the\nsame day: but these wish for society and intimate intercourse with\ntheir friends, since they thus attain the object of their Friendship.\nChapter V.\nThat then is perfect Friendship which subsists between those who are\ngood and whose similarity consists in their goodness: for these men\nwish one another\u2019s good in similar ways; in so far as they are good\n(and good they are in themselves); and those are specially friends who\nwish good to their friends for their sakes, because they feel thus\ntowards them on their own account and not as a mere matter of result;\nso the Friendship between these men continues to subsist so long as\nthey are good; and goodness, we know, has in it a principle of\npermanence.\nMoreover, each party is good abstractedly and also relatively to his\nfriend, for all good men are not only abstractedly good but also useful\nto one another. Such friends are also mutually pleasurable because all\ngood men are so abstractedly, and also relatively to one another,\ninasmuch as to each individual those actions are pleasurable which\ncorrespond to his nature, and all such as are like them. Now when men\nare good these will be always the same, or at least similar.\nFriendship then under these circumstances is permanent, as we should\nreasonably expect, since it combines in itself all the requisite\nqualifications of friends. I mean, that Friendship of whatever kind is\nbased upon good or pleasure (either abstractedly or relatively to the\nperson entertaining the sentiment of Friendship), and results from a\nsimilarity of some sort; and to this kind belong all the aforementioned\nrequisites in the parties themselves, because in this the parties are\nsimilar, and so on:[4] moreover, in it there is the abstractedly good\nand the abstractedly pleasant, and as these are specially the\nobject-matter of Friendship so the feeling and the state of Friendship\nis found most intense and most excellent in men thus qualified.\nRare it is probable Friendships of this kind will be, because men of\nthis kind are rare. Besides, all requisite qualifications being\npresupposed, there is further required time and intimacy: for, as the\nproverb says, men cannot know one another \u201ctill they have eaten the\nrequisite quantity of salt together;\u201d nor can they in fact admit one\nanother to intimacy, much less be friends, till each has appeared to\nthe other and been proved to be a fit object of Friendship. They who\nspeedily commence an interchange of friendly actions may be said to\nwish to be friends, but they are not so unless they are also proper\nobjects of Friendship and mutually known to be such: that is to say, a\ndesire for Friendship may arise quickly but not Friendship itself.\nWell, this Friendship is perfect both in respect of the time and in all\nother points; and exactly the same and similar results accrue to each\nparty from the other; which ought to be the case between friends.\nThe friendship based upon the pleasurable is, so to say, a copy of\nthis, since the good are sources of pleasure to one another: and that\nbased on utility likewise, the good being also useful to one another.\nBetween men thus connected Friendships are most permanent when the same\nresult accrues to both from one another, pleasure, for instance; and\nnot merely so but from the same source, as in the case of two men of\neasy pleasantry; and not as it is in that of a lover and the object of\nhis affection, these not deriving their pleasure from the same causes,\nbut the former from seeing the latter and the latter from receiving the\nattentions of the former: and when the bloom of youth fades the\nFriendship sometimes ceases also, because then the lover derives no\npleasure from seeing and the object of his affection ceases to receive\nthe attentions which were paid before: in many cases, however, people\nso connected continue friends, if being of similar tempers they have\ncome from custom to like one another\u2019s disposition.\nWhere people do not interchange pleasure but profit in matters of Love,\nthe Friendship is both less intense in degree and also less permanent:\nin fact, they who are friends because of advantage commonly part when\nthe advantage ceases; for, in reality, they never were friends of one\nanother but of the advantage.\nSo then it appears that from motives of pleasure or profit bad men may\nbe friends to one another, or good men to bad men or men of neutral\ncharacter to one of any character whatever: but disinterestedly, for\nthe sake of one another, plainly the good alone can be friends; because\nbad men have no pleasure even in themselves unless in so far as some\nadvantage arises.\nAnd further, the Friendship of the good is alone superior to calumny;\nit not being easy for men to believe a third person respecting one whom\nthey have long tried and proved: there is between good men mutual\nconfidence, and the feeling that one\u2019s friend would never have done one\nwrong, and all other such things as are expected in Friendship really\nworthy the name; but in the other kinds there is nothing to prevent all\nsuch suspicions.\nI call them Friendships, because since men commonly give the name of\nfriends to those who are connected from motives of profit (which is\njustified by political language, for alliances between states are\nthought to be contracted with a view to advantage), and to those who\nare attached to one another by the motive of pleasure (as children\nare), we may perhaps also be allowed to call such persons friends, and\nsay there are several species of Friendship; primarily and specially\nthat of the good, in that they are good, and the rest only in the way\nof resemblance: I mean, people connected otherwise are friends in that\nway in which there arises to them somewhat good and some mutual\nresemblance (because, we must remember the pleasurable is good to those\nwho are fond of it).\nThese secondary Friendships, however, do not combine very well; that is\nto say, the same persons do not become friends by reason of advantage\nand by reason of the pleasurable, for these matters of result are not\noften combined. And Friendship having been divided into these kinds,\nbad men will be friends by reason of pleasure or profit, this being\ntheir point of resemblance; while the good are friends for one\nanother\u2019s sake, that is, in so far as they are good.\nThese last may be termed abstractedly and simply friends, the former as\na matter of result and termed friends from their resemblance to these\nlast.\nChapter VI.\nFurther; just as in respect of the different virtues some men are\ntermed good in respect of a certain inward state, others in respect of\nacts of working, so is it in respect of Friendship: I mean, they who\nlive together take pleasure in, and impart good to, one another: but\nthey who are asleep or are locally separated do not perform acts, but\nonly are in such a state as to act in a friendly way if they acted at\nall: distance has in itself no direct effect upon Friendship, but only\nprevents the acting it out: yet, if the absence be protracted, it is\nthought to cause a forgetfulness even of the Friendship: and hence it\nhas been said, \u201cmany and many a Friendship doth want of intercourse\ndestroy.\u201d\nAccordingly, neither the old nor the morose appear to be calculated for\nFriendship, because the pleasurableness in them is small, and no one\ncan spend his days in company with that which is positively painful or\neven not pleasurable; since to avoid the painful and aim at the\npleasurable is one of the most obvious tendencies of human nature. They\nwho get on with one another very fairly, but are not in habits of\nintimacy, are rather like people having kindly feelings towards one\nanother than friends; nothing being so characteristic of friends as the\nliving with one another, because the necessitous desire assistance, and\nthe happy companionship, they being the last persons in the world for\nsolitary existence: but people cannot spend their time together unless\nthey are mutually pleasurable and take pleasure in the same objects, a\nquality which is thought to appertain to the Friendship of\ncompanionship.\nChapter VII.\nThe connection then subsisting between the good is Friendship _par\nexcellence_, as has already been frequently said: since that which is\nabstractedly good or pleasant is thought to be an object of Friendship\nand choice-worthy, and to each individual whatever is such to him; and\nthe good man to the good man for both these reasons.\n(Now the entertaining the sentiment is like a feeling, but Friendship\nitself like a state: because the former may have for its object even\nthings inanimate, but requital of Friendship is attended with moral\nchoice which proceeds from a moral state: and again, men wish good to\nthe objects of their Friendship for their sakes, not in the way of a\nmere feeling but of moral state.)\nAnd the good, in loving their friend, love their own good (inasmuch as\nthe good man, when brought into that relation, becomes a good to him\nwith whom he is so connected), so that either party loves his own good,\nand repays his friend equally both in wishing well and in the\npleasurable: for equality is said to be a tie of Friendship. Well,\nthese points belong most to the Friendship between good men.\nBut between morose or elderly men Friendship is less apt to arise,\nbecause they are somewhat awkward-tempered, and take less pleasure in\nintercourse and society; these being thought to be specially friendly\nand productive of Friendship: and so young men become friends quickly,\nold men not so (because people do not become friends with any, unless\nthey take pleasure in them); and in like manner neither do the morose.\nYet men of these classes entertain kindly feelings towards one another:\nthey wish good to one another and render mutual assistance in respect\nof their needs, but they are not quite friends, because they neither\nspend their time together nor take pleasure in one another, which\ncircumstances are thought specially to belong to Friendship.\nTo be a friend to many people, in the way of the perfect Friendship, is\nnot possible; just as you cannot be in love with many at once: it is,\nso to speak, a state of excess which naturally has but one object; and\nbesides, it is not an easy thing for one man to be very much pleased\nwith many people at the same time, nor perhaps to find many really\ngood. Again, a man needs experience, and to be in habits of close\nintimacy, which is very difficult.\nBut it _is_ possible to please many on the score of advantage and\npleasure: because there are many men of the kind, and the services may\nbe rendered in a very short time.\nOf the two imperfect kinds that which most resembles the perfect is the\nFriendship based upon pleasure, in which the same results accrue from\nboth and they take pleasure in one another or in the same objects; such\nas are the Friendships of the young, because a generous spirit is most\nfound in these. The Friendship because of advantage is the connecting\nlink of shopkeepers.\nThen again, the very happy have no need of persons who are profitable,\nbut of pleasant ones they have because they wish to have people to live\nintimately with; and what is painful they bear for a short time indeed,\nbut continuously no one could support it, nay, not even the Chief Good\nitself, if it were painful to him individually: and so they look out\nfor pleasant friends: perhaps they ought to require such to be good\nalso; and good moreover to themselves individually, because then they\nwill have all the proper requisites of Friendship.\nMen in power are often seen to make use of several distinct friends:\nfor some are useful to them and others pleasurable, but the two are not\noften united: because they do not, in fact, seek such as shall combine\npleasantness and goodness, nor such as shall be useful for honourable\npurposes: but with a view to attain what is pleasant they look out for\nmen of easy-pleasantry; and again, for men who are clever at executing\nany business put into their hands: and these qualifications are not\ncommonly found united in the same man.\nIt has been already stated that the good man unites the qualities of\npleasantness and usefulness: but then such a one will not be a friend\nto a superior unless he be also his superior in goodness: for if this\nbe not the case, he cannot, being surpassed in one point, make things\nequal by a proportionate degree of Friendship.[5] And characters who\nunite superiority of station and goodness are not common.\nChapter VIII.\nNow all the kinds of Friendship which have been already mentioned exist\nin a state of equality, inasmuch as either the same results accrue to\nboth and they wish the same things to one another, or else they barter\none thing against another; pleasure, for instance, against profit: it\nhas been said already that Friendships of this latter kind are less\nintense in degree and less permanent.\nAnd it is their resemblance or dissimilarity to the same thing which\nmakes them to be thought to be and not to be Friendships: they show\nlike Friendships in right of their likeness to that which is based on\nvirtue (the one kind having the pleasurable, the other the profitable,\nboth of which belong also to the other); and again, they do not show\nlike Friendships by reason of their unlikeness to that true kind; which\nunlikeness consists herein, that while that is above calumny and so\npermanent these quickly change and differ in many other points.\nBut there is another form of Friendship, that, namely, in which the one\nparty is superior to the other; as between father and son, elder and\nyounger, husband and wife, ruler and ruled. These also differ one from\nanother: I mean, the Friendship between parents and children is not the\nsame as between ruler and the ruled, nor has the father the same\ntowards the son as the son towards the father, nor the husband towards\nthe wife as she towards him; because the work, and therefore the\nexcellence, of each of these is different, and different therefore are\nthe causes of their feeling Friendship; distinct and different\ntherefore are their feelings and states of Friendship.\nAnd the same results do not accrue to each from the other, nor in fact\nought they to be looked for: but, when children render to their parents\nwhat they ought to the authors of their being, and parents to their\nsons what they ought to their offspring, the Friendship between such\nparties will be permanent and equitable.\nFurther; the feeling of Friendship should be in a due proportion in all\nFriendships which are between superior and inferior; I mean, the better\nman, or the more profitable, and so forth, should be the object of a\nstronger feeling than he himself entertains, because when the feeling\nof Friendship comes to be after a certain rate then equality in a\ncertain sense is produced, which is thought to be a requisite in\nFriendship.\n(It must be remembered, however, that the equal is not in the same case\nas regards Justice and Friendship: for in strict Justice the exactly\nproportioned equal ranks first, and the actual numerically equal ranks\nsecond, while in Friendship this is exactly reversed.)\nAnd that equality is thus requisite is plainly shown by the occurrence\nof a great difference of goodness or badness, or prosperity, or\nsomething else: for in this case, people are not any longer friends,\nnay they do not even feel that they ought to be. The clearest\nillustration is perhaps the case of the gods, because they are most\nsuperior in all good things. It is obvious too, in the case of kings,\nfor they who are greatly their inferiors do not feel entitled to be\nfriends to them; nor do people very insignificant to be friends to\nthose of very high excellence or wisdom. Of course, in such cases it is\nout of the question to attempt to define up to what point they may\ncontinue friends: for you may remove many points of agreement and the\nFriendship last nevertheless; but when one of the parties is very far\nseparated (as a god from men), it cannot continue any longer.\nThis has given room for a doubt, whether friends do really wish to\ntheir friends the very highest goods, as that they may be gods:\nbecause, in case the wish were accomplished, they would no longer have\nthem for friends, nor in fact would they have the good things they had,\nbecause friends are good things. If then it has been rightly said that\na friend wishes to his friend good things for that friend\u2019s sake, it\nmust be understood that he is to remain such as he now is: that is to\nsay, he will wish the greatest good to him of which as man he is\ncapable: yet perhaps not all, because each man desires good for himself\nmost of all.\nIt is thought that desire for honour makes the mass of men wish rather\nto be the objects of the feeling of Friendship than to entertain it\nthemselves (and for this reason they are fond of flatterers, a\nflatterer being a friend inferior or at least pretending to be such and\nrather to entertain towards another the feeling of Friendship than to\nbe himself the object of it), since the former is thought to be nearly\nthe same as being honoured, which the mass of men desire. And yet men\nseem to choose honour, not for its own sake, but incidentally:[6] I\nmean, the common run of men delight to be honoured by those in power\nbecause of the hope it raises; that is they think they shall get from\nthem anything they may happen to be in want of, so they delight in\nhonour as an earnest of future benefit. They again who grasp at honour\nat the hands of the good and those who are really acquainted with their\nmerits desire to confirm their own opinion about themselves: so they\ntake pleasure in the conviction that they are good, which is based on\nthe sentence of those who assert it. But in being the objects of\nFriendship men delight for its own sake, and so this may be judged to\nbe higher than being honoured and Friendship to be in itself\nchoice-worthy. Friendship, moreover, is thought to consist in feeling,\nrather than being the object of, the sentiment of Friendship, which is\nproved by the delight mothers have in the feeling: some there are who\ngive their children to be adopted and brought up by others, and knowing\nthem bear this feeling towards them never seeking to have it returned,\nif both are not possible; but seeming to be content with seeing them\nwell off and bearing this feeling themselves towards them, even though\nthey, by reason of ignorance, never render to them any filial regard or\nlove.\nSince then Friendship stands rather in the entertaining, than in being\nthe object of, the sentiment, and they are praised who are fond of\ntheir friends, it seems that entertaining the sentiment is the\nExcellence of friends; and so, in whomsoever this exists in due\nproportion these are stable friends and their Friendship is permanent.\nAnd in this way may they who are unequal best be friends, because they\nmay thus be made equal.\nEquality, then, and similarity are a tie to Friendship, and specially\nthe similarity of goodness, because good men, being stable in\nthemselves, are also stable as regards others, and neither ask\ndegrading services nor render them, but, so to say, rather prevent\nthem: for it is the part of the good neither to do wrong themselves nor\nto allow their friends in so doing.\nThe bad, on the contrary, have no principle of stability: in fact, they\ndo not even continue like themselves: only they come to be friends for\na short time from taking delight in one another\u2019s wickedness. Those\nconnected by motives of profit, or pleasure, hold together somewhat\nlonger: so long, that is to say, as they can give pleasure or profit\nmutually.\nThe Friendship based on motives of profit is thought to be most of all\nformed out of contrary elements: the poor man, for instance, is thus a\nfriend of the rich, and the ignorant of the man of information; that is\nto say, a man desiring that of which he is, as it happens, in want,\ngives something else in exchange for it. To this same class we may\nrefer the lover and beloved, the beautiful and the ill-favoured. For\nthis reason lovers sometimes show in a ridiculous light by claiming to\nbe the objects of as intense a feeling as they themselves entertain: of\ncourse if they are equally fit objects of Friendship they are perhaps\nentitled to claim this, but if they have nothing of the kind it is\nridiculous.\nPerhaps, moreover, the contrary does not aim at its contrary for its\nown sake but incidentally: the mean is really what is grasped at; it\nbeing good for the dry, for instance, not to become wet but to attain\nthe mean, and so of the hot, etc.\nHowever, let us drop these questions, because they are in fact somewhat\nforeign to our purpose.\nChapter IX.\nIt seems too, as was stated at the commencement, that Friendship and\nJustice have the same object-matter, and subsist between the same\npersons: I mean that in every Communion there is thought to be some\nprinciple of Justice and also some Friendship: men address as friends,\nfor instance, those who are their comrades by sea, or in war, and in\nlike manner also those who are brought into Communion with them in\nother ways: and the Friendship, because also the Justice, is\nco-extensive with the Communion, This justifies the common proverb,\n\u201cthe goods of friends are common,\u201d since Friendship rests upon\nCommunion.\nNow brothers and intimate companions have all in common, but other\npeople have their property separate, and some have more in common and\nothers less, because the Friendships likewise differ in degree. So too\ndo the various principles of Justice involved, not being the same\nbetween parents and children as between brothers, nor between\ncompanions as between fellow-citizens merely, and so on of all the\nother conceivable Friendships. Different also are the principles of\nInjustice as regards these different grades, and the acts become\nintensified by being done to friends; for instance, it is worse to rob\nyour companion than one who is merely a fellow-citizen; to refuse help\nto a brother than to a stranger; and to strike your father than any one\nelse. So then the Justice naturally increases with the degree of\nFriendship, as being between the same parties and of equal extent.\nAll cases of Communion are parts, so to say, of the great Social one,\nsince in them men associate with a view to some advantage and to\nprocure some of those things which are needful for life; and the great\nSocial Communion is thought originally to have been associated and to\ncontinue for the sake of some advantage: this being the point at which\nlegislators aim, affirming that to be just which is generally\nexpedient.\nAll the other cases of Communion aim at advantage in particular points;\nthe crew of a vessel at that which is to result from the voyage which\nis undertaken with a view to making money, or some such object;\ncomrades in war at that which is to result from the war, grasping\neither at wealth or victory, or it may be a political position; and\nthose of the same tribe, or Demus, in like manner.\nSome of them are thought to be formed for pleasure\u2019s sake, those, for\ninstance, of bacchanals or club-fellows, which are with a view to\nSacrifice or merely company. But all these seem to be ranged under the\ngreat Social one, inasmuch as the aim of this is, not merely the\nexpediency of the moment but, for life and at all times; with a view to\nwhich the members of it institute sacrifices and their attendant\nassemblies, to render honour to the gods and procure for themselves\nrespite from toil combined with pleasure. For it appears that\nsacrifices and religious assemblies in old times were made as a kind of\nfirst-fruits after the ingathering of the crops, because at such\nseasons they had most leisure.\nSo then it appears that all the instances of Communion are parts of the\ngreat Social one: and corresponding Friendships will follow upon such\nCommunions.\nChapter X.\nOf Political Constitutions there are three kinds; and equal in number\nare the deflections from them, being, so to say, corruptions of them.\nThe former are Kingship, Aristocracy, and that which recognises the\nprinciple of wealth, which it seems appropriate to call Timocracy (I\ngive to it the name of a political constitution because people commonly\ndo so). Of these the best is Monarchy, and Timocracy the worst.\nFrom Monarchy the deflection is Despotism; both being Monarchies but\nwidely differing from each other; for the Despot looks to his own\nadvantage, but the King to that of his subjects: for he is in fact no\nKing who is not thoroughly independent and superior to the rest in all\ngood things, and he that is this has no further wants: he will not then\nhave to look to his own advantage but to that of his subjects, for he\nthat is not in such a position is a mere King elected by lot for the\nnonce.\nBut Despotism is on a contrary footing to this Kingship, because the\nDespot pursues his own good: and in the case of this its inferiority is\nmost evident, and what is worse is contrary to what is best. The\nTransition to Despotism is made from Kingship, Despotism being a\ncorrupt form of Monarchy, that is to say, the bad King comes to be a\nDespot.\nFrom Aristocracy to Oligarchy the transition is made by the fault of\nthe Rulers in distributing the public property contrary to right\nproportion; and giving either all that is good, or the greatest share,\nto themselves; and the offices to the same persons always, making\nwealth their idol; thus a few bear rule and they bad men in the place\nof the best.\nFrom Timocracy the transition is to Democracy, they being contiguous:\nfor it is the nature of Timocracy to be in the hands of a multitude,\nand all in the same grade of property are equal. Democracy is the least\nvicious of all, since herein the form of the constitution undergoes\nleast change.\nWell, these are generally the changes to which the various\nConstitutions are liable, being the least in degree and the easiest to\nmake.\nLikenesses, and, as it were, models of them, one may find even in\nDomestic life: for instance, the Communion between a Father and his\nSons presents the figure of Kingship, because the children are the\nFather\u2019s care: and hence Homer names Jupiter Father because Kingship is\nintended to be a paternal rule. Among the Persians, however, the\nFather\u2019s rule is Despotic, for they treat their Sons as slaves. (The\nrelation of Master to Slaves is of the nature of Despotism because the\npoint regarded herein is the Master\u2019s interest): this now strikes me to\nbe as it ought, but the Persian custom to be mistaken; because for\ndifferent persons there should be different rules.\nBetween Husband and Wife the relation takes the form of Aristocracy,\nbecause he rules by right and in such points only as the Husband\nshould, and gives to the Wife all that befits her to have. Where the\nHusband lords it in everything he changes the relation into an\nOligarchy; because he does it contrary to right and not as being the\nbetter of the two. In some instances the Wives take the reins of\ngovernment, being heiresses: here the rule is carried on not in right\nof goodness but by reason of wealth and power, as it is in Oligarchies.\nTimocracy finds its type in the relation of Brothers: they being equal\nexcept as to such differences as age introduces: for which reason, if\nthey are very different in age, the Friendship comes to be no longer a\nfraternal one: while Democracy is represented specially by families\nwhich have no head (all being there equal), or in which the proper head\nis weak and so every member does that which is right in his own eyes.\nChapter XI.\nAttendant then on each form of Political Constitution there plainly is\nFriendship exactly co-extensive with the principle of Justice; that\nbetween a King and his Subjects being in the relation of a superiority\nof benefit, inasmuch as he benefits his subjects; it being assumed that\nhe is a good king and takes care of their welfare as a shepherd tends\nhis flock; whence Homer (to quote him again) calls Agamemnon, \u201cshepherd\nof the people.\u201d And of this same kind is the Paternal Friendship, only\nthat it exceeds the former in the greatness of the benefits done;\nbecause the father is the author of being (which is esteemed the\ngreatest benefit) and of maintenance and education (these things are\nalso, by the way, ascribed to ancestors generally): and by the law of\nnature the father has the right of rule over his sons, ancestors over\ntheir descendants, and the king over his subjects.\nThese friendships are also between superiors and inferiors, for which\nreason parents are not merely loved but also honoured. The principle of\nJustice also between these parties is not exactly the same but\naccording to proportiton, because so also is the Friendship.\nNow between Husband and Wife there is the same Friendship as in\nAristocracy: for the relation is determined by relative excellence, and\nthe better person has the greater good and each has what befits: so too\nalso is the principle of Justice between them.\nThe Fraternal Friendship is like that of Companions, because brothers\nare equal and much of an age, and such persons have generally like\nfeelings and like dispositions. Like to this also is the Friendship of\na Timocracy, because the citizens are intended to be equal and\nequitable: rule, therefore, passes from hand to hand, and is\ndistributed on equal terms: so too is the Friendship accordingly.\nIn the deflections from the constitutional forms, just as the principle\nof Justice is but small so is the Friendship also: and least of all in\nthe most perverted form: in Despotism there is little or no Friendship.\nFor generally wherever the ruler and the ruled have nothing in common\nthere is no Friendship because there is no Justice; but the case is as\nbetween an artisan and his tool, or between soul and body, and master\nand slave; all these are benefited by those who use them, but towards\nthings inanimate there is neither Friendship nor Justice: nor even\ntowards a horse or an ox, or a slave _qu\u00e2_ slave, because there is\nnothing in common: a slave as such is an animate tool, a tool an\ninanimate slave. _Qu\u00e2_ slave, then, there is no Friendship towards him,\nonly _qu\u00e2_ man: for it is thought that there is some principle of\nJustice between every man, and every other who can share in law and be\na party to an agreement; and so somewhat of Friendship, in so far as he\nis man. So in Despotisms the Friendships and the principle of Justice\nare inconsiderable in extent, but in Democracies they are most\nconsiderable because they who are equal have much in common.\nChapter XII.\nNow of course all Friendship is based upon Communion, as has been\nalready stated: but one would be inclined to separate off from the rest\nthe Friendship of Kindred, and that of Companions: whereas those of men\nof the same city, or tribe, or crew, and all such, are more peculiarly,\nit would seem, based upon Communion, inasmuch as they plainly exist in\nright of some agreement expressed or implied: among these one may rank\nalso the Friendship of Hospitality,\nThe Friendship of Kindred is likewise of many kinds, and appears in all\nits varieties to depend on the Parental: parents, I mean, love their\nchildren as being a part of themselves, children love their parents as\nbeing themselves somewhat derived from them. But parents know their\noffspring more than these know that they are from the parents, and the\nsource is more closely bound to that which is produced than that which\nis produced is to that which formed it: of course, whatever is derived\nfrom one\u2019s self is proper to that from which it is so derived (as, for\ninstance, a tooth or a hair, or any other thing whatever to him that\nhas it): but the source to it is in no degree proper, or in an inferior\ndegree at least.\nThen again the greater length of time comes in: the parents love their\noffspring from the first moment of their being, but their offspring\nthem only after a lapse of time when they have attained intelligence or\ninstinct. These considerations serve also to show why mothers have\ngreater strength of affection than fathers.\nNow parents love their children as themselves (since what is derived\nfrom themselves becomes a kind of other Self by the fact of\nseparation), but children their parents as being sprung from them. And\nbrothers love one another from being sprung from the same; that is,\ntheir sameness with the common stock creates a sameness with one\nanother;[7] whence come the phrases, \u201csame blood,\u201d \u201croot,\u201d and so on.\nIn fact they are the same, in a sense, even in the separate distinct\nindividuals.\nThen again the being brought up together, and the nearness of age, are\na great help towards Friendship, for a man likes one of his own age and\npersons who are used to one another are companions, which accounts for\nthe resemblance between the Friendship of Brothers and that of\nCompanions.\nAnd cousins and all other relatives derive their bond of union from\nthese, that is to say, from their community of origin: and the strength\nof this bond varies according to their respective distances from the\ncommon ancestor.\nFurther: the Friendship felt by children towards parents, and by men\ntowards the gods, is as towards something good and above them; because\nthese have conferred the greatest possible benefits, in that they are\nthe causes of their being and being nourished, and of their having been\neducated after they were brought into being.\nAnd Friendship of this kind has also the pleasurable and the profitable\nmore than that between persons unconnected by blood, in proportion as\ntheir life is also more shared in common. Then again in the Fraternal\nFriendship there is all that there is in that of Companions, and more\nin the good, and generally in those who are alike; in proportion as\nthey are more closely tied and from their very birth have a feeling of\naffection for one another to begin with, and as they are more like in\ndisposition who spring from the same stock and have grown up together\nand been educated alike: and besides this they have the greatest\nopportunities in respect of time for proving one another, and can\ntherefore depend most securely upon the trial.\nBetween Husband and Wife there is thought to be Friendship by a law of\nnature: man being by nature disposed to pair, more than to associate in\nCommunities: in proportion as the family is prior in order of time and\nmore absolutely necessary than the Community. And procreation is more\ncommon to him with other animals; all the other animals have Communion\nthus far, but human creatures cohabit not merely for the sake of\nprocreation but also with a view to life in general::[8] because in\nthis connection the works are immediately divided, and some belong to\nthe man, others to the woman: thus they help one the other, putting\nwhat is peculiar to each into the common stock.\nAnd for these reasons this Friendship is thought to combine the\nprofitable and the pleasurable: it will be also based upon virtue if\nthey are good people; because each has goodness and they may take\ndelight in this quality in each other. Children too are thought to be a\ntie: accordingly the childless sooner separate, for the children are a\ngood common to both and anything in common is a bond of union.\nThe question how a man is to live with his wife, or (more generally)\none friend with another, appears to be no other than this, how it is\njust that they should: because plainly there is not the same principle\nof Justice between a friend and friend, as between strangers, or\ncompanions, or mere chance fellow-travellers.\nChapter XIII.\nThere are then, as was stated at the commencement of this book, three\nkinds of Friendship, and in each there may be friends on a footing of\nequality and friends in the relation of superior and inferior; we find,\nI mean, that people who are alike in goodness, become friends, and\nbetter with worse, and so also pleasant people; again, because of\nadvantage people are friends, either balancing exactly their mutual\nprofitableness or differing from one another herein. Well then, those\nwho are equal should in right of this equality be equalised also by the\ndegree of their Friendship and the other points, and those who are on a\nfooting of inequality by rendering Friendship in proportion to the\nsuperiority of the other party.\nFault-finding and blame arises, either solely or most naturally, in\nFriendship of which utility is the motive: for they who are friends by\nreason of goodness, are eager to do kindnesses to one another because\nthis is a natural result of goodness and Friendship; and when men are\nvying with each other for this End there can be no fault-finding nor\ncontention: since no one is annoyed at one who entertains for him the\nsentiment of Friendship and does kindnesses to him, but if of a refined\nmind he requites him with kind actions. And suppose that one of the two\nexceeds the other, yet as he is attaining his object he will not find\nfault with his friend, for good is the object of each party.\nNeither can there well be quarrels between men who are friends for\npleasure\u2019s sake: because supposing them to delight in living together\nthen both attain their desire; or if not a man would be put in a\nridiculous light who should find fault with another for not pleasing\nhim, since it is in his power to forbear intercourse with him. But the\nFriendship because of advantage is very liable to fault-finding;\nbecause, as the parties use one another with a view to advantage, the\nrequirements are continually enlarging, and they think they have less\nthan of right belongs to them, and find fault because though justly\nentitled they do not get as much as they want: while they who do the\nkindnesses, can never come up to the requirements of those to whom they\nare being done.\nIt seems also, that as the Just is of two kinds, the unwritten and the\nlegal, so Friendship because of advantage is of two kinds, what may be\ncalled the Moral, and the Legal: and the most fruitful source of\ncomplaints is that parties contract obligations and discharge them not\nin the same line of Friendship. The Legal is upon specified conditions,\neither purely tradesmanlike from hand to hand or somewhat more\ngentlemanly as regards time but still by agreement a _quid pro quo_.\nIn this Legal kind the obligation is clear and admits of no dispute,\nthe friendly element is the delay in requiring its discharge: and for\nthis reason in some countries no actions can be maintained at Law for\nthe recovery of such debts, it being held that they who have dealt on\nthe footing of credit must be content to abide the issue.\nThat which may be termed the Moral kind is not upon specified\nconditions, but a man gives as to his friend and so on: but still he\nexpects to receive an equivalent, or even more, as though he had not\ngiven but lent: he also will find fault, because he does not get the\nobligation discharged in the same way as it was contracted.\nNow this results from the fact, that all men, or the generality at\nleast, _wish_ what is honourable, but, when tested, _choose_ what is\nprofitable; and the doing kindnesses disinterestedly is honourable\nwhile receiving benefits is profitable. In such cases one should, if\nable, make a return proportionate to the good received, and do so\nwillingly, because one ought not to make a disinterested friend[9] of a\nman against his inclination: one should act, I say, as having made a\nmistake originally in receiving kindness from one from whom one ought\nnot to have received it, he being not a friend nor doing the act\ndisinterestedly; one should therefore discharge one\u2019s self of the\nobligation as having received a kindness on specified terms: and if\nable a man would engage to repay the kindness, while if he were unable\neven the doer of it would not expect it of him: so that if he is able\nhe ought to repay it. But one ought at the first to ascertain from whom\none is receiving kindness, and on what understanding, that on that same\nunderstanding one may accept it or not.\nA question admitting of dispute is whether one is to measure a kindness\nby the good done to the receiver of it, and make this the standard by\nwhich to requite, or by the kind intention of the doer?\nFor they who have received kindnesses frequently plead in depreciation\nthat they have received from their benefactors such things as were\nsmall for them to give, or such as they themselves could have got from\nothers: while the doers of the kindnesses affirm that they gave the\nbest they had, and what could not have been got from others, and under\ndanger, or in such-like straits.\nMay we not say, that as utility is the motive of the Friendship the\nadvantage conferred on the receiver must be the standard? because he it\nis who requests the kindness and the other serves him in his need on\nthe understanding that he is to get an equivalent: the assistance\nrendered is then exactly proportionate to the advantage which the\nreceiver has obtained, and he should therefore repay as much as he\ngained by it, or even more, this being more creditable.\nIn Friendships based on goodness, the question, of course, is never\nraised, but herein the motive of the doer seems to be the proper\nstandard, since virtue and moral character depend principally on\nmotive.\nChapter XIV.\nQuarrels arise also in those Friendships in which the parties are\nunequal because each party thinks himself entitled to the greater\nshare, and of course, when this happens, the Friendship is broken up.\nThe man who is better than the other thinks that having the greater\nshare pertains to him of right, for that more is always awarded to the\ngood man: and similarly the man who is more profitable to another than\nthat other to him: \u201cone who is useless,\u201d they say, \u201cought not to share\nequally, for it comes to a tax, and not a Friendship, unless the fruits\nof the Friendship are reaped in proportion to the works done:\u201d their\nnotion being, that as in a money partnership they who contribute more\nreceive more so should it be in Friendship likewise.\nOn the other hand, the needy man and the less virtuous advance the\nopposite claim: they urge that \u201cit is the very business of a good\nfriend to help those who are in need, else what is the use of having a\ngood or powerful friend if one is not to reap the advantage at all?\u201d\nNow each seems to advance a right claim and to be entitled to get more\nout of the connection than the other, only _not more of the same\nthing_: but the superior man should receive more respect, the needy man\nmore profit: respect being the reward of goodness and beneficence,\nprofit being the aid of need.\nThis is plainly the principle acted upon in Political Communities: he\nreceives no honour who gives no good to the common stock: for the\nproperty of the Public is given to him who does good to the Public, and\nhonour is the property of the Public; it is not possible both to make\nmoney out of the Public and receive honour likewise; because no one\nwill put up with the less in every respect: so to him who suffers loss\nas regards money they award honour, but money to him who can be paid by\ngifts: since, as has been stated before, the observing due proportion\nequalises and preserves Friendship.\nLike rules then should be observed in the intercourse of friends who\nare unequal; and to him who advantages another in respect of money, or\ngoodness, that other should repay honour, making requital according to\nhis power; because Friendship requires what is possible, not what is\nstrictly due, this being not possible in all cases, as in the honours\npaid to the gods and to parents: no man could ever make the due return\nin these cases, and so he is thought to be a good man who pays respect\naccording to his ability.\nFor this reason it may be judged never to be allowable for a son to\ndisown his father, whereas a father may his son: because he that owes\nis bound to pay; now a son can never, by anything he has done, fully\nrequite the benefits first conferred on him by his father, and so is\nalways a debtor. But they to whom anything is owed may cast off their\ndebtors: therefore the father may his son. But at the same time it must\nperhaps be admitted, that it seems no father ever _would_ sever himself\nutterly from a son, except in a case of exceeding depravity: because,\nindependently of the natural Friendship, it is like human nature not to\nput away from one\u2019s self the assistance which a son might render. But\nto the son, if depraved, assisting his father is a thing to be avoided,\nor at least one which he will not be very anxious to do; most men being\nwilling enough to receive kindness, but averse to doing it as\nunprofitable.\nLet thus much suffice on these points.\nBOOK IX\nChapter I.\nWell, in all the Friendships the parties to which are dissimilar it is\nthe proportionate which equalises and preserves the Friendship, as has\nbeen already stated: I mean, in the Social Friendship the cobbler, for\ninstance, gets an equivalent for his shoes after a certain rate; and\nthe weaver, and all others in like manner. Now in this case a common\nmeasure has been provided in money, and to this accordingly all things\nare referred and by this are measured: but in the Friendship of Love\nthe complaint is sometimes from the lover that, though he loves\nexceedingly, his love is not requited; he having perhaps all the time\nnothing that can be the object of Friendship: again, oftentimes from\nthe object of love that he who as a suitor promised any and every thing\nnow performs nothing. These cases occur because the Friendship of the\nlover for the beloved object is based upon pleasure, that of the other\nfor him upon utility, and in one of the parties the requisite quality\nis not found: for, as these are respectively the grounds of the\nFriendship, the Friendship comes to be broken up because the motives to\nit cease to exist: the parties loved not one another but qualities in\none another which are not permanent, and so neither are the\nFriendships: whereas the Friendship based upon the moral character of\nthe parties, being independent and disinterested, is permanent, as we\nhave already stated.\nQuarrels arise also when the parties realise different results and not\nthose which they desire; for the not attaining one\u2019s special object is\nall one, in this case, with getting nothing at all: as in the\nwell-known case where a man made promises to a musician, rising in\nproportion to the excellence of his music; but when, the next morning,\nthe musician claimed the performance of his promises, he said that he\nhad given him pleasure for pleasure: of course, if each party had\nintended this, it would have been all right: but if the one desires\namusement and the other gain, and the one gets his object but the other\nnot, the dealing cannot be fair: because a man fixes his mind upon what\nhe happens to want, and will give so and so for that specific thing.\nThe question then arises, who is to fix the rate? the man who first\ngives, or the man who first takes? because, _prim\u00e2 facie_, the man who\nfirst gives seems to leave the rate to be fixed by the other party.\nThis, they say, was in fact the practice of Protagoras: when he taught\na man anything he would bid the learner estimate the worth of the\nknowledge gained by his own private opinion; and then he used to take\nso much from him. In such cases some people adopt the rule,\n\u201cWith specified reward a friend should be content.\u201d\nThey are certainly fairly found fault with who take the money in\nadvance and then do nothing of what they said they would do, their\npromises having been so far beyond their ability; for such men do not\nperform what they agreed, The Sophists, however, are perhaps obliged to\ntake this course, because no one would give a sixpence for their\nknowledge. These then, I say, are fairly found fault with, because they\ndo not what they have already taken money for doing.\nIn cases where no stipulation as to the respective services is made\nthey who disinterestedly do the first service will not raise the\nquestion (as we have said before), because it is the nature of\nFriendship, based on mutual goodness to be reference to the intention\nof the other, the intention being characteristic of the true friend and\nof goodness.\nAnd it would seem the same rule should be laid down for those who are\nconnected with one another as teachers and learners of philosophy; for\nhere the value of the commodity cannot be measured by money, and, in\nfact, an exactly equivalent price cannot be set upon it, but perhaps it\nis sufficient to do what one can, as in the case of the gods or one\u2019s\nparents.\nBut where the original giving is not upon these terms but avowedly for\nsome return, the most proper course is perhaps for the requital to be\nsuch as _both_ shall allow to be proportionate, and, where this cannot\nbe, then for the receiver to fix the value would seem to be not only\nnecessary but also fair: because when the first giver gets that which\nis equivalent to the advantage received by the other, or to what he\nwould have given to secure the pleasure he has had, then he has the\nvalue from him: for not only is this seen to be the course adopted in\nmatters of buying and selling but also in some places the law does not\nallow of actions upon voluntary dealings; on the principle that when\none man has trusted another he must be content to have the obligation\ndischarged in the same spirit as he originally contracted it: that is\nto say, it is thought fairer for the trusted, than for the trusting,\nparty, to fix the value. For, in general, those who have and those who\nwish to get things do not set the same value on them: what is their\nown, and what they give in each case, appears to them worth a great\ndeal: but yet the return is made according to the estimate of those who\nhave received first, it should perhaps be added that the receiver\nshould estimate what he has received, not by the value he sets upon it\nnow that he has it, but by that which he set upon it before he obtained\nit.\nChapter II.\nQuestions also arise upon such points as the following: Whether one\u2019s\nfather has an unlimited claim on one\u2019s services and obedience, or\nwhether the sick man is to obey his physician? or, in an election of a\ngeneral, the warlike qualities of the candidates should be alone\nregarded?\nIn like manner whether one should do a service rather to one\u2019s friend\nor to a good man? whether one should rather requite a benefactor or\ngive to one\u2019s companion, supposing that both are not within one\u2019s\npower?\nIs not the true answer that it is no easy task to determine all such\nquestions accurately, inasmuch as they involve numerous differences of\nall kinds, in respect of amount and what is honourable and what is\nnecessary? It is obvious, of course, that no one person can unite in\nhimself all claims. Again, the requital of benefits is, in general, a\nhigher duty than doing unsolicited kindnesses to one\u2019s companion; in\nother words, the discharging of a debt is more obligatory upon one than\nthe duty of giving to a companion. And yet this rule may admit of\nexceptions; for instance, which is the higher duty? for one who has\nbeen ransomed out of the hands of robbers to ransom in return his\nransomer, be he who he may, or to repay him on his demand though he has\nnot been taken by robbers, or to ransom his own father? for it would\nseem that a man ought to ransom his father even in preference to\nhimself.\nWell then, as has been said already, as a general rule the debt should\nbe discharged, but if in a particular case the giving greatly\npreponderates as being either honourable or necessary, we must be\nswayed by these considerations: I mean, in some cases the requital of\nthe obligation previously existing may not be equal; suppose, for\ninstance, that the original benefactor has conferred a kindness on a\ngood man, knowing him to be such, whereas this said good man has to\nrepay it believing him to be a scoundrel.\nAnd again, in certain cases no obligation lies on a man to lend to one\nwho has lent to him; suppose, for instance, that a bad man lent to him,\nas being a good man, under the notion that he should get repaid,\nwhereas the said good man has no hope of repayment from him being a bad\nman. Either then the case is really as we have supposed it and then the\nclaim is not equal, or it is not so but supposed to be; and still in so\nacting people are not to be thought to act wrongly. In short, as has\nbeen oftentimes stated before, all statements regarding feelings and\nactions can be definite only in proportion as their object-matter is\nso; it is of course quite obvious that all people have not the same\nclaim upon one, nor are the claims of one\u2019s father unlimited; just as\nJupiter does not claim all kinds of sacrifice without distinction: and\nsince the claims of parents, brothers, companions, and benefactors, are\nall different, we must give to each what belongs to and befits each.\nAnd this is seen to be the course commonly pursued: to marriages men\ncommonly invite their relatives, because these are from a common stock\nand therefore all the actions in any way pertaining thereto are common\nalso: and to funerals men think that relatives ought to assemble in\npreference to other people, for the same reason.\nAnd it would seem that in respect of maintenance it is our duty to\nassist our parents in preference to all others, as being their debtors,\nand because it is more honourable to succour in these respects the\nauthors of our existence than ourselves. Honour likewise we ought to\npay to our parents just as to the gods, but then, not all kinds of\nhonour: not the same, for instance, to a father as to a mother: nor\nagain to a father the honour due to a scientific man or to a general\nbut that which is a father\u2019s due, and in like manner to a mother that\nwhich is a mother\u2019s.\nTo all our elders also the honour befitting their age, by rising up in\ntheir presence, turning out of the way for them, and all similar marks\nof respect: to our companions again, or brothers, frankness and free\nparticipation in all we have. And to those of the same family, or\ntribe, or city, with ourselves, and all similarly connected with us, we\nshould constantly try to render their due, and to discriminate what\nbelongs to each in respect of nearness of connection, or goodness, or\nintimacy: of course in the case of those of the same class the\ndiscrimination is easier; in that of those who are in different classes\nit is a matter of more trouble. This, however, should not be a reason\nfor giving up the attempt, but we must observe the distinctions so far\nas it is practicable to do so.\nChapter III.\nA question is also raised as to the propriety of dissolving or not\ndissolving those Friendships the parties to which do not remain what\nthey were when the connection was formed.\nNow surely in respect of those whose motive to Friendship is utility or\npleasure there can be nothing wrong in breaking up the connection when\nthey no longer have those qualities; because they were friends [not of\none another, but] of those qualities: and, these having failed, it is\nonly reasonable to expect that they should cease to entertain the\nsentiment.\nBut a man has reason to find fault if the other party, being really\nattached to him because of advantage or pleasure, pretended to be so\nbecause of his moral character: in fact, as we said at the\ncommencement, the most common source of quarrels between friends is\ntheir not being friends on the same grounds as they suppose themselves\nto be.\nNow when a man has been deceived in having supposed himself to excite\nthe sentiment of Friendship by reason of his moral character, the other\nparty doing nothing to indicate he has but himself to blame: but when\nhe has been deceived by the pretence of the other he has a right to\nfind fault with the man who has so deceived him, aye even more than\nwith utterers of false coin, in proportion to the greater preciousness\nof that which is the object-matter of the villany.\nBut suppose a man takes up another as being a good man, who turns out,\nand is found by him, to be a scoundrel, is he bound still to entertain\nFriendship for him? or may we not say at once it is impossible? since\nit is not everything which is the object-matter of Friendship, but only\nthat which is good; and so there is no obligation to be a bad man\u2019s\nfriend, nor, in fact, ought one to be such: for one ought not to be a\nlover of evil, nor to be assimilated to what is base; which would be\nimplied, because we have said before, like is friendly to like.\nAre we then to break with him instantly? not in all cases; only where\nour friends are incurably depraved; when there is a chance of amendment\nwe are bound to aid in repairing the moral character of our friends\neven more than their substance, in proportion as it is better and more\nclosely related to Friendship. Still he who should break off the\nconnection is not to be judged to act wrongly, for he never was a\nfriend to such a character as the other now is, and therefore, since\nthe man is changed and he cannot reduce him to his original state, he\nbacks out of the connection.\nTo put another case: suppose that one party remains what he was when\nthe Friendship was formed, while the other becomes morally improved and\nwidely different from his friend in goodness; is the improved character\nto treat the other as a friend?\nMay we not say it is impossible? The case of course is clearest where\nthere is a great difference, as in the Friendships of boys: for suppose\nthat of two boyish friends the one still continues a boy in mind and\nthe other becomes a man of the highest character, how can they be\nfriends? since they neither are pleased with the same objects nor like\nand dislike the same things: for these points will not belong to them\nas regards one another, and without them it was assumed they cannot be\nfriends because they cannot live in intimacy: and of the case of those\nwho cannot do so we have spoken before.\nWell then, is the improved party to bear himself towards his former\nfriend in no way differently to what he would have done had the\nconnection never existed?\nSurely he ought to bear in mind the intimacy of past times, and just as\nwe think ourselves bound to do favours for our friends in preference to\nstrangers, so to those who have been friends and are so no longer we\nshould allow somewhat on the score of previous Friendship, whenever the\ncause of severance is not excessive depravity on their part.\nChapter IV.\nNow the friendly feelings which are exhibited towards our friends, and\nby which Friendships are characterised, seem to have sprung out of\nthose which we entertain toward ourselves.\nI mean, people define a friend to be \u201cone who intends and does what is\ngood (or what he believes to be good) to another for that other\u2019s\nsake,\u201d or \u201cone who wishes his friend to be and to live for that\nfriend\u2019s own sake\u201d (which is the feeling of mothers towards their\nchildren, and of friends who have come into collision). Others again,\n\u201cone who lives with another and chooses the same objects,\u201d or \u201cone who\nsympathises with his friend in his sorrows and in his joys\u201d (this too\nis especially the case with mothers).\nWell, by some one of these marks people generally characterise\nFriendship: and each of these the good man has towards himself, and all\nothers have them in so far as they suppose themselves to be good. (For,\nas has been said before, goodness, that is the good man, seems to be a\nmeasure to every one else.)\nFor he is at unity in himself, and with every part of his soul he\ndesires the same objects; and he wishes for himself both what is, and\nwhat he believes to be, good; and he does it (it being characteristic\nof the good man to work at what is good), and for the sake of himself,\ninasmuch as he does it for the sake of his Intellectual Principle which\nis generally thought to be a man\u2019s Self. Again, he wishes himself And\nspecially this Principle whereby he is an intelligent being, to live\nand be preserved in life, because existence is a good to him that is a\ngood man.\nBut it is to himself that each individual wishes what is good, and no\nman, conceiving the possibility of his becoming other than he now is,\nchooses that that New Self should have all things indiscriminately: a\ngod, for instance, has at the present moment the Chief Good, but he has\nit in right of being whatever he actually now is: and the Intelligent\nPrinciple must be judged to be each man\u2019s Self, or at least eminently\nso [though other Principles help, of course, to constitute him the man\nhe is].\nFurthermore, the good man wishes to continue to live with himself; for\nhe can do it with pleasure, in that his memories of past actions are\nfull of delight and his anticipations of the future are good and such\nare pleasurable. Then, again, he has good store of matter for his\nIntellect to contemplate, and he most especially sympathises with his\nSelf in its griefs and joys, because the objects which give him pain\nand pleasure are at all times the same, not one thing to-day and a\ndifferent one to-morrow: because he is not given to repentance,[1] if\none may so speak. It is then because each of these feelings are\nentertained by the good man towards his own Self and a friend feels\ntowards a friend as towards himself (a friend being in fact another\nSelf), that Friendship is thought to be some one of these things and\nthey are accounted friends in whom they are found. Whether or no there\ncan really be Friendship between a man and his Self is a question we\nwill not at present entertain: there may be thought to be Friendship,\nin so far as there are two or more of the aforesaid requisites, and\nbecause the highest degree of Friendship, in the usual acceptation of\nthat term, resembles the feeling entertained by a man towards himself.\nBut it may be urged that the aforesaid requisites are to all appearance\nfound in the common run of men, though they are men of a low stamp.\nMay it not be answered, that they share in them only in so far as they\nplease themselves, and conceive themselves to be good? for certainly,\nthey are not either really, or even apparently, found in any one of\nthose who are very depraved and villainous; we may almost say not even\nin those who are bad men at all: for they are at variance with\nthemselves and lust after different things from those which in cool\nreason they wish for, just as men who fail of Self-Control: I mean,\nthey choose things which, though hurtful, are pleasurable, in\npreference to those which in their own minds they believe to be good:\nothers again, from cowardice and indolence, decline to do what still\nthey are convinced is best for them: while they who from their\ndepravity have actually done many dreadful actions hate and avoid life,\nand accordingly kill themselves: and the wicked seek others in whose\ncompany to spend their time, but fly from themselves because they have\nmany unpleasant subjects of memory, and can only look forward to others\nlike them when in solitude but drown their remorse in the company of\nothers: and as they have nothing to raise the sentiment of Friendship\nso they never feel it towards themselves.\nNeither, in fact, can they who are of this character sympathise with\ntheir Selves in their joys and sorrows, because their soul is, as it\nwere, rent by faction, and the one principle, by reason of the\ndepravity in them, is grieved at abstaining from certain things, while\nthe other and better principle is pleased thereat; and the one drags\nthem this way and the other that way, as though actually tearing them\nasunder.[2] And though it is impossible actually to have at the same\ntime the sensations of pain and pleasure; yet after a little time the\nman is sorry for having been pleased, and he could wish that those\nobjects had not given him pleasure; for the wicked are full of remorse.\nIt is plain then that the wicked man cannot be in the position of a\nfriend even towards himself, because he has in himself nothing which\ncan excite the sentiment of Friendship. If then to be thus is\nexceedingly wretched it is a man\u2019s duty to flee from wickedness with\nall his might and to strive to be good, because thus may he be friends\nwith himself and may come to be a friend to another.\nChapter V.\nKindly Feeling, though resembling Friendship, is not identical with it,\nbecause it may exist in reference to those whom we do not know and\nwithout the object of it being aware of its existence, which Friendship\ncannot. (This, by the way, has also been said before.) And further, it\nis not even Affection because it does not imply intensity nor yearning,\nwhich are both consequences of Affection. Again Affection requires\nintimacy but Kindly Feeling may arise quite suddenly, as happens\nsometimes in respect of men against whom people are matched in any way,\nI mean they come to be kindly disposed to them and sympathise in their\nwishes, but still they would not join them in any action, because, as\nwe said, they conceive this feeling of kindness suddenly and so have\nbut a superficial liking.\nWhat it does seem to be is the starting point of a Friendship; just as\npleasure, received through the sight, is the commencement of Love: for\nno one falls in love without being first pleased with the personal\nappearance of the beloved object, and yet he who takes pleasure in it\ndoes not therefore necessarily love, but when he wearies for the object\nin its absence and desires its presence. Exactly in the same way men\ncannot be friends without having passed through the stage of Kindly\nFeeling, and yet they who are in that stage do not necessarily advance\nto Friendship: they merely have an inert wish for the good of those\ntoward whom they entertain the feeling, but would not join them in any\naction, nor put themselves out of the way for them. So that, in a\nmetaphorical way of speaking, one might say that it is dormant\nFriendship, and when it has endured for a space and ripened into\nintimacy comes to be real Friendship; but not that whose object is\nadvantage or pleasure, because such motives cannot produce even Kindly\nFeeling.\nI mean, he who has received a kindness requites it by Kindly Feeling\ntowards his benefactor, and is right in so doing: but he who wishes\nanother to be prosperous, because he has hope of advantage through his\ninstrumentality, does not seem to be kindly disposed to that person but\nrather to himself; just as neither is he his friend if he pays court to\nhim for any interested purpose.\nKindly Feeling always arises by reason of goodness and a certain\namiability, when one man gives another the notion of being a fine\nfellow, or brave man, etc., as we said was the case sometimes with\nthose matched against one another.\nChapter VI.\nUnity of Sentiment is also plainly connected with Friendship, and\ntherefore is not the same as Unity of Opinion, because this might exist\neven between people unacquainted with one another.\nNor do men usually say people are united in sentiment merely because\nthey agree in opinion on _any_ point, as, for instance, on points of\nastronomical science (Unity of Sentiment herein not having any\nconnection with Friendship), but they say that Communities have Unity\nof Sentiment when they agree respecting points of expediency and take\nthe same line and carry out what has been determined in common\nconsultation.\nThus we see that Unity of Sentiment has for its object matters of\naction, and such of these as are of importance, and of mutual, or, in\nthe case of single States, common, interest: when, for instance, all\nagree in the choice of magistrates, or forming alliance with the\nLaced\u00e6monians, or appointing Pittacus ruler (that is to say, supposing\nhe himself was willing). But when each wishes himself to be in power\n(as the brothers in the Ph\u0153niss\u00e6), they quarrel and form parties: for,\nplainly, Unity of Sentiment does not merely imply that each entertains\nthe same idea be it what it may, but that they do so in respect of the\nsame object, as when both the populace and the sensible men of a State\ndesire that the best men should be in office, because then all attain\ntheir object.\nThus Unity of Sentiment is plainly a social Friendship, as it is also\nsaid to be: since it has for its object-matter things expedient and\nrelating to life.\nAnd this Unity exists among the good: for they have it towards\nthemselves and towards one another, being, if I may be allowed the\nexpression, in the same position: I mean, the wishes of such men are\nsteady and do not ebb and flow like the Euripus, and they wish what is\njust and expedient and aim at these things in common.\nThe bad, on the contrary, can as little have Unity of Sentiment as they\ncan be real friends, except to a very slight extent, desiring as they\ndo unfair advantage in things profitable while they shirk labour and\nservice for the common good: and while each man wishes for these things\nfor himself he is jealous of and hinders his neighbour: and as they do\nnot watch over the common good it is lost. The result is that they\nquarrel while they are for keeping one another to work but are not\nwilling to perform their just share.\nChapter VII.\nBenefactors are commonly held to have more Friendship for the objects\nof their kindness than these for them: and the fact is made a subject\nof discussion and enquiry, as being contrary to reasonable expectation.\nThe account of the matter which satisfies most persons is that the one\nare debtors and the others creditors: and therefore that, as in the\ncase of actual loans the debtors wish their creditors out of the way\nwhile the creditors are anxious for the preservation of their debtors,\nso those who have done kindnesses desire the continued existence of the\npeople they have done them to, under the notion of getting a return of\ntheir good offices, while these are not particularly anxious about\nrequital.\nEpicharmus, I suspect, would very probably say that they who give this\nsolution judge from their own baseness; yet it certainly is like human\nnature, for the generality of men have short memories on these points,\nand aim rather at receiving than conferring benefits.\nBut the real cause, it would seem, rests upon nature, and the case is\nnot parallel to that of creditors; because in this there is no\naffection to the persons, but merely a wish for their preservation with\na view to the return: whereas, in point of fact, they who have done\nkindnesses feel friendship and love for those to whom they have done\nthem, even though they neither are, nor can by possibility hereafter\nbe, in a position to serve their benefactors.\nAnd this is the case also with artisans; every one, I mean, feels more\naffection for his own work than that work possibly could for him if it\nwere animate. It is perhaps specially the case with poets: for these\nentertain very great affection for their poems, loving them as their\nown children. It is to this kind of thing I should be inclined to\ncompare the case of benefactors: for the object of their kindness is\ntheir own work, and so they love this more than this loves its creator.\nAnd the account of this is that existence is to all a thing\nchoice-worthy and an object of affection; now we exist by acts of\nworking, that is, by living and acting; he then that has created a\ngiven work exists, it may be said, by his act of working: therefore he\nloves his work because he loves existence. And this is natural, for the\nwork produced displays in act what existed before potentially.\nThen again, the benefactor has a sense of honour in right of his\naction, so that he may well take pleasure in him in whom this resides;\nbut to him who has received the benefit there is nothing honourable in\nrespect of his benefactor, only something advantageous which is both\nless pleasant and less the object of Friendship.\nAgain, pleasure is derived from the actual working out of a present\naction, from the anticipation of a future one, and from the\nrecollection of a past one: but the highest pleasure and special object\nof affection is that which attends on the actual working. Now the\nbenefactor\u2019s work abides (for the honourable is enduring), but the\nadvantage of him who has received the kindness passes away.\nAgain, there is pleasure in recollecting honourable actions, but in\nrecollecting advantageous ones there is none at all or much less (by\nthe way though, the contrary is true of the expectation of advantage).\nFurther, the entertaining the feeling of Friendship is like acting on\nanother; but being the object of the feeling is like being acted upon.\nSo then, entertaining the sentiment of Friendship, and all feelings\nconnected with it, attend on those who, in the given case of a\nbenefaction, are the superior party.\nOnce more: all people value most what has cost them much labour in the\nproduction; for instance, people who have themselves made their money\nare fonder of it than those who have inherited it: and receiving\nkindness is, it seems, unlaborious, but doing it is laborious. And this\nis the reason why the female parents are most fond of their offspring;\nfor their part in producing them is attended with most labour, and they\nknow more certainly that they are theirs. This feeling would seem also\nto belong to benefactors.\nChapter VIII.\nA question is also raised as to whether it is right to love one\u2019s Self\nbest, or some one else: because men find fault with those who love\nthemselves best, and call them in a disparaging way lovers of Self; and\nthe bad man is thought to do everything he does for his own sake\nmerely, and the more so the more depraved he is; accordingly men\nreproach him with never doing anything unselfish: whereas the good man\nacts from a sense of honour (and the more so the better man he is), and\nfor his friend\u2019s sake, and is careless of his own interest.\nBut with these theories facts are at variance, and not unnaturally: for\nit is commonly said also that a man is to love most him who is most his\nfriend, and he is most a friend who wishes good to him to whom he\nwishes it for that man\u2019s sake even though no one knows. Now these\nconditions, and in fact all the rest by which a friend is\ncharacterised, belong specially to each individual in respect of his\nSelf: for we have said before that all the friendly feelings are\nderived to others from those which have Self primarily for their\nobject. And all the current proverbs support this view; for instance,\n\u201cone soul,\u201d \u201cthe goods of friends are common,\u201d \u201cequality is a tie of\nFriendship,\u201d \u201cthe knee is nearer than the shin.\u201d For all these things\nexist specially with reference to a man\u2019s own Self: he is specially a\nfriend to himself and so he is bound to love himself the most.\nIt is with good reason questioned which of the two parties one should\nfollow, both having plausibility on their side. Perhaps then, in\nrespect of theories of this kind, the proper course is to distinguish\nand define how far each is true, and in what way. If we could ascertain\nthe sense in which each uses the term \u201cSelf-loving,\u201d this point might\nbe cleared up.\nWell now, they who use it disparagingly give the name to those who, in\nrespect of wealth, and honours, and pleasures of the body, give to\nthemselves the larger share: because the mass of mankind grasp after\nthese and are earnest about them as being the best things; which is the\nreason why they are matters of contention. They who are covetous in\nregard to these gratify their lusts and passions in general, that is to\nsay the irrational part of their soul: now the mass of mankind are so\ndisposed, for which reason the appellation has taken its rise from that\nmass which is low and bad. Of course they are justly reproached who are\nSelf-loving in this sense.\nAnd that the generality of men are accustomed to apply the term to\ndenominate those who do give such things to themselves is quite plain:\nsuppose, for instance, that a man were anxious to do, more than other\nmen, acts of justice, or self-mastery, or any other virtuous acts, and,\nin general, were to secure to himself that which is abstractedly noble\nand honourable, no one would call him Self-loving, nor blame him.\nYet might such an one be judged to be more truly Self-loving: certainly\nhe gives to himself the things which are most noble and most good, and\ngratifies that Principle of his nature which is most rightfully\nauthoritative, and obeys it in everything: and just as that which\npossesses the highest authority is thought to constitute a Community or\nany other system, so also in the case of Man: and so he is most truly\nSelf-loving who loves and gratifies this Principle.\nAgain, men are said to have, or to fail of having, self-control,\naccording as the Intellect controls or not, it being plainly implied\nthereby that this Principle constitutes each individual; and people are\nthought to have done of themselves, and voluntarily, those things\nspecially which are done with Reason.\nIt is plain, therefore, that this Principle does, either entirely or\nspecially constitute the individual man, and that the good man\nspecially loves this. For this reason then he must be specially\nSelf-loving, in a kind other than that which is reproached, and as far\nsuperior to it as living in accordance with Reason is to living at the\nbeck and call of passion, and aiming at the truly noble to aiming at\napparent advantage.\nNow all approve and commend those who are eminently earnest about\nhonourable actions, and if all would vie with one another in respect of\nthe \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f78\u03bd, and be intent upon doing what is most truly noble and\nhonourable, society at large would have all that is proper while each\nindividual in particular would have the greatest of goods, Virtue being\nassumed to be such.\nAnd so the good man ought to be Self-loving: because by doing what is\nnoble he will have advantage himself and will do good to others: but\nthe bad man ought not to be, because he will harm himself and his\nneighbours by following low and evil passions. In the case of the bad\nman, what he ought to do and what he does are at variance, but the good\nman does what he ought to do, because all Intellect chooses what is\nbest for itself and the good man puts himself under the direction of\nIntellect.\nOf the good man it is true likewise that he does many things for the\nsake of his friends and his country, even to the extent of dying for\nthem, if need be: for money and honours, and, in short, all the good\nthings which others fight for, he will throw away while eager to secure\nto himself the \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f78\u03bd: he will prefer a brief and great joy to a tame\nand enduring one, and to live nobly for one year rather than ordinarily\nfor many, and one great and noble action to many trifling ones. And\nthis is perhaps that which befals men who die for their country and\nfriends; they choose great glory for themselves: and they will lavish\ntheir own money that their friends may receive more, for hereby the\nfriend gets the money but the man himself the \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1f78\u03bd; so, in fact he\ngives to himself the greater good. It is the same with honours and\noffices; all these things he will give up to his friend, because this\nreflects honour and praise on himself: and so with good reason is he\nesteemed a fine character since he chooses the honourable before all\nthings else. It is possible also to give up the opportunities of action\nto a friend; and to have caused a friend\u2019s doing a thing may be more\nnoble than having done it one\u2019s self.\nIn short, in all praiseworthy things the good man does plainly give to\nhimself a larger share of the honourable. In this sense it is right to\nbe Self-loving, in the vulgar acceptation of the term it is not.\nChapter IX.\nA question is raised also respecting the Happy man, whether he will\nwant Friends, or no?\nSome say that they who are blessed and independent have no need of\nFriends, for they already have all that is good, and so, as being\nindependent, want nothing further: whereas the notion of a friend\u2019s\noffice is to be as it were a second Self and procure for a man what he\ncannot get by himself: hence the saying,\n\u201cWhen Fortune gives us good, what need we Friends?\u201d\nOn the other hand, it looks absurd, while we are assigning to the Happy\nman all other good things, not to give him Friends, which are, after\nall, thought to be the greatest of external goods.\nAgain, if it is more characteristic of a friend to confer than to\nreceive kindnesses, and if to be beneficent belongs to the good man and\nto the character of virtue, and if it is more noble to confer\nkindnesses on friends than strangers, the good man will need objects\nfor his benefactions. And out of this last consideration springs a\nquestion whether the need of Friends be greater in prosperity or\nadversity, since the unfortunate man wants people to do him kindnesses\nand they who are fortunate want objects for their kind acts.\nAgain, it is perhaps absurd to make our Happy man a solitary, because\nno man would choose the possession of all goods in the world on the\ncondition of solitariness, man being a social animal and formed by\nnature for living with others: of course the Happy man has this\nqualification since he has all those things which are good by nature:\nand it is obvious that the society of friends and good men must be\npreferable to that of strangers and ordinary people, and we conclude,\ntherefore, that the Happy man does need Friends.\nBut then, what do they mean whom we quoted first, and how are they\nright? Is it not that the mass of mankind mean by Friends those who are\nuseful? and of course the Happy man will not need such because he has\nall good things already; neither will he need such as are Friends with\na view to the pleasurable, or at least only to a slight extent; because\nhis life, being already pleasurable, does not want pleasure imported\nfrom without; and so, since the Happy man does not need Friends of\nthese kinds, he is thought not to need any at all.\nBut it may be, this is not true: for it was stated originally, that\nHappiness is a kind of Working; now Working plainly is something that\nmust come into being, not be already there like a mere piece of\nproperty.\nIf then the being happy consists in living and working, and the good\nman\u2019s working is in itself excellent and pleasurable (as we said at the\ncommencement of the treatise), and if what is our own reckons among\nthings pleasurable, and if we can view our neighbours better than\nourselves and their actions better than we can our own, then the\nactions of their Friends who are good men are pleasurable to the good;\ninasmuch as they have both the requisites which are naturally pleasant.\nSo the man in the highest state of happiness will need Friends of this\nkind, since he desires to contemplate good actions, and actions of his\nown, which those of his friend, being a good man, are.\nAgain, common opinion requires that the Happy man live with pleasure to\nhimself: now life is burthensome to a man in solitude, for it is not\neasy to work continuously by one\u2019s self, but in company with, and in\nregard to others, it is easier, and therefore the working, being\npleasurable in itself will be more continuous (a thing which should be\nin respect of the Happy man); for the good man, in that he is good\ntakes pleasure in the actions which accord with Virtue and is annoyed\nat those which spring from Vice, just as a musical man is pleased with\nbeautiful music and annoyed by bad. And besides, as Theognis says,\nVirtue itself may be improved by practice, from living with the good.\nAnd, upon the following considerations more purely metaphysical, it\nwill probably appear that the good friend is naturally choice-worthy to\nthe good man. We have said before, that whatever is naturally good is\nalso in itself good and pleasant to the good man; now the fact of\nliving, so far as animals are concerned, is characterised generally by\nthe power of sentience, in man it is characterised by that of\nsentience, or of rationality (the faculty of course being referred to\nthe actual operation of the faculty, certainly the main point is the\nactual operation of it); so that living seems mainly to consist in the\nact of sentience or exerting rationality: now the fact of living is in\nitself one of the things that are good and pleasant (for it is a\ndefinite totality, and whatever is such belongs to the nature of good),\nbut what is naturally good is good to the good man: for which reason it\nseems to be pleasant to all. (Of course one must not suppose a life\nwhich is depraved and corrupted, nor one spent in pain, for that which\nis such is indefinite as are its inherent qualities: however, what is\nto be said of pain will be clearer in what is to follow.)\nIf then the fact of living is in itself good and pleasant (and this\nappears from the fact that all desire it, and specially those who are\ngood and in high happiness; their course of life being most\nchoice-worthy and their existence most choice-worthy likewise), then\nalso he that sees perceives that he sees; and he that hears perceives\nthat he hears; and he that walks perceives that he walks; and in all\nthe other instances in like manner there is a faculty which reflects\nupon and perceives the fact that we are working, so that we can\nperceive that we perceive and intellectually know that we\nintellectually know: but to perceive that we perceive or that we\nintellectually know is to perceive that we exist, since existence was\ndefined to be perceiving or intellectually knowing. Now to perceive\nthat one lives is a thing pleasant in itself, life being a thing\nnaturally good, and the perceiving of the presence in ourselves of\nthings naturally good being pleasant.\nTherefore the fact of living is choice-worthy, and to the good\nspecially so since existence is good and pleasant to them: for they\nreceive pleasure from the internal consciousness of that which in\nitself is good.\nBut the good man is to his friend as to himself, friend being but a\nname for a second Self; therefore as his own existence is choice-worthy\nto each so too, or similarly at least, is his friend\u2019s existence. But\nthe ground of one\u2019s own existence being choice-worthy is the perceiving\nof one\u2019s self being good, any such perception being in itself pleasant.\nTherefore one ought to be thoroughly conscious of one\u2019s friend\u2019s\nexistence, which will result from living with him, that is sharing in\nhis words and thoughts: for this is the meaning of the term as applied\nto the human species, not mere feeding together as in the case of\nbrutes.\nIf then to the man in a high state of happiness existence is in itself\nchoice-worthy, being naturally good and pleasant, and so too a friend\u2019s\nexistence, then the friend also must be among things choice-worthy. But\nwhatever is choice-worthy to a man he should have or else he will be in\nthis point deficient. The man therefore who is to come up to our notion\n\u201cHappy\u201d will need good Friends.\nChapter X.\nAre we then to make our friends as numerous as possible? or, as in\nrespect of acquaintance it is thought to have been well said \u201chave not\nthou many acquaintances yet be not without;\u201d so too in respect of\nFriendship may we adopt the precept, and say that a man should not be\nwithout friends, nor again have exceeding many friends?\nNow as for friends who are intended for use, the maxim I have quoted\nwill, it seems, fit in exceedingly well, because to requite the\nservices of many is a matter of labour, and a whole life would not be\nlong enough to do this for them. So that, if more numerous than what\nwill suffice for one\u2019s own life, they become officious, and are\nhindrances in respect of living well: and so we do not want them. And\nagain of those who are to be for pleasure a few are quite enough, just\nlike sweetening in our food.\nBut of the good are we to make as many as ever we can, or is there any\nmeasure of the number of friends, as there is of the number to\nconstitute a Political Community? I mean, you cannot make one out of\nten men, and if you increase the number to one hundred thousand it is\nnot any longer a Community. However, the number is not perhaps some one\ndefinite number but any between certain extreme limits.\nWell, of friends likewise there is a limited number, which perhaps may\nbe laid down to be the greatest number with whom it would be possible\nto keep up intimacy; this being thought to be one of the greatest marks\nof Friendship, and it being quite obvious that it is not possible to be\nintimate with many, in other words, to part one\u2019s self among many. And\nbesides it must be remembered that they also are to be friends to one\nanother if they are all to live together: but it is a matter of\ndifficulty to find this in many men at once.\nIt comes likewise to be difficult to bring home to one\u2019s self the joys\nand sorrows of many: because in all probability one would have to\nsympathise at the same time with the joys of this one and the sorrows\nof that other.\nPerhaps then it is well not to endeavour to have very many friends but\nso many as are enough for intimacy: because, in fact, it would seem not\nto be possible to be very much a friend to many at the same time: and,\nfor the same reason, not to be in love with many objects at the same\ntime: love being a kind of excessive Friendship which implies but one\nobject: and all strong emotions must be limited in the number towards\nwhom they are felt.\nAnd if we look to facts this seems to be so: for not many at a time\nbecome friends in the way of companionship, all the famous Friendships\nof the kind are between _two_ persons: whereas they who have many\nfriends, and meet everybody on the footing of intimacy, seem to be\nfriends really to no one except in the way of general society; I mean\nthe characters denominated as over-complaisant.\nTo be sure, in the way merely of society, a man may be a friend to many\nwithout being necessarily over-complaisant, but being truly good: but\none cannot be a friend to many because of their virtue, and for the\npersons\u2019 own sake; in fact, it is a matter for contentment to find even\na few such.\nChapter XI.\nAgain: are friends most needed in prosperity or in adversity? they are\nrequired, we know, in both states, because the unfortunate need help\nand the prosperous want people to live with and to do kindnesses to:\nfor they have a desire to act kindly to some one.\nTo have friends is more necessary in adversity, and therefore in this\ncase useful ones are wanted; and to have them in prosperity is more\nhonourable, and this is why the prosperous want good men for friends,\nit being preferable to confer benefits on, and to live with, these. For\nthe very presence of friends is pleasant even in adversity: since men\nwhen grieved are comforted by the sympathy of their friends.\nAnd from this, by the way, the question might be raised, whether it is\nthat they do in a manner take part of the weight of calamities, or only\nthat their presence, being pleasurable, and the consciousness of their\nsympathy, make the pain of the sufferer less.\nHowever, we will not further discuss whether these which have been\nsuggested or some other causes produce the relief, at least the effect\nwe speak of is a matter of plain fact.\nBut their presence has probably a mixed effect: I mean, not only is the\nvery seeing friends pleasant, especially to one in misfortune, and\nactual help towards lessening the grief is afforded (the natural\ntendency of a friend, if he is gifted with tact, being to comfort by\nlook and word, because he is well acquainted with the sufferer\u2019s temper\nand disposition and therefore knows what things give him pleasure and\npain), but also the perceiving a friend to be grieved at his\nmisfortunes causes the sufferer pain, because every one avoids being\ncause of pain to his friends. And for this reason they who are of a\nmanly nature are cautious not to implicate their friends in their pain;\nand unless a man is exceedingly callous to the pain of others he cannot\nbear the pain which is thus caused to his friends: in short, he does\nnot admit men to wail with him, not being given to wail at all: women,\nit is true, and men who resemble women, like to have others to groan\nwith them, and love such as friends and sympathisers. But it is plain\nthat it is our duty in all things to imitate the highest character.\nOn the other hand, the advantages of friends in our prosperity are the\npleasurable intercourse and the consciousness that they are pleased at\nour good fortune.\nIt would seem, therefore, that we ought to call in friends readily on\noccasion of good fortune, because it is noble to be ready to do good to\nothers: but on occasion of bad fortune, we should do so with\nreluctance; for we should as little as possible make others share in\nour ills; on which principle goes the saying, \u201cI am unfortunate, let\nthat suffice.\u201d The most proper occasion for calling them in is when\nwith small trouble or annoyance to themselves they can be of very great\nuse to the person who needs them.\nBut, on the contrary, it is fitting perhaps to go to one\u2019s friends in\ntheir misfortunes unasked and with alacrity (because kindness is the\nfriend\u2019s office and specially towards those who are in need and who do\nnot demand it as a right, this being more creditable and more pleasant\nto both); and on occasion of their good fortune to go readily, if we\ncan forward it in any way (because men need their friends for this\nlikewise), but to be backward in sharing it, any great eagerness to\nreceive advantage not being creditable.\nOne should perhaps be cautious not to present the appearance of\nsullenness in declining the sympathy or help of friends, for this\nhappens occasionally.\nIt appears then that the presence of friends is, under all\ncircumstances, choice-worthy.\nChapter XII.\nMay we not say then that, as seeing the beloved object is most prized\nby lovers and they choose this sense rather than any of the others\nbecause Love\n\u201cIs engendered in the eyes,\nWith gazing fed,\u201d\nin like manner intimacy is to friends most choice-worthy, Friendship\nbeing communion? Again, as a man is to himself so is he to his friend;\nnow with respect to himself the perception of his own existence is\nchoice-worthy, therefore is it also in respect of his friend.\nAnd besides, their Friendship is acted out in intimacy, and so with\ngood reason they desire this. And whatever in each man\u2019s opinion\nconstitutes existence, or whatsoever it is for the sake of which they\nchoose life, herein they wish their friends to join with them; and so\nsome men drink together, others gamble, others join in gymnastic\nexercises or hunting, others study philosophy together: in each case\nspending their days together in that which they like best of all things\nin life, for since they wish to be intimate with their friends they do\nand partake in those things whereby they think to attain this object.\nTherefore the Friendship of the wicked comes to be depraved; for, being\nunstable, they share in what is bad and become depraved in being made\nlike to one another: but the Friendship of the good is good, growing\nwith their intercourse; they improve also, as it seems, by repeated\nacts, and by mutual correction, for they receive impress from one\nanother in the points which give them pleasure; whence says the Poet,\n\u201cThou from the good, good things shalt surely learn.\u201d\nHere then we will terminate our discourse of Friendship. The next thing\nis to go into the subject of Pleasure.\nBOOK X\nChapter I.\nNext, it would seem, follows a discussion respecting Pleasure, for it\nis thought to be most closely bound up with our kind: and so men train\nthe young, guiding them on their course by the rudders of Pleasure and\nPain. And to like and dislike what one ought is judged to be most\nimportant for the formation of good moral character: because these\nfeelings extend all one\u2019s life through, giving a bias towards and\nexerting an influence on the side of Virtue and Happiness, since men\nchoose what is pleasant and avoid what is painful.\nSubjects such as these then, it would seem, we ought by no means to\npass by, and specially since they involve much difference of opinion.\nThere are those who call Pleasure the Chief Good; there are others who\non the contrary maintain that it is exceedingly bad;[1] some perhaps\nfrom a real conviction that such is the case, others from a notion that\nit is better, in reference to our life and conduct, to show up Pleasure\nas bad, even if it is not so really; arguing that, as the mass of men\nhave a bias towards it and are the slaves of their pleasures, it is\nright to draw them to the contrary, for that so they may possibly\narrive at the mean.[2]\nI confess I suspect the soundness of this policy; in matters respecting\nmen\u2019s feelings and actions theories are less convincing than facts:\nwhenever, therefore, they are found conflicting with actual experience,\nthey not only are despised but involve the truth in their fall: he, for\ninstance, who deprecates Pleasure, if once seen to aim at it, gets the\ncredit of backsliding to it as being universally such as he said it\nwas, the mass of men being incapable of nice distinctions.\nReal accounts, therefore, of such matters seem to be most expedient,\nnot with a view to knowledge merely but to life and conduct: for they\nare believed as being in harm with facts, and so they prevail with the\nwise to live in accordance with them.\nBut of such considerations enough: let us now proceed to the current\nmaxims respecting Pleasure.\nChapter II.\nNow Eudoxus thought Pleasure to be the Chief Good because he saw all,\nrational and irrational alike, aiming at it: and he argued that, since\nin all what was the object of choice must be good and what most so the\nbest, the fact of all being drawn to the same thing proved this thing\nto be the best for all: \u201cFor each,\u201d he said, \u201cfinds what is good for\nitself just as it does its proper nourishment, and so that which is\ngood for all, and the object of the aim of all, is their Chief Good.\u201d\n(And his theories were received, not so much for their own sake, as\nbecause of his excellent moral character; for he was thought to be\neminently possessed of perfect self-mastery, and therefore it was not\nthought that he said these things because he was a lover of Pleasure\nbut that he really was so convinced.)\nAnd he thought his position was not less proved by the argument from\nthe contrary: that is, since Pain was in itself an object of avoidance\nto all the contrary must be in like manner an object of choice.\nAgain he urged that that is most choice-worthy which we choose, not by\nreason of, or with a view to, anything further; and that Pleasure is\nconfessedly of this kind because no one ever goes on to ask to what\npurpose he is pleased, feeling that Pleasure is in itself\nchoice-worthy.\nAgain, that when added to any other good it makes it more\nchoice-worthy; as, for instance, to actions of justice, or perfected\nself-mastery; and good can only be increased by itself.\nHowever, this argument at least seems to prove only that it belongs to\nthe class of goods, and not that it does so more than anything else:\nfor every good is more choicewortby in combination with some other than\nwhen taken quite alone. In fact, it is by just such an argument that\nPlato proves that Pleasure is not the Chief Good:[3] \u201cFor,\u201d says he,\n\u201cthe life of Pleasure is more choice-worthy in combination with\nPractical Wisdom than apart from it; but, if the compound better then\nsimple Pleasure cannot be the Chief Good; because the very Chief Good\ncannot by any addition become choice-worthy than it is already:\u201d and it\nis obvious that nothing else can be the Chief Good, which by\ncombination with any of the things in themselves good comes to be more\nchoice-worthy.\nWhat is there then of such a nature? (meaning, of course, whereof we\ncan partake; because that which we are in search of must be such).\nAs for those who object that \u201cwhat all aim at is not necessarily good,\u201d\nI confess I cannot see much in what they say, because what all _think_\nwe say _is_. And he who would cut away this ground from under us will\nnot bring forward things more dependable: because if the argument had\nrested on the desires of irrational creatures there might have been\nsomething in what he says, but, since the rational also desire\nPleasure, how can his objection be allowed any weight? and it may be\nthat, even in the lower animals, there is some natural good principle\nabove themselves which aims at the good peculiar to them.\nNor does that seem to be sound which is urged respecting the argument\nfrom the contrary: I mean, some people say \u201cit does not follow that\nPleasure must be good because Pain is evil, since evil may be opposed\nto evil, and both evil and good to what is indifferent:\u201d now what they\nsay is right enough in itself but does not hold in the present\ninstance. If both Pleasure and Pain were bad both would have been\nobjects of avoidance; or if neither then neither would have been, at\nall events they must have fared alike: but now men do plainly avoid the\none as bad and choose the other as good, and so there is a complete\nopposition.\nNor again is Pleasure therefore excluded from being good because it\ndoes not belong to the class of qualities:[4] the acts of Virtue are\nnot qualities, neither is Happiness [yet surely both are goods].\nAgain, they say the Chief Good is limited but Pleasure unlimited, in\nthat it admits of degrees.\nNow if they judge this from the act of feeling Pleasure then the same\nthing will apply to justice and all the other virtues,[5] in respect of\nwhich clearly it is said that men are more or less of such and such\ncharacters (according to the different virtues), they are more just or\nmore brave, or one may practise justice and self-mastery more or less.\nIf, on the other hand, they judge in respect of the Pleasures\nthemselves then it may be they miss the true cause, namely that some\nare unmixed and others mixed: for just as health being in itself\nlimited, admits of degrees, why should not Pleasure do so and yet be\nlimited? in the former case we account for it by the fact that there is\nnot the same adjustment of parts in all men, nor one and the same\nalways in the same individual: but health, though relaxed, remains up\nto a certain point, and differs in degrees; and of course the same may\nbe the case with Pleasure.\nAgain, assuming the Chief Good to be perfect and all Movements[6] and\nGenerations imperfect, they try to shew that Pleasure is a Movement and\na Generation.\nYet they do not seem warranted in saying even that it is a Movement:\nfor to every Movement are thought to belong swiftness and slowness, and\nif not in itself, as to that of the universe, yet relatively: but to\nPleasure neither of these belongs: for though one may have got quickly\ninto the state Pleasure, as into that of anger, one cannot be in the\nstate quickly,[7] nor relatively to the state of any other person; but\nwe can walk or grow, and so on, quickly or slowly.\nOf course it is possible to change into the state of Pleasure quickly\nor slowly, but to act in the state (by which, I mean, have the\nperception of Pleasure) quickly, is not possible.\nAnd how can it be a Generation? because, according to notions generally\nheld, not _any_thing is generated from _any_thing, but a thing resolves\nitself into that out of which it was generated: whereas of that of\nwhich Pleasure is a Generation Pain is a Destruction.\nAgain, they say that Pain is a lack of something suitable to nature and\nPleasure a supply of it.\nBut these are affections of the body: now if Pleasure really is a\nsupplying of somewhat suitable to nature, that must feel the Pleasure\nin which the supply takes place, therefore the body of course: yet this\nis not thought to be so: neither then is Pleasure a supplying, only a\nperson of course will be pleased when a supply takes place just as he\nwill be pained when he is cut short.\nThis notion would seem to have arisen out of the Pains and Pleasures\nconnected with natural nourishment; because, when people have felt a\nlack and so have had Pain first, they, of course, are pleased with the\nsupply of their lack.\nBut this is not the case with all Pleasures: those attendant on\nmathematical studies, for instance, are unconnected with any Pain; and\nof such as attend on the senses those which arise through the sense of\nSmell; and again, many sounds, and sights, and memories, and hopes: now\nof what can these be Generations? because there has been here no lack\nof anything to be afterwards supplied.\nAnd to those who bring forward disgraceful Pleasures we may reply that\nthese are not really pleasant things; for it does not follow because\nthey are pleasant to the ill-disposed that we are to admit that they\nare pleasant except to them; just as we should not say that those\nthings are really wholesome, or sweet, or bitter, which are so to the\nsick, or those objects really white which give that impression to\npeople labouring under ophthalmia.[8]\nOr we might say thus, that the Pleasures are choice-worthy but not as\nderived from these sources: just as wealth is, but not as the price of\ntreason; or health, but not on the terms of eating anything however\nloathsome.\nOr again, may we not say that Pleasures differ in kind? those derived\nfrom honourable objects, for instance are different from those arising\nfrom disgraceful ones; and it is not possible to experience the\nPleasure of the just man without being just, or of the musical man\nwithout being musical; and so on of others.\nThe distinction commonly drawn between the friend and the flatterer\nwould seem to show clearly either that Pleasure is not a good, or that\nthere are different kinds of Pleasure: for the former is thought to\nhave good as the object of his intercourse, the latter Pleasure only;\nand this last is reproached, but the former men praise as having\ndifferent objects in his intercourse.\nAgain, no one would choose to live with a child\u2019s intellect all his\nlife through, though receiving the highest possible Pleasure from such\nobjects as children receive it from; or to take Pleasure in doing any\nof the most disgraceful things, though sure never to be pained.\nThere are many things also about which we should be diligent even\nthough they brought no Pleasure; as seeing, remembering, knowing,\npossessing the various Excellences; and the fact that Pleasures do\nfollow on these naturally makes no difference, because we should\ncertainly choose them even though no Pleasure resulted from them.\nIt seems then to be plain that Pleasure is not the Chief Good, nor is\nevery kind of it choice-worthy: and that there are some choice-worthy\nin themselves, differing in kind, _i.e._ in the sources from which they\nare derived. Let this then suffice by way of an account of the current\nmaxims respecting Pleasure and Pain.\nChapter III.\nNow what it is, and how characterised, will be more plain if we take up\nthe subject afresh.\nAn act of Sight is thought to be complete at any moment; that is to\nsay, it lacks nothing the accession of which subsequently will complete\nits whole nature.\nWell, Pleasure resembles this: because it is a whole, as one may say;\nand one could not at any moment of time take a Pleasure whose whole\nnature would be completed by its lasting for a longer time. And for\nthis reason it is not a Movement: for all Movement takes place in time\nof certain duration and has a certain End to accomplish; for instance,\nthe Movement of house-building[9] is then only complete when the\nbuilder has produced what he intended, that is, either in the whole\ntime [necessary to complete the whole design], or in a given\nportion.[10] But all the subordinate Movements are incomplete in the\nparts of the time, and are different in kind from the whole movement\nand from one another (I mean, for instance, that the fitting the stones\ntogether is a Movement different from that of fluting the column, and\nboth again from the construction of the Temple as a whole: but this\nlast is complete as lacking nothing to the result proposed; whereas\nthat of the basement, or of the triglyph, is incomplete, because each\nis a Movement of a part merely).\nAs I said then, they differ in kind, and you cannot at any time you\nchoose find a Movement complete in its whole nature, but, if at all, in\nthe whole time requisite.\nAnd so it is with the Movement of walking and all others: for, if\nmotion be a Movement from one place to another place, then of it too\nthere are different kinds, flying, walking, leaping, and such-like. And\nnot only so, but there are different kinds even in walking: the\nwhere-from and where-to are not the same in the whole Course as in a\nportion of it; nor in one portion as in another; nor is crossing this\nline the same as crossing that: because a man is not merely crossing a\nline but a line in a given place, and this is in a different place from\nthat.\nOf Movement I have discoursed exactly in another treatise. I will now\ntherefore only say that it seems not to be complete at any given\nmoment; and that most movements are incomplete and specifically\ndifferent, since the whence and whither constitute different species.\nBut of Pleasure the whole nature is complete at any given moment: it is\nplain then that Pleasure and Movement must be different from one\nanother, and that Pleasure belongs to the class of things whole and\ncomplete. And this might appear also from the impossibility of moving\nexcept in a definite time, whereas there is none with respect to the\nsensation of Pleasure, for what exists at the very present moment is a\nkind of \u201cwhole.\u201d\nFrom these considerations then it is plain that people are not\nwarranted in saying that Pleasure is a Movement or a Generation:\nbecause these terms are not applicable to all things, only to such as\nare divisible and not \u201cwholes:\u201d I mean that of an act of Sight there is\nno Generation, nor is there of a point, nor of a monad, nor is any one\nof these a Movement or a Generation: neither then of Pleasure is there\nMovement or Generation, because it is, as one may say, \u201ca whole.\u201d[11]\nChapter IV.\nNow since every Percipient Faculty works upon the Object answering to\nit, and perfectly the Faculty in a good state upon the most excellent\nof the Objects within its range (for Perfect Working is thought to be\nmuch what I have described; and we will not raise any question about\nsaying \u201cthe Faculty\u201d works, instead of, \u201cthat subject wherein the\nFaculty resides\u201d), in each case the best Working is that of the Faculty\nin its best state upon the best of the Objects answering to it. And\nthis will be, further, most perfect and most pleasant: for Pleasure is\nattendant upon every Percipient Faculty, and in like manner on every\nintellectual operation and speculation; and that is most pleasant which\nis most perfect, and that most perfect which is the Working of the best\nFaculty upon the most excellent of the Objects within its range.\nAnd Pleasure perfects the Working. But Pleasure does not perfect it in\nthe same way as the Faculty and Object of Perception do, being good;\njust as health and the physician are not in similar senses causes of a\nhealthy state.\nAnd that Pleasure does arise upon the exercise of every Percipient\nFaculty is evident, for we commonly say that sights and sounds are\npleasant; it is plain also that this is especially the case when the\nFaculty is most excellent and works upon a similar Object: and when\nboth the Object and Faculty of Perception are such, Pleasure will\nalways exist, supposing of course an agent and a patient.\nFurthermore, Pleasure perfects the act of Working not in the way of an\ninherent state but as a supervening finish, such as is bloom in people\nat their prime. Therefore so long as the Object of intellectual or\nsensitive Perception is such as it should be and also the Faculty which\ndiscerns or realises the Object, there will be Pleasure in the Working:\nbecause when that which has the capacity of being acted on and that\nwhich is apt to act are alike and similarly related, the same result\nfollows naturally.\nHow is it then that no one feels Pleasure continuously? is it not that\nhe wearies, because all human faculties are incapable of unintermitting\nexertion; and so, of course, Pleasure does not arise either, because\nthat follows upon the act of Working. But there are some things which\nplease when new, but afterwards not in the like way, for exactly the\nsame reason: that at first the mind is roused and works on these\nObjects with its powers at full tension; just as they who are gazing\nstedfastly at anything; but afterwards the act of Working is not of the\nkind it was at first, but careless, and so the Pleasure too is dulled.\nAgain, a person may conclude that all men grasp at Pleasure, because\nall aim likewise at Life and Life is an act of Working, and every man\nworks at and with those things which also he best likes; the musical\nman, for instance, works with his hearing at music; the studious man\nwith his intellect at speculative questions, and so forth. And Pleasure\nperfects the acts of Working, and so Life after which men grasp. No\nwonder then that they aim also at Pleasure, because to each it perfects\nLife, which is itself choice-worthy. (We will take leave to omit the\nquestion whether we choose Life for Pleasure\u2019s sake of Pleasure for\nLife\u2019s sake; because these two plainly are closely connected and admit\nnot of separation; since Pleasure comes not into being without Working,\nand again, every Working Pleasure perfects.)\nAnd this is one reason why Pleasures are thought to differ in kind,\nbecause we suppose that things which differ in kind must be perfected\nby things so differing: it plainly being the case with the productions\nof Nature and Art; as animals, and trees, and pictures, and statues,\nand houses, and furniture; and so we suppose that in like manner acts\nof Working which are different in kind are perfected by things\ndiffering in kind. Now Intellectual Workings differ specifically from\nthose of the Senses, and these last from one another; therefore so do\nthe Pleasures which perfect them.\nThis may be shown also from the intimate connection subsisting between\neach Pleasure and the Working which it perfects: I mean, that the\nPleasure proper to any Working increases that Working; for they who\nwork with Pleasure sift all things more closely and carry them out to a\ngreater degree of nicety; for instance, those men become geometricians\nwho take Pleasure in geometry, and they apprehend particular points\nmore completely: in like manner men who are fond of music, or\narchitecture, or anything else, improve each on his own pursuit,\nbecause they feel Pleasure in them. Thus the Pleasures aid in\nincreasing the Workings, and things which do so aid are proper and\npeculiar: but the things which are proper and peculiar to others\nspecifically different are themselves also specifically different.\nYet even more clearly may this be shown from the fact that the\nPleasures arising from one kind of Workings hinder other Workings; for\ninstance, people who are fond of flute-music cannot keep their\nattention to conversation or discourse when they catch the sound of a\nflute; because they take more Pleasure in flute-playing than in the\nWorking they are at the time engaged on; in other words, the Pleasure\nattendant on flute-playing destroys the Working of conversation or\ndiscourse.\nMuch the same kind of thing takes place in other cases, when a person\nis engaged in two different Workings at the same time: that is, the\npleasanter of the two keeps pushing out the other, and, if the\ndisparity in pleasantness be great, then more and more till a man even\nceases altogether to work at the other.\nThis is the reason why, when we are very much pleased with anything\nwhatever, we do nothing else, and it is only when we are but moderately\npleased with one occupation that we vary it with another: people, for\ninstance, who eat sweetmeats in the theatre do so most when the\nperformance is indifferent.\nSince then the proper and peculiar Pleasure gives accuracy to the\nWorkings and makes them more enduring and better of their kind, while\nthose Pleasures which are foreign to them mar them, it is plain there\nis a wide difference between them: in fact, Pleasures foreign to any\nWorking have pretty much the same effect as the Pains proper to it,[12]\nwhich, in fact, destroy the Workings; I mean, if one man dislikes\nwriting, or another calculation, the one does not write, the other does\nnot calculate; because, in each case, the Working is attended with some\nPain: so then contrary effects are produced upon the Workings by the\nPleasures and Pains proper to them, by which I mean those which arise\nupon the Working, in itself, independently of any other circumstances.\nAs for the Pleasures foreign to a Working, we have said already that\nthey produce a similar effect to the Pain proper to it; that is they\ndestroy the Working, only not in like way.\nWell then, as Workings differ from one another in goodness and badness,\nsome being fit objects of choice, others of avoidance, and others in\ntheir nature indifferent, Pleasures are similarly related; since its\nown proper Pleasure attends or each Working: of course that proper to a\ngood Working is good, that proper to a bad, bad: for even the desires\nfor what is noble are praiseworthy, and for what is base blameworthy.\nFurthermore, the Pleasures attendant on Workings are more closely\nconnected with them even than the desires after them: for these last\nare separate both in time and nature, but the former are close to the\nWorkings, and so indivisible from them as to raise a question whether\nthe Working and the Pleasure are identical; but Pleasure does not seem\nto be an Intellectual Operation nor a Faculty of Perception, because\nthat is absurd; but yet it gives some the impression of being the same\nfrom not being separated from these.\nAs then the Workings are different so are their Pleasures; now Sight\ndiffers from Touch in purity, and Hearing and Smelling from Taste;\ntherefore, in like manner, do their Pleasures; and again, Intellectual\nPleasures from these Sensual, and the different kinds both of\nIntellectual and Sensual from one another.\nIt is thought, moreover, that each animal has a Pleasure proper to\nitself, as it has a proper Work; that Pleasure of course which is\nattendant on the Working. And the soundness of this will appear upon\nparticular inspection: for horse, dog, and man have different\nPleasures; as Heraclitus says, an ass would sooner have hay than gold;\nin other words, provender is pleasanter to asses than gold. So then the\nPleasures of animals specifically different are also specifically\ndifferent, but those of the same, we may reasonably suppose, are\nwithout difference.\nYet in the case of human creatures they differ not a little: for the\nvery same things please some and pain others: and what are painful and\nhateful to some are pleasant to and liked by others. The same is the\ncase with sweet things: the same will not seem so to the man in a fever\nas to him who is in health: nor will the invalid and the person in\nrobust health have the same notion of warmth. The same is the case with\nother things also.\nNow in all such cases that is held to _be_ which impresses the good man\nwith the notion of being such and such; and if this is a second maxim\n(as it is usually held to be), and Virtue, that is, the Good man, in\nthat he is such, is the measure of everything, then those must be real\nPleasures which gave him the impression of being so and those things\npleasant in which he takes Pleasure. Nor is it at all astonishing that\nwhat are to him unpleasant should give another person the impression of\nbeing pleasant, for men are liable to many corruptions and marrings;\nand the things in question are not pleasant really, only to these\nparticular persons, and to them only as being thus disposed.\nWell of course, you may say, it is obvious that we must assert those\nwhich are confessedly disgraceful to be real Pleasures, except to\ndepraved tastes: but of those which are thought to be good what kind,\nor which, must we say is _The Pleasure of Man?_ is not the answer plain\nfrom considering the Workings, because the Pleasures follow upon these?\nIf then there be one or several Workings which belong to the perfect\nand blessed man, the Pleasures which perfect these Workings must be\nsaid to be specially and properly _The Pleasures of Man;_ and all the\nrest in a secondary sense, and in various degrees according as the\nWorkings are related to those highest and best ones.\nChapter V.\nNow that we have spoken about the Excellences of both kinds, and\nFriendship in its varieties, and Pleasures, it remains to sketch out\nHappiness, since we assume that to be the one End of all human things:\nand we shall save time and trouble by recapitulating what was stated\nbefore.\nWell then, we said that it is not a State merely; because, if it were,\nit might belong to one who slept all his life through and merely\nvegetated, or to one who fell into very great calamities: and so, if\nthese possibilities displease us and we would rather put it into the\nrank of some kind of Working (as was also said before), and Workings\nare of different kinds (some being necessary and choice-worthy with a\nview to other things, while others are so in themselves), it is plain\nwe must rank Happiness among those choice-worthy for their own sakes\nand not among those which are so with a view to something further:\nbecause Happiness has no lack of anything but is self-sufficient.\nBy choice-worthy in themselves are meant those from which nothing is\nsought beyond the act of Working: and of this kind are thought to be\nthe actions according to Virtue, because doing what is noble and\nexcellent is one of those things which are choice-worthy for their own\nsake alone.\nAnd again, such amusements as are pleasant; because people do not\nchoose them with any further purpose: in fact they receive more harm\nthan profit from them, neglecting their persons and their property.\nStill the common run of those who are judged happy take refuge in such\npastimes, which is the reason why they who have varied talent in such\nare highly esteemed among despots; because they make themselves\npleasant in those things which these aim at, and these accordingly want\nsuch men.\nNow these things are thought to be appurtenances of Happiness because\nmen in power spend their leisure herein: yet, it may be, we cannot\nargue from the example of such men: because there is neither Virtue nor\nIntellect necessarily involved in having power, and yet these are the\nonly sources of good Workings: nor does it follow that because these\nmen, never having tasted pure and generous Pleasure, take refuge in\nbodily ones, we are therefore to believe them to be more choice-worthy:\nfor children too believe that those things are most excellent which are\nprecious in their eyes.\nWe may well believe that as children and men have different ideas as to\nwhat is precious so too have the bad and the good: therefore, as we\nhave many times said, those things are really precious and pleasant\nwhich seem so to the good man: and as to each individual that Working\nis most choice-worthy which is in accordance with his own state to the\ngood man that is so which is in accordance with Virtue.\nHappiness then stands not in amusement; in fact the very notion is\nabsurd of the End being amusement, and of one\u2019s toiling and enduring\nhardness all one\u2019s life long with a view to amusement: for everything\nin the world, so to speak, we choose with some further End in view,\nexcept Happiness, for that is the End comprehending all others. Now to\ntake pains and to labour with a view to amusement is plainly foolish\nand very childish: but to amuse one\u2019s self with a view to steady\nemployment afterwards, as Anacharsis says, is thought to be right: for\namusement is like rest, and men want rest because unable to labour\ncontinuously.\nRest, therefore, is not an End, because it is adopted with a view to\nWorking afterwards.\nAgain, it is held that the Happy Life must be one in the way of\nExcellence, and this is accompanied by earnestness,[13] and stands not\nin amusement. Moreover those things which are done in earnest, we say,\nare better than things merely ludicrous and joined with amusement: and\nwe say that the Working of the better part, or the better man, is more\nearnest; and the Working of the better is at once better and more\ncapable of Happiness.\nThen, again, as for bodily Pleasures, any ordinary person, or even a\nslave, might enjoy them, just as well as the best man living but\nHappiness no one supposes a slave to share except so far as it is\nimplied in life: because Happiness stands not in such pastimes but in\nthe Workings in the way of Excellence, as has also been stated before.\nChapter VI.\nNow if Happiness is a Working in the way of Excellence of course that\nExcellence must be the highest, that is to say, the Excellence of the\nbest Principle. Whether then this best Principle is Intellect or some\nother which is thought naturally to rule and to lead and to conceive of\nnoble and divine things, whether being in its own nature divine or the\nmost divine of all our internal Principles, the Working of this in\naccordance with its own proper Excellence must be the perfect\nHappiness.\nThat it is Contemplative has been already stated: and this would seem\nto be consistent with what we said before and with truth: for, in the\nfirst place, this Working is of the highest kind, since the Intellect\nis the highest of our internal Principles and the subjects with which\nit is conversant the highest of all which fall within the range of our\nknowledge.\nNext, it is also most Continuous: for we are better able to contemplate\nthan to do anything else whatever, continuously.\nAgain, we think Pleasure must be in some way an ingredient in\nHappiness, and of all Workings in accordance with Excellence that in\nthe way of Science is confessedly most pleasant: at least the pursuit\nof Science is thought to contain Pleasures admirable for purity and\npermanence; and it is reasonable to suppose that the employment is more\npleasant to those who have mastered, than to those who are yet seeking\nfor, it.[14]\nAnd the Self-Sufficiency which people speak of will attach chiefly to\nthe Contemplative Working: of course the actual necessaries of life are\nneeded alike by the man of science, and the just man, and all the other\ncharacters; but, supposing all sufficiently supplied with these, the\njust man needs people towards whom, and in concert with whom, to\npractise his justice; and in like manner the man of perfected\nself-mastery, and the brave man, and so on of the rest; whereas the man\nof science can contemplate and speculate even when quite alone, and the\nmore entirely he deserves the appellation the more able is he to do so:\nit may be he can do better for having fellow-workers but still he is\ncertainly most Self-Sufficient.\nAgain, this alone would seem to be rested in for its own sake, since\nnothing results from it beyond the fact of having contemplated; whereas\nfrom all things which are objects of moral action we do mean to get\nsomething beside the doing them, be the same more or less.\nAlso, Happiness is thought to stand in perfect rest;[15] for we toil\nthat we may rest, and war that we may be at peace. Now all the\nPractical Virtues require either society or war for their Working, and\nthe actions regarding these are thought to exclude rest; those of war\nentirely, because no one chooses war, nor prepares for war, for war\u2019s\nsake: he would indeed be thought a bloodthirsty villain who should make\nenemies of his friends to secure the existence of fighting and\nbloodshed. The Working also of the statesman excludes the idea of rest,\nand, beside the actual work of government, seeks for power and\ndignities or at least Happiness for the man himself and his\nfellow-citizens: a Happiness distinct[16] from the national Happiness,\nwhich we evidently seek as being different and distinct.\nIf then of all the actions in accordance with the various virtues those\nof policy and war are pre-eminent in honour and greatness, and these\nare restless, and aim at some further End and are not choice-worthy for\ntheir own sakes, but the Working of the Intellect, being apt for\ncontemplation, is thought to excel in earnestness, and to aim at no End\nbeyond itself and to have Pleasure of its own which helps to increase\nthe Working, and if the attributes of Self-Sufficiency, and capacity of\nrest, and unweariedness (as far as is compatible with the infirmity of\nhuman nature), and all other attributes of the highest Happiness,\nplainly belong to this Working, this must be perfect Happiness, if\nattaining a complete duration of life, which condition is added because\nnone of the points of Happiness is incomplete.\nBut such a life will be higher than mere human nature, because a man\nwill live thus, not in so far as he is man but in so far as there is in\nhim a divine Principle: and in proportion as this Principle excels his\ncomposite nature so far does the Working thereof excel that in\naccordance with any other kind of Excellence: and therefore, if pure\nIntellect, as compared with human nature, is divine, so too will the\nlife in accordance with it be divine compared with man\u2019s ordinary life.\nYet must we not give ear to those who bid one as man to mind only man\u2019s\naffairs, or as mortal only mortal things; but, so far as we can, make\nourselves like immortals and do all with a view to living in accordance\nwith the highest Principle in us, for small as it may be in bulk yet in\npower and preciousness it far more excels all the others.\nIn fact this Principle would seem to constitute each man\u2019s \u201cSelf,\u201d\nsince it is supreme and above all others in goodness it _would_ be\nabsurd then for a man not to choose his own life but that of some\nother.\nAnd here will apply an observation made before, that whatever is proper\nto each is naturally best and pleasantest to him: such then is to Man\nthe life in accordance with pure Intellect (since this Principle is\nmost truly Man), and if so, then it is also the happiest.\nAnd second in degree of Happiness will be that Life which is in\naccordance with the other kind of Excellence, for the Workings in\naccordance with this are proper to Man: I mean, we do actions of\njustice, courage, and the other virtues, towards one another, in\ncontracts, services of different kinds, and in all kinds of actions and\nfeelings too, by observing what is befitting for each: and all these\nplainly are proper to man. Further, the Excellence of the Moral\ncharacter is thought to result in some points from physical\ncircumstances, and to be, in many, very closely connected with the\npassions.\nAgain, Practical Wisdom[17] and Excellence of the Moral character are\nvery closely united; since the Principles of Practical Wisdom are in\naccordance with the Moral Virtues and these are right when they accord\nwith Practical Wisdom.\nThese moreover, as bound up with the passions, must belong to the\ncomposite nature, and the Excellences or Virtues of the composite\nnature are proper to man: therefore so too will be the life and\nHappiness which is in accordance with them. But that of the Pure\nIntellect is separate and distinct: and let this suffice upon the\nsubject, since great exactness is beyond our purpose,\nIt would seem, moreover, to require supply of external goods to a small\ndegree, or certainly less than the Moral Happiness: for, as far as\nnecessaries of life are concerned, we will suppose both characters to\nneed them equally (though, in point of fact, the man who lives in\nsociety does take more pains about his person and all that kind of\nthing; there will really be some little difference), but when we come\nto consider their Workings there will be found a great difference.\nI mean, the liberal man must have money to do his liberal actions with,\nand the just man to meet his engagements (for mere intentions are\nuncertain, and even those who are unjust make a pretence of _wishing_\nto do justly), and the brave man must have power, if he is to perform\nany of the actions which appertain to his particular Virtue, and the\nman of perfected self-mastery must have opportunity of temptation, else\nhow shall he or any of the others display his real character?\n(By the way, a question is sometimes raised, whether the moral choice\nor the actions have most to do with Virtue, since it consists in both:\nit is plain that the perfection of virtuous action requires both: but\nfor the actions many things are required, and the greater and more\nnumerous they are the more.) But as for the man engaged in\nContemplative Speculation, not only are such things unnecessary for his\nWorking, but, so to speak, they are even hindrances: as regards the\nContemplation at least; because of course in so far as he is Man and\nlives in society he chooses to do what Virtue requires, and so he will\nneed such things for maintaining his character as Man though not as a\nspeculative philosopher.\nAnd that the perfect Happiness must be a kind of Contemplative Working\nmay appear also from the following consideration: our conception of the\ngods is that they are above all blessed and happy: now what kind of\nMoral actions are we to attribute to them? those of justice? nay, will\nthey not be set in a ridiculous light if represented as forming\ncontracts, and restoring deposits, and so on? well then, shall we\npicture them performing brave actions, withstanding objects of fear and\nmeeting dangers, because it is noble to do so? or liberal ones? but to\nwhom shall they be giving? and further, it is absurd to think they have\nmoney or anything of the kind. And as for actions of perfected\nself-mastery, what can theirs be? would it not be a degrading praise\nthat they have no bad desires? In short, if one followed the subject\ninto all details all the circumstances connected with Moral actions\nwould appear trivial and unworthy of Gods.\nStill, every one believes that they live, and therefore that they Work\nbecause it is not supposed that they sleep their time away like\nEndymion: now if from a living being you take away Action, still more\nif Creation, what remains but Contemplation? So then the Working of the\nGods, eminent in blessedness, will be one apt for Contemplative\nSpeculation; and of all human Workings that will have the greatest\ncapacity for Happiness which is nearest akin to this.\nA corroboration of which position is the fact that the other animals do\nnot partake of Happiness, being completely shut out from any such\nWorking.\nTo the Gods then all their life is blessed; and to men in so far as\nthere is in it some copy of such Working, but of the other animals none\nis happy because it in no way shares in Contemplative Speculation.\nHappiness then is co-extensive with this Contemplative Speculation, and\nin proportion as people have the act of Contemplation so far have they\nalso the being happy, not incidentally, but in the way of Contemplative\nSpeculation because it is in itself precious.\nChapter VII.\nSo Happiness must be a kind of Contemplative Speculation; but since it\nis Man we are speaking of he will need likewise External Prosperity,\nbecause his Nature is not by itself sufficient for Speculation, but\nthere must be health of body, and nourishment, and tendance of all\nkinds.\nHowever, it must not be thought, because without external goods a man\ncannot enjoy high Happiness, that therefore he will require many and\ngreat goods in order to be happy: for neither Self-sufficiency, nor\nAction, stand in Excess, and it is quite possible to act nobly without\nbeing ruler of sea and land, since even with moderate means a man may\nact in accordance with Virtue.\nAnd this may be clearly seen in that men in private stations are\nthought to act justly, not merely no less than men in power but even\nmore: it will be quite enough that just so much should belong to a man\nas is necessary, for his life will be happy who works in accordance\nwith Virtue.\nSolon perhaps drew a fair picture of the Happy, when he said that they\nare men moderately supplied with external goods, and who have achieved\nthe most noble deeds, as he thought, and who have lived with perfect\nself-mastery: for it is quite possible for men of moderate means to act\nas they ought.\nAnaxagoras also seems to have conceived of the Happy man not as either\nrich or powerful, saying that he should not wonder if he were accounted\na strange man in the judgment of the multitude: for they judge by\noutward circumstances of which alone they have any perception.\nAnd thus the opinions of the Wise seem to be accordant with our account\nof the matter: of course such things carry some weight, but truth, in\nmatters of moral action, is judged from facts and from actual life, for\nherein rests the decision. So what we should do is to examine the\npreceding statements by referring them to facts and to actual life, and\nwhen they harmonise with facts we may accept them, when they are at\nvariance with them conceive of them as mere theories.\nNow he that works in accordance with, and pays observance to, Pure\nIntellect, and tends this, seems likely to be both in the best frame of\nmind and dearest to the Gods: because if, as is thought, any care is\nbestowed on human things by the Gods then it must be reasonable to\nthink that they take pleasure in what is best and most akin to\nthemselves (and this must be the Pure Intellect); and that they requite\nwith kindness those who love and honour this most, as paying observance\nto what is dear to them, and as acting rightly and nobly. And it is\nquite obvious that the man of Science chiefly combines all these: he is\ntherefore dearest to the Gods, and it is probable that he is at the\nsame time most Happy.\nThus then on this view also the man of Science will be most Happy.\nChapter VIII.\nNow then that we have said enough in our sketchy kind of way on these\nsubjects; I mean, on the Virtues, and also on Friendship and Pleasure;\nare we to suppose that our original purpose is completed? Must we not\nrather acknowledge, what is commonly said, that in matters of moral\naction mere Speculation and Knowledge is not the real End but rather\nPractice: and if so, then neither in respect of Virtue is Knowledge\nenough; we must further strive to have and exert it, and take whatever\nother means there are of becoming good.\nNow if talking and writing were of themselves sufficient to make men\ngood, they would justly, as Theognis observes have reaped numerous and\ngreat rewards, and the thing to do would be to provide them: but in\npoint of fact, while they plainly have the power to guide and stimulate\nthe generous among the young and to base upon true virtuous principle\nany noble and truly high-minded disposition, they as plainly are\npowerless to guide the mass of men to Virtue and goodness; because it\nis not their nature to be amenable to a sense of shame but only to\nfear; nor to abstain from what is low and mean because it is\ndisgraceful to do it but because of the punishment attached to it: in\nfact, as they live at the beck and call of passion, they pursue their\nown proper pleasures and the means of securing them, and they avoid the\ncontrary pains; but as for what is noble and truly pleasurable they\nhave not an idea of it, inasmuch as they have never tasted of it.\nMen such as these then what mere words can transform? No, indeed! it is\neither actually impossible, or a task of no mean difficulty, to alter\nby words what has been of old taken into men\u2019s very dispositions: and,\nit may be, it is a ground for contentment if with all the means and\nappliances for goodness in our hands we can attain to Virtue.\nThe formation of a virtuous character some ascribe to Nature, some to\nCustom, and some to Teaching. Now Nature\u2019s part, be it what it may,\nobviously does not rest with us, but belongs to those who in the truest\nsense are fortunate, by reason of certain divine agency,\nThen, as for Words and Precept, they, it is to be feared, will not\navail with all; but it may be necessary for the mind of the disciple to\nhave been previously prepared for liking and disliking as he ought;\njust as the soil must, to nourish the seed sown. For he that lives in\nobedience to passion cannot hear any advice that would dissuade him,\nnor, if he heard, understand: now him that is thus how can one reform?\nin fact, generally, passion is not thought to yield to Reason but to\nbrute force. So then there must be, to begin with, a kind of affinity\nto Virtue in the disposition; which must cleave to what is honourable\nand loath what is disgraceful. But to get right guidance towards Virtue\nfrom the earliest youth is not easy unless one is brought up under laws\nof such kind; because living with self-mastery and endurance is not\npleasant to the mass of men, and specially not to the young. For this\nreason the food, and manner of living generally, ought to be the\nsubject of legal regulation, because things when become habitual will\nnot be disagreeable.\nYet perhaps it is not sufficient that men while young should get right\nfood and tendance, but, inasmuch as they will have to practise and\nbecome accustomed to certain things even after they have attained to\nman\u2019s estate, we shall want laws on these points as well, and, in fine,\nrespecting one\u2019s whole life, since the mass of men are amenable to\ncompulsion rather than Reason, and to punishment rather than to a sense\nof honour.\nAnd therefore some men hold that while lawgivers should employ the\nsense of honour to exhort and guide men to Virtue, under the notion\nthat they will then obey who have been well trained in habits; they\nshould impose chastisement and penalties on those who disobey and are\nof less promising nature; and the incurable expel entirely: because the\ngood man and he who lives under a sense of honour will be obedient to\nreason; and the baser sort, who grasp at pleasure, will be kept in\ncheck, like beasts of burthen by pain. Therefore also they say that the\npains should be such as are most contrary to the pleasures which are\nliked.\nAs has been said already, he who is to be good must have been brought\nup and habituated well, and then live accordingly under good\ninstitutions, and never do what is low and mean, either against or with\nhis will. Now these objects can be attained only by men living in\naccordance with some guiding Intellect and right order, with power to\nback them.\nAs for the Paternal Rule, it possesses neither strength nor compulsory\npower, nor in fact does the Rule of any one man, unless he is a king or\nsome one in like case: but the Law has power to compel, since it is a\ndeclaration emanating from Practical Wisdom and Intellect. And people\nfeel enmity towards their fellow-men who oppose their impulses, however\nrightly they may do so: the Law, on the contrary, is not the object of\nhatred, though enforcing right rules.\nThe Laced\u00e6monian is nearly the only State in which the framer of the\nConstitution has made any provision, it would seem, respecting the food\nand manner of living of the people: in most States these points are\nentirely neglected, and each man lives just as he likes, ruling his\nwife and children Cyclops-Fashion.\nOf course, the best thing would be that there should be a right Public\nSystem and that we should be able to carry it out: but, since as a\npublic matter those points are neglected, the duty would seem to\ndevolve upon each individual to contribute to the cause of Virtue with\nhis own children and friends, or at least to make this his aim and\npurpose: and this, it would seem, from what has been said, he will be\nbest able to do by making a Legislator of himself: since all public\nsystems, it is plain, are formed by the instrumentality of laws and\nthose are good which are formed by that of good laws: whether they are\nwritten or unwritten, whether they are applied to the training of one\nor many, will not, it seems, make any difference, just as it does not\nin music, gymnastics, or any other such accomplishments, which are\ngained by practice.\nFor just as in Communities laws and customs prevail, so too in families\nthe express commands of the Head, and customs also: and even more in\nthe latter, because of blood-relationship and the benefits conferred:\nfor there you have, to begin with, people who have affection and are\nnaturally obedient to the authority which controls them.\nThen, furthermore, Private training has advantages over Public, as in\nthe case of the healing art: for instance, as a general rule, a man who\nis in a fever should keep quiet, and starve; but in a particular case,\nperhaps, this may not hold good; or, to take a different illustration,\nthe boxer will not use the same way of fighting with all antagonists.\nIt would seem then that the individual will be most exactly attended to\nunder Private care, because so each will be more likely to obtain what\nis expedient for him. Of course, whether in the art of healing, or\ngymnastics, or any other, a man will treat individual cases the better\nfor being acquainted with general rules; as, \u201cthat so and so is good\nfor all, or for men in such and such cases:\u201d because general maxims are\nnot only said to be but are the object-matter of sciences: still this\nis no reason against the possibility of a man\u2019s taking excellent care\nof some _one_ case, though he possesses no scientific knowledge but\nfrom experience is exactly acquainted with what happens in each point;\njust as some people are thought to doctor themselves best though they\nwould be wholly unable to administer relief to others. Yet it may seem\nto be necessary nevertheless, for one who wishes to become a real\nartist and well acquainted with the theory of his profession, to have\nrecourse to general principles and ascertain all their capacities: for\nwe have already stated that these are the object-matter of sciences.\nIf then it appears that we may become good through the instrumentality\nof laws, of course whoso wishes to make men better by a system of care\nand training must try to make a Legislator of himself; for to treat\nskilfully just any one who may be put before you is not what any\nordinary person can do, but, if any one, he who has knowledge; as in\nthe healing art, and all others which involve careful practice and\nskill.\nWill not then our next business be to enquire from what sources, or how\none may acquire this faculty of Legislation; or shall we say, that, as\nin similar cases, Statesmen are the people to learn from, since this\nfaculty was thought to be a part of the Social Science? Must we not\nadmit that the Political Science plainly does not stand on a similar\nfooting to that of other sciences and faculties? I mean, that while in\nall other cases those who impart the faculties and themselves exert\nthem are identical (physicians and painters for instance) matters of\nStatesmanship the Sophists profess to teach, but not one of them\npractises it, that being left to those actually engaged in it: and\nthese might really very well be thought to do it by some singular knack\nand by mere practice rather than by any intellectual process: for they\nneither write nor speak on these matters (though it might be more to\ntheir credit than composing speeches for the courts or the assembly),\nnor again have they made Statesmen of their own sons or their friends.\nOne can hardly suppose but that they would have done so if they could,\nseeing that they could have bequeathed no more precious legacy to their\ncommunities, nor would they have preferred, for themselves or their\ndearest friends, the possession of any faculty rather than this.\nPractice, however, seems to contribute no little to its acquisition;\nmerely breathing the atmosphere of politics would never have made\nStatesmen of them, and therefore we may conclude that they who would\nacquire a knowledge of Statesmanship must have in addition practice.\nBut of the Sophists they who profess to teach it are plainly a long way\noff from doing so: in fact, they have no knowledge at all of its nature\nand objects; if they had, they would never have put it on the same\nfooting with Rhetoric or even on a lower: neither would they have\nconceived it to be \u201can easy matter to legislate by simply collecting\nsuch laws as are famous because of course one could select the best,\u201d\nas though the selection were not a matter of skill, and the judging\naright a very great matter, as in Music: for they alone, who have\npractical knowledge of a thing, can judge the performances rightly or\nunderstand with what means and in what way they are accomplished, and\nwhat harmonises with what: the unlearned must be content with being\nable to discover whether the result is good or bad, as in painting.\nNow laws may be called the performances or tangible results of\nPolitical Science; how then can a man acquire from these the faculty of\nLegislation, or choose the best? we do not see men made physicians by\ncompilations: and yet in these treatises men endeavour to give not only\nthe cases but also how they may be cured, and the proper treatment in\neach case, dividing the various bodily habits. Well, these are thought\nto be useful to professional men, but to the unprofessional useless. In\nlike manner it may be that collections of laws and Constitutions would\nbe exceedingly useful to such as are able to speculate on them, and\njudge what is well, and what ill, and what kind of things fit in with\nwhat others: but they who without this qualification should go through\nsuch matters cannot have right judgment, unless they have it by\ninstinct, though they may become more intelligent in such matters.\nSince then those who have preceded us have left uninvestigated the\nsubject of Legislation, it will be better perhaps for us to investigate\nit ourselves, and, in fact, the whole subject of Polity, that thus what\nwe may call Human Philosophy may be completed as far as in us lies.\nFirst then, let us endeavour to get whatever fragments of good there\nmay be in the statements of our predecessors, next, from the Polities\nwe have collected, ascertain what kind of things preserve or destroy\nCommunities, and what, particular Constitutions; and the cause why some\nare well and others ill managed, for after such enquiry, we shall be\nthe better able to take a concentrated view as to what kind of\nConstitution is best, what kind of regulations are best for each, and\nwhat laws and customs.\nNOTES\nBOOK I\n[1] For this term, as here employed, our language contains no\nequivalent expression except an inconvenient paraphrase.\nThere are three senses which it bears in this treatise: the first (in\nwhich it is here employed) is its strict etymological signfication \u201cThe\nscience of Society,\u201d and this includes everything which can bear at all\nupon the well-being of Man in his social capacity, \u201cQuicquid agunt\nhomines nostri est farrago libelli.\u201d It is in this view that it is\nfairly denominated most commanding and inclusive.\nThe second sense (in which it occurs next, just below) is \u201cMoral\nPhilosophy.\u201d Aristotle explains the term in this sense in the Rhetoric\n(1 2) [Greek: hae peri ta aethae pragmateia aen dikaion esti\nprosagoreuen politikaen]. He has principally in view in this treatise\nthe moral training of the Individual, the branch of the Science of\nSociety which we call Ethics Proper, bearing the same relation to the\nlarger Science as the hewing and squaring of the stones to the building\nof the Temple, or the drill of the Recruit to the manoeuvres of the\nfield. Greek Philosophy viewed men principally as constituent parts of\na [Greek: polis], considering this function to be the real End of each,\nand this state as that in which the Individual attained his highest and\nmost complete development.\nThe third sense is \u201cThe detail of Civil Government,\u201d which Aristotle\nexpressly states (vi. 8) was the most common acceptation of the term.\n[2] Matters of which a man is to judge either belong to some\ndefinite art or science, or they do not. In the former case he is the\nbest judge who has thorough acquaintance with that art or science, in\nthe latter, the man whose powers have been developed and matured by\neducation. A lame horse one would show to a farmer, not to the best and\nwisest man of one\u2019s acquaintance; to the latter, one would apply in a\ndifficult case of conduct.\nExperience answers to the first, a state of self-control to the latter.\n[3] In the last chapter of the third book of this treatise it\nis said of the fool, that his desire of pleasure is not only\ninsatiable, but indiscriminate in its objects, \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd.\n[4] \u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u1f74 is a word used in this treatise in various significations. The\nprimary one is \u201cbeginning or first cause,\u201d and this runs through all\nits various uses.\n\u201cRule,\u201d and sometimes \u201cRulers,\u201d are denoted by this term the initiative\nbeing a property of Rule.\n\u201cPrinciple\u201d is a very usual signification of it, and in fact the most\ncharacteristic of the Ethics. The word Principle means\n\u201cstarting-point.\u201d Every action has two beginnings, that of Resolve \u03bf\u1f57\n\u1f15\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1, and that of Action (\u1f45\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2). I desire praise of men this\nthen is the beginning of Resolve. Having considered how it is to be\nattained, I resolve upon some course and this Resolve is the beginning\nof Action.\nThe beginnings of Resolve, \u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u1f76 or Motives, when formally stated, are\nthe major premisses of what Aristotle calls the \u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd\n\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd, i.e. the reasoning into which actions may be analysed.\nThus we say that the desire of human praise was the motive of the\nPharisees, or the principle on which they acted.\nTheir practical syllogism then would stand thus:\nWhatever gains human praise is to be done;\nPublic praying and almsgiving gave human praise:\n[ergo] Public praying and almsgiving are to be done.\nThe major premisses may be stored up in the mind as rules of action,\nand this is what is commonly meant by having principles good or bad.\n[5] The difficulty of this passage consists in determining the\nsignification of the terms [Greek: gnorima aemin] and [Greek: gnorima\naplos]\nI have translated them without reference to their use elsewhere, as\ndenoting respectively what _is_ and what _may_ be known. All truth is\n[Greek: gnorimon aplos], but that alone [Greek: aemin] which we\nindividually realise, therefore those principles alone are [Greek:\ngnorima aemin] which _we have received as true_. From this appears\nimmediately the necessity of good training as preparatory to the study\nof Moral Philosophy for good training in habits will either work\nprinciples into our nature, or make us capable of accepting them as\nsoon as they are put before us; which no mere intellectual training can\ndo. The child who has been used to obey his parents may never have\nheard the fifth Commandment but it is in the very texture of his\nnature, and the first time he hears it he will recognise it as morally\ntrue and right the principle is in his case a fact, the reason for\nwhich he is as little inclined to ask as any one would be able to prove\nits truth if he should ask.\nBut these terms are employed elsewhere (Analytica Post I cap. 11. sect.\n10) to denote respectively particulars and universals The latter are so\ndenominated, because principles or laws must be supposed to have\nexisted before the instances of their operation. Justice must have\nexisted before just actions, Redness before red things, but since what\nwe meet with are the concrete instances (from which we gather the\nprinciples and laws), the particulars are said to be [Greek:\ngnorimotera aemin]\nAdopting this signification gives greater unity to the whole passage,\nwhich will then stand thus. The question being whether we are to assume\nprinciples, or obtain them by an analysis of facts, Aristotle says, \u201cWe\nmust begin of course with what is known but then this term denotes\neither particulars or universals perhaps we then must begin with\nparticulars and hence the necessity of a previous good training in\nhabits, etc. (which of course is beginning with particular facts), for\na fact is a starting point, and if this be sufficiently clear, there\nwill be no want of the reason for the fact in addition\u201d\nThe objection to this method of translation is, that [Greek: archai]\noccurs immediately afterwards in the sense of \u201cprinciples.\u201d\nUtere tuo judicio nihil enim impedio.\n[6] Or \u201cprove themselves good,\u201d as in the Prior Analytics, ii 25,\n[Greek: apanta pisteuomen k.t l] but the other rendering is supported\nby a passage in Book VIII. chap. ix. [Greek: oi d\u2019 upo ton epieikon kai\neidoton oregomenoi timaes bebaiosai ten oikeian doxan ephientai peri\nauton chairousi de oti eisin agathoi, pisteuontes te ton legonton\nkrisei]\n[7] [Greek: thesis] meant originally some paradoxical statement by any\nphilosopher of name enough to venture on one, but had come to mean any\ndialectical question. Topics, I. chap. ix.\n[8] A lost work, supposed to have been so called, because\ncontaining miscellaneous questions.\n[9] It is only quite at the close of the treatise that Aristotle refers\nto this, and allows that [Greek: theoria] constitutes the highest\nhappiness because it is the exercise of the highest faculty in man the\nreason of thus deferring the statement being that till the lower, that\nis the moral, nature has been reduced to perfect order, [Greek:\ntheoria] cannot have place, though, had it been held out from the\nfirst, men would have been for making the experiment at once, without\nthe trouble of self-discipline.\n[10] Or, as some think, \u201cmany theories have been founded on them.\u201d\n[11] The \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 is the archetype, the \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 the concrete embodying the\nresemblance of it; hence Aristotle alludes to the theory under both\nnames, and this is the reason for retaining the Greek terms.\n[12] The list ran thus\u2014\n[Greek:\nto peras     to apeiron      |    to euthu\nto perisson  to artion       |    to phos\nto en        to plethos      |    to tetragonon\nto dexion    to aristeron    |    to aeremoun\nto arren     to thelu        |    to agathon\n]\n[13] Plato\u2019s sister\u2019s son.\n[14] This is the capital defect in Aristotle\u2019s eyes, who being\neminently practical, could not like a theory which not only did not\nnecessarily lead to action, but had a tendency to discourage it by\nenabling unreal men to talk finely. If true, the theory is merely a way\nof stating facts, and leads to no action.\n[15] _i.e._ the identification of Happiness with the Chief Good.\n[16] _i.e._ without the capability of addition.\n[17] And then Happiness would at once be shown not to be the Chief\nGood. It is a contradiction in terms to speak of adding to the Chief\nGood. See Book X. chap. 11. [Greek: delon os oud allo ouden tagathon an\neiae o meta tenos ton kath\u2019 auto agathon airetoteron ginetai.]\n[18] Compare Bishop Butler\u2019s account of \u201cHuman Nature as a System\u201d in\nthe Preface to his Sermons.\n[19] _i.e._ as working or as quiescent.\n[20] The mere translation of this term would convey no idea of its\nmeaning, I have therefore retained the Greek term. It is afterwards\nexplained to include space of time and external appliances requisite\nfor the full development of Man\u2019s energies; here the time only is\nalluded to.\n[21] This principle is more fully stated, with illustrations,\nin the Topics, I. chap. ix.\n[22] Either that of the bodily senses, or that of the moral senses.\n\u201cFire burns,\u201d is an instance of the former, \u201cTreason is odious,\u201d of the\nlatter.\n[23] I have thought it worthwhile to vary the interpretation of this\nword, because though \u201chabitus\u201d may be equivalent to all the senses of\n[Greek: exis], \u201chabit\u201d is not, at least according to our colloquial\nusage we commonly denote by \u201chabit\u201d a state formed by habituation.\n[24] Another and perhaps more obvious method of rendering this passage\nis to apply [Greek: kalon kagathon] to things, and let them depend\ngrammatically on [Greek: epaeboli]. It is to be remembered, however,\nthat [Greek: kalos kagathos] bore a special and well-known meaning also\nthe comparison is in the text more complete, and the point of the\npassage seems more completely brought out.\n[25] \u201cGoodness always implies the love of itself, an affection to\ngoodness.\u201d (Bishop Butler, Sermon xiii ) Aristotle describes pleasure\nin the Tenth Book of this Treatise as the result of any faculty of\nperception meeting with the corresponding object, vicious pleasure\nbeing as truly pleasure as the most refined and exalted. If Goodness\nthen implies the love of itself, the percipient will always have its\nobject present, and pleasure continually result.\n[26] In spite of theory, we know as a matter of fact that external\ncircumstances are necessary to complete the idea of Happiness not that\nHappiness is capable of addition, but that when we assert it to be\nidentical with virtuous action we must understand that it is to have a\nfair field; in fact, the other side of [Greek: bios teleios].\n[27] It is remarkable how Aristotle here again shelves what he\nconsiders an unpractical question. If Happiness were really a direct\ngift from Heaven, independently of human conduct, all motive to\nself-discipline and moral improvement would vanish He shows therefore\nthat it is no depreciation of the value of Happiness to suppose it to\ncome partly at least from ourselves, and he then goes on with other\nreasons why we should think with him.\n[28] This term is important, what has been maimed was once perfect; he\ndoes not contemplate as possible the case of a man being born incapable\nof virtue, and so of happiness.\n[29] [Greek] Plato. Ph\u00e6don. xlvi.\n[30] But why give materials and instruments, if there is no work to do?\n[31] The supposed pair of ancestors.\n[32] Solon says, \u201cCall no man happy till he is dead.\u201d He must mean\neither, The man when dead _is_ happy (a), or, The man when dead _may be\nsaid to have been happy_ (b). If the former, does he mean positive\nhappiness (a)? or only freedom from unhappiness (\u03b2)? _We_ cannot allow\n(a), Men\u2019s opinions disallow (\u03b2), We revert now to the consideration of\n(b).\n[33] The difficulty was raised by the clashing of a notion commonly\nheld, and a fact universally experienced. Most people conceive that\nHappiness should be abiding, every one knows that fortune is\nchangeable. It is the notion which supports the definition, because we\nhave therein based Happiness on the most abiding cause.\n[34] I have taken \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd to refer to \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd, against Magirus\nand the Paraphrase of Andronicus Rhodius. I would refer to Aristotle\u2019s\naccount of \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 in the Tenth Book, chap. vii. where he expressly says\nof the working of \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 or pure intelect, that it is \u201cmost continuous.\u201d\n[35] The term seems to be employed advisedly. The Choragus, of\ncourse, dressed his actors _for their parts;_ not according to their\nfancies or his own.\nHooker has (E. P. v. ixxvi. 5) a passage which seems to be an admirable\nparaphrase on this.\n\u201cAgain, that the measure of our outward prosperity be taken by\nproportion with that which every man\u2019s estate in this present life\nrequireth. External abilities are instruments of action. It contenteth\nwise artificers to have their instruments proportionable to their work,\nrather fit for use than huge and goodly to please the eye. Seeing then\nthe actions of a servant do not need that which may be necessary for\nmen of calling and place in the world, neither men of inferior\ncondition many things which greater personages can hardly want; surely\nthey are blessed in worldly respects who have wherewith to perform what\ntheir station and place asketh, though they have no more.\u201d\n[36] Always bearing in mind that man \u201cnever continueth in one stay.\u201d\n[37] The meaning is this: personal fortunes, we have said, must be in\ncertain weight and number to affect our own happiness, this will be\ntrue, of course, of those which are reflected on us from our friends:\nand these are the only ones to which the dead are supposed to be\nliable? add then the difference of sensibility which it is fair to\npresume, and there is a very small residuum of joy or sorrow.\n[38] This is meant for an exhaustive division of goods, which are\neither so _in esse_ or _in posse_.\nIf _in esse_, they are either above praise, or subjects of praise.\nThose _in posse_, here called faculties, are good only when rightly\nused. Thus Rhetoric is a faculty which may be used to promote justice\nor abused to support villainy. Money in like way.\n[39] The doubt is, whether [Greek] or [Greek] is the subject of the\nsentence. It is translated as above, not merely with reference to the\nsense of this passage, but on a comparison with a similar one in Book\nX. chap 8. [Greek].\n[40] Eudoxus, a philosopher holding the doctrine afterwards adopted by\nEpicurus respecting pleasure, but (as Aristotle testifies in the Tenth\nBook) of irreproachable character.\n[41] See the Rhetoric, Book I. chap ix.\n[42] The unseen is at least as real as the seen.\n[43] The terms are borrowed from the Seventh Book and are here used in\ntheir strict philosophical meaning. The [Greek: enkrates] is he who has\nbad or unruly appetites, but whose reason is strong enough to keep them\nunder. The [Greek: akrates] is he whose appetites constantly prevail\nover his reason and previous good resolutions.\nBy the law of habits the former is constantly approximating to a state\nin which the appetites are wholly quelled. This state is called [Greek:\nsophrosyne], and the man in it [Greek: sophron]. By the same law the\nremonstrances of reason in the latter grow fainter and fainter till\nthey are silenced for ever. This state is called [Greek: akolasia], and\nthe man in it [Greek: akolastos].\n[44] This is untranslateable. As the Greek phrase, [Greek: echein logon\ntinos], really denotes substituting that person\u2019s [Greek: logos] for\none\u2019s own, so the Irrational nature in a man of self-control or\nperfected self-mastery substitutes the orders of Reason for its own\nimpulses. The other phrase means the actual possession of mathematical\ntruths as part of the mental furniture, _i.e._ knowing them.\n[45] [Greek: xin] may be taken as opposed to [Greek: energeian], and\nthe meaning will be, to show a difference between Moral and\nIntellectual Excellences, that men are commended for merely having the\nlatter, but only for exerting and using the former.\nBOOK II\n[1] Which we call simply virtue.\n[2] For nature must of course supply the capacity.\n[3] Or \u201cas a simple result of nature.\u201d\n[4] This is done in the Sixth Book.\n[5] It is, in truth, in the application of rules to particular details\nof practice that our moral Responsibility chiefly lies no rule can be\nso framed, that evasion shall be impossible. See Bishop Butler\u2019s Sermon\non the character of Balaam, and that on Self-Deceit.\n[6] The words \u1f00\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u1f78\u03c2 are not used here in their strict\nsignifications to denote confirmed states of vice: the \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2\nnecessarily feels pain, because he must always be thwarting passions\nwhich are a real part of his nature; though this pain will grow less\nand less as he nears the point of \u03c3\u03c9\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 or perfected Self-Mastery,\nwhich being attained the pain will then and then only cease entirely.\nSo a certain degree of fear is necessary to the _formation_ of true\ncourage. All that is meant here is, that no habit of courage or\nself-mastery can be said to be matured, until pain altogether vanishes.\n[7] Virtue consists in the due regulation of _all_ the parts of our\nnature our passions are a real part of that nature, and as such have\ntheir proper office, it is an error then to aim at their extirpation.\nIt is true that in a perfect moral state emotion will be rare, but then\nthis will have been gained by regular process, being the legitimate\nresult of the law that \u201cpassive impressions weaken as active habits are\nstrengthened, by repetition.\u201d If musical instruments are making\ndiscord, I may silence or I may bring them into harmony in either case\nI get rid of discord, but in the latter I have the positive enjoyment\nof music. The Stoics would have the passions rooted out, Aristotle\nwould have them cultivated to use an apt figure (whose I know not),\nThey would pluck the blossom off at once, he would leave it to fall in\ndue course when the fruit was formed. Of them we might truly say,\n_Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant_. See on this point Bishop\nButler\u2019s fifth Sermon, and sect. 11. of the chapter on Moral Discipline\nin the first part of his Analogy.\n[8] I have adopted this word from our old writers, because our word\n_act_ is so commonly interchanged with _action_. [Greek: Praxis]\n(action) properly denotes the whole process from the conception to the\nperformance. [Greek: Pragma] (fact) only the result. The latter may be\nright when the former is wrong if, for example, a murderer was killed\nby his accomplices. Again, the [Greek: praxis] may be _good_ though the\n[Greek: pragma] be wrong, as if a man under erroneous impressions does\nwhat would have been right if his impressions had been true (subject of\ncourse to the question how far he is guiltless of his original error),\nbut in this case we could not call the [Greek: praxis] _right_. No\nrepetition of [Greek: pragmata] goes to form a habit. See Bishop Butler\non the Theory of Habits m the chapter on Moral Discipline, quoted\nabove, sect. 11. \u201cAnd in like manner as habits belonging to the body,\u201d\netc.\n[9] Being about to give a strict logical definition of Virtue,\nAristotle ascertains first what is its genus [Greek: ti estin].\n[10] That is, not for _merely having_ them, because we did not make\nourselves.\nSee Bishop Butler\u2019s account of our nature as containing \u201cparticular\npropensions,\u201d in sect. iv. of the chapter on Moral discipline, and in\nthe Preface to the Sermons.\n[11] This refers to the division of quantity ([Greek: poson]) in the\nCategories. Those Quantities are called by Aristotle Continuous whose\nparts have position relatively to one another, as a line, surface, or\nsolid, those discrete, whose parts have no such relation, as numbers\nthemselves, or any string of words grammatically unconnected.\n[12] Numbers are in arithmetical proportion (more usually called\nprogression), when they increase or decrease by a common difference\nthus, 2, 6, 10 are so, because 2 + 4 = 6, 6 + 4= 10, or _vice versa_,\n10 - 4 = 6, 6 - 4 = 2.\n[13] If the mina be taken at 15 oz. avoirdupois, (Dict. of G. and R.\nAntiquities, article _Talentum_,) we must be sadly degenerate in our\ngastric capacity.\n[14] The two are necessary, because since the reason itself may be\nperverted, a man must have recourse to an external standard; we may\nsuppose his [Greek: logos] originally to have been a sufficient guide,\nbut when he has injured his moral perceptions in any degree, he must go\nout of himself for direction.\n[15] This is one of the many expressions which seem to imply that this\ntreatise is rather a collection of notes of a _viv\u00e2 voce_ lecture than\na set formal treatise. \u201cThe table\u201d of virtues and vices probably was\nsketched out and exhibited to the audience.\n[16] Afterwards defined as \u201cAll things whose value is measured by\nmoney.\u201d\n[17] We have no term exactly equivalent; it may be illustrated by\nHorace\u2019s use of the term _hiatus_:\n\u201cQuid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu?\u201d Opening the mouth wide\ngives a promise of something great to come, if nothing great does come,\nthis is a case of [Greek: chaunotes] or fruitless and unmeaning\n_hiatus_; the transference to the present subject is easy.\n[18] In like manner _we_ talk of laudable ambition, implying of course\nthere may be that which is not laudable.\n[19] An expression of Bishop Butler\u2019s, which corresponds exactly to the\ndefinition of [Greek: nemesis] in the Rhetoric.\n[20] That is, in the same genus; to be contraries, things must be\ngenerically connected: [Greek: ta pleiston allelon diestekota ton en to\nauto genei enantia orizontai]. Categories, iv. 15.\n[21] \u201c[Greek: Deuteros plous] is a proverb,\u201d says the Scholiast on the\nPhaedo, \u201cused of those who do anything safely and cautiously inasmuch\nas they who have miscarried in their first voyage, set about then:\npreparations for the second cautiously,\u201d and he then alludes to this\npassage.\n[22] That is, you must allow for the _recoil_. \u201cNaturam expellas furca\ntamen usque recurret.\u201d\nP. 43, l. 2. This illustration sets in so clear a light the doctrines\nentertained respectively by Aristotle, Eudoxus, and the Stoics\nregarding pleasure, that it is worth while to go into it fully.\nThe reference is to Iliad iii. 154-160. The old counsellors, as Helen\ncomes upon the city wall, acknowledge her surpassing beauty, and have\nno difficulty in understanding how both nations should have incurred\nsuch suffering for her sake still, fair as she is, home she must go,\nthat she bring not ruin on themselves and their posterity.\nThis exactly represents Aristotle\u2019s relation to Pleasure he does not,\nwith Eudoxus and his followers, exalt it into the Summum Bonum (as\nParis would risk all for Helen), nor does he the the Stoics call it\nwholly evil, as Hector might have said that the woes Helen had caused\nhad \u201cbanished all the beauty from her cheek,\u201d but, with the aged\ncounsellors, admits its charms, but aware of their dangerousness\nresolves to deny himself, he \u201cfeels her sweetness, yet defies her\nthrall.\u201d\n[24] \u0391\u1f34\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is here used as an analogous noun, to denote the faculty\nwhich, in respect of moral matters, discharges the same function that\nbodily sense does in respect of physical objects. It is worth while to\nnotice how in our colloquial language we carry out the same analogy. We\nsay of a transaction, that it \u201clooks ugly,\u201d \u201csounds oddly,\u201d is a \u201cnasty\njob,\u201d \u201cstinks in our nostrils,\u201d is a \u201chard dealing.\u201d\nBOOK III\n[1] A man is not responsible for being [Greek: theratos], because\n\u201cparticular propensions, from their very nature, must be felt, the\nobjects of them being present, though they cannot be gratified at all,\nor not with the allowance of the moral principle.\u201d But he is\nresponsible for being [Greek: eutheratos], because, though thus formed,\nhe \u201cmight have improved and raised himself to an higher and more secure\nstate of virtue by the contrary behaviour, by steadily following the\nmoral principle, supposed to be one part of his nature, and thus\nwithstanding that unavoidable danger of defection which necessarily\narose from propension, the other part of it. For by thus preserving his\nintegrity for some time, his danger would lessen, since propensions, by\nbeing inured to submit, would do it more easily and of course and his\nsecurity against this lessening danger would increase, since the moral\nprinciple would gain additional strength by exercise, both which things\nare implied in the notion of virtuous habits.\u201d (From the chapter on\nMoral Discipline m the Analogy, sect. iv.) The purpose of this\ndisquisition is to refute the Necessitarians; it is resumed in the\nthird chapter of this Book.\n[2] Virtue is not only the duty, but (by the laws of the Moral\nGovernment of the World) also the interest of Man, or to express it in\nBishop Butler\u2019s manner, Conscience and Reasonable self-love are the two\nprinciples in our nature which of right have supremacy over the rest,\nand these two lead in point of fact the same course of action. (Sermon\nII.)\n[3] Any ignorance of particular facts affects the rightness not of the\n[Greek: praxis], but of the [Greek: pragma], but ignorance of _i.e._\nincapacity to discern, Principles, shows the Moral Constitution to have\nbeen depraved, _i.e._ shows Conscience to be perverted, or the sight of\nSelf-love to be impaired.\n[4] [Greek: eneka] primarily denotes the relation of cause and effect\nall circumstances which in any way contribute to a cert result are\n[Greek: eneka] that result.\nFrom the power which we have or acquire of deducing future results from\npresent causes we are enabled to act towards, with a view to produce,\nthese results thus [Greek: eneka] comes to mean not causation merely,\nbut _designed_ causation and so [Greek: on eneka] is used for Motive,\nor final cause.\nIt is the primary meaning which is here intended, it would be a\ncontradiction in terms to speak of a man\u2019s being ignorant of his own\nMotive of action.\nWhen the man \u201cdrew a bow at a venture and smote the King of Israel\nbetween the joints of the harnesss\u201d (i Kings xxii 34) he did it [Greek:\neneka ton apdkteinai] the King of Israel, in the primary sense of\n[Greek: eneka] that is to say, the King\u2019s death was _in fact the\nresult_, but could not have been the motive, of the shot, because the\nKing was disguised and the shot was at a venture.\n[5] Bishop Butler would agree to this: he says of settled deliberate\nanger, \u201cIt seems in us plainly connected with a sense of virtue and\nvice, of moral good and evil.\u201d See the whole Sermon on Resentment.\n[6] Aristotle has, I venture to think, rather quibbled here, by using\n[Greek: epithumia] and its verb, equivocally as there is no following\nhis argument without condescending to the same device, I have used our\nword lust in its ancient signification Ps. xxiv. 12, \u201cWhat man is he\nthat lusteth to live?\u201d\n[7] The meaning is, that the _onus probandi_ is thrown upon the person\nwho maintains the distinction, Aristotle has a _prima facie_ case. The\nwhole passage is one of difficulty. Card wells text gives the passage\nfrom [Greek: dokei de] as a separate argument Bekker\u2019s seems to intend\nal 81 ir/jd\u00a3eis as a separate argument but if so, the argument would be\na mere _petitio principii_. I have adopted Cardwell\u2019s reading in part,\nbut retain the comma at [Greek: dmpho] and have translated the last\nfour words as applying to the whole discussion, whereas Cardwell\u2019s\nreading seems to restrict them to the last argument.\n[8] _i.e._ on objects of Moral Choice, opinion of this kind is not the\nsame as Moral Choice, because actions alone form habits and constitute\ncharacter, opinions are in general _signs_ of character, but when they\nbegin to be acted on they cease to be opinions, and merge in Moral\nChoice.\n\u201cTreason doth never prosper, what\u2019s the reason?\nWhen it doth prosper, none dare call it Treason.\u201d\n[9] The introduction of the words [Greek: dia tinos] seems a mere\nuseless repetition, as in the second chapter [Greek: en tini] added to\n[Greek: peri ti]. These I take for some among the many indications that\nthe treatise is a collection of notes for lectures, and not a finished\nor systematic one.\n[10] Suppose that three alternatives lay before a man, each of the\nthree is of course an object of Deliberation; when he has made his\nchoice, the alternative chosen does not cease to be in nature an object\nof Deliberation, but superadds the character of being chosen and so\ndistinguished. Three men are admitted candidates for an office, the one\nchosen is the successful candidate, so of the three [Greek: bouleuta],\nthe one chosen is the [Greek: bouleuton proaireton].\n[11] Compare Bishop Butler\u2019s \u201cSystem of Human Nature,\u201d in the Preface\nto the Sermons.\n[12] These words, [Greek: ek tou bouleusasthai\u2014bouleusin], contain the\naccount of the whole mental machinery of any action. The first step is\na Wish, implied in the first here mentioned, viz. Deliberation, for it\nhas been already laid down that Deliberation has for its object-matter\nmeans to Ends supposed to be set before the mind, the next step is\nDeliberation, the next Decision, the last the definite extending of the\nmental hand towards the object thus selected, the two last constitute\n[Greek: proairesis] in its full meaning. The word [Greek: orexis] means\nliterally \u201ca grasping at or after\u201d now as this physically may be either\nvague or definite, so too may the mental act, consequently the term as\ntransferred to the mind has two uses, and denotes either the first\nwish, [Greek: boulaesis], or the last definite movement, Will in its\nstrict and proper sense. These two uses are recognised in the Rhetoric\n(I 10), where [Greek: orexis] is divided into [Greek: alogos] and\n[Greek: logistikae].\nThe illustration then afforded by the polities alluded to is this, as\nthe Kings first decided and then announced their decision for\nacceptance and execution by their subjects, so Reason, having decided\non the course to be taken, communicates its decision to the Will, which\nthen proceeds to move [Greek: ta organika merae]. To instance in an\naction of the mixed kind mentioned in the first chapter, safe arrival\nat land is naturally desired, two means are suggested, either a certain\nloss of goods, or trying to save both lives and goods, the question\nbeing debated, the former is chosen, this decision is communicated to\nthe Will, which causes the owner\u2019s hands to throw overboard his goods:\nthe act is denominated voluntary, because the Will is consenting, but\nin so denominating it, we leave out of sight how that consent was\nobtained. In a purely compulsory case the never gets beyond the stage\nof Wish, for no means are power and deliberation therefore is useless,\nconsequently there is neither Decision nor Will, in other words, no\nChoice.\n[13] Compare the statement in the Rhetoric, 1 10, [Greek: esti d hae\nmen boulaeis agathou orexis (oudeis gar bouletai all ae otan oiaetho\neinai agathon)]\n[14] A stone once set in motion cannot be recalled, because it is then\nplaced under the operation of natural laws which cannot be controlled\nor altered, so too in Moral declension, there is a point at which\ngravitation operates irretrievably, \u201cthere is a certain bound to\nimprudence and misbehaviour which being transgressed, there remains no\nplace for repentance in the natural course of things.\u201d Bishop Butler\u2019s\nAnalogy, First Part, chap 11.\n[15] Habits being formed by acting in a certain way under certain\ncircumstances we can only choose how we will act not what circumstances\nwe will have to act under.\n[16] \u201c_Moral_ Courage\u201d is our phrase.\n[17] The meaning of this passage can scarcely be conveyed except by a\nparaphrase.\n\u201cThe object of each separate act of working is that which accords with\nthe habit they go to form. Courage is the habit which separate acts of\nbravery go to form, therefore the object of these is that which accords\nwith Courage, _i.e._ Courage itself. But Courage is honourable (which\nimplies that the end and object of it is honour, since things are\ndenominated according to their end and object), therefore the object of\neach separate act of bravery is honour.\u201d\n[18] For true Courage is required, i. Exact appreciation of danger. 2.\nA Proper motive for resisting fear. Each of the Spurious kinds will be\nfound to fail in one or other, or both.\n[19] This may merely mean, \u201cwho give strict orders\u201d not to flinch,\nwhich would imply the necessity of compulsion The word is capable of\nthe sense given above, which seems more forcible.\n[20] See Book VI. chap. xiii. near the end [Greek: sokrataes aehen oun\nlogous tas aretas oeto einai (epiotaemas gar einai pasas)]\n[21] Such as the noise, the rapid movements, and apparent confusion\nwhich to an inexperienced eye and ear would be alarming. So Livy says\nof the Gauls, v. 37, Nata in _vanos_ tumultus gens.\n[22]In Coronea in B\u0153otia, on the occasion of the citadel being betrayed\nto some Phocians. \u201cThe regulars\u201d were Boeotian troops, the [Greek:\npolitika] Coroneans.\n[23] By the difference of tense it seems Aristotle has mixed up two\nthings, beginning to speak of the particular instance, and then carried\ninto the general statement again. This it is scarce worth while to\nimitate.\n[24] The meaning of the phrase [Greek: kata sumbebaekos], as here used,\nin given in the Seventh Book, chap. X. [Greek: ei gar tis todi dia todi\naireitai ae diokei, kath ahuto men touto diokei kai aireitai, kata\nsumbebaekos de to proteron].\nBOOK V\n[1] Each term is important to make up the character of Justice, men\nmust have the capacity, do the acts, and do them from moral choice.\n[2] But not always. [Greek: Philein], for instance, has two senses, \u201cto\nlove\u201d and \u201cto kiss,\u201d [Greek: misein] but one. Topics, I. chap. XIII. 5.\n[3] _Things_ are [Greek: homonuma] which have only their name in\ncommon, being in themselves different. The [Greek: homonumia] is\n_close_ therefore when the difference though real is but slight. There\nis no English expression for [Greek: homonumia], \u201cequivocal\u201d being\napplied to a term and not to its various significates.\n[4] See Book I. chap. 1. [Greek: toiautaen de tina planaen echei kai\ntagatha k.t.l.]\n[5] A man habitually drunk in private is viewed by our law as confining\nhis vice to himself, and the law therefore does not attempt to touch\nhim; a religious hermit may be viewed as one who confines his virtue to\nhis own person.\n[6] See the account of Sejanus and Livia. Tac. Annal. IV. 3.\n[7] Cardwell\u2019s text, which here gives [Greek: paranomon], yields a much\neasier and more natural sense. All Injustice violates law, but only the\nparticular kinds violate equality; and therefore the unlawful : the\nunequal :: universal Injustice the particular _i.e._ as whole to part.\nThere is a reading which also alters the words within the parenthesis,\nbut this hardly affects the gist of the passage.\n[8] There are two reasons why the characters are not necessarily\ncoincident. He is a good citizen, who does his best to carry out the\n[Greek: politeia] under which he lives, but this may be faulty, so\ntherefore _pro tanto_ is he.\nAgain, it is sufficient, so far as the Community is concerned, that he\ndoes the _facts_ of a good man but for the perfection of his own\nindividual character, he must do them virtuously. A man may move\nrightly in his social orbit, without revolving rightly on his own axis.\nThe question is debated in the Politics, III. 2. Compare also the\ndistinction between the brave man, and good soldier (supra, Book III.\nchap. xii.), and also Bishop Butler\u2019s first Sermon.\n[9] Terms used for persons.\n[10] By [Greek:\u2014\u2014] is meant numbers themselves, 4, 20, 50, etc, by\n[Greek:\u2014\u2014] these numbers exemplified, 4 horses, 20 sheep, etc.\n[11] The profits of a mercantile transaction (say \u00a31000) are to be\ndivided between A and B, in the ratio of 2 to 3 (which is the real\npoint to be settled); then,\nA : B :: 400 : 600.\nA : 400 :: B : 600 (permutando, and assuming a value for A and B, so as\nto make them commensurable with the respectiy sums).\nA+400 : B+600 :: A : B. This represents the actual distribution; its\nfairness depending entirely on that of the first proportion.\n[12] _i.e._ where the ratio is that of equality, thus 2 : 2 :: 40 : 40\n[13] Her Majesty\u2019s \u201cJustices.\u201d\n[14] I have omitted the next three lines, as they seem to be out of\nplace here, and to occur much more naturally afterwards; it not being\nlikely that they were originally twice written, one is perhaps at\nliberty to give Aristotle the benefit of the doubt, and conclude that\nhe put them where they made the best sense.\n[15] This I believe to be the meaning of the passage but do not pretend\nto be able to get it out of the words.\n[16] This is apparently contrary to what was said before, but not\nreally so. Aristotle does not mean that the man in authority struck\nwrongfully, but he takes the extreme case of simple Reciprocation, and\nin the second case, the man who strikes one in authority commits two\noffences, one against the person (and so far they are equal), and\nanother against the office.\n[17] \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 denotes, 1st, a kindly feeling issuing in a gratuitous act\nof kindness, 2ndly, the effect of this act of kindness on a generous\nmind; 3rdly, this effect issuing in a requital of the kindness.\n[18] The Shoemaker would get a house while the Builder only had (say)\none pair of shoes, or at all events not so many as he ought to have.\nThus the man producing the least valuable ware would get the most\nvaluable, and _vice versa_.\nAdopting, as I have done, the reading which omits [Greek:\u2014\u2014] at\n[Greek:\u2014\u2014], we have simply a repetition of the caution, that before\nReciprocation is attempted, there must be the same ratio between the\nwares as between the persons, _i.e._ the ratio of equality.\nIf we admit [Greek: ou], the meaning may be, that you must not bring\ninto the proportion the difference mentioned above [Greek: eteron kai\nouk ison], since for the purposes of commerce all men are equal.\nSay that the Builder is to the Shoemaker as 10:1. Then there must be\nthe same ratio between the wares, consequently the highest artist will\ncarry off the most valuable wares, thus combining in himself both\n[Greek: uperochai]. The following are the three cases, given 100 pr.\nshoes = 1 house.\nBuilder : Shoemaker : : 1  pr.  shoes      : 1 house\u2014_wrong_.\n\u2014\u2014          \u2014\u2014          100 pr. shoes      : 1 house\u2014_right_\n\u2014\u2014          \u2014\u2014          10 (100 pr. shoes) : 1 house\u2014_wrong_.\n[19] [Greek] Compare a similar use of [Greek]. De Interpretatione, II.\n2. [Greek].\n[20] Every unjust act embodies [Greek: to adikon], which is a violation\nof [Greek: to ison], and so implies a greater and a less share, the\nformer being said to fall to the doer, the latter to the sufferer, of\ninjury.\n[21] This passage certainly occurs awkwardly here. If attached to the\nclose of the preceding Chapter it would leave that Chapter incomplete,\nfor the question is not gone into, but only stated. As the commencement\nof this Chapter it is yet more out of place; I should propose to insert\nit at the commencement of the following Chapter, to which it forms an\nappropriate introduction.\n[22] In a pure democracy men are absolutely, _i.e._ numerically, equal,\nin other forms only proportionately equal. Thus the meanest British\nsubject is proportionately equal to the Sovereign, that is to say, is\nas fully secured in his rights as the Sovereign in hers.\n[23] Or, according to Cardwell\u2019s reading ([Greek: kineton ou mentoi\npan]) \u201cbut amongst ourselves there is Just, which is naturally\nvariable, but certainly all Just is not such.\u201d The sense of the passage\nis not affected by the reading. In Bekker\u2019s text we must take [Greek:\nkineton] to mean the same as [Greek: kinoumenon], _i.e._ \u201cwe admit\nthere is no Just which has not been sometimes disallowed, still,\u201d etc.\nWith Cardwell\u2019s, [Greek: kineton] will mean \u201cwhich not only _does_ but\nnaturally _may_ vary.\u201d\n[24] Murder is unjust by the law of nature, Smuggling by enactment.\nTherefore any act which can be referred to either of these heads is an\nunjust act, or, as Bishop Butler phrases it, an act _materially_\nunjust. Thus much may be decided without reference to the agent. See\nthe note on page 32, l. 16.\n[25] \u201cAs distinct from pain or loss.\u201d Bishop Butler\u2019s Sermon on\nResentment. See also, Rhet. 11. 2 Def. of [Greek: orgae].\n[26] This method of reading the passage is taken from Zell as quoted in\nCardwell\u2019s Notes, and seems to yield the best sense. The Paraphrast\ngives it as follows:\n\u201cBut the aggressor is not ignorant that he began, and so he feels\nhimself to be wrong [and will not acknowledge that he is the\naggressor], but the other does not.\u201d\n[27] As when a man is \u201c_justified_ at the Grass Market,\u201d _i.e._ hung.\n[28] Where the stock of good is limited, if any individual takes more\nthan his share some one else must have less than his share; where it is\ninfinite, or where there is no good at all this cannot happen.\n[29] The reference is to chap. vii. where it was said that the law\nviews the parties in a case of particular injustice as originally\nequal, but now unequal, the wrong doer the gainer and the sufferer the\nloser by the wrong, but in the case above supposed there is but _one_\nparty.\n[30] So in the Politics, 1. 2.\n_Hae men gar psuchae tou somatos archei despotikaen archaen, o de nous\ntaes orexeos politikaen kai despotikaev._\nCompare also Bishop Butler\u2019s account of human nature as a system\u2014of the\ndifferent authority of certain principles, and specially the supremacy\nof Conscience.\nBOOK VI\n[1] I understand the illustration to be taken from the process of\nlowering a weight into its place; a block of marble or stone, for\ninstance, in a building.\n[2] Called for convenience sake Necessary and Contingent matter.\n[3] One man learns Mathematics more easily than another, in common\nlanguage, _he has a turn for_ Mathematics, _i e_ something in his\nmental conformation answers to that science The Phrenologist shows the\nbump denoting this aptitude.\n[4] And therefore the question resolves itself into this, \u201cWhat is the\nwork of the Speculative, and what of the Practical, faculty of Reason.\u201d\nSee the description of _apetae_ II. 5.\n[5] _praxis_ is here used in its strict and proper meaning.\n[6] That is to say, the Will waits upon deliberation in which Reason is the\njudge; when the decision is pronounced, the Will must act accordingly.\nThe question at issue always is, _Is this Good?_ because the Will is\nonly moved by an impression of Good; the Decision then will be always\n_Aye or No_, and the mental hand is put forth to grasp in the former\ncase, and retracted in the later.\nSo far as what must take place in _every_ Moral Action, right or wrong,\nthe Machinery of the mind being supposed uninjured but to constitute a\ngood Moral Choice, _i e._. a good Action, the Reason must have said Aye\nwhen it ought.\nThe cases of faulty action will be, either when the Machinery is\nperfect but wrongly directed, as in the case of a deliberate crime, or\nwhen the direction given by the Reason is right but the Will does not\nmove in accordance with that direction, in other words, when the\nMachinery is out of order; as in the case of the [Greek: akrates]\u2014video\nmeliora proboque, Deteriora sequor.\n[7] See the note on [Greek: Arche] on page 4, l. 30.\n[8] The cobbler is at his last, why? to make shoes, which are to clothe\nthe feet of someone and the price to be paid, _i.e._ the produce of his\nindustry, is to enable him to support his wife and children; thus his\nproduction is subordinate to Moral Action.\n[9] It may be fairly presumed that Aristotle would not thus have varied\nhis phrase without some real difference of meaning. That difference is\nfounded, I think, on the two senses of [Greek: orexis] before alluded\nto (note, p. 53, l. 33). The first impulse of the mind towards Action\nmay be given either by a vague desire or by the suggestion of Reason.\nThe vague desire passing through the deliberate stage would issue in\nMoral Choice. Reason must enlist the Will before any Action can take\nplace.\nReason ought to be the originator in all cases, as Bishop Butler\nobserves that Conscience should be. If this were so, every act of Moral\nChoice would be [Greek: orektikos nous].\nBut one obvious function of the feelings and passions in our composite\nnature is to instigate Action, when Reason and Conscience by themselves\ndo not: so that as a matter of fact our Moral Choice is, in general,\nfairly described as [Greek: orexis dianoetike]. See Bishop Butler\u2019s\nSermon II. and the First upon Compassion.\n[10] The mind attains truth, either for the sake of truth itself\n([Greek: aplos]), or for the sake of something further ([Greek: eneka\ntinos]). If the first then either syllogistically ([Greek: episteme]),\nnon-syllogistically ([Greek: nous]), or by union of the two methods\n([Greek: sophla]). If the second, either with a view to _act_ ([Greek:\nphronesis]), or with a view to _make_ ([Greek: techne]).\nOtherwise. The mind contemplates Matter Necessary or Contingent. If\nnecessary, Principles ([Greek: nous]), Deductions ([Greek: episteme]),\nor Mixed ([Greek: sophla]). If Contingent, Action ([Greek: phronesis]),\nProduction ([Greek: techen]). (Giphanius quoted in Cardwell\u2019s notes.)\n[11] It is the opening statement of the Post Analytics.\n[12] Aristotle in his logical analysis of Induction, Prior. Analytics\nII. 25, defines it to be \u201cthe proving the inherence of the major term\nin the middle (_i.e._ proving the truth of the major premiss in fig. 1)\nthrough the minor term.\u201d He presupposes a Syllogism in the first Figure\nwith an universal affirmative conclusion, which reasons, of course,\nfrom an universal, which universal is to be taken as proved by\nInduction. His doctrine turns upon a canon which he there quotes. \u201cIf\nof one and the same term two others be predicated, one of which is\ncoextensive with that one and the same, the other may be predicated of\nthat which is thus coextensive.\u201d The fact of this coextensiveness must\nbe ascertained by [Greek: nous], in other words, by the Inductive\nFaculty. We will take Aldrich\u2019s instance.\nAll Magnets attract iron\nA B C are Magnets\nA B C attract iron.\nPresupposed Syllogism reasoning from an universal.\nA B C attract iron (Matter of observation and experiment)\nAll Magnets are A B C (Assumed by [Greek: nous], i.e. the Inductive\nfaculty)\nAll Magnets attract iron (Major premiss of the last Syllogism proved by\ntaking the minor term of that for the middle term of this.)\nOr, according to the canon quoted above: A B C are Magnets. A B C\nattract iron.\nBut [Greek: nous] tells me that the term Magnets is coextensive with\nthe term A B C, therefore of all Magnets I may predicate that they\nattract iron.\nInduction is said by Aristotle to be [Greek: hoia phanton], but he says\nin the same place that for this reason we must _conceive_ ([Greek:\nnoehin]) the term containing the particular Instances (as A B C above)\nas composed of all the Individuals.\nIf Induction implied actual examination of all particular instances it\nwould cease to be Reasoning at all and sink into repeated acts of\nSimple Apprehension it is really the bridging over of a chasm, not the\nsteps cut in the rock on either side to enable us to walk down into and\nagain out of it. It is a branch of probable Reasoning, and its validity\ndepends _entirely_ upon the quality of the particular mind which\nperforms it. Rapid Induction has always been a distinguishing mark of\nGenius the certainty produced by it is Subjective and not Objective. It\nmay be useful to exhibit it Syllogistically, but the Syllogism which\nexhibits it is either nugatory, or contains a premiss _literally_\nfalse. It will be found useful to compare on the subject of Induction\n_as the term is used by Aristotle_, Analytica Prior. II 25 26 Analytica\nPost. I. 1, 3, and I. Topics VI I and X.\n[13] The reference is made to the Post Analyt I II and it is impossible\nto understand the account of [Greek: epistaemae] without a perusal of\nthe chapter, the additions to the definition referred to relate to the\nnature of the premisses from which [Greek: epistaemae] draws its\nconclusions they are to be \u201ctrue, first principles incapable of any\nsyllogistic proof, better known than the conclusion, prior to it, and\ncauses of it.\u201d (See the appendix to this Book.)\n[14] This is the test of correct logical division, that the _membra\ndividentia_ shall be opposed, _i.e._ not included the one by the other.\n[15] The meaning of the [Greek: hepehi] appears to be this: the appeal\nis made in the first instance to popular language, just as it the case\nof [Greek: epistaemae], and will be in those of [Greek: phronaesis] and\n[Greek: sophia]. We commonly call Architecture an Art, and it is so and\nso, therefore the name Art and this so and so are somehow connected to\nprove that connection to be \u201ccoextensiveness,\u201d we predicate one of the\nother and then simply convert the proposition, which is the proper test\nof any logical definition, or of any specific property. See the Topics,\n1. vi.\n[16] See the parable of the unjust Steward, in which the popular sense\nof [Greek: phronaesis] is strongly brought out; [Greek: ephaenesen ho\nkurios ton oikonomon taes adikias oti phronimos epoiaesen hoti ohi\nviohi tou aionos toutou phronimoteroi, k.t.l.]\u2014Luke xvi. 8.\n[17] Compare the [Greek: aplos] and [Greek: kath\u2019 ekasta pepaideumenos]\nof Book I. chap. 1.\n[18] The two aspects under which Virtue may be considered as claiming\nthe allegiance of moral agents are, that of being right, and that of\nbeing truly expedient, because Conscience and Reasonable Self-Love are\nthe two Principles of our moral constitution naturally supreme and\n\u201cConscience and Self-Love, _if we understand our true happiness_,\nalways lead us the same way.\u201d Bishop Butler, end of Sermon III.\nAnd again:\n\u201cIf by _a sense of interest_ is meant a practical regard to what is\nupon the whole our Happiness this is not only coincident with the\nprinciple of Virtue or Moral Rectitude, but is a part of the idea\nitself. And it is evident this Reasonable Self-Love wants to be\nimproved as really as any principle in our nature. So little cause is\nthere for Moralists to disclaim this principle.\u201d From the note on sect.\niv. of the chapter on Moral Discipline, Analogy, part I chap. v.\n[19] See the note on [Greek: Arche] on page 4, l. 30.\nThe student will find it worth while to compare this passage with the\nfollowing\u2014Chap. xiii. of this book beginning [Greek: e d\u2019 exis to\nommati touto k. t. l]\u2014vii. 4. [Greek: eti kai ode physikos. k.t.l.]\nvii. 9.\u2014[Greek: ae gar arethae kai ae mochthaeria. k.t.l.]\u2014iii. 7 _ad\nfinem_. [Greek: ei de tis legoi. k.t.l.]\n[20] This is not quite fair. Used in its strict sense, Art does not\nadmit of degrees of excellence any more than Practical Wisdom. In\npopular language we use the term \u201cwiser man,\u201d as readily as \u201cbetter\nartist\u201d really denoting in each case different degrees of approximation\nto Practical Wisdom and Art respectively, [Greek: dia to ginesthai tous\nepainous di anaphoras]. I. 12.\n[21] He would be a _better Chymist_ who should poison intentionally,\nthan he on whose mind the prevailing impression was that \u201cEpsom Salts\nmean Oxalic Acid, and Syrup of Senna Laudanum.\u201d\n[22]The term Wisdom is used in our English Translation of the Old\nTestament in the sense first given to [Greek:\u2014\u2014] here. \u201cThen wrought\nBezaleel and Ahohab, and every _wise-hearted man, in whom the Lord put\nwisdom and understanding_ to know how to work all manner of work for\nthe service of the Sanctuary\u201d Exodus xxxvi. i.\n[23] [Greek:\u2014\u2014] and [Greek:\u2014\u2014], (in the strict sense, for it is used in\nmany different senses in this book) are different parts of the whole\nfunction [Greek:\u2014\u2014], [Greek:\u2014\u2014] takes in conclusions, drawn by strict\nreasoning from Principles of a certain kind which [Greek: \u2014\u2014] supplies.\nIt is conceivable that a man might go on gaining these principles by\nIntuition and never reasoning from them, and so [Greek: \u2014\u2014] might exist\nindependent of [Greek:\u2014\u2014], but not this without that. Put the two\ntogether, the head to the trunk, and you form the living being\n[Greek:\u2014\u2014]. There are three branches of [Greek:\u2014\u2014] according to Greek\nPhilosophy, [Greek:\u2014\u2014], [Greek:\u2014\u2014], [Greek:\u2014\u2014]. Science is perhaps the\nnearest English term, but we have none really equivalent.\n[24][Greek:\u2014\u2014] is here used in its most extensive sense, [Greek:\u2014\u2014]\nwould be its chief Instrument.\n[25] The faculty concerned with which is [Greek:\u2014\u2014].\n[26] In every branch of Moral Action in which Practical Wisdom is\nemployed there will be general principles, and the application of them,\nbut in some branches there are distinct names appropriated to the\noperations of Practical Wisdom, in others there are not.\nThus Practical Wisdom, when employed on the general principles of Civil\nGovernment, is called Legislation, as administering its particular\nfunctions it is called simply Government. In Domestic Management, there\nare of course general Rules, and also the particular application of\nthem; but here the faculty is called only by one name. So too when\nSelf-Interest is the object of Practical Wisdom.\n[27] [Greek:\u2014\u2014], \u201cour mere Operatives in Public business.\u201d (Chalmers.)\n[28] Practical Wisdom may be employed either respecting Self, (which is\n[Greek:\u2014\u2014] proper) or not-Self, _i.e._ either one\u2019s family=[Greek:\u2014\u2014],\nor one\u2019s community=[Greek:\u2014\u2014], but here the supreme and subordinate are\ndistinguished, the former is [Greek:\u2014\u2014], the latter [Greek:\u2014\u2014] proper,\nwhose functions are deliberation and the administration of justice.\n[29] But where can this be done, if there be no community? see Horace\u2019s\naccount of the way in which his father made him reap instruction from\nthe examples in the society around him. 1. Sat. iv. 105, etc. See also\nBishop Butler, Analogy, part I. chap. v. sect. iii.\nThe whole question of the Selfish Morality is treated in Bishop\nButler\u2019s first three and the eleventh Sermons, in which he shows the\ncoincidence in _fact_ of enlightened Self-Love and Benevolence _i.e._\nlove of others. Compare also what is said in the first Book of this\ntreatise, chap. v., about [Greek: autarkeia].\n[30] More truly \u201cimplied,\u201d namely, that Practical Wisdom results from\nexperience.\n[31] This observation seems to be introduced, simply because suggested\nby the last, and not because at all relevant to the matter in hand.\n[32]  An instance of Principles gained [Greek: aisthesei]. (Book 1.\nchap. viii.)\n[33] Particulars are called [Greek: eschata] because they are last\narrived at in the deliberative process, but a little further on we have\nthe term applied to first principles, because they stand at one\nextremity, and facts at the other, of the line of action.\n[34] I prefer the reading [Greek: e phronesis], which gives this sense,\n\u201cWell, as I have said, Practical Wisdom is this kind of sense, and the\nother we mentioned is different in kind.\u201d In a passage so utterly\nunimportant, and thrown in almost colloquially, it is not worth while\nto take much trouble about such a point.\n[35] The definition of it in the Organon (Post Analyt. 1. xxiv.), \u201ca\nhappy conjecture of the middle term without time to consider of it.\u201d\nThe quaestio states the phenomena, and the middle term the causation\nthe rapid ascertaining of which constitutes [Greek: anchinoia]. All\nthat receives light from the sun is bright on the side next to the sun.\nThe moon receives light from the sun, The moon is bright on the side\nnext the sun. The [Greek: anchinoia] consists in rapidly and correctly\naccounting for the observed fact, that the moon is bright on the side\nnext to the sun.\n[36] Opinion is a complete, deliberation an incomplete, mental act.\n[37] The End does not sanctify the Means.\n[38] The meaning is, there is one End including all others; and in this\nsense [Greek: phronesis] is concerned with means, not Ends but there\nare also many subordinate Ends which are in fact Means to the Great End\nof all. Good counsel has reference not merely to the grand End, but to\nthe subordinate Ends which [Greek: phronesis] selects as being right\nmeans to the Grand End of all.\n[39] The relative [Greek: on] might be referred to [Greek: sumpheron],\nbut that [Greek: eubonlia] has been already divided into two kinds, and\nthis construction would restrict the name to one of them, namely that\n[Greek: pros ti telos] as opposed to that [Greek: pros to telos aplos].\n[40] We have no term which at all approximates to the meaning of this\nword, much less will our language admit of the play upon it which\nconnects it with [Greek: suggnomae].\n[41] Meaning, of course, all those which relate to Moral Action.\n[Greek: psronaesis ] is equivalent to [Greek: euboulia, ounesis,\ngnomae, and nous] (in the new sense here given to it).\nThe faculty which guides us truly in all matters of Moral Action is\n[Greek: phronaesis], i.e. Reason directed by Goodness or Goodness\ninformed by Reason. But just as every faculty of body and soul is not\nactually in operation at the same time, though the Man is acting, so\nproper names are given to the various Functions of Practical Wisdom.\nIs the [Greek: phronimos] forming plans to attain some particular End?\nhe is then [Greek: euboulos]\u2014is he passing under review the suggestions\nof others? he is [Greek: sunetos]\u2014is he judging of the acts of others?\nhe admits [Greek: gnomae] to temper the strictness of justness\u2014is he\napplying general Rules to particular cases? he is exercising [Greek:\nnous praktikos] or [Greek: agsthaesis]\u2014while in each and all he is\n[Greek: phronimos]?\n[42] See note, on p. 140.\n[43] There are cases where we must simply accept or reject without\nproof: either when Principles are propounded which are prior to all\nreasoning, or when particular facts are brought before us which are\nsimply matters of [Greek: agsthaesis]. Aristotle here brings both these\ncases within the province of [Greek: nous], _i.e._ he calls by this\nname the Faculty which attains Truth in each.\n[44] _i.e._ of the [Greek: syllogisimai ton prakton].\n[45] See the note on [Greek: Archae] on p. 4,1 30. As a matter of fact\nand mental experience the Major Premiss of the Practica Syllogism is\nwrought into the mind by repeatedly acting upon the Minor Premiss\n(_i.e._ by [Greek: ethismos]).\nAll that is pleasant is to be done,\nThis is pleasant,\nThis is to be done\nBy habitually acting on the Minor Premiss, _i.e._ on the suggestions of\n[Greek: epithymia], a man comes really to hold the Major Premiss.\nAristotle says of the man destitute of all self-control that he is\nfirmly persuaded that it is his proper line to pursue the gratification\nof his bodily appetites, [Greek: dia to toioytos einai oios diokein\naytas]. And his analysis of [Greek: akrasia] (the state of progress\ntowards this utter abandonment to passion) shows that each case of\nprevious good resolution succumbing to temptation is attributable to\n[Greek: epithymia] suggesting its own Minor Premiss in place of the\nright one. Book VII. 8 and 5.\n[46] The _consequentia_ is this:\nThere are cases both of principles and facts which cannot admit of\nreasoning, and must be authoritatively determined by [Greek: nous].\nWhat makes [Greek: nous] to be a true guide? only practice, i.e.\nExperience, and _therefore_, etc.\n[47] This is a note to explain [Greek: hygieina] and [Greek: euektika],\nhe gives these three uses of the term [Greek: hygieinon] in the Topics,\nI. xiii. 10,\n{ [Greek: to men hygieias poi\u00e6tikon], [Greek: hygieinon legetai]\n{ [Greek: to de phylaktikon],\n{ [Greek: to de s\u00e6mantikon].\nOf course the same will apply to [Greek: euektikon].\n[48] Healthiness is the formal cause of health.\nMedicine is the efficient cause of health.\nSee Book X. chap. iv. [Greek: hosper oud h\u00e6 hygieia kai ho iatros\nhomoios aitia esti tou ugiainein].\n[49] [Greek: phron\u00e6sis] is here used in a partial sense to signify the\nIntellectual, as distinct from the Moral, element of Practical Wisdom.\n[50] This is another case of an observation being thrown in _obiter_,\nnot relevant to, but suggested by, the matter in hand.\n[51] See Book II. chap. iii. and V. xiii.\n[52]The article is supplied at [Greek: panourgous], because the\nabstract word has just been used expressly in a bad sense. \u201cUp to\nanything\u201d is the nearest equivalent to [Greek: panourgos], but too\nnearly approaches to a colloquial vulgarism.\n[53] See the note on [Greek: Arch\u00e6] on page 4, l. 30.\nP. 147, l. 14. And for the Minor, of course,\n\u201cThis particular action is\u2014\u2014\u2014.\u201d\nWe may paraphrase [Greek: to telos] by [Greek: ti dei prattein\u2014ti gar\ndei prattein h\u00e6 m\u00e6, to telos aut\u00e6s estin] i.e. [Greek: t\u00e6s\nphron\u00e6seos].\u2014(Chap. xi. of this Book.)\n[55] \u201cLook asquint on the face of truth.\u201d Sir T. Browne, Religio\nMedici.\n[56] The term [Greek: sophronikoi] must be understood as governing the\nsignification of the other two terms, there being no single Greek term\nto denote in either case mere dispositions towards these Virtues.\n[57] Compare the passage at the commencement of Book X. [Greek: nun de\nphainontai] [Greek: katokochimon ek t\u00e6s aret\u00e6s].\n[58] It must be remembered, that [Greek: phron\u00e6sis] is used throughout\nthis chapter in two senses, its proper and complete sense of Practical\nWisdom, and its incomplete one of merely the Intellectual Element of\nit.\nBOOK VII\n[1] The account of Virtue and Vice hitherto given represents rather\nwhat men _may be_ than what they _are_. In this book we take a\npractical view of Virtue and Vice, in their ordinary, every day\ndevelopment.\n[2] This illustrates the expression, \u201c_Deceits_ of the Flesh.\u201d\n[3] Another reading omits the [Greek:\u2014\u2014]; the meaning of the whole\npassage would be exactly the same\u2014it would then run, \u201cif he had been\nconvinced of the rightness of what he does, _i.e._ if he were now\nacting on conviction, he might stop in his course on a change of\nconviction.\u201d\n[4] Major and minor Premises of the [Greek:\u2014\u2014] [Greek\u2014\u2014]\n[5]Some necessarily implying knowledge of the particular, others not.\n[6] As a modern parallel, take old Trumbull in Scott\u2019s \u201cRed Gauntlet.\u201d\n[7] That is, as I understand it, either the major or the minor premise,\nit is true, that \u201call that is sweet is pleasant,\u201d it is true also, that\n\u201cthis is sweet,\u201d what is contrary to Right Reason is the bringing in\nthis minor to the major _i.e._ the universal maxim, forbidding to\ntaste. Thus, a man goes to a convivial meeting with the maxim in his\nmind \u201cAll excess is to be avoided,\u201d at a certain time his [Greek:\u2014\u2014]\ntells him \u201cThis glass is excess.\u201d As a matter of mere reasoning, he\ncannot help receiving the conclusion \u201cThis glass is to be avoided,\u201d and\nsupposing him to be morally sound he would accordingly abstain. But\n[Greek:\u2014\u2014], being a simple tendency towards indulgence suggests, in\nplace of the minor premise \u201cThis is excess,\u201d its own premise \u201cThis is\nsweet,\u201d this again suggests the self-indulgent maxim or principle\n(\u2018[Greek:\u2014\u2014]), \u201cAll that is sweet is to be tasted,\u201d and so, by strict\nlogical sequence, proves \u201cThis glass is to be tasted.\u201d\nThe solution then of the ph\u00e6nomenon of [Greek:\u2014\u2014] is this that\n[Greek:\u2014\u2014], by its direct action on the animal nature, swamps the\nsuggestions of Right Reason.\nOn the high ground of Universals, [Greek:\u2014\u2014] i.e. [Greek:\u2014\u2014] easily\ndefeats [Greek:\u2014\u2014]. The [Greek:\u2014\u2014], an hour before he is in temptation,\nwould never deliberately prefer the maxim \u201cAll that is sweet is to be\ntasted\u201d to \u201cAll excess is to be avoided.\u201d The [Greek:\u2014\u2014] would.\nHorace has a good comment upon this (II Sat 2):\nQu\u00e6 virtus et quanta, bom, sit vivere parvo\nDiscite, _non inter lances mensasque nitentes_\nVerum hic _impransi_ mecum disquirite\nCompare also Proverbs XXIII. 31. \u201cLook not thou upon the wine when it\nis red,\u201d etc.\n[8] As we commonly speak, Metaphysicians. Physiology of course includes\nMetaphysics.\n[9] [Greek: oron]. Aristotle\u2019s own account of this word (Prior Analyt\nii. 1) is [Greek: eis on dialuetai hae protasis], but both in the\naccount of [Greek: nous] and here it seems that the proposition itself\nis really indicated by it.\n[10] The Greek would give \u201cavoids excessive pain,\u201d but this is not\ntrue, for the excess of pain would be ground for excuse the warrant for\ntranslating as in the text, is the passage occurring just below [Greek:\ndiokei tas uperbolas kai pheugei metrias lupas].\n[11] Compare Bishop Butler on Particular Propensions, Analogy, Part I\nchap v sect. iv.\n[12] That is, they are to the right states as Vice to Virtue.\n[14] Consult in connection with this Chapter the Chapter on [Greek:\norgae] in the Rhetoric, II. 2, and Bishop Butler\u2019s Sermon on\nResentment.\n[15] The reasoning here being somewhat obscure from the concisement of\nexpression, the following exposition of it is subjoined.\nActions of Lust are wrong actions done with pleasure,\nWrong actions done with pleasure are more justly objects of wrath,[*]\nSuch as are more justly objects of wrath are more unjust,\nActions of Lust are more unjust\n[*] [Greek: hubpis] is introduced as the single instance from\nwhich this premiss is proved inductively. See the account of it in\nthe Chapter of the Rhetoric referred to in the preceding note.\n[16][Greek: ton dae lechthenton]. Considerable difference of opinion\nexists as to the proper meaning of these words. The emendation which\nsubstitutes [Greek: akrataes] for [Greek: akolastos] removes all\ndifficulty, as the clause would then naturally refer to [Greek: ton mae\nproairoumenon] but Zell adheres to the reading in the text of Bekker,\nbecause the authority of MSS and old editions is all on this side.\nI understand [Greek: mallon] as meant to modify the word [Greek:\nmalakias], which properly denotes that phase of [Greek: akrasia] (not\n[Greek: akolasia]) which is caused by pain.\nThe [Greek: akolastos] _deliberately_ pursues pleasure and declines\npain if there is to be a distinct name for the latter phase, it comes\nunder [Greek: malakia] more nearly than any other term, though perhaps\nnot quite properly.\nOr the words may be understood as referring to the class of wrong acts\ncaused by avoidance of pain, whether deliberate or otherwise, and then\nof course the names of [Greek: malakia] and [Greek: akolasia] may be\nfitly given respectively.\n[17] \u201cIf we went into a hospital where all were sick or dying, we\nshould think those least ill who were insensible to pain; a physician\nwho knew the whole, would behold them with despair. And there is a\nmortification of the soul as well as of the body, in which the first\nsymptoms of returning hope are pain and anguish\u201d Sewell, Sermons to\nYoung Men (Sermon xii.)\n[18] Before the time of trial comes the man deliberately makes his\nMoral Choice to act rightly, but, at the moment of acting, the powerful\nstrain of desire makes him contravene this choice his Will does not act\nin accordance with the affirmation or negation of his Reason. His\nactions are therefore of the mixed kind. See Book III. chap. i, and\nnote on page 128.\n[19] Let a man be punctual _on principle_ to any one engagement in the\nday, and he must, as a matter of course, keep all his others in their\ndue places relatively to this one; and so will often wear an appearance\nof being needlessly punctilious in trifles.\n[20] Because he is destitute of these minor springs of action, which\nare intended to supply the defects of the higher principle.\nSee Bishop Butler\u2019s first Sermon on Compassion, and the conclusion of\nnote on p. 129.\nBOOK VIII\n[1] \u201cOwe no man anything, but to _love_ one another for he that loveth\nanother _hath fulfilled the Law_.\u201d Romans XIII. 8.\n[2] [Greek: kerameis].

{"text": "A TREATISE ON GOVERNMENT\nBy Aristotle\nTranslated From The Greek Of Aristotle By William Ellis, A.M.\nLondon & Toronto Published By J M Dent & Sons Ltd. & In New York By E.\nP. Dutton &. Co\nFirst Issue Of This Edition 1912 Reprinted 1919, 1923, 1928\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Politics of Aristotle is the second part of a treatise of which\nthe Ethics is the first part. It looks back to the Ethics as the Ethics\nlooks forward to the Politics. For Aristotle did not separate, as we are\ninclined to do, the spheres of the statesman and the moralist. In the\nEthics he has described the character necessary for the good life, but\nthat life is for him essentially to be lived in society, and when in the\nlast chapters of the Ethics he comes to the practical application of his\ninquiries, that finds expression not in moral exhortations addressed to\nthe individual but in a description of the legislative opportunities\nof the statesman. It is the legislator's task to frame a society which\nshall make the good life possible. Politics for Aristotle is not a\nstruggle between individuals or classes for power, nor a device for\ngetting done such elementary tasks as the maintenance of order and\nsecurity without too great encroachments on individual liberty. The\nstate is \"a community of well-being in families and aggregations\nof families for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life.\" The\nlegislator is a craftsman whose material is society and whose aim is the\ngood life.\nIn an early dialogue of Plato's, the Protagoras, Socrates asks\nProtagoras why it is not as easy to find teachers of virtue as it is to\nfind teachers of swordsmanship, riding, or any other art. Protagoras'\nanswer is that there are no special teachers of virtue, because virtue\nis taught by the whole community. Plato and Aristotle both accept the\nview of moral education implied in this answer. In a passage of the\nRepublic (492 b) Plato repudiates the notion that the sophists have a\ncorrupting moral influence upon young men. The public themselves,\nhe says, are the real sophists and the most complete and thorough\neducators. No private education can hold out against the irresistible\nforce of public opinion and the ordinary moral standards of society.\nBut that makes it all the more essential that public opinion and\nsocial environment should not be left to grow up at haphazard as they\nordinarily do, but should be made by the wise legislator the expression\nof the good and be informed in all their details by his knowledge. The\nlegislator is the only possible teacher of virtue.\nSuch a programme for a treatise on government might lead us to expect in\nthe Politics mainly a description of a Utopia or ideal state which\nmight inspire poets or philosophers but have little direct effect upon\npolitical institutions. Plato's Republic is obviously impracticable, for\nits author had turned away in despair from existing politics. He has no\nproposals, in that dialogue at least, for making the best of things as\nthey are. The first lesson his philosopher has to learn is to turn away\nfrom this world of becoming and decay, and to look upon the unchanging\neternal world of ideas. Thus his ideal city is, as he says, a pattern\nlaid up in heaven by which the just man may rule his life, a pattern\ntherefore in the meantime for the individual and not for the statesman.\nIt is a city, he admits in the Laws, for gods or the children of gods,\nnot for men as they are.\nAristotle has none of the high enthusiasm or poetic imagination of\nPlato. He is even unduly impatient of Plato's idealism, as is shown\nby the criticisms in the second book. But he has a power to see the\npossibilities of good in things that are imperfect, and the patience of\nthe true politician who has learned that if he would make men what\nthey ought to be, he must take them as he finds them. His ideal\nis constructed not of pure reason or poetry, but from careful and\nsympathetic study of a wide range of facts. His criticism of Plato in\nthe light of history, in Book II. chap, v., though as a criticism it is\ncuriously inept, reveals his own attitude admirably: \"Let us remember\nthat we should not disregard the experience of ages; in the multitude\nof years, these things, if they were good, would certainly not have been\nunknown; for almost everything has been found out, although sometimes\nthey are not put together; in other cases men do not use the knowledge\nwhich they have.\" Aristotle in his Constitutions had made a study of one\nhundred and fifty-eight constitutions of the states of his day, and the\nfruits of that study are seen in the continual reference to concrete\npolitical experience, which makes the Politics in some respects a\ncritical history of the workings of the institutions of the Greek city\nstate. In Books IV., V., and VI. the ideal state seems far away, and\nwe find a dispassionate survey of imperfect states, the best ways of\npreserving them, and an analysis of the causes of their instability.\nIt is as though Aristotle were saying: \"I have shown you the proper and\nnormal type of constitution, but if you will not have it and insist on\nliving under a perverted form, you may as well know how to make the best\nof it.\" In this way the Politics, though it defines the state in the\nlight of its ideal, discusses states and institutions as they are.\nOstensibly it is merely a continuation of the Ethics, but it comes to\ntreat political questions from a purely political standpoint.\nThis combination of idealism and respect for the teachings of experience\nconstitutes in some ways the strength and value of the Politics, but it\nalso makes it harder to follow. The large nation states to which we are\naccustomed make it difficult for us to think that the state could be\nconstructed and modelled to express the good life. We can appreciate\nAristotle's critical analysis of constitutions, but find it hard to take\nseriously his advice to the legislator. Moreover, the idealism and the\nempiricism of the Politics are never really reconciled by Aristotle\nhimself.\nIt may help to an understanding of the Politics if something is said on\nthose two points.\nWe are accustomed since the growth of the historical method to the\nbelief that states are \"not made but grow,\" and are apt to be impatient\nwith the belief which Aristotle and Plato show in the powers of the\nlawgiver. But however true the maxim may be of the modern nation state,\nit was not true of the much smaller and more self-conscious Greek city.\nWhen Aristotle talks of the legislator, he is not talking in the\nair. Students of the Academy had been actually called on to give new\nconstitutions to Greek states. For the Greeks the constitution was not\nmerely as it is so often with us, a matter of political machinery. It\nwas regarded as a way of life. Further, the constitution within the\nframework of which the ordinary process of administration and passing\nof decrees went on, was always regarded as the work of a special man or\nbody of men, the lawgivers. If we study Greek history, we find that the\nposition of the legislator corresponds to that assigned to him by\nPlato and Aristotle. All Greek states, except those perversions\nwhich Aristotle criticises as being \"above law,\" worked under rigid\nconstitutions, and the constitution was only changed when the whole\npeople gave a commission to a lawgiver to draw up a new one. Such was\nthe position of the AEsumnetes, whom Aristotle describes in Book III.\nchap, xiv., in earlier times, and of the pupils of the Academy in the\nfourth century. The lawgiver was not an ordinary politician. He was\na state doctor, called in to prescribe for an ailing constitution. So\nHerodotus recounts that when the people of Cyrene asked the oracle of\nDelphi to help them in their dissensions, the oracle told them to go to\nMantinea, and the Mantineans lent them Demonax, who acted as a \"setter\nstraight\" and drew up a new constitution for Cyrene. So again the\nMilesians, Herodotus tells us, were long troubled by civil discord, till\nthey asked help from Paros, and the Parians sent ten commissioners\nwho gave Miletus a new constitution. So the Athenians, when they were\nfounding their model new colony at Thurii, employed Hippodamus of\nMiletus, whom Aristotle mentions in Book II, as the best expert in\ntown-planning, to plan the streets of the city, and Protagoras as the\nbest expert in law-making, to give the city its laws. In the Laws Plato\nrepresents one of the persons of the dialogue as having been asked\nby the people of Gortyna to draw up laws for a colony which they were\nfounding. The situation described must have occurred frequently in\nactual life. The Greeks thought administration should be democratic and\nlaw-making the work of experts. We think more naturally of law-making\nas the special right of the people and administration as necessarily\nconfined to experts.\nAristotle's Politics, then, is a handbook for the legislator, the expert\nwho is to be called in when a state wants help. We have called him a\nstate doctor. It is one of the most marked characteristics of Greek\npolitical theory that Plato and Aristotle think of the statesman as one\nwho has knowledge of what ought to be done, and can help those who call\nhim in to prescribe for them, rather than one who has power to control\nthe forces of society. The desire of society for the statesman's\nadvice is taken for granted, Plato in the Republic says that a good\nconstitution is only possible when the ruler does not want to rule;\nwhere men contend for power, where they have not learnt to distinguish\nbetween the art of getting hold of the helm of state and the art of\nsteering, which alone is statesmanship, true politics is impossible.\nWith this position much that Aristotle has to say about government is in\nagreement. He assumes the characteristic Platonic view that all men seek\nthe good, and go wrong through ignorance, not through evil will, and so\nhe naturally regards the state as a community which exists for the sake\nof the good life. It is in the state that that common seeking after\nthe good which is the profoundest truth about men and nature becomes\nexplicit and knows itself. The state is for Aristotle prior to the\nfamily and the village, although it succeeds them in time, for only when\nthe state with its conscious organisation is reached can man understand\nthe secret of his past struggles after something he knew not what. If\nprimitive society is understood in the light of the state, the state is\nunderstood in the light of its most perfect form, when the good after\nwhich all societies are seeking is realised in its perfection. Hence for\nAristotle as for Plato, the natural state or the state as such is the\nideal state, and the ideal state is the starting-point of political\ninquiry.\nIn accordance with the same line of thought, imperfect states, although\ncalled perversions, are regarded by Aristotle as the result rather of\nmisconception and ignorance than of perverse will. They all represent,\nhe says, some kind of justice. Oligarchs and democrats go wrong in\ntheir conception of the good. They have come short of the perfect state\nthrough misunderstanding of the end or through ignorance of the proper\nmeans to the end. But if they are states at all, they embody some common\nconception of the good, some common aspirations of all their members.\nThe Greek doctrine that the essence of the state consists in community\nof purpose is the counterpart of the notion often held in modern times\nthat the essence of the state is force. The existence of force is for\nPlato and Aristotle a sign not of the state but of the state's failure.\nIt comes from the struggle between conflicting misconceptions of the\ngood. In so far as men conceive the good rightly they are united. The\nstate represents their common agreement, force their failure to make\nthat agreement complete. The cure, therefore, of political ills is\nknowledge of the good life, and the statesman is he who has such\nknowledge, for that alone can give men what they are always seeking.\nIf the state is the organisation of men seeking a common good, power and\npolitical position must be given to those who can forward this end. This\nis the principle expressed in Aristotle's account of political justice,\nthe principle of \"tools to those who can use them.\" As the aim of the\nstate is differently conceived, the qualifications for government\nwill vary. In the ideal state power will be given to the man with most\nknowledge of the good; in other states to the men who are most truly\ncapable of achieving that end which the citizens have set themselves\nto pursue. The justest distribution of political power is that in which\nthere is least waste of political ability.\nFurther, the belief that the constitution of a state is only the\noutward expression of the common aspirations and beliefs of its members,\nexplains the paramount political importance which Aristotle assigns to\neducation. It is the great instrument by which the legislator can ensure\nthat the future citizens of his state will share those common beliefs\nwhich make the state possible. The Greeks with their small states had\na far clearer apprehension than we can have of the dependence of a\nconstitution upon the people who have to work it.\nSuch is in brief the attitude in which Aristotle approaches political\nproblems, but in working out its application to men and institutions\nas they are, Aristotle admits certain compromises which are not really\nconsistent with it.\n1. Aristotle thinks of membership of a state as community in pursuit of\nthe good. He wishes to confine membership in it to those who are capable\nof that pursuit in the highest and most explicit manner. His citizens,\ntherefore, must be men of leisure, capable of rational thought upon\nthe end of life. He does not recognise the significance of that less\nconscious but deep-seated membership of the state which finds its\nexpression in loyalty and patriotism. His definition of citizen includes\nonly a small part of the population of any Greek city. He is forced to\nadmit that the state is not possible without the co-operation of men\nwhom he will not admit to membership in it, either because they are not\ncapable of sufficient rational appreciation of political ends, like the\nbarbarians whom he thought were natural slaves, or because the leisure\nnecessary for citizenship can only be gained by the work of the artisans\nwho by that very work make themselves incapable of the life which\nthey make possible for others. \"The artisan only attains excellence\nin proportion as he becomes a slave,\" and the slave is only a living\ninstrument of the good life. He exists for the state, but the state does\nnot exist for him.\n2. Aristotle in his account of the ideal state seems to waver between\ntwo ideals. There is the ideal of an aristocracy and the ideal of what\nhe calls constitutional government, a mixed constitution. The principle\nof \"tools to those who can use them\" ought to lead him, as it does\nPlato, to an aristocracy. Those who have complete knowledge of the good\nmust be few, and therefore Plato gave entire power in his state into\nthe hands of the small minority of philosopher guardians. It is in\naccordance with this principle that Aristotle holds that kingship is\nthe proper form of government when there is in the state one man of\ntranscendent virtue. At the same time, Aristotle always holds that\nabsolute government is not properly political, that government is not\nlike the rule of a shepherd over his sheep, but the rule of equals\nover equals. He admits that the democrats are right in insisting that\nequality is a necessary element in the state, though he thinks they do\nnot admit the importance of other equally necessary elements. Hence he\ncomes to say that ruling and being ruled over by turns is an essential\nfeature of constitutional government, which he admits as an alternative\nto aristocracy. The end of the state, which is to be the standard of the\ndistribution of political power, is conceived sometimes as a good for\nthe apprehension and attainment of which \"virtue\" is necessary and\nsufficient (this is the principle of aristocracy), and sometimes as a\nmore complex good, which needs for its attainment not only \"virtue\" but\nwealth and equality. This latter conception is the principle on which\nthe mixed constitution is based. This in its distribution of political\npower gives some weight to \"virtue,\" some to wealth, and some to mere\nnumber. But the principle of \"ruling and being ruled by turns\" is not\nreally compatible with an unmodified principle of \"tools to those who\ncan use them.\" Aristotle is right in seeing that political government\ndemands equality, not in the sense that all members of the state should\nbe equal in ability or should have equal power, but in the sense that\nnone of them can properly be regarded simply as tools with which the\nlegislator works, that each has a right to say what will be made of his\nown life. The analogy between the legislator and the craftsman on which\nPlato insists, breaks down because the legislator is dealing with men\nlike himself, men who can to some extent conceive their own end in life\nand cannot be treated merely as means to the end of the legislator. The\nsense of the value of \"ruling and being ruled in turn\" is derived from\nthe experience that the ruler may use his power to subordinate the\nlives of the citizens of the state not to the common good but to his\nown private purposes. In modern terms, it is a simple, rough-and-ready\nattempt to solve that constant problem of politics, how efficient\ngovernment is to be combined with popular control. This problem arises\nfrom the imperfection of human nature, apparent in rulers as well as in\nruled, and if the principle which attempts to solve it be admitted as a\nprinciple of importance in the formation of the best constitution, then\nthe starting-point of politics will be man's actual imperfection, not\nhis ideal nature. Instead, then, of beginning with a state which would\nexpress man's ideal nature, and adapting it as well as may be to man's\nactual shortcomings from that ideal, we must recognise that the state\nand all political machinery are as much the expression of man's weakness\nas of his ideal possibilities. The state is possible only because\nmen have common aspirations, but government, and political power, the\nexistence of officials who are given authority to act in the name of the\nwhole state, are necessary because men's community is imperfect, because\nman's social nature expresses itself in conflicting ways, in the clash\nof interests, the rivalry of parties, and the struggle of classes,\ninstead of in the united seeking after a common good. Plato and\nAristotle were familiar with the legislator who was called in by the\nwhole people, and they tended therefore to take the general will or\ncommon consent of the people for granted. Most political questions are\nconcerned with the construction and expression of the general will, and\nwith attempts to ensure that the political machinery made to express the\ngeneral will shall not be exploited for private or sectional ends.\nAristotle's mixed constitution springs from a recognition of sectional\ninterests in the state. For the proper relation between the claims of\n\"virtue,\" wealth, and numbers is to be based not upon their relative\nimportance in the good life, but upon the strength of the parties which\nthey represent. The mixed constitution is practicable in a state where\nthe middle class is strong, as only the middle class can mediate between\nthe rich and the poor. The mixed constitution will be stable if it\nrepresents the actual balance of power between different classes in the\nstate. When we come to Aristotle's analysis of existing constitutions,\nwe find that while he regards them as imperfect approximations to the\nideal, he also thinks of them as the result of the struggle between\nclasses. Democracy, he explains, is the government not of the many but\nof the poor; oligarchy a government not of the few but of the rich.\nAnd each class is thought of, not as trying to express an ideal, but as\nstruggling to acquire power or maintain its position. If ever the class\nexisted in unredeemed nakedness, it was in the Greek cities of the\nfourth century, and its existence is abundantly recognised by Aristotle.\nHis account of the causes of revolutions in Book V. shows how far were\nthe existing states of Greece from the ideal with which he starts.\nHis analysis of the facts forces him to look upon them as the scene\nof struggling factions. The causes of revolutions are not described as\nprimarily changes in the conception of the common good, but changes in\nthe military or economic power of the several classes in the state. The\naim which he sets before oligarchs or democracies is not the good life,\nbut simple stability or permanence of the existing constitution.\nWith this spirit of realism which pervades Books IV., V., and VI.\nthe idealism of Books I., II., VII., and VIII. is never reconciled.\nAristotle is content to call existing constitutions perversions of\nthe true form. But we cannot read the Politics without recognising\nand profiting from the insight into the nature of the state which is\nrevealed throughout. Aristotle's failure does not lie in this, that he\nis both idealist and realist, but that he keeps these two tendencies\ntoo far apart. He thinks too much of his ideal state, as something to\nbe reached once for all by knowledge, as a fixed type to which actual\nstates approximate or from which they are perversions. But if we are to\nthink of actual politics as intelligible in the light of the ideal, we\nmust think of that ideal as progressively revealed in history, not as\nsomething to be discovered by turning our back on experience and having\nrecourse to abstract reasoning. If we stretch forward from what exists\nto an ideal, it is to a better which may be in its turn transcended, not\nto a single immutable best. Aristotle found in the society of his\ntime men who were not capable of political reflection, and who, as he\nthought, did their best work under superintendence. He therefore called\nthem natural slaves. For, according to Aristotle, that is a man's\nnatural condition in which he does his best work. But Aristotle also\nthinks of nature as something fixed and immutable; and therefore\nsanctions the institution of slavery, which assumes that what men are\nthat they will always be, and sets up an artificial barrier to their\never becoming anything else. We see in Aristotle's defence of slavery\nhow the conception of nature as the ideal can have a debasing influence\nupon views of practical politics. His high ideal of citizenship offers\nto those who can satisfy its claims the prospect of a fair life;\nthose who fall short are deemed to be different in nature and shut out\nentirely from approach to the ideal.\nA.

Now this is\ncalled a city, and the society thereof a political society; for those\nwho think that the principles of a political, a regal, a family, and\na herile government are the same are mistaken, while they suppose that\neach of these differ in the numbers to whom their power extends, but\nnot in their constitution: so that with them a herile government is one\ncomposed of a very few, a domestic of more, a civil and a regal of still\nmore, as if there was no difference between a large family and a small\ncity, or that a regal government and a political one are the same, only\nthat in the one a single person is continually at the head of public\naffairs; in the other, that each member of the state has in his turn a\nshare in the government, and is at one time a magistrate, at another\na private person, according to the rules of political science. But now\nthis is not true, as will be evident to any one who will consider this\nquestion in the most approved method. As, in an inquiry into every other\nsubject, it is necessary to separate the different parts of which it is\ncompounded, till we arrive at their first elements, which are the most\nminute parts thereof; so by the same proceeding we shall acquire a\nknowledge of the primary parts of a city and see wherein they differ\nfrom each other, and whether the rules of art will give us any\nassistance in examining into each of these things which are mentioned.\nCHAPTER II\nNow if in this particular science any one would attend to its original\nseeds, and their first shoot, he would then as in others have the\nsubject perfectly before him; and perceive, in the first place, that it\nis requisite that those should be joined together whose species cannot\nexist without each other, as the male and the female, for the business\nof propagation; and this not through choice, but by that natural impulse\nwhich acts both upon plants and animals also, for the purpose of their\nleaving behind them others like themselves. It is also from natural\ncauses that some beings command and others obey, that each may obtain\ntheir mutual safety; for a being who is endowed with a mind capable\nof reflection and forethought is by nature the superior and governor,\nwhereas he whose excellence is merely corporeal is formect to be a\nslave; whence it follows that the different state of master [1252b] and\nslave is equally advantageous to both. But there is a natural difference\nbetween a female and a slave: for nature is not like the artists\nwho make the Delphic swords for the use of the poor, but for every\nparticular purpose she has her separate instruments, and thus her ends\nare most complete, for whatsoever is employed on one subject only,\nbrings that one to much greater perfection than when employed on many;\nand yet among the barbarians, a female and a slave are upon a level in\nthe community, the reason for which is, that amongst them there are none\nqualified by nature to govern, therefore their society can be nothing\nbut between slaves of different sexes. For which reason the poets say,\nit is proper for the Greeks to govern the barbarians, as if a barbarian\nand a slave were by nature one. Now of these two societies the domestic\nis the first, and Hesiod is right when he says, \"First a house, then\na wife, then an ox for the plough,\" for the poor man has always an ox\nbefore a household slave. That society then which nature has established\nfor daily support is the domestic, and those who compose it are called\nby Charondas _homosipuoi_, and by Epimenides the Cretan _homokapnoi_;\nbut the society of many families, which was first instituted for their\nlasting, mutual advantage, is called a village, and a village is most\nnaturally composed of the descendants of one family, whom some persons\ncall homogalaktes, the children and the children's children thereof: for\nwhich reason cities were originally governed by kings, as the barbarian\nstates now are, which are composed of those who had before submitted to\nkingly government; for every family is governed by the elder, as are the\nbranches thereof, on account of their relationship thereunto, which\nis what Homer says, \"Each one ruled his wife and child;\" and in this\nscattered manner they formerly lived. And the opinion which universally\nprevails, that the gods themselves are subject to kingly government,\narises from hence, that all men formerly were, and many are so now; and\nas they imagined themselves to be made in the likeness of the gods, so\nthey supposed their manner of life must needs be the same. And when many\nvillages so entirely join themselves together as in every respect to\nform but one society, that society is a city, and contains in itself, if\nI may so speak, the end and perfection of government: first founded that\nwe might live, but continued that we may live happily. For which reason\nevery city must be allowed to be the work of nature, if we admit that\nthe original society between male and female is; for to this as their\nend all subordinate societies tend, and the end of everything is the\nnature of it. For what every being is in its most perfect state, that\ncertainly is the nature of that being, whether it be a man, a horse, or\na house: besides, whatsoever produces the final cause and the end which\nwe [1253a] desire, must be best; but a government complete in itself is\nthat final cause and what is best. Hence it is evident that a city is\na natural production, and that man is naturally a political animal, and\nthat whosoever is naturally and not accidentally unfit for society, must\nbe either inferior or superior to man: thus the man in Homer, who is\nreviled for being \"without society, without law, without family.\" Such\na one must naturally be of a quarrelsome disposition, and as solitary as\nthe birds. The gift of speech also evidently proves that man is a more\nsocial animal than the bees, or any of the herding cattle: for nature,\nas we say, does nothing in vain, and man is the only animal who enjoys\nit. Voice indeed, as being the token of pleasure and pain, is imparted\nto others also, and thus much their nature is capable of, to perceive\npleasure and pain, and to impart these sensations to others; but it is\nby speech that we are enabled to express what is useful for us, and what\nis hurtful, and of course what is just and what is unjust: for in\nthis particular man differs from other animals, that he alone has\na perception of good and evil, of just and unjust, and it is a\nparticipation of these common sentiments which forms a family and a\ncity. Besides, the notion of a city naturally precedes that of a family\nor an individual, for the whole must necessarily be prior to the parts,\nfor if you take away the whole man, you cannot say a foot or a hand\nremains, unless by equivocation, as supposing a hand of stone to be\nmade, but that would only be a dead one; but everything is understood to\nbe this or that by its energic qualities and powers, so that when these\nno longer remain, neither can that be said to be the same, but something\nof the same name. That a city then precedes an individual is plain,\nfor if an individual is not in himself sufficient to compose a perfect\ngovernment, he is to a city as other parts are to a whole; but he that\nis incapable of society, or so complete in himself as not to want it,\nmakes no part of a city, as a beast or a god. There is then in all\npersons a natural impetus to associate with each other in this manner,\nand he who first founded civil society was the cause of the greatest\ngood; for as by the completion of it man is the most excellent of all\nliving beings, so without law and justice he would be the worst of all,\nfor nothing is so difficult to subdue as injustice in arms: but these\narms man is born with, namely, prudence and valour, which he may apply\nto the most opposite purposes, for he who abuses them will be the most\nwicked, the most cruel, the most lustful, and most gluttonous being\nimaginable; for justice is a political virtue, by the rules of it the\nstate is regulated, and these rules are the criterion of what is right.\nCHAPTER III\nSINCE it is now evident of what parts a city is composed, it will be\nnecessary to treat first of family government, for every city is made\nup of families, and every family [1253b] has again its separate parts of\nwhich it is composed. When a family is complete, it consists of freemen\nand slaves; but as in every subject we should begin with examining into\nthe smallest parts of which it consists, and as the first and smallest\nparts of a family are the master and slave, the husband and wife, the\nfather and child, let us first inquire into these three, what each of\nthem may be, and what they ought to be; that is to say, the herile, the\nnuptial, and the paternal. Let these then be considered as the three\ndistinct parts of a family: some think that the providing what is\nnecessary for the family is something different from the government of\nit, others that this is the greatest part of it; it shall be considered\nseparately; but we will first speak of a master and a slave, that we\nmay both understand the nature of those things which are absolutely\nnecessary, and also try if we can learn anything better on this subject\nthan what is already known. Some persons have thought that the power of\nthe master over his slave originates from his superior knowledge, and\nthat this knowledge is the same in the master, the magistrate, and the\nking, as we have already said; but others think that herile government\nis contrary to nature, and that it is the law which makes one man a\nslave and another free, but that in nature there is no difference; for\nwhich reason that power cannot be founded in justice, but in force.\nCHAPTER IV\nSince then a subsistence is necessary in every family, the means of\nprocuring it certainly makes up part of the management of a family, for\nwithout necessaries it is impossible to live, and to live well. As\nin all arts which are brought to perfection it is necessary that they\nshould have their proper instruments if they would complete their works,\nso is it in the art of managing a family: now of instruments some of\nthem are alive, others inanimate; thus with respect to the pilot of the\nship, the tiller is without life, the sailor is alive; for a servant\nis as an instrument in many arts. Thus property is as an instrument\nto living; an estate is a multitude of instruments; so a slave is an\nanimated instrument, but every one that can minister of himself is more\nvaluable than any other instrument; for if every instrument, at command,\nor from a preconception of its master's will, could accomplish its work\n(as the story goes of the statues of Daedalus; or what the poet tells us\nof the tripods of Vulcan, \"that they moved of their own accord into the\nassembly of the gods \"), the shuttle would then weave, and the lyre play\nof itself; nor would the architect want servants, or the [1254a] master\nslaves. Now what are generally called instruments are the efficients\nof something else, but possessions are what we simply use: thus with a\nshuttle we make something else for our use; but we only use a coat, or a\nbed: since then making and using differ from each other in species, and\nthey both require their instruments, it is necessary that these should\nbe different from each other. Now life is itself what we use, and not\nwhat we employ as the efficient of something else; for which reason the\nservices of a slave are for use. A possession may be considered in the\nsame nature as a part of anything; now a part is not only a part of\nsomething, but also is nothing else; so is a possession; therefore a\nmaster is only the master of the slave, but no part of him; but the\nslave is not only the slave of the master, but nothing else but that.\nThis fully explains what is the nature of a slave, and what are his\ncapacities; for that being who by nature is nothing of himself, but\ntotally another's, and is a man, is a slave by nature; and that man who\nis the property of another, is his mere chattel, though he continues a\nman; but a chattel is an instrument for use, separate from the body.\nCHAPTER V\nBut whether any person is such by nature, and whether it is advantageous\nand just for any one to be a slave or no, or whether all slavery is\ncontrary to nature, shall be considered hereafter; not that it is\ndifficult to determine it upon general principles, or to understand\nit from matters of fact; for that some should govern, and others be\ngoverned, is not only necessary but useful, and from the hour of their\nbirth some are marked out for those purposes, and others for the other,\nand there are many species of both sorts. And the better those are who\nare governed the better also is the government, as for instance of man,\nrather than the brute creation: for the more excellent the materials\nare with which the work is finished, the more excellent certainly is the\nwork; and wherever there is a governor and a governed, there certainly\nis some work produced; for whatsoever is composed of many parts, which\njointly become one, whether conjunct or separate, evidently show the\nmarks of governing and governed; and this is true of every living thing\nin all nature; nay, even in some things which partake not of life, as\nin music; but this probably would be a disquisition too foreign to our\npresent purpose. Every living thing in the first place is composed of\nsoul and body, of these the one is by nature the governor, the other the\ngoverned; now if we would know what is natural, we ought to search for\nit in those subjects in which nature appears most perfect, and not in\nthose which are corrupted; we should therefore examine into a man who\nis most perfectly formed both in soul and body, in whom this is evident,\nfor in the depraved and vicious the body seems [1254b] to rule rather\nthan the soul, on account of their being corrupt and contrary to nature.\nWe may then, as we affirm, perceive in an animal the first principles\nof herile and political government; for the soul governs the body as the\nmaster governs his slave; the mind governs the appetite with a political\nor a kingly power, which shows that it is both natural and advantageous\nthat the body should be governed by the soul, and the pathetic part by\nthe mind, and that part which is possessed of reason; but to have no\nruling power, or an improper one, is hurtful to all; and this holds\ntrue not only of man, but of other animals also, for tame animals are\nnaturally better than wild ones, and it is advantageous that both should\nbe under subjection to man; for this is productive of their common\nsafety: so is it naturally with the male and the female; the one is\nsuperior, the other inferior; the one governs, the other is governed;\nand the same rule must necessarily hold good with respect to all\nmankind. Those men therefore who are as much inferior to others as the\nbody is to the soul, are to be thus disposed of, as the proper use of\nthem is their bodies, in which their excellence consists; and if what I\nhave said be true, they are slaves by nature, and it is advantageous to\nthem to be always under government. He then is by nature formed a slave\nwho is qualified to become the chattel of another person, and on that\naccount is so, and who has just reason enough to know that there is such\na faculty, without being indued with the use of it; for other animals\nhave no perception of reason, but are entirely guided by appetite,\nand indeed they vary very little in their use from each other; for the\nadvantage which we receive, both from slaves and tame animals, arises\nfrom their bodily strength administering to our necessities; for it\nis the intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and freemen\ndifferent from each other, that the one should be robust for their\nnecessary purposes, the others erect, useless indeed for what slaves are\nemployed in, but fit for civil life, which is divided into the duties of\nwar and peace; though these rules do not always take place, for slaves\nhave sometimes the bodies of freemen, sometimes the souls; if then it\nis evident that if some bodies are as much more excellent than others as\nthe statues of the gods excel the human form, every one will allow that\nthe inferior ought to be slaves to the superior; and if this is true\nwith respect to the body, it is still juster to determine in the same\nmanner, when we consider the soul; though it is not so easy to perceive\nthe beauty of [1255a] the soul as it is of the body. Since then some\nmen are slaves by nature, and others are freemen, it is clear that where\nslavery is advantageous to any one, then it is just to make him a slave.\nCHAPTER VI\nBut it is not difficult to perceive that those who maintain the contrary\nopinion have some reason on their side; for a man may become a slave two\ndifferent ways; for he may be so by law also, and this law is a certain\ncompact, by which whatsoever is taken in battle is adjudged to be the\nproperty of the conquerors: but many persons who are conversant in law\ncall in question this pretended right, and say that it would be hard\nthat a man should be compelled by violence to be the slave and subject\nof another who had the power to compel him, and was his superior in\nstrength; and upon this subject, even of those who are wise, some think\none way and some another; but the cause of this doubt and variety of\nopinions arises from hence, that great abilities, when accompanied with\nproper means, are generally able to succeed by force: for victory is\nalways owing to a superiority in some advantageous circumstances; so\nthat it seems that force never prevails but in consequence of great\nabilities. But still the dispute concerning the justice of it remains;\nfor some persons think, that justice consists in benevolence, others\nthink it just that the powerful should govern: in the midst of these\ncontrary opinions, there are no reasons sufficient to convince us, that\nthe right of being master and governor ought not to be placed with those\nwho have the greatest abilities. Some persons, entirely resting upon the\nright which the law gives (for that which is legal is in some respects\njust), insist upon it that slavery occasioned by war is just, not that\nthey say it is wholly so, for it may happen that the principle upon\nwhich the wars were commenced is unjust; moreover no one will say that a\nman who is unworthily in slavery is therefore a slave; for if so, men of\nthe noblest families might happen to be slaves, and the descendants of\nslaves, if they should chance to be taken prisoners in war and sold: to\navoid this difficulty they say that such persons should not be called\nslaves, but barbarians only should; but when they say this, they do\nnothing more than inquire who is a slave by nature, which was what we\nat first said; for we must acknowledge that there are some persons\nwho, wherever they are, must necessarily be slaves, but others in no\nsituation; thus also it is with those of noble descent: it is not only\nin their own country that they are Esteemed as such, but everywhere,\nbut the barbarians are respected on this account at home only; as if\nnobility and freedom were of two sorts, the one universal, the other not\nso. Thus says the Helen of Theodectes:\n\"Who dares reproach me with the name of slave? When from the\nimmortal gods, on either side, I draw my lineage.\"\nThose who express sentiments like these, shew only that they distinguish\nthe slave and the freeman, the noble and the ignoble from each other\nby their virtues and their [1255b] vices; for they think it reasonable,\nthat as a man begets a man, and a beast a beast, so from a good man, a\ngood man should be descended; and this is what nature desires to do, but\nfrequently cannot accomplish it. It is evident then that this doubt\nhas some reason in it, and that these persons are not slaves, and those\nfreemen, by the appointment of nature; and also that in some instances\nit is sufficiently clear, that it is advantageous to both parties for\nthis man to be a slave, and that to be a master, and that it is right\nand just, that some should be governed, and others govern, in the manner\nthat nature intended; of which sort of government is that which a master\nexercises over a slave. But to govern ill is disadvantageous to both;\nfor the same thing is useful to the part and to the whole, to the body\nand to the soul; but the slave is as it were a part of the master, as if\nhe were an animated part of his body, though separate. For which reason\na mutual utility and friendship may subsist between the master and the\nslave, I mean when they are placed by nature in that relation to each\nother, for the contrary takes place amongst those who are reduced to\nslavery by the law, or by conquest.\nCHAPTER VII\nIt is evident from what has been said, that a herile and a political\ngovernment are not the same, or that all governments are alike to each\nother, as some affirm; for one is adapted to the nature of freemen, the\nother to that of slaves. Domestic government is a monarchy, for that is\nwhat prevails in every house; but a political state is the government of\nfree men and equals. The master is not so called from his knowing how to\nmanage his slave, but because he is so; for the same reason a slave and\na freeman have their respective appellations. There is also one sort of\nknowledge proper for a master, another for a slave; the slave's is of\nthe nature of that which was taught by a slave at Syracuse; for he for\na stipulated sum instructed the boys in all the business of a household\nslave, of which there are various sorts to be learnt, as the art of\ncookery, and other such-like services, of which some are allotted to\nsome, and others to others; some employments being more honourable,\nothers more necessary; according to the proverb, \"One slave excels\nanother, one master excels another:\" in such-like things the knowledge\nof a slave consists. The knowledge of the master is to be able properly\nto employ his slaves, for the mastership of slaves is the employment,\nnot the mere possession of them; not that this knowledge contains\nanything great or respectable; for what a slave ought to know how to do,\nthat a master ought to know how to order; for which reason, those who\nhave it in their power to be free from these low attentions, employ a\nsteward for this business, and apply themselves either to public affairs\nor philosophy: the knowledge of procuring what is necessary for a family\nis different from that which belongs either to the master or the slave:\nand to do this justly must be either by war or hunting. And thus much of\nthe difference between a master and a slave.\nCHAPTER VIII\n[1256a] As a slave is a particular species of property, let us by\nall means inquire into the nature of property in general, and the\nacquisition of money, according to the manner we have proposed. In the\nfirst place then, some one may doubt whether the getting of money is\nthe same thing as economy, or whether it is a part of it, or something\nsubservient to it; and if so, whether it is as the art of making\nshuttles is to the art of weaving, or the art of making brass to that\nof statue founding, for they are not of the same service; for the one\nsupplies the tools, the other the matter: by the matter I mean the\nsubject out of which the work is finished, as wool for the cloth and\nbrass for the statue. It is evident then that the getting of money is\nnot the same thing as economy, for the business of the one is to furnish\nthe means of the other to use them; and what art is there employed in\nthe management of a family but economy, but whether this is a part of\nit, or something of a different species, is a doubt; for if it is\nthe business of him who is to get money to find out how riches and\npossessions may be procured, and both these arise from various\ncauses, we must first inquire whether the art of husbandry is part of\nmoney-getting or something different, and in general, whether the same\nis not true of every acquisition and every attention which relates to\nprovision. But as there are many sorts of provision, so are the methods\nof living both of man and the brute creation very various; and as it is\nimpossible to live without food, the difference in that particular makes\nthe lives of animals so different from each other. Of beasts, some\nlive in herds, others separate, as is most convenient for procuring\nthemselves food; as some of them live upon flesh, others on fruit, and\nothers on whatsoever they light on, nature having so distinguished\ntheir course of life, that they can very easily procure themselves\nsubsistence; and as the same things are not agreeable to all, but one\nanimal likes one thing and another another, it follows that the lives\nof those beasts who live upon flesh must be different from the lives of\nthose who live on fruits; so is it with men, their lives differ greatly\nfrom each other; and of all these the shepherd's is the idlest, for they\nlive upon the flesh of tame animals, without any trouble, while they are\nobliged to change their habitations on account of their flocks, which\nthey are compelled to follow, cultivating, as it were, a living farm.\nOthers live exercising violence over living creatures, one pursuing this\nthing, another that, these preying upon men; those who live near lakes\nand marshes and rivers, or the sea itself, on fishing, while others are\nfowlers, or hunters of wild beasts; but the greater part of mankind live\nupon the produce of the earth and its cultivated fruits; and the manner\nin which all those live who follow the direction of nature, and labour\nfor their own subsistence, is nearly the same, without ever thinking\nto procure any provision by way of exchange or merchandise, such are\nshepherds, husband-men, [1256b] robbers, fishermen, and hunters: some\njoin different employments together, and thus live very agreeably;\nsupplying those deficiencies which were wanting to make their\nsubsistence depend upon themselves only: thus, for instance, the same\nperson shall be a shepherd and a robber, or a husbandman and a hunter;\nand so with respect to the rest, they pursue that mode of life which\nnecessity points out. This provision then nature herself seems to have\nfurnished all animals with, as well immediately upon their first origin\nas also when they are arrived at a state of maturity; for at the first\nof these periods some of them are provided in the womb with proper\nnourishment, which continues till that which is born can get food for\nitself, as is the case with worms and birds; and as to those which bring\nforth their young alive, they have the means for their subsistence for a\ncertain time within themselves, namely milk. It is evident then that we\nmay conclude of those things that are, that plants are created for the\nsake of animals, and animals for the sake of men; the tame for our use\nand provision; the wild, at least the greater part, for our provision\nalso, or for some other advantageous purpose, as furnishing us with\nclothes, and the like. As nature therefore makes nothing either\nimperfect or in vain, it necessarily follows that she has made all these\nthings for men: for which reason what we gain in war is in a certain\ndegree a natural acquisition; for hunting is a part of it, which it is\nnecessary for us to employ against wild beasts; and those men who being\nintended by nature for slavery are unwilling to submit to it, on which\noccasion such a. war is by nature just: that species of acquisition then\nonly which is according to nature is part of economy; and this ought to\nbe at hand, or if not, immediately procured, namely, what is necessary\nto be kept in store to live upon, and which are useful as well for the\nstate as the family. And true riches seem to consist in these; and the\nacquisition of those possessions which are necessary for a happy life is\nnot infinite; though Solon says otherwise in this verse:\n\"No bounds to riches can be fixed for man;\"\nfor they may be fixed as in other arts; for the instruments of no art\nwhatsoever are infinite, either in their number or their magnitude; but\nriches are a number of instruments in domestic and civil economy; it is\ntherefore evident that the acquisition of certain things according\nto nature is a part both of domestic and civil economy, and for what\nreason.\nCHAPTER IX\nThere is also another species of acquisition which they [1257a]\nparticularly call pecuniary, and with great propriety; and by this\nindeed it seems that there are no bounds to riches and wealth. Now many\npersons suppose, from their near relation to each other, that this is\none and the same with that we have just mentioned, but it is not the\nsame as that, though not very different; one of these is natural, the\nother is not, but rather owing to some art and skill; we will enter into\na particular examination of this subject. The uses of every possession\nare two, both dependent upon the thing itself, but not in the same\nmanner, the one supposing an inseparable connection with it, the other\nnot; as a shoe, for instance, which may be either worn, or exchanged\nfor something else, both these are the uses of the shoe; for he who\nexchanges a shoe with some man who wants one, for money or provisions,\nuses the shoe as a shoe, but not according to the original intention,\nfor shoes were not at first made to be exchanged. The same thing holds\ntrue of all other possessions; for barter, in general, had its original\nbeginning in nature, some men having a surplus, others too little of\nwhat was necessary for them: hence it is evident, that the selling\nprovisions for money is not according to the natural use of things; for\nthey were obliged to use barter for those things which they wanted; but\nit is plain that barter could have no place in the first, that is to\nsay, in family society; but must have begun when the number of those\nwho composed the community was enlarged: for the first of these had all\nthings in common; but when they came to be separated they were obliged\nto exchange with each other many different things which both parties\nwanted. Which custom of barter is still preserved amongst many barbarous\nnations, who procure one necessary with another, but never sell\nanything; as giving and receiving wine for corn and the like. This\nsort of barter is not contradictory to nature, nor is it any species of\nmoney-getting; but is necessary in procuring that subsistence which is\nso consonant thereunto. But this barter introduced the use of money, as\nmight be expected; for a convenient place from whence to import what you\nwanted, or to export what you had a surplus of, being often at a great\ndistance, money necessarily made its way into commerce; for it is not\neverything which is naturally most useful that is easiest of carriage;\nfor which reason they invented something to exchange with each other\nwhich they should mutually give and take, that being really valuable\nitself, should have the additional advantage of being of easy\nconveyance, for the purposes of life, as iron and silver, or anything\nelse of the same nature: and this at first passed in value simply\naccording to its weight or size; but in process of time it had a certain\nstamp, to save the trouble of weighing, which stamp expressed its value.\n[1257b]\nMoney then being established as the necessary medium of exchange,\nanother species of money-getting soon took place, namely, by buying\nand selling, at probably first in a simple manner, afterwards with more\nskill and experience, where and how the greatest profits might be made.\nFor which reason the art of money-getting seems to be chiefly conversant\nabout trade, and the business of it to be able to tell where the\ngreatest profits can be made, being the means of procuring abundance\nof wealth and possessions: and thus wealth is very often supposed to\nconsist in the quantity of money which any one possesses, as this is the\nmedium by which all trade is conducted and a fortune made, others again\nregard it as of no value, as being of none by nature, but arbitrarily\nmade so by compact; so that if those who use it should alter their\nsentiments, it would be worth nothing, as being of no service for\nany necessary purpose. Besides, he who abounds in money often wants\nnecessary food; and it is impossible to say that any person is in good\ncircumstances when with all his possessions he may perish with hunger.\nLike Midas in the fable, who from his insatiable wish had everything he\ntouched turned into gold. For which reason others endeavour to procure\nother riches and other property, and rightly, for there are other riches\nand property in nature; and these are the proper objects of economy:\nwhile trade only procures money, not by all means, but by the exchange\nof it, and for that purpose it is this which it is chiefly employed\nabout, for money is the first principle and the end of trade; nor are\nthere any bounds to be set to what is thereby acquired. Thus also there\nare no limits to the art of medicine, with respect to the health which\nit attempts to procure; the same also is true of all other arts; no line\ncan be drawn to terminate their bounds, the several professors of them\nbeing desirous to extend them as far as possible. (But still the means\nto be employed for that purpose are limited; and these are the limits\nbeyond which the art cannot proceed.) Thus in the art of acquiring\nriches there are no limits, for the object of that is money and\npossessions; but economy has a boundary, though this has not: for\nacquiring riches is not the business of that, for which reason it should\nseem that some boundary should be set to riches, though we see the\ncontrary to this is what is practised; for all those who get riches add\nto their money without end; the cause of which is the near connection\nof these two arts with each other, which sometimes occasions the one to\nchange employments with the other, as getting of money is their common\nobject: for economy requires the possession of wealth, but not on\nits own account but with another view, to purchase things necessary\ntherewith; but the other procures it merely to increase it: so that some\npersons are confirmed in their belief, that this is the proper object\nof economy, and think that for this purpose money should be saved and\nhoarded up without end; the reason for which disposition is, that they\nare intent upon living, but not upon living well; and this desire being\nboundless in its extent, the means which they aim at for that purpose\nare boundless also; and those who propose to live well, often confine\nthat to the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense; so that as this also\nseems to depend upon what a man has, all their care is to get money,\nand hence arises the other cause for this art; for as this enjoyment is\nexcessive in its degree, they endeavour to procure means proportionate\nto supply it; and if they cannot do this merely by the art of dealing in\nmoney, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply all their\npowers to a purpose they were not by nature intended for. Thus, for\ninstance, courage was intended to inspire fortitude, not to get money\nby; neither is this the end of the soldier's or the physician's art,\nbut victory and health. But such persons make everything subservient to\nmoney-getting, as if this was the only end; and to the end everything\nought to refer.\nWe have now considered that art of money-getting which is not necessary,\nand have seen in what manner we became in want of it; and also that\nwhich is necessary, which is different from it; for that economy which\nis natural, and whose object is to provide food, is not like this\nunlimited in its extent, but has its bounds.\nCHAPTER X\nWe have now determined what was before doubtful, whether or no the art\nof getting money is his business who is at the head of a family or a\nstate, and though not strictly so, it is however very necessary; for\nas a politician does not make men, but receiving them from the hand of\nnature employs them to proper purposes; thus the earth, or the sea, or\nsomething else ought to supply them with provisions, and this it is the\nbusiness of the master of the family to manage properly; for it is not\nthe weaver's business to make yarn, but to use it, and to distinguish\nwhat is good and useful from what is bad and of no service; and indeed\nsome one may inquire why getting money should be a part of economy when\nthe art of healing is not, as it is as requisite that the family should\nbe in health as that they should eat, or have anything else which is\nnecessary; and as it is indeed in some particulars the business both of\nthe master of the family, and he to whom the government of the state\nis entrusted, to see after the health of those under their care, but in\nothers not, but the physician's; so also as to money; in some respects\nit is the business of the master of the family, in others not, but of\nthe servant; but as we have already said, it is chiefly nature's, for\nit is her part to supply her offspring with food; for everything finds\nnourishment left for it in what produced it; for which reason\nthe natural riches of all men arise from fruits and animals. Now\nmoney-making, as we say, being twofold, it may be applied to two\npurposes, the service of the house or retail trade; of which the first\nis necessary and commendable, the other justly censurable; for it has\nnot its origin in [1258b] nature, but by it men gain from each other;\nfor usury is most reasonably detested, as it is increasing our fortune\nby money itself, and not employing it for the purpose it was originally\nintended, namely exchange.\nAnd this is the explanation of the name (TOKOS), which means the\nbreeding of money. For as offspring resemble their parents, so usury\nis money bred of money. Whence of all forms of money-making it is most\nagainst nature.\nCHAPTER XI\nHaving already sufficiently considered the general principles of this\nsubject, let us now go into the practical part thereof; the one is a\nliberal employment for the mind, the other necessary. These things are\nuseful in the management of one's affairs; to be skilful in the nature\nof cattle, which are most profitable, and where, and how; as for\ninstance, what advantage will arise from keeping horses, or oxen, or\nsheep, or any other live stock; it is also necessary to be acquainted\nwith the comparative value of these things, and which of them in\nparticular places are worth most; for some do better in one place, some\nin another. Agriculture also should be understood, and the management\nof arable grounds and orchards; and also the care of bees, and fish, and\nbirds, from whence any profit may arise; these are the first and most\nproper parts of domestic management.\nWith respect to gaining money by exchange, the principal method of doing\nthis is by merchandise, which is carried on in three different ways,\neither by sending the commodity for sale by sea or by land, or else\nselling it on the place where it grows; and these differ from each other\nin this, that the one is more profitable, the other safer. The second\nmethod is by usury. The third by receiving wages for work done, and\nthis either by being employed in some mean art, or else in mere bodily\nlabour. There is also a third species of improving a fortune, that is\nsomething between this and the first; for it partly depends upon\nnature, partly upon exchange; the subject of which is, things that are\nimmediately from the earth, or their produce, which, though they bear\nno fruit, are yet useful, such as selling of timber and the whole art of\nmetallurgy, which includes many different species, for there are various\nsorts of things dug out of the earth.\nThese we have now mentioned in general, but to enter into particulars\nconcerning each of them, though it might be useful to the artist, would\nbe tiresome to dwell on. Now of all the works of art, those are the most\nexcellent wherein chance has the least to do, and those are the meanest\nwhich deprave the body, those the most servile in which bodily strength\nalone is chiefly wanted, those most illiberal which require least skill;\nbut as there are books written on these subjects by some persons, as\nby Chares the Panian, and Apollodorus the Lemnian, upon husbandry and\nplanting; and by others on other matters, [1259b] let those who have\noccasion consult them thereon; besides, every person should collect\ntogether whatsoever he hears occasionally mentioned, by means of which\nmany of those who aimed at making a fortune have succeeded in their\nintentions; for all these are useful to those who make a point of\ngetting money, as in the contrivance of Thales the Milesian (which was\ncertainly a gainful one, but as it was his it was attributed to\nhis wisdom, though the method he used was a general one, and would\nuniversally succeed), when they reviled him for his poverty, as if the\nstudy of philosophy was useless: for they say that he, perceiving by his\nskill in astrology that there would be great plenty of olives that year,\nwhile it was yet winter, having got a little money, he gave earnest for\nall the oil works that were in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a\nlow price, there being no one to bid against him; but when the season\ncame for making oil, many persons wanting them, he all at once let them\nupon what terms he pleased; and raising a large sum of money by that\nmeans, convinced them that it was easy for philosophers to be rich if\nthey chose it, but that that was not what they aimed at; in this manner\nis Thales said to have shown his wisdom. It indeed is, as we have\nsaid, generally gainful for a person to contrive to make a monopoly of\nanything; for which reason some cities also take this method when they\nwant money, and monopolise their commodities. There was a certain person\nin Sicily who laid out a sum of money which was deposited in his hand in\nbuying up all the iron from the iron merchants; so that when the dealers\ncame from the markets to purchase, there was no one had any to sell but\nhimself; and though he put no great advance upon it, yet by laying out\nfifty talents he made an hundred. When Dionysius heard this he permitted\nhim to take his money with him, but forbid him to continue any longer in\nSicily, as being one who contrived means for getting money inconsistent\nwith his affairs. This man's view and Thales's was exactly the same;\nboth of them contrived to procure a monopoly for themselves: it is\nuseful also for politicians to understand these things, for many states\nwant to raise money and by such means, as well as private families,\nnay more so; for which reason some persons who are employed in the\nmanagement of public affairs confine themselves to this province only.\nCHAPTER XII\nThere are then three parts of domestic government, the masters, of\nwhich we have already treated, the fathers, and the husbands; now the\ngovernment of the wife and children should both be that of free persons,\nbut not the [I259b] same; for the wife should be treated as a citizen of\na free state, the children should be under kingly power; for the male is\nby nature superior to the female, except when something happens contrary\nto the usual course of nature, as is the elder and perfect to the\nyounger and imperfect. Now in the generality of free states, the\ngovernors and the governed alternately change place; for an equality\nwithout any preference is what nature chooses; however, when one\ngoverns and another is governed, she endeavours that there should be a\ndistinction between them in forms, expressions, and honours; according\nto what Amasis said of his laver. This then should be the established\nrule between the man and the woman. The government of children should\nbe kingly; for the power of the father over the child is founded in\naffection and seniority, which is a species of kingly government; for\nwhich reason Homer very properly calls Jupiter \"the father of gods and\nmen,\" who was king of both these; for nature requires that a king should\nbe of the same species with those whom he governs, though superior in\nsome particulars, as is the case between the elder and the younger, the\nfather and the son.\nCHAPTER XIII\nIt is evident then that in the due government of a family, greater\nattention should be paid to the several members of it and their virtues\nthan to the possessions or riches of it; and greater to the freemen\nthan the slaves: but here some one may doubt whether there is any other\nvirtue in a slave than his organic services, and of higher estimation\nthan these, as temperance, fortitude, justice, and such-like habits, or\nwhether they possess only bodily qualities: each side of the question\nhas its difficulties; for if they possess these virtues, wherein do\nthey differ from freemen? and that they do not, since they are men,\nand partakers of reason, is absurd. Nearly the same inquiry may be made\nconcerning a woman and a child, whether these also have their proper\nvirtues; whether a woman ought to be temperate, brave, and just, and\nwhether a child is temperate or no; and indeed this inquiry ought to be\ngeneral, whether the virtues of those who, by nature, either govern or\nare governed, are the same or different; for if it is necessary that\nboth of them should partake of the fair and good, why is it also\nnecessary that, without exception, the one should govern, the other\nalways be governed? for this cannot arise from their possessing these\nqualities in different degrees; for to govern, and to be governed, are\nthings different in species, but more or less are not. And yet it is\nwonderful that one party ought to have them, and the other not; for if\nhe who is to govern should not be temperate and just, how can he govern\nwell? or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well? for he\nwho is intemperate [1260a] and a coward will never do what he ought: it\nis evident then that both parties ought to be virtuous; but there is a\ndifference between them, as there is between those who by nature command\nand who by nature obey, and this originates in the soul; for in this\nnature has planted the governing and submitting principle, the virtues\nof which we say are different, as are those of a rational and an\nirrational being. It is plain then that the same principle may be\nextended farther, and that there are in nature a variety of things which\ngovern and are governed; for a freeman is governed in a different manner\nfrom a slave, a male from a female, and a man from a child: and all\nthese have parts of mind within them, but in a different manner. Thus\na slave can have no power of determination, a woman but a weak one, a\nchild an imperfect one. Thus also must it necessarily be with respect to\nmoral virtues; all must be supposed to possess them, but not in the\nsame manner, but as is best suited to every one's employment; on which\naccount he who is to govern ought to be perfect in moral virtue, for his\nbusiness is entirely that of an architect, and reason is the architect;\nwhile others want only that portion of it which may be sufficient for\ntheir station; from whence it is evident, that although moral virtue is\ncommon to all those we have spoken of, yet the temperance of a man and\na woman are not the same, nor their courage, nor their justice, though\nSocrates thought otherwise; for the courage of the man consists in\ncommanding, the woman's in obeying; and the same is true in other\nparticulars: and this will be evident to those who will examine\ndifferent virtues separately; for those who use general terms deceive\nthemselves when they say, that virtue consists in a good disposition of\nmind, or doing what is right, or something of this sort. They do much\nbetter who enumerate the different virtues as Georgias did, than those\nwho thus define them; and as Sophocles speaks of a woman, we think\nof all persons, that their 'virtues should be applicable to their\ncharacters, for says he,\n\"Silence is a woman's ornament,\"\nbut it is not a man's; and as a child is incomplete, it is evident that\nhis virtue is not to be referred to himself in his present situation,\nbut to that in which he will be complete, and his preceptor. In like\nmanner the virtue of a slave is to be referred to his master; for we\nlaid it down as a maxim, that the use of a slave was to employ him in\nwhat you wanted; so that it is clear enough that few virtues are wanted\nin his station, only that he may not neglect his work through idleness\nor fear: some person may question if what I have said is true, whether\nvirtue is not necessary for artificers in their calling, for they often\nthrough idleness neglect their work, but the difference between them\nis very great; for a slave is connected with you for life, but the\nartificer not so nearly: as near therefore as the artificer approaches\nto the situation of a slave, just so much ought he to have of the\nvirtues of one; for a mean artificer is to a certain point a slave; but\nthen a slave is one of those things which are by nature what they are,\nbut this is not true [1260b] of a shoemaker, or any other artist. It is\nevident then that a slave ought to be trained to those virtues which are\nproper for his situation by his master; and not by him who has the power\nof a master, to teach him any particular art. Those therefore are in the\nwrong who would deprive slaves of reason, and say that they have only to\nfollow their orders; for slaves want more instruction than children, and\nthus we determine this matter. It is necessary, I am sensible, for every\none who treats upon government, to enter particularly into the relations\nof husband and wife, and of parent and child, and to show what are the\nvirtues of each and their respective connections with each other; what\nis right and what is wrong; and how the one ought to be followed, and\nthe other avoided. Since then every family is part of a city, and each\nof those individuals is part of a family, and the virtue of the parts\nought to correspond to the virtue of the whole; it is necessary, that\nboth the wives and children of the community should be instructed\ncorrespondent to the nature thereof, if it is of consequence to the\nvirtue of the state, that the wives and children therein should be\nvirtuous, and of consequence it certainly is, for the wives are one half\nof the free persons; and of the children the succeeding citizens are to\nbe formed. As then we have determined these points, we will leave\nthe rest to be spoken to in another place, as if the subject was now\nfinished; and beginning again anew, first consider the sentiments of\nthose who have treated of the most perfect forms of government.\nBOOK II\nCHAPTER I\nSince then we propose to inquire what civil society is of all others\nbest for those who have it in their power to live entirely as they wish,\nit is necessary to examine into the polity of those states which are\nallowed to be well governed; and if there should be any others which\nsome persons have described, and which appear properly regulated, to\nnote what is right and useful in them; and when we point out wherein\nthey have failed, let not this be imputed to an affectation of wisdom,\nfor it is because there are great defects in all those which are already\nestablished, that I have been induced to undertake this work. We will\nbegin with that part of the subject which naturally presents itself\nfirst to our consideration. The members of every state must of necessity\nhave all things in common, or some things common, and not others,\nor nothing at all common. To have nothing in common is evidently\nimpossible, for society itself is one species of [1261a] community; and\nthe first thing necessary thereunto is a common place of habitation,\nnamely the city, which must be one, and this every citizen must have a\nshare in. But in a government which is to be well founded, will it be\nbest to admit of a community in everything which is capable thereof, or\nonly in some particulars, but in others not? for it is possible that the\ncitizens may have their wives, and children, and goods in common, as\nin Plato's Commonwealth; for in that Socrates affirms that all these\nparticulars ought to be so. Which then shall we prefer? the custom which\nis already established, or the laws which are proposed in that treatise?\nCHAPTER II\nNow as a community of wives is attended with many other difficulties, so\nneither does the cause for which he would frame his government in this\nmanner seem agreeable to reason, nor is it capable of producing that end\nwhich he has proposed, and for which he says it ought to take place; nor\nhas he given any particular directions for putting it in practice. Now\nI also am willing to agree with Socrates in the principle which he\nproceeds upon, and admit that the city ought to be one as much as\npossible; and yet it is evident that if it is contracted too much, it\nwill be no longer a city, for that necessarily supposes a multitude; so\nthat if we proceed in this manner, we shall reduce a city to a family,\nand a family to a single person: for we admit that a family is one in a\ngreater degree than a city, and a single person than a family; so that\nif this end could be obtained, it should never be put in practice, as it\nwould annihilate the city; for a city does not only consist of a large\nnumber of inhabitants, but there must also be different sorts; for were\nthey all alike, there could be no city; for a confederacy and a city are\ntwo different things; for a confederacy is valuable from its numbers,\nalthough all those who compose it are men of the same calling; for this\nis entered into for the sake of mutual defence, as we add an additional\nweight to make the scale go down. The same distinction prevails between\na city and a nation when the people are not collected into separate\nvillages, but live as the Arcadians. Now those things in which a city\nshould be one are of different sorts, and in preserving an alternate\nreciprocation of power between these, the safety thereof consists (as\nI have already mentioned in my treatise on Morals), for amongst freemen\nand equals this is absolutely necessary; for all cannot govern at the\nsame time, but either by the year, or according to some other regulation\nor time, by which means every one in his turn will be in office; as\nif the shoemakers and carpenters should exchange occupations, and not\nalways be employed in the same calling. But as it is evidently better,\nthat these should continue to exercise their respective trades; so also\nin civil society, where it is possible, it would be better that the\ngovernment should continue in the same hands; but where it [1261b] is\nnot (as nature has made all men equal, and therefore it is just, be the\nadministration good or bad, that all should partake of it), there it is\nbest to observe a rotation, and let those who are their equals by turns\nsubmit to those who are at that time magistrates, as they will, in their\nturns, alternately be governors and governed, as if they were different\nmen: by the same method different persons will execute different\noffices. From hence it is evident, that a city cannot be one in the\nmanner that some persons propose; and that what has been said to be the\ngreatest good which it could enjoy, is absolutely its destruction, which\ncannot be: for the good of anything is that which preserves it.\nFor another reason also it is clear, that it is not for the best\nto endeavour to make a city too much one, because a family is more\nsufficient in itself than a single person, a city than a family; and\nindeed Plato supposes that a city owes its existence to that sufficiency\nin themselves which the members of it enjoy. If then this sufficiency is\nso desirable, the less the city is one the better.\nCHAPTER III\nBut admitting that it is most advantageous for a city to be one as much\nas possible, it does not seem to follow that this will take place by\npermitting all at once to say this is mine, and this is not mine (though\nthis is what Socrates regards as a proof that a city is entirely one),\nfor the word All is used in two senses; if it means each individual,\nwhat Socrates proposes will nearly take place; for each person will\nsay, this is his own son, and his own wife, and his own property, and\nof everything else that may happen to belong to him, that it is his own.\nBut those who have their wives and children in common will not say so,\nbut all will say so, though not as individuals; therefore, to use the\nword all is evidently a fallacious mode of speech; for this word is\nsometimes used distributively, and sometimes collectively, on account\nof its double meaning, and is the cause of inconclusive syllogisms in\nreasoning. Therefore for all persons to say the same thing was their\nown, using the word all in its distributive sense, would be well, but is\nimpossible: in its collective sense it would by no means contribute to\nthe concord of the state. Besides, there would be another inconvenience\nattending this proposal, for what is common to many is taken least care\nof; for all men regard more what is their own than what others share\nwith them in, to which they pay less attention than is incumbent on\nevery one: let me add also, that every one is more negligent of what\nanother is to see to, as well as himself, than of his own private\nbusiness; as in a family one is often worse served by many servants than\nby a few. Let each citizen then in the state have a thousand children,\nbut let none of them be considered as the children of that individual,\nbut let the relation of father and child be common to them all, and they\nwill all be neglected. Besides, in consequence of this, [1262a] whenever\nany citizen behaved well or ill, every person, be the number what it\nwould, might say, this is my son, or this man's or that; and in\nthis manner would they speak, and thus would they doubt of the whole\nthousand, or of whatever number the city consisted; and it would be\nuncertain to whom each child belonged, and when it was born, who was to\ntake care of it: and which do you think is better, for every one to say\nthis is mine, while they may apply it equally to two thousand or ten\nthousand; or as we say, this is mine in our present forms of government,\nwhere one man calls another his son, another calls that same person\nhis brother, another nephew, or some other relation, either by blood\nor marriage, and first extends his care to him and his, while another\nregards him as one of the same parish and the same tribe; and it is\nbetter for any one to be a nephew in his private capacity than a son\nafter that manner. Besides, it will be impossible to prevent some\npersons from suspecting that they are brothers and sisters, fathers and\nmothers to each other; for, from the mutual likeness there is between\nthe sire and the offspring, they will necessarily conclude in what\nrelation they stand to each other, which circumstance, we are informed\nby those writers who describe different parts of the world, does\nsometimes happen; for in Upper Africa there are wives in common who\nyet deliver their children to their respective fathers, being guided\nby their likeness to them. There are also some mares and cows which\nnaturally bring forth their young so like the male, that we can easily\ndistinguish by which of them they were impregnated: such was the mare\ncalled Just, in Pharsalia.\nCHAPTER IV\nBesides, those who contrive this plan of community cannot easily avoid\nthe following evils; namely, blows, murders involuntary or voluntary,\nquarrels, and reproaches, all which it would be impious indeed to be\nguilty of towards our fathers and mothers, or those who are nearly\nrelated to us; though not to those who are not connected to us by any\ntie of affinity: and certainly these mischiefs must necessarily happen\noftener amongst those who do not know how they are connected to each\nother than those who do; and when they do happen, if it is among the\nfirst of these, they admit of a legal expiation, but amongst the latter\nthat cannot be done. It is also absurd for those who promote a\ncommunity of children to forbid those who love each other from indulging\nthemselves in the last excesses of that passion, while they do not\nrestrain them from the passion itself, or those intercourses which are\nof all things most improper, between a Father and a son, a brother and\na brother, and indeed the thing itself is most absurd. It is also\nridiculous to prevent this intercourse between the nearest relations,\nfor no other reason than the violence of the pleasure, while they think\nthat the relation of father and daughter, the brother and sister, is of\nno consequence at all. It seems also more advantageous for the state,\nthat the husbandmen should have their wives and children in common than\nthe military, for there will be less affection [1262b] among them\nin that case than when otherwise; for such persons ought to be under\nsubjection, that they may obey the laws, and not seek after innovations.\nUpon the whole, the consequences of such a law as this would be directly\ncontrary to those things which good laws ought to establish, and which\nSocrates endeavoured to establish by his regulations concerning women\nand children: for we think that friendship is the greatest good which\ncan happen to any city, as nothing so much prevents seditions: and amity\nin a city is what Socrates commends above all things, which appears\nto be, as indeed he says, the effect of friendship; as we learn from\nAristophanes in the Erotics, who says, that those who love one another\nfrom the excess of that passion, desire to breathe the same soul, and\nfrom being two to be blended into one: from whence it would necessarily\nfollow, that both or one of them must be destroyed. But now in a city\nwhich admits of this community, the tie of friendship must, from that\nvery cause, be extremely weak, when no father can say, this is my son;\nor son, this is my father; for as a very little of what is sweet, being\nmixed with a great deal of water is imperceptible after the mixture, so\nmust all family connections, and the names they go by, be necessarily\ndisregarded in such a community, it being then by no means necessary\nthat the father should have any regard for him he called a son, or\nthe brothers for those they call brothers. There are two things which\nprincipally inspire mankind with care and love of their offspring,\nknowing it is their own, and what ought to be the object of their\naffection, neither of which can take place in this sort of community. As\nfor exchanging the children of the artificers and husbandmen with those\nof the military, and theirs reciprocally with these, it will occasion\ngreat confusion in whatever manner it shall be done; for of necessity,\nthose who carry the children must know from whom they took and to whom\nthey gave them; and by this means those evils which I have already\nmentioned will necessarily be the more likely to happen, as blows,\nincestuous love, murders, and the like; for those who are given from\ntheir own parents to other citizens, the military, for instance, will\nnot call them brothers, sons, fathers, or mothers. The same thing\nwould happen to those of the military who were placed among the other\ncitizens; so that by this means every one would be in fear how to act\nin consequence of consanguinity. And thus let us determine concerning a\ncommunity of wives and children.\nCHAPTER V\nWe proceed next to consider in what manner property should be regulated\nin a state which is formed after the most perfect mode of government,\nwhether it should be common or not; for this may be considered as a\nseparate question from what had been determined concerning [1263a] wives\nand children; I mean, whether it is better that these should be held\nseparate, as they now everywhere are, or that not only possessions but\nalso the usufruct of them should be in common; or that the soil should\nhave a particular owner, but that the produce should be brought together\nand used as one common stock, as some nations at present do; or on the\ncontrary, should the soil be common, and should it also be cultivated in\ncommon, while the produce is divided amongst the individuals for their\nparticular use, which is said to be practised by some barbarians; or\nshall both the soil and the fruit be common? When the business of\nthe husbandman devolves not on the citizen, the matter is much easier\nsettled; but when those labour together who have a common right of\npossession, this may occasion several difficulties; for there may not\nbe an equal proportion between their labour and what they consume; and\nthose who labour hard and have but a small proportion of the produce,\nwill certainly complain of those who take a large share of it and do but\nlittle for that. Upon the whole, as a community between man and man so\nentire as to include everything possible, and thus to have all things\nthat man can possess in common, is very difficult, so is it particularly\nso with respect to property; and this is evident from that community\nwhich takes place between those who go out to settle a colony; for they\nfrequently have disputes with each other upon the most common occasions,\nand come to blows upon trifles: we find, too, that we oftenest correct\nthose slaves who are generally employed in the common offices of the\nfamily: a community of property then has these and other inconveniences\nattending it.\nBut the manner of life which is now established, more particularly when\nembellished with good morals and a system of equal laws, is far superior\nto it, for it will have the advantage of both; by both I mean properties\nbeing common, and divided also; for in some respects it ought to be in\na manner common, but upon the whole private: for every man's attention\nbeing employed on his own particular concerns, will prevent mutual\ncomplaints against each other; nay, by this means industry will be\nincreased, as each person will labour to improve his own private\nproperty; and it will then be, that from a principle of virtue they will\nmutually perform good offices to each other, according to the proverb,\n\"All things are common amongst friends;\" and in some cities there are\ntraces of this custom to be seen, so that it is not impracticable, and\nparticularly in those which are best governed; some things are by this\nmeans in a manner common, and others might be so; for there, every\nperson enjoying his own private property, some things he assists his\nfriend with, others are considered as in common; as in Lacedaemon, where\nthey use each other's slaves, as if they were, so to speak, their own,\nas they do their horses and dogs, or even any provision they may want in\na journey.\nIt is evident then that it is best to have property private, but to make\nthe use of it common; but how the citizens are to be brought to it is\nthe particular [1263b] business of the legislator. And also with respect\nto pleasure, it is unspeakable how advantageous it is, that a man should\nthink he has something which he may call his own; for it is by no means\nto no purpose, that each person should have an affection for himself,\nfor that is natural, and yet to be a self-lover is justly censured; for\nwe mean by that, not one that simply loves himself, but one that loves\nhimself more than he ought; in like manner we blame a money-lover,\nand yet both money and self is what all men love. Besides, it is very\npleasing to us to oblige and assist our friends and companions, as well\nas those whom we are connected with by the rights of hospitality; and\nthis cannot be done without the establishment of private property, which\ncannot take place with those who make a city too much one; besides, they\nprevent every opportunity of exercising two principal virtues, modesty\nand liberality. Modesty with respect to the female sex, for this virtue\nrequires you to abstain from her who is another's; liberality, which\ndepends upon private property, for without that no one can appear\nliberal, or do any generous action; for liberality consists in imparting\nto others what is our own.\nThis system of polity does indeed recommend itself by its good\nappearance and specious pretences to humanity; and when first proposed\nto any one, must give him great pleasure, as he will conclude it to be\na wonderful bond of friendship, connecting all to all; particularly\nwhen any one censures the evils which are now to be found in society,\nas arising from properties not being common, I mean the disputes which\nhappen between man and man, upon their different contracts with each\nother; those judgments which are passed in court in consequence of\nfraud, and perjury, and flattering the rich, none of which arise from\nproperties being private, but from the vices of mankind. Besides,\nthose who live in one general community, and have all things in common,\noftener dispute with each other than those who have their property\nseparate; from the very small number indeed of those who have their\nproperty in common, compared with those where it is appropriated,\nthe instances of their quarrels are but few. It is also but right to\nmention, not only the inconveniences they are preserved from who live in\na communion of goods, but also the advantages they are deprived of; for\nwhen the whole comes to be considered, this manner of life will be found\nimpracticable.\nWe must suppose, then, that Socrates's mistake arose from the principle\nhe set out with being false; we admit, indeed, that both a family and a\ncity ought to be one in some particulars, but not entirely; for there\nis a point beyond which if a city proceeds in reducing itself to one, it\nwill be no longer a city.\nThere is also another point at which it will still continue to be a\ncity, but it will approach so near to not being one, that it will be\nworse than none; as if any one should reduce the voices of those who\nsing in concert to one, or a verse to a foot. But the people ought to\nbe made one, and a community, as I have already said, by education;\nas property at Lacedaemon, and their public tables at Crete, were made\ncommon by their legislators. But yet, whosoever shall introduce any\neducation, and think thereby to make his city excellent and respectable,\nwill be absurd, while he expects to form it by such regulations, and not\nby manners, philosophy, and laws. And whoever [1264a] would establish\na government upon a community of goods, ought to know that he should\nconsult the experience of many years, which would plainly enough inform\nhim whether such a scheme is useful; for almost all things have already\nbeen found out, but some have been neglected, and others which have been\nknown have not been put in practice. But this would be most evident, if\nany one could see such a government really established: for it would be\nimpossible to frame such a city without dividing and separating it into\nits distinct parts, as public tables, wards, and tribes; so that here\nthe laws will do nothing more than forbid the military to engage\nin agriculture, which is what the Lacedaemonians are at present\nendeavouring to do.\nNor has Socrates told us (nor is it easy to say) what plan of government\nshould be pursued with respect to the individuals in the state where\nthere is a community of goods established; for though the majority\nof his citizens will in general consist of a multitude of persons of\ndifferent occupations, of those he has determined nothing; whether the\nproperty of the husbandman ought to be in common, or whether each person\nshould have his share to himself; and also, whether their wives and\nchildren ought to be in common: for if all things are to be alike common\nto all, where will be the difference between them and the military, or\nwhat would they get by submitting to their government? and upon what\nprinciples would they do it, unless they should establish the wise\npractice of the Cretans? for they, allowing everything else to their\nslaves, forbid them only gymnastic exercises and the use of arms. And if\nthey are not, but these should be in the same situation with respect to\ntheir property which they are in other cities, what sort of a community\nwill there be? in one city there must of necessity be two, and those\ncontrary to each other; for he makes the military the guardians of the\nstate, and the husbandman, artisans, and others, citizens; and all those\nquarrels, accusations, and things of the like sort, which he says are\nthe bane of other cities, will be found in his also: notwithstanding\nSocrates says they will not want many laws in consequence of their\neducation, but such only as may be necessary for regulating the streets,\nthe markets, and the like, while at the same time it is the education of\nthe military only that he has taken any care of. Besides, he makes the\nhusbandmen masters of property upon paying a tribute; but this would\nbe likely to make them far more troublesome and high-spirited than the\nHelots, the Penestise, or the slaves which others employ; nor has he\never determined whether it is necessary to give any attention to them\nin these particulars, nor thought of what is connected therewith,\ntheir polity, their education, their laws; besides, it is of no little\nconsequence, nor is it easy to determine, how these should be framed so\nas to preserve the community of the military.\nBesides, if he makes the wives common, while the property [1264b]\ncontinues separate, who shall manage the domestic concerns with the same\ncare which the man bestows upon his fields? nor will the inconvenience\nbe remedied by making property as well as wives common; and it is absurd\nto draw a comparison from the brute creation, and say, that the same\nprinciple should regulate the connection of a man and a woman which\nregulates theirs amongst whom there is no family association.\nIt is also very hazardous to settle the magistracy as Socrates has\ndone; for he would have persons of the same rank always in office, which\nbecomes the cause of sedition even amongst those who are of no account,\nbut more particularly amongst those who are of a courageous and warlike\ndisposition; it is indeed evidently necessary that he should frame his\ncommunity in this manner; for that golden particle which God has mixed\nup in the soul of man flies not from one to the other, but always\ncontinues with the same; for he says, that some of our species have\ngold, and others silver, blended in their composition from the moment of\ntheir birth: but those who are to be husbandmen and artists, brass and\niron; besides, though he deprives the military of happiness, he says,\nthat the legislator ought to make all the citizens happy; but it\nis impossible that the whole city can be happy, without all, or the\ngreater, or some part of it be happy. For happiness is not like\nthat numerical equality which arises from certain numbers when added\ntogether, although neither of them may separately contain it; for\nhappiness cannot be thus added together, but must exist in every\nindividual, as some properties belong to every integral; and if the\nmilitary are not happy, who else are so? for the artisans are not, nor\nthe multitude of those who are employed in inferior offices. The state\nwhich Socrates has described has all these defects, and others which are\nnot of less consequence.\nCHAPTER VI\nIt is also nearly the same in the treatise upon Laws which was writ\nafterwards, for which reason it will be proper in this place to consider\nbriefly what he has there said upon government, for Socrates has\nthoroughly settled but very few parts of it; as for instance, in what\nmanner the community of wives and children ought to be regulated, how\nproperty should be established, and government conducted.\nNow he divides the inhabitants into two parts, husbandmen and soldiers,\nand from these he select a third part who are to be senators and govern\nthe city; but he has not said whether or no the husbandman and artificer\nshall have any or what share in the government, or whether they shall\nhave arms, and join with the others in war, or not. He thinks also\nthat the women ought to go to war, and have the same education as the\nsoldiers; as to other particulars, he has filled his treatise with\nmatter foreign to the purpose; and with respect to education, he has\nonly said what that of the guards ought to be.\n[1265a] As to his book of Laws, laws are the principal thing which that\ncontains, for he has there said but little concerning government; and\nthis government, which he was so desirous of framing in such a manner as\nto impart to its members a more entire community of goods than is to be\nfound in other cities, he almost brings round again to be the same\nas that other government which he had first proposed; for except the\ncommunity of wives and goods, he has framed both his governments alike,\nfor the education of the citizens is to be the same in both; they are in\nboth to live without any servile employ, and their common tables are to\nbe the same, excepting that in that he says the women should have common\ntables, and that there should be a thousand men-at-arms, in this, that\nthere should be five thousand.\nAll the discourses of Socrates are masterly, noble, new, and\ninquisitive; but that they are all true it may probably be too much\nto say. For now with respect to the number just spoken of, it must be\nacknowledged that he would want the country of Babylonia for them, or\nsome one like it, of an immeasurable extent, to support five thousand\nidle persons, besides a much greater number of women and servants. Every\none, it is true, may frame an hypothesis as he pleases, but yet it ought\nto be possible. It has been said, that a legislator should have two\nthings in view when he frames his laws, the country and the people. He\nwill also do well, if he has some regard to the neighbouring states, if\nhe intends that his community should maintain any political intercourse\nwith them, for it is not only necessary that they should understand that\npractice of war which is adapted to their own country, but to others\nalso; for admitting that any one chooses not this life either in\npublic or private, yet there is not the less occasion for their being\nformidable to their enemies, not only when they invade their country,\nbut also when they retire out of it.\nIt may also be considered whether the quantity of each person's property\nmay not be settled in a different manner from what he has done it in,\nby making it more determinate; for he says, that every one ought to have\nenough whereon to live moderately, as if any one had said to live well,\nwhich is the most comprehensive expression. Besides, a man may live\nmoderately and miserably at the same time; he had therefore better\nhave proposed, that they should live both moderately and liberally;\nfor unless these two conspire, luxury will come in on the one hand, or\nwretchedness on the other, since these two modes of living are the only\nones applicable to the employment of our substance; for we cannot say\nwith respect to a man's fortune, that he is mild or courageous, but we\nmay say that he is prudent and liberal, which are the only qualities\nconnected therewith.\nIt is also absurd to render property equal, and not to provide for\nthe increasing number of the citizens; but to leave that circumstance\nuncertain, as if it would regulate itself according to the number of\nwomen who [1265b] should happen to be childless, let that be what it\nwould because this seems to take place in other cities; but the case\nwould not be the same in such a state which he proposes and those which\nnow actually unite; for in these no one actually wants, as the property\nis divided amongst the whole community, be their numbers what they will;\nbut as it could not then be divided, the supernumeraries, whether they\nwere many or few, would have nothing at all. But it is more necessary\nthan even to regulate property, to take care that the increase of the\npeople should not exceed a certain number; and in determining that,\nto take into consideration those children who will die, and also those\nwomen who will be barren; and to neglect this, as is done in several\ncities, is to bring certain poverty on the citizens; and poverty is the\ncause of sedition and evil. Now Phidon the Corinthian, one of the oldest\nlegislators, thought the families and the number of the citizens should\ncontinue the same; although it should happen that all should have\nallotments at the first, disproportionate to their numbers.\nIn Plato's Laws it is however different; we shall mention hereafter what\nwe think would be best in these particulars. He has also neglected in\nthat treatise to point out how the governors are to be distinguished\nfrom the governed; for he says, that as of one sort of wool the warp\nought to be made, and of another the woof, so ought some to govern, and\nothers to be governed. But since he admits, that all their property may\nbe increased fivefold, why should he not allow the same increase to the\ncountry? he ought also to consider whether his allotment of the houses\nwill be useful to the community, for he appoints two houses to each\nperson, separate from each other; but it is inconvenient for a person\nto inhabit two houses. Now he is desirous to have his whole plan of\ngovernment neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but something between\nboth, which he calls a polity, for it is to be composed of men-at-arms.\nIf Plato intended to frame a state in which more than in any other\neverything should be common, he has certainly given it a right name;\nbut if he intended it to be the next in perfection to that which he had\nalready framed, it is not so; for perhaps some persons will give the\npreference to the Lacedaemonian form of government, or some other which\nmay more completely have attained to the aristocratic form.\nSome persons say, that the most perfect government should be composed\nof all others blended together, for which reason they commend that\nof Lacedaemon; for they say, that this is composed of an oligarchy,\na monarchy, and a democracy, their kings representing the monarchical\npart, the senate the oligarchical; and, that in the ephori may be found\nthe democratical, as these are taken from the people. But some say, that\nin the ephori is absolute power, and that it is their common meal and\ndaily course of life, in which the democratical form is represented.\nIt is also said in this treatise of [1266a] Laws, that the best form of\ngovernment must, be one composed of a democracy and a tyranny; though\nsuch a mixture no one else would ever allow to be any government at all,\nor if it is, the worst possible; those propose what is much better who\nblend many governments together; for the most perfect is that which is\nformed of many parts. But now in this government of Plato's there are\nno traces of a monarchy, only of an oligarchy and democracy; though he\nseems to choose that it should rather incline to an oligarchy, as is\nevident from the appointment of the magistrates; for to choose them by\nlot is common to both; but that a man of fortune must necessarily be a\nmember of the assembly, or to elect the magistrates, or take part in the\nmanagement of public affairs, while others are passed over, makes the\nstate incline to an oligarchy; as does the endeavouring that the\ngreater part of the rich may be in office, and that the rank of their\nappointments may correspond with their fortunes.\nThe same principle prevails also in the choice of their senate; the\nmanner of electing which is favourable also to an oligarchy; for all\nare obliged to vote for those who are senators of the first class,\nafterwards they vote for the same number out of the second, and then out\nof the third; but this compulsion to vote at the election of senators\ndoes not extend to the third and fourth classes and the first and second\nclass only are obliged to vote for the fourth. By this means he says\nhe shall necessarily have an equal number of each rank, but he is\nmistaken--for the majority will always consist of those of the first\nrank, and the most considerable people; and for this reason, that\nmany of the commonalty not being obliged to it, will not attend the\nelections. From hence it is evident, that such a state will not consist\nof a democracy and a monarchy, and this will be further proved by\nwhat we shall say when we come particularly to consider this form of\ngovernment.\nThere will also great danger arise from the manner of electing the\nsenate, when those who are elected themselves are afterwards to elect\nothers; for by this means, if a certain number choose to combine\ntogether, though not very considerable, the election will always fall\naccording to their pleasure. Such are the things which Plato proposes\nconcerning government in his book of Laws.\nCHAPTER VII\nThere are also some other forms of government, which have been proposed\neither by private persons, or philosophers, or politicians, all of which\ncome much nearer to those which have been really established, or now\nexist, than these two of Plato's; for neither have they introduced the\ninnovation of a community of wives and children, and public tables for\nthe women, but have been contented to set out with establishing such\nrules as are absolutely necessary.\nThere are some persons who think, that the first object of government\nshould be to regulate well everything relating to private property;\nfor they say, that a neglect herein is the source of all seditions\nwhatsoever. For this reason, Phaleas the Chalcedonian first proposed,\nthat the fortunes of the citizens should be equal, which he thought was\nnot difficult to accomplish when a community was first settled, but\nthat it was a work of greater difficulty in one that had been long\nestablished; but yet that it might be effected, and an equality of\ncircumstances introduced by these means, that the rich should give\nmarriage portions, but never receive any, while the poor should always\nreceive, but never give.\nBut Plato, in his treatise of Laws, thinks that a difference in\ncircumstances should be permitted to a certain degree; but that no\ncitizen should be allowed to possess more than five times as much as the\nlowest census, as we have already mentioned. But legislators who\nwould establish this principle are apt to overlook what they ought to\nconsider; that while they regulate the quantity of provisions which each\nindividual shall possess, they ought also to regulate the number of his\nchildren; for if these exceed the allotted quantity of provision, the\nlaw must necessarily be repealed; and yet, in spite of the repeal, it\nwill have the bad effect of reducing many from wealth to poverty, so\ndifficult is it for innovators not to fall into such mistakes. That an\nequality of goods was in some degree serviceable to strengthen the bands\nof society, seems to have been known to some of the ancients; for Solon\nmade a law, as did some others also, to restrain persons from possessing\nas much land as they pleased. And upon the same principle there are laws\nwhich forbid men to sell their property, as among the Locrians, unless\nthey can prove that some notorious misfortune has befallen them. They\nwere also to preserve their ancient patrimony, which custom being broken\nthrough by the Leucadians, made their government too democratic; for\nby that means it was no longer necessary to be possessed of a certain\nfortune to be qualified to be a magistrate. But if an equality of goods\nis established, this may be either too much, when it enables the people\nto live luxuriously, or too little, when it obliges them to live\nhard. Hence it is evident, that it is not proper for the legislator\nto establish an equality of circumstances, but to fix a proper medium.\nBesides, if any one should regulate the division of property in such a\nmanner that there should be a moderate sufficiency for all, it would\nbe of no use; for it is of more consequence that the citizen should\nentertain a similarity of sentiments than an equality of circumstances;\nbut this can never be attained unless they are properly educated under\nthe direction of the law. But probably Phaleas may say, that this in\nwhat he himself mentions; for he both proposes a equality of property\nand one plan of education in his city. But he should have said\nparticularly what education he intended, nor is it of any service to\nhave this to much one; for this education may be one, and yet such as\nwill make the citizens over-greedy, to grasp after honours, or riches,\nor both. Besides, not only an inequality of possessions, but also\nof honours, will occasion [1267a] seditions, but this upon contrary\ngrounds; for the vulgar will be seditious if there be an inequality of\ngoods, by those of more elevated sentiments, if there is an equality of\nhonours.\n\"When good and bad do equal honours share.\"\nFor men are not guilty of crimes for necessaries only (for which he\nthinks an equality of goods would be a sufficient remedy, as they would\nthen have no occasion to steal cold or hunger), but that they may enjoy\nwhat they desire, and not wish for it in vain; for if their desire extend\nbeyond the common necessaries of life, they were be wicked to gratify\nthem; and not only so, but if their wishes point that way, they will do\nthe same to enjoy those pleasures which are free from the alloy of pain.\nWhat remedy then shall we find for these three disorders? And first,\nto prevent stealing from necessity, let every one be supplied with a\nmoderate subsistence, which may make the addition of his own industry\nnecessary; second to prevent stealing to procure the luxuries of life,\ntemperance be enjoined; and thirdly, let those who wish for pleasure in\nitself seek for it only in philosophy, all others want the assistance of\nmen.\nSince then men are guilty of the greatest crimes from ambition, and not\nfrom necessity, no one, for instance aims at being a tyrant to keep him\nfrom the cold, hence great honour is due to him who kills not a thief,\nbut tyrant; so that polity which Phaleas establishes would only be\nsalutary to prevent little crimes. He has also been very desirous to\nestablish such rules as will conduce to perfect the internal policy of\nhis state, and he ought also to have done the same with respect to\nits neighbours and all foreign nations; for the considerations of the\nmilitary establishment should take place in planning every government,\nthat it may not be unprovided in case of a war, of which he has said\nnothing; so also with respect to property, it ought not only to be\nadapted to the exigencies of the state, but also to such dangers as may\narise from without.\nThus it should not be so much as to tempt those who are near, and more\npowerful to invade it, while those who possess it are not able to drive\nout the invaders, nor so little as that the state should not be able to\ngo to war with those who are quite equal to itself, and of this he has\ndetermined nothing; it must indeed be allowed that it is advantageous to\na community to be rather rich than poor; probably the proper boundary is\nthis, not to possess enough to make it worth while for a more powerful\nneighbour to attack you, any more than he would those who had not so\nmuch as yourself; thus when Autophradatus proposed to besiege Atarneus,\nEubulus advised him to consider what time it would require to take the\ncity, and then would have him determine whether it would answer, for\nthat he should choose, if it would even take less than he proposed,\nto quit the place; his saying this made Autophradatus reflect upon the\nbusiness and give over the siege. There is, indeed, some advantage in an\nequality of goods amongst the citizens to prevent seditions; and yet,\nto say truth, no very great one; for men of great abilities will stomach\ntheir being put upon a level with the rest of the community. For\nwhich reason they will very often appear ready for every commotion and\nsedition; for the wickedness of mankind is insatiable. For though\nat first two oboli might be sufficient, yet when once it is become\ncustomary, they continually want something more, until they set no\nlimits to their expectations; for it is the nature of our desires to be\nboundless, and many live only to gratify them. But for this purpose the\nfirst object is, not so much to establish an equality of fortune, as\nto prevent those who are of a good disposition from desiring more than\ntheir own, and those who are of a bad one from being able to acquire it;\nand this may be done if they are kept in an inferior station, and not\nexposed to injustice. Nor has he treated well the equality of goods, for\nhe has extended his regulation only to land; whereas a man's substance\nconsists not only in this, but also in slaves, cattle, money, and all\nthat variety of things which fall under the name of chattels; now there\nmust be either an equality established in all these, or some certain\nrule, or they must be left entirely at large. It appears too by his\nlaws, that he intends to establish only a small state, as all the\nartificers are to belong to the public, and add nothing to the\ncomplement of citizens; but if all those who are to be employed in\npublic works are to be the slaves of the public, it should be done\nin the same manner as it is at Epidamnum, and as Diophantus formerly\nregulated it at Athens. From these particulars any one may nearly judge\nwhether Phaleas's community is well or ill established.\nCHAPTER VIII\nHippodamus, the son of Euruphon a Milesian, contrived the art of laying\nout towns, and separated the Pireus. This man was in other respects\ntoo eager after notice, and seemed to many to live in a very affected\nmanner, with his flowing locks and his expensive ornaments, and a coarse\nwarm vest which he wore, not only in the winter, but also in the\nhot weather. As he was very desirous of the character of a universal\nscholar, he was the first who, not being actually engaged in the\nmanagement of public affairs, sat himself to inquire what sort of\ngovernment was best; and he planned a state, consisting of ten thousand\npersons, divided into three parts, one consisting of artisans, another\nof husbandmen, and the third of soldiers; he also divided the lands into\nthree parts, and allotted one to sacred purposes, another to the public,\nand the third to individuals. The first of these was to supply what was\nnecessary for the established worship of the gods; the second was to\nbe allotted to the support of the soldiery; and the third was to be\nthe property of the husbandman. He thought also that there need only be\nthree sorts of laws, corresponding to the three sorts of actions which\ncan be brought, namely, for assault, trespasses, or death. He ordered\nalso that there should be a particular court of appeal, into which\nall causes might be removed which were supposed to have been unjustly\ndetermined elsewhere; which court should be composed of old men chosen\nfor that purpose. He thought also [1268a] that they should not pass\nsentence by votes; but that every one should bring with him a tablet, on\nwhich he should write, that he found the party guilty, if it was so, but\nif not, he should bring a plain tablet; but if he acquitted him of one\npart of the indictment but not of the other, he should express that\nalso on the tablet; for he disapproved of that general custom already\nestablished, as it obliges the judges to be guilty of perjury if they\ndetermined positively either on the one side or the other. He also made\na law, that those should be rewarded who found out anything for the good\nof the city, and that the children of those who fell in battle should be\neducated at the public expense; which law had never been proposed by any\nother legislator, though it is at present in use at Athens as well as in\nother cities, he would have the magistrates chosen out of the people\nin general, by whom he meant the three parts before spoken of; and that\nthose who were so elected should be the particular guardians of what\nbelonged to the public, to strangers, and to orphans.\nThese are the principal parts and most worthy of notice in Hippodamus's\nplan. But some persons might doubt the propriety of his division of the\ncitizens into three parts; for the artisans, the husbandmen, and the\nsoldiers are to compose one community, where the husbandmen are to have\nno arms, and the artisans neither arms nor land, which would in a manner\nrender them slaves to the soldiery. It is also impossible that the whole\ncommunity should partake of all the honourable employments in it--for\nthe generals and the guardians of the state must necessarily be\nappointed out of the soldiery, and indeed the most honourable\nmagistrates; but as the two other parts will not have their share in the\ngovernment, how can they be expected to have any affection for it? But\nit is necessary that the soldiery should be superior to the other two\nparts, and this superiority will not be easily gained without they are\nvery numerous; and if they are so, why should the community consist\nof any other members? why should any others have a right to elect the\nmagistrates? Besides, of what use are the husbandmen to this community?\nArtisans, 'tis true, are necessary, for these every city wants, and they\ncan live upon their business. If the husbandmen indeed furnished the\nsoldiers with provisions, they would be properly part of the community;\nbut these are supposed to have their private property, and to cultivate\nit for their own use. Moreover, if the soldiers themselves are to\ncultivate that common land which is appropriated for their support,\nthere will be no distinction between the soldier and the husbandman,\nwhich the legislator intended there should be; and if there should be\nany others who are to cultivate the private property of the husbandman\nand the common lands of the military, there will be a fourth order in\nthe state which will have no share in it, and always entertain hostile\nsentiments towards it. If any one should propose that the same persons\nshould cultivate their own lands and the public ones also, then there\nwould be a deficiency [1268b] of provisions to supply two families,\nas the lands would not immediately yield enough for themselves and the\nsoldiers also; and all these things would occasion great confusion.\nNor do I approve of his method of determining causes, when he would\nhave the judge split the case which comes simply before him; and thus,\ninstead of being a judge, become an arbitrator. Now when any matter\nis brought to arbitration, it is customary for many persons to confer\ntogether upon the business that is before them; but when a cause is\nbrought before judges it is not so; and many legislators take care\nthat the judges shall not have it in their power to communicate their\nsentiments to each other. Besides, what can prevent confusion on the\nbench when one judge thinks a fine should be different from what another\nhas set it at; one proposing twenty minae, another ten, or be it more\nor less, another four, and another five; and it is evident, that in this\nmanner they will differ from each other, while some will give the whole\ndamages sued for, and others nothing; in this situation, how shall their\ndeterminations be settled? Besides, a judge cannot be obliged to perjure\nhimself who simply acquits or condemns, if the action is fairly and\njustly brought; for he who acquits the party does not say that he ought\nnot to pay any fine at all, but that he ought not to pay a fine of\ntwenty minae. But he that condemns him is guilty of perjury if he\nsentences him to pay twenty minae while he believes the damages ought\nnot to be so much.\nNow with respect to these honours which he proposes to bestow on those\nwho can give any information useful to the community, this, though very\npleasing in speculation, is what the legislator should not settle, for\nit would encourage informers, and probably occasion commotions in the\nstate. And this proposal of his gives rise also to further conjectures\nand inquiries; for some persons have doubted whether it is useful or\nhurtful to alter the established law of any country, if even for the\nbetter; for which reason one cannot immediately determine upon what he\nhere says, whether it is advantageous to alter the law or not. We know,\nindeed, that it is possible to propose to new model both the laws and\ngovernment as a common good; and since we have mentioned this subject,\nit may be very proper to enter into a few particulars concerning it, for\nit contains some difficulties, as I have already said, and it may appear\nbetter to alter them, since it has been found useful in other sciences.\nThus the science of physic is extended beyond its ancient bounds; so is\nthe gymnastic, and indeed all other arts and powers; so that one may lay\nit down for certain that the same thing will necessarily hold good in\nthe art of government. And it may also be affirmed, that experience\nitself gives a proof of this; for the ancient laws are too simple and\nbarbarous; which allowed the Greeks to wear swords in the city, and to\nbuy their wives of each [1269a]. other. And indeed all the remains of\nold laws which we have are very simple; for instance, a law in Cuma\nrelative to murder. If any person who prosecutes another for murder can\nproduce a certain number of witnesses to it of his own relations, the\naccused person shall be held guilty. Upon the whole, all persons ought\nto endeavour to follow what is right, and not what is established; and\nit is probable that the first men, whether they sprung out of the earth,\nor were saved from some general calamity, had very little understanding\nor knowledge, as is affirmed of these aborigines; so that it would be\nabsurd to continue in the practice of their rules. Nor is it, moreover,\nright to permit written laws always to remain without alteration; for\nas in all other sciences, so in politics, it is impossible to express\neverything in writing with perfect exactness; for when we commit\nanything to writing we must use general terms, but in every action there\nis something particular to itself, which these may not comprehend; from\nwhence it is evident, that certain laws will at certain times admit of\nalterations. But if we consider this matter in another point of view, it\nwill appear to require great caution; for when the advantage proposed is\ntrifling, as the accustoming the people easily to abolish their laws\nis of bad consequence, it is evidently better to pass over some faults\nwhich either the legislator or the magistrates may have committed; for\nthe alterations will not be of so much service as a habit of disobeying\nthe magistrates will be of disservice. Besides, the instance brought\nfrom the arts is fallacious; for it is not the same thing to alter the\none as the other. For a law derives all its strength from custom, and\nthis requires long time to establish; so that, to make it an easy matter\nto pass from the established laws to other new ones, is to weaken the\npower of laws. Besides, here is another question; if the laws are to be\naltered, are they all to be altered, and in every government or not, and\nwhether at the pleasure of one person or many? all which particulars\nwill make a great difference; for which reason we will at present drop\nthe inquiry, to pursue it at some other time.\nCHAPTER IX\nThere are two considerations which offer themselves with respect to the\ngovernment established at Lacedaemon and Crete, and indeed in almost all\nother states whatsoever; one is whether their laws do or do not promote\nthe best establishment possible? the other is whether there is anything,\nif we consider either the principles upon which it is founded or the\nexecutive part of it, which prevents the form of government that they\nhad proposed to follow from being observed; now it is allowed that in\nevery well-regulated state the members of it should be free from servile\nlabour; but in what manner this shall be effected is not so easy to\ndetermine; for the Penestse have very often attacked the Thessalians,\nand the Helots the Lacedaemonians, for they in a manner continually\nwatch an opportunity for some misfortune befalling them. But no such\nthing has ever happened to the Cretans; the [1269b] reason for which\nprobably is, that although they are engaged in frequent wars with the\nneighbouring cities, yet none of these would enter into an alliance with\nthe revolters, as it would be disadvantageous for them, who themselves\nalso have their villains. But now there is perpetual enmity between the\nLacedaemonians and all their neighbours, the Argives, the Messenians,\nand the Arcadians. Their slaves also first revolted from the Thessalians\nwhile they were engaged in wars with their neighbours the Acheans, the\nPerrabeans, and the Magnesians. It seems to me indeed, if nothing else,\nyet something very troublesome to keep upon proper terms with them;\nfor if you are remiss in your discipline they grow insolent, and think\nthemselves upon an equality with their masters; and if they are hardly\nused they are continually plotting against you and hate you. It is\nevident, then, that those who employ slaves have not as yet hit upon the\nright way of managing them.\nAs to the indulging of women in any particular liberties, it is hurtful\nto the end of government and the prosperity of the city; for as a man\nand his wife are the two parts of a family, if we suppose a city to be\ndivided into two parts, we must allow that the number of men and women\nwill be equal.\nIn whatever city then the women are not under good regulations, we must\nlook upon one half of it as not under the restraint of law, as it\nthere happened; for the legislator, desiring to make his whole city\na collection of warriors with respect to the men, he most evidently\naccomplished his design; but in the meantime the women were quite\nneglected, for they live without restraint in every improper indulgence\nand luxury. So that in such a state riches will necessarily be in\ngeneral esteem, particularly if the men are governed by their wives,\nwhich has been the case with many a brave and warlike people except\nthe Celts, and those other nations, if there are any such, who openly\npractise pederasty. And the first mythologists seem not improperly to\nhave joined Mars and Venus together; for all nations of this character\nare greatly addicted either to the love of women or of boys, for which\nreason it was thus at Lacedaemon; and many things in their state were\ndone by the authority of the women. For what is the difference, if the\npower is in the hands of the women, or in the hands of those whom they\nthemselves govern? it must turn to the same account. As this boldness of\nthe women can be of no use in any common occurrences, if it was ever so,\nit must be in war; but even here we find that the Lacedaemonian women\nwere of the greatest disservice, as was proved at the time of the Theban\ninvasion, when they were of no use at all, as they are in other cities,\nbut made more disturbance than even the enemy.\nThe origin of this indulgence which the Lacedaemonian women enjoy is\neasily accounted for, from the long time the men were absent from home\nupon foreign expeditions [1270a] against the Argives, and afterwards the\nArcadians and Messenians, so that, when these wars were at an end, their\nmilitary life, in which there is no little virtue, prepared them to obey\nthe precepts of their law-giver; but we are told, that when Lycurgus\nendeavoured also to reduce the women to an obedience to his laws, upon\ntheir refusal he declined it. It may indeed be said that the women were\nthe causes of these things, and of course all the fault was theirs. But\nwe are not now considering where the fault lies, or where it does not\nlie, but what is right and what is wrong; and when the manners of the\nwomen are not well regulated, as I have already said, it must not only\noccasion faults which are disgraceful to the state, but also increase\nthe love of money. In the next place, fault may be found with his\nunequal division of property, for some will have far too much, others\ntoo little; by which means the land will come into few hands, which\nbusiness is badly regulated by his laws. For he made it infamous for any\none either to buy or sell their possessions, in which he did right; but\nhe permitted any one that chose it to give them away, or bequeath them,\nalthough nearly the same consequences will arise from one practice as\nfrom the other. It is supposed that near two parts in five of the whole\ncountry is the property of women, owing to their being so often sole\nheirs, and having such large fortunes in marriage; though it would\nbe better to allow them none, or a little, or a certain regulated\nproportion. Now every one is permitted to make a woman his heir if he\npleases; and if he dies intestate, he who succeeds as heir at law gives\nit to whom he pleases. From whence it happens that although the country\nis able to support fifteen hundred horse and thirty thousand foot, the\nnumber does not amount to one thousand.\nAnd from these facts it is evident, that this particular is badly\nregulated; for the city could not support one shock, but was ruined for\nwant of men. They say, that during the reigns of their ancient kings\nthey used to present foreigners with the freedom of their city, to\nprevent there being a want of men while they carried on long wars; it is\nalso affirmed that the number of Spartans was formerly ten thousand; but\nbe that as it will, an equality of property conduces much to increase\nthe number of the people. The law, too, which he made to encourage\npopulation was by no means calculated to correct this inequality;\nfor being willing that the Spartans should be as numerous as [1270b]\npossible, to make them desirous of having large families he ordered that\nhe who had three children should be excused the night-watch, and that he\nwho had four should pay no taxes: though it is very evident, that while\nthe land was divided in this manner, that if the people increased there\nmust many of them be very poor.\nNor was he less blamable for the manner in which he constituted the\nephori; for these magistrates take cognisance of things of the last\nimportance, and yet they are chosen out of the people in general; so\nthat it often happens that a very poor person is elected to that office,\nwho, from that circumstance, is easily bought. There have been many\ninstances of this formerly, as well as in the late affair at Andros. And\nthese men, being corrupted with money, went as far as they could to ruin\nthe city: and, because their power was too great and nearly tyrannical,\ntheir kings were obliged to natter them, which contributed greatly to\nhurt the state; so that it altered from an aristocracy to a democracy.\nThis magistracy is indeed the great support of the state; for the people\nare easy, knowing that they are eligible to the first office in it;\nso that, whether it took place by the intention of the legislator,\nor whether it happened by chance, this is of great service to their\naffairs; for it is necessary that every member of the state should\nendeavour that each part of the government should be preserved, and\ncontinue the same. And upon this principle their kings have always\nacted, out of regard to their honour; the wise and good from their\nattachment to the senate, a seat wherein they consider as the reward of\nvirtue; and the common people, that they may support the ephori, of whom\nthey consist. And it is proper that these magistrates should be chosen\nout of the whole community, not as the custom is at present, which is\nvery ridiculous. The ephori are the supreme judges in causes of the last\nconsequence; but as it is quite accidental what sort of persons they may\nbe, it is not right that they should determine according to their own\nopinion, but by a written law or established custom. Their way of life\nalso is not consistent with the manners of the city, for it is too\nindulgent; whereas that of others is too severe; so that they cannot\nsupport it, but are obliged privately to act contrary to law, that they\nmay enjoy some of the pleasures of sense. There are also great defects\nin the institution of their senators. If indeed they were fitly trained\nto the practice of every human virtue, every one would readily admit\nthat they would be useful to the government; but still it might be\ndebated whether they should be continued judges for life, to determine\npoints of the greatest moment, since the mind has its old age as well\nas the body; but as they are so brought up, [1271a] that even the\nlegislator could not depend upon them as good men, their power must\nbe inconsistent with the safety of the state: for it is known that the\nmembers of that body have been guilty both of bribery and partiality in\nmany public affairs; for which reason it had been much better if they\nhad been made answerable for their conduct, which they are not. But it\nmay be said the ephori seem to have a check upon all the magistrates.\nThey have indeed in this particular very great power; but I affirm that\nthey should not be entrusted with this control in the manner they are.\nMoreover, the mode of choice which they make use of at the election of\ntheir senators is very childish. Nor is it right for any one to solicit\nfor a place he is desirous of; for every person, whether he chooses it\nor not, ought to execute any office he is fit for. But his intention was\nevidently the same in this as in the other parts of his government.\nFor making his citizens ambitious after honours, with men of that\ndisposition he has filled his senate, since no others will solicit for\nthat office; and yet the principal part of those crimes which men are\ndeliberately guilty of arise from ambition and avarice.\nWe will inquire at another time whether the office of a king is useful\nto the state: thus much is certain, that they should be chosen from a\nconsideration of their conduct and not as they are now. But that the\nlegislator himself did not expect to make all his citizens honourable\nand completely virtuous is evident from this, that he distrusts them as\nnot being good men; for he sent those upon the same embassy that were at\nvariance with each other; and thought, that in the dispute of the kings\nthe safety of the state consisted. Neither were their common meals at\nfirst well established: for these should rather have been provided at\nthe public expense, as at Crete, where, as at Lacedaemon, every one was\nobliged to buy his portion, although he might be very poor, and could by\nno means bear the expense, by which means the contrary happened to what\nthe legislator desired: for he intended that those public meals should\nstrengthen the democratic part of his government: but this regulation\nhad quite the contrary effect, for those who were very poor could not\ntake part in them; and it was an observation of their forefathers, that\nthe not allowing those who could not contribute their proportion to the\ncommon tables to partake of them, would be the ruin of the state. Other\npersons have censured his laws concerning naval affairs, and not without\nreason, as it gave rise to disputes. For the commander of the fleet is\nin a manner set up in opposition to the kings, who are generals of the\narmy for life.\n[1271b] There is also another defect in his laws worthy of censure,\nwhich Plato has given in his book of Laws; that the whole constitution\nwas calculated only for the business of war: it is indeed excellent to\nmake them conquerors; for which reason the preservation of the state\ndepended thereon. The destruction of it commenced with their victories:\nfor they knew not how to be idle, or engage in any other employment\nthan war. In this particular also they were mistaken, that though they\nrightly thought, that those things which are the objects of contention\namongst mankind are better procured by virtue than vice, yet they\nwrongfully preferred the things themselves to virtue. Nor was the public\nrevenue well managed at Sparta, for the state was worth nothing while\nthey were obliged to carry on the most extensive wars, and the subsidies\nwere very badly raised; for as the Spartans possessed a large extent of\ncountry, they were not exact upon each other as to what they paid in.\nAnd thus an event contrary to the legislator's intention took place;\nfor the state was poor, the individuals avaricious. Enough of the\nLacedaemonian government; for these seem the chief defects in it.\nCHAPTER X\nThe government of Crete bears a near resemblance to this, in some few\nparticulars it is not worse, but in general it is far inferior in its\ncontrivance. For it appears and is allowed in many particulars the\nconstitution of Lacedaemon was formed in imitation of that of Crete;\nand in general most new things are an improvement upon the old. For they\nsay, that when Lycurgus ceased to be guardian to King Charilles he\nwent abroad and spent a long time with his relations in Crete, for the\nLycians are a colony of the Lacedaemonians; and those who first settled\nthere adopted that body of laws which they found already established by\nthe inhabitants; in like manner also those who now live near them have\nthe very laws which Minos first drew up.\nThis island seems formed by nature to be the mistress of Greece, for it\nis entirely surrounded by a navigable ocean which washes almost all the\nmaritime parts of that country, and is not far distant on the one side\nfrom Peloponnesus, on the other, which looks towards Asia, from Triopium\nand Rhodes. By means of this situation Minos acquired the empire of\nthe sea and the islands; some of which he subdued, in others planted\ncolonies: at last he died at Camicus while he was attacking Sicily.\nThere is this analogy between the customs of the Lacedaemonians and\nthe Cretans, the Helots cultivate the grounds [1272a] for the one, the\ndomestic slaves for the other. Both states have their common meals, and\nthe Lacedaemonians called these formerly not _psiditia_ but _andpia_,\nas the Cretans do; which proves from whence the custom arose. In this\nparticular their governments are also alike: the ephori have the same\npower with those of Crete, who are called _kosmoi_; with this difference\nonly, that the number of the one is five, of the other ten. The senators\nare the same as those whom the Cretans call the council. There was\nformerly also a kingly power in Crete; but it was afterwards dissolved,\nand the command of their armies was given to the _kosmoi_. Every one\nalso has a vote in their public assembly; but this has only the power of\nconfirming what has already passed the council and the _kosmoi_.\nThe Cretans conducted their public meals better than the Lacedaemonians,\nfor at Lacedaemon each individual was obliged to furnish what was\nassessed upon him; which if he could not do, there was a law which\ndeprived him of the rights of a citizen, as has been already mentioned:\nbut in Crete they were furnished by the community; for all the corn and\ncattle, taxes and contributions, which the domestic slaves were obliged\nto furnish, were divided into parts and allotted to the gods, the\nexigencies of the state, and these public meals; so that all the men,\nwomen, and children were maintained from a common stock. The legislator\ngave great attention to encourage a habit of eating sparingly, as very\nuseful to the citizens. He also endeavoured, that his community might\nnot be too populous, to lessen the connection with women, by introducing\nthe love of boys: whether in this he did well or ill we shall have some\nother opportunity of considering. But that the public meals were better\nordered at Crete than at Lacedaemon is very evident.\nThe institution of the _kosmoi_, was still worse than that of the\nephori: for it contained all the faults incident to that magistracy and\nsome peculiar to itself; for in both cases it is uncertain who will be\nelected: but the Lacedaemonians have this advantage which the others\nhave not, that as all are eligible, the whole community have a share\nin the highest honours, and therefore all desire to preserve the state:\nwhereas among the Cretans the _kosmoi_ are not chosen out of the people\nin general, but out of some certain families, and the senate out of the\n_kosmoi_. And the same observations which may be made on the senate at\nLacedaemon may be applied to these; for their being under no control,\nand their continuing for life, is an honour greater than they merit; and\nto have their proceedings not regulated by a written law, but left to\ntheir own discretion, is dangerous. (As to there being no insurrections,\nalthough the people share not in the management of public affairs, this\nis no proof of a well-constituted government, as the _kosmoi_ have no\nopportunity of being bribed like the ephori, as they live in an [1272b]\nisland far from those who would corrupt them.) But the method they take\nto correct that fault is absurd, impolitic, and tyrannical: for very\noften either their fellow-magistrates or some private persons conspire\ntogether and turn out the _kosmoi_. They are also permitted to resign\ntheir office before their time is elapsed, and if all this was done by\nlaw it would be well, and not at the pleasure of the individuals, which\nis a bad rule to follow. But what is worst of all is, that general\nconfusion which those who are in power introduce to impede the ordinary\ncourse of justice; which sufficiently shows what is the nature of the\ngovernment, or rather lawless force: for it is usual with the principal\npersons amongst them to collect together some of the common people and\ntheir friends, and then revolt and set up for themselves, and come\nto blows with each other. And what is the difference, if a state is\ndissolved at once by such violent means, or if it gradually so alters in\nprocess of time as to be no longer the same constitution? A state like\nthis would ever be exposed to the invasions of those who were powerful\nand inclined to attack it; but, as has been already mentioned, its\nsituation preserves it, as it is free from the inroads of foreigners;\nand for this reason the family slaves still remain quiet at Crete, while\nthe Helots are perpetually revolting: for the Cretans take no part in\nforeign affairs, and it is but lately that any foreign troops have\nmade an attack upon the island; and their ravages soon proved the\nineffectualness of their laws. And thus much for the government of\nCrete.\nCHAPTER XI\nThe government of Carthage seems well established, and in many respects\nsuperior to others; in some particulars it bears a near resemblance\nto the Lacedaemonians; and indeed these three states, the Cretans, the\nLacedaemonians and the Carthaginians are in some things very like\neach other, in others they differ greatly. Amongst many excellent\nconstitutions this may show how well their government is framed, that\nalthough the people are admitted to a share in the administration, the\nform of it remains unaltered, without any popular insurrections, worth\nnotice, on the one hand, or degenerating into a tyranny on the\nother. Now the Carthaginians have these things in common with the\nLacedaemonians: public tables for those who are connected together by\nthe tie of mutual friendship, after the manner of their Phiditia; they\nhave also a magistracy, consisting of an hundred and four persons,\nsimilar to the ephori, or rather selected with more judgment; for\namongst the Lacedaemonians, all the citizens are eligible, but amongst\nthe Carthaginians, they are chosen out of those of the better sort:\nthere is also some analogy between the king and the senate in both these\ngovernments, though the Carthaginian method of appointing their kings\nis best, for they do not confine themselves to one family; nor do\nthey permit the election to be at large, nor have they any regard to\nseniority; for if amongst the candidates there are any of greater merit\nthan the rest, these they prefer to those who may be older; for as their\npower is very extensive, if they are [1273a] persons of no account,\nthey may be very hurtful to the state, as they have always been to\nthe Lacedaemonians; also the greater part of those things which become\nreprehensible by their excess are common to all those governments which\nwe have described.\nNow of those principles on which the Carthaginians have established\ntheir mixed form of government, composed of an aristocracy and\ndemocracy, some incline to produce a democracy, others an oligarchy: for\ninstance, if the kings and the senate are unanimous upon any point in\ndebate, they can choose whether they will bring it before the people or\nno; but if they disagree, it is to these they must appeal, who are not\nonly to hear what has been approved of by the senate, but are finally\nto determine upon it; and whosoever chooses it, has a right to speak\nagainst any matter whatsoever that may be proposed, which is not\npermitted in other cases. The five, who elect each other, have very\ngreat and extensive powers; and these choose the hundred, who are\nmagistrates of the highest rank: their power also continues longer than\nany other magistrates, for it commences before they come into office,\nand is prolonged after they are out of it; and in this particular the\nstate inclines to an oligarchy: but as they are not elected by lot, but\nby suffrage, and are not permitted to take money, they are the greatest\nsupporters imaginable of an aristocracy.\nThe determining all causes by the same magistrates, and not orae in one\ncourt and another in another, as at Lacedaemon, has the same influence.\nThe constitution of Carthage is now shifting from an aristocracy to an\noligarchy, in consequence of an opinion which is favourably entertained\nby many, who think that the magistrates in the community ought not to\nbe persons of family only, but of fortune also; as it is impossible\nfor those who are in bad circumstances to support the dignity of their\noffice, or to be at leisure to apply to public business. As choosing men\nof fortune to be magistrates make a state incline to an oligarchy,\nand men of abilities to an aristocracy, so is there a third method of\nproceeding which took place in the polity of Carthage; for they have\nan eye to these two particulars when they elect their officers,\nparticularly those of the highest rank, their kings and their generals.\nIt must be admitted, that it was a great fault in their legislator not\nto guard against the constitution's degenerating from an aristocracy;\nfor this is a most necessary thing to provide for at first, that those\ncitizens who have the best abilities should never be obliged to do\nanything unworthy their character, but be always at leisure to serve the\npublic, not only when in office, but also when private persons; for if\nonce you are obliged to look among the wealthy, that you may have men at\nleisure to serve you, your greatest offices, of king and general,\nwill soon become venal; in consequence of which, riches will be more\nhonourable than virtue and a love of money be the ruling principle in\nthe city-for what those who have the chief power regard as honourable\nwill necessarily be the object which the [1273b] citizens in general\nwill aim at; and where the first honours are not paid to virtue,\nthere the aristocratic form of government cannot flourish: for it\nis reasonable to conclude, that those who bought their places should\ngenerally make an advantage of what they laid out their money for; as\nit is absurd to suppose, that if a man of probity who is poor should be\ndesirous of gaining something, a bad man should not endeavour to do the\nsame, especially to reimburse himself; for which reason the magistracy\nshould be formed of those who are most able to support an aristocracy.\nIt would have been better for the legislature to have passed over the\npoverty of men of merit, and only to have taken care to have ensured\nthem sufficient leisure, when in office, to attend to public affairs.\nIt seems also improper, that one person should execute several offices,\nwhich was approved of at Carthage; for one business is best done by one\nperson; and it is the duty of the legislator to look to this, and not\nmake the same person a musician and a shoemaker: so that where the state\nis not small it is more politic and more popular to admit many persons\nto have a share in the government; for, as I just now said, it is not\nonly more usual, but everything is better and sooner done, when one\nthing only is allotted to one person: and this is evident both in the\narmy and navy, where almost every one, in his turn, both commands and\nis under command. But as their government inclines to an oligarchy, they\navoid the ill effects of it by always appointing some of the popular\nparty to the government of cities to make their fortunes. Thus they\nconsult this fault in their constitution and render it stable; but\nthis is depending on chance; whereas the legislator ought to frame his\ngovernment, that there the no room for insurrections. But now, if there\nshould be any general calamity, and the people should revolt from their\nrulers, there is no remedy for reducing them to obedience by the laws.\nAnd these are the particulars of the Lacedaemonian, the Cretan, and the\nCarthaginian governments which seem worthy of commendation.\nCHAPTER XII\nSome of those persons who have written upon government had never any\nshare in public affairs, but always led a private life. Everything\nworthy of notice in their works we have already spoke to. Others\nwere legislators, some in their own cities, others were employed in\nregulating the governments of foreign states. Some of them only composed\na body of laws; others formed the constitution also, as Lycurgus; and\nSolon, who did both. The Lacedaemonians have been already mentioned.\nSome persons think that Solon was an excellent legislator, who could\ndissolve a pure oligarchy, and save the people from that slavery which\nhung over them, and establish the ancient democratic form of government\nin his country; wherein every part of it was so framed as to be well\nadapted to the whole. In the senate of Areopagus an oligarchy was\npreserved; by the manner of electing their [1274a] magistrates, an\naristocracy; and in their courts of justice, a democracy.\nSolon seems not to have altered the established form of government,\neither with respect to the senate or the mode of electing their\nmagistrates; but to have raised the people to great consideration in the\nstate by allotting the supreme judicial department to them; and for this\nsome persons blame him, as having done what would soon overturn that\nbalance of power he intended to establish; for by trying all causes\nwhatsoever before the people, who were chosen by lot to determine them,\nit was necessary to flatter a tyrannical populace who had got this\npower; which contributed to bring the government to that pure democracy\nit now is.\nBoth Ephialtes and Pericles abridged the power of the Areopagites, the\nlatter of whom introduced the method of paying those who attended\nthe courts of justice: and thus every one who aimed at being popular\nproceeded increasing the power of the people to what we now see it. But\nit is evident that this was not Solon's intention, but that it arose\nfrom accident; for the people being the cause of the naval victory\nover the Medes, assumed greatly upon it, and enlisted themselves\nunder factious demagogues, although opposed by the better part of the\ncitizens. He thought it indeed most necessary to entrust the people\nwith the choice of their magistrates and the power of calling them to\naccount; for without that they must have been slaves and enemies to the\nother citizens: but he ordered them to elect those only who were persons\nof good account and property, either out of those who were worth five\nhundred medimns, or those who were called xeugitai, or those of the\nthird census, who were called horsemen.\nAs for those of the fourth, which consisted of mechanics, they were\nincapable of any office. Zaleucus was the legislator of the Western\nLocrians, as was Charondas, the Catanean, of his own cities, and those\nalso in Italy and Sicily which belonged to the Calcidians. Some persons\nendeavour to prove that Onomacritus, the Locrian, was the first person\nof note who drew up laws; and that he employed himself in that business\nwhile he was at Crete, where he continued some time to learn the\nprophetic art: and they say, that Thales was his companion; and that\nLycurgus and Zaleucus were the scholars of Thales, and Charondas of\nZaleucus; but those who advance this, advance what is repugnant to\nchronology. Philolaus also, of the family of the Bacchiades, was a\nTheban legislator. This man was very fond of Diocles, a victor in\nthe Olympic games, and when he left his country from a disgust at an\nimproper passion which his mother Alithoe had entertained for him, and\nsettled at Thebes, Philolaus followed him, where they both died, and\nwhere they still show their tombs placed in view of each other, but so\ndisposed, that one of them looks towards Corinth, the other does not;\nthe reason they give for this is, that Diodes, from his detestation of\nhis mother's passion, would have his tomb so placed that no one could\nsee Corinth from it; but Philolaus chose that it might be seen from his:\nand this was the cause of their living at Thebes. [1274b]\nAs Philolaus gave them laws concerning many other things, so did he upon\nadoption, which they call adoptive laws; and this he in particular did\nto preserve the number of families. Charondas did nothing new, except\nin actions for perjury, which he was the first person who took into\nparticular consideration. He also drew up his laws with greater elegance\nand accuracy than even any of our present legislators. Philolaus\nintroduced the law for the equal distribution of goods; Plato that for\nthe community of women, children, and goods, and also for public tables\nfor the women; and one concerning drunkenness, that they might observe\nsobriety in their symposiums. He also made a law concerning their\nwarlike exercises; that they should acquire a habit of using both hands\nalike, as it was necessary that one hand should be as useful as the\nother.\nAs for Draco's laws, they were published when the government was already\nestablished, and they have nothing particular in them worth mentioning,\nexcept their severity on account of the enormity of their punishments.\nPittacus was the author of some laws, but never drew up any form of\ngovernment; one of which was this, that if a drunken man beat any person\nhe should be punished more than if he did it when sober; for as\npeople are more apt to be abusive when drunk than sober, he paid no\nconsideration to the excuse which drunkenness might claim, but regarded\nonly the common benefit. Andromadas Regmus was also a lawgiver to the\nThracian talcidians. There are some laws of his concerning murders and\nheiresses extant, but these contain nothing that any one can say is new\nand his own. And thus much for different sorts of governments, as well\nthose which really exist as those which different persons have proposed.\nBOOK III\nCHAPTER I\nEvery one who inquires into the nature of government, and what are its\ndifferent forms, should make this almost his first question, What is a\ncity? For upon this there is a dispute: for some persons say the city\ndid this or that, while others say, not the city, but the oligarchy,\nor the tyranny. We see that the city is the only object which both the\npolitician and legislator have in view in all they do: but government\nis a certain ordering of those who inhabit a city. As a city is a\ncollective body, and, like other wholes, composed of many parts, it is\nevident our first inquiry must be, what a citizen is: for a city is a\ncertain number of citizens. So that we must consider whom we ought to\ncall citizen, and who is one; for this is often doubtful: for every one\nwill not allow that this character is applicable to the same person; for\nthat man who would be a citizen in a republic would very often not be\none in an oligarchy. We do not include in this inquiry many of those who\nacquire this appellation out of the ordinary way, as honorary persons,\nfor instance, but those only who have a natural right to it.\nNow it is not residence which constitutes a man a citizen; for in this\nsojourners and slaves are upon an equality with him; nor will it be\nsufficient for this purpose, that you have the privilege of the laws,\nand may plead or be impleaded, for this all those of different nations,\nbetween whom there is a mutual agreement for that purpose, are allowed;\nalthough it very often happens, that sojourners have not a perfect right\ntherein without the protection of a patron, to whom they are obliged to\napply, which shows that their share in the community is incomplete. In\nlike manner, with respect to boys who are not yet enrolled, or old men\nwho are past war, we admit that they are in some respects citizens,\nbut not completely so, but with some exceptions, for these are not yet\narrived to years of maturity, and those are past service; nor is\nthere any difference between them. But what we mean is sufficiently\nintelligible and clear, we want a complete citizen, one in whom there\nis no deficiency to be corrected to make him so. As to those who are\nbanished, or infamous, there may be the same objections made and the\nsame answer given. There is nothing that more characterises a complete\ncitizen than having a share in the judicial and executive part of the\ngovernment.\nWith respect to offices, some are fixed to a particular time, so that\nno person is, on any account, permitted to fill them twice; or else\nnot till some certain period has intervened; others are not fixed, as a\njuryman's, and a member of the general assembly: but probably some one\nmay say these are not offices, nor have the citizens in these capacities\nany share in the government; though surely it is ridiculous to say that\nthose who have the principal power in the state bear no office in it.\nBut this objection is of no weight, for it is only a dispute about\nwords; as there is no general term which can be applied both to the\noffice of a juryman and a member of the assembly. For the sake of\ndistinction, suppose we call it an indeterminate office: but I lay it\ndown as a maxim, that those are citizens who could exercise it. Such\nthen is the description of a citizen who comes nearest to what all those\nwho are called citizens are. Every one also should know, that of the\ncomponent parts of those things which differ from each other in species,\nafter the first or second remove, those which follow have either nothing\nat all or very little common to each.\nNow we see that governments differ from each other in their form,\nand that some of them are defective, others [1275b] as excellent as\npossible: for it is evident, that those which have many deficiencies\nand degeneracies in them must be far inferior to those which are without\nsuch faults. What I mean by degeneracies will be hereafter explained.\nHence it is clear that the office of a citizen must differ as\ngovernments do from each other: for which reason he who is called\na citizen has, in a democracy, every privilege which that station\nsupposes. In other forms of government he may enjoy them; but not\nnecessarily: for in some states the people have no power; nor have they\nany general assembly, but a few select men.\nThe trial also of different causes is allotted to different persons; as\nat Lacedaemon all disputes concerning contracts are brought before some\nof the ephori: the senate are the judges in cases of murder, and so on;\nsome being to be heard by one magistrate, others by another: and thus\nat Carthage certain magistrates determine all causes. But our former\ndescription of a citizen will admit of correction; for in some\ngovernments the office of a juryman and a member of the general assembly\nis not an indeterminate one; but there are particular persons appointed\nfor these purposes, some or all of the citizens being appointed jurymen\nor members of the general assembly, and this either for all causes and\nall public business whatsoever, or else for some particular one: and\nthis may be sufficient to show what a citizen is; for he who has a right\nto a share in the judicial and executive part of government in any\ncity, him we call a citizen of that place; and a city, in one word, is\na collective body of such persons sufficient in themselves to all the\npurposes of life.\nCHAPTER II\nIn common use they define a citizen to be one who is sprung from\ncitizens on both sides, not on the father's or the mother's only. Others\ncarry the matter still further, and inquire how many of his ancestors\nhave been citizens, as his grandfather, great-grandfather, etc., but\nsome persons have questioned how the first of the family could prove\nthemselves citizens, according to this popular and careless definition.\nGorgias of Leontium, partly entertaining the same doubt, and partly in\njest, says, that as a mortar is made by a mortar-maker, so a citizen is\nmade by a citizen-maker, and a Larisssean by a Larisssean-maker. This\nis indeed a very simple account of the matter; for if citizens are so,\naccording to this definition, it will be impossible to apply it to the\nfirst founders or first inhabitants of states, who cannot possibly claim\nin right either of their father or mother. It is probably a matter of\nstill more difficulty to determine their rights as citizens who are\nadmitted to their freedom after any revolution in the state. As, for\ninstance, at Athens, after the expulsion of the tyrants, when Clisthenes\nenrolled many foreigners and city-slaves amongst the tribes; and the\ndoubt with respect to them was, not whether they were citizens or no,\nbut whether they were legally so or not. Though indeed some persons may\nhave this further [1276a] doubt, whether a citizen can be a citizen\nwhen he is illegally made; as if an illegal citizen, and one who is\nno citizen at all, were in the same predicament: but since we see some\npersons govern unjustly, whom yet we admit to govern, though not justly,\nand the definition of a citizen is one who exercises certain offices,\nfor such a one we have defined a citizen to be, it is evident, that a\ncitizen illegally created yet continues to be a citizen, but whether\njustly or unjustly so belongs to the former inquiry.\nCHAPTER III\nIt has also been doubted what was and what was not the act of the city;\nas, for instance, when a democracy arises out of an aristocracy or a\ntyranny; for some persons then refuse to fulfil their contracts; as if\nthe right to receive the money was in the tyrant and not in the state,\nand many other things of the same nature; as if any covenant was founded\nfor violence and not for the common good. So in like manner, if anything\nis done by those who have the management of public affairs where a\ndemocracy is established, their actions are to be considered as the\nactions of the state, as well as in the oligarchy or tyranny.\nAnd here it seems very proper to consider this question, When shall we\nsay that a city is the same, and when shall we say that it is different?\nIt is but a superficial mode of examining into this question to begin\nwith the place and the people; for it may happen that these may be\ndivided from that, or that some one of them may live in one place, and\nsome in another (but this question may be regarded as no very knotty\none; for, as a city may acquire that appellation on many accounts,\nit may be solved many ways); and in like manner, when men inhabit one\ncommon place, when shall we say that they inhabit the same city, or that\nthe city is the same? for it does not depend upon the walls; for I can\nsuppose Peloponnesus itself surrounded with a wall, as Babylon was, and\nevery other place, which rather encircles many nations than one city,\nand that they say was taken three days when some of the inhabitants\nknew nothing of it: but we shall find a proper time to determine this\nquestion; for the extent of a city, how large it should be, and whether\nit should consist of more than one people, these are particulars that\nthe politician should by no means be unacquainted with. This, too, is a\nmatter of inquiry, whether we shall say that a city is the same while\nit is inhabited by the same race of men, though some of them are\nperpetually dying, others coming into the world, as we say that a river\nor a fountain is the same, though the waters are continually changing;\nor when a revolution takes place shall we [1276b] say the men are the\nsame, but the city is different: for if a city is a community, it is a\ncommunity of citizens; but if the mode of government should alter, and\nbecome of another sort, it would seem a necessary consequence that the\ncity is not the same; as we regard the tragic chorus as different from\nthe comic, though it may probably consist of the same performers: thus\nevery other community or composition is said to be different if the\nspecies of composition is different; as in music the same hands produce\ndifferent harmony, as the Doric and Phrygian. If this is true, it is\nevident, that when we speak of a city as being the same we refer to the\ngovernment there established; and this, whether it is called by the\nsame name or any other, or inhabited by the same men or different.\nBut whether or no it is right to dissolve the community when the\nconstitution is altered is another question.\nCHAPTER IV\nWhat has been said, it follows that we should consider whether the\nsame virtues which constitute a good man make a valuable citizen, or\ndifferent; and if a particular inquiry is necessary for this matter we\nmust first give a general description of the virtues of a good citizen;\nfor as a sailor is one of those who make up a community, so is a\ncitizen, although the province of one sailor may be different from\nanother's (for one is a rower, another a steersman, a third a boatswain,\nand so on, each having their several appointments), it is evident that\nthe most accurate description of any one good sailor must refer to\nhis peculiar abilities, yet there are some things in which the same\ndescription may be applied to the whole crew, as the safety of the ship\nis the common business of all of them, for this is the general centre of\nall their cares: so also with respect to citizens, although they may\nin a few particulars be very different, yet there is one care common to\nthem all, the safety of the community, for the community of the citizens\ncomposes the state; for which reason the virtue of a citizen has\nnecessarily a reference to the state. But if there are different sorts\nof governments, it is evident that those actions which constitute the\nvirtue of an excellent citizen in one community will not constitute it\nin another; wherefore the virtue of such a one cannot be perfect: but we\nsay, a man is good when his virtues are perfect; from whence it follows,\nthat an excellent citizen does not possess that virtue which constitutes\na good man. Those who are any ways doubtful concerning this question\nmay be convinced of the truth of it by examining into the best formed\nstates: for, if it is impossible that a city should consist entirely of\nexcellent citizens (while it is necessary that every one should do well\nin his calling, in which consists his excellence, as it is impossible\nthat all the citizens should have the same [1277a] qualifications) it\nis impossible that the virtue of a citizen and a good man should be the\nsame; for all should possess the virtue of an excellent citizen: for\nfrom hence necessarily arise the perfection of the city: but that every\none should possess the virtue of a good man is impossible without\nall the citizens in a well-regulated state were necessarily virtuous.\nBesides, as a city is composed of dissimilar parts, as an animal is of\nlife and body; the soul of reason and appetite; a family of a man and\nhis wife--property of a master and a slave; in the same manner, as a\ncity is composed of all these and many other very different parts, it\nnecessarily follows that the virtue of all the citizens cannot be the\nsame; as the business of him who leads the band is different from the\nother dancers. From all which proofs it is evident that the virtues of\na citizen cannot be one and the same. But do we never find those virtues\nunited which constitute a good man and excellent citizen? for we say,\nsuch a one is an excellent magistrate and a prudent and good man; but\nprudence is a necessary qualification for all those who engage in public\naffairs. Nay, some persons affirm that the education of those who are\nintended to command should, from the beginning, be different from other\ncitizens, as the children of kings are generally instructed in riding\nand warlike exercises; and thus Euripides says:\n\"... No showy arts Be mine, but teach me what the state requires.\"\nAs if those who are to rule were to have an education peculiar to\nthemselves. But if we allow, that the virtues of a good man and a\ngood magistrate may be the same, and a citizen is one who obeys the\nmagistrate, it follows that the virtue of the one cannot in general be\nthe same as the virtue of the other, although it may be true of some\nparticular citizen; for the virtue of the magistrate must be different\nfrom the virtue of the citizen. For which reason Jason declared that\nwas he deprived of his kingdom he should pine away with regret, as not\nknowing how to live a private man. But it is a great recommendation to\nknow how to command as well as to obey; and to do both these things well\nis the virtue of an accomplished citizen. If then the virtue of a good\nman consists only in being able to command, but the virtue of a good\ncitizen renders him equally fit for the one as well as the other, the\ncommendation of both of them is not the same. It appears, then, that\nboth he who commands and he who obeys should each of them learn their\nseparate business: but that the citizen should be master of and\ntake part in both these, as any one may easily perceive; in a family\ngovernment there is no occasion for the master to know how to perform\nthe necessary offices, but rather to enjoy the labour of others; for to\ndo the other is a servile part. I mean by the other, the common family\nbusiness of the slave.\nThere are many sorts of slaves; for their employments are various: of\nthese the handicraftsmen are one, who, as their name imports, get their\nliving by the labour of their hands, and amongst these all mechanics are\nincluded; [1277b] for which reasons such workmen, in some states, were\nnot formerly admitted into any share in the government; till at length\ndemocracies were established: it is not therefore proper for any man\nof honour, or any citizen, or any one who engages in public affairs, to\nlearn these servile employments without they have occasion for them for\ntheir own use; for without this was observed the distinction between a\nmaster and a slave would be lost. But there is a government of another\nsort, in which men govern those who are their equals in rank, and\nfreemen, which we call a political government, in which men learn to\ncommand by first submitting to obey, as a good general of horse, or a\ncommander-in-chief, must acquire a knowledge of their duty by\nhaving been long under the command of another, and the like in every\nappointment in the army: for well is it said, no one knows how to\ncommand who has not himself been under command of another. The virtues\nof those are indeed different, but a good citizen must necessarily be\nendowed with them; he ought also to know in what manner freemen ought\nto govern, as well as be governed: and this, too, is the duty of a good\nman. And if the temperance and justice of him who commands is different\nfrom his who, though a freeman, is under command, it is evident that the\nvirtues of a good citizen cannot be the same as justice, for instance\nbut must be of a different species in these two different situations, as\nthe temperance and courage of a man and a woman are different from each\nother; for a man would appear a coward who had only that courage which\nwould be graceful in a woman, and a woman would be thought a talker who\nshould take as large a part in the conversation as would become a man of\nconsequence.\nThe domestic employments of each of them are also different; it is the\nman's business to acquire subsistence, the woman's to take care of it.\nBut direction and knowledge of public affairs is a virtue peculiar to\nthose who govern, while all others seem to be equally requisite for both\nparties; but with this the governed have no concern, it is theirs to\nentertain just notions: they indeed are like flute-makers, while those\nwho govern are the musicians who play on them. And thus much to show\nwhether the virtue of a good man and an excellent citizen is the same,\nor if it is different, and also how far it is the same, and how far\ndifferent.\nCHAPTER V\nBut with respect to citizens there is a doubt remaining, whether those\nonly are truly so who are allowed to share in the government, or whether\nthe mechanics also are to be considered as such? for if those who are\nnot permitted to rule are to be reckoned among them, it is impossible\nthat the virtue of all the citizens should be the same, for these also\nare citizens; and if none of them are admitted to be citizens, where\nshall they be ranked? for they are neither [1278a] sojourners nor\nforeigners? or shall we say that there will no inconvenience arise from\ntheir not being citizens, as they are neither slaves nor freedmen:\nfor this is certainly true, that all those are not citizens who are\nnecessary to the existence of a city, as boys are not citizens in the\nsame manner that men are, for those are perfectly so, the others under\nsome conditions; for they are citizens, though imperfect ones: for\nin former times among some people the mechanics were either slaves or\nforeigners, for which reason many of them are so now: and indeed the\nbest regulated states will not permit a mechanic to be a citizen; but\nif it be allowed them, we cannot then attribute the virtue we have\ndescribed to every citizen or freeman, but to those only who are\ndisengaged from servile offices. Now those who are employed by one\nperson in them are slaves; those who do them for money are mechanics\nand hired servants: hence it is evident on the least reflection what is\ntheir situation, for what I have said is fully explained by appearances.\nSince the number of communities is very great, it follows necessarily\nthat there will be many different sorts of citizens, particularly\nof those who are governed by others, so that in one state it may be\nnecessary to admit mechanics and hired servants to be citizens, but in\nothers it may be impossible; as particularly in an aristocracy, where\nhonours are bestowed on virtue and dignity: for it is impossible for\none who lives the life of a mechanic or hired servant to acquire the\npractice of virtue. In an oligarchy also hired servants are not admitted\nto be citizens; because there a man's right to bear any office is\nregulated by his fortune; but mechanics are, for many citizens are very\nrich.\nThere was a law at Thebes that no one could have a share in the\ngovernment till he had been ten years out of trade. In many states the\nlaw invites strangers to accept the freedom of the city; and in some\ndemocracies the son of a free-woman is himself free. The same is also\nobserved in many others with respect to natural children; but it is\nthrough want of citizens regularly born that they admit such: for these\nlaws are always made in consequence of a scarcity of inhabitants; so,\nas their numbers increase, they first deprive the children of a male or\nfemale slave of this privilege, next the child of a free-woman, and last\nof all they will admit none but those whose fathers and mothers were\nboth free.\nThat there are many sorts of citizens, and that he may be said to be as\ncompletely who shares the honours of the state, is evident from what\nhas been already said. Thus Achilles, in Homer, complains of Agamemnon's\ntreating him like an unhonoured stranger; for a stranger or sojourner is\none who does not partake of the honours of the state: and whenever the\nright to the freedom of the city is kept obscure, it is for the sake of\nthe inhabitants. [1278b] From what has been said it is plain whether the\nvirtue of a good man and an excellent citizen is the same or different:\nand we find that in some states it is the same, in others not; and also\nthat this is not true of each citizen, but of those only who take the\nlead, or are capable of taking the lead, in public affairs, either alone\nor in conjunction with others.\nCHAPTER VI\nHaving established these points, we proceed next to consider whether one\nform of government only should be established, or more than one; and if\nmore, how many, and of what sort, and what are the differences between\nthem. The form of government is the ordering and regulating of the city,\nand all the offices in it, particularly those wherein the supreme power\nis lodged; and this power is always possessed by the administration; but\nthe administration itself is that particular form of government which\nis established in any state: thus in a democracy the supreme power is\nlodged in the whole people; on the contrary, in an oligarchy it is in\nthe hands of a few. We say then, that the form of government in these\nstates is different, and we shall find the same thing hold good in\nothers. Let us first determine for whose sake a city is established;\nand point out the different species of rule which man may submit to in\nsocial life.\nI have already mentioned in my treatise on the management of a family,\nand the power of the master, that man is an animal naturally formed\nfor society, and that therefore, when he does not want any foreign\nassistance, he will of his own accord desire to live with others; not\nbut that mutual advantage induces them to it, as far as it enables each\nperson to live more agreeably; and this is indeed the great object\nnot only to all in general, but also to each individual: but it is not\nmerely matter of choice, but they join in society also, even that they\nmay be able to live, which probably is not without some share of merit,\nand they also support civil society, even for the sake of preserving\nlife, without they are grievously overwhelmed with the miseries of it:\nfor it is very evident that men will endure many calamities for the sake\nof living, as being something naturally sweet and desirable. It is easy\nto point out the different modes of government, and we have already\nsettled them in our exoteric discourses. The power of the master, though\nby nature equally serviceable, both to the master and to the slave, yet\nnevertheless has for its object the benefit of the master, while the\nbenefit of the slave arises accidentally; for if the slave is destroyed,\nthe power of the master is at an end: but the authority which a man\nhas over his wife, and children, and his family, which we call domestic\ngovernment, is either for the benefit of those who are under subjection,\nor else for the common benefit of the whole: but its particular object\nis the benefit of the governed, as we see in other arts; in physic, for\ninstance, and the gymnastic exercises, wherein, if any benefit [1279a]\narise to the master, it is accidental; for nothing forbids the master of\nthe exercises from sometimes being himself one of those who exercises,\nas the steersman is always one of the sailors; but both the master of\nthe exercises and the steersman consider the good of those who are under\ntheir government. Whatever good may happen to the steersman when he is\na sailor, or to the master of the exercises when he himself makes one at\nthe games, is not intentional, or the object of their power; thus in all\npolitical governments which are established to preserve and defend the\nequality of the citizens it is held right to rule by turns. Formerly, as\nwas natural, every one expected that each of his fellow-citizens should\nin his turn serve the public, and thus administer to his private good,\nas he himself when in office had done for others; but now every one is\ndesirous of being continually in power, that he may enjoy the advantage\nwhich he makes of public business and being in office; as if places were\na never-failing remedy for every complaint, and were on that account so\neagerly sought after.\nIt is evident, then, that all those governments which have a common good\nin view are rightly established and strictly just, but those who have\nin view only the good of the rulers are all founded on wrong principles,\nand are widely different from what a government ought to be, for they\nare tyranny over slaves, whereas a city is a community of freemen.\nCHAPTER VII\nHaving established these particulars, we come to consider next the\ndifferent number of governments which there are, and what they are; and\nfirst, what are their excellencies: for when we have determined this,\ntheir defects will be evident enough.\nIt is evident that every form of government or administration, for the\nwords are of the same import, must contain a supreme power over the\nwhole state, and this supreme power must necessarily be in the hands\nof one person, or a few, or many; and when either of these apply their\npower for the common good, such states are well governed; but when the\ninterest of the one, the few, or the many who enjoy this power is alone\nconsulted, then ill; for you must either affirm that those who make\nup the community are not citizens, or else let these share in the\nadvantages of government. We usually call a state which is governed by\none person for the common good, a kingdom; one that is governed by\nmore than one, but by a few only, an aristocracy; either because the\ngovernment is in the hands of the most worthy citizens, or because it\nis the best form for the city and its inhabitants. When the citizens at\nlarge govern for the public good, it is called a state; which is also\na common name for all other governments, and these distinctions are\nconsonant to reason; for it will not be difficult to find one person,\nor a very few, of very distinguished abilities, but almost impossible to\nmeet with the majority [1279b] of a people eminent for every virtue;\nbut if there is one common to a whole nation it is valour; for this is\ncreated and supported by numbers: for which reason in such a state\nthe profession of arms will always have the greatest share in the\ngovernment.\nNow the corruptions attending each of these governments are these; a\nkingdom may degenerate into a tyranny, an aristocracy into an oligarchy,\nand a state into a democracy. Now a tyranny is a monarchy where the good\nof one man only is the object of government, an oligarchy considers\nonly the rich, and a democracy only the poor; but neither of them have a\ncommon good in view.\nCHAPTER VIII\nIt will be necessary to enlarge a little more upon the nature of each\nof these states, which is not without some difficulty, for he who would\nenter into a philosophical inquiry into the principles of them, and not\ncontent himself with a superficial view of their outward conduct, must\npass over and omit nothing, but explain the true spirit of each of them.\nA tyranny then is, as has been said, a monarchy, where one person has\nan absolute and despotic power over the whole community and every member\ntherein: an oligarchy, where the supreme power of the state is lodged\nwith the rich: a democracy, on the contrary, is where those have it who\nare worth little or nothing. But the first difficulty that arises from\nthe distinctions which we have laid down is this, should it happen that\nthe majority of the inhabitants who possess the power of the state (for\nthis is a democracy) should be rich, the question is, how does this\nagree with what we have said? The same difficulty occurs, should it ever\nhappen that the poor compose a smaller part of the people than the rich,\nbut from their superior abilities acquire the supreme power; for this is\nwhat they call an oligarchy; it should seem then that our definition\nof the different states was not correct: nay, moreover, could any one\nsuppose that the majority of the people were poor, and the minority\nrich, and then describe the state in this manner, that an oligarchy\nwas a government in which the rich, being few in number, possessed the\nsupreme power, and that a democracy was a state in which the poor, being\nmany in number, possessed it, still there will be another difficulty;\nfor what name shall we give to those states we have been describing? I\nmean, that in which the greater number are rich, and that in which the\nlesser number are poor (where each of these possess the supreme power),\nif there are no other states than those we have described. It seems\ntherefore evident to reason, that whether the supreme power is vested\nin the hands of many or few may be a matter of accident; but that it\nis clear enough, that when it is in the hands of the few, it will be\na government of the rich; when in the hands of the many, it will be a\ngovernment of the poor; since in all countries there are many poor and\nfew rich: it is not therefore the cause that has been already assigned\n(namely, the number of people in power) that makes the difference\nbetween the two governments; but an oligarchy and democracy differ in\nthis from each other, in the poverty of those who govern in the one,\nand the riches I28oa of those who govern in the other; for when the\ngovernment is in the hands of the rich, be they few or be they more, it\nis an oligarchy; when it is in the hands of the poor, it is a democracy:\nbut, as we have already said, the one will be always few, the other\nnumerous, but both will enjoy liberty; and from the claims of wealth and\nliberty will arise continual disputes with each other for the lead in\npublic affairs.\nCHAPTER IX\nLet us first determine what are the proper limits of an oligarchy and\na democracy, and what is just in each of these states; for all men have\nsome natural inclination to justice; but they proceed therein only to\na certain degree; nor can they universally point out what is absolutely\njust; as, for instance, what is equal appears just, and is so; but not\nto all; only among those who are equals: and what is unequal appears\njust, and is so; but not to all, only amongst those who are unequals;\nwhich circumstance some people neglect, and therefore judge ill; the\nreason for which is, they judge for themselves, and every one almost is\nthe worst judge in his own cause. Since then justice has reference to\npersons, the same distinctions must be made with respect to persons\nwhich are made with respect to things, in the manner that I have already\ndescribed in my Ethics.\nAs to the equality of the things, these they agree in; but their dispute\nis concerning the equality of the persons, and chiefly for the reason\nabove assigned; because they judge ill in their own cause; and also\nbecause each party thinks, that if they admit what is right in some\nparticulars, they have done justice on the whole: thus, for instance,\nif some persons are unequal in riches, they suppose them unequal in the\nwhole; or, on the contrary, if they are equal in liberty, they suppose\nthem equal in the whole: but what is absolutely just they omit; for\nif civil society was founded for the sake of preserving and increasing\nproperty, every one's right in the city would be equal to his fortune;\nand then the reasoning of those who insist upon an oligarchy would be\nvalid; for it would not be right that he who contributed one mina should\nhave an equal share in the hundred along with him who brought in all the\nrest, either of the original money or what was afterwards acquired.\nNor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of its\nmembers; but that they might live well: for otherwise a state might\nbe composed of slaves, or the animal creation: but this is not so; for\nthese have no share in the happiness of it; nor do they live after their\nown choice; nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from\ninjuries, or for a commercial intercourse: for then the Tyrrhenians and\nCarthaginians, and all other nations between whom treaties of commerce\nsubsist, would be citizens of one city; for they have articles\nto regulate their exports and imports, and engagements for mutual\nprotection, and alliances for mutual defence; but [1280b] yet they\nhave not all the same magistrates established among them, but they are\ndifferent among the different people; nor does the one take any care,\nthat the morals of the other should be as they ought, or that none of\nthose who have entered into the common agreements should be unjust, or\nin any degree vicious, only that they do not injure any member of the\nconfederacy. But whosoever endeavours to establish wholesome laws in\na state, attends to the virtues and the vices of each individual who\ncomposes it; from whence it is evident, that the first care of him who\nwould found a city, truly deserving that name, and not nominally so,\nmust be to have his citizens virtuous; for otherwise it is merely an\nalliance for self-defence; differing from those of the same cast which\nare made between different people only in place: for law is an agreement\nand a pledge, as the sophist Lycophron says, between the citizens of\ntheir intending to do justice to each other, though not sufficient to\nmake all the citizens just and good: and that this is fact is evident,\nfor could any one bring different places together, as, for instance,\nenclose Megara and Corinth in a wall, yet they would not be one city,\nnot even if the inhabitants intermarried with each other, though this\ninter-community contributes much to make a place one city. Besides,\ncould we suppose a set of people to live separate from each other, but\nwithin such a distance as would admit of an intercourse, and that there\nwere laws subsisting between each party, to prevent their injuring one\nanother in their mutual dealings, supposing one a carpenter, another\na husbandman, shoemaker, and the like, and that their numbers were ten\nthousand, still all that they would have together in common would be a\ntariff for trade, or an alliance for mutual defence, but not the same\ncity. And why? not because their mutual intercourse is not near enough,\nfor even if persons so situated should come to one place, and every one\nshould live in his own house as in his native city, and there should be\nalliances subsisting between each party to mutually assist and prevent\nany injury being done to the other, still they would not be admitted\nto be a city by those who think correctly, if they preserved the same\ncustoms when they were together as when they were separate.\nIt is evident, then, that a city is not a community of place; nor\nestablished for the sake of mutual safety or traffic with each other;\nbut that these things are the necessary consequences of a city, although\nthey may all exist where there is no city: but a city is a society of\npeople joining together with their families and their children to live\nagreeably for the sake of having their lives as happy and as independent\nas possible: and for this purpose it is necessary that they should live\nin one place and intermarry with each other: hence in all cities there\nare family-meetings, clubs, sacrifices, and public entertainments to\npromote friendship; for a love of sociability is friendship itself;\nso that the end then for which a city is established is, that the\ninhabitants of it may live happy, and these things are conducive to that\nend: for it is a community of families and villages for the sake of a\nperfect independent life; that is, as we have already said, for the sake\nof living well and happily. It is not therefore founded for the purpose\nof men's merely [1281a] living together, but for their living as men\nought; for which reason those who contribute most to this end deserve to\nhave greater power in the city than those who are their equals in family\nand freedom, but their inferiors in civil virtue, or those who excel\nthem in wealth but are below them in worth. It is evident from what\nhas been said, that in all disputes upon government each party says\nsomething that is just.\nCHAPTER X\nIt may also be a doubt where the supreme power ought to be lodged.\nShall it be with the majority, or the wealthy, with a number of proper\npersons, or one better than the rest, or with a tyrant? But whichever\nof these we prefer some difficulty will arise. For what? shall the\npoor have it because they are the majority? they may then divide among\nthemselves, what belongs to the rich: nor is this unjust; because truly\nit has been so judged by the supreme power. But what avails it to point\nout what is the height of injustice if this is not? Again, if the many\nseize into their own hands everything which belongs to the few, it is\nevident that the city will be at an end. But virtue will never destroy\nwhat is virtuous; nor can what is right be the ruin of the state:\ntherefore such a law can never be right, nor can the acts of a tyrant\never be wrong, for of necessity they must all be just; for he, from his\nunlimited power, compels every one to obey his command, as the multitude\noppress the rich. Is it right then that the rich, the few, should have\nthe supreme power? and what if they be guilty of the same rapine and\nplunder the possessions of the majority, that will be as right as the\nother: but that all things of this sort are wrong and unjust is evident.\nWell then, these of the better sort shall have it: but must not then all\nthe other citizens live unhonoured, without sharing the offices of the\ncity; for the offices of a city are its honours, and if one set of men\nare always in power, it is evident that the rest must be without honour.\nWell then, let it be with one person of all others the fittest for it:\nbut by this means the power will be still more contracted, and a greater\nnumber than before continue unhonoured. But some one may say, that it is\nwrong to let man have the supreme power and not the law, as his soul is\nsubject to so many passions. But if this law appoints an aristocracy, or\na democracy, how will it help us in our present doubts? for those things\nwill happen which we have already mentioned.\nCHAPTER XI\nOther particulars we will consider separately; but it seems proper to\nprove, that the supreme power ought to be lodged with the many, rather\nthan with those of the better sort, who are few; and also to explain\nwhat doubts (and probably just ones) may arise: now, though not one\nindividual of the many may himself be fit for the supreme power, yet\nwhen these many are joined together, it does not follow but they may be\nbetter qualified for it than those; and this not separately, but as a\ncollective body; as the public suppers exceed those which are given at\none person's private expense: for, as they are many, each person brings\nin his share of virtue and wisdom; and thus, coming together, they are\nlike one man made up of a multitude, with many feet, many hands,\nand many intelligences: thus is it with respect to the manners and\nunderstandings of the multitude taken together; for which reason the\npublic are the best judges of music and poetry; for some understand\none part, some another, and all collectively the whole; and in this\nparticular men of consequence differ from each of the many; as they\nsay those who are beautiful do from those who are not so, and as fine\npictures excel any natural objects, by collecting the several beautiful\nparts which were dispersed among different originals into one, although\nthe separate parts, as the eye or any other, might be handsomer than in\nthe picture.\nBut if this distinction is to be made between every people and every\ngeneral assembly, and some few men of consequence, it may be doubtful\nwhether it is true; nay, it is clear enough that, with respect to a few,\nit is not; since the same conclusion might be applied even to brutes:\nand indeed wherein do some men differ from brutes? Not but that nothing\nprevents what I have said being true of the people in some states. The\ndoubt then which we have lately proposed, with all its consequences, may\nbe settled in this manner; it is necessary that the freemen who compose\nthe bulk of the people should have absolute power in some things; but as\nthey are neither men of property, nor act uniformly upon principles\nof virtue, it is not safe to trust them with the first offices in the\nstate, both on account of their iniquity and their ignorance; from\nthe one of which they will do what is wrong, from the other they will\nmistake: and yet it is dangerous to allow them no power or share in the\ngovernment; for when there are many poor people who are incapable of\nacquiring the honours of their country, the state must necessarily have\nmany enemies in it; let them then be permitted to vote in the public\nassemblies and to determine causes; for which reason Socrates, and some\nother legislators, gave them the power of electing the officers of the\nstate, and also of inquiring into their conduct when they came out of\noffice, and only prevented their being magistrates by themselves;\nfor the multitude when they are collected together have all of them\nsufficient understanding for these purposes, and, mixing among those of\nhigher rank, are serviceable to the city, as some things, which alone\nare improper for food, when mixed with others make the whole more\nwholesome than a few of them would be.\nBut there is a difficulty attending this form of government, for it\nseems, that the person who himself was capable of curing any one who\nwas then sick, must be the best judge whom to employ as a physician; but\nsuch a one must be himself a physician; and the same holds true in every\nother practice and art: and as a physician ought [1282a] to give an\naccount of his practice to a physician, so ought it to be in other arts:\nthose whose business is physic may be divided into three sorts, the\nfirst of these is he who makes up the medicines; the second prescribes,\nand is to the other as the architect is to the mason; the third is he\nwho understands the science, but never practises it: now these three\ndistinctions may be found in those who understand all other arts; nor\nhave we less opinion of their judgment who are only instructed in the\nprinciples of the art than of those who practise it: and with respect\nto elections the same method of proceeding seems right; for to elect a\nproper person in any science is the business of those who are skilful\ntherein; as in geometry, of geometricians; in steering, of steersmen:\nbut if some individuals should know something of particular arts and\nworks, they do not know more than the professors of them: so that even\nupon this principle neither the election of magistrates, nor the censure\nof their conduct, should be entrusted to the many.\nBut probably all that has been here said may not be right; for, to\nresume the argument I lately used, if the people are not very brutal\nindeed, although we allow that each individual knows less of these\naffairs than those who have given particular attention to them, yet when\nthey come together they will know them better, or at least not worse;\nbesides, in some particular arts it is not the workman only who is the\nbest judge; namely, in those the works of which are understood by those\nwho do not profess them: thus he who builds a house is not the only\njudge of it, for the master of the family who inhabits it is a better;\nthus also a steersman is a better judge of a tiller than he who made\nit; and he who gives an entertainment than the cook. What has been said\nseems a sufficient solution of this difficulty; but there is another\nthat follows: for it seems absurd that the power of the state should be\nlodged with those who are but of indifferent morals, instead of those\nwho are of excellent characters. Now the power of election and censure\nare of the utmost consequence, and this, as has been said, in some\nstates they entrust to the people; for the general assembly is the\nsupreme court of all, and they have a voice in this, and deliberate in\nall public affairs, and try all causes, without any objection to the\nmeanness of their circumstances, and at any age: but their treasurers,\ngenerals, and other great officers of state are taken from men of great\nfortune and worth. This difficulty also may be solved upon the same\nprinciple; and here too they may be right, for the power is not in the\nman who is member of the assembly, or council, but the assembly itself,\nand the council, and the people, of which each individual of the whole\ncommunity are the parts, I mean as senator, adviser, or judge; for which\nreason it is very right, that the many should have the greatest powers\nin their own hands; for the people, the council, and the judges are\ncomposed of them, and the property of all these collectively is more\nthan the property of any person or a few who fill the great offices of\nthe state: and thus I determine these points.\nThe first question that we stated shows plainly, that the supreme\npower should be lodged in laws duly made and that the magistrate or\nmagistrates, either one or more, should be authorised to determine those\ncases which the laws cannot particularly speak to, as it is impossible\nfor them, in general language, to explain themselves upon everything\nthat may arise: but what these laws are which are established upon the\nbest foundations has not been yet explained, but still remains a matter\nof some question: but the laws of every state will necessarily be like\nevery state, either trifling or excellent, just or unjust; for it is\nevident, that the laws must be framed correspondent to the constitution\nof the government; and, if so, it is plain, that a well-formed\ngovernment will have good laws, a bad one, bad ones.\nCHAPTER XII\nSince in every art and science the end aimed at is always good, so\nparticularly in this, which is the most excellent of all, the founding\nof civil society, the good wherein aimed at is justice; for it is this\nwhich is for the benefit of all. Now, it is the common opinion, that\njustice is a certain equality; and in this point all the philosophers\nare agreed when they treat of morals: for they say what is just, and to\nwhom; and that equals ought to receive equal: but we should know how\nwe are to determine what things are equal and what unequal; and in\nthis there is some difficulty, which calls for the philosophy of the\npolitician. Some persons will probably say, that the employments of the\nstate ought to be given according to every particular excellence of each\ncitizen, if there is no other difference between them and the rest of\nthe community, but they are in every respect else alike: for justice\nattributes different things to persons differing from each other in\ntheir character, according to their respective merits. But if this is\nadmitted to be true, complexion, or height, or any such advantage will\nbe a claim for a greater share of the public rights. But that this is\nevidently absurd is clear from other arts and sciences; for with respect\nto musicians who play on the flute together, the best flute is not given\nto him who is of the best family, for he will play never the better for\nthat, but the best instrument ought to be given to him who is the best\nartist.\nIf what is now said does not make this clear, we will explain it still\nfurther: if there should be any one, a very excellent player on the\nflute, but very deficient in family and beauty, though each of them are\nmore valuable endowments than a skill in music, and excel this art in a\nhigher degree than that player excels others, yet the best flutes ought\nto be given to him; for the superiority [1283a] in beauty and fortune\nshould have a reference to the business in hand; but these have none.\nMoreover, according to this reasoning, every possible excellence might\ncome in comparison with every other; for if bodily strength might\ndispute the point with riches or liberty, even any bodily strength might\ndo it; so that if one person excelled in size more than another did in\nvirtue, and his size was to qualify him to take place of the other's\nvirtue, everything must then admit of a comparison with each other; for\nif such a size is greater than virtue by so much, it is evident another\nmust be equal to it: but, since this is impossible, it is plain that it\nwould be contrary to common sense to dispute a right to any office in\nthe state from every superiority whatsoever: for if one person is slow\nand the other swift, neither is the one better qualified nor the other\nworse on that account, though in the gymnastic races a difference in\nthese particulars would gain the prize; but a pretension to the offices\nof the state should be founded on a superiority in those qualifications\nwhich are useful to it: for which reason those of family, independency,\nand fortune, with great propriety, contend with each other for them; for\nthese are the fit persons to fill them: for a city can no more consist\nof all poor men than it can of all slaves But if such persons are\nrequisite, it is evident that those also who are just and valiant are\nequally so; for without justice and valour no state can be supported,\nthe former being necessary for its existence, the latter for its\nhappiness.\nCHAPTER XIII\nIt seems, then, requisite for the establishment of a state, that all, or\nat least many of these particulars should be well canvassed and inquired\ninto; and that virtue and education may most justly claim the right of\nbeing considered as the necessary means of making the citizens happy, as\nwe have already said. As those who are equal in one particular are not\ntherefore equal in all, and those who are unequal in one particular\nare not therefore unequal in all, it follows that all those governments\nwhich are established upon a principle which supposes they are, are\nerroneous.\nWe have already said, that all the members of the community will dispute\nwith each other for the offices of the state; and in some particulars\njustly, but not so in general; the rich, for instance, because they\nhave the greatest landed property, and the ultimate right to the soil is\nvested in the community; and also because their fidelity is in general\nmost to be depended on. The freemen and men of family will dispute the\npoint with each other, as nearly on an equality; for these latter have\na right to a higher regard as citizens than obscure persons, for\nhonourable descent is everywhere of great esteem: nor is it an improper\nconclusion, that the descendants of men of worth will be men of worth\nthemselves; for noble birth is the fountain of virtue to men of family:\nfor the same reason also we justly say, that virtue has a right to put\nin her pretensions. Justice, for instance, is a virtue, and so necessary\nto society, that all others must yield her the precedence.\nLet us now see what the many have to urge on their side against the few;\nand they may say, that if, when collectively taken, they are compared\nwith them, they are stronger, richer, and better than they are. But\nshould it ever happen that all these should inhabit the [1283b] same\ncity, I mean the good, the rich, the noble, as well as the many, such as\nusually make up the community, I ask, will there then be any reason to\ndispute concerning who shall govern, or will there not? for in every\ncommunity which we have mentioned there is no dispute where the supreme\npower should be placed; for as these differ from each other, so do those\nin whom that is placed; for in one state the rich enjoy it, in others\nthe meritorious, and thus each according to their separate manners. Let\nus however consider what is to be done when all these happen at the same\ntime to inhabit the same city. If the virtuous should be very few in\nnumber, how then shall we act? shall we prefer the virtuous on account\nof their abilities, if they are capable of governing the city? or should\nthey be so many as almost entirely to compose the state?\nThere is also a doubt concerning the pretensions of all those who claim\nthe honours of government: for those who found them either on fortune or\nfamily have nothing which they can justly say in their defence; since\nit is evident upon their principle, that if any one person can be found\nricher than all the rest, the right of governing all these will be\njustly vested in this one person. In the same manner, one man who is\nof the best family will claim it from those who dispute the point upon\nfamily merit: and probably in an aristocracy the same dispute might\narise on the score of virtue, if there is one man better than all the\nother men of worth who are in the same community; it seems just, by the\nsame reasoning, that he should enjoy the supreme power. And upon this\nprinciple also, while the many suppose they ought to have the supreme\ncommand, as being more powerful than the few, if one or more than one,\nthough a small number should be found stronger than themselves, these\nought rather to have it than they.\nAll these things seem to make it plain, that none of these principles\nare justly founded on which these persons would establish their right to\nthe supreme power; and that all men whatsoever ought to obey them:\nfor with respect to those who claim it as due to their virtue or their\nfortune, they might have justly some objection to make; for nothing\nhinders but that it may sometimes happen, that the many may be better\nor richer than the few, not as individuals, but in their collective\ncapacity.\nAs to the doubt which some persons have proposed and objected, we may\nanswer it in this manner; it is this, whether a legislator, who would\nestablish the most perfect system of laws, should calculate them for\nthe use of the better part of the citizens, or the many, in the\ncircumstances we have already mentioned? The rectitude of anything\nconsists in its equality; that therefore which is equally right will be\nadvantageous to the whole state, and to every member of it in common.\nNow, in general, a citizen is one who both shares in the government and\nalso in his turn submits to be governed; [1284a] their condition, it is\ntrue, is different in different states: the best is that in which a man\nis enabled to choose and to persevere in a course of virtue during his\nwhole life, both in his public and private state. But should there be\none person, or a very few, eminent for an uncommon degree of virtue,\nthough not enough to make up a civil state, so that the virtue of the\nmany, or their political abilities, should be too inferior to come in\ncomparison with theirs, if more than one; or if but one, with his only;\nsuch are not to be considered as part of the city; for it would be doing\nthem injustice to rate them on a level with those who are so far their\ninferiors in virtue and political abilities, that they appear to them\nlike a god amongst men. From whence it is evident, that a system of laws\nmust be calculated for those who are equal to each other in nature and\npower. Such men, therefore, are not the object of law; for they are\nthemselves a law: and it would be ridiculous in any one to endeavour to\ninclude them in the penalties of a law: for probably they might say what\nAntisthenes tells us the lions did to the hares when they demanded to\nbe admitted to an equal share with them in the government. And it is on\nthis account that democratic states have established the ostracism; for\nan equality seems the principal object of their government. For which\nreason they compel all those who are very eminent for their power, their\nfortune, their friendships, or any other cause which may give them too\ngreat weight in the government, to submit to the ostracism, and leave\nthe city for a stated time; as the fabulous histories relate the\nArgonauts served Hercules, for they refused to take him with them in the\nship Argo on account of his superior valour. For which reason those who\nhate a tyranny and find fault with the advice which Periander gave to\nThrasybulus, must not think there was nothing to be said in its defence;\nfor the story goes, that Periander said nothing to the messenger in\nanswer to the business he was consulted about, but striking off those\nears of corn which were higher than the rest, reduced the whole crop to\na level; so that the messenger, without knowing the cause of what was\ndone, related the fact to Thrasybulus, who understood by it that he must\ntake off all the principal men in the city. Nor is this serviceable to\ntyrants only; nor is it tyrants only who do it; for the same thing is\npractised both in oligarchies and democracies: for the ostracism has in\na manner nearly the same power, by restraining and banishing those who\nare too great; and what is done in one city is done also by those who\nhave the supreme power in separate states; as the Athenians with respect\nto the Samians, the Chians, and the Lesbians; for when they suddenly\nacquired the superiority over all Greece, they brought the other states\ninto subjection, contrary to the treaties which subsisted between them.\nThe King of Persia also very often reduces the Medes and Babylonians\nwhen they assume upon their former power: [1284b] and this is a\nprinciple which all governments whatsoever keep in their eye; even those\nwhich are best administered, as well as those which are not, do it;\nthese for the sake of private utility, the others for the public good.\nThe same thing is to be perceived in the other arts and sciences; for\na painter would not represent an animal with a foot disproportionally\nlarge, though he had drawn it remarkably beautiful; nor would the\nshipwright make the prow or any other part of the vessel larger than it\nought to be; nor will the master of the band permit any who sings\nlouder and better than the rest to sing in concert with them. There is\ntherefore no reason that a monarch should not act in agreement with\nfree states, to support his own power, if they do the same thing for the\nbenefit of their respective communities; upon which account when there\nis any acknowledged difference in the power of the citizens, the reason\nupon which the ostracism is founded will be politically just; but it is\nbetter for the legislator so to establish his state at the beginning as\nnot to want this remedy: but if in course of time such an inconvenience\nshould arise, to endeavour to amend it by some such correction. Not that\nthis was the use it was put to: for many did not regard the benefit of\ntheir respective communities, but made the ostracism a weapon in the\nhand of sedition.\nIt is evident, then, that in corrupt governments it is partly just and\nuseful to the individual, though probably it is as clear that it is not\nentirely just: for in a well-governed state there may be great doubts\nabout the use of it, not on account of the pre-eminence which one may\nhave in strength, riches, or connection: but when the pre-eminence is\nvirtue, what then is to be done? for it seems not right to turn out and\nbanish such a one; neither does it seem right to govern him, for that\nwould be like desiring to share the power with Jupiter and to govern\nhim: nothing then remains but what indeed seems natural, and that is for\nall persons quietly to submit to the government of those who are thus\neminently virtuous, and let them be perpetually kings in the separate\nstates.\nCHAPTER XIV\nWhat has been now said, it seems proper to change our subject and to\ninquire into the nature of monarchies; for we have already admitted them\nto be one of those species of government which are properly founded. And\nhere let us consider whether a kingly government is proper for a city or\na country whose principal object is the happiness of the inhabitants,\nor rather some other. But let us first determine whether this is of one\nkind only, or more; [1285a] and it is easy to know that it consists of\nmany different species, and that the forms of government are not the\nsame in all: for at Sparta the kingly power seems chiefly regulated by\nthe laws; for it is not supreme in all circumstances; but when the king\nquits the territories of the state he is their general in war; and all\nreligious affairs are entrusted to him: indeed the kingly power with\nthem is chiefly that of a general who cannot be called to an account for\nhis conduct, and whose command is for life: for he has not the power\nof life and death, except as a general; as they frequently had in\ntheir expeditions by martial law, which we learn from Homer; for when\nAgamemnon is affronted in council, he restrains his resentment, but when\nhe is in the field and armed with this power, he tells the Greeks:\n\"Whoe'er I know shall shun th' impending fight,\nTo dogs and vultures soon shall be a prey; For death is mine....\"\nThis, then, is one species of monarchical government in which the kingly\npower is in a general for life; and is sometimes hereditary, sometimes\nelective: besides, there is also another, which is to be met with among\nsome of the barbarians, in which the kings are invested with powers\nnearly equal to a tyranny, yet are, in some respects, bound by the laws\nand the customs of their country; for as the barbarians are by nature\nmore prone to slavery than the Greeks, and those in Asia more than those\nin Europe, they endure without murmuring a despotic government; for\nthis reason their governments are tyrannies; but yet not liable to be\noverthrown, as being customary and according to law. Their guards also\nare such as are used in a kingly government, not a despotic one; for the\nguards of their kings are his citizens, but a tyrant's are foreigners.\nThe one commands, in the manner the law directs, those who willingly\nobey; the other, arbitrarily, those who consent not. The one, therefore,\nis guarded by the citizens, the other against them.\nThese, then, are the two different sorts of these monarchies, and\nanother is that which in ancient Greece they called _aesumnetes_; which\nis nothing more than an elective tyranny; and its difference from that\nwhich is to be found amongst the barbarians consists not in its not\nbeing according to law, but only in its not being according to the\nancient customs of the country. Some persons possessed this power for\nlife, others only for a particular time or particular purpose, as the\npeople of Mitylene elected Pittacus to oppose the exiles, who were\nheaded by Antimenides and Alcaeus the poet, as we learn from a poem\nof his; for he upbraids the Mitylenians for having chosen Pittacus for\ntheir tyrant, and with one [1285b] voice extolling him to the skies who\nwas the ruin of a rash and devoted people. These sorts of government\nthen are, and ever were, despotic, on account of their being tyrannies;\nbut inasmuch as they are elective, and over a free people, they are also\nkingly.\nA fourth species of kingly government is that which was in use in the\nheroic times, when a free people submitted to a kingly government,\naccording to the laws and customs of their country. For those who were\nat first of benefit to mankind, either in arts or arms, or by collecting\nthem into civil society, or procuring them an establishment, became the\nkings of a willing people, and established an hereditary monarchy.\nThey were particularly their generals in war, and presided over their\nsacrifices, excepting such only as belonged to the priests: they were\nalso the supreme judges over the people; and in this case some of them\ntook an oath, others did not; they did, the form of swearing was by\ntheir sceptre held out.\nIn ancient times the power of the kings extended to everything\nwhatsoever, both civil, domestic, and foreign; but in after-times they\nrelinquished some of their privileges, and others the people assumed, so\nthat, in some states, they left their kings only the right of presiding\nover the sacrifices; and even those whom it were worth while to call\nby that name had only the right of being commander-in-chief in their\nforeign wars.\nThese, then, are the four sorts of kingdoms: the first is that of the\nheroic times; which was a government over a free people, with its rights\nin some particulars marked out; for the king was their general, their\njudge, and their high priest. The second, that of the barbarians; which\nis an hereditary despotic government regulated by laws: the third is\nthat which they call aesumnetic, which is an elective tyranny. The\nfourth is the Lacedaemonian; and this, in few words, is nothing more\nthan an hereditary generalship: and in these particulars they differ\nfrom each other. There is a fifth species of kingly government, which is\nwhen one person has a supreme power over all things whatsoever, in\nthe manner that every state and every city has over those things which\nbelong to the public: for as the master of a family is king in his own\nhouse, so such a king is master of a family in his own city or state.\nCHAPTER XV\nBut the different sorts of kingly governments may, if I may so say,\nbe reduced to two; which we will consider more particularly. The last\nspoken of, and the Lacedaemonian, for the chief of the others are placed\nbetween these, which are as it were at the extremities, they having less\npower than an absolute government, and yet more than the Lacedaemonians;\nso that the whole matter in question may be reduced to these two points;\nthe one is, whether it is advantageous to the citizens to have the\noffice of general continue in one person for life, and whether it should\nbe confined to any particular families or whether every one should be\neligible: the other, whether [1286a] it is advantageous for one person\nto have the supreme power over everything or not. But to enter into the\nparticulars concerning the office of a Lacedaemonian general would be\nrather to frame laws for a state than to consider the nature and utility\nof its constitution, since we know that the appointing of a general is\nwhat is done in every state. Passing over this question then, we will\nproceed to consider the other part of their government, which is\nthe polity of the state; and this it will be necessary to examine\nparticularly into, and to go through such questions as may arise.\nNow the first thing which presents itself to our consideration is this,\nwhether it is best to be governed by a good man, or by good laws? Those\nwho prefer a kingly government think that laws can only speak a general\nlanguage, but cannot adapt themselves to particular circumstances; for\nwhich reason it is absurd in any science to follow written rule; and\neven in Egypt the physician was allowed to alter the mode of cure which\nthe law prescribed to him, after the fourth day; but if he did it sooner\nit was at his own peril: from whence it is evident, on the very same\naccount, that a government of written laws is not the best; and yet\ngeneral reasoning is necessary to all those who are to govern, and it\nwill be much more perfect in those who are entirely free from passions\nthan in those to whom they are natural. But now this is a quality which\nlaws possess; while the other is natural to the human soul. But some\none will say in answer to this, that man will be a better judge of\nparticulars. It will be necessary, then, for a king to be a lawgiver,\nand that his laws should be published, but that those should have no\nauthority which are absurd, as those which are not, should. But whether\nis it better for the community that those things which cannot possibly\ncome under the cognisance of the law either at all or properly should be\nunder the government of every worthy citizen, as the present method is,\nwhen the public community, in their general assemblies, act as judges\nand counsellors, where all their determinations are upon particular\ncases, for one individual, be he who he will, will be found, upon\ncomparison, inferior to a whole people taken collectively: but this\nis what a city is, as a public entertainment is better than one man's\nportion: for this reason the multitude judge of many things better than\nany one single person. They are also less liable to corruption from\ntheir numbers, as water is from its quantity: besides, the judgment of\nan individual must necessarily be perverted if he is overcome by anger\nor any other passion; but it would be hard indeed if the whole community\nshould be misled by anger. Moreover, let the people be free, and they\nwill do nothing but in conformity to the law, except only in those cases\nwhich the law cannot speak to. But though what I am going to propose may\nnot easily be met with, yet if the majority of the state should happen\nto be good men, should they prefer one uncorrupt governor or many\nequally good, is it not evident that they should choose the many? But\nthere may be divisions among [1286b] these which cannot happen when\nthere is but one. In answer to this it may be replied that all their\nsouls will be as much animated with virtue as this one man's.\nIf then a government of many, and all of them good men, compose an\naristocracy, and the government of one a kingly power, it is evident\nthat the people should rather choose the first than the last; and this\nwhether the state is powerful or not, if many such persons so alike\ncan be met with: and for this reason probable it was, that the first\ngovernments were generally monarchies; because it was difficult to find\na number of persons eminently virtuous, more particularly as the world\nwas then divided into small communities; besides, kings were appointed\nin return for the benefits they had conferred on mankind; but such\nactions are peculiar to good men: but when many persons equal in virtue\nappeared at the time, they brooked not a superiority, but sought after\nan equality and established a free state; but after this, when they\ndegenerated, they made a property of the public; which probably gave\nrise to oligarchies; for they made wealth meritorious, and the honours\nof government were reserved for the rich: and these afterwards turned\nto tyrannies and these in their turn gave rise to democracies; for\nthe power of the tyrants continually decreasing, on account of their\nrapacious avarice, the people grew powerful enough to frame and\nestablish democracies: and as cities after that happened to increase,\nprobably it was not easy for them to be under any other government than\na democracy. But if any person prefers a kingly government in a state,\nwhat is to be done with the king's children? Is the family also to\nreign? But should they have such children as some persons usually have,\nit will be very detrimental. It may be said, that then the king who\nhas it in his power will never permit such children to succeed to his\nkingdom. But it is not easy to trust to that; for it is very hard and\nrequires greater virtue than is to be met with in human nature. There is\nalso a doubt concerning the power with which a king should be entrusted:\nwhether he should be allowed force sufficient to compel those who do\nnot choose to be obedient to the laws, and how he is to support his\ngovernment? for if he is to govern according to law and do nothing of\nhis own will which is contrary thereunto, at the same time it will\nbe necessary to protect that power with which he guards the law, This\nmatter however may not be very difficult to determine; for he ought to\nhave a proper power, and such a one is that which will be sufficient\nto make the king superior to any one person or even a large part of the\ncommunity, but inferior to the whole, as the ancients always appointed\nguards for that person whom they created aesumnetes or tyrant; and some\none advised the Syracusians, when Dionysius asked for guards, to allow\nhim such.\nCHAPTER XVI\n[1287a] We will next consider the absolute monarch that we have just\nmentioned, who does everything according to his own will: for a king\ngoverning under the direction of laws which he is obliged to follow does\nnot of himself create any particular species of government, as we have\nalready said: for in every state whatsoever, either aristocracy or\ndemocracy, it is easy to appoint a general for life; and there are many\nwho entrust the administration of affairs to one person only; such is\nthe government at Dyrrachium, and nearly the same at Opus. As for an\nabsolute monarchy as it is called, that is to say, when the whole state\nis wholly subject to the will of one person, namely the king, it seems\nto many that it is unnatural that one man should have the entire rule\nover his fellow-citizens when the state consists of equals: for nature\nrequires that the same right and the same rank should necessarily take\nplace amongst all those who are equal by nature: for as it would be\nhurtful to the body for those who are of different constitutions to\nobserve the same regimen, either of diet or clothing, so is it with\nrespect to the honours of the state as hurtful, that those who are equal\nin merit should be unequal in rank; for which reason it is as much\na man's duty to submit to command as to assume it, and this also by\nrotation; for this is law, for order is law; and it is more proper that\nlaw should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle,\nif it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular\npersons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants\nof the laws, for the supreme power must be placed somewhere; but they\nsay, that it is unjust that where all are equal one person should\ncontinually enjoy it. But it seems unlikely that man should be able to\nadjust that which the law cannot determine; it may be replied, that the\nlaw having laid down the best rules possible, leaves the adjustment and\napplication of particulars to the discretion of the magistrate; besides,\nit allows anything to be altered which experience proves may be better\nestablished. Moreover, he who would place the supreme power in mind,\nwould place it in God and the laws; but he who entrusts man with it,\ngives it to a wild beast, for such his appetites sometimes make him; for\npassion influences those who are in power, even the very best of men:\nfor which reason law is reason without desire.\nThe instance taken from the arts seems fallacious: wherein it is said to\nbe wrong for a sick person to apply for a remedy to books, but that it\nwould be far more eligible to employ those who are skilful in physic;\nfor these do nothing contrary to reason from motives of friendship\nbut earn their money by curing the sick, whereas those who have the\nmanagement of public affairs do many things through hatred or favour.\nAnd, as a proof of what we have advanced, it may be observed, that\nwhenever a sick person suspects that his physician has been persuaded by\nhis enemies to be guilty of any foul practice to him in his profession,\nhe then rather chooses to apply to books for his cure: and not only this\n[1287b] but even physicians themselves when they are ill call in other\nphysicians: and those who teach others the gymnastic exercises,\nexercise with those of the same profession, as being incapable from\nself-partiality to form a proper judgment of what concerns themselves.\nFrom whence it is evident, that those who seek for what is just, seek\nfor a mean; now law is a mean. Moreover; the moral law is far superior\nand conversant with far superior objects than the written law; for the\nsupreme magistrate is safer to be trusted to than the one, though he is\ninferior to the other. But as it is impossible that one person should\nhave an eye to everything himself, it will be necessary that the supreme\nmagistrate should employ several subordinate ones under him; why then\nshould not this be done at first, instead of appointing one person in\nthis manner? Besides, if, according to what has been already said, the\nman of worth is on that account fit to govern, two men of worth are\ncertainly better than one: as, for instance, in Homer, \"Let two together\ngo:\" and also Agamemnon's wish; \"Were ten such faithful counsel mine!\"\nNot but that there are even now some particular magistrates invested\nwith supreme power to decide, as judges, those things which the law\ncannot, as being one of those cases which comes not properly under its\njurisdiction; for of those which can there is no doubt: since then laws\ncomprehend some things, but not all, it is necessary to enquire and\nconsider which of the two is preferable, that the best man or the best\nlaw should govern; for to reduce every subject which can come under the\ndeliberation of man into a law is impossible.\nNo one then denies, that it is necessary that there should be some\nperson to decide those cases which cannot come under the cognisance of\na written law: but we say, that it is better to have many than one;\nfor though every one who decides according to the principles of the law\ndecides justly; yet surely it seems absurd to suppose, that one person\ncan see better with two eyes, and hear better with two ears, or do\nbetter with two hands and two feet, than many can do with many: for we\nsee that absolute monarchs now furnish themselves with many eyes and\nears and hands and feet; for they entrust those who are friends to\nthem and their government with part of their power; for if they are not\nfriends to the monarch, they will not do what he chooses; but if they\nare friends to him, they are friends also to his government: but a\nfriend is an equal and like his friend: if then he thinks that such\nshould govern, he thinks that his equal also should govern. These are\nnearly the objections which are usually made to a kingly power.\nCHAPTER XVII\nProbably what we have said may be true of some persons, but not of\nothers; for some men are by nature formed to be under the government of\na master; others, of a king; others, to be the citizens of a free state,\njust and useful; but a tyranny is not according to nature, nor the other\nperverted forms of government; for they are contrary to it. But it\nis evident from what has been said, that among equals it is neither\nadvantageous nor [1288a] right that one person should be lord over all\nwhere there are no established laws, but his will is the law; or where\nthere are; nor is it right that one who is good should have it over\nthose who are good; or one who is not good over those who are not good;\nnor one who is superior to the rest in worth, except in a particular\nmanner, which shall be described, though indeed it has been already\nmentioned. But let us next determine what people are best qualified\nfor a kingly government, what for an aristocratic, and what for a\ndemocratic. And, first, for a kingly; and it should be those who are\naccustomed by nature to submit the civil government of themselves to a\nfamily eminent for virtue: for an aristocracy, those who are naturally\nframed to bear the rule of free men, whose superior virtue makes them\nworthy of the management of others: for a free state, a war-like people,\nformed by nature both to govern and be governed by laws which admit the\npoorest citizen to share the honours of the commonwealth according\nto his worth. But whenever a whole family or any one of another shall\nhappen so far to excel in virtue as to exceed all other persons in the\ncommunity, then it is right that the kingly power should be in them, or\nif it is an individual who does so, that he should be king and lord of\nall; for this, as we have just mentioned, is not only correspondent\nto that principle of right which all founders of all states, whether\naristocracies, oligarchies, or democracies, have a regard to (for\nin placing the supreme power they all think it right to fix it to\nexcellence, though not the same); but it is also agreeable to what\nhas been already said; as it would not be right to kill, or banish, or\nostracise such a one for his superior merit. Nor would it be proper\nto let him have the supreme power only in turn; for it is contrary to\nnature that what is highest should ever be lowest: but this would be\nthe case should such a one ever be governed by others. So that there can\nnothing else be done but to submit, and permit him continually to\nenjoy the supreme power. And thus much with respect to kingly power in\ndifferent states, and whether it is or is not advantageous to them, and\nto what, and in what manner.\nCHAPTER XVIII\nSince then we have said that there are three sorts of regular\ngovernments, and of these the best must necessarily be that which is\nadministered by the best men (and this must be that which happens to\nhave one man, or one family, or a number of persons excelling all the\nrest in virtue, who are able to govern and be governed in such a manner\nas will make life most agreeable, and we have already shown that the\nvirtue of a good man and of a citizen in the most perfect government\nwill be the same), it is evident, that in the same manner, and for those\nvery qualities which would procure a man the character of good, any\none would say, that the government of a state was a well-established\naristocracy or kingdom; so that it will be found to be education and\n[1288b] morals that are almost the whole which go to make a good man,\nand the same qualities will make a good citizen or good king.\nThese particulars being treated of, we will now proceed to consider\nwhat sort of government is best, how it naturally arises, and how it\nis established; for it is necessary to make a proper inquiry concerning\nthis.\nBOOK IV\nCHAPTER I\nIn every art and science which is not conversant in parts but in some\none genus in which it is complete, it is the business of that art alone\nto determine what is fitted to its particular genus; as what particular\nexercise is fitted to a certain particular body, and suits it best: for\nthat body which is formed by nature the most perfect and superior to\nothers necessarily requires the best exercise-and also of what one kind\nthat must be which will suit the generality; and this is the business of\nthe gymnastic arts: and although any one should not desire to acquire\nan exact knowledge and skill in these exercises, yet it is not, on that\naccount, the less necessary that he who professes to be a master and\ninstruct the youth in them should be perfect therein: and we see that\nthis is what equally befalls the healing, shipbuilding, cloth-making,\nand indeed all other arts; so that it evidently belongs to the same art\nto find out what kind of government is best, and would of all others be\nmost correspondent to our wish, while it received no molestation from\nwithout: and what particular species of it is adapted to particular\npersons; for there are many who probably are incapable of enjoying the\nbest form: so that the legislator, and he who is truly a politician,\nought to be acquainted not only with that which is most perfect\nimaginable, but also that which is the best suited to any given\ncircumstances. There is, moreover, a third sort, an imaginary one, and\nhe ought, if such a one should be presented to his consideration, to be\nable to discern what sort of one it would be at the beginning; and, when\nonce established, what would be the proper means to preserve it a long\ntime. I mean, for instance, if a state should happen not to have the\nbest form of government, or be deficient in what was necessary, or not\nreceive every advantage possible, but something less. And, besides all\nthis, it is necessary to know what sort of government is best fitting\nfor all cities: for most of those writers who have treated this subject,\nhowever speciously they may handle other parts of it, have failed in\ndescribing the practical parts: for it is not enough to be able to\nperceive what is best without it is what can be put in practice. It\nshould also be simple, and easy for all to attain to. But some seek only\nthe most subtile forms of government. Others again, choosing [1289a]\nrather to treat of what is common, censure those under which they live,\nand extol the excellence of a particular state, as the Lacedaemonian,\nor some other: but every legislator ought to establish such a form of\ngovernment as from the present state and disposition of the people who\nare to receive it they will most readily submit to and persuade the\ncommunity to partake of: for it is not a business of less trouble to\ncorrect the mistakes of an established government than to form a new\none; as it is as difficult to recover what we have forgot as to learn\nanything afresh. He, therefore, who aspires to the character of a\nlegislator, ought, besides all we have already said, to be able to\ncorrect the mistakes of a government already established, as we have\nbefore mentioned. But this is impossible to be done by him who does\nnot know how many different forms of government there are: some persons\nthink that there is only one species both of democracy and oligarchy;\nbut this is not true: so that every one should be acquainted with the\ndifference of these governments, how great they are, and whence they\narise; and should have equal knowledge to perceive what laws are best,\nand what are most suitable to each particular government: for all\nlaws are, and ought to be, framed agreeable to the state that is to be\ngoverned by them, and not the state to the laws: for government is a\ncertain ordering in a state which particularly respects the magistrates\nin what manner they shall be regulated, and where the supreme power\nshall be placed; and what shall be the final object which each community\nshall have in view; but the laws are something different from what\nregulates and expresses the form of the constitution-it is their office\nto direct the conduct of the magistrate in the execution of his office\nand the punishment of offenders. From whence it is evident, that the\nfounders of laws should attend both to the number and the different\nsorts of government; for it is impossible that the same laws should be\ncalculated for all sorts of oligarchies and all sorts of democracies,\nfor of both these governments there are many species, not one only.\nCHAPTER II\nSince, then, according to our first method in treating of the different\nforms of government, we have divided those which are regular into three\nsorts, the kingly, the aristocratical, the free states, and shown\nthe three excesses which these are liable to: the kingly, of becoming\ntyrannical; the aristocratical, oligarchical; and the free state,\ndemocratical: and as we have already treated of the aristocratical and\nkingly; for to enter into an inquiry what sort of government is best\nis the same thing as to treat of these two expressly; for each of\nthem desires to be established upon the principles of virtue: and as,\nmoreover, we have already determined wherein a kingly power and an\naristocracy differ from each other, and when a state may be said to be\ngoverned by a king, it now remains that we examine into a free state,\nand also these other governments, an oligarchy, a democracy, and a\n[1289b] tyranny; and it is evident of these three excesses which must be\nthe worst of all, and which next to it; for, of course, the excesses of\nthe best and most holy must be the worst; for it must necessarily happen\neither that the name of king only will remain, or else that the king\nwill assume more power than belongs to him, from whence tyranny will\narise, the worst excess imaginable, a government the most contrary\npossible to a free state. The excess next hurtful is an oligarchy; for\nan aristocracy differs much from this sort of government: that which is\nleast so is a democracy. This subject has been already treated of by one\nof those writers who have gone before me, though his sentiments are not\nthe same as mine: for he thought, that of all excellent constitutions,\nas a good oligarchy or the like, a democracy was the worst, but of all\nbad ones, the best.\nNow I affirm, that all these states have, without exception, fallen into\nexcess; and also that he should not have said that one oligarchy was\nbetter than another, but that it was not quite so bad. But this question\nwe shall not enter into at present. We shall first inquire how many\ndifferent sorts of free states there are; since there are many\nspecies of democracies and oligarchies; and which of them is the most\ncomprehensive, and most desirable after the best form of government; or\nif there is any other like an aristocracy, well established; and also\nwhich of these is best adapted to most cities, and which of them is\npreferable for particular persons: for, probably, some may suit better\nwith an oligarchy than a democracy, and others better with a democracy\nthan an oligarchy; and afterwards in what manner any one ought to\nproceed who desires to establish either of these states, I mean every\nspecies of democracy, and also of oligarchy. And to conclude, when we\nshall have briefly gone through everything that is necessary, we will\nendeavour to point out the sources of corruption, and stability, in\ngovernment, as well those which are common to all as those which are\npeculiar to each state, and from what causes they chiefly arise.\nCHAPTER III\nThe reason for there being many different sorts of governments is this,\nthat each state consists of a great number of parts; for, in the first\nplace, we see that all cities are made up of families: and again, of\nthe multitude of these some must be rich, some poor, and others in the\nmiddle station; and that, both of the rich and poor, some will be used\nto arms, others not. We see also, that some of the common people are\nhusbandmen, others attend the market, and others are artificers. There\nis also a difference between the nobles in their wealth, and the dignity\nin which they live: for instance, in the number of horses they breed;\nfor this cannot be supported without a large fortune: for which reason,\nin former times, those cities whose strength consisted in horse became\nby that means oligarchies; and they used horse in their expeditions\nagainst the neighbouring cities; as the Eretrians the Chalcidians, the\nMagnetians, who lived near the river Meander, and many others in Asia.\nMoreover, besides the difference of fortune, there is that which arises\nfrom family and merit; or, if there are any other distinctions [1290a]\nwhich make part of the city, they have been already mentioned in\ntreating of an aristocracy, for there we considered how many parts each\ncity must necessarily be composed of; and sometimes each of these have a\nshare in the government, sometimes a few, sometimes more.\nIt is evident then, that there must be many forms of government,\ndiffering from each other in their particular constitution: for the\nparts of which they are composed each differ from the other. For\ngovernment is the ordering of the magistracies of the state; and these\nthe community share between themselves, either as they can attain them\nby force, or according to some common equality which there is amongst\nthem, as poverty, wealth, or something which they both partake of. There\nmust therefore necessarily be as many different forms of governments as\nthere are different ranks in the society, arising from the superiority\nof some over others, and their different situations. And these seem\nchiefly to be two, as they say, of the winds: namely, the north and\nthe south; and all the others are declinations from these. And thus in\npolitics, there is the government of the many and the government of\nthe few; or a democracy and an oligarchy: for an aristocracy may be\nconsidered as a species of oligarchy, as being also a government of the\nfew; and what we call a free state may be considered as a democracy: as\nin the winds they consider the west as part of the north, and the east\nas part of the south: and thus it is in music, according to some, who\nsay there are only two species of it, the Doric and the Phrygian, and\nall other species of composition they call after one of these names; and\nmany people are accustomed to consider the nature of government in the\nsame light; but it is both more convenient and more correspondent to\ntruth to distinguish governments as I have done, into two species: one,\nof those which are established upon proper principles; of which there\nmay be one or two sorts: the other, which includes all the different\nexcesses of these; so that we may compare the best form of government to\nthe most harmonious piece of music; the oligarchic and despotic to the\nmore violent tunes; and the democratic to the soft and gentle airs.\nCHAPTER IV\nWe ought not to define a democracy as some do, who say simply, that it\nis a government where the supreme power is lodged in the people; for\neven in oligarchies the supreme power is in the majority. Nor should\nthey define an oligarchy a government where the supreme power is in the\nhands of a few: for let us suppose the number of a people to be thirteen\nhundred, and that of these one thousand were rich, who would not permit\nthe three hundred poor to have any share in the government, although\nthey were free, and their equal in everything else; no one would say,\nthat this government was a democracy. In like manner, if the poor, when\nfew in number, should acquire the power over the rich, though more than\nthemselves, no one would say, that this was an oligarchy; nor this, when\nthe rest who are rich have no share in the administration. We should\nrather say, that a democracy is when the supreme power is in the [1290b]\nhands of the freemen; an oligarchy, when it is in the hands of the rich:\nit happens indeed that in the one case the many will possess it, in\nthe other the few; because there are many poor and few rich. And if the\npower of the state was to be distributed according to the size of the\ncitizens, as they say it is in Ethiopia, or according to their beauty,\nit would be an oligarchy: for the number of those who are large and\nbeautiful is small.\nNor are those things which we have already mentioned alone sufficient\nto describe these states; for since there are many species both of a\ndemocracy and an oligarchy, the matter requires further consideration;\nas we cannot admit, that if a few persons who are free possess the\nsupreme power over the many who are not free, that this government is a\ndemocracy: as in Apollonia, in Ionia, and in Thera: for in each of these\ncities the honours of the state belong to some few particular families,\nwho first founded the colonies. Nor would the rich, because they are\nsuperior in numbers, form a democracy, as formerly at Colophon; for\nthere the majority had large possessions before the Lydian war: but a\ndemocracy is a state where the freemen and the poor, being the majority,\nare invested with the power of the state. An oligarchy is a state where\nthe rich and those of noble families, being few, possess it.\nWe have now proved that there are various forms of government and have\nassigned a reason for it; and shall proceed to show that there are\neven more than these, and what they are, and why; setting out with the\nprinciple we have already laid down. We admit that every city consists\nnot of one, but many parts: thus, if we should endeavour to comprehend\nthe different species of animals we should first of all note those parts\nwhich every animal must have, as a certain sensorium, and also what is\nnecessary to acquire and retain food, as a mouth and a belly; besides\ncertain parts to enable it to move from place to place. If, then, these\nare the only parts of an animal and there are differences between them;\nnamely, in their various sorts of stomachs, bellies, and sensoriums: to\nwhich we must add their motive powers; the number of the combinations of\nall these must necessarily make up the different species of animals.\nFor it is not possible that the same kind of animal should have any\nvery great difference in its mouth or ears; so that when all these are\ncollected, who happen to have these things similar in all, they make up\na species of animals of which there are as many as there are of these\ngeneral combinations of necessary parts.\nThe same thing is true of what are called states; for a city is not made\nof one but many parts, as has already been often said; one of which is\nthose who supply it with provisions, called husbandmen, another called\nmechanics, [1291a] whose employment is in the manual arts, without which\nthe city could not be inhabited; of these some are busied about what is\nabsolutely necessary, others in what contribute to the elegancies and\npleasures of life; the third sort are your exchange-men, I mean by these\nyour buyers, sellers, merchants, and victuallers; the fourth are your\nhired labourers or workmen; the fifth are the men-at-arms, a rank not\nless useful than the other, without you would have the community slaves\nto every invader; but what cannot defend itself is unworthy of the name\nof a city; for a city is self-sufficient, a slave not. So that when\nSocrates, in Plato's Republic, says that a city is necessarily composed\nof four sorts of people, he speaks elegantly but not correctly, and\nthese are, according to him, weavers, husbandmen, shoe-makers, and\nbuilders; he then adds, as if these were not sufficient, smiths,\nherdsmen for what cattle are necessary, and also merchants and\nvictuallers, and these are by way of appendix to his first list; as if\na city was established for necessity, and not happiness, or as if a\nshoe-maker and a husbandman were equally useful. He reckons not the\nmilitary a part before the increase of territory and joining to the\nborders of the neighbouring powers will make war necessary: and even\namongst them who compose his four divisions, or whoever have any\nconnection with each other, it will be necessary to have some one to\ndistribute justice, and determine between man and man. If, then, the\nmind is a more valuable part of man than the body, every one would\nwish to have those things more regarded in his city which tend to the\nadvantage of these than common matters, such are war and justice; to\nwhich may be added council, which is the business of civil wisdom (nor\nis it of any consequence whether these different employments are filled\nby different persons or one, as the same man is oftentimes both a\nsoldier and a husbandman): so that if both the judge and the senator are\nparts of the city, it necessarily follows that the soldier must be\nso also. The seventh sort are those who serve the public in expensive\nemployments at their own charge: these are called the rich. The eighth\nare those who execute the different offices of the state, and without\nthese it could not possibly subsist: it is therefore necessary that\nthere should be some persons capable of governing and filling the places\nin the city; and this either for life or in rotation: the office of\nsenator, and judge, of which we have already sufficiently treated, are\nthe only ones remaining. If, then, these things are necessary for a\nstate, that it may be happy and just, it follows that the citizens who\nengage in public affairs should be men of abilities therein. [1291b]\nSeveral persons think, that different employments may be allotted to the\nsame person; as a soldier's, a husbandman's, and an artificer's; as also\nthat others may be both senators and judges.\nBesides, every one supposes himself a man of political abilities, and\nthat he is qualified for almost every department in the state. But the\nsame person cannot at once be poor and rich: for which reason the most\nobvious division of the city is into two parts, the poor and rich;\nmoreover, since for the generality the one are few, the other many, they\nseem of all the parts of a city most contrary to each other; so that as\nthe one or the other prevail they form different states; and these are\nthe democracy and the oligarchy.\nBut that there are many different states, and from what causes they\narise, has been already mentioned: and that there are also different\nspecies both of democracies and oligarchies we will now show. Though\nthis indeed is evident from what we have already said: there are also\nmany different sorts of common people, and also of those who are\ncalled gentlemen. Of the different sorts of the first are husbandmen,\nartificers, exchange-men, who are employed in buying and selling,\nseamen, of which some are engaged in war, some in traffic, some in\ncarrying goods and passengers from place to place, others in fishing,\nand of each of these there are often many, as fishermen at Tarentum and\nByzantium, masters of galleys at Athens, merchants at AEgina and Chios,\nthose who let ships on freight at Tenedos; we may add to these those who\nlive by their manual labour and have but little property; so that they\ncannot live without some employ: and also those who are not free-born\non both sides, and whatever other sort of common people there may be.\nAs for gentlemen, they are such as are distinguished either by their\nfortune, their birth, their abilities, or their education, or any\nsuch-like excellence which is attributed to them.\nThe most pure democracy is that which is so called principally from that\nequality which prevails in it: for this is what the law in that state\ndirects; that the poor shall be in no greater subjection than the rich;\nnor that the supreme power shall be lodged with either of these, but\nthat both shall share it. For if liberty and equality, as some persons\nsuppose, are chiefly to be found in a democracy, it must be most so\nby every department of government being alike open to all; but as the\npeople are the majority, and what they vote is law, it follows that such\na state must be a democracy. This, then, is one species thereof. Another\nis, when the magistrates are elected by a certain census; but this\nshould be but small, and every one who was included in it should be\neligible, but as soon as he was below it should lose that right. [1292a]\nAnother sort is, in which every citizen who is not infamous has a share\nin the government, but where the government is in the laws. Another,\nwhere every citizen without exception has this right. Another is like\nthese in other particulars, but there the people govern, and not the\nlaw: and this takes place when everything is determined by a majority of\nvotes, and not by a law; which happens when the people are influenced by\nthe demagogues: for where a democracy is governed by stated laws there\nis no room for them, but men of worth fill the first offices in the\nstate: but where the power is not vested in the laws, there demagogues\nabound: for there the people rule with kingly power: the whole composing\none body; for they are supreme, not as individuals but in their\ncollective capacity.\nHomer also discommends the government of many; but whether he means this\nwe are speaking of, or where each person exercises his power separately,\nis uncertain. When the people possess this power they desire to be\naltogether absolute, that they may not be under the control of the law,\nand this is the time when flatterers are held in repute. Nor is there\nany difference between such a people and monarchs in a tyranny: for\ntheir manners are the same, and they both hold a despotic power over\nbetter persons than themselves. For their decrees are like the others'\nedicts; their demagogues like the others' flatterers: but their greatest\nresemblance consists in the mutual support they give to each other, the\nflatterer to the tyrant, the demagogue to the people: and to them it is\nowing that the supreme power is lodged in the votes of the people,\nand not in the laws; for they bring everything before them, as their\ninfluence is owing to their being supreme whose opinions they entirely\ndirect; for these are they whom the multitude obey. Besides, those who\naccuse the magistrates insist upon it, that the right of determining on\ntheir conduct lies in the people, who gladly receive their complaints as\nthe means of destroying all their offices.\nAny one, therefore, may with great justice blame such a government as\nbeing a democracy, and not a free state; for where the government is\nnot in the laws, then there is no free state, for the law ought to be\nsupreme over all things; and particular incidents which arise should be\ndetermined by the magistrates or the state. If, therefore, a\ndemocracy is to be reckoned a free state, it is evident that any such\nestablishment which centres all power in the votes of the people cannot,\nproperly speaking, be a democracy: for their decrees cannot be general\nin their extent. Thus, then, we may describe the several species of\ndemocracies.\nCHAPTER V\nOf the different species of oligarchies one is, when the right to the\noffices is regulated by a certain census; so that the poor, although the\nmajority, have no share in it; while all those who are included therein\ntake part in the management of public affairs. Another sort is, when\n[1292b] the magistrates are men of very small fortune, who upon any\nvacancy do themselves fill it up: and if they do this out of the\ncommunity at large, the state approaches to an aristocracy; if out of\nany particular class of people, it will be an oligarchy. Another sort of\noligarchy is, when the power is an hereditary nobility. The fourth is,\nwhen the power is in the same hands as the other, but not under the\ncontrol of law; and this sort of oligarchy exactly corresponds to a\ntyranny in monarchies, and to that particular species of democracies\nwhich I last mentioned in treating of that state: this has the\nparticular name of a dynasty. These are the different sorts of\noligarchies and democracies.\nIt should also be known, that it often happens that a free state, where\nthe supreme power is in the laws, may not be democratic, and yet in\nconsequence of the established manners and customs of the people, may\nbe governed as if it was; so, on the other hand, where the laws may\ncountenance a more democratic form of government, these may make the\nstate inclining to an oligarchy; and this chiefly happens when there\nhas been any alteration in the government; for the people do not easily\nchange, but love their own ancient customs; and it is by small degrees\nonly that one thing takes place of another; so that the ancient laws\nwill remain, while the power will be in the hands of those who have\nbrought about a revolution in the state.\nCHAPTER VI\nIt is evident from what has been said, that there are as many different\nsorts of democracies and oligarchies as I have reckoned up: for, of\nnecessity, either all ranks of the people which I have enumerated must\nhave a share in the government, or some only, and others not; for when\nthe husbandmen, and those only who possess moderate fortunes, have the\nsupreme power, they will govern according to law; for as they must get\ntheir livings by their employs, they have but little leisure for public\nbusiness: they will therefore establish proper laws, and never call\npublic assemblies but when there is a necessity for them; and they will\nreadily let every one partake with them in the administration of public\naffairs as soon as they possess that fortune which the law requires for\ntheir qualification: every one, therefore, who is qualified will have\nhis share in the government: for to exclude any would be to make the\ngovernment an oligarchy, and for all to have leisure to attend\nwithout they had a subsistence would be impossible: for these reasons,\ntherefore, this government is a species of democracy. Another species is\ndistinguished by the mode of electing their magistrates, in which every\none is eligible, to whose birth there are no objections, provided he is\nsupposed to have leisure to attend: for which reason in such a democracy\nthe supreme power will be vested in the laws, as there will be nothing\npaid to those who go to the public assemblies. A third species is where\nevery freeman has a right to a share in the government, which he will\nnot accept for the cause already assigned; for which reason here also\nthe supreme power will be in the law. The fourth species [1293a] of\ndemocracy, the last which was established in order of time, arose when\ncities were greatly enlarged to what they were at first, and when the\npublic revenue became something considerable; for then the populace, on\naccount of their numbers, were admitted to share in the management of\npublic affairs, for then even the poorest people were at leisure to\nattend to them, as they received wages for so doing; nay, they were more\nso than others, as they were not hindered by having anything of their\nown to mind, as the rich had; for which reason these last very often did\nnot frequent the public assemblies and the courts of justice: thus the\nsupreme power was lodged in the poor, and not in the laws. These are\nthe different sorts of democracies, and such are the causes which\nnecessarily gave birth to them.\nThe first species of oligarchy is, when the generality of the state are\nmen of moderate and not too large property; for this gives them leisure\nfor the management of public affairs: and, as they are a numerous body,\nit necessarily follows that the supreme power must be in the laws, and\nnot in men; for as they are far removed from a monarchical government,\nand have not sufficient fortune to neglect their private affairs, while\nthey are too many to be supported by the public, they will of course\ndetermine to be governed by the laws, and not by each other. But if the\nmen of property in the state are but few, and their property is large,\nthen an oligarchy of the second sort will take place; for those who have\nmost power will think that they have a right to lord it over the others;\nand, to accomplish this, they will associate to themselves some who have\nan inclination for public affairs, and as they are not powerful enough\nto govern without law, they will make a law for that purpose. And if\nthose few who have large fortunes should acquire still greater power,\nthe oligarchy will then alter into one of the third sort; for they will\nget all the offices of the state into their own hands by a law which\ndirects the son to succeed upon the death of his father; and,\nafter that, when, by means of their increasing wealth and powerful\nconnections, they extend still further their oppression, a monarchical\ndynasty will directly succeed wherein men will be supreme, and not the\nlaw; and this is the fourth species of an oligarchy correspondent to the\nlast-mentioned class of democracies.\nCHAPTER VII\nThere are besides two other states, a democracy and an oligarchy, one\nof which all speak of, and it is always esteemed a species of the\nfour sorts; and thus they reckon them up; a monarchy, an oligarchy, a\ndemocracy, and this fourth which they call an aristocracy. There is\nalso a fifth, which bears a name that is also common to the other four,\nnamely, a state: but as this is seldom to be met with, it has escaped\nthose who have endeavoured to enumerate the different sorts of\ngovernments, which [1293b] they fix at four only, as does Plato in his\nRepublic.\nAn aristocracy, of which I have already treated in the first book, is\nrightly called so; for a state governed by the best men, upon the most\nvirtuous principles, and not upon any hypothesis, which even good men\nmay propose, has alone a right to be called an aristocracy, for it is\nthere only that a man is at once a good man and a good citizen; while in\nother states men are good only relative to those states. Moreover, there\nare some other states which are called by the same name, that differ\nboth from oligarchies and free states, wherein not only the rich but\nalso the virtuous have a share in the administration; and have therefore\nacquired the name of aristocracies; for in those governments wherein\nvirtue is not their common care, there are still men of worth and\napproved goodness. Whatever state, then, like the Carthaginians,\nfavours the rich, the virtuous, and the citizens at large, is a sort\nof aristocracy: when only the two latter are held in esteem, as at\nLacedaemon, and the state is jointly composed of these, it is a virtuous\ndemocracy. These are the two species of aristocracies after the first,\nwhich is the best of all governments. There is also a third, which is,\nwhenever a free state inclines to the dominion of a few.\nCHAPTER VIII\nIt now remains for us to treat of that government which is particularly\ncalled a free state, and also of a tyranny; and the reason for my\nchoosing to place that free state here is, because this, as well\nas those aristocracies already mentioned, although they do not seem\nexcesses, yet, to speak true, they have all departed from what a perfect\ngovernment is. Nay, they are deviations both of them equally from other\nforms, as I said at the beginning. It is proper to mention a tyranny the\nlast of all governments, for it is of all others the least like one:\nbut as my intention is to treat of all governments in general, for this\nreason that also, as I have said, will be taken into consideration in\nits proper place.\nI shall now inquire into a free state and show what it is; and we shall\nthe better understand its positive nature as we have already described\nan oligarchy and a democracy; for a free state is indeed nothing more\nthan a mixture of them, and it has been usual to call those which\nincline most to a democracy, a free state; those which incline most to\nan oligarchy, an aristocracy, because those who are rich are generally\nmen of family and education; besides, they enjoy those things which\nothers are often guilty of crimes to procure: for which reason they are\nregarded as men of worth and honour and note.\nSince, then, it is the genius of an aristocracy to allot the larger\npart of the government to the best citizens, they therefore say, that\nan oligarchy is chiefly composed of those men who are worthy and\nhonourable: now it [1294a] seems impossible that where the government\nis in the hands of the good, there the laws should not be good, but bad;\nor, on the contrary, that where the government is in the hands of the\nbad, there the laws should be good; nor is a government well constituted\nbecause the laws are, without at the same time care is taken that they\nare observed; for to enforce obedience to the laws which it makes is one\nproof of a good constitution in the state-another is, to have laws well\ncalculated for those who are to abide by them; for if they are improper\nthey must be obeyed: and this may be done two ways, either by their\nbeing the best relative to the particular state, or the best absolutely.\nAn aristocracy seems most likely to confer the honours of the state on\nthe virtuous; for virtue is the object of an aristocracy, riches of an\noligarchy, and liberty of a democracy; for what is approved of by the\nmajority will prevail in all or in each of these three different states;\nand that which seems good to most of those who compose the community\nwill prevail: for what is called a state prevails in many communities,\nwhich aim at a mixture of rich and poor, riches and liberty: as for\nthe rich, they are usually supposed to take the place of the worthy and\nhonourable. As there are three things which claim an equal rank in the\nstate, freedom, riches, and virtue (for as for the fourth, rank, it is\nan attendant on two of the others, for virtue and riches are the origin\nof family), it is evident, that the conjuncture of the rich and the poor\nmake up a free state; but that all three tend to an aristocracy more\nthan any other, except that which is truly so, which holds the first\nrank.\nWe have already seen that there are governments different from a\nmonarchy, a democracy, and an oligarchy; and what they are, and wherein\nthey differ from each other; and also aristocracies and states properly\nso called, which are derived from them; and it is evident that these are\nnot much unlike each other.\nCHAPTER IX\nWe shall next proceed to show how that government which is peculiarly\ncalled a state arises alongside of democracy and oligarchy, and how it\nought to be established; and this will at the same time show what are\nthe proper boundaries of both these governments, for we must mark out\nwherein they differ from one another, and then from both these compose\na state of such parts of each of them as will show from whence they were\ntaken.\nThere are three different ways in which two states may be blended and\njoined together; for, in the first place, all those rules may be adopted\nwhich the laws of each of them have ordered; as for instance in the\njudicial department, for in an oligarchy the rich are fined if they do\nnot come to the court as jurymen, but the poor are not paid for their\nattendance; but in democracies they are, while the rich are not fined\nfor their neglect. Now these things, as being common to both, are fit\nto be observed in a free [1294b] state which is composed of both. This,\nthen, is one way in which they may be joined together. In the second\nplace, a medium may be taken between the different methods which each\nstate observes; for instance, in a democracy the right to vote in the\npublic assembly is either confined by no census at all, or limited by a\nvery small one; in an oligarchy none enjoy it but those whose census is\nhigh: therefore, as these two practices are contrary to each other, a\ncensus between each may be established in such a state. In the third\nplace, different laws of each community may be adopted; as, for\ninstance, as it seems correspondent to the nature of a democracy, that\nthe magistrates should be chosen by lot, but an aristocracy by vote, and\nin the one state according to a census, but not in the other: let, then,\nan aristocracy and a free state copy something from each of them; let\nthem follow an oligarchy in choosing their magistrates by vote, but a\ndemocracy in not admitting of any census, and thus blend together the\ndifferent customs of the two governments. But the best proof of a happy\nmixture of a democracy and an oligarchy is this, when a person may\nproperly call the same state a democracy and an oligarchy. It is evident\nthat those who speak of it in this manner are induced to it because both\nthese governments are there well blended together: and indeed this\nis common to all mediums, that the extremes of each side should be\ndiscerned therein, as at Lacedaemon; for many affirm that it is a\ndemocracy from the many particulars in which it follows that form of\ngovernment; as for instance, in the first place, in the bringing up of\ntheir children, for the rich and poor are brought up in the same manner;\nand their education is such that the children of the poor may partake of\nit; and the same rules are observed when they are youths and men, there\nis no distinction between a rich person and a poor one; and in their\npublic tables the same provision is served to all. The rich also wear\nonly such clothes as the poorest man is able to purchase. Moreover, with\nrespect to two magistracies of the highest rank, one they have a right\nto elect to, the other to fill; namely, the senate and the ephori.\nOthers consider it as an oligarchy, the principles of which it follows\nin many things, as in choosing all their officers by vote, and not by\nlot; in there being but a few who have a right to sit in judgment on\ncapital causes and the like. Indeed, a state which is well composed of\ntwo others ought to resemble them both, and neither, Such a state ought\nto have its means of preservation in itself, and not without; and when I\nsay in itself, I do not mean that it should owe this to the forbearance\nof their neighbours, for this may happen to a bad government, but to\nevery member of the community's not being willing that there should be\nthe least alteration in their constitution. Such is the method in which\na free state or aristocracy ought to be established.\nCHAPTER X\nIt now remains to treat of a tyranny; not that there is [1295a] much\nto be said on that subject, but as it makes part of our plan, since\nwe enumerated it amongst our different sorts of governments. In the\nbeginning of this work we inquired into the nature of kingly government,\nand entered into a particular examination of what was most properly\ncalled so, and whether it was advantageous to a state or not, and what\nit should be, and how established; and we divided a tyranny into two\npieces when we were upon this subject, because there is something\nanalogous between this and a kingly government, for they are both of\nthem established by law; for among some of the barbarians they elect a\nmonarch with absolute power, and formerly among the Greeks there were\nsome such, whom they called sesumnetes. Now these differ from each\nother; for some possess only kingly power regulated by law, and\nrule those who voluntarily submit to their government; others rule\ndespotically according to their own will. There is a third species of\ntyranny, most properly so called, which is the very opposite to kingly\npower; for this is the government of one who rules over his equals and\nsuperiors without being accountable for his conduct, and whose object is\nhis own advantage, and not the advantage of those he governs; for which\nreason he rules by compulsion, for no freemen will ever willingly submit\nto such a government. These are the different species of tyrannies,\ntheir principles, and their causes.\nCHAPTER XI\nWe proceed now to inquire what form of government and what manner\nof life is best for communities in general, not adapting it to that\nsuperior virtue which is above the reach of the vulgar, or that\neducation which every advantage of nature and fortune only can furnish,\nnor to those imaginary plans which may be formed at pleasure; but to\nthat mode of life which the greater part of mankind can attain to,\nand that government which most cities may establish: for as to those\naristocracies which we have now mentioned, they are either too perfect\nfor a state to support, or one so nearly alike to that state we now\ngoing to inquire into, that we shall treat of them both as one.\nThe opinions which we form upon these subjects must depend upon one\ncommon principle: for if what I have said in my treatise on Morals is\ntrue, a happy life must arise from an uninterrupted course of virtue;\nand if virtue consists in a certain medium, the middle life must\ncertainly be the happiest; which medium is attainable [1295b] by\nevery one. The boundaries of virtue and vice in the state must also\nnecessarily be the same as in a private person; for the form of\ngovernment is the life of the city. In every city the people are divided\ninto three sorts; the very rich, the very poor, and those who are\nbetween them. If this is universally admitted, that the mean is best, it\nis evident that even in point of fortune mediocrity is to be preferred;\nfor that state is most submissive to reason; for those who are very\nhandsome, or very strong, or very noble, or very rich; or, on the\ncontrary; those who are very poor, or very weak, or very mean, with\ndifficulty obey it; for the one are capricious and greatly flagitious,\nthe other rascally and mean, the crimes of each arising from their\ndifferent excesses: nor will they go through the different offices\nof the state; which is detrimental to it: besides, those who excel in\nstrength, in riches, or friends, or the like, neither know how nor are\nwilling to submit to command: and this begins at home when they are\nboys; for there they are brought up too delicately to be accustomed to\nobey their preceptors: as for the very poor, their general and excessive\nwant of what the rich enjoy reduces them to a state too mean: so that\nthe one know not how to command, but to be commanded as slaves, the\nothers know not how to submit to any command, nor to command themselves\nbut with despotic power.\nA city composed of such men must therefore consist of slaves and\nmasters, not freemen; where one party must hate, and the other\ndespise, where there could be no possibility of friendship or political\ncommunity: for community supposes affection; for we do not even on the\nroad associate with our enemies. It is also the genius of a city to be\ncomposed as much as possible of equals; which will be most so when the\ninhabitants are in the middle state: from whence it follows, that that\ncity must be best framed which is composed of those whom we say are\nnaturally its proper members. It is men of this station also who will be\nbest assured of safety and protection; for they will neither covet what\nbelongs to others, as the poor do; nor will others covet what is theirs,\nas the poor do what belongs to the rich; and thus, without plotting\nagainst any one, or having any one plot against them, they will live\nfree from danger: for which reason Phocylides wisely wishes for the\nmiddle state, as being most productive of happiness. It is plain, then,\nthat the most perfect political community must be amongst those who are\nin the middle rank, and those states are best instituted wherein these\nare a larger and more respectable part, if possible, than both the\nother; or, if that cannot be, at least than either of them separate;\nso that being thrown into the balance it may prevent either scale from\npreponderating.\nIt is therefore the greatest happiness which the citizens can enjoy to\npossess a moderate and convenient fortune; for when some possess too\nmuch, and others nothing at [1296a] all, the government must either be\nin the hands of the meanest rabble or else a pure oligarchy; or, from\nthe excesses of both, a tyranny; for this arises from a headstrong\ndemocracy or an oligarchy, but very seldom when the members of the\ncommunity are nearly on an equality with each other. We will assign a\nreason for this when we come to treat of the alterations which different\nstates are likely to undergo. The middle state is therefore best, as\nbeing least liable to those seditions and insurrections which disturb\nthe community; and for the same reason extensive governments are least\nliable to these inconveniences; for there those in a middle state are\nvery numerous, whereas in small ones it is easy to pass to the two\nextremes, so as hardly to have any in a medium remaining, but the\none half rich, the other poor: and from the same principle it is that\ndemocracies are more firmly established and of longer continuance than\noligarchies; but even in those when there is a want of a proper number\nof men of middling fortune, the poor extend their power too far, abuses\narise, and the government is soon at an end.\nWe ought to consider as a proof of what I now advance, that the best\nlawgivers themselves were those in the middle rank of life, amongst whom\nwas Solon, as is evident from his poems, and Lycurgus, for he was not\na king, and Charondas, and indeed most others. What has been said will\nshow us why of so many free states some have changed to democracies,\nothers to oligarchies: for whenever the number of those in the middle\nstate has been too small, those who were the more numerous, whether the\nrich or the poor, always overpowered them and assumed to themselves the\nadministration of public affairs; from hence arose either a democracy\nor an oligarchy. Moreover, when in consequence of their disputes and\nquarrels with each other, either the rich get the better of the poor, or\nthe poor of the rich, neither of them will establish a free state;\nbut, as the record of their victory, one which inclines to their own\nprinciples, and form either a democracy or an oligarchy.\nThose who made conquests in Greece, having all of them an eye to the\nrespective forms of government in their own cities, established either\ndemocracies or oligarchies, not considering what was serviceable to the\nstate, but what was similar to their own; for which reason a government\nhas never been established where the supreme power has been placed\namongst those of the middling rank, or very seldom; and, amongst a few,\none man only of those who have yet been conquerors has been persuaded\nto give the preference to this order of [1296b] men: it is indeed an\nestablished custom with the inhabitants of most cities not to desire an\nequality, but either to aspire to govern, or when they are conquered, to\nsubmit.\nThus we have shown what the best state is, and why. It will not be\ndifficult to perceive of the many states which there are, for we have\nseen that there are various forms both of democracies and oligarchies,\nto which we should give the first place, to which the second, and in\nthe same manner the next also; and to observe what are the particular\nexcellences and defects of each, after we have first described the best\npossible; for that must be the best which is nearest to this, that worst\nwhich is most distant from the medium, without any one has a particular\nplan of his own which he judges by. I mean by this, that it may happen,\nthat although one form of government may be better than another, yet\nthere is no reason to prevent another from being preferable thereunto in\nparticular circumstances and for particular purposes.\nCHAPTER XII\nAfter what has been said, it follows that we should now show what\nparticular form of government is most suitable for particular persons;\nfirst laying this down as a general maxim, that that party which desires\nto support the actual administration of the state ought always to be\nsuperior to that which would alter it. Every city is made up of quality\nand quantity: by quality I mean liberty, riches, education, and family,\nand by quantity its relative populousness: now it may happen that\nquality may exist in one of those parts of which the city is composed,\nand quantity in another; thus the number of the ignoble may be greater\nthan the number of those of family, the number of the poor than that of\nthe rich; but not so that the quantity of the one shall overbalance the\nquality of the other; those must be properly adjusted to each other; for\nwhere the number of the poor exceeds the proportion we have mentioned,\nthere a democracy will rise up, and if the husbandry should have\nmore power than others, it will be a democracy of husbandmen; and the\ndemocracy will be a particular species according to that class of\nmen which may happen to be most numerous: thus, should these be the\nhusbandmen, it will be of these, and the best; if of mechanics and those\nwho hire themselves out, the worst possible: in the same manner it may\nbe of any other set between these two. But when the rich and the noble\nprevail more by their quality than they are deficient in quantity, there\nan oligarchy ensues; and this oligarchy may be of different species,\naccording to the nature of the prevailing party. Every legislator in\nframing his constitution ought to have a particular regard to those in\nthe middle rank of life; and if he intends an oligarchy, these should\nbe the object of his laws; if a democracy, to these they should be\nentrusted; and whenever their number exceeds that of the two others, or\nat least one of them, they give [1297a] stability to the constitution;\nfor there is no fear that the rich and the poor should agree to conspire\ntogether against them, for neither of these will choose to serve the\nother. If any one would choose to fix the administration on the widest\nbasis, he will find none preferable to this; for to rule by turns is\nwhat the rich and the poor will not submit to, on account of their\nhatred to each other. It is, moreover, allowed that an arbitrator is the\nmost proper person for both parties to trust to; now this arbitrator is\nthe middle rank.\nThose who would establish aristocratical governments are mistaken not\nonly in giving too much power to the rich, but also in deceiving the\ncommon people; for at last, instead of an imaginary good, they must feel\na real evil, for the encroachments of the rich are more destructive to\nthe state than those of the poor.\nCHAPTER XIII\nThere are five particulars in which, under fair pretences, the rich\ncraftily endeavour to undermine the rights of the people, these are\ntheir public assemblies, their offices of state, their courts of\njustice, their military power, and their gymnastic exercises. With\nrespect to their public assemblies, in having them open to all, but in\nfining the rich only, or others very little, for not attending; with\nrespect to offices, in permitting the poor to swear off, but not\ngranting this indulgence to those who are within the census;\nwith respect to their courts of justice, in fining the rich for\nnon-attendance, but the poor not at all, or those a great deal, and\nthese very little, as was done by the laws of Charondas. In some\nplaces every citizen who was enrolled had a right to attend the public\nassemblies and to try causes; which if they did not do, a very heavy\nfine was laid upon them; that through fear of the fine they might avoid\nbeing enrolled, as they were then obliged to do neither the one nor the\nother. The same spirit of legislation prevailed with respect to their\nbearing arms and their gymnastic exercises; for the poor are excused if\nthey have no arms, but the rich are fined; the same method takes place\nif they do not attend their gymnastic exercises, there is no penalty on\none, but there is on the other: the consequence of which is, that the\nfear of this penalty induces the rich to keep the one and attend the\nother, while the poor do neither. These are the deceitful contrivances\nof oligarchical legislators.\nThe contrary prevails in a democracy; for there they make the poor a\nproper allowance for attending the assemblies and the courts, but give\nthe rich nothing for doing it: whence it is evident, that if any one\nwould properly blend these customs together, they must extend both the\npay and the fine to every member of the community, and then every one\nwould share in it, whereas part only now do. The citizens of a free\nstate ought to [1297b] consist of those only who bear arms: with respect\nto their census it is not easy to determine exactly what it ought to be,\nbut the rule that should direct upon this subject should be to make it\nas extensive as possible, so that those who are enrolled in it make up\na greater part of the people than those who are not; for those who are\npoor, although they partake not of the offices of the state, are willing\nto live quiet, provided that no one disturbs them in their property: but\nthis is not an easy matter; for it may not always happen, that those who\nare at the head of public affairs are of a humane behaviour. In time\nof war the poor are accustomed to show no alacrity without they have\nprovisions found them; when they have, then indeed they are willing to\nfight.\nIn some governments the power is vested not only in those who bear arms,\nbut also in those who have borne them. Among the Malienses the state was\ncomposed of these latter only, for all the officers were soldiers who\nhad served their time. And the first states in Greece which succeeded\nthose where kingly power was established, were governed by the military.\nFirst of all the horse, for at that time the strength and excellence of\nthe army depended on the horse, for as to the heavy-armed foot they were\nuseless without proper discipline; but the art of tactics was not known\nto the ancients, for which reason their strength lay in their horse: but\nwhen cities grew larger, and they depended more on their foot, greater\nnumbers partook of the freedom of the city; for which reason what we\ncall republics were formerly called democracies. The ancient governments\nwere properly oligarchies or kingdoms; for on account of the few persons\nin each state, it would have been impossible to have found a sufficient\nnumber of the middle rank; so these being but few, and those used to\nsubordination, they more easily submitted to be governed.\nWe have now shown why there are many sorts of governments, and others\ndifferent from those we have treated of: for there are more species of\ndemocracies than one, and the like is true of other forms, and what are\ntheir differences, and whence they arise; and also of all others\nwhich is the best, at least in general; and which is best suited for\nparticular people.\nCHAPTER XIV\nWe will now proceed to make some general reflections upon the\ngovernments next in order, and also to consider each of them in\nparticular; beginning with those principles which appertain to each: now\nthere are three things in all states which a careful legislator ought\nwell to consider, which are of great consequence to all, and which\nproperly attended to the state must necessarily be happy; and according\nto the variation of which the one will differ from the other. The first\nof these is the [1298a] public assembly; the second the officers of the\nstate, that is, who they ought to be, and with what power they should be\nentrusted, and in what manner they should be appointed; the third, the\njudicial department.\nNow it is the proper business of the public assembly to determine\nconcerning war and peace, making or breaking off alliances, to enact\nlaws, to sentence to death, banishment, or confiscation of goods, and to\ncall the magistrates to account for their behaviour when in office. Now\nthese powers must necessarily be entrusted to the citizens in general,\nor all of them to some; either to one magistrate or more; or some to\none, and some to another, or some to all, but others to some: to entrust\nall to all is in the spirit of a democracy, for the people aim at\nequality. There are many methods of delegating these powers to the\ncitizens at large, one of which is to let them execute them by turn, and\nnot altogether, as was done by Tellecles, the Milesian, in his state. In\nothers the supreme council is composed of the different magistrates,\nand they succeed to the offices of the community by proper divisions of\ntribes, wards, and other very small proportions, till every one in his\nturn goes through them: nor does the whole community ever meet together,\nwithout it is when new laws are enacted, or some national affair is\ndebated, or to hear what the magistrates have to propose to them.\nAnother method is for the people to meet in a collective body, but\nonly for the purpose of holding the comitia, making laws, determining\nconcerning war or peace, and inquiring into the conduct of their\nmagistrates, while the remaining part of the public business is\nconducted by the magistrates, who have their separate departments, and\nare chosen out of the whole community either by vote or ballot. Another\nmethod is for the people in general to meet for the choice of the\nmagistrates, and to examine into their conduct; and also to deliberate\nconcerning war and alliances, and to leave other things to the\nmagistrates, whoever happen to be chosen, whose particular employments\nare such as necessarily require persons well skilled therein. A fourth\nmethod is for every person to deliberate upon every subject in public\nassembly, where the magistrates can determine nothing of themselves, and\nhave only the privilege of giving their opinions first; and this is the\nmethod of the most pure democracy, which is analogous to the proceedings\nin a dynastic oligarchy and a tyrannic monarchy.\nThese, then, are the methods in which public business is conducted in a\ndemocracy. When the power is in the hands of part of the community\nonly, it is an oligarchy and this also admits of different customs; for\nwhenever the officers of the state are chosen out of those who have a\nmoderate fortune, and these from that circumstance are many, and\nwhen they depart not from that line which the law has laid down, but\ncarefully follow it, and when all within the census are eligible,\ncertainly it is then an oligarchy, but founded on true principles of\ngovernment [1298b] from its moderation. When the people in general do\nnot partake of the deliberative power, but certain persons chosen for\nthat purpose, who govern according to law; this also, like the first,\nis an oligarchy. When those who have the deliberative power elect each\nother, and the son succeeds to the father, and when they can supersede\nthe laws, such a government is of necessity a strict oligarchy. When\nsome persons determine on one thing, and others on another, as war and\npeace, and when all inquire into the conduct of their magistrates, and\nother things are left to different officers, elected either by vote or\nlot, then the government is an aristocracy or a free state. When some\nare chosen by vote and others by lot, and these either from the people\nin general, or from a certain number elected for that purpose, or if\nboth the votes and the lots are open to all, such a state is partly an\naristocracy, partly a free government itself. These are the different\nmethods in which the deliberative power is vested in different states,\nall of whom follow some regulation here laid down. It is advantageous to\na democracy, in the present sense of the word, by which I mean a state\nwherein the people at large have a supreme power, even over the laws, to\nhold frequent public assemblies; and it will be best in this particular\nto imitate the example of oligarchies in their courts of justice; for\nthey fine those who are appointed to try causes if they do not attend,\nso should they reward the poor for coming to the public assemblies:\nand their counsels will be best when all advise with each other, the\ncitizens with the nobles, the nobles with the citizens. It is also\nadvisable when the council is to be composed of part of the citizens, to\nelect, either by vote or lot, an equal number of both ranks. It is also\nproper, if the common people in the state are very numerous, either not\nto pay every one for his attendance, but such a number only as will make\nthem equal to the nobles, or to reject many of them by lot.\nIn an oligarchy they should either call up some of the common people to\nthe council, or else establish a court, as is done in some other states,\nwhom they call pre-advisers or guardians of the laws, whose business\nshould be to propose first what they should afterwards enact. By this\nmeans the people would have a place in the administration of public\naffairs, without having it in their power to occasion any disorder in\nthe government. Moreover, the people may be allowed to have a vote\nin whatever bill is proposed, but may not themselves propose anything\ncontrary thereto; or they may give their advice, while the power of\ndetermining may be with the magistrates only. It is also necessary to\nfollow a contrary practice to what is established in democracies,\nfor the people should be allowed the power of pardoning, but not\nof condemning, for the cause should be referred back again to the\nmagistrates: whereas the contrary takes place in republics; for the\npower of pardoning is with the few, but not of condemning, which is\nalways referred [1299a] to the people at large. And thus we determine\nconcerning the deliberative power in any state, and in whose hands it\nshall be.\nCHAPTER XV\nWe now proceed to consider the choice of magistrates; for this branch of\npublic business contains many different Parts, as how many there shall\nbe, what shall be their particular office, and with respect to time how\nlong each of them shall continue in place; for some make it six months,\nothers shorter, others for a year, others for a much longer time; or\nwhether they should be perpetual or for a long time, or neither; for\nthe same person may fill the same office several times, or he may not be\nallowed to enjoy it even twice, but only once: and also with respect to\nthe appointment of magistrates, who are to be eligible, who is to choose\nthem, and in what manner; for in all these particulars we ought properly\nto distinguish the different ways which may be followed; and then to\nshow which of these is best suited to such and such governments.\nNow it is not easy to determine to whom we ought properly to give the\nname of magistrate, for a government requires many persons in office;\nbut every one of those who is either chosen by vote or lot is not to be\nreckoned a magistrate. The priests, for instance, in the first place;\nfor these are to be considered as very different from civil magistrates:\nto these we may add the choregi and heralds; nay, even ambassadors are\nelected: there are some civil employments which belong to the citizens;\nand these are either when they are all engaged in one thing, as when as\nsoldiers they obey their general, or when part of them only are, as in\ngoverning the women or educating the youth; and also some economic, for\nthey often elect corn-meters: others are servile, and in which, if they\nare rich, they employ slaves. But indeed they are most properly called\nmagistrates, who are members of the deliberative council, or decide\ncauses, or are in some command, the last more especially, for to command\nis peculiar to magistrates. But to speak truth, this question is of\nno great consequence, nor is it the province of the judges to decide\nbetween those who dispute about words; it may indeed be an object of\nspeculative inquiry; but to inquire what officers are necessary in a\nstate, and how many, and what, though not most necessary, may yet be\nadvantageous in a well-established government, is a much more useful\nemployment, and this with respect to all states in general, as well as\nto small cities.\nIn extensive governments it is proper to allot one employment to one\nperson, as there are many to serve the public in so numerous a society,\nwhere some may be passed over for a long time, and others never be in\noffice but once; and indeed everything is better done which has the\nwhole attention of one person, than when that [1299b] attention is\ndivided amongst many; but in small states it is necessary that a few of\nthe citizens should execute many employments; for their numbers are so\nsmall it will not be convenient to have many of them in office at the\nsame time; for where shall we find others to succeed them in turn? Small\nstates will sometimes want the same magistrates and the same laws as\nlarge ones; but the one will not want to employ them so often as the\nother; so that different charges may be intrusted to the same person\nwithout any inconvenience, for they will not interfere with each\nother, and for want of sufficient members in the community it will be\nnecessary. If we could tell how many magistrates are necessary in every\ncity, and how many, though not necessary, it is yet proper to have, we\ncould then the better know how many different offices one might assign\nto one magistrate. It is also necessary to know what tribunals in\ndifferent places should have different things under their jurisdiction,\nand also what things should always come under the cognisance of the same\nmagistrate; as, for instance, decency of manners, shall the clerk of the\nmarket take cognisance of that if the cause arises in the market, and\nanother magistrate in another place, or the same magistrate everywhere:\nor shall there be a distinction made of the fact, or the parties? as,\nfor instance, in decency of manners, shall it be one cause when it\nrelates to a man, another when it relates to a woman?\nIn different states shall the magistrates be different or the same?\nI mean, whether in a democracy, an oligarchy, an aristocracy, and a\nmonarchy, the same persons shall have the same power? or shall it\nvary according to the different formation of the government? as in an\naristocracy the offices of the state are allotted to those who are well\neducated; in an oligarchy to those who are rich; in a democracy to the\nfreemen? Or shall the magistrates differ as the communities differ?\nFor it may happen that the very same may be sometimes proper, sometimes\notherwise: in this state it may be necessary that the magistrate have\ngreat powers, in that but small. There are also certain magistrates\npeculiar to certain states--as the pre-advisers are not proper in a\ndemocracy, but a senate is; for one such order is necessary, whose\nbusiness shall be to consider beforehand and prepare those bills which\nshall be brought before the people that they may have leisure to\nattend to their own affairs; and when these are few in number the state\ninclines to an oligarchy. The pre-advisers indeed must always be few\nfor they are peculiar to an oligarchy: and where there are both\nthese offices in the same state, the pre-adviser's is superior to\nthe senator's, the one having only a democratical power, the other an\noligarchical: and indeed the [1300a] power of the senate is lost in\nthose democracies, in which the people, meeting in one public assembly,\ntake all the business into their own hands; and this is likely to happen\neither when the community in general are in easy circumstances, or when\nthey are paid for their attendance; for they are then at leisure often\nto meet together and determine everything for themselves. A magistrate\nwhose business is to control the manners of the boys, or women, or who\ntakes any department similar to this, is to be found in an aristocracy,\nnot in a democracy; for who can forbid the wives of the poor from\nappearing in public? neither is such a one to be met with in an\noligarchy; for the women there are too delicate to bear control. And\nthus much for this subject. Let us endeavour to treat at large of the\nestablishment of magistrates, beginning from first principles. Now, they\ndiffer from each other in three ways, from which, blended together,\nall the varieties which can be imagined arise. The first of these\ndifferences is in those who appoint the magistrates, the second consists\nin those who are appointed, the third in the mode of appointment; and\neach of these three differ in three manners; for either all the citizens\nmay appoint collectively, or some out of their whole body, or some out\nof a particular order in it, according to fortune, family, or virtue, or\nsome other rule (as at Megara, where the right of election was amongst\nthose who had returned together to their country, and had reinstated\nthemselves by force of arms) and this either by vote or lot. Again,\nthese several modes may be differently formed together, as some\nmagistrates may be chosen by part of the community, others by the whole;\nsome out of part, others out of the whole; some by vote, others by lot:\nand each of these different modes admit of a four-fold subdivision; for\neither all may elect all by vote or by lot; and when all elect, they may\neither proceed without any distinction, or they may elect by a certain\ndivision of tribes, wards, or companies, till they have gone through the\nwhole community: and some magistrates may be elected one way, and others\nanother. Again, if some magistrates are elected either by vote or lot\nof all the citizens, or by the vote of some and the lot of some, or\nsome one way and some another; that is to say, some by the vote of all,\nothers by the lot of all, there will then be twelve different methods\nof electing the magistrates, without blending the two together. Of\nthese there are two adapted to a democracy; namely, to have all the\nmagistrates chosen out of all the people, either by vote or lot, or\nboth; that is to say, some of them by lot, some by vote. In a free state\nthe whole community should not elect at the same time, but some out of\nthe whole, or out of some particular rank; and this either by lot, or\nvote, or both: and they should elect either out of the whole community,\nor out of some particular persons in it, and this both by lot and vote.\nIn an oligarchy it is proper to choose some magistrates out of the whole\nbody of the citizens, some by vote, some by lot, others by both: by lot\nis most correspondent to that form of government. In a free aristocracy,\nsome magistrates [1300b] should be chosen out of the community in\ngeneral, others out of a particular rank, or these by choice, those\nby lot. In a pure oligarchy, the magistrates should be chosen out of\ncertain ranks, and by certain persons, and some of those by lot, others\nby both methods; but to choose them out of the whole community is not\ncorrespondent to the nature of this government. It is proper in an\naristocracy for the whole community to elect their magistrates out of\nparticular persons, and this by vote. These then are all the different\nways of electing of magistrates; and they have been allotted according\nto the nature of the different communities; but what mode of proceeding\nis proper for different communities, or how the offices ought to be\nestablished, or with what powers shall be particularly explained. I mean\nby the powers of a magistrate, what should be his particular province,\nas the management of the finances or the laws of the state; for\ndifferent magistrates have different powers, as that of the general of\nthe army differs from the clerk of the market.\nCHAPTER XVI\nOf the three parts of which a government is formed, we now come to\nconsider the judicial; and this also we shall divide in the same manner\nas we did the magisterial, into three parts. Of whom the judges shall\nconsist, and for what causes, and how. When I say of whom, I mean\nwhether they shall be the whole people, or some particulars; by for what\ncauses I mean, how many different courts shall be appointed; by how,\nwhether they shall be elected by vote or lot. Let us first determine how\nmany different courts there ought to be. Now these are eight. The\nfirst of these is the court of inspection over the behaviour of the\nmagistrates when they have quitted their office; the second is to punish\nthose who have injured the public; the third is to take cognisance of\nthose causes in which the state is a party; the fourth is to decide\nbetween magistrates and private persons, who appeal from a fine laid\nupon them; the fifth is to determine disputes which may arise concerning\ncontracts of great value; the sixth is to judge between foreigners, and\nof murders, of which there are different species; and these may all be\ntried by the same judges or by different ones; for there are murders\nof malice prepense and of chance-medley; there is also justifiable\nhomicide, where the fact is admitted, and the legality of it disputed.\nThere is also another court called at Athens the Court of Phreattae,\nwhich determines points relating to a murder committed by one who has\nrun away, to decide whether he shall return; though such an affair\nhappens but seldom, and in very large cities; the seventh, to determine\ncauses wherein strangers are concerned, and this whether they are\nbetween stranger and stranger or between a stranger and a citizen. The\neighth and last is for small actions, from one to five drachma's, or a\nlittle more; for these ought also to be legally determined, but not to\nbe brought before the whole body of the judges. But without entering\ninto any particulars concerning actions for murder, and those wherein\nstrangers are the parties, let us particularly treat of those courts\nwhich have the jurisdiction of those matters which more particularly\nrelate to the affairs of the community and which if not well conducted\noccasion seditions and commotions in the state. Now, of necessity,\neither all persons must have a right to judge of all these different\ncauses, appointed for that purpose, either by vote or lot, or all of\nall, some of them by vote, and others by lot, or in some causes by vote,\nin others by lot. Thus there will be four sorts of judges. There [1301a]\nwill be just the same number also if they are chosen out of part of the\npeople only; for either all the judges must be chosen out of that part\neither by vote or lot, or some by lot and some by vote, or the judges in\nparticular causes must be chosen some by vote, others by lot; by which\nmeans there will be the same number of them also as was mentioned.\nBesides, different judges may be joined together; I mean those who are\nchosen out of the whole people or part of them or both; so that all\nthree may sit together in the same court, and this either by vote,\nlot, or both. And thus much for the different sorts of judges. Of these\nappointments that which admits all the community to be judges in all\ncauses is most suitable to a democracy; the second, which appoints that\ncertain persons shall judge all causes, to an oligarchy; the third,\nwhich appoints the whole community to be judges in some causes, but\nparticular persons in others, to an aristocracy or free state.\nBOOK V\nCHAPTER I\nWe have now gone through those particulars we proposed to speak of; it\nremains that we next consider from what causes and how alterations\nin government arise, and of what nature they are, and to what the\ndestruction of each state is owing; and also to what form any form of\npolity is most likely to shift into, and what are the means to be\nused for the general preservation of governments, as well as what are\napplicable to any particular state; and also of the remedies which\nare to be applied either to all in general, or to any one considered\nseparately, when they are in a state of corruption: and here we ought\nfirst to lay down this principle, that there are many governments, all\nof which approve of what is just and what is analogically equal; and yet\nhave failed from attaining thereunto, as we have already mentioned; thus\ndemocracies have arisen from supposing that those who are equal in one\nthing are so in every other circumstance; as, because they are equal\nin liberty, they are equal in everything else; and oligarchies, from\nsupposing that those who are unequal in one thing are unequal in all;\nthat when men are so in point of fortune, that inequality extends to\neverything else. Hence it follows, that those who in some respects are\nequal with others think it right to endeavour to partake of an equality\nwith them in everything; and those who are superior to others endeavour\nto get still more; and it is this more which is the inequality: thus\nmost states, though they have some notion of what is just, yet are\nalmost totally wrong; and, upon this account, when either party has not\nthat share in the administration which answers to his expectations, he\nbecomes seditious: but those who of all others have the greatest right\nto be so are the last that are; namely, those who excel in virtue;\nfor they alone can be called generally superior. There are, too, some\npersons of distinguished families who, because they are so, disdain to\nbe on an equality with others, for those esteem themselves noble who\nboast of their ancestors' merit and fortune: these, to speak truth, are\nthe origin and fountain from whence seditions arise. The alterations\nwhich men may propose to make in governments are two; for either they\nmay change the state already established into some other, as when\nthey propose to erect an oligarchy where there is a democracy; or a\ndemocracy, or free state, where there is an oligarchy, or an aristocracy\nfrom these, or those from that; or else, when they have no objection\nto the established government, which they like very well, but choose to\nhave the sole management in it themselves; either in the hands of a few\nor one only. They will also raise commotions concerning the degree in\nwhich they would have the established power; as if, for instance, the\ngovernment is an oligarchy, to have it more purely so, and in the same\nmanner if it is a democracy, or else to have it less so; and, in like\nmanner, whatever may be the nature of the government, either to extend\nor contract its powers; or else to make some alterations in some parts\nof it; as to establish or abolish a particular magistracy, as some\npersons say Lysander endeavoured to abolish the kingly power in Sparta;\nand Pausanias that of the ephori. Thus in Epidamnus there was an\nalteration in one part of the constitution, for instead of the philarchi\nthey established a senate. It is also necessary for all the magistrates\nat Athens; to attend in the court of the Helisea when any new magistrate\nis created: the power of the archon also in that state partakes of the\nnature of an oligarchy: inequality is always the occasion of sedition,\nbut not when those who are unequal are treated in a different manner\ncorrespondent to that inequality. Thus kingly power is unequal when\nexercised over equals. Upon the whole, those who aim after an equality\nare the cause of seditions. Equality is twofold, either in number or\nvalue. Equality in number is when two things contain the same parts or\nthe same quantity; equality in value is by proportion as two exceeds\none, and three two by the same number-thus by proportion four exceeds\ntwo, and two one in the same degree, for two is the same part of four\nthat one is of two; that is to say, half. Now, all agree in what is\nabsolutely and simply just; but, as we have already said they dispute\nconcerning proportionate value; for some persons, if they are equal in\none respect, think themselves equal in all; others, if they are superior\nin one thing, think they may claim the superiority in all; from whence\nchiefly arise two sorts of governments, a democracy and an oligarchy;\nfor nobility and virtue are to be found only [1302a] amongst a few;\nthe contrary amongst the many; there being in no place a hundred of\nthe first to be met with, but enough of the last everywhere. But to\nestablish a government entirely upon either of these equalities is\nwrong, and this the example of those so established makes evident,\nfor none of them have been stable; and for this reason, that it is\nimpossible that whatever is wrong at the first and in its principles\nshould not at last meet with a bad end: for which reason in some things\nan equality of numbers ought to take place, in others an equality in\nvalue. However, a democracy is safer and less liable to sedition than an\noligarchy; for in this latter it may arise from two causes, for either\nthe few in power may conspire against each other or against the\npeople; but in a democracy only one; namely, against the few who aim\nat exclusive power; but there is no instance worth speaking of, of\na sedition of the people against themselves. Moreover, a government\ncomposed of men of moderate fortunes comes much nearer to a democracy\nthan an oligarchy, and is the safest of all such states.\nCHAPTER II\nSince we are inquiring into the causes of seditions and revolutions\nin governments, we must begin entirely with the first principles from\nwhence they arise. Now these, so to speak, are nearly three in number;\nwhich we must first distinguish in general from each other, and\nendeavour to show in what situation people are who begin a sedition;\nand for what causes; and thirdly, what are the beginnings of political\ntroubles and mutual quarrels with each other. Now that cause which of\nall others most universally inclines men to desire to bring about a\nchange in government is that which I have already mentioned; for those\nwho aim at equality will be ever ready for sedition, if they see those\nwhom they esteem their equals possess more than they do, as well as\nthose also who are not content with equality but aim at superiority, if\nthey think that while they deserve more than, they have only equal with,\nor less than, their inferiors. Now, what they aim at may be either just\nor unjust; just, when those who are inferior are seditious, that they\nmay be equal; unjust, when those who are equal are so, that they may\nbe superior. These, then, are the situations in which men will be\nseditious: the causes for which they will be so are profit and honour;\nand their contrary: for, to avoid dishonour or loss of fortune by\nmulcts, either on their own account or their friends, they will raise\na commotion in the state. The original causes which dispose men to the\nthings which I have mentioned are, taken in one manner, seven in number,\nin another they are more; two of which are the same with those that\nhave been already mentioned: but influencing in a different manner;\nfor profit and honour sharpen men against each other; not to get the\npossession of them for themselves (which was what I just now supposed),\nbut when they see others, some justly, others [1302b] unjustly,\nengrossing them. The other causes are haughtiness, fear, eminence,\ncontempt, disproportionate increase in some part of the state. There are\nalso other things which in a different manner will occasion revolutions\nin governments; as election intrigues, neglect, want of numbers, a too\ngreat dissimilarity of circumstances.\nCHAPTER III\nWhat influence ill-treatment and profit have for this purpose, and how\nthey may be the causes of sedition, is almost self-evident; for when the\nmagistrates are haughty and endeavour to make greater profits than their\noffice gives them, they not only occasion seditions amongst each other,\nbut against the state also who gave them their power; and this their\navarice has two objects, either private property or the property of the\nstate. What influence honours have, and how they may occasion sedition,\nis evident enough; for those who are themselves unhonoured while they\nsee others honoured, will be ready for any disturbance: and these things\nare done unjustly when any one is either honoured or discarded contrary\nto their deserts, justly when they are according to them. Excessive\nhonours are also a cause of sedition when one person or more are greater\nthan the state and the power of the government can permit; for then\na monarchy or a dynasty is usually established: on which account the\nostracism was introduced in some places, as at Argos and Athens: though\nit is better to guard against such excesses in the founding of a state,\nthan when they have been permitted to take place, to correct them\nafterward. Those who have been guilty of crimes will be the cause of\nsedition, through fear of punishment; as will those also who expect an\ninjury, that they may prevent it; as was the case at Rhodes, when the\nnobles conspired against the people on account of the decrees they\nexpected would pass against them. Contempt also is a cause of sedition\nand conspiracies; as in oligarchies, where there are many who have\nno share in the administration. The rich also even in democracies,\ndespising the disorder and anarchy which will arise, hope to better\nthemselves by the same means which happened at Thebes after the battle\nof Oenophyta, where, in consequence of bad administration, the democracy\nwas destroyed; as it was at Megara, where the power of the people was\nlost through anarchy and disorder; the same thing happened at Syracuse\nbefore the tyranny of Gelon; and at Rhodes there was the same sedition\nbefore the popular government was overthrown. Revolutions in state will\nalso arise from a disproportionate increase; for as the body consists\nof many parts, it ought to increase proportion-ably to preserve its\nsymmetry, which would otherwise be destroyed; as if the foot was to\nbe four cubits long, and the rest of the body but two palms; it might\notherwise [1303a] be changed into an animal of a different form, if it\nincrease beyond proportion not only in quantity, but also in disposition\nof parts; so also a city consists of parts, some of which may often\nincrease without notice, as the number of poor in democracies and free\nstates. They will also sometimes happen by accident, as at Tarentum, a\nlittle after the Median war, where so many of the nobles were killed in\na battle by the lapygi, that from a free state the government was turned\ninto a democracy; and at Argos, where so many of the citizens were\nkilled by Cleomenes the Spartan, that they were obliged to admit several\nhusbandmen to the freedom of the state: and at Athens, through the\nunfortunate event of the infantry battles, the number of the nobles was\nreduced by the soldiers being chosen from the list of citizens in\nthe Lacedaemonian wars. Revolutions also sometimes take place in\na democracy, though seldomer; for where the rich grow numerous or\nproperties increase, they become oligarchies or dynasties. Governments\nalso sometimes alter without seditions by a combination of the meaner\npeople; as at Hersea: for which purpose they changed the mode of\nelection from votes to lots, and thus got themselves chosen: and by\nnegligence, as when the citizens admit those who are not friends to\nthe constitution into the chief offices of the state, which happened\nat Orus, when the oligarchy of the archons was put an end to at the\nelection of Heracleodorus, who changed that form of government into a\ndemocratic free state. By little and little, I mean by this, that very\noften great alterations silently take place in the form of government\nfrom people's overlooking small matters; as at Ambracia, where the\ncensus was originally small, but at last became nothing at all, as if a\nlittle and nothing at all were nearly or entirely alike. That state\nalso is liable to seditions which is composed of different nations, till\ntheir differences are blended together and undistinguishable; for as a\ncity cannot be composed of every multitude, so neither can it in every\ngiven time; for which reason all those republics which have hitherto\nbeen originally composed of different people or afterwards admitted\ntheir neighbours to the freedom of their city, have been most liable\nto revolutions; as when the Achaeans joined with the Traezenians\nin founding Sybaris; for soon after, growing more powerful than the\nTraezenians, they expelled them from the city; from whence came the\nproverb of Sybarite wickedness: and again, disputes from a like cause\nhappened at Thurium between the Sybarites and those who had joined with\nthem in building the city; for they assuming upon these, on account of\nthe country being their own, were driven out. And at Byzantium the new\ncitizens, being detected in plots against the state, were driven out of\nthe city by force of arms. The Antisseans also, having taken in those\nwho were banished from Chios, afterwards did the same thing; and\nalso the Zancleans, after having taken in the people of Samos. The\nAppolloniats, in the Euxine Sea, having admitted their sojourners to\nthe freedom of their city, were troubled with seditions: and the\nSyracusians, after the expulsion of their tyrants, having enrolled\n[1303b] strangers and mercenaries amongst their citizens, quarrelled\nwith each other and came to an open rupture: and the people of\nAmphipolis, having taken in a colony of Chalcidians, were the greater\npart of them driven out of the city by them. Many persons occasion\nseditions in oligarchies because they think themselves ill-used in not\nsharing the honours of the state with their equals, as I have already\nmentioned; but in democracies the principal people do the same because\nthey have not more than an equal share with others who are not equal\nto them. The situation of the place will also sometimes occasion\ndisturbances in the state when the ground is not well adapted for one\ncity; as at Clazomene, where the people who lived in that part of the\ntown called Chytrum quarrelled with them who lived in the island, and\nthe Colophonians with the Notians. At Athens too the disposition of the\ncitizens is not the same, for those who live in the Piraeus are more\nattached to a popular government than those who live in the city\nproperly so called; for as the interposition of a rivulet, however\nsmall, will occasion the line of the phalanx to fluctuate, so any\ntrifling disagreement will be the cause of seditions; but they will not\nso soon flow from anything else as from the disagreement between virtue\nand vice, and next to that between poverty and riches, and so on in\norder, one cause having more influence than another; one of which that I\nlast mentioned.\nCHAPTER IV\nBut seditions in government do not arise for little things, but from\nthem; for their immediate cause is something of moment. Now, trifling\nquarrels are attended with the greatest consequences when they arise\nbetween persons of the first distinction in the state, as was the\ncase with the Syracusians in a remote period; for a revolution in the\ngovernment was brought about by a quarrel between two young men who were\nin office, upon a love affair; for one of them being absent, the other\nseduced his mistress; he in his turn, offended with this, persuaded his\nfriend's wife to come and live with him; and upon this the whole city\ntook part either with the one or the other, and the government was\noverturned: therefore every one at the beginning of such disputes ought\nto take care to avoid the consequences; and to smother up all quarrels\nwhich may happen to arise amongst those in power, for the mischief lies\nin the beginning; for the beginning is said to be half of the business,\nso that what was then but a little fault will be found afterwards to\nbear its full proportion to what follows. Moreover, disputes between men\nof note involve the whole city in their consequences; in Hestiaea,\nafter the Median war: two brothers having a dispute about their paternal\nestate; he who was the poorer, from the other's having concealed part\nof the effects, and some money which his father had found, engaged the\npopular party on his side, while the other, who was rich, the men of\nfashion. And at Delphos, [1304a] a quarrel about a wedding was the\nbeginning of all the seditions that afterwards arose amongst them; for\nthe bridegroom, being terrified by some unlucky omen upon waiting\nupon the bride, went away without marrying her; which her relations\nresenting, contrived secretly to convey some sacred money into his\npocket while he was sacrificing, and then killed him as an impious\nperson. At Mitylene also, a dispute, which arose concerning a right\nof heritage, was the beginning of great evils, and a war with the\nAthenians, in which Paches took their city, for Timophanes, a man\nof fortune, leaving two daughters, Doxander, who was circumvented in\nprocuring them in marriage for his two sons, began a sedition, and\nexcited the Athenians to attack them, being the host of that state.\nThere was also a dispute at Phocea, concerning a right of inheritance,\nbetween Mnasis, the father of Mnasis, and Euthucrates, the father of\nOnomarchus, which brought on the Phoceans the sacred war. The government\ntoo of Epidamnus was changed from a quarrel that arose from an intended\nmarriage; for a certain man having contracted his daughter in marriage,\nthe father of the young person to whom she was contracted, being archon,\npunishes him, upon which account he, resenting the affront, associated\nhimself with those who were excluded from any share in the government,\nand brought about a revolution. A government may be changed either into\nan oligarchy, democracy, or a free state; when the magistrates, or any\npart of the city acquire great credit, or are increased in power, as the\ncourt of Areopagus at Athens, having procured great credit during the\nMedian war, added firmness to their administration; and, on the other\nhand, the maritime force, composed of the commonalty, having gained the\nvictory at Salamis, by their power at sea, got the lead in the state,\nand strengthened the popular party: and at Argos, the nobles,\nhaving gained great credit by the battle of Mantinea against the\nLacedaemonians, endeavoured to dissolve the democracy. And at Syracuse,\nthe victory in their war with the Athenians being owing to the common\npeople, they changed their free state into a democracy: and at Chalcis,\nthe people having taken off the tyrant Phocis, together with the nobles,\nimmediately seized the government: and at Ambracia also the people,\nhaving expelled the tyrant Periander, with his party, placed the\nsupreme power in themselves. And this in general ought to be known,\nthat whosoever has been the occasion of a state being powerful, whether\nprivate persons, or magistrates, a certain tribe, or any particular part\nof the citizens, or the multitude, be they who they will, will be the\ncause of disputes in the state. For either some persons, who envy them\nthe honours they have acquired, will begin to be seditious, or they,\non account of the dignity they have acquired, will not be content with\ntheir former equality. A state is also liable to commotions when those\nparts of it which seem to be opposite to each other approach to an\n[1304b] equality, as the rich and the common people; so that the part\nwhich is between them both is either nothing at all, or too little to be\nnoticed; for if one party is so much more powerful than the other, as\nto be evidently stronger, that other will not be willing to hazard the\ndanger: for which reason those who are superior in excellence and virtue\nwill never be the cause of seditions; for they will be too few for that\npurpose when compared to the many. In general, the beginning and the\ncauses of seditions in all states are such as I have now described, and\nrevolutions therein are brought about in two ways, either by violence or\nfraud: if by violence, either at first by compelling them to submit to\nthe change when it is made. It may also be brought about by fraud in\ntwo different ways, either when the people, being at first deceived,\nwillingly consent to an alteration in their government, and are\nafterwards obliged by force to abide by it: as, for instance, when the\nfour hundred imposed upon the people by telling them that the king\nof Persia would supply them with money for the war against the\nLacedaemonians; and after they had been guilty of this falsity, they\nendeavoured to keep possession of the supreme power; or when they are\nat first persuaded and afterwards consent to be governed: and by one of\nthese methods which I have mentioned are all revolutions in governments\nbrought about.\nCHAPTER V\nWe ought now to inquire into those events which will arise from these\ncauses in every species of government. Democracies will be most subject\nto revolutions from the dishonesty of their demagogues; for partly, by\ninforming against men of property, they induce them to join together\nthrough self-defence, for a common fear will make the greatest enemies\nunite; and partly by setting the common people against them: and this is\nwhat any one may continually see practised in many states. In the island\nof Cos, for instance, the democracy was subverted by the wickedness\nof the demagogues, for the nobles entered into a combination with\neach other. And at Rhodes the demagogues, by distributing of bribes,\nprevented the people from paying the trierarchs what was owing to them,\nwho were obliged by the number of actions they were harassed with to\nconspire together and destroy the popular state. The same thing was\nbrought about at Heraclea, soon after the settlement of the city, by\nthe same persons; for the citizens of note, being ill treated by them,\nquitted the city, but afterwards joining together they returned and\noverthrew the popular state. Just in the same manner the democracy\nwas destroyed in Megara; for there the demagogues, to procure money by\nconfiscations, drove out the nobles, till the number of those who were\nbanished was considerable, who, [1305a] returning, got the better of the\npeople in a battle, and established an oligarchy. The like happened at\nCume, during the time of the democracy, which Thrasymachus destroyed;\nand whoever considers what has happened in other states may perceive the\nsame revolutions to have arisen from the same causes. The demagogues,\nto curry favour with the people, drive the nobles to conspire together,\neither by dividing their estates, or obliging them to spend them on\npublic services, or by banishing them, that they may confiscate the\nfortunes of the wealthy. In former times, when the same person was both\ndemagogue and general, the democracies were changed into tyrannies; and\nindeed most of the ancient tyrannies arose from those states: a reason\nfor which then subsisted, but not now; for at that time the demagogues\nwere of the soldiery; for they were not then powerful by their\neloquence; but, now the art of oratory is cultivated, the able speakers\nare at present the demagogues; but, as they are unqualified to act in\na military capacity, they cannot impose themselves on the people as\ntyrants, if we except in one or two trifling instances. Formerly, too,\ntyrannies were more common than now, on account of the very extensive\npowers with which some magistrates were entrusted: as the prytanes at\nMiletus; for they were supreme in many things of the last consequence;\nand also because at that time the cities were not of that very great\nextent, the people in general living in the country, and being employed\nin husbandry, which gave them, who took the lead in public affairs, an\nopportunity, if they had a turn for war, to make themselves tyrants;\nwhich they all did when they had gained the confidence of the people;\nand this confidence was their hatred to the rich. This was the case of\nPisistratus at Athens, when he opposed the Pediaci: and of Theagenes in\nMegara, who slaughtered the cattle belonging to the rich, after he\nhad seized those who kept them by the riverside. Dionysius also, for\naccusing Daphnseus and the rich, was thought worthy of being raised to a\ntyranny, from the confidence which the people had of his being a popular\nman in consequence of these enmities. A government shall also alter from\nits ancient and approved democratic form into one entirely new, if\nthere is no census to regulate the election of magistrates; for, as the\nelection is with the people, the demagogues who are desirous of being in\noffice, to flatter them, will endeavour with all their power to make the\npeople superior even to the laws. To prevent this entirely, or at least\nin a great measure, the magistrates should be elected by the tribes, and\nnot by the people at large. These are nearly the revolutions to which\ndemocracies are liable, and also the causes from whence they arise.\nCHAPTER VI\nThere are two things which of all others most evidently occasion a\nrevolution in an oligarchy; one is, when the people are ill used, for\nthen every individual is ripe for [1305b] sedition; more particularly if\none of the oligarchy should happen to be their leader; as Lygdamis, at\nNaxus, who was afterwards tyrant of that island. Seditions also which\narise from different causes will differ from each other; for sometimes\na revolution is brought about by the rich who have no share in the\nadministration, which is in the hands of a very few indeed: and this\nhappened at Massilia, Ister, Heraclea, and other cities; for those who\nhad no share in the government ceased not to raise disputes till they\nwere admitted to it: first the elder brothers, and then the younger\nalso: for in some places the father and son are never in office at the\nsame time; in others the elder and younger brother: and where this is\nobserved the oligarchy partakes something of a free state. At Ister it\nwas changed into a democracy; in Heraclea, instead of being in the\nhands of a few, it consisted of six hundred. At Cnidus the oligarchy\nwas destroyed by the nobles quarrelling with each other, because the\ngovernment was in the hands of so few: for there, as we have just\nmentioned, if the father was in office, the son could not; or, if there\nwere many brothers, the eldest only; for the people, taking advantage of\ntheir disputes, elected one of the nobles for their general, and got the\nvictory: for where there are seditions government is weak. And formerly\nat Erithria, during the oligarchy of the Basilides, although the state\nflourished greatly under their excellent management, yet because the\npeople were displeased that the power should be in the hands of so\nfew, they changed the government. Oligarchies also are subject to\nrevolutions, from those who are in office therein, from the quarrels of\nthe demagogues with each other. The demagogues are of two sorts; one\nwho flatter the few when they are in power: for even these have their\ndemagogues; such was Charicles at Athens, who had great influence over\nthe thirty; and, in the same manner, Phrynichus over the four hundred.\nThe others are those demagogues who have a share in the oligarchy,\nand flatter the people: such were the state-guardians at Larissa, who\nflattered the people because they were elected by them. And this will\nalways happen in every oligarchy where the magistrates do not elect\nthemselves, but are chosen out of men either of great fortune or certain\nranks, by the soldiers or by the people; as was the custom at Abydos.\nAnd when the judicial department is not in the hands of the supreme\npower, the demagogues, favouring the people in their causes, overturn\nthe government; which happened at Heraclea in Pontus: and also when\nsome desire to contract the power of the oligarchy into fewer hands; for\nthose who endeavour to support an equality are obliged to apply to the\npeople for assistance. An oligarchy is also subject to revolutions\nwhen the nobility spend their fortunes by luxury; for such persons are\ndesirous of innovations, and either endeavour to be tyrants themselves\nor to support others in being so, as [1306a] Hypparinus supported\nDionysius of Syracuse. And at Amphipolis one Cleotimus collected a\ncolony of Chalcidians, and when they came set them to quarrel with\nthe rich: and at AEgina a certain person who brought an action against\nChares attempted on that account to alter the government. Sometimes they\nwill try to raise commotions, sometimes they will rob the public, and\nthen quarrel with each other, or else fight with those who endeavour\nto detect them; which was the case at Apollonia in Pontus. But if the\nmembers of an oligarchy agree among themselves the state is not very\neasily destroyed without some external force. Pharsalus is a proof of\nthis, where, though the place is small, yet the citizens have great\npower, from the prudent use they make of it. An oligarchy also will be\ndestroyed when they create another oligarchy under it; that is, when the\nmanagement of public affairs is in the hands of a few, and not equally,\nbut when all of them do not partake of the supreme power, as happened\nonce at Elis, where the supreme power in general was in the hands of a\nvery few out of whom a senate was chosen, consisting but of ninety, who\nheld their places for life; and their mode of election was calculated to\npreserve the power amongst each other's families, like the senators at\nLacedaemon. An oligarchy is liable to a revolution both in time of\nwar and peace; in war, because through a distrust in the citizens the\ngovernment is obliged to employ mercenary troops, and he to whom they\ngive the command of the army will very often assume the tyranny, as\nTimophanes did at Corinth; and if they appoint more than one general,\nthey will very probably establish a dynasty: and sometimes, through fear\nof this, they are forced to let the people in general have some share in\nthe government, because they are obliged to employ them. In peace,\nfrom their want of confidence in each other, they will entrust the\nguardianship of the state to mercenaries and their general, who will\nbe an arbiter between them, and sometimes become master of both, which\nhappened at Larissa, when Simos and the Aleuadae had the chief power.\nThe same thing happened at Abydos, during the time of the political\nclubs, of which Iphiades' was one. Commotions also will happen in an\noligarchy from one party's overbearing and insulting another, or\nfrom their quarrelling about their law-suits or marriages. How their\nmarriages, for instance, will have that effect has been already shown:\nand in Eretria, Diagoras destroyed the oligarchy of the knights upon the\nsame account. A sedition also arose at Heraclea, from a certain person\nbeing condemned by the court; and at Thebes, in consequence of a man's\nbeing guilty of adultery; [1306b] the punishment indeed which Eurytion\nsuffered at Heraclea was just, yet it was illegally executed: as was\nthat at Thebes upon Archias; for their enemies endeavoured to have them\npublicly bound in the pillory. Many revolutions also have been brought\nabout in oligarchies by those who could not brook the despotism which\nthose persons assumed who were in power, as at Cnidus and Chios. Changes\nalso may happen by accident in what we call a free state and in an\noligarchy; wheresoever the senators, judges, and magistrates are chosen\naccording to a certain census; for it often happens that the highest\ncensus is fixed at first; so that a few only could have a share in\nthe government, in an oligarchy, or in a free state those of moderate\nfortunes only; when the city grows rich, through peace or some other\nhappy cause, it becomes so little that every one's fortune is equal to\nthe census, so that the whole community may partake of all the honours\nof government; and this change sometimes happens by little and little,\nand insensible approaches, sometimes quicker. These are the revolutions\nand seditions that arise in oligarchies, and the causes to which they\nare owing: and indeed both democracies and oligarchies sometimes alter,\nnot into governments of a contrary form, but into those of the same\ngovernment; as, for instance, from having the supreme power in the law\nto vest it in the ruling party, or the contrariwise.\nCHAPTER VII\nCommotions also arise in aristocracies, from there being so few persons\nin power (as we have already observed they do in oligarchies, for in\nthis particular an aristocracy is most near an oligarchy, for in both\nthese states the administration of public affairs is in the hands of\na few; not that this arises from the same cause in both, though herein\nthey chiefly seem alike): and these will necessarily be most likely to\nhappen when the generality of the people are high-spirited and think\nthemselves equal to each other in merit; such were those at Lacedasmon,\ncalled the Partheniae (for these were, as well as others, descendants\nof citizens), who being detected in a conspiracy against the state, were\nsent to found Tarentum. They will happen also when some great men are\ndisgraced by those who have received higher honours than themselves, to\nwhom they are no ways inferior in abilities, as Lysander by the kings:\nor when an ambitious man cannot get into power, as Cinadon, who, in the\nreign of Agesilaus, was chief in a conspiracy against the Spartans:\nand also when some are too poor and others too rich, which will most\nfrequently happen in time of war; as at Lacedaemon during the Messenian\nwar, which is proved by a poem of Tyrtaeus, [1307a] called \"Eunomia;\"\nfor some persons being reduced thereby, desired that the lands might\nbe divided: and also when some person of very high rank might still be\nhigher if he could rule alone, which seemed to be Pausanias's intention\nat Lacedaemon, when he was their general in the Median war, and Anno's\nat Carthage. But free states and aristocracies are mostly destroyed from\nwant of a fixed administration of public affairs; the cause of which\nevil arises at first from want of a due mixture of the democratic and\nthe oligarchic parts in a free state; and in an aristocracy from the\nsame causes, and also from virtue not being properly joined to power;\nbut chiefly from the two first, I mean the undue mixture of the\ndemocratic and oligarchic parts; for these two are what all free\nstates endeavour to blend together, and many of those which we call\naristocracies, in this particular these states differ from each other,\nand on this account the one of them is less stable than the other, for\nthat state which inclines most to an oligarchy is called an aristocracy,\nand that which inclines most to a democracy is called a free state; on\nwhich account this latter is more secure than the former, for the wider\nthe foundation the securer the building, and it is ever best to live\nwhere equality prevails. But the rich, if the community gives them rank,\nvery often endeavour to insult and tyrannise over others. On the whole,\nwhichever way a government inclines, in that it will settle, each party\nsupporting their own. Thus a free state will become a democracy; an\naristocracy an oligarchy; or the contrary, an aristocracy may change\ninto a democracy (for the poor, if they think themselves injured,\ndirectly take part with the contrary side) and a free state into an\noligarchy. The only firm state is that where every one enjoys that\nequality he has a right to and fully possesses what is his own. And what\nI have been speaking of happened to the Thurians; for the magistrates\nbeing elected according to a very high census, it was altered to a\nlower, and they were subdivided into more courts, but in consequence of\nthe nobles possessing all the land, contrary to law; the state was too\nmuch of an oligarchy, which gave them an opportunity of encroaching\ngreatly on the rest of the people; but these, after they had been well\ninured to war, so far got the better of their guards as to expel every\none out of the country who possessed more than he ought. Moreover, as\nall aristocracies are free oligarchies, the nobles therein endeavour to\nhave rather too much power, as at Lacedaemon, where property is now in\nthe hands of a few, and the nobles have too much liberty to do as they\nplease and make such alliances as they please. Thus the city of the\nLocrians was ruined from an alliance with Dionysius; which state was\nneither a democracy nor well-tempered aristocracy. But an aristocracy\nchiefly approaches to a secret change by its being destroyed by degrees,\nas we [1307b] have already said of all governments in general; and this\nhappens from the cause of the alteration being trifling; for whenever\nanything which in the least regards the state is treated with contempt,\nafter that something else, and this of a little more consequence, will\nbe more easily altered, until the whole fabric of government is entirely\nsubverted, which happened in the government of Thurium; for the law\nbeing that they should continue soldiers for five years, some young\nmen of a martial disposition, who were in great esteem amongst their\nofficers, despising those who had the management of public affairs,\nand imagining they could easily accomplish their intention, first\nendeavoured to abolish this law, with a view of having it lawful to\ncontinue the same person perpetually in the military, perceiving that\nthe people would readily appoint them. Upon this, the magistrates who\nare called counselors first joined together with an intention to oppose\nit but were afterwards induced to agree to it, from a belief that if\nthat law was not repealed they would permit the management of all other\npublic affairs to remain in their hands; but afterwards, when they\nendeavoured to restrain some fresh alterations that were making, they\nfound that they could do nothing, for the whole form of government was\naltered into a dynasty of those who first introduced the innovations. In\nshort, all governments are liable to be destroyed either from within or\nfrom without; from without when they have for their neighbour a state\nwhose policy is contrary to theirs, and indeed if it has great power the\nsame thing will happen if it is not their neighbour; of which both\nthe Athenians and the Lacedaemonians are a proof; for the one,\nwhen conquerors everywhere destroyed the oligarchies; the other the\ndemocracies. These are the chief causes of revolutions and dissensions\nin governments.\nCHAPTER VIII\nWe are now to consider upon what the preservation of governments in\ngeneral and of each state in particular depends; and, in the first\nplace, it is evident that if we are right in the causes we have assigned\nfor their destruction, we know also the means of their preservation; for\nthings contrary produce contraries: but destruction and preservation are\ncontrary to each other. In well-tempered governments it requires as much\ncare as anything whatsoever, that nothing be done contrary to law: and\nthis ought chiefly to be attended to in matters of small consequence;\nfor an illegality that approaches insensibly, approaches secretly, as in\na family small expenses continually repeated consume a man's income;\nfor the understanding is deceived thereby, as by this false argument; if\nevery part is little, then the whole is little: now, this in one sense\nis true, in another is false, for the whole and all the parts together\nare large, though made up of small parts. The first therefore of\nanything is what the state ought to guard against. In the next place,\nno credit ought to be given to those who endeavour to deceive the people\nwith false pretences; for they will be [1308a] confuted by facts. The\ndifferent ways in which they will attempt to do this have been already\nmentioned. You may often perceive both aristocracies and oligarchies\ncontinuing firm, not from the stability of their forms of government,\nbut from the wise conduct of the magistrates, both towards those who\nhave a part in the management of public affairs, and those also who\nhave not: towards those who have not, by never injuring them; and also\nintroducing those who are of most consequence amongst them into office;\nnor disgracing those who are desirous of honour; or encroaching on the\nproperty of individuals; towards those who have, by behaving to each\nother upon an equality; for that equality which the favourers of a\ndemocracy desire to have established in the state is not only just,\nbut convenient also, amongst those who are of the same rank: for which\nreason, if the administration is in the hands of many, those rules which\nare established in democracies will be very useful; as to let no one\ncontinue in office longer than six months: that all those who are of\nthe same rank may have their turn; for between these there is a sort\nof democracy: for which reason demagogues are most likely to arise up\namongst them, as we have already mentioned: besides, by this means both\naristocracies and democracies will be the less liable to be corrupted\ninto dynasties, because it will not be so easy for those who are\nmagistrates for a little to do as much mischief as they could in a\nlong time: for it is from hence that tyrannies arise in democracies\nand oligarchies; for either those who are most powerful in each state\nestablish a tyranny, as the demagogues in the one, the dynasties in the\nother, or the chief magistrates who have been long in power. Governments\nare sometimes preserved not only by having the means of their corruption\nat a great distance, but also by its being very near them; for those who\nare alarmed at some impending evil keep a stricter hand over the state;\nfor which reason it is necessary for those who have the guardianship of\nthe constitution to be able to awaken the fears of the people, that they\nmay preserve it, and not like a night-guard to be remiss in protecting\nthe state, but to make the distant danger appear at hand. Great care\nought also to be used to endeavour to restrain the quarrels and disputes\nof the nobles by laws, as well as to prevent those who are not already\nengaged in them from taking a part therein; for to perceive an evil\nat its very first approach is not the lot of every one, but of the\npolitician. To prevent any alteration taking place in an oligarchy or\nfree state on account of the census, if that happens to continue the\nsame while the quantity of money is increased, it will be useful to take\na general account of the whole amount of it in former times, to compare\nit with the present, and to do this every year in those cities where the\ncensus is yearly, [1308b] in larger communities once in three or five\nyears; and if the whole should be found much larger or much less than it\nwas at the time when the census was first established in the state,\nlet there be a law either to extend or contract it, doing both these\naccording to its increase or decrease; if it increases making the census\nlarger, if it decreases smaller: and if this latter is not done in\noligarchies and free states, you will have a dynasty arise in the one,\nan oligarchy in the other: if the former is not, free states will\nbe changed into democracies, and oligarchies into free states or\ndemocracies. It is a general maxim in democracies, oligarchies,\nmonarchies, and indeed in all governments, not to let any one acquire a\nrank far superior to the rest of the community, but rather to endeavour\nto confer moderate honours for a continuance than great ones for a short\ntime; for these latter spoil men, for it is not every one who can bear\nprosperity: but if this rule is not observed, let not those honours\nwhich were conferred all at once be all at once taken away, but rather\nby degrees. But, above all things, let this regulation be made by the\nlaw, that no one shall have too much power, either by means of his\nfortune or friends; but if he has, for his excess therein, let it be\ncontrived that he shall quit the country. Now, as many persons promote\ninnovations, that they may enjoy their own particular manner of living,\nthere ought to be a particular officer to inspect the manners of every\none, and see that these are not contrary to the genius of the state\nin which he lives, whether it may be an oligarchy, a democracy, or any\nother form of government; and, for the same reason, those should be\nguarded against who are most prosperous in the city: the means of doing\nwhich is by appointing those who are otherwise to the business and the\noffices of the state. I mean, to oppose men of account to the common\npeople, the poor to the rich, and to blend both these into one body, and\nto increase the numbers of those who are in the middle rank; and\nthis will prevent those seditions which arise from an inequality of\ncondition. But above all, in every state it is necessary, both by the\nlaws and every other method possible, to prevent those who are employed\nby the public from being venal, and this particularly in an oligarchy;\nfor then the people will not be so much displeased from seeing\nthemselves excluded from a share in the government (nay, they will\nrather be glad to have leisure to attend their private affairs) as at\nsuspecting that the officers of the state steal the public money, then\nindeed they are afflicted with double concern, both because they are\ndeprived of the honours of the state, and pillaged by those who enjoy\nthem. There is one method of blending together a democracy and an\naristocracy, [1309a] if office brought no profit; by which means both\nthe rich and the poor will enjoy what they desire; for to admit all to\na share in the government is democratical; that the rich should be\nin office is aristocratical. This must be done by letting no public\nemployment whatsoever be attended with any emolument; for the poor will\nnot desire to be in office when they can get nothing by it, but had\nrather attend to their own affairs: but the rich will choose it, as\nthey want nothing of the community. Thus the poor will increase their\nfortunes by being wholly employed in their own concerns; and the\nprincipal part of the people will not be governed by the lower sort.\nTo prevent the exchequer from being defrauded, let all public money be\ndelivered out openly in the face of the whole city, and let copies of\nthe accounts be deposited in the different wards tribes, and divisions.\nBut, as the magistrates are to execute their offices without any\nadvantages, the law ought to provide proper honours for those who\nexecute them well. In democracies also it is necessary that the rich\nshould be protected, by not permitting their lands to be divided, nor\neven the produce of them, which in some states is done unperceivably. It\nwould be also better if the people would prevent them when they offer to\nexhibit a number of unnecessary and yet expensive public entertainments\nof plays, music, processions, and the like. In an oligarchy it is\nnecessary to take great care of the poor, and allot them public\nemployments which are gainful; and, if any of the rich insult them, to\nlet their punishment be severer than if they insulted one of their own\nrank; and to let estates pass by affinity, and not gift: nor to permit\nany person to have more than one; for by this means property will be\nmore equally divided, and the greater part of the poor get into better\ncircumstances. It is also serviceable in a democracy and an oligarchy\nto allot those who take no part in public affairs an equality or a\npreference in other things; the rich in a democracy, to the poor in an\noligarchy: but still all the principal offices in the state to be filled\nonly by those who are best qualified to discharge them.\nCHAPTER IX\nThere are three qualifications necessary for those who fill the\nfirst departments in government; first of all, an affection for the\nestablished constitution; second place, abilities every way completely\nequal to the business of their office; in the third, virtue and justice\ncorrespondent to the nature of that particular state they are placed in;\nfor if justice is not the same in all states, it is evident that there\nmust be different species thereof. There may be some doubt, when all\nthese qualifications do not in the same persons, in what manner the\nchoice shall be made; as for instance, suppose that one person is\nan accomplished general, but a bad man and no friend to the [1309b]\nconstitution; another is just and a friend to it, which shall one\nprefer? we should then consider of two qualities, which of them the\ngenerality possess in a greater degree, which in a less; for which\nreason in the choice of a general we should regard his courage more than\nhis virtue as the more uncommon quality; as there are fewer capable of\nconducting an army than there are good men: but, to protect the state\nor manage the finances, the contrary rule should be followed; for these\nrequire greater virtue than the generality are possessed of, but only\nthat knowledge which is common to all. It may be asked, if a man has\nabilities equal to his appointment in the state, and is affectionate to\nthe constitution, what occasion is there for being virtuous, since\nthese two things alone are sufficient to enable him to be useful to\nthe public? it is, because those who possess those qualities are often\ndeficient in prudence; for, as they often neglect their own affairs,\nthough they know them and love themselves, so nothing will prevent their\nserving the public in the same manner. In short, whatsoever the laws\ncontain which we allow to be useful to the state contributes to its\npreservation: but its first and principal support is (as has been often\ninsisted upon) to have the number of those who desire to preserve it\ngreater than those who wish to destroy it. Above all things that ought\nnot to be forgotten which many governments now corrupted neglect;\nnamely, to preserve a mean. For many things seemingly favourable to a\ndemocracy destroy a democracy, and many things seemingly favourable to\nan oligarchy destroy an oligarchy. Those who think this the only virtue\nextend it to excess, not considering that as a nose which varies a\nlittle from perfect straightness, either towards a hook nose or a\nflat one, may yet be beautiful and agreeable to look at; but if this\nparticularity is extended beyond measure, first of all the properties of\nthe part is lost, but at last it can hardly be admitted to be a nose at\nall, on account of the excess of the rise or sinking: thus it is with\nother parts of the human body; so also the same thing is true with\nrespect to states; for both an oligarchy and a democracy may something\nvary from their most perfect form and yet be well constituted; but if\nany one endeavours to extend either of them too far, at first he will\nmake the government the worse for it, but at last there will be no\ngovernment at all remaining. The lawgiver and the politician therefore\nshould know well what preserves and what destroys a democracy or an\noligarchy, for neither the one nor the other can possibly continue\nwithout rich and poor: but that whenever an entire equality of\ncircumstances [1310a] prevails, the state must necessarily become of\nanother form; so that those who destroy these laws, which authorise an\ninequality in property, destroy the government. It is also an error in\ndemocracies for the demagogues to endeavour to make the common people\nsuperior to the laws; and thus by setting them at variance with the\nrich, dividing one city into two; whereas they ought rather to speak\nin favour of the rich. In oligarchies, on the contrary, it is wrong to\nsupport those who are in administration against the people. The oaths\nalso which they take in an oligarchy ought to be contrary to what they\nnow are; for, at present, in some places they swear, \"I will be adverse\nto the common people, and contrive all I can against them;\" whereas they\nought rather to suppose and pretend the contrary; expressing in their\noaths, that they will not injure the people. But of all things which I\nhave mentioned, that which contributes most to preserve the state is,\nwhat is now most despised, to educate your children for the state; for\nthe most useful laws, and most approved by every statesman, will be of\nno service if the citizens are not accustomed to and brought up in\nthe principles of the constitution; of a democracy, if that is by law\nestablished; of an oligarchy, if that is; for if there are bad morals\nin one man, there are in the city. But to educate a child fit for the\nstate, it must not be done in the manner which would please either those\nwho have the power in an oligarchy or those who desire a democracy, but\nso as they may be able to conduct either of these forms of governments.\nBut now the children of the magistrates in an oligarchy are brought up\ntoo delicately, and the children of the poor hardy with exercise\nand labour; so that they are both desirous of and able to promote\ninnovations. In democracies of the purest form they pursue a method\nwhich is contrary to their welfare; the reason of which is, that they\ndefine liberty wrong: now, there are two things which seem to be the\nobjects of a democracy, that the people in general should possess the\nsupreme power, and all enjoy freedom; for that which is just seems to\nbe equal, and what the people think equal, that is a law: now, their\nfreedom and equality consists in every one's doing what they please:\nthat is in such a democracy every one may live as he likes; \"as his\ninclination guides,\" in the words of Euripides: but this is wrong, for\nno one ought to think it slavery to live in subjection to government,\nbut protection. Thus I have mentioned the causes of corruption in\ndifferent states, and the means of their preservation.\nCHAPTER X\nIt now remains that we speak of monarchies, their causes of corruption,\nand means of preservation; and indeed almost the same things which have\nbeen said of other governments happen to kingdoms and tyrannies; for a\nkingdom partakes of an aristocracy, a tyranny of the worst species of an\noligarchy and democracy; for which reason it is the worst that man\ncan submit to, as being composed of two, both of which are bad, and\ncollectively retains all the corruptions and all the defects of both\nthese states. These two species of monarchies arise from principles\ncontrary to each other: a kingdom is formed to protect the better sort\nof people against the multitude, and kings are appointed out of those,\nwho are chosen either for their superior virtue and actions flowing from\nvirtuous principles, or else from their noble descent; but a tyrant is\nchosen out of the meanest populace; an enemy to the better sort, that\nthe common people may not be oppressed by them. That this is true\nexperience convinces us; for the generality of tyrants were indeed mere\ndemagogues, who gained credit with the people by oppressing the nobles.\nSome tyrannies were established in this manner after the cities were\nconsiderably enlarged--others before that time, by kings who exceeded\nthe power which their country allowed them, from a desire of governing\ndespotically: others were founded by those who were elected to the\nsuperior offices in the state; for formerly the people appointed\nofficers for life, who came to be at the head of civil and religious\naffairs, and these chose one out of their body in whom the supreme power\nover all the magistrates was placed. By all these means it was easy\nto establish a tyranny, if they chose it; for their power was ready at\nhand, either by their being kings, or else by enjoying the honours of\nthe state; thus Phidon at Argos and other tyrants enjoyed originally the\nkingly power; Phalaris and others in Ionia, the honours of the state.\nPansetius at Leontium, Cypselus at Corinth, Pisistratus at Athens,\nDionysius at Syracuse, and others, acquired theirs by having been\ndemagogues. A kingdom, as we have said, partakes much of the nature of\nan aristocracy, and is bestowed according to worth, as either virtue,\nfamily, beneficent actions, or these joined with power; for those who\nhave been benefactors to cities and states, or have it in their powers\nto be so, have acquired this honour, and those who have prevented a\npeople from falling into slavery by war, as Codrus, or those who have\nfreed them from it, as Cyrus, or the founders of cities, or settlers of\ncolonies, as the kings of Sparta, Macedon, and Molossus. A king desires\nto be the guardian of his people, that those who have property may be\nsecure in the possession of it, and that the people in general meet with\nno injury; but a tyrant, as has been often said, has no regard to the\ncommon good, except for his own advantage; his only object is pleasure,\nbut a king's is virtue: what a tyrant therefore is ambitious of\nengrossing is wealth, but a king rather honour. The guards too of a king\nare citizens, a tyrant's foreigners.\nThat a tyranny contains all that is bad both in a democracy and an\noligarchy is evident; with an oligarchy it has for its end gain, as the\nonly means of providing the tyrant with guards and the luxuries of life;\nlike that it places no confidence in the people; and therefore deprives\nthem of the use of arms: it is also common to them both to persecute the\npopulace, to drive them out of the city and their own habitations. With\na democracy it quarrels with the nobles, and destroys them both\npublicly and privately, or drives them into banishment, as rivals and\nan impediment to the government; hence naturally arise conspiracies\nboth amongst those who desire to govern and those who desire not to be\nslaves; hence arose Periander's advice to Thrasybulus to take off the\ntallest stalks, hinting thereby, that it was necessary to make away with\nthe eminent citizens. We ought then in reason, as has been already\nsaid, to account for the changes which arise in a monarchy from the\nsame causes which produce them in other states: for, through injustice\nreceived, fear, and contempt, many of those who are under a monarchical\ngovernment conspire against it; but of all species of injustice,\ninjurious contempt has most influence on them for that purpose:\nsometimes it is owing to their being deprived of their private fortunes.\nThe dissolution too of a kingdom and a tyranny are generally the same;\nfor monarchs abound in wealth and honour, which all are desirous to\nobtain. Of plots: some aim at the life of those who govern, others at\ntheir government; the first arises from hatred to their persons; which\nhatred may be owing to many causes, either of which will be sufficient\nto excite their anger, and the generality of those who are under the\ninfluence of that passion will join in a conspiracy, not for the sake\nof their own advancement, but for revenge. Thus the plot against\nthe children of Pisistratus arose from their injurious treatment of\nHarmodius's sister, and insulting him also; for Harmodius resenting the\ninjury done to his sister, and Aristogiton the injury done to Harmodius.\nPeriander the tyrant of Ambracia also lost his life by a conspiracy, for\nsome improper liberties he took with a boy in his cups: and Philip was\nslain by Pausanias for neglecting to revenge him of the affront he had\nreceived from Attains; as was Amintas the Little by Darda, for insulting\nhim on account of his age; and the eunuch by Evagoras the Cyprian in\nrevenge for having taken his son's wife away from him....\nMany also who have had their bodies scourged with stripes have, through\nresentment, either killed those who caused them to be inflicted or\nconspired against them, even when they had kingly power, as at Mitylene\nMegacles, joining with his friends, killed the Penthelidee, who used\nto go about striking those they met with clubs. Thus, in later times,\nSmendes killed Penthilus for whipping him and dragging him away from\nhis wife. Decamnichus also was the chief cause of the conspiracy against\nArchelaus, for he urged others on: the occasion of his resentment was\nhis having delivered him to Euripides the poet to be scourged; for\nEuripides was greatly offended with him for having said something of the\nfoulness of his breath. And many others have been killed or conspired\nagainst on the same account. Fear too is a cause which produces the\nsame effects, as well in monarchies as in other states: thus Artabanes\nconspired against Xerxes through fear of punishment for having hanged\nDarius according to his orders, whom he supposed he intended to pardon,\nas the order was given at supper-time. Some kings also have been [1312a]\ndethroned and killed in consequence of the contempt they were held in by\nthe people; as some one conspired against Sardanapalus, having seen him\nspinning with his wife, if what is related of him is true, or if not of\nhim, it may very probably be true of some one else. Dion also conspired\nagainst Dionysius the Younger, seeing his subjects desirous of a\nconspiracy, and that he himself was always drunk: and even a man's\nfriends will do this if they despise him; for from the confidence he\nplaces in them, they think that they shall not be found out. Those\nalso who think they shall gain his throne will conspire against a king\nthrough contempt; for as they are powerful themselves, and despise the\ndanger, on account of their own strength, they will readily attempt it.\nThus a general at the head of his army will endeavour to dethrone the\nmonarch, as Cyrus did Astyages, despising both his manner of life and\nhis forces; his forces for want of action, his life for its effeminacy:\nthus Suthes, the Thracian, who was general to Amadocus, conspired\nagainst him. Sometimes more than one of these causes will excite men\nto enter into conspiracies, as contempt and desire of gain; as in the\ninstance of Mithridates against Ariobarzanes. Those also who are of a\nbold disposition, and have gained military honours amongst kings, will\nof all others be most like to engage in sedition; for strength and\ncourage united inspire great bravery: whenever, therefore, these join\nin one person, he will be very ready for conspiracies, as he will easily\nconquer. Those who conspire against a tyrant through love of glory\nand honour have a different motive in view from what I have already\nmentioned; for, like all others who embrace danger, they have only glory\nand honour in view, and think, not as some do, of the wealth and pomp\nthey may acquire, but engage in this as they would in any other noble\naction, that they may be illustrious and distinguished, and destroy a\ntyrant, not to succeed in his tyranny, but to acquire renown. No doubt\nbut the number of those who act upon this principle is small, for we\nmust suppose they regard their own safety as nothing in case they should\nnot succeed, and must embrace the opinion of Dion (which few can do)\nwhen he made war upon Dionysius with a very few troops; for he said,\nthat let the advantage he made be ever so little it would satisfy him to\nhave gained it; and that, should it be his lot to die the moment he had\ngained footing in his country, he should think his death sufficiently\nglorious. A tyranny also is exposed to the same destruction as all other\nstates are, from too powerful neighbours: for it is evident, that an\nopposition of principles will make them desirous of subverting it;\nand what they desire, all who can, do: and there is a principle of\nopposition in one state to another, as a democracy against a tyranny, as\nsays Hesiod, \"a potter against a potter;\" for the extreme of a democracy\nis a tyranny; a kingly power against an aristocracy, from their\ndifferent forms of government--for which reason the Lacedaemonians\ndestroyed many tyrannies; as did the Syracusians during the prosperity\nof their state. Nor are they only destroyed from without, but also\nfrom within, when those who have no share in the power bring about a\nrevolution, as happened to Gelon, and lately to Dionysius; to the first,\nby means of Thrasybulus, the brother of Hiero, who nattered Gelon's\nson, and induced him to lead a life of pleasure, that he himself might\ngovern; but the family joined together and endeavoured to support the\ntyranny and expel Thrasybulus; but those whom they made of their party\nseized the opportunity and expelled the whole family. Dion made war\nagainst his relation Dionysius, and being assisted by the people, first\nexpelled and then killed him. As there are two causes which chiefly\ninduce men to conspire against tyrants, hatred and contempt, one of\nthese, namely hatred, seems inseparable from them. Contempt also is\noften the cause of their destruction: for though, for instance, those\nwho raised themselves to the supreme power generally preserved it; but\nthose who received it from them have, to speak truth, almost immediately\nall of them lost it; for, falling into an effeminate way of life, they\nsoon grew despicable, and generally fell victims to conspiracies. Part\nof their hatred may be very fitly ascribed to anger; for in some cases\nthis is their motive to action: for it is often a cause which impels\nthem to act more powerfully than hatred, and they proceed with greater\nobstinacy against those whom they attack, as this passion is not under\nthe direction of reason. Many persons also indulge this passion through\ncontempt; which occasioned the fall of the Pisistratidae and many\nothers. But hatred is more powerful than anger; for anger is accompanied\nwith grief, which prevents the entrance of reason; but hatred is free\nfrom it. In short, whatever causes may be assigned as the destruction\nof a pure oligarchy unmixed with any other government and an extreme\ndemocracy, the same may be applied to a tyranny; for these are divided\ntyrannies.\nKingdoms are seldom destroyed by any outward attack; for which reason\nthey are generally very stable; but they have many causes of subversion\nwithin; of which two are the principal; one is when those who are\nin power [1313a] excite a sedition, the other when they endeavour to\nestablish a tyranny by assuming greater power than the law gives them.\nA kingdom, indeed, is not what we ever see erected in our times, but\nrather monarchies and tyrannies; for a kingly government is one that\nis voluntarily submitted to, and its supreme power admitted upon great\noccasions: but where many are equal, and there are none in any respect\nso much better than another as to be qualified for the greatness and\ndignity of government over them, then these equals will not willingly\nsubmit to be commanded; but if any one assumes the government, either by\nforce or fraud, this is a tyranny. To what we have already said we shall\nadd, the causes of revolutions in an hereditary kingdom. One of these\nis, that many of those who enjoy it are naturally proper objects of\ncontempt only: another is, that they are insolent while their power is\nnot despotic; but they possess kingly honours only. Such a state is soon\ndestroyed; for a king exists but while the people are willing to obey,\nas their submission to him is voluntary, but to a tyrant involuntary.\nThese and such-like are the causes of the destruction of monarchies.\nCHAPTER XI\nMonarchies, in a word, are preserved by means contrary to what I have\nalready mentioned as the cause of their destruction; but to speak to\neach separately: the stability of a kingdom will depend upon the power\nof the king's being kept within moderate bounds; for by how much the\nless extensive his power is, by so much the longer will his government\ncontinue; for he will be less despotic and more upon an equality of\ncondition with those he governs; who, on that account, will envy him the\nless.\nIt was on this account that the kingdom of the Molossi continued so\nlong; and the Lacedaemonians from their government's being from the\nbeginning divided into two parts, and also by the moderation introduced\ninto the other parts of it by Theopompus, and his establishment of the\nephori; for by taking something from the power he increased the duration\nof the kingdom, so that in some measure he made it not less, but bigger;\nas they say he replied to his wife, who asked him if he was not ashamed\nto deliver down his kingdom to his children reduced from what he\nreceived it from his ancestors? No, says he, I give it him more lasting.\nTyrannies are preserved two ways most opposite to each other, one of\nwhich is when the power is delegated from one to the other, and in this\nmanner many tyrants govern in their states. Report says that Periander\nfounded many of these. There are also many of them to be met with\namongst the Persians. What has been already mentioned is as conducive\nas anything can be to preserve a tyranny; namely, to keep down those who\nare of an aspiring disposition, to take off those who will not submit,\nto allow no public meals, no clubs, no education, nothing at all, but\nto guard against everything that gives rise to high spirits or mutual\nconfidence; nor to suffer the learned meetings of those who are at\nleisure to hold conversation with each other; and to endeavour by every\nmeans possible to keep all the people strangers to each other; for\nknowledge increases mutual confidence; and to oblige all strangers to\nappear in public, and to live near the city-gate, that all their actions\nmay be sufficiently seen; for those who are kept like slaves seldom\nentertain any noble thoughts: in short, to imitate everything which the\nPersians and barbarians do, for they all contribute to support slavery;\nand to endeavour to know what every one who is under their power does\nand says; and for this purpose to employ spies: such were those women\nwhom the Syracusians called potagogides Hiero also used to send out\nlisteners wherever there was any meeting or conversation; for the people\ndare not speak with freedom for fear of such persons; and if any one\ndoes, there is the less chance of its being concealed; and to endeavour\nthat the whole community should mutually accuse and come to blows with\neach other, friend with friend, the commons with the nobles, and the\nrich with each other. It is also advantageous for a tyranny that all\nthose who are under it should be oppressed with poverty, that they may\nnot be able to compose a guard; and that, being employed in procuring\ntheir daily bread, they may have no leisure to conspire against their\ntyrants. The Pyramids of Egypt are a proof of this, and the votive\nedifices of the Cyposelidse, and the temple of Jupiter Olympus, built by\nthe Pisistratidae, and the works of Polycrates at Samos; for all these\nproduced one end, the keeping the people poor. It is necessary also to\nmultiply taxes, as at Syracuse; where Dionysius in the space of five\nyears collected all the private property of his subjects into his own\ncoffers. A tyrant also should endeavour to engage his subjects in a war,\nthat they may have employment and continually depend upon their general.\nA king is preserved by his friends, but a tyrant is of all persons the\nman who can place no confidence in friends, as every one has it in his\ndesire and these chiefly in their power to destroy him. All these things\nalso which are done in an extreme democracy should be done in a tyranny,\nas permitting great licentiousness to the women in the house, that they\nmay reveal their husbands' secrets; and showing great indulgence to\nslaves also for the same reason; for slaves and women conspire not\nagainst tyrants: but when they are treated with kindness, both of them\nare abettors of tyrants, and extreme democracies also; and the people\ntoo in such a state desire to be despotic. For which reason flatterers\nare in repute in both these: the demagogue in the democracy, for he is\nthe proper flatterer of the people; among tyrants, he who will servilely\nadapt himself to their humours; for this is the business of [1314a]\nflatterers. And for this reason tyrants always love the worst of\nwretches, for they rejoice in being flattered, which no man of a liberal\nspirit will submit to; for they love the virtuous, but flatter none. Bad\nmen too are fit for bad purposes; \"like to like,\" as the proverb says. A\ntyrant also should show no favour to a man of worth or a freeman; for he\nshould think, that no one deserved to be thought these but himself; for\nhe who supports his dignity, and is a friend to freedom, encroaches upon\nthe superiority and the despotism of the tyrant: such men, therefore,\nthey naturally hate, as destructive to their government. A tyrant\nalso should rather admit strangers to his table and familiarity than\ncitizens, as these are his enemies, but the others have no design\nagainst him. These and such-like are the supports of a tyranny, for\nit comprehends whatsoever is wicked. But all these things may be\ncomprehended in three divisions, for there are three objects which a\ntyranny has in view; one of which is, that the citizens should be of\npoor abject dispositions; for such men never propose to conspire against\nany one. The second is, that they should have no confidence in each\nother; for while they have not this, the tyrant is safe enough from\ndestruction. For which reason they are always at enmity with those of\nmerit, as hurtful to their government; not only as they scorn to be\ngoverned despotically, but also because they can rely upon each other's\nfidelity, and others can rely upon theirs, and because they will not\ninform against their associates, nor any one else. The third is, that\nthey shall be totally without the means of doing anything; for no one\nundertakes what is impossible for him to perform: so that without power\na tyranny can never be destroyed. These, then, are the three objects\nwhich the inclinations of tyrants desire to see accomplished; for all\ntheir tyrannical plans tend to promote one of these three ends, that\ntheir people may neither have mutual confidence, power, nor spirit.\nThis, then, is one of the two methods of preserving tyrannies: the other\nproceeds in a way quite contrary to what has been already described,\nand which may be discerned from considering to what the destruction of\na kingdom is owing; for as one cause of that is, making the government\napproach near to a tyranny, so the safety of a tyranny consists in\nmaking the government nearly kingly; preserving only one thing, namely\npower, that not only the willing, but the unwilling also, must be\nobliged to submit; for if this is once lost, the tyranny is at an end.\nThis, then, as the foundation, must be preserved: in other particulars\ncarefully do and affect to seem like a king; first, appear to pay a\ngreat attention [1314b] to what belongs to the public; nor make such\nprofuse presents as will offend the people; while they are to supply\nthe money out of the hard labour of their own hands, and see it given\nin profusion to mistresses, foreigners, and fiddlers; keeping an exact\naccount both of what you receive and pay; which is a practice some\ntyrants do actually follow, by which means they seem rather fathers of\nfamilies than tyrants: nor need you ever fear the want of money while\nyou have the supreme power of the state in your own hands. It is also\nmuch better for those tyrants who quit their kingdom to do this than to\nleave behind them money they have hoarded up; for their regents will\nbe much less desirous of making innovations, and they are more to be\ndreaded by absent tyrants than the citizens; for such of them as he\nsuspects he takes with him, but these regents must be left behind. He\nshould also endeavour to appear to collect such taxes and require such\nservices as the exigencies of the state demand, that whenever they are\nwanted they may be ready in time of war; and particularly to take care\nthat he appear to collect and keep them not as his own property, but the\npublic's. His appearance also should not be severe, but respectable, so\nthat he should inspire those who approach him with veneration and not\nfear; but this will not be easily accomplished if he is despised. If,\ntherefore, he will not take the pains to acquire any other, he ought to\nendeavour to be a man of political abilities, and to fix that opinion of\nhimself in the judgment of his subjects. He should also take care not to\nappear to be guilty of the least offence against modesty, nor to suffer\nit in those under him: nor to permit the women of his family to treat\nothers haughtily; for the haughtiness of women has been the ruin of many\ntyrants. With respect to the pleasures of sense, he ought to do directly\ncontrary to the practice of some tyrants at present; for they do not\nonly continually indulge themselves in them for many days together, but\nthey seem also to desire to have other witnesses of it, that they may\nwonder at their happiness; whereas he ought really to be moderate in\nthese, and, if not, to appear to others to avoid them-for it is not the\nsober man who is exposed either to plots or contempt, but the drunkard;\nnot the early riser, but the sluggard. His conduct in general should\nalso be contrary to what is reported of former tyrants; for he ought to\nimprove and adorn his city, so as to seem a guardian and not a tyrant;\nand, moreover., always to [1315a] seem particularly attentive to the\nworship of the gods; for from persons of such a character men entertain\nless fears of suffering anything illegal while they suppose that he who\ngoverns them is religious and reverences the gods; and they will be less\ninclined to raise insinuations against such a one, as being peculiarly\nunder their protection: but this must be so done as to give no occasion\nfor any suspicion of hypocrisy. He should also take care to show such\nrespect to men of merit in every particular, that they should not think\nthey could be treated with greater distinction by their fellow-citizens\nin a free state. He should also let all honours flow immediately from\nhimself, but every censure from his subordinate officers and judges. It\nis also a common protection of all monarchies not to make one person too\ngreat, or, certainly, not many; for they will support each other: but,\nif it is necessary to entrust any large powers to one person, to take\ncare that it is not one of an ardent spirit; for this disposition is\nupon every opportunity most ready for a revolution: and, if it should\nseem necessary to deprive any one of his power, to do it by degrees,\nand not reduce him all at once. It is also necessary to abstain from all\nkinds of insolence; more particularly from corporal punishment; which\nyou must be most cautious never to exercise over those who have a\ndelicate sense of honour; for, as those who love money are touched to\nthe quick when anything affects their property, so are men of honour and\nprinciple when they receive any disgrace: therefore, either never employ\npersonal punishment, or, if you do, let it be only in the manner in\nwhich a father would correct his son, and not with contempt; and, upon\nthe whole, make amends for any seeming disgrace by bestowing greater\nhonours. But of all persons who are most likely to entertain designs\nagainst the person of a tyrant, those are chiefly to be feared and\nguarded against who regard as nothing the loss of their own lives, so\nthat they can but accomplish their purpose: be very careful therefore\nof those who either think themselves affronted, or those who are dear\nto them; for those who are excited by anger to revenge regard as nothing\ntheir own persons: for, as Heraclitus says, it is dangerous to fight\nwith an angry man who will purchase with his life the thing he aims at.\nAs all cities are composed of two sorts of persons, the rich and the\npoor, it is necessary that both these should find equal protection from\nhim who governs them, and that the one party should not have it in their\npower to injure the other; but that the tyrant should attach to himself\nthat party which is the most powerful; which, if he does, he will have\nno occasion either to make his slaves free, or to deprive citizens of\ntheir arms; for the strength of either of the parties added to his\nown forces will render him superior to any conspiracy. It would be\nsuperfluous to go through all particulars; for the rule of conduct which\nthe tyrant ought to pursue is evident enough, and that is, to affect to\nappear not the tyrant, but the king; the guardian of those he governs,\nnot their plunderer, [1315b] but their protector, and to affect\nthe middle rank in life, not one superior to all others: he should,\ntherefore, associate his nobles with him and soothe his people; for his\ngovernment will not only be necessarily more honourable and worthy of\nimitation, as it will be over men of worth, and not abject wretches who\nperpetually both hate and fear him; but it will be also more durable.\nLet him also frame his life so that his manners may be consentaneous\nto virtue, or at least let half of them be so, that he may not be\naltogether wicked, but only so in part.\nCHAPTER XII\nIndeed an oligarchy and a tyranny are of all governments of the shortest\nduration. The tyranny of Orthagoras and his family at Sicyon, it is\ntrue, continued longer than any other: the reason for which was, that\nthey used their power with moderation, and were in many particulars\nobedient to the laws; and, as Clisthenes was an able general, he never\nfell into contempt, and by the care he took that in many particulars his\ngovernment should be popular. He is reported also to have presented a\nperson with a crown who adjudged the victory to another; and some say\nthat it is the statue of that judge which is placed in the forum.\nThey say also, that Pisistratus submitted to be summoned into the court\nof the Areopagites. The second that we shall mention is the tyranny of\nthe Cypselidse, at Corinth, which continued seventy-seven years and\nsix months; for Cypselus was tyrant there thirty years, Periander\nforty-four, and Psammetichus, the son of Georgias, three years; the\nreason for which was, that Cypselus was a popular man, and governed\nwithout guards. Periander indeed ruled like a tyrant, but then he was an\nable general. The third was that of the Pisistradidae at Athens; but it\nwas not continual: for Pisistratus himself was twice expelled; so that\nout of thirty-three years he was only fifteen in power, and his son\neighteen; so that the whole time was thirty-three years. Of the rest\nwe shall mention that of Hiero, and Gelo at Syracuse; and this did not\ncontinue long, for both their reigns were only eighteen years; for\nGelo died in the eighth year of his tyranny, and Hiero in his tenth.\nThrasybulus fell in his eleventh month, and many other tyrannies have\ncontinued a very short time. We have now gone through the general cases\nof corruption and [1316a] means of preservation both in free states and\nmonarchies. In Plato's Republic, Socrates is introduced treating upon\nthe changes which different governments are liable to: but his discourse\nis faulty; for he does not particularly mention what changes the best\nand first governments are liable to; for he only assigns the general\ncause, of nothing being immutable, but that in time everything will\nalter [***tr.: text is unintelligible here***] he conceives that nature\nwill then produce bad men, who will not submit to education, and in\nthis, probably, he is not wrong; for it is certain that there are some\npersons whom it is impossible by any education to make good men; but\nwhy should this change be more peculiar to what he calls the best-formed\ngovernment, than to all other forms, and indeed to all other things\nthat exist? and in respect to his assigned time, as the cause of the\nalteration of all things, we find that those which did not begin\nto exist at the same time cease to be at the same time; so that, if\nanything came into beginning the day before the solstice, it must alter\nat the same time. Besides, why should such a form of government be\nchanged into the Lacedaemonian? for, in general, when governments alter,\nthey alter into the contrary species to what they before were, and\nnot into one like their former. And this reasoning holds true of other\nchanges; for he says, that from the Lacedaemonian form it changes into\nan oligarchy, and from thence into a democracy, and from a democracy\ninto a tyranny: and sometimes a contrary change takes place, as from a\ndemocracy into an oligarchy, rather than into a monarchy. With respect\nto a tyranny he neither says whether there will be any change in it; or\nif not, to what cause it will be owing; or if there is, into what other\nstate it will alter: but the reason of this is, that a tyranny is an\nindeterminate government; and, according to him, every state ought to\nalter into the first, and most perfect, thus the continuity and circle\nwould be preserved. But one tyranny often changed into another; as\nat Syria, from Myron's to Clisthenes'; or into an oligarchy, as was\nAntileo's at Chalcas; or into a democracy, as was Gelo's at Syracuse; or\ninto an aristocracy, as was Charilaus's at Lacedaemon, and at Carthage.\nAn oligarchy is also changed into a tyranny; such was the rise of most\nof the ancient tyrannies in Sicily; at Leontini, into the tyranny of\nPanaetius; at Gela, into that of Cleander; at Rhegium into that of\nAnaxilaus; and the like in many other cities. It is absurd also to\nsuppose, that a state is changed into an oligarchy because those who are\nin power are avaricious and greedy of money, and not because those who\nare by far richer than their fellow citizens think it unfair that those\nwho have nothing should have an equal share in the rule of the state\nwith themselves, who possess so much-for in many oligarchies it is not\nallowable to be employed in money-getting, and there are many laws to\nprevent it. But in Carthage, which is a democracy, money-getting is\ncreditable, and yet their form of government remains unaltered. It is\nalso absurd to say, that in an oligarchy there are two cities, one of\nthe poor and another of the rich; for why should this happen to them\nmore than to the Lacedaemonians, or any other state where all possess\nnot equal property, or where all are not equally good? for though no\none member of the community should be poorer than he was before, yet\na democracy might nevertheless change into an oligarchy; if the rich\nshould be more powerful than the poor, and the one too negligent, and\nthe other attentive: and though these changes are owing to many causes,\nyet he mentions but one only, that the citizens become poor by luxury,\nand paying interest-money; as if at first they were all rich, or the\ngreater part of them: but this is not so, but when some of those who\nhave the principal management of public affairs lose their fortunes,\nthey will endeavour to bring about a revolution; but when others do,\nnothing of consequence will follow, nor when such states do alter is\nthere any more reason for their altering into a democracy than any\nother. Besides, though some of the members of the community may not have\nspent their fortunes, yet if they share not in the honours of the state,\nor if they are ill-used and insulted, they will endeavour to raise\nseditions, and bring about a revolution, that they may be allowed to do\nas they like; which, Plato says, arises from too much liberty. Although\nthere are many oligarchies and democracies, yet Socrates, when he is\ntreating of the changes they may undergo, speaks of them as if there was\nbut one of each sort.\nBOOK VI\nCHAPTER I\nWe have already shown what is the nature of the supreme council in the\nstate, and wherein one may differ from another, and how the different\nmagistrates should be regulated; and also the judicial department, and\nwhat is best suited to what state; and also to what causes both the\ndestruction and preservation of governments are owing.\nAs there are very many species of democracies, as well as of other\nstates, it will not be amiss to consider at the same time anything which\nwe may have omitted to mention concerning either of them, and to allot\nto each that mode of conduct which is peculiar to and advantageous for\nthem; and also to inquire into the combinations of all these different\nmodes of government which we [1317a] have mentioned; for as these are\nblended together the government is altered, as from an aristocracy to\nbe an oligarchy, and from a free state to be a democracy. Now, I mean\nby those combinations of government (which I ought to examine into, but\nhave not yet done), namely, whether the deliberative department and the\nelection of magistrates is regulated in a manner correspondent to an\noligarchy, or the judicial to an aristocracy, or the deliberative part\nonly to an oligarchy, and the election of magistrates to an aristocracy,\nor whether, in any other manner, everything is not regulated according\nto the nature of the government. But we will first consider what\nparticular sort of democracy is fitted to a particular city, and also\nwhat particular oligarchy to a particular people; and of other states,\nwhat is advantageous to what. It is also necessary to show clearly, not\nonly which of these governments is best for a state, but also how\nit ought to be established there, and other things we will treat of\nbriefly.\nAnd first, we will speak of a democracy; and this will at the same\ntime show clearly the nature of its opposite which some persons call\nan oligarchy; and in doing this we must examine into all the parts of\na democracy, and everything that is connected therewith; for from the\nmanner in which these are compounded together different species of\ndemocracies arise: and hence it is that they are more than one, and of\nvarious natures. Now, there are two causes which occasion there being so\nmany democracies; one of which is that which we have already mentioned;\nnamely, there being different sorts of people; for in one country the\nmajority are husbandmen, in another mechanics, and hired servants; if\nthe first of these is added to the second, and the third to both of\nthem, the democracy will not only differ in the particular of better or\nworse, but in this, that it will be no longer the same government; the\nother is that which we will now speak of. The different things which are\nconnected with democracies and seem to make part of these states, do,\nfrom their being joined to them, render them different from others: this\nattending a few, that more, and another all. It is necessary that he who\nwould found any state which he may happen to approve of, or correct one,\nshould be acquainted with all these particulars. All founders of states\nendeavour to comprehend within their own plan everything of nearly the\nsame kind with it; but in doing this they err, in the manner I have\nalready described in treating of the preservation and destruction of\ngovernments. I will now speak of these first principles and manners, and\nwhatever else a democratical state requires.\nCHAPTER II\nNow the foundation of a democratical state is liberty, and people have\nbeen accustomed to say this as if here only liberty was to be found; for\nthey affirm that this is the end proposed by every democracy. But one\npart of liberty is to govern and be governed alternately; for, according\nto democratical justice, equality is measured by numbers, and not by\nworth: and this being just, it is necessary that the supreme power\nshould be vested in the people at large; and that what the majority\ndetermine should be final: so that in a democracy the poor ought to have\nmore power than the rich, as being the greater number; for this is one\nmark of liberty which all framers of a democracy lay down as a criterion\nof that state; another is, to live as every one likes; for this, they\nsay, is a right which liberty gives, since he is a slave who must live\nas he likes not. This, then, is another criterion of a democracy. Hence\narises the claim to be under no command whatsoever to any one, upon any\naccount, any otherwise than by rotation, and that just as far only as\nthat person is, in his turn, under his also. This also is conducive to\nthat equality which liberty demands. These things being premised, and\nsuch being the government, it follows that such rules as the following\nshould be observed in it, that all the magistrates should be chosen out\nof all the people, and all to command each, and each in his turn all:\nthat all the magistrates should be chosen by lot, except to those\noffices only which required some particular knowledge and skill: that no\ncensus, or a very small one, should be required to qualify a man for any\noffice: that none should be in the same employment twice, or very few,\nand very seldom, except in the army: that all their appointments should\nbe limited to a very short time, or at least as many as possible:\nthat the whole community should be qualified to judge in all causes\nwhatsoever, let the object be ever so extensive, ever so interesting, or\nof ever so high a nature; as at Athens, where the people at large judge\nthe magistrates when they come out of office, and decide concerning\npublic affairs as well as private contracts: that the supreme power\nshould be in the public assembly; and that no magistrate should be\nallowed any discretionary power but in a few instances, and of no\nconsequence to public business. Of all magistrates a senate is best\nsuited to a democracy, where the whole community is not paid for giving\ntheir attendance; for in that case it loses its power; for then the\npeople will bring all causes before them, by appeal, as we have\nalready mentioned in a former book. In the next place, there should, if\npossible, be a fund to pay all the citizens--who have any share in the\nmanagement of public affairs, either as members of the assembly, judges,\nand magistrates; but if this cannot be done, at least the magistrates,\nthe judges the senators, and members of the supreme assembly, and also\nthose officers who are obliged to eat at a common table ought to be\npaid. Moreover, as an oligarchy is said to be a government of men of\nfamily, fortune, and education; so, on the contrary, a democracy is a\ngovernment in the hands of men of no birth, indigent circumstances, and\nmechanical employments. In this state also no office [1318a] should be\nfor life; and, if any such should remain after the government has been\nlong changed into a democracy, they should endeavour by degrees to\ndiminish the power; and also elect by lot instead of vote. These things,\nthen, appertain to all democracies; namely, to be established on that\nprinciple of justice which is homogeneous to those governments; that is,\nthat all the members of the state, by number, should enjoy an equality,\nwhich seems chiefly to constitute a democracy, or government of the\npeople: for it seems perfectly equal that the rich should have no more\nshare in the government than the poor, nor be alone in power; but that\nall should be equal, according to number; for thus, they think, the\nequality and liberty of the state best preserved.\nCHAPTER III\nIn the next place we must inquire how this equality is to be procured.\nShall the qualifications be divided so that five hundred rich should be\nequal to a thousand poor, or shall the thousand have equal power with\nthe five hundred? or shall we not establish our equality in this manner?\nbut divide indeed thus, and afterwards taking an equal number both out\nof the five hundred and the thousand, invest them with the power of\ncreating the magistrates and judges. Is this state then established\naccording to perfect democratical justice, or rather that which is\nguided by numbers only? For the defenders of a democracy say, that that\nis just which the majority approve of: but the favourers of an oligarchy\nsay, that that is just which those who have most approve of; and that we\nought to be directed by the value of property. Both the propositions are\nunjust; for if we agree with what the few propose we erect a tyranny:\nfor if it should happen that an individual should have more than the\nrest who are rich, according to oligarchical justice, this man alone\nhas a right to the supreme power; but if superiority of numbers is to\nprevail, injustice will then be done by confiscating the property of the\nrich, who are few, as we have already said. What then that equality is,\nwhich both parties will admit, must be collected from the definition\nof right which is common to them both; for they both say that what the\nmajority of the state approves of ought to be established. Be it so; but\nnot entirely: but since a city happens to be made up of two different\nranks of people, the rich and the poor, let that be established which\nis approved of by both these, or the greater part: but should there be\nopposite sentiments, let that be established which shall be approved\nof by the greater part: but let this be according to the census; for\ninstance, if there should be ten of the rich and twenty of the poor, and\nsix of the first and fifteen of the last should agree upon any measure,\nand the remaining four of the rich should join with the remaining five\nof the poor in opposing it, that party whose census when added together\nshould determine which opinion should be law, and should these happen\nto be equal, it should be regarded as a case similar to an assembly or\ncourt of justice dividing equally upon any question that comes before\nthem, who either determine it by lot or some such method. But although,\nwith [1318b] respect to what is equal and just, it may be very difficult\nto establish the truth, yet it is much easier to do than to persuade\nthose who have it in their power to encroach upon others to be guided\nthereby; for the weak always desire what is equal and just, but the\npowerful pay no regard thereunto.\nCHAPTER IV\nThere are four kinds of democracies. The best is that which is composed\nof those first in order, as we have already said, and this also is the\nmost ancient of any. I call that the first which every one would place\nso, was he to divide the people; for the best part of these are the\nhusbandmen. We see, then, that a democracy may be framed where the\nmajority live by tillage or pasturage; for, as their property is\nbut small, they will not be at leisure perpetually to hold public\nassemblies, but will be continually employed in following their own\nbusiness, not having otherwise the means of living; nor will they be\ndesirous of what another enjoys, but will rather like to follow their\nown business than meddle with state affairs and accept the offices of\ngovernment, which will be attended with no great profit; for the major\npart of mankind are rather desirous of riches than honour (a proof of\nthis is, that they submitted to the tyrannies in ancient times, and do\nnow submit to the oligarchies, if no one hinders them in their usual\noccupations, or deprives them of their property; for some of them soon\nget rich, others are removed from poverty); besides, their having the\nright of election and calling their magistrates to account for their\nconduct when they come out of office, will satisfy their desire of\nhonours, if any of them entertain that passion: for in some states,\nthough the commonalty have not the right of electing the magistrates,\nyet it is vested in part of that body chosen to represent them: and it\nis sufficient for the people at large to possess the deliberative power:\nand this ought to be considered as a species of democracy; such was that\nformerly at Mantinsea: for which reason it is proper for the democracy\nwe have been now treating of to have a power (and it has been usual for\nthem to have it) of censuring their magistrates when out of office,\nand sitting in judgment upon all causes: but that the chief magistrates\nshould be elected, and according to a certain census, which should vary\nwith the rank of their office, or else not by a census, but according\nto their abilities for their respective appointments. A state thus\nconstituted must be well constituted; for the magistracies will be\nalways filled with the best men with the approbation of the people;\nwho will not envy their superiors: and these and the nobles should\nbe content with this part in the administration; for they will not be\ngoverned by their inferiors. They will be also careful to use their\npower with moderation, as there are others to whom full power is\ndelegated to censure their conduct; for it is very serviceable to the\nstate to have them dependent upon others, and not to be permitted to do\nwhatsoever they choose; for with such a liberty there would be no check\nto that evil particle there is in every one: therefore it is [1319a]\nnecessary and most for the benefit of the state that the offices thereof\nshould be filled by the principal persons in it, whose characters are\nunblemished, and that the people are not oppressed. It is now evident\nthat this is the best species of democracy, and on what account; because\nthe people are such and have such powers as they ought to have. To\nestablish a democracy of husbandmen some of those laws which were\nobserved in many ancient states are universally useful; as, for\ninstance, on no account to permit any one to possess more than a certain\nquantity of land, or within a certain distance from the city. Formerly\nalso, in some states, no one was allowed to sell their original lot of\nland. They also mention a law of one Oxylus, which forbade any one to\nadd to their patrimony by usury. We ought also to follow the law of\nthe Aphutaeans, as useful to direct us in this particular we are now\nspeaking of; for they having but very little ground, while they were\na numerous people, and at the same time were all husbandmen, did not\ninclude all their lands within the census, but divided them in such a\nmanner that, according to the census, the poor had more power than\nthe rich. Next to the commonalty of husbandmen is one of shepherds and\nherdsmen; for they have many things in common with them, and, by their\nway of life, are excellently qualified to make good soldiers, stout in\nbody, and able to continue in the open air all night. The generality of\nthe people of whom other democracies are composed are much worse than\nthese; for their lives are wretched nor have they any business with\nvirtue in anything they do; these are your mechanics, your exchange-men,\nand hired servants; as all these sorts of men frequent the exchange and\nthe citadel, they can readily attend the public assembly; whereas the\nhusbandmen, being more dispersed in the country, cannot so easily meet\ntogether; nor are they equally desirous of doing it with these others!\nWhen a country happens to be so situated that a great part of the land\nlies at a distance from the city, there it is easy to establish a good\ndemocracy or a free state for the people in general will be obliged to\nlive in the country; so that it will be necessary in such a democracy,\nthough there may be an exchange-mob at hand, never to allow a legal\nassembly without the inhabitants of the country attend. We have shown in\nwhat manner the first and best democracy ought to be established, and it\nwill be equally evident as to the rest, for from these we [1319b] should\nproceed as a guide, and always separate the meanest of the people from\nthe rest. But the last and worst, which gives to every citizen without\ndistinction a share in every part of the administration, is what few\ncitizens can bear, nor is it easy to preserve for any long time, unless\nwell supported by laws and manners. We have already noticed almost every\ncause that can destroy either this or any other state. Those who have\ntaken the lead in such a democracy have endeavoured to support it, and\nmake the people powerful by collecting together as many persons as they\ncould and giving them their freedom, not only legitimately but naturally\nborn, and also if either of their parents were citizens, that is to say,\nif either their father or mother; and this method is better suited to\nthis state than any other: and thus the demagogues have usually managed.\nThey ought, however, to take care, and do this no longer than the common\npeople are superior to the nobles and those of the middle rank, and\nthen stop; for, if they proceed still further, they will make the\nstate disorderly, and the nobles will ill brook the power of the common\npeople, and be full of resentment against it; which was the cause of\nan insurrection at Cyrene: for a little evil is overlooked, but when it\nbecomes a great one it strikes the eye. It is, moreover, very-useful in\nsuch a state to do as Clisthenes did at Athens, when he was desirous of\nincreasing the power of the people, and as those did who established the\ndemocracy in Cyrene; that is, to institute many tribes and fraternities,\nand to make the religious rites of private persons few, and those\ncommon; and every means is to be contrived to associate and blend the\npeople together as much as possible; and that all former customs be\nbroken through. Moreover, whatsoever is practised in a tyranny\nseems adapted to a democracy of this species; as, for instance, the\nlicentiousness of the slaves, the women, and the children; for this to\na certain degree is useful in such a state; and also to overlook every\none's living as they choose; for many will support such a government:\nfor it is more agreeable to many to live without any control than as\nprudence would direct.\nCHAPTER V\nIt is also the business of the legislator and all those who would\nsupport a government of this sort not to make it too great a work, or\ntoo perfect; but to aim only to render it stable: for, let a state be\nconstituted ever so badly, there is no difficulty in its continuing a\nfew days: they should therefore endeavour to procure its safety by\nall those ways which we have described in assigning the causes of the\npreservation and destruction of governments; avoiding what is hurtful,\nand by framing such laws, written and unwritten, as contain those things\nwhich chiefly tend to the preservation of the state; nor to suppose that\nthat is useful either for a democratic or [1320a] an oligarchic form of\ngovernment which contributes to make them more purely so, but what will\ncontribute to their duration: but our demagogues at present, to flatter\nthe people, occasion frequent confiscations in the courts; for which\nreason those who have the welfare of the state really at heart should\nact directly opposite to what they do, and enact a law to prevent\nforfeitures from being divided amongst the people or paid into the\ntreasury, but to have them set apart for sacred uses: for those who\nare of a bad disposition would not then be the less cautious, as their\npunishment would be the same; and the community would not be so ready to\ncondemn those whom they sat in judgment on when they were to get nothing\nby it: they should also take care that the causes which are brought\nbefore the public should be as few as possible, and punish with the\nutmost severity those who rashly brought an action against any one; for\nit is not the commons but the nobles who are generally prosecuted: for\nin all things the citizens of the same state ought to be affectionate to\neach other, at least not to treat those who have the chief power in\nit as their enemies. Now, as the democracies which have been lately\nestablished are very numerous, and it is difficult to get the common\npeople to attend the public assemblies without they are paid for it,\nthis, when there is not a sufficient public revenue, is fatal to the\nnobles; for the deficiencies therein must be necessarily made up by\ntaxes, confiscations, and fines imposed by corrupt courts of justice:\nwhich things have already destroyed many democracies. Whenever, then,\nthe revenues of the state are small, there should be but few public\nassemblies and but few courts of justice: these, however, should have\nvery extensive jurisdictions, but should continue sitting a few days\nonly, for by this means the rich would not fear the expense, although\nthey should receive nothing for their attendance, though the poor did;\nand judgment also would be given much better; for the rich will not\nchoose to be long absent from their own affairs, but will willingly\nbe so for a short time: and, when there are sufficient revenues, a\ndifferent conduct ought to be pursued from what the demagogues at\npresent follow; for now they divide the surplus of the public money\namongst the poor; these receive it and again want the same supply, while\nthe giving it is like pouring water into a sieve: but the true patriot\nin a democracy ought to take care that the majority of the community are\nnot too poor, for this is the cause of rapacity in that government; he\ntherefore should endeavour that they may enjoy perpetual plenty; and\nas this also is advantageous to the rich, what can be saved out of the\npublic money should be put by, and then divided at once amongst the\npoor, if possible, in such a quantity as may enable every one of them to\npurchase a little field, and, if that cannot be done, at least to give\neach of them enough to procure the implements [1320b] of trade and\nhusbandry; and if there is not enough for all to receive so much at\nonce, then to divide it according to tribes or any other allotment. In\nthe meantime let the rich pay them for necessary services, but not be\nobliged to find them in useless amusements. And something like this\nwas the manner in which they managed at Carthage, and preserved the\naffections of the people; for by continually sending some of their\ncommunity into colonies they procured plenty. It is also worthy of a\nsensible and generous nobility to divide the poor amongst them, and\nsupplying them with what is necessary, induce them to work; or to\nimitate the conduct of the people at Tarentum: for they, permitting the\npoor to partake in common of everything which is needful for them, gain\nthe affections of the commonalty. They have also two different ways of\nelecting their magistrates; for some are chosen by vote, others by\nlot; by the last, that the people at large may have some share in the\nadministration; by the former, that the state may be well governed: the\nsame may be accomplished if of the same magistrates you choose some by\nvote, others by lot. And thus much for the manner in which democracies\nought to be established.\nCHAPTER VI\nWhat has been already said will almost of itself sufficiently show how\nan oligarchy ought to be founded; for he who would frame such a state\nshould have in his view a democracy to oppose it; for every species of\noligarchy should be founded on principles diametrically opposite to some\nspecies of democracy.\nThe first and best-framed oligarchy is that which approaches near to\nwhat we call a free state; in which there ought to be two different\ncensus, the one high, the other low: from those who are within the\nlatter the ordinary officers of the state ought to be chosen; from the\nformer the supreme magistrates: nor should any one be excluded from a\npart of the administration who was within the census; which should be\nso regulated that the commonalty who are included in it should by means\nthereof be superior to those who have no share in the government; for\nthose who are to have the management of public affairs ought always to\nbe chosen out of the better sort of the people. Much in the same manner\nought that oligarchy to be established which is next in order: but as to\nthat which is most opposite to a pure democracy, and approaches nearest\nto a dynasty and a tyranny, as it is of all others the worst, so it\nrequires the greatest care and caution to preserve it: for as bodies of\nsound and healthy constitutions and ships which are well manned and\nwell found for sailing can bear many injuries without perishing, while\na diseased body or a leaky ship with an indifferent crew cannot support\nthe [1321a] least shock; so the worst-established governments want most\nlooking after. A number of citizens is the preservation of a democracy;\nfor these are opposed to those rights which are founded in rank: on\nthe contrary, the preservation of an oligarchy depends upon the due\nregulation of the different orders in the society.\nCHAPTER VII\nAs the greater part of the community are divided into four sorts of\npeople; husbandmen, mechanics, traders, and hired servants; and as those\nwho are employed in war may likewise be divided into four; the horsemen,\nthe heavy-armed soldier, the light-armed, and the sailor, where the\nnature of the country can admit a great number of horse; there a\npowerful oligarchy may be easily established: for the safety of the\ninhabitants depends upon a force of that sort; but those who can support\nthe expense of horsemen must be persons of some considerable fortune.\nWhere the troops are chiefly heavy-armed, there an oligarchy, inferior\nin power to the other, may be established; for the heavy-armed are\nrather made up of men of substance than the poor: but the light-armed\nand the sailors always contribute to support a democracy: but where the\nnumber of these is very great and a sedition arises, the other parts of\nthe community fight at a disadvantage; but a remedy for this evil is\nto be learned from skilful generals, who always mix a proper number of\nlight-armed soldiers with their horse and heavy-armed: for it is with\nthose that the populace get the better of the men of fortune in an\ninsurrection; for these being lighter are easily a match for the horse\nand the heavy-armed: so that for an oligarchy to form a body of troops\nfrom these is to form it against itself: but as a city is composed of\npersons of different ages, some young and some old, the fathers should\nteach their sons, while they were very young, a light and easy exercise;\nbut, when they are grown up, they should be perfect in every warlike\nexercise. Now, the admission of the people to any share in the\ngovernment should either be (as I said before) regulated by a census, or\nelse, as at Thebes, allowed to those who for a certain time have ceased\nfrom any mechanic employment, or as at Massalia, where they are chosen\naccording to their worth, whether citizens or foreigners. With respect\nto the magistrates of the highest rank which it may be necessary to\nhave in a state, the services they are bound to do the public should be\nexpressly laid down, to prevent the common people from being desirous\nof accepting their employments, and also to induce them to regard their\nmagistrates with favour when they know what a price they pay for their\nhonours. It is also necessary that the magistrates, upon entering into\ntheir offices, should make magnificent sacrifices and erect some public\nstructure, that the people partaking of the entertainment, and seeing\nthe city ornamented with votive gifts in their temples and public\nstructures, may see with pleasure the stability of the government: add\nto this also, that the nobles will have their generosity recorded: but\nnow this is not the conduct which those who are at present at the head\nof an oligarchy pursue, but the contrary; for they are not more desirous\nof honour than of gain; for which reason such oligarchies may more\nproperly be called little democracies. Thus [1321b] we have explained on\nwhat principles a democracy and an oligarchy ought to be established.\nCHAPTER VIII\nAfter what has been said I proceed next to treat particularly of the\nmagistrates; of what nature they should be, how many, and for what\npurpose, as I have already mentioned: for without necessary magistrates\nno state can exist, nor without those which contribute to its dignity\nand good order can exist happily: now it is necessary that in small\nstates the magistrates should be few; in a large one, many: also to\nknow well what offices may be joined together, and what ought to be\nseparated. The first thing necessary is to establish proper regulators\nin the markets; for which purpose a certain magistrate should be\nappointed to inspect their contracts and preserve good order; for of\nnecessity, in almost every city there must be both buyers and sellers to\nsupply each other's mutual wants: and this is what is most productive\nof the comforts of life; for the sake of which men seem to have joined\ntogether in one community. A second care, and nearly related to the\nfirst, is to have an eye both to the public and private edifices in\nthe city, that they may be an ornament; and also to take care of all\nbuildings which are likely to fall: and to see that the highways are\nkept in proper repair; and also that the landmarks between different\nestates are preserved, that there may be no disputes on that account;\nand all other business of the same nature. Now, this business may be\ndivided into several branches, over each of which in populous cities\nthey appoint a separate person; one to inspect the buildings, another\nthe fountains, another the harbours; and they are called the inspectors\nof the city. A third, which is very like the last, and conversant nearly\nabout the same objects, only in the country, is to take care of what\nis done out of the city. The officers who have this employment we call\ninspectors of the lands, or inspectors of the woods; but the business\nof all three of them is the same. There must also be other officers\nappointed to receive the public revenue and to deliver it out to those\nwho are in the different departments of the state: these are called\nreceivers or quaestors. There must also be another, before whom all\nprivate contracts and sentences of courts should be enrolled, as well\nas proceedings and declarations. Sometimes this employment is divided\namongst many, but there is one supreme over the rest; these are called\nproctors, notaries, and the like. Next to these is an officer whose\nbusiness is of all others the most necessary, and yet most difficult;\nnamely, to take care that sentence is executed upon those who are\ncondemned; and that every one pays the fines laid on him; and also to\nhave the charge of those who are in prison. [1322a] This office is very\ndisagreeable on account of the odium attending it, so that no one will\nengage therein without it is made very profitable, or, if they do,\nwill they be willing to execute it according to law; but it is most\nnecessary, as it is of no service to pass judgment in any cause without\nthat judgment is carried into execution: for without this human society\ncould not subsist: for which reason it is best that this office should\nnot be executed by one person, but by some of the magistrates of the\nother courts. In like manner, the taking care that those fines which\nare ordered by the judges are levied should be divided amongst different\npersons. And as different magistrates judge different causes, let the\ncauses of the young be heard by the young: and as to those which are\nalready brought to a hearing, let one person pass sentence, and another\nsee it executed: as, for instance, let the magistrates who have the care\nof the public buildings execute the sentence which the inspectors of\nthe markets have passed, and the like in other cases: for by so much the\nless odium attends those who carry the laws into execution, by so much\nthe easier will they be properly put in force: therefore for the same\npersons to pass the sentence and to execute it will subject them to\ngeneral hatred; and if they pass it upon all, they will be considered\nas the enemies of all. Thus one person has often the custody of the\nprisoner's body, while another sees the sentence against him executed,\nas the eleven did at Athens: for which reason it is prudent to separate\nthese offices, and to give great attention thereunto as equally\nnecessary with anything we have already mentioned; for it will certainly\nhappen that men of character will decline accepting this office, and\nworthless persons cannot properly be entrusted with it, as having\nthemselves rather an occasion for a guard than being qualified to guard\nothers. This, therefore, ought by no means to be a separate office from\nothers; nor should it be continually allotted to any individuals, but\nthe young men; where there is a city-guard, the youths ought in turns\nto take these offices upon them. These, then, as the most necessary\nmagistrates, ought to be first mentioned: next to these are others no\nless necessary, but of much higher rank, for they ought to be men of\ngreat skill and fidelity. These are they who have the guard of the city,\nand provide everything that is necessary for war; whose business it is,\nboth in war and peace, to defend the walls and the gates, and to take\ncare to muster and marshal the citizens. Over all these there are\nsometimes more officers, sometimes fewer: thus in little cities there is\nonly one whom they call either general or polemarch; but where there are\nhorse and light-armed troops, and bowmen, and sailors, they sometimes\nput distinct commanders over each of these; who again have others under\nthem, according to their different divisions; all of which join together\nto make one military body: and thus much for this department. Since some\nof the magistrates, if not all, have business with the public money,\nit is necessary that there should be other officers, whose employment\nshould be nothing else than to take an account of what they have, and\ncorrect any mismanagement therein. But besides all these magistrates\nthere is one who is supreme over them all, who very often has in his own\npower the disposal of the public revenue and taxes; who presides over\nthe people when the supreme power is in them; for there must be some\nmagistrate who has a power to summon them together, and to preside as\nhead of the state. These are sometimes called preadvisers; but where\nthere are many, more properly a council. These are nearly the civil\nmagistrates which are requisite to a government: but there are other\npersons whose business is confined to religion; as the priests, and\nthose who are to take care of the temples, that they are kept in proper\nrepair, or, if they fall down, that they may be rebuilt; and whatever\nelse belongs to public worship. This charge is sometimes entrusted to\none person, as in very small cities: in others it is delegated to many,\nand these distinct from the priesthood, as the builders or keepers of\nholy places, and officers of the sacred revenue. Next to these are\nthose who are appointed to have the general care of all those public\nsacrifices to the tutelar god of the state, which the laws do not\nentrust to the priests: and these in different states have different\nappellations. To enumerate in few words the different departments of\nall those magistrates who are necessary: these are either religion,\nwar, taxes, expenditures, markets, public buildings, harbours, highways.\nBelonging to the courts of justice there are scribes to enroll private\ncontracts; and there must also be guards set over the prisoners, others\nto see the law is executed, council on either side, and also others to\nwatch over the conduct of those who are to decide the causes. Amongst\nthe magistrates also may finally be reckoned those who are to give their\nadvice in public affairs. But separate states, who are peculiarly happy\nand have leisure to attend to more minute particulars, and are very\nattentive to good order, require particular magistrates for themselves;\nsuch as those who have the government of the women; who are to see the\nlaws are executed; who take care of the boys and preside over their\neducation. To these may be added those who have the care of their\ngymnastic exercises, [1323a] their theatres, and every other public\nspectacle which there may happen to be. Some of these, however, are not\nof general use; as the governors of the women: for the poor are obliged\nto employ their wives and children in servile offices for want of\nslaves. As there are three magistrates to whom some states entrust the\nsupreme power; namely, guardians of the laws, preadvisers, and senators;\nguardians of the laws suit best to an aristocracy, preadvisers to an\noligarchy, and a senate to a democracy. And thus much briefly concerning\nall magistrates.\nBOOK VII\nCHAPTER I\nHe who proposes to make that inquiry which is necessary concerning what\ngovernment is best, ought first to determine what manner of living is\nmost eligible; for while this remains uncertain it will also be equally\nuncertain what government is best: for, provided no unexpected accidents\ninterfere, it is highly probable, that those who enjoy the best\ngovernment will live the most happily according to their circumstances;\nhe ought, therefore, first to know what manner of life is most desirable\nfor all; and afterwards whether this life is the same to the man and\nthe citizen, or different. As I imagine that I have already sufficiently\nshown what sort of life is best in my popular discourses on that\nsubject, I think I may very properly repeat the same here; as most\ncertainly no one ever called in question the propriety of one of the\ndivisions; namely, that as what is good, relative to man, may be divided\ninto three sorts, what is external, what appertains to the body, and\nwhat to the soul, it is evident that all these must conspire to make\na man happy: for no one would say that a man was happy who had no\nfortitude, no temperance, no justice, no prudence; but was afraid of the\nflies that flew round him: nor would abstain from the meanest theft if\nhe was either hungry or dry, or would murder his dearest friend for\na farthing; and also was in every particular as wanting in his\nunderstanding as an infant or an idiot. These truths are so evident that\nall must agree to them; though some may dispute about the quantity and\nthe degree: for they may think, that a very little virtue is sufficient\nfor happiness; but for riches, property, power, honour, and all such\nthings, they endeavour to increase them without bounds: but to such we\nreply, that it is easy to prove from what experience teaches us in these\ncases, that these external goods produce not virtue, but virtue them.\nAs to a happy life, whether it is to be found in pleasure or virtue or\nboth, certain it is, that those whose morals are most pure, and whose\nunderstandings are best cultivated, will enjoy more of it, although\ntheir fortune is but moderate than those do who own an exuberance of\nwealth, are deficient in those; and this utility any one who reflects\nmay easily convince himself of; for whatsoever is external has its\nboundary, as a machine, and whatsoever is useful in its excess is either\nnecessarily hurtful, or at best useless to the possessor; but every good\nquality of the soul the higher it is in degree, so much the more useful\nit is, if it is permitted on this subject to use the word useful as well\nas noble. It is also very evident, that the accidents of each subject\ntake place of each other, as the subjects themselves, of which we allow\nthey are accidents, differ from each other in value; so that if the soul\nis more noble than any outward possession, as the body, both in itself\nand with respect to us, it must be admitted of course that the best\naccidents of each must follow the same analogy. Besides, it is for the\nsake of the soul that these things are desirable; and it is on this\naccount that wise men should desire them, not the soul for them. Let us\ntherefore be well assured, that every one enjoys as much happiness as he\npossesses virtue and wisdom, and acts according to their dictates; since\nfor this we have the example of GOD Himself, _who is completely happy,\nnot from any external good, but in Himself, and because such is His\nnature_. For good fortune is something different from happiness, as every\ngood which depends not on the mind is owing to chance or fortune; but\nit is not from fortune that any one is wise and just: hence it follows,\nthat that city is happiest which is the best and acts best: for no one\ncan do well who acts not well; nor can the deeds either of man or city\nbe praiseworthy without virtue and wisdom; for whatsoever is just, or\nwise, or prudent in a man, the same things are just, wise, and prudent\nin a city.\nThus much by way of introduction; for I could not but just touch upon\nthis subject, though I could not go through a complete investigation\nof it, as it properly belongs to another question: let us at present\nsuppose so much, that a man's happiest life, both as an individual and\nas a citizen, is a life of virtue, accompanied with those enjoyments\nwhich virtue usually procures. If [1324a] there are any who are not\nconvinced by what I have said, their doubts shall be answered hereafter,\nat present we shall proceed according to our intended method.\nCHAPTER II\nIt now remains for us to say whether the happiness of any individual\nman and the city is the same or different: but this also is evident; for\nwhosoever supposes that riches will make a person happy, must place the\nhappiness of the city in riches if it possesses them; those who prefer a\nlife which enjoys a tyrannic power over others will also think, that the\ncity which has many others under its command is most happy: thus also\nif any one approves a man for his virtue, he will think the most worthy\ncity the happiest: but here there are two particulars which require\nconsideration, one of which is, whether it is the most eligible life\nto be a member of the community and enjoy the rights of a citizen, or\nwhether to live as a stranger, without interfering in public affairs;\nand also what form of government is to be preferred, and what\ndisposition of the state is best; whether the whole community should be\neligible to a share in the administration, or only the greater part, and\nsome only: as this, therefore, is a subject of political examination\nand speculation, and not what concerns the individual, and the first of\nthese is what we are at present engaged in, the one of these I am not\nobliged to speak to, the other is the proper business of my present\ndesign. It is evident that government must be the best which is so\nestablished, that every one therein may have it in his power to act\nvirtuously and live happily: but some, who admit that a life of virtue\nis most eligible, still doubt which is preferable a public life of\nactive virtue, or one entirely disengaged from what is without and\nspent in contemplation; which some say is the only one worthy of a\nphilosopher; and one of these two different modes of life both now\nand formerly seem to have been chosen by all those who were the most\nvirtuous men; I mean the public or philosophic. And yet it is of no\nlittle consequence on which side the truth lies; for a man of sense\nmust naturally incline to the better choice; both as an individual and a\ncitizen. Some think that a tyrannic government over those near us is\nthe greatest injustice; but that a political one is not unjust: but that\nstill is a restraint on the pleasures and tranquillity of life. Others\nhold the quite contrary opinion, and think that a public and active life\nis the only life for man: for that private persons have no opportunity\nof practising any one virtue, more than they have who are engaged\nin public life the management of the [1324b] state. These are their\nsentiments; others say, that a tyrannical and despotical mode of\ngovernment is the only happy one; for even amongst some free states the\nobject of their laws seems to be to tyrannise over their neighbours: so\nthat the generality of political institutions, wheresoever dispersed,\nif they have any one common object in view, have all of them this,\nto conquer and govern. It is evident, both from the laws of the\nLacedaemonians and Cretans, as well as by the manner in which they\neducated their children, that all which they had in view was to make\nthem soldiers: besides, among all nations, those who have power enough\nand reduce others to servitude are honoured on that account; as were the\nScythians, Persians, Thracians, and Gauls: with some there are laws to\nheighten the virtue of courage; thus they tell us that at Carthage they\nallowed every person to wear as many rings for distinction as he had\nserved campaigns. There was also a law in Macedonia, that a man who had\nnot himself killed an enemy should be obliged to wear a halter; among\nthe Scythians, at a festival, none were permitted to drink out of\nthe cup was carried about who had not done the same thing. Among the\nIberians, a warlike nation, they fixed as many columns upon a man's tomb\nas he had slain enemies: and among different nations different things\nof this sort prevail, some of them established by law, others by custom.\nProbably it may seem too absurd to those who are willing to take this\nsubject into their consideration to inquire whether it is the business\nof a legislator to be able to point out by what means a state may govern\nand tyrannise over its neighbours, whether they will, or will not: for\nhow can that belong either to the politician or legislator which is\nunlawful? for that cannot be lawful which is done not only justly, but\nunjustly also: for a conquest may be unjustly made. But we see nothing\nof this in the arts: for it is the business neither of the physician nor\nthe pilot to use either persuasion or force, the one to his patients,\nthe other to his passengers: and yet many seem to think a despotic\ngovernment is a political one, and what they would not allow to be just\nor proper, if exercised over themselves, they will not blush to exercise\nover others; for they endeavour to be wisely governed themselves, but\nthink it of no consequence whether others are so or not: but a despotic\npower is absurd, except only where nature has framed the one party for\ndominion, the other for subordination; and therefore no one ought to\nassume it over all in general, but those only which are the proper\nobjects thereof: thus no one should hunt men either for food or\nsacrifice, but what is fit for those purposes, and these are wild\nanimals which are eatable.\nNow a city which is well governed might be very [1325a] happy in itself\nwhile it enjoyed a good system of laws, although it should happen to be\nso situated as to have no connection with any other state, though its\nconstitution should not be framed for war or conquest; for it would then\nhave no occasion for these. It is evident therefore that the business of\nwar is to be considered as commendable, not as a final end, but as the\nmeans of procuring it. It is the duty of a good legislator to examine\ncarefully into his state; and the nature of the people, and how they may\npartake of every intercourse, of a good life, and of the happiness which\nresults from it: and in this respect some laws and customs differ from\nothers. It is also the duty of a legislator, if he has any neighbouring\nstates to consider in what manner he shall oppose each of them, or what\ngood offices he shall show them. But what should be the final end of the\nbest governments will be considered hereafter.\nCHAPTER III\nWe will now speak to those who, while they agree that a life of virtue\nis most eligible, yet differ in the use of it addressing ourselves to\nboth these parties; for there are some who disapprove of all political\ngovernments, and think that the life of one who is really free is\ndifferent from the life of a citizen, and of all others most eligible:\nothers again think that the citizen is the best; and that it is\nimpossible for him who does nothing to be well employed; but that\nvirtuous activity and happiness are the same thing. Now both parties in\nsome particulars say what is right, in others what is wrong, thus, that\nthe life of a freeman is better than the life of a slave is true, for\na slave, as a slave, is employed in nothing honourable; for the common\nservile employments which he is commanded to perform have nothing\nvirtuous in them; but, on the other hand, it is not true that a\nsubmission to all sorts of governments is slavery; for the government of\nfreemen differs not more from the government of slaves than slavery and\nfreedom differ from each other in their nature; and how they do has been\nalready mentioned. To prefer doing of nothing to virtuous activity is\nalso wrong, for happiness consists in action, and many noble ends are\nproduced by the actions of the just and wise. From what we have already\ndetermined on this subject, some one probably may think, that supreme\npower is of all things best, as that will enable a man to command very\nmany useful services from others; so that he who can obtain this ought\nnot to give it up to another, but rather to seize it: and, for this\npurpose, the father should have no attention or regard for the son, or\nthe son for the father, or friend for friend; for what is best is most\neligible: but to be a member of the community and be in felicity is\nbest. What these persons advance might probably be true, if the supreme\ngood was certainly theirs who plunder and use violence to others: but\nit is [1325b] most unlikely that it should be so; for it is a mere\nsupposition: for it does not follow that their actions are honourable\nwho thus assume the supreme power over others, without they were by\nnature as superior to them as a man to a woman, a father to a child, a\nmaster to a slave: so that he who so far forsakes the paths of virtue\ncan never return back from whence he departed from them: for amongst\nequals whatever is fair and just ought to be reciprocal; for this is\nequal and right; but that equals should not partake of what is equal, or\nlike to like, is contrary to nature: but whatever is contrary to nature\nis not right; therefore, if there is any one superior to the rest of the\ncommunity in virtue and abilities for active life, him it is proper to\nfollow, him it is right to obey, but the one alone will not do, but must\nbe joined to the other also: and, if we are right in what we have now\nsaid, it follows that happiness consists in virtuous activity, and that\nboth with respect to the community as well as the individual an active\nlife is the happiest: not that an active life must necessarily refer to\nother persons, as some think, or that those studies alone are practical\nwhich are pursued to teach others what to do; for those are much more\nso whose final object is in themselves, and to improve the judgment and\nunderstanding of the man; for virtuous activity has an end, therefore\nis something practical; nay, those who contrive the plan which others\nfollow are more particularly said to act, and are superior to the\nworkmen who execute their designs. But it is not necessary that states\nwhich choose to have no intercourse with others should remain inactive;\nfor the several members thereof may have mutual intercourse with each\nother; for there are many opportunities for this among the different\ncitizens; the same thing is true of every individual: for, was it\notherwise, neither could the Deity nor the universe be perfect; to\nneither of whom can anything external separately exist. Hence it is\nevident that that very same life which is happy for each individual is\nhappy also for the state and every member of it.\nCHAPTER IV\nAs I have now finished what was introductory to this subject, and\nconsidered at large the nature of other states, it now remains that I\nshould first say what ought to be the establishment of a city which one\nshould form according to one's wish; for no good state can exist without\na moderate proportion of what is necessary. Many things therefore\nought to be forethought of as desirable, but none of them such as are\nimpossible: I mean relative to the number of citizens and the extent\nof the territory: for as other artificers, such as the weaver and the\nshipwright, ought to have such materials as are fit for their work,\nsince so much the better they are, by so much [1326a] superior will the\nwork itself necessarily be; so also ought the legislator and politician\nendeavour to procure proper materials for the business they have in\nhand. Now the first and principal instrument of the politician is the\nnumber of the people; he should therefore know how many, and what they\nnaturally ought to be: in like manner the country, how large, and what\nit is. Most persons think that it is necessary for a city to be large to\nbe happy: but, should this be true, they cannot tell what is a large one\nand what a small one; for according to the multitude of the inhabitants\nthey estimate the greatness of it; but they ought rather to consider its\nstrength than its numbers; for a state has a certain object in view, and\nfrom the power which it has in itself of accomplishing it, its greatness\nought to be estimated; as a person might say, that Hippocrates was a\ngreater physician, though not a greater man, than one that exceeded him\nin the size of his body: but if it was proper to determine the strength\nof the city from the number of the inhabitants, it should never be\ncollected from the multitude in general who may happen to be in it;\nfor in a city there must necessarily be many slaves, sojourners, and\nforeigners; but from those who are really part of the city and properly\nconstitute its members; a multitude of these is indeed a proof of a\nlarge city, but in a state where a large number of mechanics inhabit,\nand but few soldiers, such a state cannot be great; for the greatness of\nthe city, and the number of men in it, are not the same thing. This too\nis evident from fact, that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to\ngovern properly a very numerous body of men; for of all the states which\nappear well governed we find not one where the rights of a citizen are\nopen to an indiscriminate multitude. And this is also evident from the\nnature of the thing; for as law is a certain order, so good law is of\ncourse a certain good order: but too large a multitude are incapable of\nthis, unless under the government of that DIVINE POWER which comprehends\nthe universe. Not but that, as quantity and variety are usually\nessential to beauty, the perfection of a city consists in the largeness\nof it as far as that largeness is consistent with that order already\nmentioned: but still there is a determinate size to all cities, as well\nas everything else, whether animals, plants, or machines, for each of\nthese, if they are neither too little nor too big, have their\nproper powers; but when they have not their due growth, or are badly\nconstructed, as a ship a span long is not properly a ship, nor one of\ntwo furlongs length, but when it is of a fit size; for either from its\nsmallness or from its largeness it may be quite useless: so is it with\na city; one that is too small has not [1326b] in itself the power of\nself-defence, but this is essential to a city: one that is too large is\ncapable of self-defence in what is necessary; but then it is a nation\nand not a city: for it will be very difficult to accommodate a form\nof government to it: for who would choose to be the general of such\nan unwieldy multitude, or who could be their herald but a stentor? The\nfirst thing therefore necessary is, that a city should consist of such\nnumbers as will be sufficient to enable the inhabitants to live\nhappily in their political community: and it follows, that the more the\ninhabitants exceed that necessary number the greater will the city be:\nbut this must not be, as we have already said, without bounds; but what\nis its proper limit experience will easily show, and this experience is\nto be collected from the actions both of the governors and the governed.\nNow, as it belongs to the first to direct the inferior magistrates and\nto act as judges, it follows that they can neither determine causes\nwith justice nor issue their orders with propriety without they know the\ncharacters of their fellow-citizens: so that whenever this happens not\nto be done in these two particulars, the state must of necessity be\nbadly managed; for in both of them it is not right to determine too\nhastily and without proper knowledge, which must evidently be the case\nwhere the number of the citizens is too many: besides, it is more easy\nfor strangers and sojourners to assume the rights of citizens, as they\nwill easily escape detection in so great a multitude. It is evident,\nthen, that the best boundary for a city is that wherein the numbers are\nthe greatest possible, that they may be the better able to be sufficient\nin themselves, while at the same time they are not too large to be under\nthe eye and government of the magistrates. And thus let us determine the\nextent of a city.\nCHAPTER V\nWhat we have said concerning a city may nearly be applied to a country;\nfor as to what soil it should be, every one evidently will commend it\nif it is such as is sufficient in itself to furnish what will make the\ninhabitants happy; for which purpose it must be able to supply them\nwith all the necessaries of life; for it is the having these in plenty,\nwithout any want, which makes them content. As to its extent, it should\nbe such as may enable the inhabitants to live at their ease with freedom\nand temperance. Whether we have done right or wrong in fixing this limit\nto the territory shall be considered more minutely hereafter, when\nwe come particularly to inquire into property, and what fortune is\nrequisite for a man to live on, and how and in what manner they ought\nto employ it; for there are many doubts upon this question, while each\nparty insists upon their own plan of life being carried to an excess,\nthe one of severity, the other of indulgence. What the situation of the\ncountry should be it is not difficult to determine, in some particulars\nrespecting that we ought to be advised by those who are skilful in\nmilitary affairs. It should be difficult of access to an enemy, but\neasy to the inhabitants: and as we said, that the number of [1327a]\ninhabitants ought to be such as can come under the eye of the\nmagistrate, so should it be with the country; for then it is easily\ndefended. As to the position of the city, if one could place it to one's\nwish, it is convenient to fix it on the seaside: with respect to\nthe country, one situation which it ought to have has been already\nmentioned, namely, that it should be so placed as easily to give\nassistance to all places, and also to receive the necessaries of life\nfrom all parts, and also wood, or any other materials which may happen\nto be in the country.\nCHAPTER VI\nBut with respect to placing a city in the neighbourhood of the sea,\nthere are some who have many doubts whether it is serviceable or hurtful\nto a well-regulated state; for they say, that the resort of persons\nbrought up under a different system of government is disserviceable\nto the state, as well by impeding the laws as by their numbers; for a\nmultitude of merchants must necessarily arise from their trafficking\nbackward and forward upon the seas, which will hinder the well-governing\nof the city: but if this inconvenience should not arise, it is evident\nthat it is better, both on account of safety and also for the easier\nacquisition of the necessaries of life, that both the city and the\ncountry should be near the sea; for it is necessary that those who are\nto sustain the attack of the enemy should be ready with their assistance\nboth by land and by sea, and to oppose any inroad, both ways if possible\nbut if not, at least where they are most powerful, which they may\ndo while they possess both. A maritime situation is also useful for\nreceiving from others what your own country will not produce, and\nexporting those necessaries of your own growth which are more than you\nhave occasion for; but a city ought to traffic to supply its own wants,\nand not the wants of others; for those who themselves furnish an open\nmarket for every one, do it for the sake of gain; which it is not proper\nfor a well-established state to do, neither should they encourage such\na commerce. Now, as we see that many places and cities have docks and\nharbours lying very convenient for the city, while those who frequent\nthem have no communication with the citadel, and yet they are not too\nfar off, but are surrounded by walls and such-like fortifications, it is\nevident, that if any good arises from such an intercourse the city will\nreceive it, but if anything hurtful, it will be easy to restrain it by\na law declaring and deputing whom the state will allow to have an\nintercourse with each other, and whom not. As to a naval power, it is by\nno means doubtful that it is necessary to have one to a certain degree;\nand this not only for the sake of the [1327b] city itself, but also\nbecause it may be necessary to appear formidable to some of the\nneighbouring states, or to be able to assist them as well by sea as\nby land; but to know how great that force should be, the health of the\nstate should be inquired into, and if that appears vigorous and enables\nher to take the lead of other communities, it is necessary that her\nforce should correspond with her actions. As for that multitude of\npeople which a maritime power creates, they are by no means necessary to\na state, nor ought they to make a part of the citizens; for the mariners\nand infantry, who have the command, are freemen, and upon these depends\na naval engagement: but when there are many servants and husbandmen,\nthere they will always have a number of sailors, as we now see happens\nto some states, as in Heraclea, where they man many triremes, though\nthe extent of their city is much inferior to some others. And thus we\ndetermine concerning the country, the port, the city, the sea, and a\nmaritime power: as to the number of the citizens, what that ought to be\nwe have already said.\nCHAPTER VII\nWe now proceed to point out what natural disposition the members of the\ncommunity ought to be of: but this any one will easily perceive who\nwill cast his eye over the states of Greece, of all others the most\ncelebrated, and also the other different nations of this habitable\nworld. Those who live in cold countries, as the north of Europe, are\nfull of courage, but wanting in understanding and the arts: therefore\nthey are very tenacious of their liberty; but, not being politicians,\nthey cannot reduce their neighbours under their power: but the Asiatics,\nwhose understandings are quick, and who are conversant in the arts, are\ndeficient in courage; and therefore are always conquered and the\nslaves of others: but the Grecians, placed as it were between these\ntwo boundaries, so partake of them both as to be at the same time both\ncourageous and sensible; for which reason Greece continues free, and\ngoverned in the best manner possible, and capable of commanding the\nwhole world, could they agree upon one system of policy. Now this is the\ndifference between the Grecians and other nations, that the latter have\nbut one of these qualities, whereas in the former they are both happily\nblended together. Hence it is evident, that those persons ought to be\nboth sensible and courageous who will readily obey a legislator, the\nobject of whose laws is virtue. As to what some persons say, that the\nmilitary must be mild and tender to those they know, but severe and\ncruel to those they know not, it is courage which [1328a] makes any one\nlovely; for that is the faculty of the soul which we most admire: as\na proof of this, our resentment rises higher against our friends and\nacquaintance than against those we know not: for which reason Archilaus\naccusing his friends says very properly to himself, Shall my friends\ninsult me? The spirit of freedom and command also is what all inherit\nwho are of this disposition for courage is commanding and invincible. It\nalso is not right for any one to say, that you should be severe to those\nyou know not; for this behaviour is proper for no one: nor are those who\nare of a noble disposition harsh in their manners, excepting only to the\nwicked; and when they are particularly so, it is, as has been already\nsaid, against their friends, when they think they have injured them;\nwhich is agreeable to reason: for when those who think they ought to\nreceive a favour from any one do not receive it, beside the injury done\nthem, they consider what they are deprived of: hence the saying, \"Cruel\nare the wars of brothers;\" and this, \"Those who have greatly loved\ndo greatly hate.\" And thus we have nearly determined how many the\ninhabitants of a city ought to be, and what their natural disposition,\nand also the country how large, and of what sort is necessary; I say\nnearly, because it is needless to endeavour at as great accuracy in\nthose things which are the objects of the senses as in those which are\ninquired into by the understanding only.\nCHAPTER VIII\nAs in natural bodies those things are not admitted to be parts of them\nwithout which the whole would not exist, so also it is evident that in\na political state everything that is necessary thereunto is not to be\nconsidered as a part of it, nor any other community from whence one\nwhole is made; for one thing ought to be common and the same to the\ncommunity, whether they partake of it equally or unequally, as, for\ninstance, food, land, or the like; but when one thing is for the benefit\nof one person, and another for the benefit of another, in this there is\nnothing like a community, excepting that one makes it and the other\nuses it; as, for instance, between any instrument employed in making any\nwork, and the workmen, as there is nothing common between the house and\nthe builder, but the art of the builder is employed on the house. Thus\nproperty is necessary for states, but property is no part of the state,\nthough many species of it have life; but a city is a community of\nequals, for the purpose of enjoying the best life possible: but the\nhappiest life is the best which consists in the perfect practice of\nvirtuous energies: as therefore some persons have great, others little\nor no opportunity of being employed in these, it is evident that this\nis the cause of the difference there is between the different cities and\ncommunities there are to be found; for while each of these endeavour to\nacquire what is best by various and different means, they give [1328b]\nrise to different modes of living and different forms of government. We\nare now to consider what those things are without which a city cannot\npossibly exist; for what we call parts of the city must of necessity\ninhere in it: and this we shall plainly understand, if we know the\nnumber of things necessary to a city: first, the inhabitants must\nhave food: secondly, arts, for many instruments are necessary in life:\nthirdly, arms, for it is necessary that the community should have an\narmed force within themselves, both to support their government against\nthose of their own body who might refuse obedience to it, and also\nto defend it from those who might attempt to attack it from without:\nfourthly, a certain revenue, as well for the internal necessities of\nthe state as for the business of war: fifthly, which is indeed the chief\nconcern, a religious establishment: sixthly in order, but first of all\nin necessity, a court to determine both criminal and civil causes. These\nthings are absolutely necessary, so to speak, in every state; for a city\nis a number of people not accidentally met together, but with a purpose\nof ensuring to themselves sufficient independency and self-protection;\nand if anything necessary for these purposes is wanting, it is\nimpossible that in such a situation these ends can be obtained. It is\nnecessary therefore that a city should be capable of acquiring all these\nthings: for this purpose a proper number of husbandmen are necessary to\nprocure food, also artificers and soldiers, and rich men, and priests\nand judges, to determine what is right and proper.\nCHAPTER IX\nHaving determined thus far, it remains that we consider whether all\nthese different employments shall be open to all; for it is possible\nto continue the same persons always husbandmen, artificers, judges,\nor counsellors; or shall we appoint different persons to each of those\nemployments which we have already mentioned; or shall some of them be\nappropriated to particulars, and others of course common to all? but\nthis does not take place in every state, for, as we have already said,\nit is possible that all may be common to all, or not, but only common to\nsome; and this is the difference between one government and another:\nfor in democracies the whole community partakes of everything, but in\noligarchies it is different.\nSince we are inquiring what is the best government possible, and it is\nadmitted to be that in which the citizens are happy; and that, as we\nhave already said, it is impossible to obtain happiness without virtue;\nit follows, that in the best-governed states, where the citizens are\nreally men of intrinsic and not relative goodness, none of them should\nbe permitted to exercise any mechanic employment or follow merchandise,\nas being ignoble and destructive to virtue; neither should they be\nhusband-[1329a] men, that they may be at leisure to improve in virtue\nand perform the duty they owe to the state. With respect to the\nemployments of a soldier, a senator, and a judge, which are evidently\nnecessary to the community, shall they be allotted to different persons,\nor shall the same person execute both? This question, too, is easily\nanswered: for in some cases the same persons may execute them, in\nothers they should be different, where the different employments require\ndifferent abilities, as when courage is wanting for one, judgment for\nthe other, there they should be allotted to different persons; but when\nit is evident, that it is impossible to oblige those who have arms\nin their hands, and can insist on their own terms, to be always under\ncommand; there these different employments should be trusted to one\nperson; for those who have arms in their hands have it in their option\nwhether they will or will not assume the supreme power: to these two\n(namely, those who have courage and judgment) the government must be\nentrusted; but not in the same manner, but as nature directs; what\nrequires courage to the young, what requires judgment to the old; for\nwith the young is courage, with the old is wisdom: thus each will be\nallotted the part they are fit for according to their different merits.\nIt is also necessary that the landed property should belong to these\nmen; for it is necessary that the citizens should be rich, and these are\nthe men proper for citizens; for no mechanic ought to be admitted to the\nrights of a citizen, nor any other sort of people whose employment is\nnot entirely noble, honourable, and virtuous; this is evident from the\nprinciple we at first set out with; for to be happy it is necessary\nto be virtuous; and no one should say that a city is happy while he\nconsiders only one part of its citizens, but for that purpose he ought\nto examine into all of them. It is evident, therefore, that the landed\nproperty should belong to these, though it may be necessary for them to\nhave husbandmen, either slaves, barbarians, or servants. There remains\nof the different classes of the people whom we have enumerated, the\npriests, for these evidently compose a rank by themselves; for neither\nare they to be reckoned amongst the husbandmen nor the mechanics; for\nreverence to the gods is highly becoming every state: and since the\ncitizens have been divided into orders, the military and the council,\nand it is proper to offer due worship to the gods, and since it is\nnecessary that those who are employed in their service should have\nnothing else to do, let the business of the priesthood be allotted\nto those who are in years. We have now shown what is necessary to the\nexistence of a city, and of what parts it consists, and that husbandmen,\nmechanic, and mercenary servants are necessary to a city; but that\nthe parts of it are soldiers and sailors, and that these are always\ndifferent from those, but from each other only occasionally.\nCHAPTER X\nIt seems neither now nor very lately to have been known [1329b] to those\nphilosophers who have made politics their study, that a city ought to\nbe divided by families into different orders of men; and that the\nhusbandmen and soldiers should be kept separate from each other;\nwhich custom is even to this day preserved in Egypt and in Crete; also\nSesostris having founded it in Egypt, Minos in Crete. Common meals seem\nalso to have been an ancient regulation, and to have been established\nin Crete during the reign of Minos, and in a still more remote period\nin Italy; for those who are the best judges in that country say that\none Italus being king of AEnotria., from whom the people, changing their\nnames, were called Italians instead of AEnotrians, and that part of\nEurope was called Italy which is bounded by the Scylletic Gulf on the\none side and the Lametic on the other, the distance between which\nis about half a day's journey. This Italus, they relate, made the\nAEnotrians, who were formerly shepherds, husbandmen, and gave them\ndifferent laws from what they had before, and to have been the first who\nestablished common meals, for which reason some of his descendants still\nuse them, and observe some of his laws. The Opici inhabit that part\nwhich lies towards the Tyrrhenian Sea, who both now are and formerly\nwere called Ausonians. The Chones inhabited the part toward Iapigia and\nthe Ionian Sea which is called Syrtis. These Chones were descended\nfrom the AEnotrians. Hence arose the custom of common meals, but the\nseparation of the citizens into different families from Egypt: for the\nreign of Sesostris is of much higher antiquity than that of Minos. As\nwe ought to think that most other things were found out in a long, nay,\neven in a boundless time (reason teaching us that want would make us\nfirst invent that which was necessary, and, when that was obtained, then\nthose things which were requisite for the conveniences and ornament of\nlife), so should we conclude the same with respect to a political state;\nnow everything in Egypt bears the marks of the most remote antiquity,\nfor these people seem to be the most ancient of all others, and to have\nacquired laws and political order; we should therefore make a proper\nuse of what is told us of them, and endeavour to find out what they have\nomitted. We have already said, that the landed property ought to belong\nto the military and those who partake of the government of the state;\nand that therefore the husbandmen should be a separate order of people;\nand how large and of what nature the country ought to be: we will first\ntreat of the division of the land, and of the husbandmen, how many and\nof what sort they ought to be; since we by no means hold that property\nought to be common, as some persons have said, only thus far, in\nfriendship, it [1330a] should be their custom to let no citizen want\nsubsistence. As to common meals, it is in general agreed that they are\nproper in well-regulated cities; my reasons for approving of them shall\nbe mentioned hereafter: they are what all the citizens ought to partake\nof; but it will not be easy for the poor, out of what is their own, to\nfurnish as much as they are ordered to do, and supply their own house\nbesides. The expense also of religious worship should be defrayed by the\nwhole state. Of necessity therefore the land ought to be divided into\ntwo parts, one of which should belong to the community in general, the\nother to the individuals separately; and each of these parts should\nagain be subdivided into two: half of that which belongs to the public\nshould be appropriated to maintain the worship of the gods, the other\nhalf to support the common meals. Half of that which belongs to the\nindividuals should be at the extremity of the country, the other half\nnear the city, so that these two portions being allotted to each person,\nall would partake of land in both places, which would be both equal and\nright; and induce them to act in concert with greater harmony in any war\nwith their neighbours: for when the land is not divided in this manner,\none party neglects the inroads of the enemy on the borders, the other\nmakes it a matter of too much consequence and more than is necessary;\nfor which reason in some places there is a law which forbids the\ninhabitants of the borders to have any vote in the council when they are\ndebating upon a war which is made against them as their private interest\nmight prevent their voting impartially. Thus therefore the country ought\nto be divided and for the reasons before mentioned. Could one have one's\nchoice, the husbandmen should by all means be slaves, not of the same\nnation, or men of any spirit; for thus they would be laborious in\ntheir business, and safe from attempting any novelties: next to these\nbarbarian servants are to be preferred, similar in natural disposition\nto these we have already mentioned. Of these, let those who are\nto cultivate the private property of the individual belong to that\nindividual, and those who are to cultivate the public territory belong\nto the public. In what manner these slaves ought to be used, and for\nwhat reason it is very proper that they should have the promise of their\nliberty made them, as a reward for their services, shall be mentioned\nhereafter.\nCHAPTER XI\nWe have already mentioned, that both the city and all the country should\ncommunicate both with the sea and the continent as much as possible.\nThere are these four things which we should be particularly desirous of\nin the position of the city with respect to itself: in the first place,\nhealth is to be consulted as the first thing necessary: now a city\nwhich fronts the east and receives the winds which blow from thence is\nesteemed most healthful; next to this that which has a northern position\nis to be preferred, as best in winter. It should next be contrived that\nit may have a proper situation for the business of government and for\ndefence in war: that in war the citizens may [1330b] have easy access\nto it; but that it may be difficult of access to, and hardly to be taken\nby, the enemy. In the next place particularly, that there may be plenty\nof water, and rivers near at hand: but if those cannot be found, very\nlarge cisterns must be prepared to save rain-water, so that there may\nbe no want of it in case they should be driven into the town in time of\nwar. And as great care should be taken of the health of the inhabitants,\nthe first thing to be attended to is, that the city should have a good\nsituation and a good position; the second is, that they may have good\nwater to drink; and this not be negligently taken care of; for what\nwe chiefly and most frequently use for the support of the body must\nprincipally influence the health of it; and this influence is what the\nair and water naturally have: for which reason in all wise governments\nthe waters ought to be appropriated to different purposes, and if they\nare not equally good, and if there is not a plenty of necessary water,\nthat which is to drink should be separated from that which is for other\nuses. As to fortified places, what is proper for some governments is\nnot proper for all; as, for instance, a lofty citadel is proper for a\nmonarchy and an oligarchy; a city built upon a plain suits a democracy;\nneither of these for an aristocracy, but rather many strong places. As\nto the form of private houses, those are thought to be best and most\nuseful for their different purposes which are distinct and separate\nfrom each other, and built in the modern manner, after the plan of\nHippodamus: but for safety in time of war, on the contrary, they should\nbe built as they formerly were; for they were such that strangers could\nnot easily find their way out of them, and the method of access to\nthem such as an enemy could with difficulty find out if he proposed\nto besiege them. A city therefore should have both these sorts of\nbuildings, which may easily be contrived if any one will so regulate\nthem as the planters do their rows of vines; not that the buildings\nthroughout the city should be detached from each other, only in some\nparts of it; thus elegance and safety will be equally consulted. With\nrespect to walls, those who say that a courageous people ought not to\nhave any, pay too much respect to obsolete notions; particularly as\nwe may see those who pride themselves therein continually confuted by\nfacts. It is indeed disreputable for those who are equal, or nearly so,\nto the enemy, to endeavour to take refuge within their walls--but since\nit very often happens, that those who make the attack are too powerful\nfor the bravery and courage of those few who oppose them to resist,\nif you would not suffer the calamities of war and the insolence of the\nenemy, it must be thought the part of a good soldier to seek for safety\nunder the shelter and protection of walls more especially since so many\nmissile weapons and machines have been most ingeniously invented to\nbesiege cities with. Indeed to neglect surrounding a city with a wall\nwould be similar to choosing a country which is easy of access to an\nenemy, or levelling the eminences of it; or as if an individual should\nnot have a wall to his house lest it should be thought that the owner\nof it was a coward: nor should this be left unconsidered, that those who\nhave a city surrounded with walls may act both ways, either as if it had\nor as if it had not; but where it has not they cannot do this. If this\nis true, it is not only necessary to have walls, but care must be taken\nthat they may be a proper ornament to the city, as well as a defence\nin time of war; not only according to the old methods, but the modern\nimprovements also: for as those who make offensive war endeavour by\nevery way possible to gain advantages over their adversaries, so should\nthose who are upon the defensive employ all the means already known, and\nsuch new ones as philosophy can invent, to defend themselves: for those\nwho are well prepared are seldom first attacked.\nCHAPTER XII\nAs the citizens in general are to eat at public tables in certain\ncompanies, and it is necessary that the walls should have bulwarks and\ntowers in proper places and at proper distances, it is evident that\nit will be very necessary to have some of these in the towers; let the\nbuildings for this purpose be made the ornaments of the walls. As to\ntemples for public worship, and the hall for the public tables of\nthe chief magistrates, they ought to be built in proper places, and\ncontiguous to each other, except those temples which the law or the\noracle orders to be separate from all other buildings; and let these be\nin such a conspicuous eminence, that they may have every advantage of\nsituation, and in the neighbourhood of that part of the city which\nis best fortified. Adjoining to this place there ought to be a large\nsquare, like that which they call in Thessaly The Square of Freedom, in\nwhich nothing is permitted to be bought or sold; into which no mechanic\nnor husbandman, nor any such person, should be permitted to enter,\nunless commanded by the magistrates. It will also be an ornament to this\nplace if the gymnastic exercises of the elders are performed in it. It\nis also proper, that for performing these exercises the citizens should\nbe divided into distinct classes, according to their ages, and that the\nyoung persons should have proper officers to be with them, and that the\nseniors should be with the magistrates; for having them before their\neyes would greatly inspire true modesty and ingenuous fear. There ought\nto be another square [1331b] separate from this for buying and selling,\nwhich should be so situated as to be commodious for the reception\nof goods both by sea and land. As the citizens may be divided into\nmagistrates and priests, it is proper that the public tables of\nthe priests should be in buildings near the temples. Those of the\nmagistrates who preside over contracts, indictments, and such-like, and\nalso over the markets, and the public streets near the square, or some\npublic way, I mean the square where things are bought and sold; for I\nintended the other for those who are at leisure, and this for necessary\nbusiness. The same order which I have directed here should be observed\nalso in the country; for there also their magistrates such as the\nsurveyors of the woods and overseers of the grounds, must necessarily\nhave their common tables and their towers, for the purpose of protection\nagainst an enemy. There ought also to be temples erected at proper\nplaces, both to the gods and the heroes; but it is unnecessary to dwell\nlonger and most minutely on these particulars--for it is by no means\ndifficult to plan these things, it is rather so to carry them into\nexecution; for the theory is the child of our wishes, but the practical\npart must depend upon fortune; for which reason we shall decline saying\nanything farther upon these subjects.\nCHAPTER XIII\nWe will now show of what numbers and of what sort of people a government\nought to consist, that the state may be happy and well administered.\nAs there are two particulars on which the excellence and perfection of\neverything depend, one of these is, that the object and end proposed\nshould be proper; the other, that the means to accomplish it should be\nadapted to that purpose; for it may happen that these may either agree\nor disagree with each other; for the end we propose may be good, but in\ntaking the means to obtain it we may err; at other times we may have\nthe right and proper means in our power, but the end may be bad,\nand sometimes we may mistake in both; as in the art of medicine the\nphysician does not sometimes know in what situation the body ought to\nbe, to be healthy; nor what to do to procure the end he aims at. In\nevery art and science, therefore, we should be master of this knowledge,\nnamely, the proper end, and the means to obtain it. Now it is evident\nthat all persons are desirous to live well and be happy; but that some\nhave the means thereof in their own power, others not; and this either\nthrough nature [1332a] or fortune; for many ingredients are necessary to\na happy life; but fewer to those who are of a good than to those who are\nof a bad disposition. There are others who continually have the means\nof happiness in their own power, but do not rightly apply them. Since\nwe propose to inquire what government is best, namely, that by which\na state may be best administered, and that state is best administered\nwhere the people are the happiest, it is evident that happiness is a\nthing we should not be unacquainted with. Now, I have already said in\nmy treatise on Morals (if I may here make any use of what I have there\nshown), that happiness consists in the energy and perfect practice of\nvirtue; and this not relatively, but simply; I mean by relatively, what\nis necessary in some certain circumstances; by simply, what is good and\nfair in itself: of the first sort are just punishments, and restraints\nin a just cause; for they arise from virtue and are necessary, and on\nthat account are virtuous; though it is more desirable that neither any\nstate nor any individual should stand in need of them; but those actions\nwhich are intended either to procure honour or wealth are simply good;\nthe others eligible only to remove an evil; these, on the contrary, are\nthe foundation and means of relative good. A worthy man indeed will bear\npoverty, disease, and other unfortunate accidents with a noble mind;\nbut happiness consists in the contrary to these (now we have already\ndetermined in our treatise on Morals, that he is a man of worth who\nconsiders what is good because it is virtuous as what is simply good; it\nis evident, therefore, that all the actions of such a one must be worthy\nand simply good): this has led some persons to conclude, that the cause\nof happiness was external goods; which would be as if any one should\nsuppose that the playing well upon the lyre was owing to the instrument,\nand not to the art. It necessarily follows from what has been said,\nthat some things should be ready at hand and others procured by the\nlegislator; for which reason in founding a city we earnestly wish that\nthere may be plenty of those things which are supposed to be under the\ndominion of fortune (for some things we admit her to be mistress over);\nbut for a state to be worthy and great is not only the work of fortune\nbut of knowledge and judgment also. But for a state to be worthy it is\nnecessary that those citizens which are in the administration should\nbe worthy also; but as in our city every citizen is to be so, we must\nconsider how this may be accomplished; for if this is what every one\ncould be, and not some individuals only, it would be more desirable; for\nthen it would follow, that what might be done by one might be done\nby all. Men are worthy and good three ways; by nature, by custom, by\nreason. In the first place, a man ought to be born a man, and not any\nother animal; that is to say, he ought to have both a body and soul; but\nit avails not to be only born [1332b] with some things, for custom\nmakes great alterations; for there are some things in nature capable of\nalteration either way which are fixed by custom, either for the better\nor the worse. Now, other animals live chiefly a life of nature; and in\nvery few things according to custom; but man lives according to reason\nalso, which he alone is endowed with; wherefore he ought to make all\nthese accord with each other; for if men followed reason, and were\npersuaded that it was best to obey her, they would act in many respects\ncontrary to nature and custom. What men ought naturally to be, to make\ngood members of a community, I have already determined; the rest of\nthis discourse therefore shall be upon education; for some things are\nacquired by habit, others by hearing them.\nCHAPTER XIV\nAs every political community consists of those who govern and of those\nwho are governed, let us consider whether during the continuance of\ntheir lives they ought to be the same persons or different; for it\nis evident that the mode of education should be adapted to this\ndistinction. Now, if one man differed from another as much, as we\nbelieve, the gods and heroes differ from men: in the first place, being\nfar their superiors in body; and, secondly, in the soul: so that the\nsuperiority of the governors over the governed might be evident beyond\na doubt, it is certain that it would be better for the one always to\ngovern, the other always to be governed: but, as this is not easy to\nobtain, and kings are not so superior to those they govern as Scylax\ninforms us they are in India, it is evident that for many reasons it is\nnecessary that all in their turns should both govern and be governed:\nfor it is just that those who are equal should have everything alike;\nand it is difficult for a state to continue which is founded in\ninjustice; for all those in the country who are desirous of innovation\nwill apply themselves to those who are under the government of the rest,\nand such will be their numbers in the state, that it will be impossible\nfor the magistrates to get the better of them. But that the governors\nought to excel the governed is beyond a doubt; the legislator therefore\nought to consider how this shall be, and how it may be contrived that\nall shall have their equal share in the administration. Now, with\nrespect to this it will be first said, that nature herself has directed\nus in our choice, laying down the selfsame thing when she has made some\nyoung, others old: the first of whom it becomes to obey, the latter\nto command; for no one when he is young is offended at his being under\ngovernment, or thinks himself too good for it; more especially when he\nconsiders that he himself shall receive the same honours which he\npays when he shall arrive at a proper age. In some respects it must be\nacknowledged that the governors and the governed are the same, in others\nthey are different; it is therefore necessary that their education\nshould be in [1333a] some respect the same, in others different: as they\nsay, that he will be a good governor who has first learnt to obey. Now\nof governments, as we have already said, some are instituted for the\nsake of him who commands; others for him who obeys: of the first sort is\nthat of the master over the servant; of the latter, that of freemen over\neach other. Now some things which are commanded differ from others; not\nin the business, but in the end proposed thereby: for which reason many\nworks, even of a servile nature, are not disgraceful for young freemen\nto perform; for many things which are ordered to be done are not\nhonourable or dishonourable so much in their own nature as in the end\nwhich is proposed, and the reason for which they are undertaken. Since\nthen we have determined, that the virtue of a good citizen and good\ngovernor is the same as of a good man; and that every one before he\ncommands should have first obeyed, it is the business of the legislator\nto consider how his citizens may be good men, what education is\nnecessary to that purpose, and what is the final object of a good life.\nThe soul of man may be divided into two parts; that which has reason in\nitself, and that which hath not, but is capable of obeying its dictates:\nand according to the virtues of these two parts a man is said to be\ngood: but of those virtues which are the ends, it will not be difficult\nfor those to determine who adopt the division I have already given; for\nthe inferior is always for the sake of the superior; and this is equally\nevident both in the works of art as well as in those of nature; but that\nis superior which has reason. Reason itself also is divided into\ntwo parts, in the manner we usually divide it; the theoretic and the\npractical; which division therefore seems necessary for this part also:\nthe same analogy holds good with respect to actions; of which those\nwhich are of a superior nature ought always to be chosen by those who\nhave it in their power; for that is always most eligible to every one\nwhich will procure the best ends. Now life is divided into labour and\nrest, war and peace; and of what we do the objects are partly necessary\nand useful, partly noble: and we should give the same preference to\nthese that we do to the different parts of the soul and its actions,\nas war to procure peace; labour, rest; and the useful, the noble. The\npolitician, therefore, who composes a body of laws ought to extend his\nviews to everything; the different parts of the soul and their actions;\nmore particularly to those things which are of a superior nature and\nends; and, in the same manner, to the lives of men and their different\nactions.\nThey ought to be fitted both for labour and war, but rather [1333b] for\nrest and peace; and also to do what is necessary and useful, but rather\nwhat is fair and noble. It is to those objects that the education of the\nchildren ought to tend, and of all the youths who want instruction. All\nthe Grecian states which now seem best governed, and the legislators who\nfounded those states, appear not to have framed their polity with a view\nto the best end, or to every virtue, in their laws and education; but\neagerly to have attended to what is useful and productive of gain: and\nnearly of the same opinion with these are some persons who have written\nlately, who, by praising the Lacedaemonian state, show they approve of\nthe intention of the legislator in making war and victory the end of\nhis government. But how contrary to reason this is, is easily proved by\nargument, and has already been proved by facts (but as the generality of\nmen desire to have an extensive command, that they may have everything\ndesirable in the greater abundance; so Thibron and others who have\nwritten on that state seem to approve of their legislator for having\nprocured them an extensive command by continually enuring them to\nall sorts of dangers and hardships): for it is evident, since the\nLacedemonians have now no hope that the supreme power will be in their\nown hand, that neither are they happy nor was their legislator wise.\nThis also is ridiculous, that while they preserved an obedience to their\nlaws, and no one opposed their being governed by them, they lost the\nmeans of being honourable: but these people understand not rightly\nwhat sort of government it is which ought to reflect honour on the\nlegislator; for a government of freemen is nobler than despotic power,\nand more consonant to virtue. Moreover, neither should a city be thought\nhappy, nor should a legislator be commended, because he has so trained\nthe people as to conquer their neighbours; for in this there is a\ngreat inconvenience: since it is evident that upon this principle every\ncitizen who can will endeavour to procure the supreme power in his own\ncity; which crime the Lacedaemonians accuse Pausanias of, though he\nenjoyed such great honours.\nSuch reasoning and such laws are neither political, useful nor true: but\na legislator ought to instil those laws on the minds of men which are\nmost useful for them, both in their public and private capacities. The\nrendering a people fit for war, that they may enslave their inferiors\nought not to be the care of the legislator; but that they may not\nthemselves be reduced to slavery by others. In [1334a] the next place,\nhe should take care that the object of his government is the safety\nof those who are under it, and not a despotism over all: in the third\nplace, that those only are slaves who are fit to be only so. Reason\nindeed concurs with experience in showing that all the attention which\nthe legislator pays to the business of war, and all other rules which\nhe lays down, should have for their object rest and peace; since most\nof those states (which we usually see) are preserved by war; but, after\nthey have acquired a supreme power over those around them, are ruined;\nfor during peace, like a sword, they lose their brightness: the fault of\nwhich lies in the legislator, who never taught them how to be at rest.\nCHAPTER XV\nAs there is one end common to a man both as an individual and a citizen,\nit is evident that a good man and a good citizen must have the same\nobject in view; it is evident that all the virtues which lead to rest\nare necessary; for, as we have often said, the end of war is peace, of\nlabour, rest; but those virtues whose object is rest, and those also\nwhose object is labour, are necessary for a liberal life and rest; for\nwe want a supply of many necessary things that we may be at rest. A city\ntherefore ought to be temperate, brave, and patient; for, according to\nthe proverb, \"Rest is not for slaves;\" but those who cannot bravely face\ndanger are the slaves of those who attack them. Bravery, therefore, and\npatience are necessary for labour, philosophy for rest, and temperance\nand justice in both; but these chiefly in time of peace and rest; for\nwar obliges men to be just and temperate; but the enjoyment of pleasure,\nwith the rest of peace, is more apt to produce insolence; those indeed\nwho are easy in their circumstances, and enjoy everything that can\nmake them happy, have great occasion for the virtues of temperance and\njustice. Thus if there are, as the poets tell us, any inhabitants in\nthe happy isles, to these a higher degree of philosophy, temperance, and\njustice will be necessary, as they live at their ease in the full plenty\nof every sensual pleasure. It is evident, therefore, that these virtues\nare necessary in every state that would be happy or worthy; for he who\nis worthless can never enjoy real good, much less is he qualified to\nbe at rest; but can appear good only by labour and being at war, but\nin peace and at rest the meanest of creatures. For which reason virtue\nshould not be cultivated as the Lacedaemonians did; for they did not\ndiffer from others in their opinion concerning the supreme good, but in\n[1334b] imagining this good was to be procured by a particular virtue;\nbut since there are greater goods than those of war, it is evident\nthat the enjoyment of those which are valuable in themselves should be\ndesired, rather than those virtues which are useful in war; but how and\nby what means this is to be acquired is now to be considered. We have\nalready assigned three causes on which it will depend; nature, custom,\nand reason, arid shown what sort of men nature must produce for this\npurpose; it remains then that we determine which we shall first begin by\nin education, reason or custom, for these ought always to preserve the\nmost entire harmony with each other; for it may happen that reason may\nerr from the end proposed, and be corrected by custom. In the first\nplace, it is evident that in this as in other things, its beginning\nor production arises from some principle, and its end also arises from\nanother principle, which is itself an end. Now, with us, reason and\nintelligence are the end of nature; our production, therefore, and our\nmanners ought to be accommodated to both these. In the next place, as\nthe soul and the body are two distinct things, so also we see that the\nsoul is divided into two parts, the reasoning and not-reasoning, with\ntheir habits which are two in number, one belonging to each, namely\nappetite and intelligence; and as the body is in production before the\nsoul, so is the not-reasoning part of the soul before the reasoning; and\nthis is evident; for anger, will and desire are to be seen in children\nnearly as soon as they are born; but reason and intelligence spring up\nas they grow to maturity. The body, therefore, necessarily demands our\ncare before the soul; next the appetites for the sake of the mind; the\nbody for the sake of the soul.\nCHAPTER XVI\nIf then the legislator ought to take care that the bodies of the\nchildren are as perfect as possible, his first attention ought to be\ngiven to matrimony; at what time and in what situation it is proper that\nthe citizens should engage in the nuptial contract. Now, with respect\nto this alliance, the legislator ought both to consider the parties and\ntheir time of life, that they may grow old at the same part of time, and\nthat their bodily powers may not be different; that is to say, the man\nbeing able to have children, but the woman too old to bear them; or, on\nthe contrary, the woman be young enough to produce children, but the man\ntoo old to be a father; for from such a situation discords and disputes\ncontinually arise. In the next place, with respect to the succession of\nchildren, there ought not to be too great an interval of time between\nthem and their parents; for when there is, the parent can receive no\nbenefit from his child's affection, or the child any advantage from his\nfather's protection; [1335a] neither should the difference in years be\ntoo little, as great inconveniences may arise from it; as it prevents\nthat proper reverence being shown to a father by a boy who considers him\nas nearly his equal in age, and also from the disputes it occasions in\nthe economy of the family. But, to return from this digression, care\nought to be taken that the bodies of the children may be such as will\nanswer the expectations of the legislator; this also will be affected\nby the same means. Since season for the production of children is\ndetermined (not exactly, but to speak in general), namely, for the man\ntill seventy years, and the woman till fifty, the entering into the\nmarriage state, as far as time is concerned, should be regulated by\nthese periods. It is extremely bad for the children when the father\nis too young; for in all animals whatsoever the parts of the young are\nimperfect, and are more likely to be productive of females than males,\nand diminutive also in size; the same thing of course necessarily holds\ntrue in men; as a proof of this you may see in those cities where the\nmen and women usually marry very young, the people in general are very\nsmall and ill framed; in child-birth also the women suffer more, and\nmany of them die. And thus some persons tell us the oracle of Traezenium\nshould be explained, as if it referred to the many women who were\ndestroyed by too early marriages, and not their gathering their fruits\ntoo soon. It is also conducive to temperance not to marry too soon; for\nwomen who do so are apt to be intemperate. It also prevents the bodies\nof men from acquiring their full size if they marry before their growth\nis completed; for this is the determinate period, which prevents any\nfurther increase; for which reason the proper time for a woman to marry\nis eighteen, for a man thirty-seven, a little more or less; for when\nthey marry at that time their bodies are in perfection, and they will\nalso cease to have children at a proper time; and moreover with respect\nto the succession of the children, if they have them at the time which\nmay reasonably be expected, they will be just arriving into perfection\nwhen their parents are sinking down under the load of seventy years.\nAnd thus much for the time which is proper for marriage; but moreover\na proper season of the year should be observed, as many persons do now,\nand appropriate the winter for this business. The married couple ought\nalso to regard the precepts of physicians and naturalists, each of whom\nhave treated on these [1335b] subjects. What is the fit disposition of\nthe body will be better mentioned when we come to speak of the education\nof the child; we will just slightly mention a few particulars. Now,\nthere is no occasion that any one should have the habit of body of a\nwrestler to be either a good citizen, or to enjoy a good constitution,\nor to be the father of healthy children; neither should he be infirm or\ntoo much dispirited by misfortunes, but between both these. He ought to\nhave a habit of labour, but not of too violent labour; nor should that\nbe confined to one object only, as the wrestler's is; but to such things\nas are proper for freemen. These things are equally necessary both for\nmen and women. Women with child should also take care that their diet is\nnot too sparing, and that they use sufficient exercise; which it will be\neasy for the legislator to effect if he commands them once every day\nto repair to the worship of the gods who are supposed to preside over\nmatrimony. But, contrary to what is proper for the body, the mind ought\nto be kept as tranquil as possible; for as plants partake of the nature\nof the soil, so does the child receive much of the disposition of the\nmother. With respect to the exposing or bringing up of children, let\nit be a law, that nothing imperfect or maimed shall be brought\nup,.......... As the proper time has been pointed out for a man and a\nwoman to enter into the marriage state, so also let us determine\nhow long it is advantageous for the community that they should have\nchildren; for as the children of those who are too young are imperfect\nboth in body and mind, so also those whose parents are too old are weak\nin both: while therefore the body continues in perfection, which (as\nsome poets say, who reckon the different periods of life by sevens)\nis till fifty years, or four or five more, the children may be equally\nperfect; but when the parents are past that age it is better they should\nhave no more. With respect to any connection between a man and a woman,\nor a woman and a man, when either of the parties are betrothed, let\nit be held in utter detestation [1336a] on any pretext whatsoever;\nbut should any one be guilty of such a thing after the marriage is\nconsummated, let his infamy be as great as his guilt deserves.\nCHAPTER XVII\nWhen a child is born it must be supposed that the strength of its body\nwill depend greatly upon the quality of its food. Now whoever will\nexamine into the nature of animals, and also observe those people who\nare very desirous their children should acquire a warlike habit, will\nfind that they feed them chiefly with milk, as being best accommodated\nto their bodies, but without wine, to prevent any distempers: those\nmotions also which are natural to their age are very serviceable; and\nto prevent any of their limbs from being crooked, on account of their\nextreme ductility, some people even now use particular machines that\ntheir bodies may not be distorted. It is also useful to enure them to\nthe cold when they are very little; for this is very serviceable for\ntheir health; and also to enure them to the business of war; for which\nreason it is customary with many of the barbarians to dip their children\nin rivers when the water is cold; with others to clothe them very\nslightly, as among the Celts; for whatever it is possible to accustom\nchildren to, it is best to accustom them to it at first, but to do it\nby degrees: besides, boys have naturally a habit of loving the cold, on\naccount of the heat. These, then, and such-like things ought to be the\nfirst object of our attention: the next age to this continues till\nthe child is five years old; during which time it is best to teach him\nnothing at all, not even necessary labour, lest it should hinder his\ngrowth; but he should be accustomed to use so much motion as not to\nacquire a lazy habit of body; which he will get by various means and by\nplay also: his play also ought to be neither illiberal nor too laborious\nnor lazy. Their governors and preceptors also should take care what sort\nof tales and stories it may be proper for them to hear; for all these\nought to pave the way for their future instruction: for which reason\nthe generality of their play should be imitations of what they are\nafterwards to do seriously. They too do wrong who forbid by laws\nthe disputes between boys and their quarrels, for they contribute to\nincrease their growth--as they are a sort of exercise to the body:\nfor the struggles of the heart and the compression of the spirits give\nstrength to those who labour, which happens to boys in their disputes.\nThe preceptors also ought to have an eye upon their manner of life, and\nthose with whom they converse; and to take care that they are never\nin the company of slaves. At this time and till they are seven [1336b]\nyears old it is necessary that they should be educated at home. It\nis also very proper to banish, both from their hearing and sight,\neverything which is illiberal and the like. Indeed it is as much the\nbusiness of the legislator as anything else, to banish every indecent\nexpression out of the state: for from a permission to speak whatever is\nshameful, very quickly arises the doing it, and this particularly with\nyoung people: for which reason let them never speak nor hear any such\nthing: but if it appears that any freeman has done or said anything that\nis forbidden before he is of age to be thought fit to partake of the\ncommon meals, let him be punished by disgrace and stripes; but if a\nperson above that age does so, let him be treated as you would a\nslave, on account of his being infamous. Since we forbid his speaking\neverything which is forbidden, it is necessary that he neither sees\nobscene stories nor pictures; the magistrates therefore are to take care\nthat there are no statues or pictures of anything of this nature, except\nonly to those gods to whom the law permits them, and to which the law\nallows persons of a certain age to pay their devotions, for themselves,\ntheir wives, and children. It should also be illegal for young persons\nto be present either at iambics or comedies before they are arrived at\nthat age when they are allowed to partake of the pleasures of the table:\nindeed a good education will preserve them from all the evils which\nattend on these things. We have at present just touched upon this\nsubject; it will be our business hereafter, when we properly come to\nit, to determine whether this care of children is unnecessary, or,\nif necessary, in what manner it must be done; at present we have only\nmentioned it as necessary. Probably the saying of Theodoras, the tragic\nactor, was not a bad one: That he would permit no one, not even the\nmeanest actor, to go upon the stage before him, that he might first\nengage the ear of the audience. The same thing happens both in our\nconnections with men and things: what we meet with first pleases best;\nfor which reason children should be kept strangers to everything which\nis bad, more particularly whatsoever is loose and offensive to good\nmanners. When five years are accomplished, the two next may be very\nproperly employed in being spectators of those exercises they will\nafterwards have to learn. There are two periods into which education\nought to be divided, according to the age of the child; the one is from\nhis being seven years of age to the time of puberty; the other from\nthence till he is one-and-twenty: for those who divide ages by the\nnumber seven [1337a] are in general wrong: it is much better to follow\nthe division of nature; for every art and every instruction is intended\nto complete what nature has left defective: we must first consider if\nany regulation whatsoever is requisite for children; in the next place,\nif it is advantageous to make it a common care, or that every one should\nact therein as he pleases, which is the general practice in most cities;\nin the third place, what it ought to be.\nBOOK VIII\nCHAPTER I\nNo one can doubt that the magistrate ought greatly to interest himself\nin the care of youth; for where it is neglected it is hurtful to the\ncity, for every state ought to be governed according to its particular\nnature; for the form and manners of each government are peculiar to\nitself; and these, as they originally established it, so they usually\nstill preserve it. For instance, democratic forms and manners a\ndemocracy; oligarchic, an oligarchy: but, universally, the best manners\nproduce the best government. Besides, as in every business and art there\nare some things which men are to learn first and be made accustomed to,\nwhich are necessary to perform their several works; so it is evident\nthat the same thing is necessary in the practice of virtue. As there is\none end in view in every city, it is evident that education ought to be\none and the same in each; and that this should be a common care, and\nnot the individual's, as it now is, when every one takes care of his own\nchildren separately; and their instructions are particular also, each\nperson teaching them as they please; but what ought to be engaged in\nought to be common to all. Besides, no one ought to think that any\ncitizen belongs to him in particular, but to the state in general; for\neach one is a part of the state, and it is the natural duty of each part\nto regard the good of the whole: and for this the Lacedaemonians may be\npraised; for they give the greatest attention to education, and make\nit public. It is evident, then, that there should be laws concerning\neducation, and that it should be public.\nCHAPTER II\nWhat education is, and how children ought to be instructed, is what\nshould be well known; for there are doubts concerning the business of\nit, as all people do not agree in those things they would have a child\ntaught, both with respect to their improvement in virtue and a happy\nlife: nor is it clear whether the object of it should be to improve\nthe reason or rectify the morals. From the present mode of education\nwe cannot determine with certainty to which men incline, whether to\ninstruct a child in what will be useful to him in life; or what tends to\nvirtue, and what is excellent: for all these things have their separate\ndefenders. As to virtue, there is no particular [1337b] in which they\nall agree: for as all do not equally esteem all virtues, it reasonably\nfollows that they will not cultivate the same. It is evident that what\nis necessary ought to be taught to all: but that which is necessary\nfor one is not necessary for all; for there ought to be a distinction\nbetween the employment of a freeman and a slave. The first of these\nshould be taught everything useful which will not make those who know\nit mean. Every work is to be esteemed mean, and every art and every\ndiscipline which renders the body, the mind, or the understanding of\nfreemen unfit for the habit and practice of virtue: for which reason all\nthose arts which tend to deform the body are called mean, and all those\nemployments which are exercised for gain; for they take off from the\nfreedom of the mind and render it sordid. There are also some liberal\narts which are not improper for freemen to apply to in a certain degree;\nbut to endeavour to acquire a perfect skill in them is exposed to the\nfaults I have just mentioned; for there is a great deal of difference\nin the reason for which any one does or learns anything: for it is not\nilliberal to engage in it for one's self, one's friend, or in the cause\nof virtue; while, at the same time, to do it for the sake of another\nmay seem to be acting the part of a servant and a slave. The mode of\ninstruction which now prevails seems to partake of both parts.\nCHAPTER III\nThere are four things which it is usual to teach children--reading,\ngymnastic exercises, and music, to which (in the fourth place) some add\npainting. Reading and painting are both of them of singular use in life,\nand gymnastic exercises, as productive of courage. As to music, some\npersons may doubt, as most persons now use it for the sake of pleasure:\nbut those who originally made it part of education did it because,\nas has been already said, nature requires that we should not only be\nproperly employed, but to be able to enjoy leisure honourably: for this\n(to repeat what I have already said) is of all things the principal.\nBut, though both labour and rest are necessary, yet the latter is\npreferable to the first; and by all means we ought to learn what we\nshould do when at rest: for we ought not to employ that time at play;\nfor then play would be the necessary business of our lives. But if this\ncannot be, play is more necessary for those who labour than those who\nare at rest: for he who labours requires relaxation; which play will\nsupply: for as labour is attended with pain and continued exertion, it\nis necessary that play should be introduced, under proper regulations,\nas a medicine: for such an employment of the mind is a relaxation to\nit, and eases with pleasure. [1338a] Now rest itself seems to partake of\npleasure, of happiness, and an agreeable life: but this cannot be theirs\nwho labour, but theirs who are at rest; for he who labours, labours for\nthe sake of some end which he has not: but happiness is an end which\nall persons think is attended with pleasure and not with pain: but all\npersons do not agree in making this pleasure consist in the same thing;\nfor each one has his particular standard, correspondent to his own\nhabits; but the best man proposes the best pleasure, and that which\narises from the noblest actions. But it is evident, that to live a life\nof rest there are some things which a man must learn and be instructed\nin; and that the object of this learning and this instruction centres in\ntheir acquisition: but the learning and instruction which is given for\nlabour has for its object other things; for which reason the ancients\nmade music a part of education; not as a thing necessary, for it is not\nof that nature, nor as a thing useful, as reading, in the common course\nof life, or for managing of a family, or for learning anything as useful\nin public life. Painting also seems useful to enable a man to judge\nmore accurately of the productions of the finer arts: nor is it like\nthe gymnastic exercises, which contribute to health and strength; for\nneither of these things do we see produced by music; there remains for\nit then to be the employment of our rest, which they had in view who\nintroduced it; and, thinking it a proper employment for freemen, to them\nthey allotted it; as Homer sings:\n\"How right to call Thalia to the feast:\"\nand of some others he says:\n\"The bard was call'd, to ravish every ear:\"\nand, in another place, he makes Ulysses say the happiest part of man's\nlife is\n\"When at the festal board, in order plac'd, They hear the song.\"\nIt is evident, then, that there is a certain education in which a child\nmay be instructed, not as useful nor as necessary, but as noble and\nliberal: but whether this is one or more than one, and of what sort they\nare, and how to be taught, shall be considered hereafter: we are now got\nso far on our way as to show that we have the testimony of the ancients\nin our favour, by what they have delivered down upon education--for\nmusic makes this plain. Moreover, it is necessary to instruct children\nin what is useful, not only on account of its being useful in itself,\nas, for instance, to learn to read, but also as the means of acquiring\nother different sorts of instruction: thus they should be instructed\nin painting, not only to prevent their being mistaken in purchasing\npictures, or in buying or selling of vases, but rather as it makes\n[1338b] them judges of the beauties of the human form; for to be always\nhunting after the profitable ill agrees with great and freeborn\nsouls. As it is evident whether a boy should be first taught morals or\nreasoning, and whether his body or his understanding should be first\ncultivated, it is plain that boys should be first put under the care of\nthe different masters of the gymnastic arts, both to form their bodies\nand teach them their exercises.\nCHAPTER IV\nNow those states which seem to take the greatest care of their\nchildren's education, bestow their chief attention on wrestling, though\nit both prevents the increase of the body and hurts the form of it. This\nfault the Lacedaemonians did not fall into, for they made their children\nfierce by painful labour, as chiefly useful to inspire them with\ncourage: though, as we have already often said, this is neither the\nonly thing nor the principal thing necessary to attend to; and even with\nrespect to this they may not thus attain their end; for we do not find\neither in other animals, or other nations, that courage necessarily\nattends the most cruel, but rather the milder, and those who have the\ndispositions of lions: for there are many people who are eager both\nto kill men and to devour human flesh, as the Achaeans and Heniochi in\nPontus, and many others in Asia, some of whom are as bad, others worse\nthan these, who indeed live by tyranny, but are men of no courage. Nay,\nwe know that the Lacedaemonians themselves, while they continued those\npainful labours, and were superior to all others (though now they are\ninferior to many, both in war and gymnastic exercises), did not acquire\ntheir superiority by training their youth to these exercises,\nbut because those who were disciplined opposed those who were not\ndisciplined at all. What is fair and honourable ought then to take place\nin education of what is fierce and cruel: for it is not a wolf, nor any\nother wild beast, which will brave any noble danger, but rather a good\nman. So that those who permit boys to engage too earnestly in these\nexercises, while they do not take care to instruct them in what is\nnecessary to do, to speak the real truth, render them mean and vile,\naccomplished only in one duty of a citizen, and in every other respect,\nas reason evinces, good for nothing. Nor should we form our judgments\nfrom past events, but from what we see at present: for now they have\nrivals in their mode of education, whereas formerly they had not. That\ngymnastic exercises are useful, and in what manner, is admitted; for\nduring youth it is very proper to go through a course of those which\nare most gentle, omitting that violent diet and those painful exercises\nwhich are prescribed as necessary; that they may not prevent the growth\nof the body: and it is no small proof that they have this effect, that\namongst the Olympic candidates we can scarce find two or three who have\ngained a victory both when boys and men: because the necessary exercises\nthey went through when young deprived them of their strength. When they\nhave allotted three years from the time of puberty to other parts of\neducation, they are then of a proper age to submit to labour and a\nregulated diet; for it is impossible for the mind and body both to\nlabour at the same time, as they are productive of contrary evils to\neach other; the labour of the body preventing the progress of the mind,\nand the mind of the body.\nCHAPTER V\nWith respect to music we have already spoken a little in a doubtful\nmanner upon this subject. It will be proper to go over again more\nparticularly what we then said, which may serve as an introduction to\nwhat any other person may choose to offer thereon; for it is no easy\nmatter to distinctly point out what power it has, nor on what accounts\none should apply it, whether as an amusement and refreshment, as sleep\nor wine; as these are nothing serious, but pleasing, and the killers of\ncare, as Euripides says; for which reason they class in the same order\nand use for the same purpose all these, namely, sleep, wine, and music,\nto which some add dancing; or shall we rather suppose that music tends\nto be productive of virtue, having a power, as the gymnastic exercises\nhave to form the body in a certain way, to influence the manners so as\nto accustom its professors to rejoice rightly? or shall we say, that it\nis of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant to prudence?\nfor this also is a third property which has been attributed to it. Now\nthat boys are not to be instructed in it as play is evident; for those\nwho learn don't play, for to learn is rather troublesome; neither is\nit proper to permit boys at their age to enjoy perfect leisure; for to\ncease to improve is by no means fit for what is as yet imperfect; but it\nmay be thought that the earnest attention of boys in this art is for\nthe sake of that amusement they will enjoy when they come to be men and\ncompletely formed; but, if this is the case, why are they themselves\nto learn it, and not follow the practice of the kings of the Medes and\nPersians, who enjoy the pleasure of music by hearing others play, and\nbeing shown its beauties by them; for of necessity those must be\nbetter skilled therein who make this science their particular study\nand business, than those who have only spent so much time at it as was\nsufficient just to learn the principles of it. But if this is a reason\nfor a child's being taught anything, they ought also to learn the art of\ncookery, but this is absurd. The same doubt occurs if music has a power\nof improving the manners; for why should they on this account themselves\nlearn it, and not reap every advantage of regulating the passions or\nforming a judgment [1339b] on the merits of the performance by hearing\nothers, as the Lacedaemonians; for they, without having ever learnt\nmusic, are yet able to judge accurately what is good and what is\nbad; the same reasoning may be applied if music is supposed to be the\namusement of those who live an elegant and easy life, why should they\nlearn themselves, and not rather enjoy the benefit of others' skill.\nLet us here consider what is our belief of the immortal gods in this\nparticular. Now we find the poets never represent Jupiter himself as\nsinging and playing; nay, we ourselves treat the professors of these\narts as mean people, and say that no one would practise them but a\ndrunkard or a buffoon. But probably we may consider this subject more\nat large hereafter. The first question is, whether music is or is not\nto make a part of education? and of those three things which have\nbeen assigned as its proper employment, which is the right? Is it to\ninstruct, to amuse, or to employ the vacant hours of those who live at\nrest? or may not all three be properly allotted to it? for it appears\nto partake of them all; for play is necessary for relaxation, and\nrelaxation pleasant, as it is a medicine for that uneasiness which\narises from labour. It is admitted also that a happy life must be an\nhonourable one, and a pleasant one too, since happiness consists in both\nthese; and we all agree that music is one of the most pleasing things,\nwhether alone or accompanied with a voice; as Musseus says, \"Music's the\nsweetest joy of man;\" for which reason it is justly admitted into every\ncompany and every happy life, as having the power of inspiring joy.\nSo that from this any one may suppose that it is necessary to instruct\nyoung persons in it; for all those pleasures which are harmless are not\nonly conducive to the final end of life, but serve also as relaxations;\nand, as men are but rarely in the attainment of that final end, they\noften cease from their labour and apply to amusement, with no further\nview than to acquire the pleasure attending it. It is therefore useful\nto enjoy such pleasures as these. There are some persons who make play\nand amusement their end, and probably that end has some pleasure annexed\nto it, but not what should be; but while men seek the one they accept\nthe other for it; because there is some likeness in human actions to the\nend; for the end is pursued for the sake of nothing else that attends\nit; but for itself only; and pleasures like these are sought for, not\non account of what follows them, but on account of what has gone before\nthem, as labour and grief; for which reason they seek for happiness in\nthese sort of pleasures; and that this is the reason any one may easily\nperceive. That music should be pursued, not on this account only, but\nalso as it is very serviceable during the hours of relaxation from\nlabour, probably no [1340a] one doubts; we should also inquire whether\nbesides this use it may not also have another of nobler nature--and we\nought not only to partake of the common pleasure arising from it (which\nall have the sensation of, for music naturally gives pleasure, therefore\nthe use of it is agreeable to all ages and all dispositions); but also\nto examine if it tends anything to improve our manners and our souls.\nAnd this will be easily known if we feel our dispositions any way\ninfluenced thereby; and that they are so is evident from many other\ninstances, as well as the music at the Olympic games; and this\nconfessedly fills the soul with enthusiasm; but enthusiasm is an\naffection of the soul which strongly agitates the disposition. Besides,\nall those who hear any imitations sympathise therewith; and this when\nthey are conveyed even without rhythm or verse. Moreover, as music is\none of those things which are pleasant, and as virtue itself consists in\nrightly enjoying, loving, and hating, it is evident that we ought not\nto learn or accustom ourselves to anything so much as to judge right and\nrejoice in honourable manners and noble actions. But anger and mildness,\ncourage and modesty, and their contraries, as well as all other\ndispositions of the mind, are most naturally imitated by music and\npoetry; which is plain by experience, for when we hear these our very\nsoul is altered; and he who is affected either with joy or grief by the\nimitation of any objects, is in very nearly the same situation as if he\nwas affected by the objects themselves; thus, if any person is pleased\nwith seeing a statue of any one on no other account but its beauty, it\nis evident that the sight of the original from whence it was taken\nwould also be pleasing; now it happens in the other senses there is no\nimitation of manners; that is to say, in the touch and the taste; in the\nobjects of sight, a very little; for these are merely representations of\nthings, and the perceptions which they excite are in a manner common\nto all. Besides, statues and paintings are not properly imitations of\nmanners, but rather signs and marks which show the body is affected by\nsome passion. However, the difference is not great, yet young men ought\nnot to view the paintings of Pauso, but of Polygnotus, or any other\npainter or statuary who expresses manners. But in poetry and music there\nare imitations of manners; and this is evident, for different harmonies\ndiffer from each other so much by nature, that those who hear them are\ndifferently affected, and are not in the same disposition of mind when\none is performed as when another is; the one, for instance, occasions\ngrief 13406 and contracts the soul, as the mixed Lydian: others soften\nthe mind, and as it were dissolve the heart: others fix it in a firm\nand settled state, such is the power of the Doric music only; while the\nPhrygian fills the soul with enthusiasm, as has been well described by\nthose who have written philosophically upon this part of education; for\nthey bring examples of what they advance from the things themselves. The\nsame holds true with respect to rhythm; some fix the disposition, others\noccasion a change in it; some act more violently, others more liberally.\nFrom what has been said it is evident what an influence music has over\nthe disposition of the mind, and how variously it can fascinate it:\nand if it can do this, most certainly it is what youth ought to be\ninstructed in. And indeed the learning of music is particularly adapted\nto their disposition; for at their time of life they do not willingly\nattend to anything which is not agreeable; but music is naturally one\nof the most agreeable things; and there seems to be a certain connection\nbetween harmony and rhythm; for which reason some wise men held the soul\nitself to be harmony; others, that it contains it.\nCHAPTER VI\nWe will now determine whether it is proper that children should be\ntaught to sing, and play upon any instrument, which we have before made\na matter of doubt. Now, it is well known that it makes a great deal of\ndifference when you would qualify any one in any art, for the person\nhimself to learn the practical part of it; for it is a thing very\ndifficult, if not impossible, for a man to be a good judge of what he\nhimself cannot do. It is also very necessary that children should have\nsome employment which will amuse them; for which reason the rattle of\nArchytas seems well contrived, which they give children to play with,\nto prevent their breaking those things which are about the house; for\nat their age they cannot sit still: this therefore is well adapted to\ninfants, as instruction ought to be their rattle as they grow up; hence\nit is evident that they should be so taught music as to be able to\npractise it. Nor is it difficult to say what is becoming or unbecoming\nof their age, or to answer the objections which some make to this\nemployment as mean and low. In the first place, it is necessary for them\nto practise, that they may be judges of the art: for which reason this\nshould be done when they are young; but when they are grown older the\npractical part may be dropped; while they will still continue judges of\nwhat is excellent in the art, and take a proper pleasure therein, from\nthe knowledge they acquired of it in their youth. As to the censure\nwhich some persons throw upon music, as something mean and low, it is\nnot difficult to answer that, if we will but consider how far we propose\nthose who are to be educated so as to become good citizens should be\ninstructed in this art, [1341a] and what music and what rhythms they\nshould be acquainted with; and also what instruments they should play\nupon; for in these there is probably a difference. Such then is the\nproper answer to that censure: for it must be admitted, that in some\ncases nothing can prevent music being attended, to a certain degree,\nwith the bad effects which are ascribed to it; it is therefore clear\nthat the learning of it should never prevent the business of riper\nyears; nor render the body effeminate, and unfit for the business of war\nor the state; but it should be practised by the young, judged of by the\nold. That children may learn music properly, it is necessary that they\nshould not be employed in those parts of it which are the objects of\ndispute between the masters in that science; nor should they perform\nsuch pieces as are wondered at from the difficulty of their execution;\nand which, from being first exhibited in the public games, are now\nbecome a part of education; but let them learn so much of it as to be\nable to receive proper pleasure from excellent music and rhythms; and\nnot that only which music must make all animals feel, and also slaves\nand boys, but more. It is therefore plain what instruments they should\nuse; thus, they should never be taught to play upon the flute, or any\nother instrument which requires great skill, as the harp or the like,\nbut on such as will make them good judges of music, or any other\ninstruction: besides, the flute is not a moral instrument, but rather\none that will inflame the passions, and is therefore rather to be used\nwhen the soul is to be animated than when instruction is intended. Let\nme add also, that there is something therein which is quite contrary to\nwhat education requires; as the player on the flute is prevented from\nspeaking: for which reason our forefathers very properly forbade the use\nof it to youth and freemen, though they themselves at first used it; for\nwhen their riches procured them greater leisure, they grew more animated\nin the cause of virtue; and both before and after the Median war their\nnoble actions so exalted their minds that they attended to every part of\neducation; selecting no one in particular, but endeavouring to collect\nthe whole: for which reason they introduced the flute also, as one\nof the instruments they were to learn to play on. At Lacedaemon the\nchoregus himself played on the flute; and it was so common at Athens\nthat almost every freeman understood it, as is evident from the tablet\nwhich Thrasippus dedicated when he was choregus; but afterwards they\nrejected it as dangerous; having become better judges of what tended to\npromote virtue and what did not. For the same reason many of the ancient\ninstruments were thrown aside, as the dulcimer and the lyre; as also\nthose which were to inspire those who played on them with pleasure, and\nwhich required a nice finger and great skill to play well on. What the\nancients tell us, by way of fable, of the flute is indeed very rational;\nnamely, that after Minerva had found it, she threw it away: nor are they\nwrong who say that the goddess disliked it for deforming the face of him\nwho played thereon: not but that it is more probable that she rejected\nit as the knowledge thereof contributed nothing to the improvement of\nthe mind. Now, we regard Minerva as the inventress of arts and sciences.\nAs we disapprove of a child's being taught to understand instruments,\nand to play like a master (which we would have confined to those who are\ncandidates for the prize in that science; for they play not to improve\nthemselves in virtue, but to please those who hear them, and gratify\ntheir importunity); therefore we think the practice of it unfit for\nfreemen; but then it should be confined to those who are paid for doing\nit; for it usually gives people sordid notions, for the end they have\nin view is bad: for the impertinent spectator is accustomed to make them\nchange their music; so that the artists who attend to him regulate their\nbodies according to his motions.\nCHAPTER VII\nWe are now to enter into an inquiry concerning harmony and rhythm;\nwhether all sorts of these are to be employed in education, or whether\nsome peculiar ones are to be selected; and also whether we should\ngive the same directions to those who are engaged in music as part of\neducation, or whether there is something different from these two.\nNow, as all music consists in melody and rhythm, we ought not to be\nunacquainted with the power which each of these has in education; and\nwhether we should rather choose music in which melody prevails, or\nrhythm: but when I consider how many things have been well written upon\nthese subjects, not only by some musicians of the present age, but also\nby some philosophers who are perfectly skilled in that part of music\nwhich belongs to education; we will refer those who desire a very\nparticular knowledge therein to those writers, and shall only treat\nof it in general terms, without descending to particulars. Melody is\ndivided by some philosophers, whose notions we approve of, into moral,\npractical, and that which fills the mind with enthusiasm: they also\nallot to each of these a particular kind of harmony which naturally\ncorresponds therewith: and we say that music should not be applied to\none purpose only, but many; both for instruction and purifying the soul\n(now I use the word purifying at present without any explanation, but\nshall speak more at large of it in my Poetics); and, in the third place,\nas an agreeable manner of spending the time and a relaxation from the\nuneasiness of the mind. [1342a] It is evident that all harmonies are to\nbe used; but not for all purposes; but the most moral in education: but\nto please the ear, when others play, the most active and enthusiastic;\nfor that passion which is to be found very strong in some souls is to be\nmet with also in all; but the difference in different persons consists\nin its being in a less or greater degree, as pity, fear, and enthusiasm\nalso; which latter is so powerful in some as to overpower the soul: and\nyet we see those persons, by the application of sacred music to soothe\ntheir mind, rendered as sedate and composed as if they had employed\nthe art of the physician: and this must necessarily happen to the\ncompassionate, the fearful, and all those who are subdued by their\npassions: nay, all persons, as far as they are affected with those\npassions, admit of the same cure, and are restored to tranquillity with\npleasure. In the same manner, all music which has the power of purifying\nthe soul affords a harmless pleasure to man. Such, therefore, should be\nthe harmony and such the music which those who contend with each other\nin the theatre should exhibit: but as the audience is composed of two\nsorts of people, the free and the well-instructed, the rude the mean\nmechanics, and hired servants, and a long collection of the like, there\nmust be some music and some spectacles to please and soothe them; for as\ntheir minds are as it were perverted from their natural habits, so\nalso is there an unnatural harmony, and overcharged music which is\naccommodated to their taste: but what is according to nature gives\npleasure to every one, therefore those who are to contend upon the\ntheatre should be allowed to use this species of music. But in education\nethic melody and ethic harmony should be used, which is the Doric, as we\nhave already said, or any other which those philosophers who are skilful\nin that music which is to be employed in education shall approve of.\nBut Socrates, in Plato's Republic, is very wrong when he [1342b] permits\nonly the Phrygian music to be used as well as the Doric, particularly as\namongst other instruments he banishes the flute; for the Phrygian music\nhas the same power in harmony as the flute has amongst the instruments;\nfor they are both pathetic and raise the mind: and this the practice\nof the poets proves; for in their bacchanal songs, or whenever they\ndescribe any violent emotions of the mind, the flute is the instrument\nthey chiefly use: and the Phrygian harmony is most suitable to these\nsubjects. Now, that the dithyrambic measure is Phrygian is allowed by\ngeneral consent; and those who are conversant in studies of this sort\nbring many proofs of it; as, for instance, when Philoxenus endeavoured\nto compose dithyrambic music for Doric harmony, he naturally fell back\nagain into Phrygian, as being fittest for that purpose; as every one\nindeed agrees, that the Doric music is most serious, and fittest to\ninspire courage: and, as we always commend the middle as being between\nthe two extremes, and the Doric has this relation with respect to other\nharmonies, it is evident that is what the youth ought to be instructed\nin. There are two things to be taken into consideration, both what is\npossible and what is proper; every one then should chiefly endeavour to\nattain those things which contain both these qualities: but this is to\nbe regulated by different times of life; for instance, it is not easy\nfor those who are advanced in years to sing such pieces of music as\nrequire very high notes, for nature points out to them those which are\ngentle and require little strength of voice (for which reason some who\nare skilful in music justly find fault with Socrates for forbidding the\nyouth to be instructed in gentle harmony; as if, like wine, it would\nmake them drunk, whereas the effect of that is to render men bacchanals,\nand not make them languid): these therefore are what should employ those\nwho are grown old. Moreover, if there is any harmony which is proper for\na child's age, as being at the same time elegant and instructive, as the\nLydian of all others seems chiefly to be-These then are as it were the\nthree boundaries of education, moderation, possibility, and decorum.\nINDEX\nACHILLES, 76\nAct of the city, what, 69\nActions, their original spring, i\nAdministration, 76;\nwhether to be shared
