45. Therefore God alone (or the Necessary Being) has this prerogative
   that if he be possible he must necessarily exist, and, as nothing is
   able to prevent the possibility of that which involves no bounds, no
   negation and consequently, no contradiction, this alone is sufficient
   to establish a priori his existence. We have, therefore, proved his
   existence through the reality of eternal truths. But a little while ago
   we also proved it a posteriori, because contingent beings exist which
   can have their ultimate and sufficient reason only in the necessary
   being which, in turn, has the reason for existence in itself.
