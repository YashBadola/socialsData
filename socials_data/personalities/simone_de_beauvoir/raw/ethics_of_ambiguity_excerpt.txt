The continuous work of our life is to build death. Man is a being who makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being.

The man who finds his justification in the future forms of the world, that is, in the results of his action, is the serious man. He hides his freedom from himself; he claims that the values of the world are already given, and he is content to coincide with them.

But if we are to be free, we must not flee from the ambiguity of our condition. To be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future. The existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into prison, but I am also oppressed if I am kept in a state of ignorance or if I am lied to.

We must assume our fundamental ambiguity. We are both subject and object, sovereign and crushed. We must accept this tension and act within it. To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision. And to will oneself free is also to will others free.
