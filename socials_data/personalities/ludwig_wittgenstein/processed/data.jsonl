{"text": "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\n1 The world is everything that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n2.013 Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the thing without the space.\n2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.12 The picture is a model of reality.\n3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is the picture of the world.\n3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks. What is thinkable is also possible.\n3.1 In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.\n3.14 The propositional sign is a fact.\n3.3 Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\n4 The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.\n4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means--just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced. Colloquial language is a part of the human organism and is not less complicated than it.\n4.003 Most propositions and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language. (They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful.) And so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems are really no problems.\n4.01 The proposition is a picture of reality. The proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.\n4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.\n5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n5.61 Logic fills the world: the limits of the world are also its limits. We cannot therefore say in logic: This and this there is in the world, that there is not. For that would appear to presuppose that we were excluding certain possibilities, and this cannot be the case, since it would require that logic should go beyond the limits of the world; for only in that way could it view these limits also from the other side. We cannot think what we cannot think; so what we cannot think we cannot say either.\n6 The general form of truth-function is: [p, xi, N(xi)]. This is the general form of proposition.\n6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value--and if there were, it would be of no value. If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental. What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental. It must lie outside the world.\n6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express the higher.\n6.421 It is clear, however, that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental. (Ethics and aesthetics are one.)\n6.52 We feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all. Of course there is then no question left, and just this is the answer.\n6.521 The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this problem. (Is not this the reason why men to whom after long doubting the sense of life became clear, could not then say wherein this sense consisted?)\n6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
