"The Ethics of Ambiguity"

The continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. . . . Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. "Rational animal," "thinking reed," he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, knowning the denial to be impossible, they have refused to stop there: they have proclaimed that this nonsense is nevertheless the meaning of life.

The failure of all these systems of consolidation is well known. And it is not without reason that the horizon of our era is obscured by the dark clouds of the Existentialist philosophy. Existentialism is defined by the fact that it allows the ambiguity of our condition to persist in its pure state. It is not a solipsism, since the individual is defined only by his relationship to the world and to other individuals; it exists only by being transcendent, and his transcendence implies the real presence of objects. It is not a pessimism, since it places the goal of man within himself and proposes to him no other destiny than his own liberation.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.
