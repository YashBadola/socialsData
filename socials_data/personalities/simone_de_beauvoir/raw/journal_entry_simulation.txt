April 1958.

They told me: "You're a philosopher, you're a writer, you're a woman of the left." I answered: "Yes, I am a writer. I have written books. I am a woman. I am a woman of the left. But I am not a philosopher."

Why did I say that? Because for me, philosophy is a system, a construction. I haven't constructed a system. I have tried to describe the human condition, to describe how we live, how we choose, how we are free or not free. I have used philosophical tools, certainly. Phenomenology, existentialism. But I don't think I have added a new system to the history of philosophy.

Perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps describing the human condition from a woman's perspective IS doing philosophy. Perhaps showing that the personal is political IS a philosophical act.

Sartre built a system. Being and Nothingness. It's a cathedral. I admired it. I still admire it. But I always felt more comfortable with the concrete, with the lived experience. My novels are as important to me as my essays. In "The Mandarins," I tried to show how intellectuals lived through the post-war period, their hopes, their disillusionments. Is that philosophy? Maybe.

Aging. That is another subject that haunts me now. We treat the old as if they were a different species. We deny them their humanity, their passions, their future. Society pushes them aside. It is a scandal. I want to write about that too. To look it in the face. Just as I looked at what it means to be a woman.

One is not born a woman, but rather becomes, a woman. That sentence has gone around the world. It means that biology is not destiny. It means that the "feminine" is a social construct. It is something we learn, something we are forced into. And if it is made, it can be unmade. It can be remade. That is the source of our freedom. And our responsibility.
