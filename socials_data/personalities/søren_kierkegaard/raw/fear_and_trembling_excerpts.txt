"Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off."

"It is quite true what philosophy says: that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other principle: that it must be lived forwards."

"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?"

"Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith."

"To stand on one leg and prove God’s existence is a very different thing from going on one’s knees and thanking Him."
