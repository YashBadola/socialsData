The Crowd is Untruth

There is a view of life which conceives that where the crowd is, there is also the truth, and that in truth itself there is need of having the crowd on its side. There is another view of life which conceives that wherever there is a crowd there is untruth, so that (to consider for a moment the extreme case), even if every individual, each for himself in private, were to be in possession of the truth, yet in case they were all to get together in a crowd - a crowd to which any sort of decisive significance is attributed, a voting, noisy, audible crowd - untruth would at once be in evidence.

For a crowd is the abstraction and the number which also becomes the rule for the concrete individual. The crowd is the untruth. Therefore was Christ crucified, because, although he addressed himself to all, he would have no dealings with the crowd, because he would not permit the crowd to aid him in any way, because in this regard he repelled people absolutely, would not found a party, did not permit balloting, but would be what he is, the Truth, which relates itself to the individual.

The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd. Let someone approach a person of this sort, let him find him in a moment when there is no opportunity for performing, when he is not in the crowd but is an individual - and then (if one is not oneself of the crowd) he will see that the leader does not regard the human being as anything at all, but only the crowd.
