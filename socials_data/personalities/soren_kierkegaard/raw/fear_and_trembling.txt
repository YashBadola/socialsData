PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be asked perhaps it is too much to ask of them; but at least they should stand polite and decent, they who have so quickly passed over the preliminary stages.

Whatever one may think of this, it is certain that faith is not the first immediacy but a subsequent immediacy. The first immediacy is the aesthetic, and here the Hegelian philosophy may be right. But faith is not the aesthetic, or else faith has never existed because it has always existed.

The story of Abraham is one such instance. The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.

Now, if the ethical is the highest, then Abraham is lost. He is a murderer. If, however, there is a teleological suspension of the ethical, then he is the knight of faith. This is the paradox which the knight of faith lives, and which I cannot understand but only admire.

I cannot make the movement of faith, I cannot shut my eyes and plunge into the absurd. But I do not claim that faith is therefore inferior; on the contrary, it is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.
