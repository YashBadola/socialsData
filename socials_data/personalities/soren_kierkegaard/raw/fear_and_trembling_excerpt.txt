Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs the trend of the market for a significant stage of the transition from period to period is well aware that the time has passed when one could ask the high price which was once the order of the day.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the Absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (one must not be ashamed of the consequences) faith has never existed but has always been a category of the aesthetic, or else Abraham is lost, or else it is necessary to interpret the story in a way which makes it unrecognizable.

Problem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its duty is to express the universal constantly, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the single individual asserts himself in his singularity before the universal, he sins, and only by acknowledging this can he be reconciled again with the universal.

But if the ethical is the highest thing, and if nothing that remains incommensurable with it can be vindicated (for the incommensurable is the evil, the jagged edges of existence which the ethical must smooth down), then one needs no other categories than the Greek ones (such as the tragic hero). But if the single individual is higher than the universal, then the ethical is reduced to a position of relativity.

The story of Abraham contains a teleological suspension of the ethical. There is no higher expression for the ethical in Abraham's life than that the father shall love the son. The ethical sense of the story is simply that Abraham was willing to murder Isaac; the religious sense is that he was willing to sacrifice him. In this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make one sleepless, and yet without this anguish Abraham is not who he is.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

By my own strength I am able to give up everything, and then I find peace and repose in pain and trust in the eternal. But by my own strength I am not able to get the least of the things that belong to finitude, for I am constantly using my strength to renounce everything. By my own strength I can give up the princess... but by my own strength I cannot get her back again, for I am employing all my strength to be resigned. But by faith, says Abraham, I did not renounce Isaac, but by faith I got Isaac.

There was one who was great by reason of his power, and one who was great by reason of his wisdom, and one who was great by reason of his hope, and one who was great by reason of his love; but Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of his love which is hatred of oneself.
