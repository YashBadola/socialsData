17. It must be confessed, however, that perception, and that which
   depends upon it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is to say,
   by figures and motions. Supposing that there were a machine whose
   structure produced thought, sensation, and perception, we could
   conceive of it as increased in size with the same proportions until one
   was able to enter into its interior, as he would into a mill. Now, on
   going into it he would find only pieces working upon one another, but
   never would he find anything to explain perception. It is accordingly
   in the simple substance, and not in the compound nor in a machine that
   the perception is to be sought. Furthermore, there is nothing besides
   perceptions and their changes to be found in the simple substance. And
   it is in these alone that all the internal activities of the simple
   substance can consist.
