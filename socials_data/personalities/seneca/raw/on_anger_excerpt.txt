We must prevent anger from coming to the fore; for if it once begins to lead the charge, it is hard to retreat. Reason is strong only so long as it stands aloof from the passions; if it mixes with them and becomes contaminated, it loses its power to restrain them. For the mind, if once it has been shaken and hurled from its seat, becomes the slave of the very impulse that drives it.

There are certain things which, in the beginning, are in our own power, but which, when they have gathered strength, drag us along with them and leave us no retreat. As a man who has thrown himself from a precipice has no control over his movements, and cannot stop or retrace his steps when he once has started, for his irrevocable descent cuts off all counsel and repentance, so the mind, if it throws itself into anger, love, or the other passions, has no power to check its own impetus; its own weight and the downward tendency of its vice must needs carry it along, and drive it to the bottom.

The best plan is to reject the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason goes for nothing when once the passion has been admitted to the mind, and has by our own free will been given a certain authority, it will for the future do as much as it chooses, not only as much as you will allow it. The enemy, I repeat, must be stopped at the very frontier; for if he has passed it, and taken the city, he will not allow his prisoners to set bounds to his victory.
