You can see from these few reflections that nothing could be more
   unjust than the objections people raise against us. Existentialism is
   nothing else but an attempt to draw the full conclusions from a
   consistently atheistic position. Its intention is not in the least that
   of plunging men into despair. And if by despair one means as the
   Christians do – any attitude of unbelief, the despair of the
   existentialists is something different. Existentialism is not atheist
   in the sense that it would exhaust itself in demonstrations of the
   non-existence of God. It declares, rather, that even if God existed
   that would make no difference from its point of view. Not that we
   believe God does exist, but we think that the real problem is not that
   of His existence; what man needs is to find himself again and to
   understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid
   proof of the existence of God. In this sense existentialism is
   optimistic. It is a doctrine of action, and it is only by
   self-deception, by confining their own despair with ours that
   Christians can describe us as without hope.
