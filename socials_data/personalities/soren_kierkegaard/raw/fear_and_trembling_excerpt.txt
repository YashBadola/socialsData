Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is pardonable to take for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further. This proceeding, on their part, they have in common with all those who at one time or another have been in the van. DESCARTES, a venerable, humble, honest thinker, whose writings surely no one can read without the deepest emotion, did what he said and said what he did. Alas, alack, that is a great rarity in our times!

The Knight of Faith

If I were to speak of him, I would say: He is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien. He takes delight in everything he sees, in the human swarm, in the new omnibuses, in the water of the Sound. He is interested in everything; he could stand and watch the builders for a day, and if someone were to speak to him, he would talk about it as if he were himself a bricklayer. He is not a poet, and I have in vain sought to detect in him the poetic incommensurability. He has not the slightest inclination to become a world-historic figure...

The Teleological Suspension of the Ethical

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further...
Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.
