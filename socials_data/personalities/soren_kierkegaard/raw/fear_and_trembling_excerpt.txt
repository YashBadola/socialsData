Preface

Not only in the commercial world but also in the world of ideas our age
is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt
cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to
make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs
attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every private
docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is
not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would
be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely
it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have
doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to go
further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all completed,
and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to
waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep
concern sought a little enlightenment in the renowned Greek philosopher,
who was the father of philosophy, not even he found it an easy matter
to know how to doubt, because that guide of his, the old Sophist,
instead of helping him, was busy all the time asserting that he knew
nothing, whereas these starters know everything.

If the custom were to assume that doubt is a task for the whole of life,
it is surely strange that this should be the only task which a human
being undertakes and finishes within the same time-span—indeed, one
might almost say, within the same breath. For as soon as he has uttered
the word "doubt," he has finished with it, or rather, he has not even
begun. But if this is not the case, if on the contrary doubt is
something that every man can undertake and finish with such ease that
it becomes a mere preliminary for everyone, then indeed we are faced
with a curious problem: how did it happen that the most honest and
profound thinkers of former times spent their whole lives in this task?

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher
than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the
movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual
who, having been in the universal, now as the single individual sets
himself apart as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then
Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because
it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the
highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any
other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be
expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than
those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from
them by consistent thought. But religion is a new category.
