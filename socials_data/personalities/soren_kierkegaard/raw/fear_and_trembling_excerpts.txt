"Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal."

"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all–what then would life be but despair?"

"The knight of faith resigns everything infinitely, and then grasps everything again by virtue of the absurd."

"To stand on one leg and prove God’s existence is a very different thing from going on one’s knees and thanking Him."
