{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern science, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but \u201cgoes further.\u201d Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all completed, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word on the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little guidance from these veterans found a single hint, a single little dietetic prescription, with respect to how one is to comport oneself in this enormous task. \u201cBut Descartes did it.\u201d Descartes, a venerable, humble, honest thinker, whose writings no one can read without being deeply affected\u2014he did what he said and said what he did. Alas, alack, that is a great rarity in our times! Descartes, as he has frequently explained, did not doubt in matters of faith. \u201cMemores tamen, ut jam dictum est, huic lumini naturali tamdiu tantum esse credendum, quamdiu nihil contrarium a Deo ipso revelatur. . . . Praeter caetera autem, memoriae nostrae pro summa regula est infigendum, ea quae nobis a Deo revelata sunt, ut omnium certissima esse credenda; et quamvis forte lumen rationis, quam maxime clarum et evidens, aliud quid nobis suggerere videretur, soli tamen auctoritati divinae potius quam proprio judicio fidem esse adhibendam.\u201d He did not cry, \u201cFire!\u201d and make it a duty for everyone to doubt, for Descartes was a quiet and solitary thinker, not a shouting street watchman; he let one know that he had doubted, but as for the rest, he said that his method had significance only for himself, and was partly based on his own earlier bungled knowledge. \u201cNe quis igitur putet me hic traditurum aliquam methodum, quam unusquisque sequi debeat ad recte regendum rationem; illam enim tantum quam ipsemet secutus sum exponere decrevi. . . . Sed simulac illud studiorum curriculum absolvi . . . totum planum mutavi consilium. . . . Quia enim pro unoquoque homine optimum est, se ipsum regere, quam celeriter illis, qui valde curiosi sunt, credere, etiamsi nonnulla valde vera dixerint.\u201d\nIn our time, as was said, one does not stop with faith but goes further. It would perhaps be rash to ask where one is going, but it is surely a sign of breeding and culture for me to assume that everyone has faith, for otherwise it would be queer to speak of going further. In those old days it was different, then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried oldster drew near to his last hour, having fought the good fight and kept the faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten that fear and trembling which chastened the youth, which the man indeed held in check, but which no man quite outgrows . . . except as he might succeed in going further as early as possible. The point where one arrives is capable of being reached by every one, the terrifying thing is only the starting point.\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal. Every time the individual after he has entered the universal asserts himself as the particular, he is in temptation (Anfechtung), and he can labor himself out of this only by abandoning himself as the particular in the universal. If this be the highest thing that can be said of man and of his existence, then the ethical has the same nature as man's eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. teleologically suspended), seeing that as soon as it is suspended it is forfeited, whereas in other cases what is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved in the higher sphere which gives it its true place.\nIf such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on \u201cThe Good and the Conscience,\u201d he characterizes man merely as the particular and regards this character as \u201ca moral form of evil\u201d which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or subjected to temptation (Anfechtung). On the other hand, he is wrong in talking of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of the faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted as a murderer.\nFor faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world . . . because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e. the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e. the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them. This is what Hegel ought to have said, and then he would not have needed to appear to include what he had not included, or needed to apply the word \u201cfaith\u201d to something which is not faith.\nThe story of Abraham contains therefore a teleological suspension of the ethical. As the individual he became higher than the universal. This is the paradox which does not permit of mediation. It is just as inexplicable how he got into it as it is inexplicable how he remained in it. If such is not the position of Abraham, then he is not even a tragic hero but a murderer. To want to continue to call him the father of faith, and then to speak of this to men who do not concern themselves with anything but words, is thoughtless. A man can become a tragic hero by his own powers\u2014but not a knight of faith. When a man enters upon the way, in a certain sense the hard way of the tragic hero, many will be able to give him counsel; to him who follows the narrow way of faith no one can give counsel, him no one can understand. Faith is a miracle, and yet no man is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nBy Anti-Climacus\nEdited by S. Kierkegaard\nIntroduction\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be a question only of one form, that of not willing to be one\u2019s own self, of willing to get rid of oneself, but there would be no question of despairingly willing to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted it. And it must be remarked that while one form of despair is the despair of not willing to be oneself, the formula for all despair is this: to relate oneself to oneself, and to will to be oneself. For to will to be oneself is man\u2019s highest and truest will, but as we have seen, this is impossible without relating oneself to the Power which constituted one.\nDespair is the Sickness unto Death\nThe concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as synonymous with a sickness unto death. In this sense despair cannot be called the sickness unto death. But in the Christian understanding of it death is itself a transition unto life. In this sense there is no sickness unto death. For Christianity death is by no means the end of all, it is but a minor event within that which is all, an eternal life; and strictly speaking there is in Christianity only one sickness unto death, and that is despair.\nBut despair is the sickness unto death in a far more specific sense. It is indeed very far from being the case that everyone who is in despair dies of it, or that despair kills a man as a physical sickness does. On the contrary, the torment of despair is precisely this, not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the moribund when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die\u2014yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one\u2019s hope, despair is the hopelessness of not being able to die.\nIt is in this last sense that despair is the sickness unto death, this agonizing contradiction, this sickness in the self, everlastingly to die, to die and yet not to die, to die the death. For dying means that it is all over, but dying the death means to live to experience death; and if for a single instant this experience is experienced as something that is all over, one experiences it precisely as an eternal beginning. If a person were to die of despair as one dies of a sickness, then the eternal in him, the self, must be capable of dying in the same sense that the body dies of sickness. But this is impossible; the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than \u201cthe dagger can slay thoughts\u201d can despair consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not quenched.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Either/Or\nA Fragment of Life\nPreface\nIt may perhaps have occurred to you, dear reader, to doubt somewhat the correctness of the familiar philosophical proposition that the outward is the inward, the inward the outward. You have perhaps kept a secret which you felt in all its joy or pain was too precious for you to be willing to initiate others into it. Your life has perhaps brought you into contact with people of whom you suspected that something of the sort was the case, without your being able, however, to wrest their secret from them by force or to take them by surprise. Perhaps neither of these cases applies to you and your life, and yet you are not a stranger to this doubt; it has merely flitted across your mind now and then like a passing shadow.\nFor my own part, I have always been somewhat skeptical about this philosophical proposition; and my skepticism has been confirmed by the little observations I have made in life. I have often been astonished to see how much that is inward can be concealed by the outward, how much that is outward can be a deception, so that the real inwardness is something quite different. I have seen men who long deceived the world, until at last the world saw through them; but I have also seen men who deceived the world in a different way, men who were better than they seemed, men who hid their inwardness under a mask of frivolity or indifference, because they were ashamed of their own feelings.\nThe papers which I here publish fell into my hands in a rather singular way. I have never been a collector of antiques, but fate has sometimes thrown strange things in my way. Seven years ago I saw in a second-hand shop in Copenhagen a secretary which I at once fell in love with. It was not a modern piece of furniture, neither was it an antique; it was what one might call a \"secretary of the old school,\" massive, simple, and yet with a certain dignity. I bought it and had it sent home.\nEvery day I opened the secretary, and every day I found new pleasure in it. But one morning, as I was opening a drawer which I had often opened before, I noticed that there was a secret compartment behind it. My heart beat violently as I pressed the spring which I had discovered. The compartment flew open, and there lay a large bundle of papers.\nI took them out and examined them. They were written in different hands, and the contents were as varied as the handwriting. Some were long essays, others were short aphorisms; some were written in a serious, almost melancholy tone, others were full of wit and irony. But what struck me most was the fact that they all seemed to revolve around one central theme: the choice between the aesthetic and the ethical life.\nThe papers were divided into two parts. The first part, which I have called \"A,\" contained a number of aesthetic essays and aphorisms. The second part, which I have called \"B,\" contained a series of letters addressed to A, in which the writer, who calls himself \"Judge William,\" argues for the ethical life.\nI have spent the last seven years editing these papers, and I now present them to the public under the title \"Either/Or.\" I have chosen this title because it seems to me to express the central theme of the work: the choice that every individual must make between living for pleasure and living for duty, between the aesthetic and the ethical.\nBut what if there is a third choice? What if the choice is not just between the aesthetic and the ethical, but between the finite and the infinite, between the temporal and the eternal? What if the true choice is the choice of faith?\nThis is the question that haunts the pages of \"Either/Or,\" even though it is never explicitly stated. It is the question that Kierkegaard would spend the rest of his life exploring.\nDiapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\nAnd men crowd about the poet and say to him, \u201cSing for us soon again\u201d\u2014which is as much as to say, \u201cMay new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\u201d And the critics come forward and say, \u201cThat is perfectly done\u2014just as it should be, according to the rules of aesthetics.\u201d Now it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. Lo, therefore I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.\nI feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.\nMy life is like an eternal night; but in this night the stars shine with a brilliance that the day knows not of.\nThe most beautiful thing in the world is to see a person who is at one with himself; but this is also the rarest thing in the world.\nTo have faith is to lose one's mind in order to win God.", "source": "either_or.txt"}
