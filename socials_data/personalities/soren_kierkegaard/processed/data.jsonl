{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. This proceeding of theirs, this preliminary motion of all of them, having doubted everything, they have in common with the French philosophers, and it was with this that the latter won immortal fame.\nBut I, Johannes de Silentio, am not a philosopher. I am a poet and an elegant thinker, a freelancer in the world of the spirit, who writes because for me it is a luxury which becomes the more pleasant and evident, the fewer there are who buy and read what I write. This preambulo is just to hint that what follows is not a system, has nothing whatever to do with the System.\nIt is an old story that the result comes out at the end, but it is one thing to have the result in writing, and quite another to have the result.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_preface.txt"}
{"text": "Introduction\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, on the contrary, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.\nIf the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the entire relation.\nSuch a derived, established relation is the human self, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair. If the human self had established itself, then there could be only one form: not to want to be oneself, to want to get rid of oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to want to be oneself.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_intro.txt"}
{"text": "Problem I: Is there such a thing as a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nIf this is the highest thing that can be said of man and his existence, then the ethical is of the same nature as man's eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. teleologically suspended), seeing that as soon as it is suspended it is forfeited, whereas in other cases what is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved in the higher thing which constitutes its telos.\nIf such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on \"The Good and the Conscience,\" he characterizes man only as the particular and regards this character as \"a moral form of evil\" which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or subjected to temptation. On the other hand, he is wrong when he talks of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted of murder.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_problem_1.txt"}
