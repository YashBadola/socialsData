Make\nyourself believe the truth of my words, - that certain moments are torn\nfrom us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our\nreach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness.\nFurthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that\nthe largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly\nshare while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that\nwhich is not to the purpose. What man can you show me who places any value\non his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he\nis dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to\ndeath+; the major portion of death has already passed, Whatever\nyears be behind us are in death's hands.\nTherefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that\nyou are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task,\nand you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are\npostponing,\n<Ep1-3>\nEPISTLE I.\nlife speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted\nby nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery\nthat anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals\nbe! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be\nreplaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them;\nbut they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some\nof that precious commodity, - time! And yet time is the one loan which\neven a grateful recipient cannot repay.\nYou may desire to know how I, who preach to\nyou so freely, am practising. I confess frankly: my expense account balances,\nas you would expect from one who is free-handed but careful. I cannot boast\nthat I waste nothing, but I can at least tell you what I am wasting, and\nthe cause and manner of the loss; I can give you the reasons why I am a\npoor man. My situation, however, is the same as that of many who are reduced\nto slender means through no fault of their own: every one forgives them,\nbut no one comes to their rescue.\nWhat is the state of things, then? It is this:\nI do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for\nhim. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot\nbegin too early.  For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to\nspare when you reach the dregs of the cask./a Of that which remains at\nthe bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.  Farewell\n<Ep1-5>\nEPISTLE II.\n~II+ ON DISCURSIVENESS IN READING\nJudging by what you write me, and by what I\nhear, I am forming a good opinion regarding your future.  You do not\nrun hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for\nsuchrestlessness+ is the sign of a\ndisordered spirit.  The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered\nmaid is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.\nBe careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every\nsort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady.  You must linger\namong a limited number of masterthinkers, and digest their works, if you\nwould derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind.  Everywhere\nmeans nowhere.  When a person spends all his time in foreign travel,\nhe ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing\nmust hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author,\nbut visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner. Food does no good and\nis not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it\nis eaten; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine;\nno wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which\nis often moved can never grow strong.  There is nothing so efficacious\nthat it can be helpful while it is being shifted about.  And in reading\nof many books is distraction.\nAccordingly, since you cannot read all the\nbooks which you may possess, it is enough to possess only as many books\nas you can read. \"But,\" you reply, \"I wish to dip first into one book and\nthen into another.\" I tell you that it is the sign of an overnice appetite\nto toy with many dishes; for when\n<Ep1-7>\nEPISTLES II., III.\nthey are manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish.  So\nyou should always read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall\nback upon those whom you read before.  Each day acquire something\nthat will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other\nmisfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select\none to be thoroughly digested that day.  This is my own custom; from\nthe many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself.\nThe thought for to-day is one which I discovered\nin Epicurus/a; for I am wont to cross over even into the enemy's camp,\n- not as a deserter, but as a scout.  He says: \"Contented poverty\nis an honourable estate.\" Indeed, if it be contented, it is not poverty\nat all. It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more,\nthat is poor.  What does it matter how much a man has laid up in his\nsafe, or in his warehouse, how large are his flocks and how fat his dividends,\nif he covets his neighbour's property, and reckons, not his past gains,\nbut his hopes of gains to come?  Do you ask what is the proper limit\nto wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have\nwhat is enough. Farewell.\n~III+ ON TRUE AND FALSE FRIENDSHIP\nYou have sent a letter to me through the hand\nof a \"friend\" of yours, as you call him.  And in your very next sentence\nyou warn me not to discuss with him all the matters that concern you, saying\nthat even you yourself are not accustomed to do this; in oother words,\nyou have in the same letter affirmed\n<Ep1-9>\nEPISTLE III.\nand denied that he is your friend.  Now if you used this word of\nours/a in the popular sense, and called him \"friend\" in the same way in\nwhich we speak of all candidates for election as \"honourable gentlemen,\"\nand as we greet all men whom we meet casually, if their names slip us for\nthe moment, with the salutation \"my dear sir,\" - so be it.  But if\nyou consider any man a friend whom you do not\ntrust+ as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do\nnot sufficiently understand what true friendship means.  Indeed, I\nwould have you discuss everything with a friend; but first of all discuss\nthe man himself.  When friendship is settled, you must trust; before\nfriendship is formed, you must pass judgment.  Those persons indeed\nput last first and confound their duties, who, violating the rules of Tbeophrastus,/b\njudge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him\ntheir friend after they have judged him.  Ponder for a long time whether\nyou shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided\nto admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul.  Speak as\nboldly with him as with yourself As to yourself, although you should live\nin such a way that you trust your own self with nothing which you could\nnot entrust even to your enemy, yet, since certain matters occur which\nconvention keeps secret, you should share with a friend at least all your\nworries and reflections. Regard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal.\nSome, for example, fearing to be deceived, have taught men to deceive;\nby their suspicions they have given their\nfriend+ the right to do wrong.  Why need I keep back any words\nin the presence of my friend?  Why should I not regard myself as alone\nwhen in his company?\n<Ep1-11>\nEPISTLES III., IV.\nThere is a class of men who communicate, to\nanyone whom they meet, matters which should be revealed to friends alone,\nand unload upon the chance listener whatever irks them.  Others, again,\nfear to confide in their closest intimates; and if it were possible, they\nwould not trust even themselves, burying their secrets deep in their hearts.\nBut we should do neither.  It is equally faulty to trust everyone\nand to trust no one.  Yet the former fault is, I should say, the more\ningenuous, the latter the more safe.  In like manner you should rebuke\nthese two kinds of men, - both those who always lack repose, and those\nwho are always in repose.  For love of bustle is not industry, - it\nis only the restlessness of a hunted mind.  And true repose does not\nconsist in condemning all motion as merely vexation; that kind of repose\nis slackness and inertia.  Therefore, you should note the following\nsaying, taken from my reading in Pomponius/a: \"Some men shrink into dark\ncorners, to such a degree that they see darkly by day.\" No, men should\ncombine these tendencies, and he who reposes should act and be who acts\nshould take repose.  Discuss the problem with Nature; she will tell\nyou that she has created both day and night.  Farewell.\n~IV+ ON THE TERRORS OF DEATH\nKeep on as you have begun, and make all possible\nhaste, so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that\nis at peace with itself.  Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during\nthe time\n<Ep1-13>\nEPISTLE IV.\nwhen you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself;\nbut quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when\none's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.  You remember,\nof course, what joy you felt when you laid aside the garments of boyhood\nand donned the man's toga, and were escorted to the forum; nevertheless,\nyou may look for a still greater joy when you have laid aside the mind\nof boyhood and when wisdom has enrolled you among men.  For it is\nnot boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, - boyishness.\nAnd this condition is all the more serious because we possess the authority\nof old age, together with the follies of boyhood, yea, even the follies\nof infancy.  Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear both.\nAll you need to do is to advance; you will\nthus understand that some things are less to be dreaded, precisely because\nthey inspire us with great fear.  No evil is great which is the last\nevil of all.  Death arrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could\nremain with you.  But death must either not come at all, or else must\ncome and pass away.\n\"It is difficult, however,\" you say, \"to bring\nthe mind to a point where it can scorn life.\" But do you not see what trifling\nreasons impel men to scorn life?  One hangs himself before the door\nof his mistress; another hurls himself from the house-top that he may no\nlonger be compelled to bear the taunts of a bad- tempered master; a third,\nto be saved from arrest after running away, drives a sword into his vitals.\nDo you not suppose that virtue will be as efficacious as excessive fear?\nNo man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it,\nor believes that living through many consulships is a great bless-\n<Ep1-15>\nEPISTLE IV.\ning.  Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to\ndepart from life contentedly; for man men clutch and cling to life, even\nas those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars\nand sharp rocks.  Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the\nfear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and\nyet they do not know how to die.  For this reason, make life as a\nwhole agreeable to yourself by banishing all worry about it.  No good\nthing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the\npossibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than\nthat which, when lost, cannot be missed.  Therefore, encourage and\ntoughen your spirit against the mishaps that afflict even the most powerful.\nFor example, the fate of Pompey was settled by a boy and a eunuch, that\nof Crassus by a cruel and insolent Parthian.\nGaius Caesar ordered Lepidus to bare his neck\nfor the axe of the tribune Dexter; and he himself offered his own throat\nto Chaerea./a No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she\ndid not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged ban.\nDo not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths.\nThe very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed.\nReflect that a highwayman or an enemy may cut your throat; and, though\nhe is not your master, every slave wields the power of life and death over\nyou.  Therefore I declare to you: he is lord of your life that scorns\nhis own.  Think of those who have perished through plots in their\nown home, slain either openly or by guile; you will that just as many have\nbeen killed by angry slaves as by angry kings.  What matter, therefore,\nhow power-\n<Ep1-17>\nEPISTLE IV.\nful he be whom you fear, when every one possesses the power which inspires\nyour fear?  But,\" you will say, \"if you should chance to fall into\nthe hands of the enemy, the conqueror will command that you be led away,\"\n- yes, whither you are already being led./a Why do you voluntarily deceive\nyourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is\nthat you have long been labouring under?  Take my word for it: since\nthe day you were born you are being led thither.  We must ponder this\nthought, and thoughts of the like nature, if we desire to be calm as we\nawait that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.\nBut I must end my letter.  Let me share\nwith you the saying which pleased me to-day.  It, too, is culled from\nanother man's Garden/b: \"Poverty+\nbrought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth.\" Do you\nknow what limits that law of nature ordains for us?  Merely to avert\nhunger, thirst, and cold.  In order to banish hunger and thirst, it\nis not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the purse-proud,\nor to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor\nis it necessary for you to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature's\nneeds are easily provided and ready to hand.  It is the superfluous\nthings for which men sweat, - the superfluous things that wear our togas\nthreadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign\nshores.  That which is enough is ready to our hands.  He who\nhas made a fair compact with poverty is rich.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-19>\nEPISTLE V.\n~V+ THE PHILOSOPHER'S MEAN\nI commend you and rejoice in the fact that you are\npersistent in your studies, and that, putting all else aside, you make\nit each day your endeavour to become a better man.  I do not merely\nexhort you to keep at it; I actually beg you to do so.  I warn you,\nhowever, not to act after the fashion of those who desire to be conspicuous\nrather than to improve, by doing things which will rouse comment as regards\nyour dress or general way of living.  Repellent attire, unkempt hair,\nslovenly beard, open scorn of silver dishes, a couch on the bare earth,\nand any other perverted forms of self-display, are to be avoided.\nThe mere name of philosophy, however quietly pursued, is an object of sufficient\nscorn; and what would happen if we should begin to separate ourselves from\nthe customs of our fellow-men?  Inwardly, we ought to be different\nin all respects, but our exterior should conform to society.  Do not\nwear too fine, nor yet too frowzy, a toga.  One needs no silver plate,\nencrusted and embossed in solid gold; but we should not believe the lack\nof silver and gold to be proof of the simple life.  Let us try to\nmaintain a higher standard of life than that of the multitude, but not\na contrary standard; otherwise, we shall frighten away and repel the very\npersons whom we are trying to improve.  We also bring it about that\nthey are unwilling to imitate us in anything, because they are afraid lest\nthey might be compelled to imitate us in everything.\nThe first thing which philosophy undertakes\nto give is fellow-feeling with all men; in other words, sympathy and sociability.\nWe part company with our promise if we are unlike other men.  We must\n<Ep1-21>\nEPISTLE V.\nsee to it that the means by which we wish to draw admiration be not\nabsurd and odious.  Our motto,/a as you know, is \"Live according to\nNature\"; but it is quite contrary to nature to torture the body, to hate\nunlaboured elegance, to be dirty on purpose, to eat food that is not only\nplain+, but disgusting and forbidding.  Just as it is a sign\nof luxury to seek out dainties, so it is madness to avoid that which is\ncustomary and can be purchased at no great price.  Philosophy calls\nfor plain+ living, but not for penance; and\nwe may perfectly well be plain and neat at the same time. This is the mean\nof which I approve; our life should observe a happy medium between the\nways of a sage and the ways of the world at large; all men should admire\nit, but they should understand it also.\nWell then, shall we act like other men?\nShall there be no distinction between ourselves and the world? \"Yes, a\nvery great one; let men find that we are unlike the common herd, if they\nlook closely. If they visit us at home, they should admire us. rather than\nour household appointments, he is a great man who uses earthenware dishes\nas if they were silver; but he is equally great who uses silver as if it\nwere earthenware. It is the sign of an unstable mind not to be able to\nendure riches+. {sprezzatura+}\nBut I wish to share with you to-day's profit\nalso.  I find in the writings of our/b Hecato that the limiting of\ndesires helps also to cure fears: \"Cease to hope,\" he says, \"and you will\ncease to fear.\" \"But how, you will reply, \"can things so different go side\nby side?\" In this way, my dear Lucilius: though they do seem at variance,\nyet they are really united.  Just as the same chain fastens the prisoner\nand the soldier who guards him, so hope and fear, dissimilar as they\n<Ep1-23>\nEPISTLES V., VI.\nare, keep step together; fear follows hope.  I am not surprised\nthat they proceed in this way; each alike belongs to a mind that is in\nsuspense, a mind that is fretted by looking forward to the future.\nBut the chief cause of both these ills is that we do not adapt ourselves\nto the present, but send our thoughts a long way ahead.  And so foresight,\nthe noblest blessing of the human race, becomes perverted.  Beasts\navoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free\nfrom care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well\nas over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring bane to us; for\nmemory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them.\nThe present alone can make no man wretched.  Farewell.\n~VI+ ON SHARING KNOWLEDGE\nI feel, my dear Lucilius, that I am being not only\nreformed, but transformed.  I do not yet, however, assure myself,\nor indulge the hope, that there are no elements left in me which need to\nbe changed. Of course there are many that should be made more compact,\nor made thinner, or be brought into greater prominence.  And indeed\nthis very fact is proof that my spirit is altered into something better,\n- that it can see its own faults, of which it was previously ignorant.\nIn certain cases sick men are congratulated because they themselves have\nperceived that they are sick.\nI therefore wish to impart to you this sudden\nchange in myself; I should th\n<Ep1-25>\nEPISTLE VI.\nwhich hope and fear and self-interest cannot sever, the friendshi|p\nin which and for the sake of which men meet death.  I can show you\nmany who have lacked, not a friend, but a friendship; this, however, cannot\npossibly happen when souls are drawn together by identical inchnations\ninto an alliance of honourable desires.  And why can it not happen?\nBecause in such cases men know that they have all things in\ncommon+, especially their troubles.\nYou cannot conceive what distinct progress\nI notice that each day brings to me.  And when you say: \"Give me also\na share in these gifts which you have found so helpful,\" I reply that I\nam anxious to heap all these privileges upon you, and that I am glad to\nlearn in order that I may teach+.  Nothing\nwill ever please me, no matter how excellent or beneficial, if I must retain\nthe knowledge of it to myself. And if wisdom were given me under the express\ncondition that it must be kept hidden and not uttered, I should refuse\nit.  No good thing is pleasant to possess, without\nfriends+ to share it.\nI shall therefore send to you the actual books;\nand in order that you may not waste time in searching here and there for\nprofitable topics, I shall mark certain passages, so that you can turn\nat once to those which I approve and admire.  Of course, however,\nthe living voice and the intimacy of a common life will help you more than\nthe written word.  You must go to the scene of action, first, because\nmen put more faith in their eyes than in their ears,/a and second, because\nthe way is long if one follows precepts, but short and helpful, if one\nfollows patterns. Cleanthes could not have been the express image of Zeno,\nif he had merely heard his lectures; he shared in his life, saw into his\n<Ep1-27>\nEPISTLES VI., VII.\nhidden purposes, and watched him to see whether he lived according to\nhis own rules.  Plato, Aristotle, and the whole throng of sages who\nwere destined to go each his different way, derived more benefit from the\ncharacter than from the words of Socrates.  It was not the class-room\nof Epicurus, but living together under the same roof, that made great men\nof Metrodorus, Hermarchus, and Polyaenus.  Therefore I summon you,\nnot merely that you may derive benefit, but that you may confer benefit;\nfor we can assist each other greatly.\nMeanwhile, I owe you my little daily contribution;\nyou shall be told what pleased me to-day in the writings of Hecato/a; it\nis these words: \"What progress, you ask, have I made?  I have begun\nto be a friend to myself.\" That was indeed a great benefit; such a person\ncan never be alone.  You may be sure that such a man is a friend to\nall mankind. Farewell.\n~VII+ ON CROWDS\nDo you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided?\nI say, crowds; for as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety.\nI shall admit my own weakness, at any rate; for I never bring back home\nthe same character that I took abroad with me.  Something of that\nwhich I have forced to be calm within me is disturbed; some of the foes\nthat I have routed return again.  Just as the sick man, who has been\nweak for a long time, is in such a condition that he cannot be taken out\nof the\n<Ep1-29>\nEPISTLE VII.\nthe house without suffering a relapse, so we ourselves are affected\nwhen our souls are recovering from a lingering discase.  To consort\nwith the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice\nattractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously therewith.\nCertainly, the greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger.\nBut nothing is so damaging to good character\nas the habit of lounging at the games; for then it is that vice steals\nsubtly upon one through the avenue of pleasure.  What do you think\nI mean? I mean that I come home more greedy, more ambitious, more voluptuous,\nand even more cruel and inhuman, because I have been among human beings.\nBy chance I attended a mid-day exhibition, expecting some fun, wit, and\nrelaxation, - an exhibition at which men's eyes have respite from the slaughter\nof their fellow-men.  But it was quite the reverse.  The previous\ncombats were the essence of compassion; but now all the trifling is put\naside and it is pure murder./a The men have no defensive armour.\nThey are exposed to blows at all points, and no one ever strikes in vain.\nMany persons prefer this programme to the usual pairs and to the bouts\n\"by request.\" Of course they do; there is no helmet or shield to deflect\nthe weapon.  What is the need of defensive armour, or of skill?\nAll these mean delaying death.  In the morning they throw men to the\nlions and the bears; at noon, they throw them to the spectators.\nThe spectators demand that the slayer shall face the man who is to slay\nhim in his turn; and they always reserve the latest conqueror for another\nbutchering.  The outcome of every fight is death, and the means are\nfire and sword.  This sort of thing goes on while the arena is empty.\nYou\n<Ep1-31>\nEPISTLE VII.\nmay retort: \"But he was a highway robber; he killed a man!\" And what\nof it?  Granted that, as a murderer, he deserved this punishment,\nwhat crime have you committed, poor fellow, that you should deserve to\nsit and see this show?  In the morning they cried \"Kill him!\nLash him!  Burn him; Why does he meet the sword in so cowardly a way?\nWhy does he strike so feebly? Why doesn't he die game?  Whip him to\nmeet his wounds!  Let them receive blow for blow, with chests bare\nand exposed to the stroke!\" And when the games stop for the intermission,\nthey announce: \"A little throatcutting in the meantime, so that there may\nstill be something going on!\"\nCome now; do you/a not understand even this\ntruth, that a bad example. reacts on the agent?  Thank the immortal\ngods that you are teaching cruelty to a person who cannot learn to be cruel.\nThe young character, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued\nfrom the mob; it is too easy to side with the majority.  Even Socrates,\nCato, and Laelius might have been shaken in their moral strength by a\ncrowd+ that was unlike them; so true it is that none of us, no matter\nhow much he cultivates his abilities, can withstand the shock of faults\nthat approach, as it were, with so great a retinue.  Much harm is\ndone by a single case of indulgence or greed; the familiar friend, if he\nbe luxurious, weakens and softens us imperecptibly; the neighbour, if he\nbe rich, rouses our covetousness; the companion, if he be slanderous, rubs\noff some of his rust upon us, even though we be spotless and sincere.\nWhat then do you think the effect will be on character, when the world\nat large assaults it!  You must either imitate or loathe the world.\n<Ep1-33>\nEPISTLE VII.\nBut both courses are to be avoided; you should not copy the bad simply\nbecause they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike\nyou.  Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can, Associate with those\nwho will make a better man of you.  Welcome those whom you yourself\ncan improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach.\nThere is no reason why pride in advertising your abilities should lure\nyou into publicity, so that you should desire to recite or harangue before\nthe general public. Of course I should be willing for you to do so if you\nhad a stock-in-trade that suited such a mob+; as it is, there is not a\nman of them who can understand you.  One or two individuals will perhaps\ncome in your way, but even these will have to be moulded and trained by\nyou so that they will understand you.  You may say: \"For what purpose\ndid I learn all these things?\" But you need not fear that you have wasted\nyour efforts; it was for yourself that you learned them.\nIn order, however, that I may not to-day have\nlearned exclusively for myself, I shall share with you three excellent\nsayings, of the same general purport, which have come to my attention.\nThis letter will give you one of them as payment of my debt; the other\ntwo you may accept as a contribution in advance.  Democritus/a says:\n\"One man means as much to me as a multitude, and a multitude only as much\nas one man.\" The following also was nobly spoken by someone or other, for\nit is doubtful who the author was; they asked him what was the object of\nall this study applied to an art that would reach but very few.  He\nreplied: \"I am content with few, content with one, content with none at\nal\n<Ep1-35>\nEPISTLES VII., VIII.\nwritten to one of the partners of his studies: \"I write this not for\nthe many, but for you; each of us is enough of an audience for the other.\"\nLay these words to heart, Lucilius, that you may scorn the pleasure which\ncomes from the applause of the majority.  Many men praise you; but\nhave you any reason for being pleased with yourself, if you are a person\nwhom the many can understand?  Your good qualities should face inwards.\nFarewell.\n~VIII+ ON THE PHILOSOPHER'S SECLUSION\n\"Do you bid me,\" you say, \"shun the throng,\nand withdraw from men, and be content with my own conscience?  Where\nare the counsels of your school, which order a man to die in the midst\nof active work?\" As to the course/a which I seem to you to be urging on\nyou now and then, my object in shutting myself up and locking the door\nis to be able to help a greater number.  I never spend a day in idleness;\nI appropriate even a part of the night for study.  I do not allow\ntime for sleep but yield to it when I must, and when my eyes are wearied\nwith waking and ready to fall shut, I keep them at their task.  I\nhave withdrawn not only from men, but from affairs, especially from my\nown affairs; I am working for later generations, writing down some ideas\nthat may be of assistance to them. There are certain wholesome counsels,\nwhich may be compared to prescriptions of useful drugs; these I am putting\ninto writing; for I have found them helpful in ministering to my own sores,\nwhich, if not wholly cured, have at any rate ceased to spread.\n<Ep1-37>\nEPISTLE, VIII.\nI point other men to the right path, which\nI have found late in life, when wearied with wandering.  I cry out\nto them: \"Avoid whatever pleases the throng: avoid the gifts of Chance!\nHalt before every good which Chance brings to you, in a spirit of doubt\nand fear; for it is the dumb animals and fish that are deceived by tempting\nhopes+.  Do you call these things the 'gifts' of\nFortune+?  They are snares.  And any man among you who\nwishes to live a life of safety will avoid, to the utmost of his power,\nthese limed twigs of her favour, by which we mortals, most wretched in\nthis respect also, are deceived; for we think that we hold them in our\ngrasp, but they hold us in theirs.  Such a career leads us into precipitous\nways, and life on such heights ends in a fall.  Moreover, we cannot\neven stand up against prosperity when she begins to drive us to leeward;\nnor can we go down, either, 'with the ship at least on her course,' or\nonce for all,/a; Fortune does not capsize us, - she plunges our bows under/b\nand dashes us on the rocks.\nHold fast, then, to this sound and wholesome\nrule of life - that you indulge the body only so far as is needful for\ngood health.  The body should be treated more rigorously, that it\nmay not be disobedient to the mind.  Eat merely to relieve your hunger;\ndrink merely to quench your thirst; dress merely to keep out the cold;\nhouse yourself merely as a protection against personal discomfort.\nIt matters little whether the house be built of turf, or of variously coloured\nimported marble; understand that a man is sheltered just as well by a thatch\nas by a roof of gold. Despise everything that useless toil creates as an\nornament and an object of beauty.  And reflect that nothing except\nthe soul is worthy\n<Ep1-39>\nEPISTLE VIII.\nof wonder; for to the soul, \"if it be great, naught is great.\"/a\nWhen I commune in such terms with myself and\nwith future generations, do you not think that I am doing more good than\nwhen I appear as counsel in court, or stamp my seal upon a will, or lend\nmy assistance in the senate, by word or action, to a candidate?  Believe\nme, those who seem to be busied with nothing are busied with the greater\ntasks; they are dealing at the same time with things mortal and things\nimmortal.\nBut I must stop, and pay my customary contribution,\nto\nbalance this letter.  The payment shall not be made from my own property;\nfor I am still conning Epicurus./b I read to-day, in his works, the following\nsentence: \"If you would enjoy real\nfreedom+, you must be the slave+ of\nPhilosophy.\" The man who submits and surrenders himself to her is not kept\nwaiting; he is emancipated/c on the spot.  For the very service of\nPhilosophy is freedom.  It is likely that you will ask me why I quote\nso many of Epicurus's noble words instead of words taken from our own school.\nBut is there any reason why you should regard them as sayings of Epicurus\nand not common property?  How many poets give forth ideas that have\nbeen uttered, or may be uttered, by philosophers!  I need not touch\nupon the tragedians and our writers of national drama/d; for these last\nare also somewhat serious, and stand half-way between comedy and tragedy.\nWhat a quantity of sagacious verses lie buried in the mime!  How many\nof Publilius's lines are worthy of being spoken by buskin-clad actors,\nas well as by wearers of the slipper/e! I shall quote one verse of his,\nwhich concerns philosophy, and particularly that phase\n<Ep1-41>\nEPISTLES VIII., IX.\nof it which we were discussing a moment ago, wherein he says that the\ngifts of Chance+ are not to be regarded as\npart of our possessions:\nStill alien is whatever you have gained\nBy coveting./a\nI recall that you yourself expressed this idea\nmuch more happily and concisely:\nWhat Chance has made yors is not really yours./b\nAnd a third, spoken by you still more happily,\nshall not be omitted:\nThe good that could be given, can be removed./c\nI shall not charge this up to the expense account,\nbecause I have given it to you from your own stock.  Farewell.\n~IX+ ON PHILOSOPHY AND FRIENDSHIP\nYou desire to know whether Epicurus is right\nwhen, in one of his letters,/d he rebukes those who hold that the wise\nman is self-sufficient and for that reason does not stand in need of friendships.\nThis is the objection raised by Epicurus against Stilbo and those who believe/e\nthat the Supreme Good is a soul which is insensible to feeling.\nWe are bound to meet with a double meaning\nif we try to express the Greek term \"lack of feeling\" summarily, in a single\nword, rendering it by the Latin word impanentia.  For it may be understood\nin the meaning the opposite to that which we wish it to have.  What\nwe mean to express is, a soul which rejects any sensation of evil; but\npeople will interpret the idea\n<Ep1-43>\nEPISTLE IX.\nas that of a soul which can endure no evil.  Consider, therefore,\nwhether it is not better to say \"a soul that cannot be harmed,\" or \" a\nsoul entirety beyond the realm of suffering.\" There is this difference\nbetween ourselves and the other school/a: our ideal wise man feels his\ntroubles, but overcomes them; their wise man does not even feel them.\nBut we and they alike hold this idea, - that the wise man is self-sufficient.\nNevertheless, he desires friends, neighbours, and associates, no matter\nhow much he is sufficient unto himself.  And mark how self-sufficient\nbe is; for on occasion he can be content with a part of himself.\nIf he lose a hand through disease or war, or if some accident puts out\none or both of his eyes, he will be satisfied with what is left, taking\nas much pleasure in his impaired and maimed body as he took when it was\nsound.  But while he does not pine for these parts if they are missing,\nhe prefers not to lose them.  In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient,\nthat he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them.\nWhen I say \"can,\" I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.\nBut he need never lack friends, for it lies\nin his own control how soon he shall make good a loss.  Just as Phidias,\nif he lose a statue, can straightway carve another, even so our master\nin the art of making friendships can fill the place of a friend he has\nlost.  If you ask how one can make oneself a friend quickly, I will\ntell you, provided we are agreed that I may pay my debt/b at once and square\nthe account, so far as this letter is concerned.  Hecato/c, says:\n\"I can show you a philtre, compounded without drugs, herbs, or any witch's\nincantation: 'If you would be loved,\nlove+.'\" Now there is great\n<Ep1-45>\nEPISTLE IX.\npleasure, not only in maintaining old and established friendships, but\nalso in beginning and acquiring new ones.  There is the same difference\nbetween winning a new friend and having already won him, as there is between\nthe farmer who sows and the farmer who reaps.  The philosopber Attalus\nused to say:  It is more pleasant to make than to keep a friend, as\nit is more pleasant to the artist to paint than to have finished painting.\"\nWhen one is busy and absorbed in one's work, the very absorption affords\ngreat delight; but when one has withdrawn one's hand from the completed\nmasterpiece, the pleasure is not so keen.  Henceforth it is the fruits\nof his art that he enjoys; it was the art itself that he enjoyed while\nhe was painting.  In the case of our children, their young manhood\nyields the more abundant fruits, but their infancy was sweeter.\nLet us now return to the question.  The\nwise man, I say, self-sufficient though he be, nevertheless desires friends\nif only for the purpose of practising\nfriendship+, in order that his noble qualities may not lie dormant.\nNot, however, for the purpose mentioned by Epicurus/a in the letter quoted\nabove: \"That there may be someone to sit by him when he is ill, to help\nhim when he is in prison or in want;\" but that he may have someone by whose\nsick-bed he himself may sit, someone a prisoner in hostile hands whom he\nhimself may set free.  He who regards himself only, and enters upon\nfriendships for this reason, reckons wrongly. The end will be like the\nbeginning: he has made friends with one who might assist him out of bondage;\nat the first rattle of the chain such a friend will desert him.  These\nare the so-called \"fair_weather+\"\nfriendships; one who is chosen for the sake of utility will be satisfactory\nonly so long as\n<Ep1-47>\nEPISTLE IX.\nhe is useful.  Hence prosperous men are blockaded by troops of\nfriends; but those who have failed stand amid vast loneliness their friends\nfleeing from the very crisis which is to test their worth. {Timon+}\nHence, also, we notice those many shameful cases of persons who, through\nfear, desert or betray.  The beginning and the end cannot but harmonize.\nHe who begins to be your friend because it pays will also cease because\nit pays.  A man will be attracted by some reward offered in exchange\nfor his friendship, if he be attracted by aught in friendship other than\nfriendship itself.\nFor what purpose, then, do I make a man my\nfriend?  In order to have someone for whom I may die, whom I may follow\ninto exile, against whose death I may stake my own life, and pay the pledge,\ntoo.  The friendship which you portray is a bargain and not a friendship;\nit regards convenience only, and looks to the results.  Beyond question\nthe feeling of a lover has in it something akin to friendship; one might\ncall it friendship run mad.  But, though this is true, does anyone\nlove for the sake of gain, or promotion, or renown?  Pure/a\nlove+, careless of all other things, kindles the soul with desire\nfor the beautiful object, not without the hope of a return of the affection.\nWhat then?  Can a cause which is more honourable produce a passion\nthat is base?  You may retort: \"We are now discussing the question\nwhether friendship is to be cultivated for its own sake.\" On the contrary,\nnothing more urgently requires demonstration; for if friendship is to be\nsought for its own sake, he may seek it who is self-sufficient. \"How, then,\"\nyou ask, \"does he seek it?\" Precisely as he seeks an object of great beauty,\nnot attracted to it by desire for gain, nor\n<Ep1-49>\nEPISTLE IX.\nyet frightened by the instability of Fortune.  One who seeks friendship\nfor favourable occasions, strips it of all its nobility.\n\"The wise man is self-sufficient.\" This phrase,\nmy dear Lucilius, is incorrectly explained by many; for they withdraw the\nwise man from the world, and force him to dwell within his own skin.\nBut we must mark with care what this sentence signifies and how far it\napplies; the wise man is sufficient unto himself for a happy existence,\nbut not for mere existence.  For he needs many helps towards mere\nexistence; but for a happy existence he needs only a sound and upright\nsoul, one that despises Fortune.\nI should like also to state to you one of\nthe distinctions ofChrysippus,/a who declares that the wise man is in want\nof nothing, and yet needs many things./a \"On the other hand,\" he says,\n\"nothing is needed by the fool, for he does not understand how to use anything,\nbut he is in want of everything.\" The wise man needs hands, eyes, and many\nthings that are necessary for his daily use; but he is in want of nothing.\nFor want implies a necessity, and nothing is necessary to the wise man.\nTherefore, although he is self-sufficient, yet he has need of friends.\nHe craves as many friends as possible, not, however, that he may live happily;\nfor he will live happily even without friends.  The Supreme Good calls\nfor no practical aids from outside; it is developed at home, and arises\nentirely within itself.  If the good seeks any portion of itself from\nwithout, it begins to be subject to the play of Fortune.\nPeople may say: \"But what sort of existence\nwill the wise man have, if he be left friendless when thrown into prison,\nor when stranded in some foreign nation, or when delayed on a long voyage,\nor when\n<Ep1-51>\nEPISTLE IX.\nout upon a lonely shore?\" His life will be like that of Jupiter, who,\namid the dissolution of the world, when the gods are confounded together\nand Nature rests for a space from her work, can retire into himself and\ngive himself over to his own thoughts./a In some such way as this the sage\nwill act; he will retreat into himself, and live with himself.  As\nlong as he is allowed to order his affairs according to his judgment, he\nis self-sufficient - and marries a wife; he is self-sufficient - and brings\nup children; he is self-sufficient - and yet could not live if he had to\nlive without the society of man.  Natural promptings, and not his\nown selfish needs, draw him into Friendships.  For just as other things\nhave for us an inherent attractiveness, so has friendship.  As we\nhate solitude and crave society, as nature draws men to each other, so\nin this matter also there is an attraction which makes us desirous of friendship.\nNevertheless, though the sage may love his friends dearly, often comparing\nthem with himself, and putting them ahead of himself, yet all the good\nwill be limited to his own being, and he will speak the words which were\nspoken by the very Stilbo/b whom Epicurus criticizes in his letter.\nFor Stilbo, after his country was captured and his children and his wife\nlost, as he emerged from the general desolation alone and yet happy, spoke\nas follows to Demetrius, called Sacker of Cities because of the destruction\nhe brought upon them, in answer to the question whether he had lost anything:\n\"I have all my goods with me!\" There is a brave and stout-hearted man for\nyou!  The enemy conquered, but Stilbo conquered his conqueror. \"I\nhave lost nothing!\" Aye, he forced Demetrius to wonder whether he himself\nhad conquered after all. \"My goods are\n<Ep1-53>\nEPISTLE IX.\nall with me! \" In other words, he deemed nothing that might be taken\nfrom him to be a good.\nWe marvel at certain aniinals because they\ncan pass through fire and suffer no bodily harm; but how much more marvellous\nis a man who has marched forth unhurt and unscathed through fire and sword\nand devastation!  Do you understand now how much easier it is to conquer\na whole tribe than to conquer one man?  This saying of Stilbo makes\ncommon ground with Stoicism; the Stoic also can carry his goods unimpaired\nthrough cities that have been burned to ashes; for he is self-sufficient.\nSuch are the bounds which he sets to his own happiness.\nBut you must not think that our school alone can\nutter noble words; Epicurus himself, the reviler of Stilbo, spoke similar\nlanguage/a; put it down to my credit, though I have already wiped out my\ndebt for the present day./b He says: \"Whoever does not regard what he has\nas most ample wealth, is unhappy, though he be master of the whole world.\"\nOr, if the following seems to you a more suitable phrase, - for we must\ntry to render the meaning and not the mere words: \"A man may rule the world\nand still be unhappy, if he does not feel that he is supremely happy.\"\nIn order, however, that you may know that these sentiments are universal,/c\nsuggested, of course, by Nature, you will find in one of the comic poets\nthis verse;\nUnblest is he who thinks himself unblest./d\nor what does your condition matter, if it is bad in your own eyes?\nYou may say; \"What then?  If yonder man, rich by base means, and yonder\nman, lord of many but slave of more, shall call themselves happy, will\ntheir own opinion make them happy?\"\n<Ep1-55>\nEPISTLES IX., X.\nIt matters not what one says, but what one feels; also, not how one\nfeels on one particular day, but how one feels at all times.  There\nis no reason, however, why you should fear that this great privilege will\nfall into unworthy hands; only the wise man is pleased with his own.\nFolly is ever troubled with weariness of itself.  Farewell.\n~X+ ON LIVING TO ONESELF\nYes, I do not change my opinion: avoid the many, avoid\nthe few, avoid even the individual.  I know of no one with whom I\nshould be willing to have you shared.  And see what an opinion of\nyou I have; for I dare to trust you with your own self.  Crates, they\nsay, the disciple of the very Stilbo whom I mentioned in a former letter,\nnoticed a young man walking by himself, and asked him what he was doing\nall alone. \"I am communing with myself,\" replied the youth. \"Pray be careful,\nthen,\" said Crates, \"and take good heed; you are communing with a bad man!\"\nWhen persons are in mourning, or fearful about\nsomething, we are accustomed to watch them that we may prevent them from\nmaking a wrong use of their loneliness.  No thoughtless person ought\nto be left alone; in such cases he only plans folly, and heaps up future\ndangers for himself or for others; he brings into play his base desires;\nthe mind displays what fear or shame used to repress; it whets his boldness,\nstirs his passions, and goads his anger.  And finally, the only benefit\nthat solitude confers, - the habit of trusting no man, and of fearing no\nwitnesses, - is lost to the fool; for he betrays himself.\nMark therefore what my hopes are for you,\n- nay,\n<Ep1-57>\nEPISTLE X.\nrather, what I am promising myself, inasmuch as hope is merely the title\nof an uncertain blessing:  I do not know any person with whom I should\nprefer you to associate rather than yourself.  I remember in what\na great-souled way you hurled forth certain phrases, and how full of strength\nthey were! I immediately congratulated myself and said: \"These words did\nnot come from the edge of the lips; these utterances have a solid foundation.\nThis man is not one of the many; he has regard for his real welfare.\" Speak,\nand live, in this way; see to it that nothing keeps you down.  As\nfor your former prayers, you may dispense the gods from answering them;\noffer new prayers; pray for a sound mind and for good health, first of\nsoul and then of body.  And of course you should ofter those prayers\nfrequently.  Call boldly upon God; you will not be asking him for\nthat which belongs to another.\nBut I must, as is my custom, send a little\ngift along with this letter.  It is a true saying which I have found\nin Athenodorus/a: \"Know that thou art freed from all desires when thou\nhast reached such a point that thou prayest to God for nothing except what\nthou canst pray for openly.\" But how foolish men are now!  They whisper\nthe basest of prayers to heaven; but if anyone listens, they are silent\nat once.  That which they are unwilling for men to know, they communicate\nto God.  Do you not think, then, that some such wholesome advice as\nthis could be given you: \"Live amon\n<Ep1-59>\nEPISTLE XI.\n~XI+ ON THE BLUSH OF MODESTY\nYour friend and I have had a conversation.\nHe is a man of ability; his very first words showed what spirit and understanding\nbe possesses, and what progress he has already made.  He gave me a\nforetaste, and he will not fail to answer thereto.  For he spoke not\nfrom forethought, but was suddenly caught off his guard.  When he\ntried to collect himself, he could scarcely banish that hue of modesty,\nwhich is a good sign in a young man; the blush that spread over his face\nseemed so to rise from the depths.  And I feel sure that his habit\nof blushing will stay with him after he has strengthened his character,\nstripped off all his faults, and become wise.  For by no wisdom can\nnatural weaknesses of the body be removed.  That which is implanted\nand inborn can be toned down by training, but not overcome. The steadiest\nspeaker, when before the public, often breaks into a perspiration, as if\nbe had wearied or over-heated himself; some tremble in the knees when they\nrise to speak; I know of some whose teeth chatter, whose tongues falter,\nwhose lips quiver.  Training and experience can never shake off this\nhabit; nature exerts her own power and through such a weakness makes her\npresence known even to the strongest.  I know that the blush, too,\nis a habit of this sort, spreading suddenly over the faces of the most\ndignified men.  It is, indeed more prevalent in youth, because of\nthe warmer blood and the sensitive countenance; nevertheless, both seasoned\nmen and aged men are affected by it.  Some are most dangerous when\nthey redden, as if they were letting all their sense of shame escape.\nSulla, when\n<Ep1-61>\nEPISTLE XI.\nthe blood mantled his cheeks, was in his fiercest mood.  Pompey\nhad the most sensitive cast of countenance; he always blushed in the presence\nof a gathering, and especially at a public assembly.  Fabianus also,\nI remember, reddened when be appeared as a witness before the senate; and\nhis embarrassment became him to a remarkable degree.  Such a habit\nis not due to mental weakness, but to the novelty of a situation; an inexperienced\nperson is not necessarily confused, but is usually affected, because he\nslips into this habit by natural tendency of the body.  Just as certain\nmen are full-blooded, so others are of a quick and mobile blood, that rushes\nto the face at once. As I remarked, Wisdom can never remove this ha|bit;\nfor if she could rub out all our faults, she would be mistress of the universe.\nWhatever is assigned to us by the terms of our birth and the blend in our\nconstitutions, will stick with us, no matter how hard or how long the soul\nmay have tried to master itself.  And we cannot forbid these\nfeelings+ any more than we can summon them.\nActors+ in the theatre, who imitate the emotions, who portray fear\nand nervousness, who depict sorrow, imitate bashfulness by hanging their\nheads, lowering their voices, and keeping their eyes fixed and rooted upon\nthe ground.  They cannot, however, muster a blush; for the blush cannot\nbe prevented or acquired.  Wisdom will not assure us of a remedy,\nor give us help against it; it comes or goes unbidden, and is a law unto\nitself.\nBut my letter calls for its closing sentence.\nHear and take to heart this useful and wholesome motto/a: \"Cherish some\nman of high character, and keep him ever before your eyes, living as if\nhe were watching\n<Ep1-63>\nEPISTLES XI., XII.\nyou, and ordering all your actions as if he beheld them.\" Such, my dear\nLucilius, is the counsel of Epicurus/a; he has quite properly given us\na guardian and an attendant.  We can get rid of most sins, if we have\na witness who stands near us when we are likely to go wrong.  The\nsoul should have someone whom it can respect, - one by whose authority\nit may make even its inner shrine more hallowed./b Happy is the man who\ncan make others better, not merely when he is in their company, but even\nwhen he is in their thoughts!  And happy also is he who can so revere\na man as to calm and regulate himself by calling him to mind!  One\nwho can so revere another, will soon be himself worthy of reverence.\nChoose therefore a Cato; or, if Cato seems too severe a model, choose some\nLaelius, a gentler spirit. Choose a master whose life, conversation, and\nsoul-expressing face have satisfied you; picture him always to yourself\nas your protector or your pattern.  For we must indeed have someone\naccording to whom we may regulate our characters; you can never straighten\nthat which is crooked unless you use a ruler.  Farewell.\n~XII+ ON OLD AGE\nWherever I turn, I see evidences of my advancing years.\nI visited lately my country-plice, and protested against the money which\nwas spent on the tumble-down building.  My bailiff maintained that\nthe flaws were not due to his own carelessness; \"he was doing everything\npossible, but the house was old.\" And this was the house which grew under\nmy own hands! What has the future in store for\n<Ep1-65>\nEPISTLE XII.\nme, if stones of my own age are already crumbling?  I was angry,\nand I embraced the first opportunity to vent my spleen in the bailiff's\npresence. \"It is clear,\" I cried, \"that these plane-trees are neglected;\nthey have no leaves.  Their branches are so gnarled and shrivelled;\nthe boles are so rough and unkempt!  This would not happen, if someone\nloosened the earth at their feet, and watered them.\" The bailiff swore\nby my protecting deity that \"he was doing everything possible, and never\nrelaxed his efforts, but those trees were old.\" Between you and me, I had\nplanted those trees myself, I had seen them in their first leaf.\nThen I turned to the door and asked: \"Who is that broken-down dotard?\nYou have done well to place him at the entrance; for he is outward bound./a\nWhere did you get him? What pleasure did it give you to take up for burial\nsome other man's dead?/b But the slave said: \"Don't you know me, sir?\nI am Felicio; you used to bring me little images./c My father was Philositus\nthe steward, and I am your pet slave.\" \"The man is clean crazy,\" I remarked.\n\"Has my pet slave become a little boy again?  But it is quite possible;\nhis teeth are just dropping out.\"/d\nI owe it to my country-place that my old age\nbecame apparent whithersoever I turned.  Let us cherish and love old\nage; for it is full of pleasure if one knows how to use it.  Fruits\nare most welcome when almost over; youth is most charming at its close;\nthe last drink delights the toper, the glass which souses him and puts\nthe finishing touch on his drunkenness.  Each pleasure reserves to\nthe end the greatest delights which it contains.  Life is most delightful\nwhen it is on the downward slope, but has not yet reached the abrupt decline.\nAnd I myself believe that the period which stands, so to\n<Ep1-67>\nEPISTLE XII.\nspeak, on the edge of the roof, possesses pleasures of its own.\nOr else the very fact of our not wanting pleasures has taken the place\nof the pleasures themselves.  How comforting it is to have tired out\none's appetites, and to have done with them! \"But,\" you say, \"it is a nuisance\nto be looking death in the face!\" Death, however, should be looked in the\nface by young and old alike.  We are not summoned according to our\nrating on the censor's list./a Moreover, no one is so old that it would\nbe improper for him to hope for another day of existence.  And one\nday, mind you, is a stage on life's journey.\nOur span of life is divided into parts; it\nconsists of large circles enclosing smaller.  One circle embraces\nand bounds the rest; it reaches from birth to the last day of existence.\nThe next circle limits the period of our young manhood.  The third\nconfines all of childhood in its circumference.  Again, there is,\nin a class by itself, the year; it contains within itself all the divisions\nof time by the multiplication of which we get the total of life.\nThe month is bounded by a narrower ring. The smallest circle of all is\nthe day; but even a day has its beginning and its ending, its sunrise and\nits sunset.  Hence Heraclitus, whose obscure style gave him his surname,/b\nremarked: \"One day is equal to every. day:\" Different persons have interpreted\nthe saying in different ways.  Some hold that days are equal in number\nof hours, and this is true; for if by \"day\" we mean twenty-four hours'\ntime, all days must be equal, inasmuch as the night acquires what the day\nloses.  But others maintain that one day is equal to all days through\nresemblance, because the very longest space of time possesses no element\nwhich cannot be found in a single day, - namely, light and\n<Ep1-69>\nEPISTLE XII.\ndarkness, - and even to eternity day makes these alternations/a more\nnumerous, not different when it is shorter and different again when it\nis longer.  Hence, every day ought to be regulated as if it closed\nthe series, as if it rounded out and completed our existence.\nPaeuvius, who by long occupancy made Syria\nhis own,/b used to hold a regular burial sacrifice in his own honour, with\nwine and the usual funeral feasting, and then would have himself carried\nfrom the dining-room to his chamber, while eunuchs applauded and sang in\nGreek to a musical accompaniment: \"He has lived his life, he has lived\nhis life!\" Thus Paeuvius had himself carried out to burial every day.\nLet us, however, do from a good motive what he used to do from a debased\nmotive; let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say:\nI have\nlived; the course which Fortune set for me Is finished./c\nAnd if God is pleased to add another day,\nwe should welcome it with glad hearts.  That man is happiest, and\nis secure in his own possession of himself, who can await the morrow without\napprehension. When a man has said: \"I have lived!\", every morning he arises\nhe receives a bonus.\nBut now I ought to close my letter. \"What?\"\nyou say; \"shall it come to me without any little offering? \"Be not afraid;\nit brings something, - nay, more than something, a great deal.  For\nwhat is more noble than the following saying/d of which I make this letter\nthe bearer: \"It is wrong to live under constraint; but no man is constrained\nto live under constraint.\" Of course not.  On all sides lie\n<Ep1-71>\nEPISTLES XII., XIII.\nmany short and simple paths to\nfreedom+; and let us thank God that no man can be kept in life.\nWe may spurn the very constraints that hold us. \"Epicurus,\" you reply,\n\"uttered these words; what are you doing with another'sproperty+?\n\"Any truth, I maintain, is my own property.  And I shall continue\nto heap quotations from Epicurus upon you, so that all persons who swear\nby the words of another, and put a value upon the speaker and not upon\nthe thing spoken, may understand that the best ideas are common property.\nFarewell.\n~XIII+ ON GROUNDLESS FEARS\nI know that you have plenty of spirit; for even before\nyou began to equip yourself with maxims which were wholesome and potent\nto overcome obstacles, you were taking pride in your contest with Fortune;\nand this is all the more true, now that you have grappled with Fortune\nand tested your powers.  For our powers can never inspire in us implicit\nfaith in ourselves except when many difficulties have confronted us on\nthis side and on that, and have occasionally even come to close quarters\nwith us.  It is only in this way that the true spirit can be tested,\n- the spirit that will never consent to come under the jurisdiction of\nthings external to ourselves.  This is the touchstone of such a spirit;\nno prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never\nbeen beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter\nthe lists is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth\nrattle beneath his opponent's fist, who has\n<Ep1-73>\nEPISTLE XIII.\nbeen tripped and felt the full force of his adversary's charge, who\nhas been downed in body but not in spirit, one who, as often as he falls,\nrises again with greater defiance than ever.  So then, to keep up\nmy figure, Fortune has often in the past got the upper hand of you, and\nyet you have not surrendered, but have leaped up and stood your ground\nstill more eagerly. For manliness gains much strength by being challenged;\nnevertheless, if you approve, allow me to offer some additional safeguards\nby which you may fortify yourself.  There are more things, Lucilius,\nlikely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often\nin imagination than in reality.  I am not speaking with you in the\nStoic strain but in my milder style.  For it is our Stoic fashion\nto speak of all those things, which provoke cries and groans, as unimportant\nand beneath notice; but you and I must drop such greatsounding words, although,\nheaven knows, they are true enough.  What I advise you to do is, not\nto be unhappy before the crisis comes; since it may be that the dangers\nbefore which you paled as if they were threatening you, will never come\nupon you; they certainly have not yet come.  Accordingly, some things\ntorment us more than they ought; some torment us before they ought; and\nsome torment us when they ought not to torment us at all.  We are\nin the habit of exaggerating, or imagining, or anticipating, sorrow.\nThe first of these three faults/a may be postponed\nfor the present, because the subject is under discussion and the case is\nstill in court, so to speak.  That which I should call trifling, you\nwill maintain to be most serious; for of course I know that some men laugh\nwhile being flogged, and that others wince at\n<Ep1-75>\nEPISTLE XIII.\na box on the ear.  We shall consider later whether these evils\nderive their power from their own strength, or from our own weakness.\nDo me the favour, when men surround you and\ntry to talk you into believing that you are unhappy, to consider not what\nyou hear but what you yourself feel, and to take counsel with your feelings\nand question yourself independently, because you know your own affairs\nbetter than anyone else does.  Ask: \"Is there any reason why these\npersons should condole with me?  Why should they be worried or even\nfear some infection from me, as if troubles could be transmitted?\nIs there any evil involved, or is it a matter merely of ill report, rather\nthan an evil?\" Put the question voluntarily to yourself: \"Am I tormented\nwithout sufficient reason, am I morose, and do I convert what is not an\nevil into what is an evil?\" You may retort with the question: \"How am I\nto know whether my sufferings are real or imaginary?\" Here is the rule\nfor such matters: we are tormented either by things present, or by things\nto come, or by both.  As to things present, the decision is easy.\nSuppose that your person enjoys freedom and health, and that you do not\nsuffer from any external injury.  As to what may happen to it in the\nfuture, we shall see later on.  To-day there is nothing wrong with\nit. \"But,\" you say, \"something will happen to it.\" First of all, consider\nwhether your proofs of future trouble are sure. For it is more often the\ncase that we are troubled by our apprehensions, and that we are mocked\nby that mocker, rumour, which is wont to settle wars, but much more often\nsettles individuals.  Yes, my dear Lucilius; we agree too quickly\nwith what people say.  We do not put to the test those\n<Ep1-77>\nEPISTLE XIII.\nthings which cause our fear; we do not examine into them; we blench\nand retreat just like soldiers who are forced to abandon their camp because\nof a dust-cloud raised by stampeding cattle, or are thrown into a panic\nby the spreading of some unauthenticated rumour.  And somehow or other\nit is the idle report that disturbs us most.  For truth has its own\ndeflnite boundaries, but that which arises from uncertainty is delivered\nover to guesswork and the irresponsible license of a frightened mind.\nThat is why no fear is so ruinous and so uncontrollable as panic fear.\nFor other fears are groundless, but this fear is witless.\nLet us, then, look carefully into the matter.\nIt is likely that some troubles will befall us; but it is not a present\nfact.  How often has the unexpected happened!  How often has\nthe expected never come to pass!  And even though it is ordained to\nbe, what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering?  You will\nsuffer soon enough, when it arrives; so look forward meanwhile to better\nthings.  What shall you gain by doing this?  Time.  There\nwill be many happenings meanwhile which will serve to postpone, or end,\nor pass on to another person, the trials which are near or even in your\nvery presence.  A fire has opened the way to flight.  Men have\nbeen let down softly by a catastrophe.  Sometimes the sword has been\nchecked even at the victim's throat.  Men have survived their own\nexecutioners.  Even bad\nfortune+ is fickle.  Perhaps it will come, perhaps not; in\nthe meantime it is not.  So look forward to better things.\nThe mind at times fashions for itself false\nshapes of evil when there are no signs that point to any evil; it twists\ninto the worst construction some word\n<Ep1-79>\nEPISTLE XIII.\nof doubtful meaning; or it fancies some personal grudge to be more serious\nthan it really is, considering not how angry the enemy is, but to what\nlengths he may go if he is angry.  But life is not worth living, and\nthere is no limit to our sorrows, if we indulge our fears to the greatest\npossible extent; in this matter, let prudence help you, and contemn with\na resolute spirit even when it is in plain sight.  If you cannot do\nthis, counter one weakness with another, and temper your\nfear+ with hope.  There is nothing so certain among these objects\nof fear that it is not more certain still that things we dread sink into\nnothing and that things we hope for mock us.\nAccordingly, weigh carefully your hopes as\nwell as your fears, and whenever all the elements are in doubt, decide\nin your own favour; believe what you prefer.  And if fear wins a majority\nof the votes, incline in the other direction anyhow, and cease to harass\nyour soul, reflecting continually that most mortals, even when no troubles\nare actually at hand or are certainly to be expected in the future, become\nexcited and disquieted.  No one calls a halt on himself, when he begins\nto be urged ahead; nor does he regulate his alarm according to the truth.\nNo one says; \"The author of the story is a fool, and he who has believed\nit is a fool, as well as he who fabricated it.\" We let ourselves drift\nwith every breeze; we are frightened at uncertainties, just as if they\nwere certain.  We observe no moderation.  The slightest thing\nturns the scales and throws us forthwith into a panic.\nBut I am ashamed either to admonish you sternly\nor to try to beguile you with such mild remedies.  Let another say.\n\"Perhaps the worst will not\n<Ep1-81>\nEPISTLE XIII.\nhappen.\" You yourself must say. \"Well, what if it does happen?\nLet us see who wins!  Perhaps it happens for my best interests; it\nmay be that such a death will shed credit upon my life.\" Socrates was ennobled\nby the hemlock draught.  Wrench from Cato's hand his sword, the vindicator\nof liberty, and you deprive him of the greatest share of his glory.\nI am exhorting you far too long, since you need reminding rather than exhortation.\nThe path on which I am leading you is not different from that on which\nyournature+ leads you; you were born to such\nconduct as I describe.  Hence there is all the more reason why you\nshould increase and beautify the good that is in you.\nBut now, to close my letter, I have only to\nstamp the usual seal upon it, in other words, to commit thereto some noble\nmessage to be delivered to you: \"The fool, with all his other faults, has\nthis also, he is always getting ready to live./a Reflect, my esteemed Lucilius,\nwhat this saying means, and you will see how revolting is the fickleness\nof men who lay down every day new foundations of life, and begin to build\nup fresh hopes even at the brink of the grave.  Look within your own\nmind for individual instances; you will think of old men who are preparing\nthemselves at that very hour for a political career, or for travel, or\nfor business. And what is baser than getting ready to live when you are\nalready old? I should not name the author of this motto, except that it\nis somewhat unknown to fame and is not one of those popular sayings of\nEpicurus which I have allowed myself to praise and to appropriate.\nFarewell.\n<Ep1-83>\nEPISTLE XIV.\n~XIV+ ON THE REASONS FOR WITHDRAWING FROM\nTHE WORLD\nI confess that we all have an inborn affection\nfor our body; I confess that we are entrusted with its guardianship.\nI do not maintain that the body is not to be indulged at all; but I maintain\nthat we must not be slaves+\nto it.  He will have many masters who makes his body his master, who\nis over-fearful in its behalf, {courage+}\nwho judges everything according to the body.  We should conduct ourselves\nnot as if we ought to live for the body, but as if we could not live without\nit.  Our too great love for it makes us restless with fears, burdens\nus with cares, and exposes us to insults.  Virtue is held too cheap\nby the man who counts his body too dear.  We should cherish the body\nwith the greatest care; but we should also be prepared, when reason, self-\nrespect, and duty demand the sacrifice, to deliver it even to the flames.\nLet us, however, in so far as we can, avoid discomforts as well as dangers,\nand withdraw to safe ground, by thinking continually how we may repel all\nobjects of fear.  If I am not mistaken, there are three main classes\nof these: we fear want, we fear sickness, and we fear the\ntroubles+ which result from the violence of the stronger.  And\nof all these, that which shakes us most is the dread which hangs over us\nfrom our neighbour's ascendancy; for it is accompanied by great outcry\nand uproar.  But the natural evils which I have mentioned, - want\nand sickness, steal upon us silently with no shock of terror to the eye\nor to the ear.  The other kind of evil comes,\n<Ep1-85>\nEPISTLE XIV.\nso to speak, in the form of a huge parade.  Surrounding it is a\nretinue of swords and fire and chains and a mob of beasts to be let loose\nupon the disembowelled entrails of men.  Picture to yourself under\nthis head the prison, the cross, the rack, the hook, and the stake which\nthey drive straight through a man until it protrudes from his throat.\nThink of human limbs torn apart by chariots driven in opposite directions,\nof the terrible shirt smeared and interwoven with inflammable materials,\nand of all the other contrivances devised by cruelty, in addition to those\nwhich I have mentioned!/a It is not surprising, then, if our greatest terror\nis of such a fate; for it comes in many shapes and its para phernalia are\nterrifying. For just as the torturer accomplishes more in proportion to\nthe number of instruments which he displays, - indeed, the spectacle overcomes\nthose who would have patiently withstood the suffering, - similarly, of\nall the agencies which coerce and master our minds, the most effective\nare those which can make a display.  Those other troubles are of course\nnot less serious; I mean hunger, thirst, ulcers of the stomach, and fever\nthat parches our very bowels.  They are, however, secret; they have\nno bluster and no heralding; but these, like huge arrays of war, prevail\nby virtue of their display and their equipment.  Let us, therefore,\nsee to it that we abstain from giving offence.  It is sometimes the\npeople that we ought to fear; or sometimes a body of influential oligarchs\nin the Senate, if the method of governing the State is such that most of\nthe business is done by that body; and sometimes individuals equipped with\npower by the people and against the people.  It is burdensome to keep\nthe friendship of all such\n<Ep1-87>\nEPISTLE XIV.\npersons; it is enough not to make enemies of them.  So the wise\nman will never provoke the anger of those in power; nay, he will even turn\nhis course, precisely as he would turn from a storm if he were steering\na ship.  When you travelled to Sicily, you crossed the Straits.\nThe reckless pilot scorned the blustering South Wind, - the wind which\nroughens the Sicilian Sea and forces it into choppy currents; he sought\nnot the shore on the left,/a but the strand hard by the place where Charybdis\nthrows the seas into confusion. Your more careful pilot, however, questions\nthose who know the locality as to the tides and the meaning of the clouds;\nhe holds his course far from that region notorious for its swirling waters.\nOur wise man does the same he shuns a strong man who may be injurious to\nhim, making a point of not seeming to avoid him, because an important part\nof one's safety lies in not seeking safety openly; for what one avoids,\none condemns,\nWe should therefore look about us, and see\nhow we may protect ourselves from the mob.  And first of all, we should\nhave no cravings like theirs; for rivalry results in strife.  Again,\nlet us possess nothing that can be snatched from us to the great profit\nof a plotting foe.  Let there be as little booty as possible on your\nperson. No one sets out to shed the blood of his fellow-men for the sake\nof bloodshed, - at any rate very few.  More murderers speculate on\ntheir profits than give vent to hatred.  If you are empty-handed,\nthe highwayman+ passes you by: even along\nan infested road, the poor may travel in peace./b Next, we must follow\nthe old adage and avoid three things with special care: hatred, jealousy,\nand scorn.  And wisdom alone can show you how this may be done.\nIt is hard to\n<Ep1-89>\nEPISTLE XIV.\nobserve a mean; we must be chary of letting the fear of jealousy lead\nus into becoming objects of scorn, lest, when we choose not to stamp others\ndown, we let them think that they can stamp us down.  The power to\ninspire fear has caused many men to be in fear./a Let us withdraw ourselves\nin every way; for it is as harmful to be scorned as to be admired.\nOne must therefore take refuge in philosophy;\nthis pursuit, not only in the eyes of good men, but also in the eyes of\nthose who are even moderately bad, is a sort of protecting emblem./b For\nspeechmaking at the bar, or any other pursuit that claims the people's\nattention, wins enemies for a man; but philosophy is peaceful and minds\nher own business.  Men cannot scorn her; she is honoured by every\nprofession, even the vilest among them.  Evil can never grow so strong,\nand nobility of character can never be so plotted against, that the name\nof philosophy shall cease to be worshipful and sacred.\nPhilosophy itself, however should be practised\nwith calmness and moderation. \"Very well, then,\" you retort, \"do you regard\nthe philosophy of Marcus Cato as moderate?  Cato's voice strove to\ncheck a civil war.  Cato parted the swords of maddened chieftains.\nWhen some fell foul of Pompey and others fell foul of Caesar, Cato defied\nboth parties at once!\" Nevertheless, one may well question whether, in\nthose days, a wise man ought to have taken any part in public affairs,\nand ask: \"What do you mean, Marcus Cato?  It is not now a question\nof freedom; long since has freedom gone to rack and ruin.  The question\nis, whether it is Caesar or Pompey who controls the State.  Why, Cato,\nshould yo\n<Ep1-91>\nEPISTLE XIV.\ntyrant is being selected.  What does it concern you who conquers?\nThe better man may win; but the winner is bound to be the worse man.\"/a\nI have referred to Cato's final role.  But even in previous years\nthe wise man was not permitted to intervene in such plundering of the state;\nfor what could Cato do but raise his voice and utter unavailing words?\nAt one time he was \"bustled\" by the mob and spat upon and forcibly removed\nfrom the forum and marked for exile; at another, he was taken straight\nto prison from the senate-chamber.  However, we shall consider later/b\nwhether the wise man ought to give his attention to politics; meanwhile,\nI beg you to consider those Stoics who, shut out from public life, have\nwithdrawn into privacy for the purpose of improving men's existence and\nframing laws for the human race without incurring the displeasure of those\nin power. The wise man will not upset the customs of the people, nor will\nhe invite the attention of the populace by any novel ways of living.\n\"What then?  Can one who follows out\nthis Plan be safe in any case?\" I cannot guarantee you this any more than\nI can guarantee good health in the case of a man who observes moderation;\nalthough, as a matter of fact, good health results from such moderation.\nSometimes a vessel perishes in harbour; but what do you think happens on\nthe open sea? And how much more beset with danger that man would be, who\neven in his leisure is not secure, if he were busily working at many things!\nInnocent persons sometimes perish; who would deny that?  But the guilty\nperish more frequently.  A soldier's skill is not at fault if he receives\nthe death-blow through his armour.  And finally, the wise man\n<Ep1-93>\nEPISTLES XIV., XV.\nregards the reason for all his actions, but not the results.  The\nbeginning is in our own power; fortune decides the issue, but I do not\nallow her to pass sentence upon myself.  You may say: \"But she can\ninflict a measure of suffering and of trouble.\" The highwayman does not\npass sentence when he slays.\nNow you are stretching forth your hand for\nthe daily gift.  Golden indeed will be the gift with which I shall\nload you; and, inasmuch as we have mentioned gold, let me tell you how\nits use and enjoyment may bring you greater pleasure. \"He who needs riches\nleast, enjoys riches most.\"/a \"Author's name, please!\" you say.  Now,\nto show you how generous I am, it is my intent to praise the dicta of other\nschools. The phrase belongs to Epicurus, or Metrodorus, or some one of\nthat particular thinking-shop.  But what difference does it make who\nspoke the words?  They were uttered for the world.  He who craves\nriches feels fear on their account. No man, however, enjoys a blessing\nthat brings anxiety; he is always trying to add a little more.  While\nhe puzzles over increasing his wealth, he forgets how to use it.\nHe collects his accounts, he wears out the pavement in the forum, he turns\nover his ledger,/b - in short, he ceases to be master and becomes a steward.\nFarewell.\n~XV+ ON BRAWN AND BRAINS\nThe old Romans had a custom which survived even into\nmy lifetime.  They would add to the opening words of a letter: \"If\nyou are well, it is well; I also am well.\" Persons like ourselves would\ndo\n<Ep1-95>\nEPISTLE XV.\nwell to say. \"If you are studying philosophy, it is well.\" For this\nis just what \"being well\" means.  Without philosophy the mind is sickly,\nand the body, too, though it may be very powerful, is strong only as that\nof a madman or a lunatic is strong.  This, then, is the sort of health\nyou should primarily cultivate; the other kind of health comes second,\nand will involve little effort, if you wish to be well physically.\nIt is indeed foolish, my dear Lucilius, and very unsuitable for a cultivated\nman, to work hard over developing the muscles and broadening the shoulders\nand strengthening the lungs.  For although your heavy feeding produce\ngood results and your sinews grow solid, you can never be a match, either\nin strength or in weight, for a first-class bull.  Besides, by overloading\nthe body with food you strangle the soul and render it less active.\nAccordingly, limit the flesh+ as much as possible,\nand allow free play to the spirit. Many inconveniences beset those who\ndevote themselves to such pursuits. In the first place, they have their\nexercises, at which they must work and waste their life-force and render\nit less fit to bear a strain or the severer studies.  Second, their\nkeen edge is dulled by heavy eating.  Besides, they must take orders\nfrom slaves of the vilest stamp, - men who altemate between the oil-flask/a\nand the flagon, whose day passes satisfactorily if they have got up a good\nperspiration and quaffed, to make good what they have lost in sweat, huge\ndraughis of liquor which will sink deeper because of their fasting.\nDrinking and sweating, - it's the life of a dyspeptic!/b\nNow there are short and simple exercises which\ntire the body rapidly, and so save our time; and time is something of which\nwe ought to keep strict account.\n<Ep1-97>\nEPISTLE XV.\nThese exercises are running, brandishing weights, and jumping, - high-jumping\nor broad-jumping, or the kind which I may call, \"the Priest's dance,\"/a\nor, in slighting terms, \"the clothes-cleaner's jump.\"/b Select for practice\nany one of these, and you will find it plain and easy.  But whatever\nyou do, come back soon from body to mind.  The mind must be exercised\nboth day and night, for it is nourished by moderate labour. and this form\nof exercise need not be hampered by cold or hot weather, or even by old\nage.  Cultivate that good which improves with the years.  Of\ncourse I do not command you to be always bending over your books and your\nwriting materials; the mind must have a change, - but a change of such\na kind that it is not unnerved, but merely unbent.  Riding in a litter\nshakes up the body, and does not interfere with study: one may read, dictate,\nconverse, or listen to another; nor does walking prevent any of these things.\nYou need not scorn voice-culture; but I forbid\nyou to practise raising and lowering your voice by scales and specific\nintonations.  What if you should next propose to take lessons in walking!\nIf you consult the sort of person whom starvation has taught new tricks,\nyou will have someone to regulate your steps, watch every mouthful as you\neat, and go to such lengths as you yourself, by enduring him and believing\nin him, have encouraged his effrontery to go. \"What, then?\" you will ask;\n\"is my voice to begin at the outset with shouting and straining the lungs\nto the utmost?\" No; the natural thing is that it be aroused to such a pitch\nby easy stages, just as persons who are wrangling begin with ordinary conversational\ntones and then pass to shouting at the top of their lungs.  No speaker\ncries \"Help me,\n<Ep1-99>\nEPISTLE XV.\ncitizens!\" at the outset of his speech.  Therefore, whenever your\nspirit's impulse prompts you, raise a hubbub, now in louder now in milder\ntones, according as your voice, as well as your spirit, shall suggest to\nyou, when you are moved to such a performance.  Then let your voice,\nwhen you rein it in and call it back to earth, come down gently, not collapse;\nit should trail off in tones half way between high and low, and should\nnot abruptly drop from its raving in the uncouth manner of countrymen.\nFor our purpose is, not to give the voice exercise, but to make it give\nus exercise.\nYou see, I have relieved you of no slight\nbother; and I shall throw in a little complementary present, - it is Greek,\ntoo.  Here is the proverb; it is an excellent one: \"The fool's life\nis empty of gratitude+ and full of fears;\nits course lies wholly toward the future.\" \"Who uttered these words?\" you\nsay.  The same writer whom I mentioned before./a And what sort of\nlife do you think is meant by the fool's life?  That of Baba and Isio/b?\nNo; he means our own, for we are plunged by our blind desires into ventures\nwhich will harm us, but certainly will never satisfy us; for if we could\nbe satisfied with anything, we should have been satisfied long ago; nor\ndo we reflect how pleasant it is to demand nothing, how noble it is to\nbe contented and not to be dependent upon Fortune.  Therefore continually\nremind yourself, Lucilius, how many ambitions you have attained.\nWhen you see many ahead of you, think how many are behind I If you would\nthank the gods, and be grateful for your past life, you should contemplate\nhow many men you have outstripped.  But what have you to do with the\nothers?  You have outstripped yourself.\n<Ep1-101>\nEPISTLES XV., XVI.\nFix a limit which you will not even desire\nto pass, should you have the power.  At last, then, away with all\nthese treacherous goods!  They look better to those who hope for them\nthan to those who have attained them.  If there were anything substantial\nin them, they would sooner or later satisfy you; as it is, they merely\nrouse the drinkers' thirst.  Away with fripperies which only serve\nfor show!  As to what the future's uncertain lot has in store, why\nshould I demand of Fortune that she give rather than demand of myself that\nI should not crave?  And why should l crave?  Shall I heap up\nmy winnings, and forget that man's lot is unsubstantial?  For what\nend should I toil?  Lo, to-day is the last; if not, it is near the\nlast.  Farewell.\n~XVI+ ON PHILOSOPHY, THE GUIDE OF LIFE\nIt is clear to you, I am sure, Lucilius, that\nno man can live a happy life, or even a supportable life, without the study\nof wisdom; you know also that a happy life is reached when our wisdom is\nbrought to completion, but that life is at least endurable even when our\nwisdom is only begun.  This idea, however, clear though it is, must\nbe strengthened and implanted more deeply by daily reflection; it is more\nimportant for you to keep the resolutions you have already made than to\ngo on and make noble ones.  You must persevere, must develop new strength\nby continuous study, until that which is only a good inclination becomes\na good settled purpose.  Hence you no longer need to come to me with\nmuch talk and protestations; I know that you\n<Ep1-103>\nEPISTLE XVI.\nhave made great progress.  I understand the feelings which prompt\nyour words; they are not feigned or specious words.  Nevertheless\nI shall tell you what I think, - that at present I have hopes for you,\nbut not yet perfect trust.  And I wish that you would adopt the same\nattitude towards yourself; there is no reason why you should put confidence\nin yourself too quickly and readily.  Examine yourself; scrutinize\nand observe yourself in divers ways; but mark, before all else, whether\nit is in philosophy or merely in life itself/a that you have made progress.\nPhilosophy is no trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show.\nIt is a matter, not of words, but of facts.  It is not pursued in\norder that the day may yield some amusement before it is spent, or that\nour leisure may be relieved of a tedium that irks us.  It moulds and\nconstructs the soul; it orders our life, guides our conduct, shows us what\nwe should do and what we should leave undone; it sits at the helm and directs\nour course as we waver+ amid\nuncertainties+. Without it, no one can live fearlessly or in peace\nof mind.  Countless things that happen every hour call for advice;\nand such advice is to be sought in philosophy.\nPerhaps someone will say: \"How can philosophy\nhelp me, if Fate exists?  Of what avail is philosophy, if God rules\nthe universe?  Of what avail is it, if Chance governs everything?\nFor not only is it impossible to change things that are determined, but\nit is also impossible to plan beforehand against what is undetermined;\neither God has forestalled my plans, and decided what I am to do, or else\nFortune+ gives no free play to my plans.\" Whether the truth, Lucilius,\nlies in one or in all of these views, we must be philosophers; whether\nFate binds us down by an\n<Ep1-105>\nEPISTLE XVI.\ninexorable law, or whether God as arbiter of the universe has arranged\neverything, or whether Chance drives and tosses human affairs without method,\nphilosophy ought to be our defence.  She will encourage us to obey\nGod cheerfully, but Fortune defiantly; she will teach us to follow God\nand endure Chance. But it is not my purpose now to be led into a discussion\nas to what is within our own control, - if foreknowledge is supreme, or\nif a chain of fated events drags us along in its clutches, or if the sudden\nand the unexpected play the tyrant over us; I return now to my warning\nand my exhortation, that you should not allow the impulse of your spirit\nto weaken and grow cold.  Hold fast to it and establish it firmly,\nin order that what is now impulse may become a habit of the mind.\nIf I know you well, you have already been\ntrying to find out, from the very beginning of my letter, what little contribution\nit brings to you.  Sift the letter, and you will find it.  You\nneed not wonder at any genius of mine; for as yet I am lavish only with\nother men's property. - But why did I say \" other men\"?  Whatever\nis well said by anyone is mine. This also is a saying of Epicurus/a: \"If\nyou live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according\nto opinion, you will never be rich+.\" Nature's\nwants are slight; the demands of opinion are boundless. Suppose that the\nproperty of many millionaires is heaped up in your possession. Assume that\nfortune carries you far beyond the limits of a private income, decks you\nwith gold, clothes you in purple, and brings you to such a degree of luxury\nand wealth that you can bury the earth under your marble floors; that you\nmay not only possess, but tread upon, riches.  Add statues, paintings,\nand\n<Ep1-107>\nEPISTLES XVI., XVII.\nwhatever any art has devised for the luxury; you will only learn from\nsuch things to crave still greater.\nNatural desires are limited; but those which\nspring from false opinion can have no stopping-point.  The false has\nno limits.  When you are travelling on a road, there must be an end;\nbut when astray, your wanderings are limitless.  Recall your steps,\ntherefore, from idle things, and when you would know whether that which\nyou seek is based upon a natural or upon a misleading desire, consider\nwhether it can stop at any defiinite point.  If you find, after having\ntravelled far, that there is a more distant goal always in view, you may\nbe sure that this condition is contrary to nature.  Farewell.\n~XVII+ ON PHILOSOPHY AND RICHES\nCast away everything of that sort, if you are\nwise; nay, rather that you may be wise; strive toward a sound mind at top\nspeed and with your whole strength.  If any bond holds you back, untie\nit, or sever it. \" But,\" you say, \"my estate delays me; I wish to make\nsuch disposition of it that it may suffice for me when I have nothing to\ndo, lest either poverty be a burden to me, or I myself a burden to others.\"\nYou do not seem, when you say this, to know the strength and power of that\ngood which you are considering.  You do indeed grasp the all important\nthing, the great benefit which philosophy confers, but you do not yet discern\naccurately its various functions, nor do you yet know how great is the\nhelp we receive from philosophy in everything, everywhere, - how, (to use\nCicero's language,/a) it\n<Ep1-109>\nEPISTLE XVII.\nnot only succours us in the greatest matters but also descends to the\nsmallest.  Take my advice; call wisdom into consultation; she will\nadvise you not to sit for ever at your ledger.  Doubtless, your object,\nwhat you wish to attain by such postponement of your studies, is that poverty\nmay not have to be feared by you.  But what if it is something to\nbe desired? Riches have shut off many a man from the attainment of wisdom;\npoverty is unburdened and free from care.  When the trumpet sounds,\nthe poor man knows that he is not being attacked; when there is a cry of\n\"Fire,\"/a he only seeks a way of escape, and does not ask what he can save;\nif the poor man must go to sea, the harbour does not resound, nor do the\nwharves bustle with the retinue of one individual.  No throng of slaves\nsurrounds the poor man, - slaves for whose mouths the master must covet\nthe fertile crops of regions beyond the sea.  It is easy to fill a\nfew stomachs, when they are well trained and crave nothing else but to\nbe filled.  Hunger costs but little; squeamishness costs much.\nPoverty is contented with fulfilling pressing needs.\nWhy, then, should you reject Philosophy as\na comrade?  Even the rich man copies her ways when he is in his senses.\nIf you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble\na poor man.  Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live\nsimply; and living simply is voluntary poverty.  Away, then, with\nall excuses like: \"I have not yet enough; when I have gained the desired\namount, then I shall devote myself wholly to philosophy.\" And yet this\nideal, which you are putting off and placing second to other interests,\nshould be secured first of all; you should begin with it.  You\n<Ep1-111>\nEPISTLE XVII.\nretort: \"I wish to acquire something to live on.\" Yes, but learn while\nyou are acquiring it; for if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing\nforbids you to die nobly.  There is no reason why poverty should call\nus away from philosophy, - no, nor even actual want.  For when hastening\nafter wisdom, we must endure even hunger.  Men have endured hunger\nwhen their towns were besieged, and what other reward for their endurance\ndid they obtain than that they did not fall under the conqueror's power?\nHow much greater is the promise of the prize of everlasting\nliberty+, and the assurance that we need fear neither God nor man!\nEven though we starve, we must reach that goal.  Armies have endured\nall manner of want, have lived on roots, and have resisted hunger by means\nof food too revolting to mention.  All this they have suffered to\ngain a kingdom, and, - what is more marvellous,to gain a kingdom that will\nbe another's.  Will any man hesitate to endure poverty, in order that\nhe may free his mind from madness?\nTherefore one should not seek to lay up riches{Jesus+}\nfirst; one may attain to philosophy, however, even without money for the\njourney.  It is indeed so.  After you have come to possess all\nother things, shall you then wish to possess wisdom also?  Is philosophy\nto be the last requisite in life, - a sort of supplement?  Nay, your\nplan should be this: be a philosopher now, whether you have anything or\nnot, - for if you have anything, how do you know that you have not too\nmuch already? - but if you have nothing, seek understanding first, before\nanything else. \"But,\" you say, \"I shall lack the necessities of life.\"\nIn the first place, you cannot lack them; because nature demands but little,\nand the wise man\n<Ep1-113>\nEPISTLE XVII.\nsuits his needs to nature.  But if the utmost pinch of need arrives,\nhe will quickly take leave of life and cease being a trouble to himself.\nIf, however, his means of existence are meagre and scanty, he will make\nthe best of them, without being anxious or worried about anything more\nthan the bare necessities; he will do justice to his belly and his shoulders;\nwith free and happy spirit he will laugh at the bustling of rich men, and\nthe flurried ways of those who are hastening after wealth, and say: \"Why\nof your own accord postpone your real life to the distant future?\nShall you wait for some interest to fall due, or for some income on your\nmerchandise, or for a place in the will of some wealthy old man, when you\ncan be rich here and now.  Wisdom offers wealth in ready money, and\npays it over to those in whose eyes she has made wealth superfluous.\" These\nremarks refer to other men; you are nearer the rich class.  Change\nthe age in which you live, and you have too much.  But in every age,\nwhat is enough remains the same.\nI might close my letter at this point, if\nI had not got you into bad habits.  One cannot greet Parthian royalty\nwithout bringing a gift; and in your case I cannot say farewell without\npaying a price.  But what of it?  I shall borrow from Epicurus/a:\n\"The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change,\nof troubles.\" I do not wonder.  For the fault is not in the\nwealth+, but in the mind itself. That which had made poverty a burden\nto us, has made riches also a burden. Just as it matters little whether\nyou lay a sick man on a wooden or on a golden bed, for whithersoever he\nbe moved he will carry his malady with him; so one need not care whether\nthe diseased mind is be-\n<Ep1-115>\nEPISTLES XVII., XVIII.\nstowed upon riches or upon poverty.  His malady goes with the man.\nFarewell,\n~XVIII+ ON FESTIVALS AND FASTING\nIt is the month of December, and yet the city\nis at this very moment in a sweat.  License is given to the general\nmerrymaking. Everything resounds with mighty preparations, - as if the\nSaturnalia differed at all from the usual business day!  So true it\nis that the difference is nil, that I regard as correct the remark of the\nman who said: \"Once December was a month; now it is a year.\"/a\nIf I had you with me, I should be glad to\nconsult you and find out what you think should be done, - whether we ought\nto make no change in our daily routine, or whether, in order not to be\nout of sympathy with the ways of the public, we should dine in gayer fashion\nand doff the toga./b As it is now, we Romans have changed our dress for\nthe sake of pleasure and holiday-making, though in former times that was\nonly customary when the State was disturbed and had fallen on evil days.\nI am sure that, if I know you aright, playing the part of an umpire you\nwould have wished that we should be neither like the liberty-capped/c throng\nin all ways, nor in all ways unlike them; unless, perhaps, this is just\nthe season when we ought to lay down the law to the soul, and bid it be\nalone in refraining from pleasures just when the whole mob has let itself\ngo in pleasures; for this is the surest proof which a man can get of his\nown constancy, if he neither seeks the things which are seductive and allure\nhim to luxury, nor is led into them.  It shows much\n<Ep1-117>\nEPISTLE XVIII.\nmore courage to remain dry and sober when the mob is drunk and vomiting;\nbut it shows greater self-control to refuse to withdraw oneself and to\ndo what the crowd does, but in a different way, - thus neither making oneself\nconspicuous nor becoming one of the crowd.  For one may keep holiday\nwithout extravagance.  I am so firmly determined, however, to test\nthe constancy of your mind that, drawing from the teachings of great men,\nI shall give you also a lesson:  Set aside a certain number of days,\nduring which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare,\nwith coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: \"Is this the\ncondition that I feared?\" It is precisely in times of immunity from care\nthat the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater\nstress, and it is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against\nher violence. In days of peace the soldier performs manoeuvres, throws\nup earthworks with no enemy in sight, and wearies himself by gratuitous\ntoil, in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil.  If you would\nnot have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train him before it comes.\nSuch is the course which those men I have followed who, in their imitation\nof poverty, have every month come almost to want, that they might never\nrecoil from what they had so often rehearsed.\nYou need not suppose that I mean meals likeTimon+'s,\nor \"paupers' huts,\"/b or any other device which luxurious millionaires\nuse to beguile the tedium of their lives.  Let the pallet be a real\none, and the coarse cloak; let the bread be hard and grimy.  Endure\nall this for three or four days at a time, sometimes for more, so that\nit may be a test of yourself instead of a mere hobby.  Then, I assure\n<Ep1-119>\nEPISTLE XVIII.\nyou, my dear Lucilius, you will leap for joy when filled with a pennyworth\nof food, and you will understand that a man's peace of mind does not depend\nupon Fortune; for, even when angry she grants enough for our needs.\nThere is no reason, however, why you should\nthink that you are doing anything great; for you will merely be doing what\nmany thousands of slaves and many thousands of poor men are doing every\nday.  But you may credit yourself with this item, - that you will\nnot be doing it under compulsion, and that it will be as casy for you to\nendure it permanently as to make the experiment from time to time.\nLet us practise our strokes on the \"dummy\"/a; let us become intimate with\npoverty, so that Fortune may not catch us off our guard.  We shall\nbe rich with all the more comfort, if we once learn how far poverty is\nfrom being a burden.\nEven Epicurus, the teacher of pleasure, used\nto observe stated intervals, during which he satisfied his hunger in niggardly\nfashion; he wished to see whether he thereby fell short of full and complete\nhappiness, and, if so, by what amount be fell short, and whether this amount\nwas worth purchasing at the price of great effort.  At any rate, he\nmakes such a statement in the well known letter written to Polyaenus in\nthe archonship of Charinus./b Indeed, he boasts that he himself lived on\nless than a penny, but that Metrodorus, whose progress was not yet so great,\nneeded a whole penny.  Do you think that there can be fulness on such\nfare?  Yes, and there is pleasure also, - not that shifty and fleeting\nPleasure which needs a fillip now and then, but a pleasure that is steadfast\nand sure.  For though water, barley-meal, and crusts of barley-bread,\nare\n<Ep1-121>\nEPISTLE XVIII.\nnot a cheerful diet, yet it is the highest kind of Pleasure to be able\nto derive pleasure from this sort of food, and to have reduced one's needs\nto that modicum which no unfairness of Fortune can snatch away.  Even\nprison fare is more generous; and those who have been set apart for capital\npunishment are not so meanly fed by the man who is to execute them.\nTherefore, what a noble soul must one have, to descend of one's own free\nwill to a diet which even those who have been sentenced to death have not\nto fear!  This is indeed forestalling the spearthrusts of\nFortune+. {Hamlet+}\nSo begin, my dear Lucilius, to follow the\ncustom of these men, and set apart certain days on which you shall withdraw\nfrom your business and make yourself at home with the scantiest fare.\nEstablish business relations with poverty.\nDare, O my friend, to scorn the sight of wealth,\nAnd mould thyself to kinship with thy God./a\nFor he alone is in kinship with God who has scorned\nwealth.  Of course I do not forbid you to possess it, but I would\nhave you reach the point at which you possess it dauntlessly; this can\nbe accomplished only by persuading yourself that you can live happily without\nit as well as with it, and by regarding riches always as likely to elude\nyou.\nBut now I must begin to fold up my letter.\n\"Settle your debts first,\" vou cry.  Here is a draft on Epicurus;\nhe will pay down the sum: \"Ungoverned anger+\nbegets madness.\"/b You cannot help knowing the truth of these words, since\nyou have had not only slaves, but also enemies.  But indeed this emotion\nblazes out against all sorts of persons; it springs from love as much as\nfrom hate, and shows\n<Ep1-123>\nEPISTLES XVIII., XIX.\nitself not less in serious matters than in jest and sport.  And\nit makes no difference how important the provocation may be, but into what\nkind of soul it penetrates.  Similarly with fire; it does not matter\nhow great is the flame, but what it falls upon.  For solid timbers\nhave repelled a very great fire; conversely, dry and easily inflammable\nstuff nourishes the slightest spark into a conflagration.  So it is\nwith anger, my dear Lucilius; the outcome of a mighty anger is madness,\nand hence anger should be avoided, not merely that we may escape excess,\nbut that we may have a healthy mind.  Farewell.\n~XIX+ ON WORLDLINESS AND RETIREMENT\nI leap for joy whenever I receive letters from\nyou.  For they fill me with hope; they are now not mere assurances\nconcerning you, but guarantees.  And I beg and pray you to proceed\nin this course; for what better request could I make of a friend than one\nwhich is to be made for his own sake?  If possible, withdraw yourself\nfrom all the business of which you speak; and if you cannot do this, tear\nyourself away.  We have dissipated enough of our time already - let\nus in old age begin to pack up our baggage.  Surely there is nothing\nin this that men can begrudge us. We have spent our lives on the high seas;\nlet us die in harbour.  Not that I would advise you to try to win\nfame by your retirement; one's retirement should neither be paraded nor\nconcealed.  Not concealed, I say, for I shall not go so far in urging\nyou as to expect you to condemn all men as mad and then seek out for yourself\na hiding-place and oblivion; {Timon+}\nrather make this your business, that your\n<Ep1-125>\nEPISTLE XIX.\nretirement be not conspicuous, though it should be obvious.  In\nthe second place, while those whose choice is unhampered from the start\nwill deliberate on that other question, whether they wish to pass their\nlives in obscurity, in your case there is not a free choice.  Your\nability and energy have thrust you into the work of the world; so have\nthe charm of your writings and the friendships you have made with famous\nand notable men.  Renown has already taken you by storm.  You\nmay sink yourself into the depths of obscurity and utterly hide yourself;\nyet your earlier acts will reveal you.  You cannot keep lurking in\nthe dark; much of the old gleam will follow you wherever you fly.\nPeace you can claim for yourself without being disliked by anyone, without\nany sense of loss, and without any pangs of spirit.  For what will\nyou leave behind you that you can imagine yourself reluctant to leave?\nYour clients?  But none of these men courts you for yourself; they\nmerely court something from you.  People used to hunt friends, but\nnow they hunt pelf; if a lonely old man changes his will, the morning-caller\ntransfers himself to another door.  Great things cannot be bought\nfor small sums; so reckon up whether it is preferable to leave your own\ntrue self, or merely some of your belongings.  Would that you had\nhad the privilege of growing old amid the limited circumstances of your\norigin, and that fortune had not raised you to such heights!  You\nwere removed far from the sight of wholesome living by your swift rise\nto prosperity, by your province, by your position as procurator,/a and\nby all that such things promise; you will next acquire more important duties\nand after them still more.  And what will be the result?  Why\nwait until there is nothing left for\n<Ep1-127>\nEPISTLE XIX,\nyou to crave?  That time will never come.  We hold that there\nis a succession of causes, from which fate is woven; similarly, you may\nbe sure, there is a succession in our desires; for one begins where its\npredecessor ends. You have been thrust into an existence which will never\nof itself put an end to your wretchedness and your slavery.  Withdraw\nyour chafed neck from the yoke; it is better that it should be cut off\nonce for all, than galled for ever.  If you retreat to privacy, everything\nwill be on a smaller scale, but you will be satisfied abundantly; in your\npresent condition, however, there is no satisfaction in the plenty which\nis heaped upon you on all sides.  Would you rather be poor and sated,\nor rich and hungry?  Prosperity is not only greedy, but it also lies\nexposed to the greed of others.  And as long as nothing satisfies\nyou, you yourself cannot satisfy others.\n\"But,\" you say, \"how can I take my leave?\"\nAny way you please.  Reflect how many hazards you have ventured for\nthe sake of money, and how much toil you have undertaken for a title!\nYou must dare something to gain leisure, also, - or else grow old amid\nthe worries of procuratorships/a abroad and subsequently of civil duties\nat home, living in turmoil and in ever fresh floods of responsibilities,\nwhich no man has ever succeeded in avoiding by unobtrusiveness or by seclusion\nof life. For what bearing on the case has your personal desire for a secluded\nlife? Your position in the world desires the opposite!  What if, even\nnow, you allow that position to grow greater?  But all that is added\nto your successes will be added to your fears.  At this point I should\nlike to quote a saying of Maecenas, who spoke the truth when be stood on\nthe very\n<Ep1-129>\nEPISTLE XIX.\nsummit: \"There's thunder even on the loftiest peaks.\" If you ask me\nin what book these words are found, they occur in the volume entitled Prometheus./b\nHe simply meant to say that these lofty peaks have their tops surrounded\nwith thunder-storms.  But is any power worth so high a price that\na man like you would ever, in order to obtain it, adopt a style so debauched\nas that?/c Maecenas was indeed a man of parts, who would have left a great\npattern for Roman oratory to follow, had his good fortune not made himeffeminate+,\n- nay, had it not emasculated him!  An end like his awaits you also,\nunless you forthwith shorten sail and, - as Maecenas was not willing to\ndo until it was too late, - hug the shore!\nThis saying of Maecenas's might have squared\nmy account with you; but I feel sure, knowing you, that you will get out\nan injunction against me, and that you will be unwilling to accept payment\nof my debt in such crude and debased currency.  However that may be,\nI shall draw on the account of Epicurus./d He says: \"You must reflect carefully\nbeforehand with whom you are to cat end drink, rather than what you are\nto eat and drink.  For a dinner of meats without the company of a\nfriend+ is like the life of a lion or a wolf.\" This privilege will\nnot be yours unless you withdraw from the world; otherwise, you will have\nas guests only those whom your slave-secretary/e sorts out from the throng\nof callers. It is, however, a mistake to select your friend in the reception-hall\nor to test him at the dinner-table.  The most serious misfortune for\na busy man who is overwhelmed by his possessions is, that he believes men\nto be his friends when he himself is not a friend to them, and that he\ndeems his favours to be effective in winning friends, although, in the\n<Ep1-131>\nEPISTLES XIX., XX.\ncase of certain men, the more they owe, the more they hate.  A\ntrifling debt makes a man your debtor; a large one makes him an enemy.\n\"What,\" you say, \"do not kindnesses establish friendships?\" {Timon+}\nThey do, if one has had the privilege of choosing those who are to receive\nthem, and if they are placed judiciously, instead of being scattered broadcast.\nTherefore, while you are beginning to call\nyour mind your own, meantime apply this maxim of the wise: consider that\nit is more important who receives a thing, than what it is he receives.\nFarewell.\n~XX+ ON PRACTISING WHAT YOU PREACH\nIf you are in good health and if you think\nyourself worthy of becoming at last your own master, I am glad.  For\nthe credit will be mine, if I can drag you from the floods in which you\nare being buffeted without hope of emerging.  This, however, my dear\nLucilius, I ask and beg of you, on your part, that you let wisdom sink\ninto your soul, and test your progress, not by mere speech or writings,\nbut by stoutness of heart and decrease of desire.  Prove your words\nby your deeds.\nFar different is the purpose of those who\nare speech-making and trying to win the approbation of a throng of hearers,\nfar different that of those who allure the ears of young men and idlers\nby manysided or fluent argumentation; philosophy teaches us to act, not\nto speak; it exacts of every man that he should live according to his own\nstandards, that his life should not be out of harmony with his words, and\nthat, further, his inner life should be of one hue and not out of harmony\nwith all his activities.  This, I say, is the highest duty and the\nhighest proof of\n<Ep1-133>\nEPISTLE XX.\nwisdom, - that deed and word should be in accord, that a man should\nbe equal to himself under all conditions, and always the same. {PlainDealer+}\nBut,\" you reply, \"who can maintain this standard?\"\nVery few, to be sure; but there are some.  It is indeed a hard undertaking,\nand I do not say that the philosopher can always keep the same pace.\nBut he can always travel the same path.  Observe yourself, then, and\nsee whether your dress and your house are inconsistent, whether you treat\nyourself lavishly and your family meanly, whether you eat frugal dinners\nand yet build luxurious houses.  You should lay hold, once for all,\nupon a single norm to live by, and should regulate your whole life according\nto this norm.  Some men restrict themselves at home, but strut with\nswelling port before the public; such discordance is a fault, and it indicates\na wavering mind which cannot yet keep its balance.  And I can tell\nyou, further, whence arise this unsteadiness and disagreement of action\nand purpose; it is because no man resolves upon what he wishes, and, even\nif be has done so, he does not persist in it, but jumps the track; not\nonly does he change, but he returns and slips back to the conduct which\nhe has abandoned and abjured. Therefore, to omit the ancient definitions\nof wisdom and to include the whole manner of human life, I can be satisfied\nwith the following: \"What is wisdom?  Always desiring the same things,\nand always refusing the same things.\"/a You may be excused from adding\nthe little proviso, - that what you wish, should be right; since no man\ncan always be satisfied with the same thing, unless it is right.\nFor this reason men do not know what they\nwish, except at the actual moment of wishing; no man\n<Ep1-135>\nEPISTLE XX.\never decided once and for all to desire or to refuse.  Judgment\nvaries from day to day, and changes to the opposite, making many a man\npass his life in a kind of game.  Press on, therefore, as you have\nbegun; perhaps you will be led to perfection, or to a point which you alone\nunderstand is still short of perfection. \"But what,\" you say, \"will become\nof my crowded household without a household income?\" If you stop supporting\nthat crowd, it will support itself; or perhaps you will learn by the bounty\nof poverty what you cannot learn by your own bounty.\nPoverty+ will keep for you your true and tried friends; you will be\nrid of the men who were not seeking you for yourself, but for something\nwhich you have. {Timon+} Is it not true,\nhowever, that you should love poverty, if only for this single reason,\n- that it will show you those by whom you are loved?  O when will\nthat time come, when no one shall tell lies to compliment you!  Accordingly,\nlet your thoughts, your efforts, your desires, help to make you content\nwith your own self and with the goods that spring from yourself; and commit\nall your other prayers to God's keeping!  What happiness could come\ncloser home to you?  Bring yourself down to humble conditions, from\nwhich you cannot be ejected and in order that you may do so with greater\nalacrity, the contribution contained in this letter shall refer to that\nsubject; I shall bestow it upon you forthwith.\nAlthough you may look askance, Epicurus/a\nwill once again be glad to settle my indebtedness: \"Believe me, your words\nwill be more imposing if you sleep on a cot and wear rags.  For in\nthat case you will not be merely saying them; you will be demonstrating\ntheir truth.\" I, at any rate, listen in\n<Ep1-137>\nEPISTLE XX.\na different spirit to the utterances of our friend Demetrius, after\nI have seen him reclining without even a cloak to cover him, and, more\nthan this, without rugs to lie upon.  He is not only a teacher of\nthe truth, but a witness to the truth. \"May not a man, however, despise\nwealth when it lies in his very pocket?\" Of course; he also is great-souled,\nwho seesriches+ heaped up round him and,\nafter wondering long and deeply because they have come into his possession,\nsmiles, and hears rather than feels that they are his.  It means much\nnot to be spoiled by intimacy with riches; and he is truly great who is\npoor amidst riches. \"Yes, but I do not know,\" you say, \"how the man you\nspeak of will endure poverty, if he falls into it suddenly.\" Nor do I,\nEpicurus, know whether the poor man you speak of will despise riches, should\nhe suddenly fall into them; accordingly, in the case of both, it is the\nmind that must be appraised, and we must investigate whether your man is\npleased with his poverty, and whether my man is displeased with his riches.\nOtherwise, the cot-bed and the rags are slight proof of his good intentions,\nif it has not been made clear that the person concerned endures these trials\nnot\nfrom necessity but from preference.\nIt is the mark, however, of a noble spirit\nnot to precipitate oneself into such things a on the ground that they are\nbetter, but to practise for them on the ground that they are thus easy\nto endure.  And they are easy to endure, Lucilius; when, however,\nyou come to them after long rehearsal, they are even pleasant; for they\ncontain a sense of freedom from care, - and without this nothing is pleasant.\nI hold it essential, therefore, to do as I have told you in a letter that\ngreat men have often done: to reserve a\n<Ep1-139>\nEPISTLFS XX., XXI.\nfew days in which we may prepare ourselves for real poverty by means\nof fancied poverty.  There is all the more reason for doing this,\nbecause we have been steeped in luxury and regard all duties as hard and\nonerous. Rather let the soul be roused from its sleep and be prodded, and\nlet it be reminded that nature has prescribed very little for us.\nNo man is born rich.  Every man, when he first sees light, is commanded\nto be content with milk and rags.  Such is our beginning, and yet\nkingdoms are all too small for us!/a Farewell.\n~XXI+ ON THE RENOWN WHICH MY WRITINGS WILL\nBRING YOU\nDo you conclude that you are having difficulties\nwith those men about whom you wrote to me?  Your greatest difficulty\nis with yourself; for you are your own stumbling-block.  You do not\nknow what you want.  You are better at approving the right course\nthan at following it out.  You see where the true happiness lies,\nbut you have not the courage to attain it.  Let me tell you what it\nis that hinders you, inasmuch as you do not of yourself discern it.\nYou think that this condition, which you are to abandon, is one of importance,\nand after resolving upon that ideal state of calm into which you hope to\npass, you are held back by the lustre of your present life, from which\nit is your intention to depart, just as if you were about to fall into\na state of filth and darkness.  This is a mistake, Lucilius; to go\nfrom your present life into the ot\n<Ep1-141>\nEPISTLE XXI.\nthese two lives as there is between mere brightness and real light;\nthe latter has a definite source within itself, the other borrows its radiance;\nthe one is called forth by an illumination coming from the outside, and\nanyone who stands between the source and the object immediately turns the\nlatter into a dense shadow; but the other has a glow that comes from within.\nIt is your own studies that will make you\nshine and will render you eminent, Allow me to mention the case of Epicurus.\nHe was writing to Idomeneus and trying to recall him from a showy existence\nto sure and steadfast renown.  Idomeneus was at that time a minister\nof state who exercised a rigorous authority and had important affairs in\nhand. \"If,\" said Epicurus, \"you are attracted by fame, my letters will\nmake you more renowned than all the things which you cherish and which\nmake you cherished.\" Did Epicurus speak falsely?  Who would have known\nof Idomeneus, had not the philosopher thus engraved his name in those letters\nof his? All the grandees and satraps, even the king himself, who was petitioned\nfor the title which Idomeneus sought, are sunk in deep oblivion.\nCicero's letters keep the name of Atticus from perishing.  It would\nhave profited Atticus nothing to have an Agrippa for a son-in-law, a Tiberius\nfor the husband of his grand-daughter, and a Drusus Caesar for a great-grandson;\namid these mighty names his name would never be spoken, had not Cicero\nbound him to himself./b The deep flood of time will roll over us; some\nfew great men will raise their heads above it, and, though destined at\nthe last to depart into the same realms of silence, will battle against\noblivion and maintain their ground for long.\n<Ep1-143>\nEPISTLE XXI.\nThat which Epicurus could promise his friend, this I promise you, Lucilius.\nI shall find favour among later generations; I can take with me names that\nwill endure as long as mine.  Our poet Vergil promised an eternal\nname to two heroes, and is keeping his promise:/a\nBlest heroes twain!  If power my song possess,\nThe record of your names shall never be\nErased from out the book of Time, while yet Aeneas' tribe shall keep\nthe Capitol,\nThat rock immovable, and Roman sire Shall empire hold.\nWhenever men have been thrust forward by fortune,\nwhenever they have become part and parcel of another's influence, they\nhave found abundant favour, their houses have been thronged, only so long\nas they themselves have kept their position; when they themselves have\nleft it, they have slipped at once from the memory of men.  But in\nthe case of innate ability, the respect in which it is held increases,\nand not only does honour+ accrue to the man\nhimself, but whatever has attached itself to his memory is passed on from\none to another.\nIn order that Idomeneus may not be introduced\nfree of charge into my letter, he shall make up the indebtedness from his\nown account.  It was to him that Epicurus addressed the well-known\nsaying/c urging him to make Pythocles rich, but not rich in the vulgar\nand equivocal way. \"If you wish,\" said he, \"to make Pythocles rich, do\nnot add to his store of money, but subtract from his desires.\" This idea\nis too clear to need explanation, and too clever to need reinforcement.\nThere is, however, one point on which I would warn you, -not to co\n<Ep1-145>\nEPISTLE XXI.\nbe the same, no matter how you apply it. \"If you wish to make Pythocles\nhonourable, do not add to his honours+,\nbut subtract from his desires\"; \"if you wish Pythocles to have pleasure\nfor ever, do not add to his pleasures, but subtract from his desires\";\n\"if you wish to make Pythocles an old man, filling his life to the full,\ndo not add to his years, but subtract from his desires.\" There is no reason\nwhy you should hold that these words belong to Epicurus alone; they are\npublic property.  I think we ought to do in philosophy as they are\nwont to do in the Senate: when someone has made a motion, of which I approve\nto a certain extent, I ask him to make his motion in two parts, and I vote\nfor the part which I approve.  So I am all the more glad to repeat\nthe distinguished words of Epicurus, in order that I may prove to those\nwho have recourse to him through a bad motive, thinking that they will\nhave in him a screen for their own vices, that they must live honourably,\nno matter what school they follow.\nGo to his Garden and read the motto carved\nthere: \"Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good\nis pleasure.\" The care-taker of that abode, a kindly host, will be ready\nfor you; he will welcome you with barley-meal and serve you water also\nin abundance, with these words: \"Have you not been well entertained?\" \"This\ngarden,\" he says, \"does not whet your appetite; it quenches it.  Nor\ndoes it make you more thirsty with every drink; it slakes the thirst by\na natural cure, a cure that demands no fee.  This is the 'pleasure'\nin which I have grown old.\"\nTn speaking with you, however, I refer to\nthose desires which refuse alleviation, which must be\n<Ep1-147>\nEPISTLES XXI., XXII.\nbribed to cease.  For in regard to the exceptional desires, which\nmay be postponed, which may be chastened and checked, I have this one thought\nto share with you: a pleasure of that sort is according to our nature,\nbut it is not according to our needs; one owes nothing to it; whatever\nis expended upon it is a free gift.  The belly will not listen to\nadvice; it makes demands, it importunes.  And yet it is not a troublesome\ncreditor; you can send it away at small cost, provided only that you give\nit what you owe, not merely all you are able to give.  Farewell.\n~XXII+ ON THE FUTILITY OF HALF-WAY MEASURES\nYou understand by this time that you must withdraw\nyourself from those showy and depraved pursuits; but you still wish to\nknow how this may be accomplished.  There are certain things which\ncan be pointed out only by someone who is present.  The physician\ncannot prescribe by letter the proper time for eating or bathing; he must\nfeel the pulse. There is an old adage about gladiators, - that they plan\ntheir fight in the ring; as they intently watch, something in the adversary's\nglance, some movement of his hand, even some slight bending of his body,\ngives a warning.  We can formulate general rules and commit them to\nwriting, as to what is usually done, or ought to be done; such advice may\nbe given, not only to our absent friends, but also to succeeding generations.\nIn regard, however, to that second/a question, - when or how your pl\n<Ep1-149>\nEPISTLE XXII.\nwe must take counsel in the presence of the actual situation, You must\nbe not only present in the body, but watchful in mind, if you would avail\nyourself of the fleeting opportunity.  Accordingly, look about you\nfor the opportunity; if you see it, grasp it, and with all your energy\nand with all your strength devote yourself to this task - to rid yourself\nof thosebusiness+\nduties.  Now listen carefully to the opinion which I shall offer;\nit is my opinion that you should withdraw either from that kind of existence,\nor else from existence altogether.  But I likewise maintain that you\nshould take a gentle path, that you may loosen rather than cut the knot\nwhich you have bungled so badly in tying, - provided that if there shall\nbe no other way of loosening it, you may actually cut it.  No man\nis so faint- hearted that he would rather hang in suspense for ever than\ndrop once for all. {Hamlet+}\nMeanwhile, - and this is of first importance, - do not hamper yourself;\nbe content with the business into which you have lowered yourself, or,\nas you prefer to have people think, have tumbled.  There is no reason\nwhy you should be struggling on to something further; if you do, you will\nlose all grounds of excuse, and men will see that it was not a tumble.\nThe usual explanation which men offer is wrong: \"I was compelled to do\nit.  Suppose it was against my will; I had to do it.\" But no one is\ncompelled to pursue prosperity at top speed; it means something to call\na halt, - even if one does not offer resistance, -instead of pressing eagerly\nafter favouring fortune.  Shall you then be put out with me, if I\nnot only come to advise you, but also call in others to advise you, - wiser\nheads than my own, men before whom I am wont to lay any problem upon\n<Ep1-151>\nEPISTLE XXII.\nwhich l am pondering?  Read the letter of Epicurus/a which appears\non this matter; it is addressed to Idomeneus.  The writer asks him\nto hasten as fast as he can, and beat a retreat before some stronger influence\ncomes between and takes from him the liberty to withdraw.  But he\nalso adds that one should attempt nothing except at the time when it can\nbe attempted suitably and seasonably.  Then, when the long-sought\noccasion comes, let him be up and doing.  Epicurus forbids/b us to\ndoze when we are meditating escape; he bids us hope for a safe release\nfrom even the hardest trials, provided that we are not in too great a hurry\nbefore the time, nor too dilatory when the time arrives.\nNow, I suppose, you are looking for a Stoic\nmotto also.  There is really no reason why anyone should slander that\nschool to you on the ground of its rashness; as a matter of fact, its caution\nis greater than its courage+.  You\nare perhaps expecting the sect to utter such words as these: \"It is base\nto flinch under a burden.  Wrestle with the duties which you have\nonce undertaken.  No man is brave and earnest if he avoids danger,\nif his spirit does not grow with the very difficulty of his task.\" Words\nlike these will indeed be spoken to you, if only your perseverance shall\nhave an object that is worth while, if only you will not have to do or\nto suffer anything unworthy of a good man; besides, a good man will not\nwaste himself upon mean and discreditable work or be busy merely for the\nsake of being busy.  Neither will he, as you imagine, become so involved\nin ambitious schemes that he will have continually to endure their ebb\nand flow.  Nay, when he sees the dangers, uncertainties, and hazards\nin which he was formerly tossed about, he will withdraw, - not turn-\n<Ep1-153>\nEPISTLE XXII.\ning his back to the foe, but falling back little by little to a safe\nposition.  From business, however, my dear Lucilius, it is easy to\nescape, if only you will despise the rewards of\nbusiness+.  We are held back and kept from escaping by thoughts\nlike these: \"What then?  Shall I leave behind me these great prospects?\nShall I depart at the very time of harvest?  Shall I have no slaves\nat my side? no retinue for my litter? no crowd in my reception room?\" Hence\nmen leave such advantages as these with reluctance; they love the reward\nof their hardships, but curse the hardships themselves.  Men complain\nabout their ambitions as they complain about their mistresses; in other\nwords, if you penetrate their real feelings, you will find, not hatred,\nbut bickering.  Search the minds of those who cry down what they have\ndesired, who talk about escaping from things which they are unable to do\nwithout; you will comprehend that they are lingering of their own free\nwill in a situation which they declare they find it hard and wretched to\nendure.  It is so, my dear Lucilius; there are a few men whom\nslavery+ holds fast, but there are many more who hold fast to slavery.\nIf, however, you intend to be rid of this\nslavery; if freedom is genuinely pleasing in your eyes; and if you seek\ncounsel for this one purpose, - that you may have the good fortune to accomplish\nthis purpose without perpetual annoyance, - how can the whole company of\nStoic thinkers fail to approve your course?  Zeno, Cbrysippus, and\nall their kind will give you advice that is temperate, honourable, and\nsuitable. But if you keep turning round and looking about, in order to\nsee how much you may\n<Ep1-155>\nEPISTLE XXII.\ncarry away with you, and how much money you may keep to equip yourself\nfor the life of leisure, you will never find a way out.  No man can\nswim ashore and take his baggage with him.  Rise to a higher life,\nwith the favour of the gods; but let it not be favour of such a kind as\nthe gods give to men when with kind and genial faces they bestow magnificent\nills, justified in so doing by the one fact that the things which irritate\nand torture have been bestowed in answer to prayer.\nI was just putting the seal upon this letter;\nbut it must be broken again, in order that it may go to you with its customary\ncontribution, bearing with it some noble word.  And lo, here is one\nthat occurs to my mind; I do not know whether its truth or its nobility\nof utterance is the greater. \"Spoken by whom?\" you ask.  By Epicurus/a;\nfor I am still appropriating other men's belongings.  The words are:\n\"Everyone goes out of life just as if he had but lately entered it.\" Take\nanyone off his guard, young, old, or middle-aged; you will find that all\nare equally afraid of death, and equally ignorant of life.  No one\nhas anything finished, because we have kept putting off into the future\nall our undertakings./b No thought in the quotation given above pleases\nme more than that it taunts old men with being infants. \"No one,\" he says,\n\"leaves this world in a different manner from one who has just been born.\"\nThat is not true; for we are worse when we die than when we were born;\nbut it is our fault, and not that of Nature.  Nature should scold\nus, saying: \"What does this mean?  I brought you into the world without\ndesires or fears, free from superstition, treachery and the other curses.\nGo forth as you were when you entered!\"\n<Ep1-157>\nEPISTLES XXII., XXIII.\nA man has caught the message of wisdom, if\nhe can die as free from care as he was at birth; but as it is we are all\na- flutter at the approach of the dreaded end.  Our courage fails\nus, our cheeks blanch; our tears fall, though they are unavailing.\nBut what is baser than to fret at the very threshold of peace?  The\nreason, however is, that we are stripped of all our goods, we have jettisoned\nour cargo of life and are in distress; for no part of it has been packed\nin the hold; it has all been heaved overboard and has drifted away.\nMen do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is\nwithin the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power\nto live long.  Farewell.\n~XXIII+ ON THE TRUE JOY WHICH COMES FROM\nPHILOSOPHY\nDo you suppose that I shall write you how kindly\nthe winter season has dealt with us, - a short season and a mild one, -\nor what a nasty spring we are having, - cold weather out of season, - and\nall the other trivialities which people write when they are at a loss for\ntopics of conversation?  No; I shall communicate something which may\nhelp both you and myself.  And what shall this \"something\" be, if\nnot an exhortation to soundness of mind?  Do you ask what is the foundation\nof a sound mind? It is, not to find joy in useless things.  I said\nthat it was the foundation; it is really the pinnacle.  We have reached\nthe heights if we know what it is that we find joy in and if we have not\nplaced our happiness in the control of externals.  The man who is\ngoaded ahead by hope of anything, though it be\n<Ep1-159>\nEPISTLE XXIII.\nwithin reach, though it be easy of access, and though his ambitions\nhave never played him false, is troubled and unsure of himself.  Above\nall, my dear Lucilius, make this your business: learn how to feel joy.\nDo you think that I am now robbing you of\nmany pleasures when I try to do away with the gifts of chance, when I counsel\nthe avoidance of hope, the sweetest thing that gladdens our hearts?\nQuite the contrary; I do not wish you ever to be deprived of gladness.\nI would have it born in your house; and it is born there, if only it be\ninside of you.  Otber objects of cheer do not fill a man's bosom;\nthey merely smooth his brow and are inconstant, - unless perhaps you believe\nthat he who laughs has joy.  The very soul must be happy and confident,\nlifted above every circumstance.\nReal joy, believe me, is a stern matter.\nCan one, do you think, despise death with a care-free countenance, or with\na \"blithe and gay\" expression, as our young dandies are accustomed to say?\nOr can one thus open his door to poverty, or hold the curb on his pleasures,\nor contemplate the endurance of pain?  He who ponders these things\nin his beart is indeed full of joy; but it is not a cheerful joy.\nIt is just this joy, however, of which I would have you become the owner;\nfor it will never fail you when once you have found its source.  The\nyield of poor mines is on the surface; those are really rich whose veins\nlurk deep, and they will make more bountiful returns to him who delves\nunceasingly.  So too those baubles which delight the common crowd\nafford but a thin pleasure, laid on as a coating, and even joy that is\nonly plated lacks a real basis.  But the joy of which I speak, that\nto which I am endeavouriiig to lead you, is something solid, dis-\n<Ep1-161>\nEPISTLE, XXIII.\nclosing itself the more fully as you penetrate into it.  Therefore\nI pray you, my dearest Lucilius, do the one thing that can render you really\nhappy: cast aside and trample under foot all the things that glitter outwardly\nand are held out to you a by another or as obtainable from another; look\ntoward the true good, and rejoice only in that which comes from your own\nstore.  And what do I mean by \"from your own store\"?  I mean\nfrom your very self, that which is the best part of you.  The frail\nbody, also, even though we can accomplish nothing without it, is to be\nregarded as necessary rather than as important; it involves us in vain\npleasures, short-lived, and soon to be regretted, which, unless they are\nreined in by extreme self-control, will be transformed into the opposite.\nThis is what I mean: pleasure, unless it has been kept within bounds, tends\nto rush headlong into the abyss of sorrow.\nBut it is hard to keep within bounds in that\nwhich you believe to be good.  The real good may be coveted with safety.\nDo you ask me what this real good is, and whence it derives?  I will\ntell you: it comes from a good conscience, from honourable purposes, from\nright actions, from contempt of the gifts of chance, from an even and calm\nway of living which treads but one path.  For men who leap from one\npurpose to another, or do not even leap but are carried over by a sort\nof hazard, - how can such wavering and unstable persons possess any good\nthat is fixed and lasting?  There are only a few who control themselves\nand their affairs by a guiding purpose; {PlainDealer+} {Hamlet+}\nthe rest do not proceed; they are merely swept along, like objects afloat\nin a river.  And of these objects, some are held back by sluggish\nwaters and\n<Ep1-163>\nEPISTLES XXIII., XXIV.\nare transported gently; others are torn along by a more violent current;\nsome, which are nearest the bank, are left there as the current slackens;\nand others are carried out to sea by the onrush of the stream.  Therefore,\nwe should decide what we wish, and abide by the decision.\nNow is the time for me to pay my debt.\nI can give you a saying of your friend Epicurus/a and thus clear this letter\nof its obligation. \"It is bothersome always to be beginning life.\" Or another,\nwhich will perhaps express the meaning better: \"They live ill who are always\nbeginning to live.\" You are right in asking why; the saying certainly stands\nin need of a commentary.  It is because the life of such persons is\nalways incomplete.  But a man cannot stand prepared for the approach\nof death if he has just begun to live.  We must make it our aim already\nto have lived long enough.  No one deems that he has done so, if he\nis just on the point of planning his life.  You need not think that\nthere are few of this kind; practically everyone is of such a stamp.\nSome men, indeed, only begin to live when it is time for them to leave\noff living.  And if this seems surpising to you, I shall add that\nwhich will surprise you still more:  Some men have left off living\nbefore they have begun.  Farewell.\n~XXIV+ ON DESPISING DEATH/b\nYou write me that you are anxious about the result\nof a lawsuit, with which an angry opponent is threatening you; and you\nexpect me to advise you to picture to yourself a happier issue, and to\nrest in the allurements of hope.  Why, indeed, is\n<Ep1-165>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\nit necessary to summon trouble, - which must be endured soon enough\nwhen it has once arrived, or to anticipate trouble and ruin the present\nthrough fear of the future?  It is indeed foolish to be unhappy now\nbecause you may be unhappy at some future time.  But I shall conduct\nyou to peace of mind by another route: if you would put off all worry,\nassume that what you fear may happen will certainly happen in any event;\nwhatever the trouble may be, measure it in your own mind, and estimate\nthe amount of your fear. You will thus understand that what you fear is\neither insignificant or shortlived.  And you need not spend a long\ntime in gathering illustrations which will strengthen you; every epoch\nhas produced them.  Let your thoughts travel into any era of Roman\nor foreign history, and there will throng before you notable examples of\nhigh achievement or of high endeavour.\nIf you lose this case, can anything more severe\nhappen to you than being sent into exile or led to prison?  Is there\na worse fate that any man may fear than being burned or being killed?\nName such penalties one by one, and mention the men who have scorned them;\none does not need to hunt for them, -it is simply a matter of selection.\nSentence of conviction was borne by Rutilius as if the injustice of the\ndecision were the only thing which annoyed him.  Exile was endured\nby Metellus with courage, by Rutilius even with gladness; for the former\nconsented to come back only because his country called him; the latter\nrefused to return when Sulla summoned him, - and nobody in those days said\n\"No\" to Sulla! Socrates in prison discoursed, and declined to flee when\ncertain persons gave him the opportunity; he remained there, in order to\nfree mankind from the\n<Ep1-167>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\nfear of two most grievous things, death and imprisonment.  Mucius\nput his hand into the fire.  It is painful to be burned; but how much\nmore painful to inflict such suffering upon oneself!  Here was a man\nof no learning, not primed to face death and pain by any words of wisdom,\nand equipped only with the courage of a soldier, who punished himself for\nhis fruitless daring; he stood and watched his own right hand falling away\npiecemeal on the enemy's brazier,/a nor did be withdraw the dissolving\nlimb, with its uncovered bones, until his foe removed the fire.  He\nmight have accomplished something more successful in that camp, but never\nanything more brave. See how much keener a brave man is to lay hold of\ndanger than a cruel man is to inflict it:  Porsenna was more ready\nto pardon Mucius for wishing to slay him than Mucius to pardon himself\nfor failing to slay Porsenna!\n\"Oh,\" say you, \"those stories have been droned\nto death in all the schools; pretty soon, when you reach the topic 'On\nDespising Death,' you will be telling me about Cato.\" But why should I\nnot tell you about Cato, how he read Plato's/b book on that last glorious\nnight, with a sword laid at his pillow?  He had provided these two\nrequisites for his last moments, - the first, that he might have the will\nto die, and the second, that be might have the means.  So he put his\naffairs in order, - as well as one could put in order that which was ruined\nand near its end, - and thought that he ought to see to it that no one\nshould have the power to slay or the good fortune to save/c Cato.\nDrawing the sword, - which he had kept unstained from all bloodshed against\nthe final day, he cried: \"Fortune+,\nyou have accomplished nothing by resisting all my endeavours.  I have\nfought, till\n<Ep1-169>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\nnow, for my country's freedom, and not for my own, I did not strive\nso doggedly to be free, but only to live among the free.  Now, since\nthe affairs of mankind are beyond hope, let Cato be withdrawn to safety.\"\nSo saying, he inflicted a mortal wound upon his body.  After the physicians\nhad bound it up, Cato had less blood and less strength, but no less courage;\nangered now not only at Caesar but also at himself, he rallied his unarmed\nhands against his wound, and expelled, rather than dismissed, that noble\nsoul which had been so defiant of all worldly power.\nI am not now heaping up these illustrations\nfor the purpose of exercising my wit, but for the purpose of encouraging\nyou to face that which is thought to be most terrible.  And I shall\nencourage you all the more easily by showing that not only resolute men\nhave despised that moment when the soul breathes its last, but that certain\npersons, who were craven in other respects, have equalled in this regard\nthe courage of the bravest.  Take, for example, Scipio, the father-in-law\nof Gnaeus Pompeius: he was driven back upon the African coast by a head-wind\nand saw his ship in the power of the enemy.  He therefore pierced\nhis body with a sword; and when they asked where the commander was, he\nreplicd: \"All is well with the commander.\" These words brought him up to\nthe level of his ancestors and suffered not the glory which fate gave to\nthe Scipios in Africa to lose its continuity.  It was a great deed\nto conquer Carthage, but a greater deed to conquer death. \"All is well\nwith the commander!\" Ought a general to die otherwise, especially one of\nCato's generals?  I shall not refer you to history, or collect examples\nof those men who throughout the ages have\n<Ep1-171>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\ndespised death; for they are very many.  Consider these times of\nours, whose enervation and overrefinement call forth our complaints; they\nnevertheless will include men of every rank, of every lot in life, and\nof every age, who have cut short their misfortunes by death.\nBelieve me, Lucilius; death is so little to\nbe feared that through its good offices nothing is to be feared.\nTherefore, when your enemy threatens, listen unconcernedly.  Although\nyour conscience makes you confident, yet, since many things have weight\nwhich are outside your case, both hope for that which is utterly just,\nand prepare yourself against that which is utterly unjust.  Remember,\nhowever, before all else, to strip things of all that disturbs and confuses,\nand to see what each is at bottom; you will then comprehend that they contain\nnothing fearful except the actual fear.  That you see happening to\nboys happens also to ourselves, who are only slightly bigger boys: when\nthose whom they love, with whom they daily associate, with whom they play,\nappear with masks on, the boys are frightened out of their wits.\nWe should strip the mask, not only from men, but from things, and restore\nto each object its own aspect.\n\"Why dost thou/b hold up before my eyes swords,\nfires, and a throng of executioners raging about thee?  Take away\nall that vain show, behind which thou lurkest and scarest fools!\nAh! thou art naught but Death+, {Donne+}\nwhom only yesterday a manservant of mine and a maid-servant did despise!\nWhy dost thou again unfold and spread before me, with all that great display,\nthe whip and the rack?  Why are those engines of torture made ready,\none for each several member of the body, and all the\n<Ep1-173>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\nother innumerable machines for tearing a man apart piecemeal?\nAway with all such stuff, which makes us numb with terror!  And thou,\nsilence the groans the cries, and the bitter shrieks ground out of the\nvictim as he is torn on the rack!  Forsooth thou are naught but Pain,\nscorned by yonder gout-ridden wretch, endured by yonder dyspeptic in the\nmidst of his dainties, borne bravely by the girl in travail.  Slight\nthou art, if I can bear thee; short thou art if I cannot bear thee!\"\nPonder these words which you have often heard\nand often uttered.  Moreover, prove by the result whether that which\nyou have heard and uttered is true.  For there is a very disgraceful\ncharge often brought against our school, - that we deal with the words,\nand not with the deeds, of philosophy.  What, have you only at this\nmoment learned that death is hanging over your head, at this moment exile,\nat this moment grief?  You were born to these perils.  Let us\nthink of everything that can happen as something which will happen. {Murphy+}\nI know that you have really done what I advise you to do; I now warn you\nnot to drown your soul in these petty anxieties of yours; if you do, the\nsoul will be dulled and will have too little vigour left when the time\ncomes for it to arise.  Remove the mind from this case of yours to\nthe case of men in general.  Say to yourself that our petty bodies\nare mortal and frail; pain can reach them from other sources than from\nwrong or the might of the stronger.  Our pleasures themselves become\ntorments; banquets bring indigestion, carousals paralysis of the muscles\nand palsy, sensual habits affect the feet, the hands, and every joint of\nthe body.\nI may become a poor man; I shall then be one\n<Ep1-175>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\namong many.  I may be exiled; I shall then regard myself as born\nin the place to which I shall be sent.  They may put me in chains.\nWhat then?  Am I free from bonds now?  Behold this clogging burden\nof a body, to which nature has fettered me! \"I shall die,\" you say; you\nmean to say \"I shall cease to run the risk of sickness; I shall cease to\nrun the risk of imprisonment; I shall cease to run the risk of death.\"\nI am not so foolish as to go through at this juncture the arguments which\nEpicurus harps upon, and say that the terrors of the world below are idle,\n- that Ixion does not whirl round on his wheel, that Sisyphus does not\nshoulder his stone uphill, that a man's entrails cannot be restored and\ndevoured every day;/a no one is so childish as to fear Cerberus, or the\nshadows, or the spectral garb of those who are held together by naught\nbut their unfleshed bones.  Death either annihilates us or strips\nus bare.  If we are then released, there remains the better part,\nafter the burden has been withdrawn; if we are annihilated, nothing remains;\ngood and bad are alike removed.\nAllow me at this point to quote a verse of\nyours, first suggesting that, when you wrote it, you meant it for yourself\nno less than for others.  It is ignoble to say one thing and mean\nanother; and how much more ignoble to write one thing and mean allother!\nI remember one day you were handling the well-known commonplace, - that\nwe do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees;\nwe die every day.  For every day a little of our life is taken from\nus; even when we are growing, our life is on the wane.  We lose our\nchildhood, then our boyhood, and then our youth.  Counting even yesterday,\nall past time is lost time; the very day\n<Ep1-177>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\nwhich we are now spending is shared between ourselves and death.\nIt is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that which\npreviously has flowed out; similarly, the final hour when we cease to exist\ndoes not of itself bring death; it merely of itself completes the death-process.\nWe reach death at that moment, but we have been a long time on the way.\nIn describing this situation, you said in your customary, style (for you\nare always impressive, but never more pungent than when you are putting\nthe truth in appropriate words):\nNot single is the death which comes; the death\nWhich takes us off is but the last of all.\nI prefer that you should read your own words rather than my letter; for\nthen it will be clear to you that this death, of which we are afraid, is\nthe last but not the only death     I see what you\nare looking for; you are asking what I have packed into my letter, what\ninspiriting saying from some master- mind, what useful precept.  So\nI shall send you something dealing with this very subject which has been\nunder discussion.  Epicurus/a upbraids those who crave, as much as\nthose who shrink from, death:  It is absurd,\" he says, \"to run towards\ndeath because you are tired of life, when it is your manner of life that\nhas made you run towards death.\" And in another passage:/b \"What is so\nabsurd as to seek death, when it is through fear of death that you have\nrobbed your life of peace?\" And you may add a third statement, of the same\nstamp:/c \"Men are so thoughtless, nay, so mad, that some, through fear\nof death, force themselves to die.\"     Whichever of\nthese ideas you ponder, you will strengthen your mind for the endurance\nalike of\n<Ep1-179>\nEPISTLE XXIV.\neath and of life.  For we need to be warned and strengthened in\nboth directions, - not to love or to hate life overmuch; even when reason\nadvises us to make an end of it, the impulse is not to be adopted without\nreflection or at headlong speed.  The grave and wise man should not\nbeat a hasty retreat from life; he should make a becoming exit.  And\nabove all, he should avoid the weakness which has taken possession of so\nmany, - the lust for death.{Hotspur+} For\njust as there is an unreflecting tendency of the mind towards other things,\nso, my dear Lucilius, there is an unreflecting tendency towards death;\nthis often seizes upon the noblest and most spirited men, as well as upon\nthe craven and the abject.  The former despise life; the latter find\nit irksome.\nOthers also are moved by a satiety of doing\nand seeing the same things, and not so much by a hatred of life as because\nthey are cloyed with it.  We slip into this condition, while philosophy\nitself pushes us on, and we say; \"How long must I endure the same things?\nShall I continue to wake and sleep, be hungry and be cloyed, shiver and\nperspire?  There is an end to nothing; all things are connected in\na sort of circle; they flee and they are pursued.  Night is close\nat the heels of day, day at the heels of night; summer ends in autumn,\nwinter rushes after autumn, and winter softens into spring; all nature\nin this way passes, only to return.  I do nothing new; I see nothing\nnew; sooner or later one sickens of this, also.\" There are many who think\nthat living is not painful, but superfluous.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-181>\nEPISTLE XXV,\n~XXV+ ON REFORMATION\nWith regard to these two friends of ours, we must proceed\nalong different lines; the faults of the one are to be corrected, the other's\nare to be crushed out.  I shall take every liberty; for I do not love\nthis one'/a if I am unwilling to hurt his feelings. \"What,\" you say, \"do\nyou expect to keep a forty-year- old ward under your tutelage?  Consider\nhis age, how hardened it now is, and past handling!  Such a man cannot\nbe re-shaped; only young minds are moulded.\" I do not know whether I shall\nmake progress; but I should prefer to lack success rather than to lack\nfaith.  You need not despair of curing sick men even when the disease\nis chronic, if only you hold out against excess and force them to do and\nsubmit to many things against their will.  As regards our other friend\nI am not sufficiently confident, either, except for the fact that he still\nhas sense of shame enough to blush for his sins.  This modesty should\nbe fostered; so long as it endures in his soul, there is some room for\nhope.  But as for this veteran of yours, I think we should deal more\ncarefully with him, that he may not become desperate about himself.\nThere is no better time to approach him than now, when he has an interval\nof rest and seems like one who has corrected his faults.  Others have\nbeen cheated by this interval of virtue on his part, but he does not cheat\nme.  I feel sure that these faults will return, as it were, with compound\ninterest, for just now, I am certain, they are in abeyance but not absent.\nI shall devote some time to the matter, and try to see whether or not something\ncan be done.\n<Ep1-183>\nEPISTLE, XXV.\nBut do you yourself, as indeed you are doing,\nshow me that you are stout-hearted; lighten your baggage for the march.\nNone of our possessions is essential.  Let us return to the law of\nnature; for then riches are laid up for us.  The things which we actually\nneed are free for all, or else cheap; nature craves only bread and water.\nNo one is poor according to this standard; when a man has limited his desires\nwithin these bounds, be can challenge the happiness of Jove himself, as\nEpicurus says.  I must insert in this letter one or two more of his\nsayings: \"Do everything as if Epicurus were watching you.\" There is no\nreal doubt that it is good for one to have appointed a guardian over oneself,\nand to have someone whom you may look up to, someone whom you may regard\nas a witness of your thoughts.  It is, indeed, nobler by far to live\nas you would live under the eyes of some good man, always at your side;\nbut nevertheless I am content if you only act, in whatever you do, as you\nwould act if anyone at all were looking on; because solitude prompts us\nto all kinds of evil. And when you have progressed so far that you have\nalso respect for yourself, you may send away your attendant; but until\nthen, set as a guard over yourself the authority of some man, whether your\nchoice be the great Cato or Scipio, or Laelius, - or any man in whose presence\neven abandoned wretches would check their bad inpulses.  Meantime,\nyou are engaged in making of yourself the sort of person in whose company\nyou would not dare to sin.  When this aim has been accomplished and\nyou begin to hold yourself in some esteem, I shall gradually allow you\nto do what Epicurus, in another passage, suggests:/b \"The time when you\nshould most of all withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be\nin a crowd.\"\n<Ep1-185>\nEPISTLES XXV., XXVI.\nYou ought to make yourself of a different stamp\nfrom the multitude.  Therefore, while it is not yet safe to withdraw\ninto solitude,/a seek out certain individuals; for everyone is better off\nin the company of somebody or other, - no matter who, - than in his own\ncompany alone. \"The time when you should most of all withdraw into yourself\nis when you are forced to be in a crowd.\" Yes, provided that you are a\ngood, tranquil, and self-restrained man; otherwise, you had better withdraw\ninto a crowd in order to get away from your self.  Alone, you are\ntoo close to a rascal.  Farewell.\n~XXVI+ ON OLD AGE AND DEATH\nI was just lately telling you that I was within sight\nof old age./b I am now afraid that I have left old age behind me.\nFor some other word would now apply to my years, or at any rate to my body;\nsince old age means a time of life that is weary rather than crushed.\nYou may rate me in the worn-out class, - of those who are nearing the end.\nNevertheless, I offer thanks to myself, with\nyou as witness; for I feel that age has done no damage to my mind, though\nI feel its effects on my constitution.  Only my vices, and the outward\naids to these vices, have reached senility; my mind is strong and rejoices\nthat it has but slight connexion with the body.  It has laid aside\nthe greater part of its load.  It is alert; it takes issue with me\non the subject of old age; it declares that old age is its time of bloom.\nLet me take it at its word, and let it make the most of the advantages\nit possesses.  The mind bids me do some thinking and consider how\nmuch of this\n<Ep1-187>\nEPISTLE XXVI.\npeace of spirit and moderation of character I owe to wisdom and how\nmuch to my time of life; it bids me distinguish carefully what I cannot\ndo and what I do not want to do. . . .  For why should one complain\nor regard it as a disadvantage, if powers which ought to come to an end\nhave failed? \"But,\" you say, \"it is the greatest possible disadvantage\nto be worn out and to die off, or rather, if I may speak literally, to\nmelt away!  For we are not suddenly smitten and laid low; we are worn\naway, and every day reduces our powers to a certain extent.\"\nBut is there any better end to it all than\nto glide off to one's proper haven, when nature slips the cable?\nNot that there is anything painful in a shock and a sudden departure from\nexistence; it is merely because this other way of departure is easy, -\na gradual withdrawal. I, at any rate, as if the test were at hand and the\nday were come which is to pronounce its decision concerning all the years\nof my life, watch over myself and commune thus with myself: \"The showing\nwhich we have made up to the present time, in word or deed, counts for\nnothing.  All this is but a trifling and deceitful pledge of our spirit,\nand is wrapped in much charlatanism.  I shall leave it to Death to\ndetermine what progress I have made.  Therefore with no faint heart\nI am making ready for the day when, putting aside all stage artifice and\nactor's rouge, I am to pass judgment upon myself, - whether I am merely\ndeclaiming brave sentiments, or whether I really feel them; whether all\nthe bold threats I have uttered against fortune are a pretence and a farce.\nPut aside the opinion of the world; it is always wavering and always takes\nboth sides.  Put aside the studies which you have pursued throughout\nyour life;\n<Ep1-189>\nEPISTLE XXVI.\nDeath will deliver the final judgment in your case.  This is what\nI mean: your debates and learned talks, your maxims gathered from the teachings\nof the wise, your cultured conversation, - all these afford no proof of\nthe real strength of your soul.  Even the most timid man can deliver\na bold speech.  What you have done in the past will be manifest only\nat the time when you draw your last breath.  I accept the terms; I\ndo not shrink from the decision.\" This is what I say to myself, but I would\nhave you think that I have said it to you also.  You are younger;\nbut what does that matter? There is no fixed count of our years.\nYou do not know where death awaits you; so be ready for it everywhere.\nI was just intending to stop, and my hand\nwas making ready for the closing sentence; but the rites are still to be\nperformed and the travelling money for the letter disbursed.  And\njust assume that I am not telling where I intend to borrow the necessary\nsum; you know upon whose coffers I depend.  Wait for me but a moment,\nand I will pay you from my own account;/a meanwhile, Epicurus will oblige\nme with these words:/b, \"Think on death,\" or rather, if you prefer the\nphrase, on \"migration to heaven.\" The meaning is clear, - that it is a\nwonderful thing to learn thoroughly how to die.  You may deem it superfluous\nto learn a text that can be used only once; but that is just the reason\nwhy we ought to think on a thing.  When we can never prove whether\nwe really know a thing, we must always be learning it. \"Think on death.\"\nIn saying this, he bids us think on freedom.  He who has learned to\ndie has unlearned slavery; he is above any external power, or, at any rate,\nhe is beyond it.  What terrors have prisons and bonds and bars for\nhim?  His way\n<Ep1-191>\nEPISTLES XXVI., XXVII.\nout is clear.  There is only one chain which binds us to life,\nand that is the love of life.  The chain may not be cast off, but\nit may be rubbed away,, so that, when necessity shall demand, nothing may\nretard or hinder us from being ready to do at once that which at some time\nwe are bound to do.  Farewell.\n~XXVII+ ON THE GOOD WHICH ABIDES\n\"What,\" say you, \"are you giving me advice?\nIndeed, have you already advised yourself, already corrected your own faults?\nIs this the reason why you have leisure to reform ether men?\" No, I am\nnot so shameless as to undertake to cure my fellow-men when I am ill myself.\nI am, however, discussing with you troubles which concern us both, and\nsharing the remedy with you, just as if we were lying ill in the same hospital.\nListen to me, therefore, as you would if I were talking to myself.\nI am admitting you to my inmost thoughts, and am having it out with myself,\nmerely making use of you as my pretext.  I keep crying out to myself:\n\"Count your years, and you will be ashamed to desire and pursue the same\nthings you desired in your boyhood days.  Of this one thing make sure\nagainst your dying day, - let your faults die before you die.  Away\nwith those disordered pleasures, which must be dearly paid for; it is not\nonly those which are to come that harm me, but also those which have come\nand gone.  Just as crimes, even if they have not been detected when\nthey were committed, do not allow anxiety to end with them; so with guilty\npleasures, regret remains even after the pleasures are over.  They\nare not substantial, they are not trustworthy; even if they\n<Ep1-193>\nEPISTLE XXVII.\ndo not harm us, they are fleeting.  Cast about rather for some\ngood which will abide.  But there can be no such good except as the\nsoul discovers it for itself within itself.  Virtue alone affords\neverlasting and peace-giving joy; even if some obstacle arise, it is but\nlike an intervening cloud, which floats beneath the sun but never prevails\nagainst it.\" When will it be your lot to attain this joy?  Thus far,\nyou have indeed not been sluggish, but you must quicken your pace.\nMuch toil remains; to confront it, you must yourself lavish all your waking\nhours, and all your efforts, if you wish the result to be accomplished.\nThis matter cannot be delegated to someone else.  The other kind of\nliterary activity/a admits of outside assistance. Within our own time there\nwas a certain rich man named Calvisius Sabinus; he had the bank-account\nand the brains of a freedman./b I never saw a man whose good fortune was\na greater offence against propriety.  His memory was so faulty that\nhe would sometimes forget the name of Ulysses, or Achilles, or Priam, -\nnames which we know as well as we know those of our own attendants. No\nmajor-domo in his dotage, who cannot give men their right names, but is\ncompelled to invent names for them, - no such man, I say, calls off the\nnames/c of his master's tribesmen so atrociously as Sabinus used to call\noff the Trojan and Achaean heroes.  But none the less did he desire\nto appear learned.  So he devised this short cut to learning: he paid\nfabulous prices for slaves, - one to know Homer by heart and another to\nknow Hesiod; he also delegated a special slave to each of the nine lyric\npoets.  You need not wonder that he paid high prices for these slaves;\nif he did not find them ready to hand he had them made to order.\nAfter collecting this retinue,\n<Ep1-195>\nEPISTLE XXVII.\nbe began to make life miserable for his guests; he would keep these\nfellows at the foot of his couch, and ask them from time to time for verses\nwhich he might repeat, and then frequently break down in the middle of\na word.  Satellius Quadratus, a feeder, and consequently a fawner,\nupon addle-pated millionaires, and also (for this quality goes with the\nother two) a flouter of them, suggested to Sabinus that he should have\nphilologists to gather up the bits.  Sabinus remarked that each slave\ncost him one hundred thousand sesterces; Satellius replied: \"You might\nhave bought as many book-cases for a smaller sum.\" But Sabinus held to\nthe opinion that what any member of his household knew, he himself knew\nalso.  This same Satellius began to advise Sabinus to take wresthng\nlessons, - sickly, pale, and thin as he was, Sabinus answered: \"How can\nI?  I can scarcely stay alive now.\" \"Don't say that, I implore you,\"\nreplied the other, \"consider how many perfectly healthy slaves you have!\"\nNo man is able to borrow or buy a sound mind; in fact, as it seems to me,\neven though sound minds were for sale, they would not find buyers.\nDepraved minds, however, are bought and sold every day.\nBut let me pay off my debt and say farewell:\n\"Real wealth is poverty adjusted to the law of Nature.\" Epicurus has this\nsaying in various ways and contexts; but it can never be repeated too often,\nsince it can never be learned too well.  For some persons the remedy\nshould be merely prescribed; in the case of others, it should be forced\ndown their throats.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-197>\nEPISTLE XXVIII.\n~XXVIII+ ON TRAVEL AS A  CURE FOR\nDISCONTENT\nDo you suppose that you alone have had this experience?\nAre you surprised, as if it were a novelty, that after such long travel\nand so many changes of scene you have not been able to shake off the gloom\nand heaviness of your mind?  You need a change of soul rather than\na change of climate./a Though you may cross vast spaces of sea, and though,\nas our Vergil/b remarks,\nLands and cities are left astern,\nyour faults will follow you whithersoever you travel. {Thoreau+?}\nSocrates made the same remark to one who complained; he said: \"Why do you\nwonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you always take\nyourself with you?  The reason which set you wandering is ever at\nyour heels.\" What pleasure is there in seeing new lands?  Or in surveying\ncities and spots of interest?  All your bustle is useless.  Do\nyou ask why such flight does not help you?  It is because you flee\nalong with yourself.  You must lay aside the burdens of the mind;\nuntil you do this, no place will satisfy you.  Reflect that your present\nbehaviour is like that of the prophetess whom Vergil describes:/c she is\nexcited and goaded into fury, and contains within herself much inspiration\nthat is not her own:  The priestess raves, if haply she may shake\nThe great god from her heart.  You wander hither and yon, to rid yourself\nof the\n<Ep1-199>\nEPISTLE  XXVIII\nburden that rests upon you, though it becomes more troublesome by reason\nof your very restlessness, just as in a ship the cargo when stationary\nmakes no trouble, but when it shifts to this side or that, it causes the\nvessel to heel more quickly in the direction where it has settled.\nAnything you do tells against you, and you hurt yourself by your very unrest;\nfor you are shaking up a sick man.\nThat trouble once removed, all change of scene\nwill become pleasant; though you may be driven to the uttermost ends of\nthe earth, in whatever corner of a savage land you may find yourself, that\nplace, however forbidding, will be to you a hospitable abode.  The\nperson you are matters more than the place to which you go; for that reason\nwe should not make the mind a bondsman to any one place.  Live in\nthis belief: \"I am not born for any one corner of the universe; this whole\nworld is my country.\" If you saw this fact clearly, you would not be surprised\nat getting no benefit from the fresh scenes to which you roam each time\nthrough weariness of the old scenes.  For the first would have pleased\nyou in each case, had you believed it wholly yours./a As it is, however,\nyou are not journeying; you are drifting and being driven, only exchanging\none place for another, although that which you seek, - to live well, -\nis found everywhere./b Can there be any spot so full of confusion as the\nForum?  Yet you can live quietly even there, if necessary.  Of\ncourse, if one were allowed to make one's own arrangements, I should flee\nfar from the very sight and neighbourhood of the Forum.  For just\nas pestilential places assail even the strongest constitution, so there\nare some places which are also unwholesome for a healthy mind which is\nnot yet quite sound, though recover-\n<Ep1-201>\nEPISTLES XXVIII., XXIX.\ning from its ailment.  I disagree with those who strike out into\nthe midst of the billows and, welcoming a stormy existence, wrestle daily\nin hardihood of soul with life's problems.  The wise man will endure\nall that, but will not choose it; he will prefer to be at peace rather\nthan at war. It helps little to have cast out your own faults if you must\nquarrel with those of others.  Says one: \"There were thirty tyrants\nsurrounding Socrates, and yet they could not break his spirit\"; but what\ndoes it matter how many masters a man has? \"Slavery\" has no plural; and\nhe who has scorned it is free, - no matter amid how large a mob of over-lords\nhe stands.\nIt is time to stop, but not before I have\npaid duty. \"The knowledge of sin is the beginning of salvation.\" {humility+}\nThis saying of Epicurus/a seems to me to be a noble one.  For he who\ndoes not know that he has sinned does not desire correction; you must discover\nyourself in the wrong before you can reform yourself.  Some boast\nof their faults.  Do you think that the man has any thought of mending\nhis ways who counts over his vices as if they were virtues?  Therefore,\nas far as possible, prove yourself guilty, hunt up charges against yourself;\nplay the part, first of accuser, then of judge, last of intercessor.\nAt times be harsh with yourself./b Farewell.\n~XXIX+ ON THE CRITICAL CNIDITION OF MARCELLEINUS\nYou have been inquiring about our friend Marcellinus\nand you desire to know how he is getting along.  He seldom comes to\nsee me, for no other reason than that he is afraid to hear the truth, and\nat present he\n<Ep1-203>\nEPISTLE XXIX.\nis removed from my danger of hearing it; for one must not talk to a\nman unless he is willing to listen.  That is why it is often doubted\nwhether Diogenes and the other Cynics, who employed an undiscriminating\nfreedom of speech and offered advice to any who came in their way, ought\nto have pursued such a plan.  For what if one should chide the deaf\nor those who are speechless from birth or by illness?  But you answer:\nWhy should I spare words?  They cost nothing.  I cannot know\nwhether I shall help the man to whom I give advice; but I know well that\nI shall help someone if I advise many.  I must scatter this advice\nby the handful./a It is impossible that one who tries often should not\nsometime succeed.\"\nThis very thing, my dear Lucilius, is, I believe,\nexactly what a great-souled man ought not to do; his influence is weakened;\nit has too little effect upon those whom it might have set right if it\nhad not grown so stale.  The archer ought not to hit the mark only\nsometimes; be ought to miss it only sometimes.  That which takes effect\nby chance is not an art.  Now wisdom is an art; it should have a definite\naim, choosing only those who will make progress, but withdrawing from those\nwhom it has come to regard as hopeless, -yet not abandoning them too soon,\nand just when the case is becoming hopeless trying drastic remedies.\nAs to our friend Marcellinus, I have not yet\nlost hope.  He can still be saved, but the helping hand must be offered\nsoon.  There is indeed danger that be may pull his helper down; for\nthere is in him a native character of great vigour, though it is already\ninclining to wickedness.  Nevertheless I shall brave this danger and\nbe bold enough to show him his\n<Ep1-205>\nEPISTLE XXIX.\nfaults.  He will act in his usual way; he will have recourse to\nhis wit, - the wit that can call forth smiles even from mourners.\nHe will turn the jest, first against himself, and then against me.\nHe will forestall every word which I am about to utter.  He will quiz\nour philosopbic systems; he will accuse philosophers of accepting doles,\nkeeping mistresses, and indulging their appetites.  He will point\nout to me one philosopher who has been caught in adultery, another who\nhaunts the cafes, and another who appears at court. He will bring to my\nnotice Aristo, the philosopher of Marcus Lepidus, who used to hold discussions\nin his carriage; for that was the time which he had taken for editing his\nresearches, so that Scaurus said of him when asked to what school he belonged:\n\"At any rate, he isn't one of the Walking Philosophers.\" Julius Graecinus,\ntoo, a man of distinction, when asked for an opinion on the same point,\nreplied: \"I cannot tell you; for I don't know what he does when dismounted,\"\nas if the query referred to a chariot-gladiator./a It is mountebanks of\nthat sort, for whom it would be more creditable to have left philosophy\nalone than to traffic in her, whom Marcellinus will throw in my teeth.\nBut I have decided to put up with taunts; he may stir my laughter, but\nI perchance shall stir him to tears; or, if he persist in his jokes, I\nshall rejoice, so to speak, in the midst of sorrow, because he is blessed\nwith such a merry sort of lunacy.  But that kind of merriment does\nnot last long.  Observe such men, and you will note that within a\nshort space of time they laugh to excess and rage to excess.  It is\nmy plan to approach him and to show him how much greater was his worth\nwhen many thought it less.  Even though I shall not root out his faults,\nI shall\n<Ep1-207>\nEPISTLE XXIX.\nput a check upon them; they will not cease, but they will stop for a\ntime; and perhaps they will even cease, if they get the habit of stopping.\nThis is a thing not to be despised, since to men who are seriously stricken\nthe blessing of relief is a substitute for health.  So while I prepare\nmyself to deal with Marcellinus, do you in the meantime, who are able,\nand who understand whence and whither you have made your way, and who for\nthat reason have an inkling of the distance yet to go, regulate your character,\nrouse your courage, and stand firm in the face of things which have terrified\nyou.  Do not count the number of those who inspire fear in you.\nWould you not regard as foolish one who was afraid of a multitude in a\nplace where only one at a time could pass?  Just so, there are not\nmany who have access to you to slay you, though there are many who threaten\nyou with death. Nature has so ordered it that, as only one has given you\nlife, so only one will take it away.\nIf you had any shame, you would have let me\noff from paying the last instalment.  Still, I shall not be niggardly\neither, but shall discharge my debts to the last penny and force upon you\nwhat I still owe: \"I have never wished to cater to the crowd; for what\nI know, they do not approve, and what they approve, I do not know.\"/a \"Who\nsaid this?\" you ask, as if you were ignorant whom I am pressing into service;\nit is Epicurus.  But this same watchword rings in your ears from every\nsect, - Peripatetic, Academic, Stoic, Cynic.  For who that is pleased\nby virtue can please the crowd?  It takes trickery to win popular\napproval; and you must needs make yourself like unto th\n<Ep1-209>\nEPISTLES XXIX., XXX.\nthemgelves.  However, what you think of yourself is much more to\nthe point than what others think of you.  The favour of ignoble men\ncan be won only by ignoble means.  What benefit, then, will that vaunted\nphilosophy confer, whose praises we sing, and which, we are told, is to\nbe preferred to every art and every possession?  Assuredly, it will\nmake you prefer to please yourself rather than the\npopulace+, it will make you weigh, and not merely count, men's judgments,\nit will make you live without fear of gods or men, it will make you either\novercome evils or end them.  Otherwise, if I see you applauded by\npopular acclamation, if your entrance upon the scene is greeted by a roar\nof cheering and clapping, marks of distinction meet only for actors, -\nif the whole state, even the women and children, sing your praises, how\ncan I help pitying you?  For I know what pathway leads to such popularity.\nFarewell.\n~XXX+ ON CONQUERING THE CONQUEROR\nI have beheld Aufidius Bassus, that noble man,\nshattered in health and wrestling with his years.  But they already\nbear upon him so heavily that he cannot be raised up; old age has settled\ndown upon him with great, - yes, with its entire, weight.  You know\nthat his body was always delicate and sapless.  For a long time he\nhas kept it in hand, or, to speak more correctly, has kept it together;\nof a sudden it has collapsed.  Just as in a ship that springs a leak,\nyou can always stop the first or the second fissure, but when many holes\nbegin to\n<Ep1-211>\nEPISTLE XXX.\nin an old man's body, there is a certain limit up to which you can sustain\nand prop its weakness.  But when it comes to resemble a decrepit building,\nwhen every joint begins to spread and while one is being repaired another\nfalls apart, - then it is time for a man to look about him and consider\nhow he may get out./a\nBut the mind of our friend Bassus is active.\nPhilosophy bestows this boon upon us; it makes us joyful in the very sight\nof death, strong and brave no matter in what state the body may be, cheerful\nand never failing though the body fail us.  A great pilot can sail\neven when his canvas is rent; if his ship be dismantled, he can yet put\nin trim what remains of her hull and hold her to her course.  This\nis what our friend Bassus is doing; and he contemplates his own end with\nthe courage and countenance which you would regard as undue indifference\nin a man who so contemplated another's.\nThis is a great accomplishment, Lucilius,\nand one which needs long practice to learn, - to depart calmly when the\ninevitable hour arrives.  Other kinds of death contain an ingredient\nof hope: a disease comes to an end; a fire is quenched; falling houses\nhave set down in safety those whom they seemed certain to crush; the sea\nhas cast ashore unharmed those whom it had engulfed, by the same force\nthrough which it drew them down; the soldier has drawn back his sword from\nthe very neck of his doomed foe.  But those whom old age is leading\naway to death have nothing to hope for; old age alone grants no reprieve.\nNo ending, to be sure, is more painless; but there is none more lingering.\nOur friend Bassus seemed to me to be attending\nhis own funeral, and laying out his own body for\n<Ep1-213>\nEPISTLE XXX\nburial, and living almost as if he had survived his own death, and bearing\nwith wise resignation his grief at his own departure.  For he talks\nfreely about death, trying hard to persuade us that if this process contains\nany element of discomfort or of fear, it is the fault of the dying person,\nand not of death itself; also, that there is no more inconvenience at the\nactual moment than there is after it is over. \"And it is just as insane,\"\nhe adds, \"for a man to fear what will not happen to him. as to fear what\nhe will not feel if it does happen.\" Or does anyone imagine it to be possible\nthat the agency by which feeling is removed can be itself felt? \"Therefore,\"\nsays Bassus, \"death stands so far beyond all evil that it is beyond all\nfear of evils.\"\nI know that all this has often been said and\nshould be often repeated; but neither when I read them were such precepts\nso effective with me, nor when I heard them from the lips of those who\nwere at a safe distance from the fear of the things which they declared\nwere not to be feared.  But this old man had the greatest weight with\nme when he discussed death and death was near.  For I must tell you\nwhat I myself think:  I hold that one is braver at the very moment\nof death than when one is approaching death.  For death, when it stands\nnear us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid\nthe inevitable. So the gladiator, who throughout the fight has been no\nmatter how fainthearted, offers his throat to his opponent and directs\nthe wavering blade to the vital spot./a But an end that is near at hand,\nand is bound to come, calls for tenacious courage of soul; this is a rarer\nthing, and none but the wise man can manifest it.\nAccordingly, I listened to Bassus with the\ndeepest\n<Ep1-215>\nEPISTLE XXX.\npleasure; he was casting his vote concerning death and pointing out\nwhat sort of a thing it is when it is observed, so to speak, nearer at\nhand.  I suppose that a man would have your confidence in a larger\ndegree, and would have more weight with you, if he had come hack to life\nand should declare from experience that there is no evil in death; and\nso, regarding the approach of death, those will tell you best what disquiet\nit brings who have stood in its path, who have seen it coming and have\nwelcomed it. Bassus may be included among these men; and he had no wish\nto deceive us. He says that it is as foolish to fear death as to fear old\nage; for death follows old age precisely as old age follows youth.\nHe who does not wish to die cannot have wished to live.  For life\nis granted to us with the reservation that we shall die; to this end our\npath leads.  Therefore, how foolish it is to fear it, since men simply\nawait that which is sure, but fear only that which is uncertain!\nDeath has its fixed rule, - equitable and unavoidable. Who can complain\nwhen he is governed by terms which include everyone?  The chief part\nof equity, however, is equality.\nBut it is superfluous at the present time\nto plead Nature's cause; for she wishes our laws to be identical with her\nown; she but resolves that which she has compounded, and compounds again\nthat which she has resolved.  Moreover, if it falls to the lot of\nany man to be set gently adrift by old age, - not suddenly torn from life,\nbut withdrawn bit by bit, oh, verily he should thank the gods, one and\nall, because, after be has had his fill, he is removed to a rest which\nis ordained for mankind, a rest that is welcome to the weary.  You\nmay observe\n<Ep1-217>\nEPISTLE XXX.\ncertain men who crave death even more earnestly than others are wont\nto beg for life.  And I do not know which men give us greater courage,\n- those who call for death, or those who meet it cheerfully and tranquilly,\n- for the first attitude is sometimes inspired by madness and sudden anger,\nthe second is the calm which results from fixed judgment.  Before\nnow men have gone to meet death in a fit of rage; but when death comes\nto meet him, no one welcomes it cheerfully, except the man who has long\nsince composed himself for death.  I admit, therefore, that I have\nvisited this dear friend of mine more frequently on many pretexts, but\nwith the purpose of learning whether I should find him always the same,\nand whether his mental strength was perhaps waning in company with his\nhodily powers.  But it was on the increase, just as the joy of the\ncharioteer is wont to show itself more clearly when he is on the seventh\nround/a of the course, and nears the prize.  Indeed, he often said,\nin accord with the counsels of Epicurus/b: \"I hope, first of all, that\nthere is no pain at the moment when a man breathes his last; but if there\nis, one will find an element of comfort in its very shortness.  For\nno great pain lasts long.  And at all events, a man will find relief\nat the very time when soul and body are being torn asunder, even though\nthe process be accompanied by excruciating pain, in the thought that after\nthis pain is over he can feel no more pain.  I am sure, however, that\nan old man's soul is on his very lips, and that only a little force is\nnecessary to disengage it from the body.  A fire which has seized\nupon a substance that sustains it needs water to quench it, or, sometimes,\nthe destruction of the building itself; but the fire\n<Ep1-219>\nEPISTLE XXX.\nwhich lacks sustaining fuel dies away of its own accord.\"\nI am glad to hear such words, my dear Lucilius,\nnot as new to me, but as leading me into the presence of an actual fact.\nAnd what then?  Have I not seen many men break the thread of life?\nI have indeed seen such men; but those have more weight with me who approach\ndeath without any loathing for life, letting death in, so to speak, and\nnot pulling it towards them.  Bassus kept saying: \"It is due to our\nown fault that we feel this torture, because we shrink from dying only\nwhen we believe that our end is near at hand.\" But who is not near death?\nIt is ready for us in all places and at all times. \"Let us consider,\" he\nwent on to say, \"when some agency of death seems imminent, how much nearer\nare other varieties of dying which are not feared by us.\" A man is threatened\nwith death by an enemy, but this form of death is anticipated by an attack\nof indigestion. And if we are willing to examine critically the various\ncauses of our fear, we shall find that some exist, and others only seem\nto be.  We do not fear death; we fear the thought of death.\nFor death itself is always the same distance from us; wherefore, if it\nis to be feared at all, it is to be feared always.  For what season\nof our life is exempt from death?\nBut what I really ought to fear is that you\nwill hate this long letter worse than death itself; so I shall stop.\nDo you, however, always think on death in order that you may never fear\nit. Farewell.\n<Ep1-221>\nEPISTLE XXXI.\n~XXXI+ ON SIREN SONGS\nNow I recognize my Lucilius!  He is beginning to reveal\nthe character of which he gave promise.  Follow up the impulse which\nprompted you to make for all that is best, treading under your feet that\nwhich is approved by the crowd.  I would not have you greater or better\nthan you planned; for in your case the mere foundations have covered a\nlarge extent of ground; only finish all that you have laid out, and take\nin hand the plans which you have had in mind.  In short, you will\nbe a wise man, if you stop up your ears; nor is it enough to close them\nwith wax; you need a denser stopple than that which they say Ulysses used\nfor his comrades. The song which he feared was alluring, but came not from\nevery side; the song, however, which you have to fear, echoes round you\nnot from a single headland, but from every quarter of the world.\nSail, therefore, not past one region which you mistrust because of its\ntreacherous delights, but past every city.  Be deaf to those who love\nyou most of all; they pray for bad things with good intentions.  And,\nif you would be happy, entreat the gods that none of their fond desires\nfor you may be brought to pass.  What they wish to have beeped upon\nyou are not really good things; there is only one good, the cause and the\nsupport of a happy life, -trust in oneself. But this cannot be attained,\nunless one has learned to despise toil and to reckon it among the things\nwhich are neither good nor bad.  For it is not possible that a single\nthing should be bad at one time and good at another, at times light and\nto be endured, and at times a cause of dread. Work is not a good./a Then\nwhat is\n<Ep1-223>\nEPISTLE XXXI.\na good?  I say, the scorning of\nwork+.  That is why I should rebuke men who toil to no purpose.\nBut when, on the other hand, a man is struggling towards honourable things,\nin proportion as he applies himself more and more, and allows himself less\nand less to be beaten or to halt,/a I shall recommend his conduct and shout\nmy encouragement, saying: \"By so much you are better!  Rise, draw\na fresh breath, and surmount that hill, if possible, at a single spurt!\"\nWork is the sustenance of noble minds. {Conrad+}\nThere is, then, no reason why, in accordance with that old vow of your\nparents, you should pick and choose what fortune you wish should fall to\nyour lot, or what you should pray for; besides, it is base for a man who\nhas already travelled the whole round of highest honours to be still importuning\nthe gods.  What need is there of vows?  Make yourself happy through\nyour own efforts; you can do this, if once you comprehend that whatever\nis blended with virtue is good, and that whatever is joined to vice is\nbad.  Just as nothing gleams if it has no light blended with it, and\nnothing is black unless it contains darkness or draws to itself something\nof dimness, and as nothing is hot without the aid of fire, and nothing\ncold without air; so it is the association of virtue and vice that makes\nthings honourable or base.\nWhat then is good?  The knowledge of\nthings. What is evil?  The lack of knowledge of things.  Your\nwise man, who is also a craftsman, will reject or choose in each case as\nit suits the occasion; but he does not fear that which he rejects, nor\ndoes he admire that which he chooses, if only he has a stout and unconquerable\nsoul.  I forbid you to be cast down or depressed.  It is not\nenough if you do not\n<Ep1-225>\nEPISTLE XXXI.\nshrink from work+; ask for it. \"But,\" you\nsay, \"is not trifling and superfluous work, and work that has been inspired\nby ignoble causes, a bad sort of work?\" No; no more than that which is\nexpended upon noble endeavours, since the very quality that endures toil\nand rouses itself to hard and uphill effort, is of the spirit, which says:\n\"Why do you grow slack?  It is not the part of a man to fear sweat.\"\nAnd besides this, in order that virtue may be perfect, there should be\nan even temperament and a scheme of life that is consistent with itself\nthroughout; and this result cannot be attained without knowledge of things,\nand without the art/a which enables us to understand things human and things\ndivine.  That is the greatest good. If you seize this good, you begin\nto be the associate of the gods, and not their suppliant. \" But how,\" you\nask, \"does one attain that goal?  You do not need to cross the Pennine\nor Graian/b hills, or traverse the Candavian/c waste, or face the Syrtes,/d\nor Scylla, or Charybdis, although you have travelled through all these\nplaces for the bribe of a petty governorship; the journey for which nature\nhas equipped you is safe and pleasant.  She has given you such gifts\nthat you may, if you do not prove false to them, rise level with God.\nYour money, however, will not place you on a level with God; for God has\nno property.  Your bordered robe/e will not do this; for God is not\nclad in raiment; nor will your reputation+,\nnor a display of self, nor a knowledge of your name wide-spread throughout\nthe world; for no one has knowledge of God; many even hold him in low esteem,\nand do not suffer for so doing.  The throng of slaves which carries\nyour litter along the city streets and in foreign places\n<Ep1-227>\nEPISTLES XXXI., XXXII.\nwill not help you; for this God of whom I speak, though the highest\nand most powerful of beings, carries all things on his own shoulders.\nNeither can beauty or strength make you blessed, for none of these qualities\ncan withstand old age.\nWhat we have to seek for, then, is that which\ndoes not each day pass more and more under the control of some power which\ncannot be withstood./a And what is this?  It is the soul, - but the\nsoul that is upright, good, and great.  What else could you call such\na soul than a god dwelling as a guest in a human body?  A soul like\nthis may descend into a Roman knight just as well as into a freedman's\nson or a slave.  For what is a Roman knight, or a freedmen's son,\nor a slave?  They are meretitles+, born\nof ambition or of wrong.  One may leap to heaven from the very slums.\nOnly rise\nAnd mould thyself to kinship with thy God./b\nThis moulding will not be done in gold or silver;\nan image that is to be in the likeness of God cannot be fashioned of such\nmaterials; remember that the gods, when they were kind unto men,/c were\nmoulded in clay.  Farewell.\n~XXXII+ ON PROGRESS\nI have been asking about you, and inquiring of everyone\nwho comes from your part of the country, what you are doing, and where\nyou are spending your time, and with whom.  You cannot deceive me;\nfor I am with you.  Live just as if I were sure to get news of your\ndoings, nay, as if I were sure to behold them.  An\n<Ep1-229>\nEPISTLE XXXII.\nme that I hear concerning you, it is that I hear nothing, that most\nof those whom I ask do not know what you are doing.\nThis is sound practice - to refrain from associating\nwith men of different stamp and difrerent aims.  And I am indeed confident\nthat you cannot be warped, that you will stick to your purpose, even though\nthe crowd may surround and seek to distract you.  What, then,is on\nmy mind? I am not afraid lest they work a change in you; but I am afraid\nlest they may hinder your progress.  And much harm is done even by\none who holds you back, especially since life is so short; and we make\nit still shorter by our unsteadiness, by making ever fresh beginnings at\nlife, now one and immediately another.  We break up life into little\nbits, and fritter it away.  Hasten ahead, then, dearest Lucilius,\nand reflect how greatly you would quicken your speed if an enemy were at\nyour back, or if you suspected the cavalry were approaching and pressing\nhard upon your steps as you fled. It is true; the enemy is indeed pressing\nupon you; you should therefore increase your speed and escape away and\nreach a safe position, remembering continualIy what a noble thing it is\nto round out your life before death comes, and then await in peace the\nremaining portion of your time, claiming/a nothing for yourself, since\nyou are in possession of the happy life; for such a life is not made happier\nfor being longer.  O when shall you see the time when you shall know\nthat time means nothing to you, when you shall be peaceful and calm, careless\nof the morrow, because you are enjoying your life to the full?\nWould you know what makes men greedy for the\nfuture?  It is because no one has yet found himself.\n<Ep1-231>\nEPISTLES XXXII., XXXIII.\nYour parents, to be sure, asked other blessings for you; but I myself\npray rather that you may despise all those things which your parents wished\nfor you in abundance.  Their prayers plunder many another person,\nsimply that you may be enriched.  Whatever they make over to you must\nbe removed from someone else.  I pray that you may get such control\nover yourself that your mind, now shaken by wandering thoughts, may at\nlast come to rest and be steadfast, that it may be content with itself\nand, having attained an understanding of what things are truly good, -\nand they are in our possession as soon as we have this knowledge, - that\nit may have no need of added years.  He has at length passed beyond\nall necessities - he has won his honourable discharge and is free, - who\nstill lives after his life has been completed.  Farewell.\n~XXXIII+ ON THE FUTILITY OF LEARNING MAXIM\nYou wish me to close these letters also, as\nI closed my former letters, with certain utterances taken from the chiefs\nof our school.  But they did not interest themselves in choice extracts;\nthe whole texture of their work is full of strength.  There is unevenness,\nyou know, when some objects rise conspicuous above others.  A single\ntree is not remarkable if the whole forest rises to the same height.\nPoetry is crammed with utterances of this sort, and so is history.\nFor this reason I would not have you think that these utterances belong\nto Epicurus. they are common property and are emphatically our own./a\n<Ep1-233>\nEPISTLE XXXIII.\nThey are, however, more noteworthy in Epicurus, because they appear\nat infrequent intervals and when you do not expect them, and because it\nis surprising that brave words should be spoken at any time by a man who\nmade a practice of being effeminate.  For that is what most persons\nmaintain. In my own opinion, however, Epicurus is really a brave man, even\nthough he did wear long sleeves./a Fortitude, energy, and readiness for\nbattle are to be found among the Persians/b, just as much as among men\nwho have girded themselves up high.,\nTherefore, you need not call upon me for extracts\nand quotations; such thoughts as one may extract here and there in the\nworks of other philosophers run through the whole body of our writings.\nHence we have no \"show-window goods,\" nor do we deceive the purchaser in\nsuch a way that, if he enters our shop, he will find nothing except that\nwhich is displayed in the window.  We allow the purchasers themselves\nto get their samples from anywhere they please.  Suppose we should\ndesire to sort out each separate motto from the general stock; to whom\nshall we credit them?  To Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Panaetius,\nor Posidonius?  We Stoics are not subjects of a despot: each of us\nlays claim to his own freedom. With them,/c on the ether hand, whatever\nHermarchus says or Metrodorus, is ascribed to one source.  In that\nbrotherhood, everything that any man utters is spoken under the leadership\nand commanding authority/d of one alone.  We cannot, I maintain, no\nmatter how we try, pick out anything from so great a multitude of things\nequally good.\nOnly the poor man counts his flock./e\n<Ep1-235>\nEPISTLE XXXIII.\nWherever you direct your gaze, you will meet with something that might\nstand out from the rest, if the context in which you read it were not equally\nnotable.\nFor this reason, give over hoping that you\ncan skim, by weans of epitomes, the wisdom of distinguished men.\nLook into their wisdom as a whole; study it as a whole.  They are\nworking out a plan and weaving together, line upon line, a masterpiece,\nfrom which nothing can be taken away without injury to the whole.\nExamine the separate parts, if you like, provided you examine them as parts\nof the man himself.  She is not a beautiful woman whose ankle or arm\nis praised, but she whose general appearance makes you forget to admire\nher single attributes.\nIf you insist, however, I shall not be niggardly\nwith you, but lavish; for there is a huge multitude of these passages;\nthey are scattered about in profusion, - they do not need to be gathered\ntogether, but merely to be picked up.  They do not drip forth occasionally;\nthey flow continuously.  They are unbroken and are closely connected.\nDoubtless they would be of much benefit to those who are still novices\nand worshipping outside the shrine; for single maxims sink in more easily\nwhen they are marked of and bounded like a line of verse.  That is\nwhy we give to children a proverb, or that which the Greeks call Chria,/a\nto be learned by heart; that sort of thing can be comprehended by the young\nmind, which cannot as yet hold more.  For a man, however, whose progress\nis definite, to chase after choice extracts and to prop his weakness by\nthe best known and the briefest sayings and to depend upon his memory,\nis disgraceful; it is time for him to lean on himself.  He should\nmake such maxims and not memorize them.  For it is disgraceful even\nfor an\n<Ep1-237>\nEPISTLE XXXIII.\nold man, or one who has sighted old age, to have a note-book knowledge.\n\"This is what Zeno said.\" But what have you yourself said? \"This is the\nopinion of Cleanthes.\" But what is your own opinion?  How long shall\nyou march under another man's orders? {Thoreau+}\nTake command, and utter some word which posterity will remember.\nPut forth something from your own stock. For this reason I hold that there\nis nothing of eminence in all such men as these, who never create anything\nthemselves, but always lurk in the shadow of others, playing the role of\ninterpreters, never daring to put once into practice what they have been\nso long in learning.  They have exercised their memories on other\nmen's material.  But it is one thing to remember, another to know.\nRemembering is merely safeguarding something entrusted to the memory; knowing,\nhowever, means making everything your own; it means not depending upon\nthe copy and not all the time glancing back at the master. \"Thus said Zeno,\nthus said Cleanthes, indeed!\" Let there be a difference between yourself\nand your book!  How long shall you be a learner?  From now on\nbe a teacher as well! \"But why,\" one asks,/a \"should I have to continue\nhearing lectures on what I can read?\" \"The living voice,\" one replies,\n\"is a great help.\" Perhaps, but not the voice which merely makes itself\nthe mouthpiece of another's words, and only performs the duty of a reporter.\nConsider this fact also.  Those who have\nnever attained their mental independence begin, in the first place, by\nfollowing the leader in cases where everyone has deserted the leader; then,\nin the second place, they follow him in matters where the truth is still\nbeing investigated.  However, the truth will\n<Ep1-239>\nEPISTLES XXXIII., XXXIV.\nnever be discovered if we rest contented with discoveries already made.\nBesides, he who follows another not only discovers nothing but is not even\ninvestigating.  What then?  Shall I not follow in the footsteps\nof my predecessors? I shall indeed use the old road, but if I find one\nthat makes a shorter cut and is smoother to travel, I shall open the new\nroad.  Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters,\nbut our guides.  Truth lies open for all; it has not yet been monopolized.\nAnd there is plenty of it left even for posterity to discover.  Farewell.\n~XXXIV+ ON A PROMISING PUPIL\nI grow in spirit and leap for joy and shake off my\nyears and my blood runs warm again, whenever I understand, from your actions\nand your letters, how far you have outdone yourself; for as to the ordinary\nman, you left him in the rear long ago.  If the farmer is pleased\nwhen his tree develops so that it bears fruit, if the shepherd takes pleasure\nin the increase of his flocks, if every man regards his pupil as though\nhe discerned in him his own early manhood, - what, then, do you think are\nthe feelings of those who have trained a mind and moulded a young idea,\nwhen they see it suddenly grown to maturity?\nI claim you for myself; you are my handiwork.\nWhen I saw your abilities, I laid my hand upon you,/a I exhorted you, I\napplied the goad and did not permit you to march lazily, but roused you\ncontinually.  And now I do the same; but by this time I am cheering\non one who is in the race and so in turn cheers me on.\n<Ep1-241>\nEPISTLES XXXIV., XXXV.\n\"What else do you want of me, then?\" you ask;\n\"the will is still mine.\" Well, the will in this case is almost everything,\nand not merely the half, as in the proverb \"A task once begun is half done.\"\nIt is more than half, for the matter of which we speak is determined by\nthe soul./a Hence it is that the larger part of goodness is the will to\nbecome good.  You know what I mean by a good man?  One who is\ncomplete, finished, - whom no constraint or need can render bad.\nI see such a person in you, if only you go steadily on and bend to your\ntask, and see to it that all your actions and words harmonize and correspond\nwith each other and are stamped in the same mould.  If a man's acts\nare out of harmony, his soul is crooked.  Farewell.\n~XXXV+ ON THE FRIENDSHIP OF KINDRED MINDS\nWhen I urge you so strongly to your studies, it\nis my own interest which I am consulting; I want your\nfriendship+, and it cannot fall to my lot unless you proceed, as\nyou have begun, with the task of developing yourself.  For now, although\nyou love{amo+} me, you are not yet my friend.\n\"But,\" you reply, \"are these words of different meaning?\" Nay, more, they\nare totally unlike in meaning./b A friend loves you, of course; but one\nwho loves you is not in every case your friend.  Friendship, accordingly,\nis always helpful, but love sometimes even does harm.  Try to perfect\nyourself, if for no other reason, in order that you may learn how to love.\nHasten, therefore, in order that, while thus\nperfecting yourself for my benefit, you may not have -------- b The question\nof Lucilius represents the popular view, which regards love as including\nfriendship.  But according to Seneca it is only the perfect love,\nfrom which all selfishness has been removed, that becomes identical with\nfriendship.\n<Ep1-243>\nEPISTLE XXXV.\nlearned perfection for the benefit of another.  To be sure, I am\nalready deriving some profit by imagining that we two shall be of one mind,\nand that whatever portion of my strength has yielded to age will return\nto me from your strength, although there is not so very much difference\nin our ages.  But yet I wish to rejoice in the accomplished fact.\nWe feel a joy over those whom we love, even when separated from them, but\nsuch a joy is light and fleeting; the sight of a man, and his presence,\nand communion with him, afford something of living pleasure; this is true,\nat any rate, if one not only sees the man one desires, but the sort of\nman one desires. Give yourself to me, therefore, as a gift of great price,\nand, that you may strive the more, reflect that you yourself are mortal,\nand that I am old.  Hasten to find me, but hasten to find yourself\nfirst.  Make progress, and, before all else, endeavour to be consistent\nwith yourself.  And when you would find out whether you have accomplished\nanything, consider whether you desire the same things today that you desired\nyesterday.  A shifting of the will indicates that the mind is at sea,\nheading in various directions, according to the course of the wind.\nBut that which is settled and solid does not wander from its place.\nThis is the blessed lot of the completely wise man, and also, to a certain\nextent, of him who is progressing and has made some headway.  Now\nwhat is the difference between these two classes of men?  The one\nis in motion, to be sure, but does not change its position; it merely tosses\nup and down where it is; the other is not in motion at all. {Eliot_still_pt+}\nFarewell. <Ep1-245>\nEPISTLE XXXVI.\n~XXXVI.  ON THE VALUE OF RETIREMENT\nEncourage your friend to despise stout-heartedly\nthose who upbraid him because he has sought the shade of retirement and\nhas abdicated his career of honours, and, though he might have attained\nmore, has preferred tranquillit.y to them all.  Let him prove daily\nto these detractors how wisely he has looked out for his own interests.\nThose whom men envy will continue to march past him; some will be pushed\nout of the ranks, and others will fall.  Prosperity is a turbulent\nthing; it torments itself. it stirs the brain in more ways than one, goading\nmen on to various aims, some to power, and others to high living.\nSome it puffs up; others it slackens and wholly enervates.\n\"But,\" the retort comes, \"so-and-so carries\nhis prosperity well.\" Yes; just as he carries his liquor.  So you\nneed not let this class of men persuade you that one who is besieged by\nthe crowd is happy; they run to him as crowds rush for a pool of water,\nrendering it muddy while they drain it.  But you say: \"Men call our\nfriend a trifler and a sluggard.\" There are men, you know, whose speech\nis awry, who use the contrary/a terms.  They called him happy; what\nof it?  Was he happy? Even the fact that to certain persons he seems\na man of a very rough and gloomy cast of mind, does not trouble me.\nAristo/b used to say that he preferred a youth of stern disposition to\none who was a jolly fellow and agreeable to the crowd. \"For,\" he added,\n\"wine which, when new, seemed harsh and sour, becomes good wine; but that\nwhich tasted well at the vintage <Ep1-247>\nEPISTLE XXXVI.\ncannot stand age.\" So let them call him stern and a foe to his own advancement,\nit is just this sternness that will go well when it is aged, provided only\nthat he continues to cherish virtue and to absorb thoroughly the studies\nwhich make for culture, - not those with which it is sufficient for a man\nto sprinkle himself, but those in which the mind should be steeped.\nNow is the time to learn. \"What?  Is there any time when a man should\nnot learn?\" By no means; but just as it is creditable for every age to\nstudy, so it is not creditable for every age to be instructed.  An\nold man learning his A B C is a disgraceful and absurd object; the young\nman must store up, the old man must use.  You will therefore be doing\na thing most helpful to yourself if you make this friend of yours as good\na man as possible; those kindnesses, they tell us, are to be both sought\nfor and bestowed, which benefit the giver no less than the receiver; and\nthey are unquestionably the best kind.\nFinally, he has no longer any freedom in the\nmatter; he has pledged his word.  And it is less disgraceful to compound\nwith a creditor than to compound with a promising future.  To pay\nhis debt of money, the business man must have a prosperous voyage, the\nfarmer must have fruitful fields and kindly weather; but the debt which\nyour friend+ owes can be completely paid\nby mere goodwill. {Bassanio+}\nFortune has no jurisdiction over\ncharacter+. {PlainDealer+}\nLet him so regulate his character that in perfect peace he may bring to\nperfection that spirit within him which feels neither loss nor gain, but\nremains in the same attitude, no matter how things fall out.  A spirit\nlike this, if it is heaped with worldly goods, rises superior to its wealth;\nif, on the other hand, chance <Ep1-249>\nEPISTLE XXXVI.\nhas stripped him of a part of his wealth, or even all, it is not impaired.\nIf your friend had been born in Parthia, he would have begun, when a child,\nto bend the bow; if in Germany, he would forthwith have been brandishing\nhis slender spear; if he had been born in the days of our forefathers,\nhe would have learned to ride a horse and smite his enemy hand to hand.\nThese are the occupations which the system of each race recommends to the\nindividual, - yes, prescribes for him.  To what, then, shall this\nfriend/a of yours devote his attention?  I say, let him learn that\nwhich is helpful against all weapons, against every kind of foe, - contempt\nof death; because no one doubts that death has in it something that inspires\nterror, so that it shocks even our souls, which nature has so moulded that\nthey love their own existence; for otherwise/b there would be no need to\nprepare ourselves, and to whet our courage, to face that towards which\nwe should move with a sort of voluntary instinct, precisely as all men\ntend to preserve their existence.  No man learns a thing in order\nthat, if necessity arises, he may lie down with composure upon a bed of\nroses; but he steels his courage to this end, that he may not surrender\nhis plighled faith+ to torture, and that,\nif need be, he may some day stay out his watch in the trenches, even though\nwounded, without even leaning on his spear; because sleep is likely to\ncreep over men who support themselves by any prop whatsoever.\nIn death there is nothing harmful; for there\nmust exist something to which it is harmful./c And yet, if you are possessed\nby so great a craving for a longer life, reflect that none of the objects\nwhich vanish from our gaze and are re-absorbed into the <Ep1-251>\nEPISTLES XXXVI., XXXVII.\nworld of things, from which they have come forth and are soon to come\nforth again, is annihilated; they merely end their course and do not perish.\nAnd death, which we fear and shrink from, merely interrupts life, but does\nnot steal it away; the time will return when we shall be restored to the\nlight of day; and many men would object to this, were they not brought\nback in forgetfulness of the past.\nBut I mean to show you later,/a with more\ncare, that everything which seems to perish merely changes.  Since\nyou are destined to return, you ought to depart with a tranquil mind.\nMark how the round of the universe repeats its course; you will see that\nno star in our firmament is extinguished, but that they all set and rise\nin alternation. Summer has gone, but another year will bring it again;\nwinter lies low, but will be restored by its own proper months; night has\noverwhelmed the sun, but day will soon rout the night again.  The\nwandering stars retrace their former courses; a part of the sky is rising\nunceasingly, and a part is sinking.  One word more, and then I shall\nstop; infants, and boys, and those who have gone mad, have no fear of death,\nand it is most shameful if reason cannot afford us that peace of mind to\nwhich they have been brought by their folly.  Farewell.\n~XXXVII.  ON ALLEGIANCE TO VIRTUE\nYou have promised to be a good man; you have\nenlisted under oath; that is the strongest chain which will hold you to\na sound understanding.  Any man will be but mocking you, if he declares\nthat this is an effeminate and easy kind of soldiering.  I <Ep1-253>\nEPISTLES XXXVII., XXXVIII.\nwill not have you deceived.  The word of this most honourable compact\nare the same as the words of that most disgraceful one, to wit/a: \"Through\nburning, imprisonment, or death by the sword.\" From the men who hire out\ntheir strength for the arena, who eat and drink what they must pay for\nwith their blood, security is taken that they will endure such trials even\nthough they be unwilling; from you, that you will endure them willingly\nand with alacrity.  The gladiator may lower his weapon and testy of\nthe people;/b but you will neither lower your weapon nor beg for life.\nYou must die erect and unyielding.  Moreover, what profit is it to\ngain a few days or a few years?  There is no discharge for us from\nthe moment we are born.\n\"Then how can I free myself?\" you ask.\nYou cannot escape necessities, but you can overcome them By force a way\nis made./c\nAnd this way will be afforded you by philosophy.\nBetake yourself therefore to philosophy if you would be safe, untroubled,\nhappy, in fine, if you wish to be, - and that is most important, - free.\nThere is no other way to attain this end.  Folly/d is low, abject,\nmean, slavish, and exposed to many of the cruellest passions.  These\npassions+, which are heavy taskmasters, sometimes ruling by turns,\nand sometimes together, can be banished from you by wisdom, which is the\nonly real freedom.  There is but one path leading thither, and it\nis a straight path; you will not go astray.  Proceed with steady step,\nand if you would have all things under your control, put yourself under\nthe control of reason; if reason becomes your ruler, you will become ruler\nover many.\n<Ep1-255>\nEPISTLES XXXVII., XXXVIII.\nYou will learn from her what you should undertake, and how it should\nbe done; you will not blunder into things.  You can show me no man\nwho knows how he began to crave that which he craves.  He has not\nbeen led to that pass by forethought; he has been driven to it by impulse.\nFortune attacks us as often as we attack Fortune.  It is disgraceful,\ninstead of proceeding ahead, to be carried along, and then suddenly, amid\nthe whirlpool of events,{Hamlet+}\nto ask in a dazed way: \"How did I get into this condition?\" Farewell.\n~XXXVIII+ ON QUIET CONVERSATION\nYou are right when you urge that we increase our\nmutual traffic in letters.  But the greatest benefit is to be derived\nfrom conversation, because it creeps by degrees into the soul.  Lectures\nprepared beforehand and spouted in the presence of a throng have in them\nmore noise but less intimacy.  Philosophy is good advice; and no one\ncan give advice at the top of his lungs.  Of course we must sometimes\nalso make use of these harangues, if I may so call them, when a doubting\nmember needs to be spurred on; but when the aim is to make a man learn\nand not merely to make him wish to learn, we must have recourse to the\nlow-toned words of conversation. They enter more easily, and stick in the\nmemory; for we do not need many words, but, rather, effective words.\nWords should be scattered like seed; no matter\nhow small the seed may be, if it has once found favourablc ground, it unfolds\nits strength and from an insignificant thing spreads to its greatest growth.\n<Ep1-257>\nEPISTLES XXXVIII., XXXIX.\nReason grows in the same way; it is not large to the outward view, but\nincreases as it does its work.  Few words are spoken; but if the mind\nhas truly caught them, they come into their strength and spring up.\nYes, precepts and seeds have the same quality; they produce much, and yet\nthey are slight things.  Only, as I said, let a favourable mind receive\nand assimilate them. Then of itself the mind also will produce bounteously\nin its turn, giving back more than it has received.  Farewell.\n~XXXIX+ ON NOBLE ASPIRATIONS\nI shall indeed arrange for you, in careful order\nand narrow compass, the notes which you request.  But consider whether\nyou may not get more help from the customary method/a than from that which\nis now commonly called a \"breviary,\" though in the good old days, when\nreal Latin was spoken, it was called a \"summary.\"/b The former is more\nnecessary to one who is learning a subject, the latter to one who knows\nit.  For the one teaches, the other stirs the memory.  But I\nshall give you abundant opportunity for both./c A man like you should not\nask me for this authority or that; he who furnishes a voucher for his statements\nargues himself unknown.  I shall therefore write exactly what you\nwish, but I shall -------- b i.e., the word breviarium, \"abridgment,\" \"abstract,\"\nhas displaced the better word \"summarium,\" \"outline of chief points.\" c\ni.e., to do the reading and to review it by means of the summary.\nThe reading will enable Lucillus to identify for himself the authors of\nthe several passages or doctrines.\n<Ep1-259>\nEPISTLE XXXIX.\ndo it in my own way; until then, you have many authors whose works will\npresumably keep your ideas sufficiently in order.  Pick up the list\nof the philosophers; that very act will compel you to wake up, when you\nsee how many men have been working for your benefit.  You will desire\ncagerly to be one of them yourself, for this is the most excellent quality\nthat the noble soul has within itself, that it can be roused to honourable\nthings.\nNo man of exalted gifts is pleased with that\nwhich is low and mean; the vision of great achievement summons him and\nuplifts him.  Just as the flame springs straight into the air and\ncannot be cabined or kept down any more than it can repose in quiet, so\nour soul is always in motion, and the more ardent it is, the greater its\nmotion and activity.  But happy is the man who has given it this impulse\ntoward better things!  He will place himself beyond the jurisdiction\nof chance; he will wisely control prosperity; he will lessen adversity,\nand will despise what others hold in admiration.  It is the quality\nof a great soul to scorn great things and to prefer that which is ordinary\nrather than that which is too great.  For the one condition is useful\nand lifegiving; but the other does harm just because it is excessive.\nSimilarly, too rich a soil makes the grain fall flat, branches break down\nunder too heavy a load, excessive productiveness does not bring fruit to\nripeness.  This is the case with the soul also; for it is ruined by\nuncontrolled prosperity, which is used not only to the detriment of others,\nbut also to the detriment of itself. What enemy was ever so insolent to\nany opponent as are their pleasures to certain men?  The only excuse\nthat we can allow for the incontinence and mad lust of these men is\n<Ep1-261>\nEPISTLES XXXIX., XL.\nthe fact that they suffer the evils which they have inflicted upon others.\nAnd they are rightly harassed by this madness, because desire must have\nunbounded space for its excursions, if it transgresses nature's mean.\nFor this has its bounds, but waywardness and the acts that spring from\nwilful lust are without boundaries.  Utility measures our needs; but\nby what standard can you check the superfluous?  It is for this reason\nthat men sink themselves in pleasures, and they cannot do without them\nwhen once they have become accustomed to them, and for this reason they\nare most wretched, because they have reached such a pass that what was\nonce superfluous to them has become indispensable.  And so they are\nthe slaves of their pleasures instead of enjoying them; they even love\ntheir own ills,/a - and that is the worst ill of all!  Then it is\nthat the height of unhappiness is reached, when men are not only attracted,\nbut even pleased, by shameful things, and when there is no longer any room\nfor a cure, now that those things which once were vices have become habits.\nFarewell.\n~XL+ ON THE PROPER STYLE FOR A PHILOSOPHER'S\nDISCOURSE\nI thank you for writing to me so often; for\nyou are revealing your real self to me in the only way you can.  I\nnever receive a letter from you without being in your company forthwith.\nIf the pictures of our absent friends are pleasing to us, though they only\nrefresh the memory and lighten our longing by a solace that is unreal and\nunsubstantial, how much more pleasant is a letter, which brings us real\ntraces,\n<Ep1-263>\nEPISTLE XL.\nreal evidences, of an absent friend!  For that which is sweetest\nwhen we meet face to face is afforded by the impress of a friend's hand\nupon his letter, -recognition.\nYou write me that you heard a lecture by the\nphilosopher Serapio,/a when he landed at your present place of residence.\n\"He is wont,\" you say, \"to wrench up his words with a mighty rush, and\nhe does not let them flow forth one by one, but makes them crowd and dash\nupon each other./b For the words come in such quantity that a single voice\nis inadequate to utter them.\" I do not approve of this in a philosopher;\nhis speech, like his life, should be composed; and nothing that rushes\nheadlong and is hurried is well ordered.  That is why, in Homer, the\nrapid style, which sweeps down without a break like a snow-squall, is assigned\nto the younger speaker; from the old man eloquence flows gently, sweeter\nthan honey./c\nTherefore, mark my words; that forceful manner\nof\nspeech, rapid and copious, is more suited to a mountebank than to a man\nwho is discussing and teaching an important and serious subject.\nBut I object just as strongly that he should drip out his words as that\nhe should go at top speed; he should neither keep the ear on the stretch,\nnor deafen it.  For that poverty-stricken and thin-spun style also\nmakes the audience less attentive because they are weary of its stammering\nslowness; nevertheless, the word which has been long awaited sinks in more\neasily than the word which flits past us on the wing.  Finally, people\nspeak of \" handing down\" precepts to their pupils; but one is not \" handing\ndown\" that which eludes the grasp.  Besides, speech that deals with\nthe truth should be unadorned and plain. {PlainDealer+}\nThis\n<Ep1-265>\nEPISTLE XL.\npopular style has nothing to do with the truth; its aim is to impress\nthe common herd, to ravish heedless ears by its speed; it does not offer\nitself for discussion, but snatches itself away from discussion.\nBut how can that speech govern others which cannot itself be governed?\nMay I not also remark that all speech which is employed for the purpose\nof healing our minds, ought to sink into us?  Remedies do not avail\nunless they remain in the system.  Besides, this sort of speech contains\na great deal of sheer emptiness; it has more sound than power.  My\nterrors should be quieted, my irritations soothed, my illusions shaken\noff, my indulgences checked, my greed rebuked.  And which of these\ncures can be brought about in a hurry? What physician can heal his patient\non a flying visit?  May I add that such a jargon of confused and ill-chosen\nwords cannot afford pleasure, either? No; but just as you are well satisfied,\nin the majority of cases, to have seen through tricks which you did not\nthink could possibly be done,/a so in the case of these word-gymnasts to\nhave heard them once is amply sufficient. For what can a man desire to\nlearn or to imitate in them?  What is he to think of their souls,\nwhen their speech is sent into the charge in utter disorder, and cannot\nbe kept in hand?  Just as, when you run down hill, you cannot stop\nat the point where you had decided to stop, but your steps are carried\nalong by the momentum of your body and are borne beyond the place where\nyou wished to halt; so this speed of speech has no control over itself,\nnor is it seemly for philosophy; since philosophy should carefully place\nher words, not fling them out, and should proceed step by step.\n<Ep1-267>\nEPISTLE XL.\n\"What then?\" you say; \"should not philosophy\nsometimes take a loftier tone?\" Of course she should; but dignity of character\nshould be preserved, and this is stripped away by such violent and excessive\nforce.  Let philosophy possess great forces, but kept well under control;\nlet her stream flow unceasingly, but never become a torrent.  And\nI should hardly allow even to an orator a rapidity of speech like this,\nwhich cannot be called back, which goes lawlessly ahead; for how could\nit be followed by jurors, who are often inexperienced and untrained?\nEven when the orator is carried away by his desire to show off his powers,\nor by uncontrollable emotion, even then he should not quicken his pace\nand heap up words to an extent greater than the ear can endure.\nYou will be acting rightly, therefore, if\nyou do not regard those men who seek how much they may say, rather than\nhow they shall say it, and if for yourself you choose, provided a choice\nmust be made, to speak as Publius Vinicius the stammerer does.  When\nAsellius was asked how Vinicius spoke, he replied: \"Gradually\"! (It was\na remark of Geminus Varius, by the way: \"I don't see how you can call that\nman 'eloquent'; why, he can't get out three words together.\") Why, then,\nshould you not choose to speak as Vinicius does?  Though of course\nsome wag may cross your path, like the person who said, when Vinicius was\ndragging out his words one by one, as if he were dictating and not speaking.\n\" Say, haven't you anything to say?\" And yet that were the better choice,\nfor the rapidity of Quintus Haterius, the most famous orator of his age,\nis, in my opinion, to be avoided by a man of sense.  Haterius never\nhesitated, never paused; he made only one start, and only one stop.\n<Ep1-269>\nEPISTLE XL.\nHowever, I suppose that certain styles of speech\nare more or less suitable to nations also; in a Greek you can put up with\nthe unrestrained style, but we Romans, even when writing, have become accustomed\nto separate our words./a And our compatriot Cicero, with whom Roman oratory\nsprang into prominence, was also a slow pacer./b The Roman language is\nmore inclined to take stock of itself, to weigh, and to offer something\nworth weighing.  Fabianius, a man noteworthy because of his life,\nhis knowledge, and, less important than either of these, his eloquence\nalso, used to discuss a subject with dispatch rather than with haste; hence\nyou might call it ease rather than speed.  I approve this quality\nin the wise man; but I do not demand it; only let his speech proceed unhampered,\nthough I prefer that it should be deliberately uttered rather than spouted.\nHowever, I have this further reason for frightening\nyou away from the latter malady, namely, that you could only be successful\nin practising this style by losing your sense of modesty; you would have\nto rub all shame from your countenance,/c and refuse to hear yourself speak.\nFor that heedless flow will carry with it many expressions which you would\nwish to criticize.  And, I repeat, you could not attain it and at\nthe same time preserve your sense of shame.  Moreover, you would need\nto practise every day, and transfer your attention from subject matter\nto words.  But words, even if they came to you readily and flowed\nwithout any exertion on your part, yet would have to be kept under control.\nFor just as a less ostentatious gait becomes a philosopher, so does a restrained\nstyle ofspeech+, far removed from boldness. {PlainDealer+}\nTherefore, the ultimate kernel of my remarks is this:  I bid you be\nslow of speech.  Farewell\n<Ep1-271>\nEPISTLE XLI.\n~XLI+ ON THE GOD WITHIN US\nYou are doing an excellent thing, one which will\nbe wholesome for you, if, as you write me, you are persisting in your effort\nto attain sound understanding; it is foolish to pray for this when you\ncan acquire it from yourself.  We do not need to uplift our hands\ntowards heaven, or to beg the keeper of a temple to let us approach his\nidol's ear, as if in this way our prayers were more likely to be heard.\nGod is near you, he is with you, he is within you.  This is what I\nmean, Lucilius: a holy spirit indwells within us, one who marks our good\nand bad deeds, and is our guardian.  As we treat this spirit, so are\nwe treated by it. Indeed, no man can be good without the help of God.\nCan one rise superior to\nfortune+ unless God helps him to rise?  He it is that gives\nnoble and upright counsel.  In each good man\nA god doth dwell, but w\nat god know we not./a\nIf ever you have come upon a grove that is\nfull of ancient trees which have grown to an unusual height, shutting out\na view of the sky by a veil of pleached and intertwining branches, then\nthe loftiness of the forest, the seclusion of the spot, and your marvel\nat the thick unbroken shade in the midst of the open spaces, will prove\nto you the presence of deity.  Or if a cave, made by the deep crumbling\nof the rocks, holds up a mountain on its arch, a place not built --------\na Vergil, Aeneid, viii. 352. . . .\n<Ep1-273>\nEPISTLE XLI.\nwith hands but hollowed out into such spaciousness by natural causes,\nyour soul will be deeply moved by a certain intimation of the existence\nof God.  We worship the sources of mighty rivers; we erect altars\nat places where great streams burst suddenly from hidden sources; we adore\nsprings of hot water as divine, and consecrate certain pools because of\ntheir dark waters or their immeasurable depth.  If you see a man who\nis unterrified in the midst of dangers, untouched by desires, happy in\nadversity, peaceful amid the storm, who looks down upon men from a higher\nplane, and views the gods on a footing of equality, will not a feeling\nof reverence for him steal over you, will you not say: \"This quality is\ntoo great and too lofty to be regarded as resembling this petty body in\nwhich it dwells? A divine power has descended upon that man.\" When a soul\nrises superior to other souls, when it is under control, when it passes\nthrough every experience as if it were of small account, when it smiles\nat our fears and at our prayers, it is stirred by a force from heaven.\nA thing like this cannot stand upright unless it be propped by the divine.\nTherefore, a greater part of it abides in that place from whence it came\ndown to earth. Just as the rays of the sun do indeed touch the earth, but\nstill abide at the source from which they are sent; even so the great and\nhallowed soul, which has come down in order that we may have a nearer knowledge\nof divinity, does indeed associate with us, but still cleaves to its origin;\non that source it depends, thither it tums its gaze and strives to go,\nand it concerns itself with our doings only as a being superior to ourselves.\nWhat, then, is such a soul?  One which is resplendent with no external\ngood, but only with its\n<Ep1-275>\nEPISTLE XLI.\nown.  For what is more foolish than to praise in a man the qualities\nwhich come from without?  And what is more insane than to marvel at\ncharacteristics which may at the next instant be passed on to someone else?\nA golden bit does not make a better horse.  The lion with gilded mane,\nin process of being trained and forced by weariness to endure the decoration,\nis sent into the arena in quite a different way from the wild lion whose\nspirit is unbroken; the latter, indeed, bold in his attack, as nature wished\nhim to be, impressive because of his wild appearance, - and it is his glory\nthat none can look upon him without fear, - is favoured/a in preference\nto the other lion, that languid and gilded brute.\nNo man ought to glory except in that which\nis his own.  We praise a vine if it makes the shoots teem with increase,\nif by its weight it bends to the ground the very poles which hold its fruit;\nwould any man prefer to this vine one from which golden grapes and golden\nleaves hang down?  In a vine the virtue peculiarly its own is fertility;\nin man also we should praise that which is his own.  Suppose that\nhe has a retinue of comely slaves and a beautiful house, that his farm\nis large and large his income; none of these things is in the man himself;\nthey are all on the outside.  Praise the quality in him which cannot\nbe given or snatched away, that which is the peculiar property of the man.\nDo you ask what this is?  It is soul, and reason brought to perfection\nin the soul. For man is a reasoning animal.  Therefore, man's highest\ngood is attained, if he has fulfilled the good for which nature designed\nhim at birth.  And what is it which this reason demands of him?\nThe easiest thing in the world,\n<Ep1-277>\nEPISTLES XLI., XLII.\n- to live in accordance with his own nature.  But this is turned\ninto a hard task by the general madness of mankind; we push one another\ninto vice.  And how can a man be recalled to salvation, when be has\nnone to restrain him, and all mankind to urge him on?  Farewell.\n~XLII+ ON VALUES\nHas that friend of yours already made you believe that he is\na good man?  And yet it is impossible in so short a time for one either\nto become good or be known as such./a Do you know what kind of man I now\nmean when I speak of \"a good man\"?  I mean one of the second grade,\nlike your friend.  For one of the first class perhaps springs into\nexistence, like the phoenix, only once in five hundred years.  And\nit is not surprising, either, that greatness develops only at long intervals;\nFortune often brings into being commonplace powers, which are born to please\nthe mob; but she holds up for our approval that which is extraordinary\nby the very fact that she makes it rare.\nThis man, however, of whom you spoke, is still\nfar from the state which he professes to have reached.  And if he\nknew what it meant to be \"a good man,\" he would not yet believe himself\nsuch; perhaps he would even despair of his ability to become good. \"But,\"\nyou say, \"he thinks ill of evil men.\" Well, so do evil men themselves;\nand there is no worse penalty for vice than the fact that it is dissatisfied\nwith itself and all its fellows. \"But he hates those who make an ungoverned\nuse of great power suddenly acquired.\" I retort that he will do the\n<Ep1-279>\nEPISTLE XLII.\nsame thing as soon as he acquires the same powers.  In the case\nof many men, their vices, being powerless, escape notice; although, as\nsoon as the persons in question have become satisfied with their own strength,\nthe vices will be no less daring than those which prosperity has already\ndisclosed.  These men simply lack the means whereby they may unfold\ntheir wickedness.  Similarly, one can handle even a poisonous snake\nwhile it is stiff with cold; the poison is not lacking; it is merely numbed\ninto inaction. In the case of many men, their cruelty, ambition, and indulgence\nonly lack the favour of Fortune to make them dare crimes that would match\nthe worst. That their wishes are the same you will in a moment discover,\nin this way: give them the power equal to their wishes.\nDo you remember how, when you declared that\na certain person was under your influence, I pronounced him fickle and\na bird of passage, and said that you held him not by the foot but merely\nby a wing?  Was I mistaken?  You grasped him only by a feather;\nhe left it in your hands and escaped.  You know what an exhibition\nhe afterwards made of himself before you, how many of the things he attempted\nwere to recoil upon his own head.  He did not see that in endangering\nothers he was tottering to his own downfall.  He did not reflect how\nburdensome were the objects which he was bent upon attaining, even if they\nwere not superfluous.\nTherefore, with regard to the objects which\nwe pursue, and for which we strive with great effort, we should note this\ntruth; either there is nothing desirable in them, or the undesirable is\npreponderant.  Some objects are superfluous; others are not worth\n<Ep1-281>\nEPISTLE XLII.\nthe price we pay for them.  But we do not see this clearly, and\nwe regard things as free gifts when they really cost us very dear.\nOur stupidity may be clearly proved by the fact that we hold that \"buying\"\nrefers only to the objects for which we pay cash, and we regard as free\ngifts the things for which we spend our very selves.  These we should\nrefuse to buy, if we were compelled to give in payment for them our houses\nor some attractive and profitable estate; but we are eager to attain them\nat the cost of anxiety, of danger, and of lost honour, personal freedom,\nand time; so true it is that each man regards nothing as cheaper than himself.\nLet us therefore act, in all our plans and\nconduct, just as we are accustomed to act whenever we approach a huckster\nwho has certain wares for sale; let us see how much we must pay for that\nwhich we crave.  Very often the things that cost nothing cost us the\nmost heavily; I can show you many objects the quest and acquisition of\nwhich have wrested freedom from our hands.  We should belong to ourselves,\nif only these things did not belong to us.\nI would therefore have you reflect thus, not\nonly when it is a question of gain, but also when it is a question of loss.\n\"This object is bound to perish.\" Yes, it was a mere extra; you will live\nwithout it just as easily as you have lived before.  If you have possessed\nit for a long time, you lose it after you have had your fill of it; if\nyou have not possessed it long, then you lose it before you have become\nwedded to it. \"You will have less money.\" Yes, and less trouble. \"Less\ninfluence.\" Yes, and less envy.  Look about you and note the things\nthat drive us mad, which we lose with a flood of tears; you will perceive\nthat it is not the loss that troubles us with\n<Ep1-283>\nEPISTLES XLII., XLIII.\nreference to these things, but a notion of loss.  No one feels\nthat they have been lost, but his mind tells him that it has been so.\nHe that owns himself has lost nothing.  But how few men are blessed\nwith ownership of self!  Farewell.\n~XLIII+ ON THE RELATIVITY OF FAME\nDo you ask how the news reached me, and who\ninformed me, that you were entertaining this idea, of which you had said\nnothing to a single soul?  It was that most knowing of persons, -\ngossip. \"What,\" you say, \"am I such a great personage that I can stir up\ngossip?\" Now there is no reason why you should measure yourself according\nto this part of the world/a; have regard only to the place where you are\ndwelling. Any point which rises above adjacent points is great, at the\nspot where it rises.  For greatness is not absolute; comparison increases\nit or lessens it.  A ship which looms large in the river seems tiny\nwhen on the ocean. A rudder which is large for one vessel, is small for\nanother.\nSo you in your province/b are really of importance,\nthough you scorn yourself.  Men are asking what you do, how you dine,\nand how you sleep, and they find out, too; hence there is all the more\nreason for your living circumspectly.  Do not, however, deem yourself\ntruly happy until you find that you can live before men's eyes, until your\nwalls protect but do not hide you; although we are apt to believe that\nthese walls surround us, not to enable us to live more safely, but that\nwe may sin more secretly. I shall mention a fact by which you may weigh\nthe worth of a man's character: you will scarcely find anyone\n<Ep1-285>\nEPISTLES XLIII., XLIV.\nwho can live with his door wide open.  It is our conscience, not\nour pride, that has put doorkeepers at our doors; we live in such a fashion\nthat being suddenly disclosed to view is equivalent to being caught in\nthe act.  What profits it, however, to hide ourselves away, and to\navoid the eyes and ears of men?  A good conscience welcomes the crowd,\nbut a bad conscience, even in solitude, is disturbed and troubled.\nIf your deeds are honourable, let everybody know them; if base, what matters\nit that no one knows them, as long as you yourself know them?  How\nwretched you are if you despise such a witness!  Farewell.\n~XLIV+ ON PHILOSOPHY AND PEDIGREES\nYou are again insisting to me that you are\na nobody, and saying that nature in the first place, and fortune in the\nsecond, have treated you too scurvily, and this in spite of the fact that\nyou have it in your power to separate yourself from the crowd and rise\nto the highest human happiness!  If there is any good in philosophy,\nit is this, - that it never looks into pedigrees.  All men, if traced\nback to their original source, spring from the gods.  You are a Roman\nknight, and your persistent work promoted you to this class; yet surely\nthere are many to whom the fourteen rows are barred; \"the senate-chamber\nis not open to all; the army, too, is scrupulous in choosing those whom\nit admits to toil and danger.  But a noble mind is free to all men;\naccording to this test, we may all gain distinction.  Philosophy neither\nrejects nor selects anyone; its light shines for all.  Socrates was\nno aristocrat.  Cleanthes\n<Ep1-287>\nEPISTLE XLIV.\nworked at a well and served as a hired man watering a garden.\nPhilosophy did not find Plato already a nobleman; it made him one.\nWhy then should you despair of becoming able to rank with men like these?\nThey are all your ancestors, if you conduct yourself in a manner worthy\nof them; and you will do so if you convince yourself at the outset that\nno man outdoes you in real nobility.  We have all had the same number\nof forefathers; there is no man whose first beginning does not transcend\nmemory.  Plato says: \"Every king springs from a race of slaves, and\nevery slave has had kings among his ancestors.\"/a {common+}\nThe flight of time, with its vicissitudes, has jumbled all such things\ntogether, and Fortune has turned them upside down.  Then who is well-born?\nHe who is by nature well fitted for virtue. That is the one point to be\nconsidered; otherwise, if you hark back to antiquity, every one traces\nback to a date before which there is nothing. From the earliest beginnings\nof the universe to the present time, we have been led forward out of origins\nthat were alternately illustrious and ignoble. A hall full of smoke- begrimed\nbusts does not make the nobleman.  No past life has been lived to\nlend us glory, and that which has existed before us is not ours; the soul\nalone renders us noble, and it may rise superior to Fortune out of any\nearlier condition, no matter what that condition has been./b {Wyf+}\nSuppose, then, that you were not that Roman knight, but a freedman, you\nmight nevertheless by your own efforts come to be the only free man amid\na throng of gentlemen. \"How?\" you ask.  Simply by distinguishing between\ngood and bad things without patterning your opinion from the populace.\nYou should look, not to the source from which these\n<Ep1-289>\nEPISTLES XLIV., XLV.\nthings come, but to the goal towards which they tend.  If there\nis anything that can make life happy, it is good on its own merits; for\nit cannot degenerate into evil.  Where, then, lies the mistake, since\nall men crave the happy life?  It is that they regard the means for\nproducing happiness as happiness itself, and, while seeking happiness,\nthey are really fleeing from it. For although the sum and substance of\nthe happy life is unalloyed freedom from care, and though the secret of\nsuch freedom is unshaken confidence, yet men gather together that which\ncauses worry, and, while travelling life's treacherous road, not only have\nburdens to bear, but even draw burdens to themselves; hence they recede\nfarther and farther from the achievement of that which they seek, and the\nmore effort they expend, the more they hinder themselves and are set back.\nThis is what happens when you hurry through a maze; the faster you go,\nthe worse you are entangled.  Farewell.\n~XLV+ ON SOPHISTICAL ARGUMENTATION\nYou complain that in your part of the world there is a scant supply\nof books.  But it is quality, rather than quantity, that matters;\na limited list of reading benefits; a varied assortment serves only for\ndelight. He who would arrive at the appointed end must follow a single\nroad and not wander through many ways.  What you suggest is not travelling;\nit is mere tramping. \"But,\" you say, \"I should rather have you give me\nadvice than books.\" Still, I am ready to send you all the books I have,\nto ransack the whole storehouse.  If it were possible, I should join\nyou there\n<Ep1-291>\nEPISITLE XLV. myself; and were it not for the hope that you will soon\ncomplete your term of offic\ne, I should have imposed upon myself this old man's journey; no Scylla\nor Charybdis or their storied straits could have frightened me away.\nI should not only have crossed over, but should have been willing to swim\nover those waters, provided that I could greet you and judge in your presence\nhow much you had grown in spirit.\nYour desire, however, that I should dispatch\nto you my own writings does not make me think myself learned, any more\nthan a request for my picture would flatter my beauty.  I know that\nit is due to your charity rather than to your judgment.  And even\nif it is the result of judgment, it was charity that forced the judgment\nupon you.  But whatever the quality of my works may be, read them\nas if I were still seeking, and were not aware of, the truth, and were\nseeking it obstinately, too. For I have sold myself to no man; I bear the\nname of no master.  I give much credit to the judgment of great men;\nbut I claim something also for my own.  For these men, too, have left\nto us, not positive discoveries, but problems whose solution is still to\nbe sought.  They might perhaps have discovered the essentials, had\nthey not sought the superfluous also.  They lost much time in quibbling\nabout words and in sophistical argumentation; all that sort of thing exercises\nthe wit to no purpose.  We tie knots and bind up words in double meanings,\nand then try to untie them.\nHave we leisure enough for this?  Do\nwe already know how to live, or die?  We should rather proceed with\nour whole souls towards the point where it is our duty to take heed lest\nthings, as well as words, deceive us.  Why, pray, do you discriminate\nbetween\n<Ep1-293>\nEPISTLE XLV.\nsimilar words, when nobody is ever deceived by them except during the\ndiscussion?  It is things that lead us astray: it is between things\nthat you must discriminate.  We embrace evil instead of good; we pray\nfor something opposite to that which we have prayed for in the past.\nOur prayers clash with our prayers, our plans with our plans.  How\nclosely flattery resembles friendship!  It not only apes\nfriendship+, but outdoes it, passing it in the race; with wide-open\nand indulgent ears it is welcomed and sinks to the depths of the heart,\nand it is pleasing precisely wherein it does harm. Show me how I may be\nable to see through this resemblance!  An enemy comes to me full of\ncompliments, in the guise of a friend.  Vices creep into our hearts\nunder the name of virtues, rashness lurks beneath the appellation of\nbravery+, moderation is called sluggishness, and the\ncoward+ is regarded as prudent; there is great danger if we go astray\nin these matters.  So stamp them with special labels.\nThen, too, the man who is asked whether he\nhas horns on his head/a is not such a fool as to feel for them on his forehead,\nnor again so silly or dense that you can persuade him by means of argumentation,\nno matter how subtle, that he does not know the facts.  Such quibbles\nare just as harmlessly deceptive as the juggler's cup and dice, in which\nit is the very trickery that pleases me.  But show me how the trick\nis done, and I have lost my interest therein.  And I hold the same\nopinion about these tricky word-plays; for by what other name can one call\nsuch sophistries? Not to know them does no harm, and mastering them does\nno good.  At any rate, if you wish to sift doubtful meanings of this\nkind, teach us that the happy man is not he whom the crowd\n<Ep1-295>\nEPISTLE XLV\ndeems happy, namely, he into whose coffers mighty sums have flowed,\nbut he whose possessions are all in his soul, who is upright and exalted,\nwho spurns inconstancy, who sees no man with whom he wishes to change places,\nwho rates men only at their value as men, who takes Nature for his teacher,\nconforming to her laws and living as she commands, whom no violence can\ndeprive of his possessions, who turns evil into good, is unerring in judgment,\nunshaken, unafraid, who may be moved by force but never moved to distraction,\nwhom Fortune when she hurls at him with all her might the deadliest missile\nin her armoury, may graze, though rarely, but never wound.  For Fortune's\nother missiles, with which she vanquishes mankind in general, rebound from\nsuch a one, like hail which rattles on the roof with no harm to the dweller\ntherein, and then melts away. {Hamlet+}\nWhy do you bore me with that which you yourself call the \"liar\" fallacy,\"/a\nabout which so many books bave been written?  Come now, suppose that\nmy whole life is a lie; prove that to be wrong and, if you are sharp enough,\nbring that back to the truth. At present it holds things to be essential\nof which the greater part is superfluous.  And even that which is\nnot superfluous is of no significance in respect to its power of making\none fortunate and blest.  For if a thing be necessary, it does not\nfollow that it is a good.  Else we degrade the meaning of \"good,\"\nif we apply that name to bread and barley-porridge and other commodities\nwithout which we cannot live.  The good must in every case be necessary;\nbut that which is necessary is not in every case a good, since certain\nvery paltry things are indeed necessary.  No one is to such an extent\nignorant of the noble meaning of the word \"good,\" as to debase it to the\nlevel of these humdrum utilities. -------- a e.g.  Gellius, xviii.2.10\ncum mentior et mentiri me dico, mentior an verum dico?\n<Ep1-297>\nEPISTLES XLV., XLVI.\nWhat, then?  Shall you not rather transfer\nyour efforts to making it clear to all men that the search for the superfluous\nmeans a great outlay of time, and that many have gone through life merely\naccumulating the instruments of life?  Consider individuals, survey\nmen in general; there is none whose life does not look forward to the morrow.\n\"What harm is there in this,\" you ask?  Infinite harm; for such persons\ndo not live, but are preparing to live.  They postpone everything.\nEven if we paid strict attention, life would soon get ahead of us; but\nas we are now, life finds us lingering and passes us by as if it belonged\nto another, and though it ends on the final day, it perishes every day.\nBut I must not exceed the bounds of a letter,\nwhich ought not to fill the reader's left hand./a So I shall postpone to\nanother day our case against the hair-splitters, those over- subtle fellows\nwho make argumentation supreme instead of subordinate.  Farewell.\n~XLVI+ ON A NEW BOOK BY LUCILIUS\nI received the book of yours which you promised\nme.  I opened it hastily with the idea of glancing over it at leisure;\nfor I meant only to taste the volume.  But by its own charm the book\ncoaxed me into traversing it more at length.  You may understand from\nthis fact how eloquent it was; for it seemed to be written in the smooth\nstyle,/b and yet did not resemble your handiwork or mine, but at first\nsight might have been ascribed to Titus Livius or to Epicurus.  Moreover,\nI was so impressed and carried along by its charm that I finished it without\n-------- a Possibly levis the sense of liqht, referring to size.\n<Ep1-299>\nEPISTLES XLVI., XLVII.\nany postponement.  The sunlight called to me, hunger warned, and\nclouds were lowering; but I absorbed the book from beginning to end.\nI was not merely pleased; I rejoiced.\nSo full of wit and spirit it was!  I should have added \"force,\" had\nthe book contained moments of repose, or had it risen to energy only at\nintervals.  But I found that there was no burst of force, but an even\nflow, a style that was vigorous and chaste.  Nevertheless I noticed\nfrom time to time your sweetness, and here and there that mildness of yours.\nYour style is lofty and noble; I want you to keep to this manner and this\ndirection.  Your subject also contributed something; for this reason\nyou should choose productive topics, which will lay hold of the mind and\narouse it.  I shall discuss the book more fully after a second perusal;\nmeantime, my judgment is somewhat unsettled, just as if I had heard it\nread aloud, and had not read it myself.  You must allow me to examine\nit also.  You need not be afraid; you shall hear the truth. Lucky\nfellow, to offer a man no opportunity to tell you lies at such long range!\nUnless perhaps, even now, when excuses for lying are taken away, custom\nserves as an excuse for our telling each other lies!  Farewell.\n~XLVII+ ON MASTER AND SLAVE\nI am glad to learn, through those who come from you,\nthat you live on friendly terms with your slaves+.\nThis befits a sensible and well-educated man like yourself. \"They are slaves,\"\npeople declare.\" Nay, rather they are men. \"Slaves!\" No, comrades.\n<Ep1-301>\nEPISTLE XLVII.\n\" Slaves!\" No, they are unpretentious friends.\n\"Slaves!\" No, they are our fellow-slaves, if one reflects that, Fortune\nhas equal rights over slaves and free men alike.\nThat is why I smile at those who think it\ndegrading for a man to dine with his slave.  But why should they think\nit degrading?  It is only because purse-proud etiquette surrounds\na householder at his dinner with a mob of standing slaves.  The master\neats more than he can hold, and with monstrous greed loads his belly until\nit is stretched and at length ceases to do the work of a belly; so that\nhe is at greater pains to discharge all the food than he was to stuff it\ndown.  All this time the poor slaves may not move their lips, even\nto speak.  The slightest murmur is repressed by the rod; even a chance\nsound, - a cough, a sneeze, or a hiccup, - is visited with the lash.\nThere is a grievous penalty for the slightest breach of silence.\nAll night long they must stand about, hungry and dumb.\nThe result of it all is that these slaves,\nwho may not talk in their master's presence, talk about their master.\nBut the slaves of former days, who were permitted to converse not only\nin their master's presence, but actually with him, whose mouths were not\nstitched up tight, were ready to bare their necks for their master, to\nbring upon their own heads any danger that threatened him; they spoke at\nthe feast, but kept silence during torture.  Finally, the saying,\nin allusion to this same highhanded treatment, becomes current: \"As many\nenemies as you have slaves.\" They are not enemies when we acquire them;\nwe make them enemies.\nI shall pass over other cruel and inhuman\nconduct towards them; for we maltreat them, not as if they\n<Ep1-303>\nEPISTLE XLVII.\nwere men, but as if they were beasts of burden.  When we recline\nat a banquet, one slave mops up the disgorged food, another crouches beneath\nthe table and gathers up the left-overs of the tipsy guests.  Another\ncarves the priceless game birds; with unerring strokes and skilled hand\nhe cuts choice morsels along the breast or the rump.  Hapless fellow,\nto live only for the purpose of cutting fat capons correctly - unless,\nindeed, the other man is still more unhappy than he, who teaches this art\nfor pleasure's sake, rather than he who learns it because he must.\nAnother, who serves the wine, must dress like a woman and wrestle with\nhis advancing years; he cannot get away from his boyhood; he is dragged\nback to it; and though be has already acquired a soldier's figure, he is\nkept beardless by having his hair smoothed away or plucked out by the roots,\nand he must remain awake throughout the night, dividing his time between\nhis master's drunkenness and his lust; in the chamber be must be a man,\nat the feast a boy./a Another, whose duty it is to put a valuation on the\nguests, must stick to his task, poor fellow, and watch to see whose flattery\nand whose immodesty, whether of appetite or of language, is to get them\nan invitation for to- morrow. Think also of the poor purveyors of food,\nwho note their masters' tastes with delicate skill, who know what special\nflavours will sharpen their appetite, what will please their eyes, what\nnew combinations will rouse their cloyed stomachs, what food will excite\ntheir loathing through sheer satiety, and what will stir them to hunger\non that particular day.  With slaves like these the master cannot\nbear to dine; he would think it beneath his dignity to associate with his\nslave at the same table!  Heaven forfend!\n<Ep1-305>\nEPISTLE XLVII.\nBut how many masters is he creating in these\nvery men!  I have seen standing in the line, before the door of Callistus,\nthe former master/a, of Callistus; I have seen the master himself shut\nout while others were welcomed, - the master who once fastened the \"For\nSale\" ticket on Callistus and put him in the market along with the good-for-nothing\nslaves.  But he has been paid off by that slave who was shuffled into\nthe first lot of those on whom the crier practises his lungs; the slave,\ntoo, in his turn has cut his name from the list and in his turn has adjudged\nhim unfit to enter his house.  The master sold Callistus, but how\nmuch has Callistus made his master pay for!  Kindly remember that\nhe whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon\nby the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and\ndies.  It is just as possible for you to see in him a free-born man\nas for him to see in you a slave.  As a result of the massacres in\nMarius's/b day, many a man of distinguished birth, who was taking the first\nsteps toward senatorial rank by service in the army, was humbled by fortune,\none becoming a shepherd, another a caretaker of a country cottage.\nDespise, then, if you dare, those to whose estate you may at any time descend,\neven when you are despising them.\nI do not wish to involve myself in too large\na question, and to discuss the treatment of slaves, towards whom we Romans\nare excessively haughty, cruel, and insulting.  But this is the kernel\nof my advice:  Treat your inferiors as you would be treated by your\nbetters. And as often as you reflect how much power you have over a slave,\nremember that your master has just as much power over you. \"But I have\nno master,\" you say.  You are still\n<Ep1-307>\nEPISTLE XLVII.\nyoung; perhaps you will have one.  Do you not know at what age\nHecuba entered captivity, or Croesus, or the mother of Darius, or Plato,\nor Diogenes?/a\nAssociate with your slave on kindly, even\non affable, terms; let him talk with you, plan with you, live with you.\nI know that at this point all the exquisites will cry out against me in\na body; they will say: \"There is nothing more debasing, more disgraceful,\nthan this.\" But these are the very persons whom I sometimes surprise kissing\nthe hands of other men's slaves.  Do you not see even this, how our\nancestors removed from masters everything invidious, and from slaves everything\ninsulting? They called the master \"father of the household,\" and the slaves\n\"members of the household+,\" a custom\nwhich still holds in the mane.  They established a holiday on which\nmasters and slaves should eat together, - not as the only day for this\ncustom, but as obligatory on that day in any case.  They allowed the\nslaves to attain honours in the household and to pronounce judgment/b;\nthey held that a household was a miniature commonwealth.\n\"Do you mean to say,\" comes the retort, \"that\nI must seat all my slaves at my own table?\" No, not any more than that\nyou should invite all free men to it.  You are mistaken if you think\nthat I would bar from my table certain slaves whose duties are more humble,\nas, for example, yonder muleteer or yonder herdsman; I propose to value\nthem according to their character, and not according to their duties.\nEach man acquires his character for himself, but accident assigns his duties.\nInvite some to your table because they deserve the ho\n<Ep1-309>\nEPISTLE XLVII.\nany slavish quality in them as the result of their low associations,\nit will be shaken off by intercourse with men of gentler breeding.\nYou need not, my dear Lucillus, hunt for friends only in the forum or in\nthe Senate-house; if you are careful and attentive, you will find them\nat home also.  Good material often stands idle for want of an artist;\nmake the experiment, and you will find it so.  As he is a fool who,\nwhen purchasing a horse, does not consider the animal's points, but merely\nhis saddle and bridle; so he is doubly a fool who values a man from his\nclothes or from his rank+, which indeed is\nonly a robe that clothes us.\n\"He is a slave.\" His soul, however, may be\nthat of a freeman. \"He is a slave.\" But shall that stand in his way?\nShow me a man who is not a slave; one is a slave to lust, another to greed,\nanother to ambition, and all men are slaves to fear.  I will name\nyou an ex-consul who is slave to an old hag, a millionaire who is slave\nto a serving-maid; I will show you youths of the noblest birth in serfdom\nto pantomime players! No servitude is more disgraceful than that which\nis self-imposed.\nYou should therefore not be deterred by these\nfinicky persons from showing yourself to your slaves as an affable person\nand not proudly superior to them; they ought to respect you rather than\nfear you.  Some may maintain that I am now offering the liberty-cap\nto slaves in general and toppling down lords from their high estate, because\nI bid slaves respect their masters instead of fearing them.  They\nsay: \"This is what he plainly means: slaves are to pay respect as if they\nwere clients or early-morning callers!\" Anyone who holds this opinion forgets\nthat what is enough for a god cannot be too little\n<Ep1-311>\nEPISTLES XLVII., XLVIII.\nfor a master.  Respect means love+,\nand love and fear cannot be mingled. So I hold that you are entirely right\nin not wishing to be feared by your slaves, and in lashing them merely\nwith the tongue; only dumb animals need the thong.  That which annoys\nus does not necessarily injure us; but we are driven into wild rage by\nour luxurious lives, so that whatever does not answer our whims arouses\nour anger.  We don the temper of kings+. {Lear+}\nFor they, too, forgetful alike of their own strength and of other men's\nweakness, grow white-hot with rage, as if they had received an injury,\nwhen they are entirely protected from danger of such injury by their exalted\nstation.  They are not unaware that this is true, but by finding fault\nthey seize upon opportunities to do harm; they insist that they have received\ninjuries, in order that they may inflict them.\nI do not wish to delay you longer; for you\nneed no exhortation.  This, among other things, is a mark of good\ncharacter: it forms its own judgments and abides by them; but badness is\nfickle and frequently changing, not for the better, but for something different.\nFarewell.\n~XLVIII+ ON\nQUIBBLING+ AS UNWORTHY OF THE PH ILOSOPHER\nIn answer to the letter which you wrote me\nwhile travelling, - a letter as long as the journey itself, - I shall reply\nlater.  I ought to go into retirement, and consider what sort of advice\nI should give you.  For you yourself, who consult me, also reflected\nfor a long time whether to do so; how much more, then, should I myself\nreflect, since more\n<Ep1-313>\nEPISTLE XLVIII.\ndeliberation is necessary in settling than in propounding a problem!\nAnd this is particularly true when one thing is advantageous to you and\nanother to me.  Am I speaking again in the guise of an Epicurean/a?\nBut the fact is, the same thing is advantageous to me which is advantageous\nto you; for I am not your friend unless whatever is at issue concerning\nyou is my concern also. Friendship+ produces\nbetween us a partnership in all our interests.  There is no such thing\nas good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in\ncommon+.  And no one can live happily who has regard to himself\nalone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you\nmust live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself.  This\nfellowship, maintained with scrupulous care, which makes us mingle as men\nwith our fellow-men and holds that the human race have certain rights in\ncommon, is also of great help in cherishing the more intimate fellowship\nwhich is based on friendship, concerning which I began to speak above.\nFor he that has much in common with a fellow-man will have all things in\ncommon with a friend.\nAnd on this point, my excellent Lucilius,\nI should like to have those subtle dialecticians of yours advise me how\nI ought to help a friend, or how a fellowman, rather than tell me in how\nmany ways the word \"friend\" is used, and how many meanings the word \"man\"\npossesses.  Lo, Wisdom and Folly are taking opposite sides.\nWhich shall I join?  Which party would you have me follow?  On\nthat side, \"man\" is the equivalent of \"friend\"; on the other side, \"friend\"\nis not the equivalent of \"man.\" The one wants a friend for his own advantage;\nthe other wants to make himself an advantage to his\n<Ep1-315>\nEPISTLE XLVIII.\nfriend./a What you have to offer me is nothing but distortion of words\nand splitting of syllables.  It is clear that unless I can devise\nsome very tricky, premisses and by false deductions tack on to them a fallacy\nwhich springs from the truth, I shall not be able to distinguish between\nwhat is desirable and what is to be avoided!  I am ashamed!\nOld men as we are, dealing with a problem so serious, we make play of it!\n\"'Mouse' is a syllable./b Now a mouse eats\nits cheese; therefore, a syllable eats cheese.\" Suppose now that I cannot\nsolve this problem; see what peril hangs over my head as a result of such\nignorance!  What a scrape I shall be in!  Without doubt I must\nbeware, or some day I shall be catching syllables in a mousetrap, or, if\nI grow careless, a book may devour my cheese!  Unless, perhaps, the\nfollowing syllogism is shrewder still: \"'Mouse' is a syllable.  Now\na syllable does not eat cheese. Therefore a mouse does not eat cheese.\"\nWhat childish nonsense!  Do we knit our brows over this sort of problem?\nDo we let our beards grow long for this reason?  Is this the matter\nwhich we teach with sour and pale faces?\nWould you really know what philosophy offers\nto humanity?  Philosophy offers counsel.  Death calls away one\nman, and poverty chafes another; a third is worried either by his neighbour's\nwealth or by his own.  So-and-so is afraid of bad luck; another desires\nto get away from his own good fortune.  Some are ill- treated by men,\nothers by the gods.  Why, then, do you frame for me such games as\nthese?  It is no occasion for jest; you are retained as counsel for\nunhappy ma\n<Ep1-317>\nEPISITLE XLVIII.\nsick and the needy, and those whose heads are under the poised axe.\nWhither are\nyou straying?  What are you doing?\nThis friend, in whose company you are jesting,\nis in fear.  Help him, and take the noose from about his neck.\nMen are stretching out imploring hands to you on all sides; lives ruined\nand in danger of ruin are begging for some assistance; men's hopes, men's\nresources, depend upon you.  They ask that you deliver them from all\ntheir restlessness, that you reveal to them, scattered and wandering as\nthey are, the clear light of truth.  Tell them what nature has made\nnecessary, and what superfluous; tell them how simple are the laws that\nshe has laid down, how pleasant and unimpeded life is for those who follow\nthese laws, but how bitter and perplexed it is for those who have put their\ntrust in opinion rather than in nature.\nI should deem your games of\nlogic+ to be of some avail in relieving men's burdens, if you could\nfirst show me what part of these burdens they will relieve.  What\namong these games of yours banishes lust?  Or controls it?  Would\nthat I could say that they were merely of no profit!  They are positively\nharmful.  I can make it perfectly clear to you whenever you wish,\nthat a noble spirit when involved in such subtleties is impaired and weaken@d.\nI am ashamed to say what weapons they supply to men who are destined to\ngo to war with fortune, and how poorly they equip them!  Is this the\npath to the greatest good?  Is philosophy to proceed by such claptrap/a\nand by quibbles which would be a disgrace and a\n<Ep1-319>\nEPISTLE XLVIII.\nreproach even for expounders/a of the law?  For what else is it\nthat you men are doing, when you deliberately ensnare the person to whom\nyou are putting questions, than making it appear that the man has lost\nhis case on a technical error?/b But just as the judge can reinstate those\nwho have lost a suit in this way, so philosophy has reinstated these victims\nof quibbling to their former condition.  Why do you men abandon your\nmighty promises, and, after having assured me in high-sounding language\nthat you will permit the glitter of gold to dazzle my eyesight no more\nthan the gleam of the sword, and that I shall, with mighty steadfastness,\nspurn both that which all men crave and that which all men fear, why do\nyou descend to the ABC's of scholastic pedants?  What is your answer?\nIs this the path to heaven?/a For that is exactly what pbilosophy promises\nto me, that I shall be made equal to God.  For this I have been summoned,\nfor this purpose have I come.  Philosophy, keep your promise!\nTherefore, my dear Lucilius, withdraw yourself\nas far as possible from these exceptions and objections of so-called philosophers.\nFrankness, and simplicity beseem true goodness. {PlainDealer+}\nEven if there were many years left to you, you would have had to spend\nthem frugally in order to have enough for the necessary thing; but as it\nis, when your time is so scant, what madness it is to learn superfluous\nthings!  Farewell.\n<Ep1-321>\nEPISTLE XLIX.\n~XLIX+ ON THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE\nA man is indeed lazy and careless, my dear\nLucilius, if he is reminded of a friend only by seeing some landscape which\nstirs the memory; and yet there are times when the old familiar haunts\nstir up a sense of loss that has been stored away in the soul, not bringing\nback dead memories, but rousing them from their dormant state, just as\nthe sight of a lost friend's favourite slave, or his cloak, or his house,\nrenews the mourner's grief, even though it has been softened by time.\nNow, lo and behold, Campania, and especially\nNaples and your beloved Pompeii,/a struck me, when I viewed them, with\na wonderfully fresh sense of longing for you.  You stand in full view\nbefore my eyes.  I am on the point of parting from you. {Antonio+}\nI see you choking down your tears and resisting without success the emotions\nthat well up at the very moment when you try to check them.  I seem\nto have lost you but a moment ago.  For what is not \"but a moment\nago\" when one begins to use the memory?  It was but a moment ago that\nI sat, as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion,/b but a moment\nago that I began to plead in the courts, but a moment ago that I lost the\ndesire to plead, but a moment ago that I lost the ability.  Infinitely\nswift is the flight of time, as those see more clearly who are looking\nbackwards.  For when we are intent on the present, we do not notice\nit, so gentle is the passage of time's headlong flight.  Do you ask\nthe reason for this?  All past time is in the same place; it all presents\nthe same aspect to us, it lies together.  Everything slips into the\nsame abyss. {abysm+}\n<Ep1-323>\nEPISTLE XLIX.\nBesides, an event which in its entirety is of brief compass cannot contain\nlong intervals.  The time which we spend in living is but a point,\nnay, even less than a point.  But this point of time, infinitesimal\nas it is, nature has mocked by making it seem outwardly of longer duration;\nshe has taken one portion thereof and made it infancy, another childhood,\nanother youth, another the gradual slope, so to speak, from youth to old\nage, and old age itself is still another.  How many steps for how\nshort a climb! It was but a moment ago that I saw you off on your journey;\nand yet this \"moment ago\" makes up a goodly share of our existence, which\nis so brief, we should reflect, that it will soon come to an end altogether.\nIn other years time did not seem to me to go so swiftly; now, it seems\nfast beyond belief, perhaps, because I feel that the finish-line is moving\ncloser to me, or it may be that I have begun to take heed and reckon up\nmy losses.\nFor this reason I am all the more angry that\nsome men claim the major portion of this time for superfluous things, -\ntime which, no matter how carefully it is guarded, cannot suffice even\nfor necessary things.  Cicero/a declared that if the number of his\ndays were doubled, he should not have time to read the lyric poets./b And\nyou may rate the dialecticians in the same class; but they are foolish\nin a more melancholy way.  The lyric poets are avowedly frivolous;\nbut the dialecticians+ believe that\nthey are themselves engaged upon serious business.  I do not deny\nthat one must cast a glance at dialectic; but it ought to be a mere glance,\na sort of greeting from the threshold, merely that one may not be deceived,\nor judge these pursuits to contain any hidden matters of great worth.\n<Ep1-325>\nEPISTLE XLIX.\nWhy do you torment yourself and lose weight\nover some problem which it is more clever to have scorned than to solve?\nWhen a soldier is undisturbed and travelling at his ease, he can hunt for\ntrifles along his way; but when the enemy is closing in on the rear, and\na command is given to quicken the pace, necessity makes him throw away\neverything which he picked up in moments of peace and leisure.  I\nhave no time to investigate disputed inflections of words, or to try my\ncunning upon them.\nBehold the gathering cl\nns, the fast-shut gates, And weapons whetted ready for the war./a I need\na stout heart to hear without flinching this din of battle which sounds\nround about.  And all would rightly think me mad if, when graybeards\nand women were heaping up rocks for the fortifications, when the armour-clad\nyouths inside the gates were awaiting, or even demanding, the order for\na sally, when the spears of the foemen were quivering in our gates and\nthe very ground was rocking with mines and subterranean passages, - I say,\nthey would rightly think me mad if I were to sit idle, putting such petty\nposers as this: \"What you have not lost, you have.  But you have not\nlost any horns.  Therefore, you have horns,\" or other tricks constructed\nafter the model of this piece of sheer silliness.  And yet I may well\nseem in your eyes no less mad, if I spend my energies on that sort of thing;\nfor even now I am in a state of siege.  And yet, in the former case\nit would be merely a peril from the outside that threatened me, and a wall\nthat sundered me from the foe; as it is now, death-dealing perils are in\nmy very presence.  I have no time for such nonsense; a\n<Ep1-327>\nEPISTLE XLIX.\nmighty undertaking is on my hands.  What am I to do?  Death\nis on my trail, and life is fleeting away; teach me something with which\nto face these troubles.  Bring it to pass that I shall cease trying\nto escape from death, and that life may cease to escape from me.\nGive me courage to meet hardships; make me calm in the face of the unavoidable.\nRelax the straitened limits of the time which is allotted me.  Show\nme that the good in life does not depend upon life's length, but upon the\nuse we make of it; also, that it is possible, or rather usual, for a man\nwho has lived long to have lived too little.  Say to me when I lie\ndown to sleep: \"You may not wake again!\" And when I have waked: \"You may\nnot go to sleep again!\" Say to me when I go forth from my house: \"You may\nnot return!\" And when I return: \"You may never go forth again!\" You are\nmistaken if you think that only on an ocean voyage there is a very slight\nspace/a between life and death.  No, the distance between is just\nas narrow everywhere.  It is not everywhere that death shows himself\nso near at hand; yet everywhere he is as near at hand.\nRid me of these shadowy terrors; then you\nwill more easily deliver to me the instruction for which I have prepared\nmyself.  At our birth nature made us teachable, and gave us reason,\nnot perfect, but capable of being perfected.  Discuss for me justice,\nduty, thrift, and that twofold purity, both the purity which abstains from\nanother's person, and that which takes care of one's own self.  If\nyou will only refuse to lead me along by- paths, I shall more easily reach\nthe goal at which I am aiming.  For, as the tragic poet/b says:\n<Ep1-329>\nEPISTLES XLIX., L.\nThe language of truth is simple.  We should not, therefore, make\nthat language intricate; since there is nothing less fitting for a soul\nof great endeavour than such crafty cleverness.  Farewell.\n~L+ ON OUR BLINDNESS AND ITS CURB\nI received your letter many months after you\nhad posted it; accordingly, I thought it useless to ask the carrier what\nyou were busied with.  He must have a particularly good memory if\nhe can remember that!  But I hope by this time you are living in such\na way that I can be sure what it is you are busied with, no matter where\nyou may be. For what else are you busied with except improving yourself\nevery day, laying aside some error, and coming to understand that the faults\nwhich you attribute to circumstances are in yourself?  We are indeed\napt to ascribe certain faults to the place or to the time; but those faults\nwill follow us, no matter how we change our place. {Thoreau+}\nYou know Harpaste, my wife's female clown; she has remained in my house,\na burden incurred from a legacy.  I particularly disapprove of these\nfreaks; whenever I wish to enjoy the quips of a clown, I am not compelled\nto hunt far; I can laugh at myself.  Now this clown suddenly became\nblind.  The story sounds incredible, but I assure you that it is true:\nshe does not know that she is blind. She keeps asking her attendant to\nchange her quarters; she says that her apartments are too dark.\nYou can see clearly that that which makes\nus smile in the case of Harpaste happens to all the rest of us; nobody\nunderstands that he is himself greedy, or that he is covetous.  Yet\nthe blind ask for a guide,\n<Ep1-331>\nRPISTLE L. while we wander without one, saying: \"I am not self-seeking;\nbut one cannot live at Rome in any other way.  I am not extravagant,\nbut mere living in the city demands a great outlay.  It is not my\nfault that I have a choleric disposition, or that I have not settled down\nto any definite scheme of life; it is due to my youth.\" Why do we deceive\nourselves?  The evil that afflicts us is not external, it is within\nus, situated in our very vitals; for that reason we attain soundness with\nall the more difficulty, because we do not know that we are diseased.\nSuppose that we have begun the cure; when\nshall we throw off all these diseases, with all their virulence?\nAt present, we do not even consult the physician, whose work would be easier\nif he were called in when the complaint was in its early stages.\nThe tender and the inexperienced minds would follow his advice if he pointed\nout the right way.  No man finds it difficult to return to nature,\nexcept the man who has deserted nature.  We blush to receive instruction\nin sound sense; but, by Heaven, if we think it base to seek a teacher of\nthis art, we should also abandon any hope that so great a good could be\ninstilled into us by mere chance.\nNo, we must work.  To tell the truth,\neven the work is not great, if only, as I said, we begin to mould and reconstruct\nour souls before they are hardened by sin.  But I do not despair even\nof a hardened sinner.  There is nothing that will not surrender to\npersistent treatment, to concentrated and careful attention; however much\nthe timber may be bent, you can make it straight again.  Heat unbends\ncurved beams, and wood that grew naturally in another shape is fashioned\nartificially according to our needs.  How much more easily does the\nsoul permit itself to be\n<Ep1-333>\nEPISTLE L.\nshaped, pliable as it is and more yielding than any liquid!  For\nwhat else is the soul than air in a certain state?  And you see that\nair is more adaptable than any other matter, in proportion as it is rarer\nthan any other.\nThere is nothing, Lucilius, to hinder you\nfrom entertaining good hopes about us, just because we are even now in\nthe grip of evil, or because we have long been possessed thereby.\nThere is no man to whom a good mind comes before an evil one.  It\nis the evil mind that gets first hold on all of us.  Learning virtue\nmeans unlearning vice.  We should therefore proceed to the task of\nfreeing ourselves from faults with all the more courage because, when once\ncommitted to us, the good is an everlasting possession; virtue is not unlearned.\nFor opposites find difficulty in clinging where they do not belong, therefore\nthey can be driven out and hustled away; but qualities that come to a place\nwhich is rightfully theirs abide faithfully.  Virtue is according\nto nature; vice is opposed to it and hostile.  But although virtues,\nwhen admitted, cannot depart and are easy to guard, yet the first steps\nin the approach to them are toilsome, because it is characteristic of a\nweak and diseased mind to fear that which is unfamiliar.  The mind\nmust, therefore, be forced to make a beginning; from then on, the medicine\nis not bitter; for just as soon as it is curing us it begins to give pleasure.\nOne enjovs other cures only after health is restored, but a draught of\nphilosophy is at the same moment wholesome and pleasant.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-335>\nEPISTLE LI.\n~LI+ ON BAIAE AND MORALS\nEvery man does the best he can, my dear Lucilius!\nYou over there have Etna,/a, that lofty and most celebrated mountain of\nSicily; (although I cannot make out why Messala, - or was it Valgius? for\nI have been reading in both, -has called it \"unique,\" inasmuch as many\nregions belch forth fire, not merely the lofty ones where the phenomenon\nis more frequent, - presumably because fire rises to the greatest possible\nheight, - but low-lying places also.) As for myself, I do the best I can;\nI have had to be satisfied with Baiae/b; and I left it the day after I\nreached it; for Baiae is a place to be avoided, because, though it has\ncertain natural advantages, luxury has claimed it for her own exclusive\nresort. \"What then,\" you say, \"should any place be singled out as an object\nof aversion?\" Not at all.  But just as, to the wise and upright man,\none style of clothing is more suitable than another, without his having\nan aversion for any particular colour, but because he thinks that some\ncolours do not befit one who has adopted the simple life; so there are\nplaces also, which the wise man or he who is on the way toward wisdom will\navoid as foreign to good morals.  Therefore, if he is contemplating\nwithdrawal from the world, he will not select Canopus/c (although Canopus\ndoes not keep any man from living simply), nor Baiae either; for both places\nhave begun to be resorts of vice.  At Canopus luxury pampers itself\nto the utmost degree; at Baiae it is even more lax, as if the place itself\ndemanded a certain amount of licence.\nWe ought to select abodes which are wholesome\n<Ep1-337>\nEPISTLE LI.\nnot only for the body but also for the character.  Just as I do\nnot care to live in a place of torture, neither do I care to live in a\ncafe.  To witness persons wandering drunk along the beach, the riotous\nrevelling of sailing parties, the lakes a-din with choral/a song, and all\nthe other ways in which luxury, when it is, so to speak, released from\nthe restraints of law not merely sins, but blazons its sins abroad, - why\nmust I witness all this?  We ought to see to it that we flee to the\ngreatest possible distance from provocations to vice.  We should toughen\nour minds, and remove them far from the allurements of pleasure.\nA single winter relaxed Hannibal's fibre; {Antony+}\nhis pampering in Campania took the vigour out of that hero who had triumphed\nover Alpine snows.  He conquered with his weapons, but was conquered\nby his vices.  We too have a war to wage, a type of warfare in which\nthere is allowed no rest or furlough.  To be conquered, in the first\nplace, are pleasures, which, as you see, have carried off even the sternest\ncharacters.  If a man has once understood how great is the task which\nhe has entered upon, he will see that there must be no dainty oreffeminate+\nconduct.  What have I to do with those hot baths or with the sweating-room\nwhere they shut in the dry steam which is to drain your strength? Perspiration\nshould flow only after toil.\nSuppose we do what Hannibal did, - check the\ncourse of events, give up the war, and give over our bodies to be coddled.\nEvery one would rightly blame us for our untimely sloth, a thing fraught\nwith peril even for the victor, to say nothing of one who is only on the\nway to victory.  And we have even less right to do this than those\nfollowers of the Carthaginian flag; for our danger is greater than\n<Ep1-339>\nEPISTLE LI.\ntheirs if we slacken, and our toil is greater than theirs even if we\npress ahead.  Fortune is fighting against me, and I shall not carry\nout her commands.  I refuse to submit to the yoke; nay rather, I shake\noff the yoke that is upon me, - an act which demands even greater courage.\nThe soul is not to be pampered; surrendering to pleasure means also surrendering\nto pain, surrendering to toil, surrendering to poverty.  Both ambition\nand anger will wish to have the same rights over me as pleasure, and I\nshall be torn asunder, or rather pulled to pieces, amid all these conflicting\npassions.  I have set freedom before my eyes; and I am striving for\nthat reward.  And what is freedom, you ask?  It means not being\na slave to any circumstance, to any constraint, to any chance; it means\ncompelling Fortune to enter the lists on equal terms.  And on the\nday when I know that I have the upper hand, her power will be naught.\nWhen I have death in my own control, shall I take orders from her?\nTherefore, a man occupied with such reflections\nshould choose an austere and pure dwelling-place.  The spirit is weakened\nby surroundings that are too pleasant, and without a doubt one's place\nof residence can contribute towards impairing its vigour.  Animals\nwhose hoofs are hardened on rough ground can travel any road; but when\nthey are fattened on soft marshy meadows their hoofs are soon worn out.\nThe bravest soldier comes from rock-ribbed regions; but the town-bred and\nthe home-bred are sluggish in action.  The hand which turns from the\nplough to the sword never objects to toil; but your sleek and well-dressed\ndandy quails at the first cloud of dust.  Being trained in a rugged\ncountry strengthens the character and fits it for great undertakings.\nIt was\n<Ep1-341>\nEPISTLE Li.\nmore honourable in Scipio to spend his exile at Liternum /a, than at\nBaiae; his downfall did not need a setting so\neffeminate+.  Those also into whose hands the rising fortunes\nof Rome first transferred the wealth of the state, Gaius Marius, Gnaeus\nPompey, and Caesar, did indeed build villas near Baiae; but they set them\non the very tops of the mountains.  This seemed more soldier- like,\nto look down from a lofty height upon lands spread far and wide below.\nNote the situation, position, and type of building which they chose; you\nwill see that they were not country-places, - they were camps.  Do\nyou suppose that Cato would ever have dwelt in a pleasure-palace, that\nhe might count the lewd women as they sailed past, the many kinds of barges\npainted in all sorts of colours, the roses which were wafted about the\nlake, or that he might listen to the nocturnal brawls of serenaders? Would\nhe not have preferred to remain in the shelter of a trench thrown up by\nhis own hands to serve for a single night?  Would not anyone who is\na man have his slumbers broken by a war-trumpet rather than by a chorus\nof serenaders?\nBut I have been haranguing against Baiae long\nenough; although I never could harangue often enough against vice.\nVice, Lucilius, is what I wish you to proceed against, without limit and\nwithout end.  For it has neither limit nor end.  If any vice\nrend your heart, cast it away from you; and if you cannot be rid of it\nin any other way, pluck out your heart also.  Above all, drive pleasures\nfrom your sight.  Hate them beyond all other things, for they are\nlike the bandits whom the Egyptians call \"lovers,\"/b who embrace us only\nto garrotte us.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-343>\nEPISTLER LII.\n~LII+ ON CHOOSING OUR TEACHERS\nWhat is this force, Lucilius, that drags us\nin one direction when we are aiming in another, urging us on to the exact\nplace from which we long to withdraw?  What is it that wrestles with\nour spirit, and does not allow us to desire anything once for all?\nWe veer from plan to plan.  None of our wishes is free, none is unqualified,\nnone is lasting. \"But it is the fool,\" you say, \"who is inconsistent; nothing\nsuits him for long.\" But how or when can we tear ourselves away from this\nfolly?  No man by himself has sufficient strength to rise above it;\nhe needs a helping hand, and some one to extricate him.\nEpicurus/a remarks that certain men have worked\ntheir way to the truth without any one's assistance, carving out their\nown passage.  And he gives special praise to these, for their impulse\nhas come from within, and they have forged to the front by themselves.\nAgain, he says, there are others who need outside help, who will not proceed\nunless someone leads the way, but who will follow faithfully.  Of\nthese, he says, Metrodorus was one; this type of man is also excellent,\nbut belongs to the second grade.  We ourselves are not of that first\nclass, either; we shall be well treated if we are admitted into the second.\nNor need you despise a man who can gain salvation only with the assistance\nof another; the will to be saved means a great deal, too.\nYou will find still another class of man,\n- and a class not to be despised, - who can be foreed and driven into righteousness,\nwho do not need a guide as much as they require someone to encourage and,\nas it were, to force them along.  This is the third\n<Ep1-345>\nEPISTLE LII.\nvariety.  If you ask me for a man of this pattern also, Epicurus\ntells us that Hermarchus was such.  And of the two last-named classes,\nhe is more ready to congratulate the one,/a but he feels more respect for\nthe other; for although both reached the same goal, it is a greater credit\nto have brought about the same result with the more difficult material\nupon which to work. {prodigal+} Suppose\nthat two buildings have been erected, unlike as to their foundations, but\nequal in height and in grandeur.  One is built on faultless ground,\nand the process of erection goes right ahead.  In the other case,\nthe foundations have exhausted the building materials, for they have been\nsunk into soft and shifting ground and much labour has been wasted in reaching\nthe solid rock.  As one looks at both of them, one sees clearly what\nprogress the former has made but the larger and more difficult part of\nthe latter is hidden.  So with men's dispositions; some are pliable\nand easy to manage, but others have to be laboriously wrought out by hand,\nso to speak, and are wholly employed in the making of their own foundations.\nI should accordingly deem more fortunate the man who has never had any\ntrouble with himself; but the other, I feel, has deserved better of himself,\nwho has won a victory over the meanness of his own nature, and has not\ngently led himself, but has wrestled his way, to wisdom.\nYou may be sure that this refractory nature,\nwhich demands much toil, has been implanted in us.  There are obstacles\nin our path; so let us fight, and call to our assistance some helpers.\n\"Whom,\" you say, \"shall I call upon?  Shall it be this man or that/b?\"\nThere is another choice also open to you; you may go to the ancients; for\nthey have the\n<Ep1-347>\nEPISTLE LII.\ntime to help you.  We can get assistance not only from the living,\nbut from those of the past.  Let us choose, however, from among the\nliving, not men who pour forth their words with the greatest glibness,\nturning out commonplaces and holding. as it were, their own little private\nexhibitions,/a - not these, I say, but men who teach us by their lives,\nmen who tell us what we ought to do and then prove it by practice, who\nshow us what we should avoid, and then are never caught doing that which\nthey have ordered us to avoid.\nChoose as a guide one whom you will admire\nmore when you see him act than when you hear him speak, {PlainDealer+}\nOf course I would not prevent you from listening also to those philosophers\nwho are wont to hold public meetings and discussions, provided they appear\nbefore the people for the express purpose of improving themselves and others,\nand do not practise their profession for the sake of self-seeking.\nFor what is baser than philosophy courting applause?  Does the sick\nman praise the surgeon while he is operating?  In silence and with\nreverent awe submit to the cure./b Even though you cry applause, I shall\nlisten to your cries as if you were groaning when your sores were touched.\nDo you wish to bear witness that you are attentive, that you are stirred\nby the grandeur of the subject?  You may do this at the proper time;\nI shall of course allow you to pass judgment and cast a vote as to the\nbetter course.  Pythagoras made his pupils keep silence for five years;\ndo you think that they had the right on that account to break out immediately\ninto applause?\nHow mad is he who leaves the lecture-room\nin a happy frame of mind simply because of applause from the ignorant!\nWhy do you take pleasure in being praised by men whom you yourself cannot\npraise?\n<Ep1-349>\nEPISTLE LII.\nFabianus used to give popular talks, but his audience listened with\nself-control.  Occasionally a loud shout of praise mould burst forth,\nbut it was prompted by the greatness of his subject, and not by the sound\nof oratory that slipped forth pleasantly and softly.  There should\nbe a difference between the applause of the theatre and the applause of\nthe school; and there is a certain decency even in bestowing praise.\nIf you mark them carefully, all acts are always significant, and you can\ngauge character+ by even the most trifling\nsigns.  The lecherous man is revealed by his gait, by a movement of\nthe hand, sometimes by a single answer, by his touching his head with a\nfinger,/a by the shifting of his eye.  The scamp is shown up by his\nlaugh; the madman by his face and general appearance.  These qualities\nbecome known by certain marks; but you can tell the character of every\nman when you see how he gives and receives praise.  The philosopher's\naudience, from this corner and that, stretch forth admiring hands, and\nsometimes the adoring crowd almost hang over the lecturer's bead.\nBut, if you really understand, that is not praise; it is merely applause.\nThese outcries should be left for the arts which aim to please the crowd;\nlet philosophy be worshipped in silence.  Young men, indeed, must\nsometimes have free play to follow their impulses, but it should only be\nat times when they act from impulse, and when they cannot force themselves\nto be silent.  Such praise as that gives a certain kind of encouragement\nto the hearers themselves, and acts as a spur to the youthful mind.\nBut let them be roused to the matter, and not to the style; otherwise,\neloquence does them harm, making them enamoured of itself, and not of the\nsubject. -------- a The sctratching of the head with one finger was for\nsome reason regarded as a mark of effeminacy+\nor vice; cf. the charge brought against Pompey, Plutarch, Moralia, 89E\nand Ammianus, 17.11 quod genuino quodam more caput digito uno scalpebat\n. . . ut dissolutum.  Compare also Juvenal, ix.133 scalpere caput\ndigito\n<Ep1-351>\nEPISTLES LII., LIII,\nI shall postpone this topic for the present;\nit demands a long and special investigation, to show how the public should\nbe addressed, what indulgences should be allowed to a speaker on a public\noccasion, and what should be allowed to the crowd itself in the presence\nof the speaker.  There can be no doubt that philosophy has suffered\na loss, now that she has exposed her charms for sale.  But she can\nstill be viewed in her sanctuary, if her exhibitor is a priest and not\na pedlar.  Farewell.\n~LIII+ ON THE FAULTS OF THE SPIRIT\nYou can persuade me into almost anything now,\nfor I was recently persuaded to travel by water.  We cast off when\nthe sea was lazily smooth; the sky, to be sure, was heavy with nasty clouds,\nsuch as usually break into rain or squalls.  Still, I thought that\nthe few miles between Puteoli and your dear Parthenope/a might be run off\nin quick time, despite the uncertain and lowering sky.  So, in order\nto get away more quickly, I made straight out to sea for Nesis,/b with\nthe purpose of cutting across all the inlets.  But when we were so\nfar out that it made little difference to me whether I returned or kept\non, the calrn weather, which had enticed me, came to naught.  The\nstorm had not yet begun, but the ground-swell was on, and the waves kept\nsteadily coming faster.  I began to ask the pilot to put me ashore\nsomewhere; he replied that the coast was rough and a bad place to land,\nand that in a storm he feared a lee shore more than anything else.\nBut\n<Ep1-353>\nEPISTLE LIII.\nI was suffering too grievously to think of the danger, since a sluggish\nseasickness'which brought no relief was racking me, the sort that upsets\nthe liver without clearing it.  Therefore I laid down the law to my\npilot, forcing him to make for the shore, willy-nilly.  When we drew\nnear, I did not wait for things to be done in accordance with Vergil's\norders, until Prow faced seawards/a or Anchor plunged from bow;/b I remembered\nmy profession/c as a veteran devotee of cold water, and, clad as I was\nin my cloak, let myself down into the sea, just as a cold-water bather\nshould.  What do you think my feelings were, scrambling over the rocks,\nsearching out the path, or making one for myself? l understood that sailors\nhave good reason to fear the land.  It is hard to believe what I endured\nwhen I could not endure myself; you may be sure that the reason why Ulysses\nwas shipwrecked on every possible occasion was not so much because the\nsea-god was angry with him from his birth; he was simply subject to seasickness.\nAnd in the future I also, if I must go anywhere by sea, shall only reach\nmy destination in the twentieth year./d\nWhen I finally calmed my stomach (for you\nknow that one does not escape seasickness by escaping from the sea) and\nrefreshed my body with a rubdown, I began to reflect how completely we\nforget or ignore our failings, even those that affect the body, which are\ncontinually reminding us of their existence, - not to mention those which\nare more serious in proportion as they are more hidden.  A slight\nague deceives us; but when it has increased and a genuine fever has begun\nto burn, it forces even a hardy man,\n<Ep1-355>\nEPISTLE LIII.\nwho can endure much suffering, to admit that he is ill.  There\nis pain in the foot, and a tingling sensation in the joints; but we still\nhide the complaint and announce that we have sprained a joint, or else\nare tired from over-exercise.  Then the ailment, uncertain at first,\nmust be given a name; and when it begins to swell the ankles also, and\nhas made both our feet \"right\" feet,/a we are bound to confess that we\nhave the gout. The opposite holds true of diseases of the soul; the worse\none is, the less one perceives it.  You need not be surprised, my\nbeloved Lucilius. For he whose sleep is light pursues visions during slumber,\nand sometimes, though asleep, is conscious that he is asleep; but sound\nslumber annihilates our very dreams and sinks the spirit down so deep that\nit has no perception of self.  Why will no man confess his faults?\nBecause he is still in their grasp; only he who is awake can recount his\ndream, and similarly a confession of sin is a proof of sound mind. {humility+}\nLet us, therefore, rouse ourselves, that we may be able to correct our\nmistakes.  Philosophy, however, is the only power that can stir us,\nthe only power that can shake off our deep slumber.  Devote yourself\nwholly to philosophy.  You are worthy of her; she is worthy of you;\ngreet one another with a loving embrace.  Say farewell to all other\ninterests with courage and frankness.  Do not study philosophy merely\nduring your spare time./b\nIf you were ill, you would stop caring for\nyour personal concerns, and forget your business duties; you would not\nthink highly enough of any client to take active charge of his case during\na slight abatement of your sufferings.  You would try your hardest\nto be rid of the illness as soon as possible.  What,\n<Ep1-357>\nEPISTLE LIII.\nthen?  Shall you not do the same thing now?  Throw aside all\nhinndrances and give up your time to getting a sound mind; for no man can\nattain it if he is engrossed in other matters.  Philosophy wields\nher own authority; she appoints her own time and does not allow it to be\nappointed for her. She is not a thing to be followed at odd times, but\na subject for daily practice; she is mistress, and she commands our attendance.\nAlexander, when a certain state promised him a part of its territory and\nhalf its entire property, replied: \"I invaded Asia with the intention,\nnot of accepting what you might give, but of allowing you to keep what\nI might leave.\" Philosophy likewise keeps saying to all occupations: \"I\ndo not intend to accept the time which you have left over, but I shall\nallow you to keep what I myself shall leave.\"\nTurn to her, therefore, with all your soul,\nsit at her feet, cherish her; a great distance will then begin to separate\nyou from other men.  You will be far ahead of all mortals, and even\nthe gods will not be far ahead of you.  Do you ask what will be the\ndifference between yourself and the gods?  They will live longer.\nBut, by my faith, it is the sign of a great artist to have confined a full\nlikeness to the limits of a miniature.  The wise man's life spreads\nout to him over as large a surface as does all eternity to a god.\nThere is one point in which the sage has an advantage over the god; for\na god is freed from terrors by the bounty of nature, the wise man by his\nown bounty.  What a wonderful privilege, to have the weaknesses of\na man and the serenity of a god!  The power of philosophy to blunt\nthe blows of chance+ is beyond belief.\nNo missile can settle in her body; she is well-protected and impenetrable.\nShe spoils the force of some missiles and wards them\n<Ep1-359>\nEPISTLES LIII., LIV.\noff with the loose folds of her gown, as if they had no power to harm;\nothers she dashes aside, and hurls them back with such force that they\nrecoil upon the sender.  Farewell.\n~LIV+ ON ASTHMA AND DEATH\nMy ill-liealth had allowed me a long furlough, when\nsuddenly it resumed the attack. \"What kind of ill-health?\" you say.\nAnd you surely have a right to ask; for it is true that no kind is unknown\nto me.  But I have been consigned, so to speak, to one special ailment.\nI do not know why I should call it by its Greek name/a; for it is well\nenough deseribed as \"shortness of breath.\" Its attack is of very brief\nduration, like that of a squall at sea; it usually ends within an hour.\nWho indeed could brcathc his last for long?  I have passed through\nall the ills and dangers of the flesh; but nothing seems to me more troublesome\nthan this.  And naturally so; for anything else may be called illness;\nbut this is a sort of continued \"last gasp.\"/b Hence physicians call it\n\"practising how to die.\" For some day the breath will succeed in doing\nwhat it has so often essayed.  Do you think I am writing this letter\nin a merry spirit, just because I have escaped?  It would be absurd\nto take delight in such supposed restoration to health, as it would be\nfor a defendant to imagine that he had won his case when he had succeeded\nin postponing his trial. Yet in the midst of my difficult breathing I never\nceased to rest secure in cheerful and brave thoughts.  What?\" I say\nto myself does death so often\n<Ep1-361>\nEPISTLE LIV.\ntest me?  Let it do so; I myself have for a long time tested death.\"\n{Donne] \"When?\" you ask.  Before I was born.  Death is non-existence,\nand I know already what that means.  What was before me will happen\nagain after me.  If there is any suffering in this state, there must\nhave been such suffering also in the past, before we entered the light\nof day.  As a matter of fact, however, we felt no discomfort then.\nAnd I ask you, would you not say that one was the greatest of fools who\nbelieved that a lamp was worse off when it was extinguished than before\nit was lighted?  We mortals also are Iighted and extinguished; the\nperiod of suffering comes in between, but on either side there is a deep\npeace.  For, unless I am very much mistaken, my dear Lucilius, we\ngo astray in thinking that death only follows, when in reality it has both\npreceded us and will in turn follow us.  Whatever condition existed\nbefore our birth, is death.  For what does it matter whether you do\nnot begin at all, or whether you leave off, inasmuch as the result of both\nthese states is non- existence?\nI have never ceased to encourage myself with\ncheering counsels of this kind, silently, of course, since I had not the\npower to speak; then little by little this shortness of breath, already\nreduced to a sort of panting, came on at greater intervals, and then slowed\ndown and finally stopped.  Even by this time, although the gasping\nhas ceased, the breath does not come and go normally; I still feel a sort\nof hesitation and delay in breathing.  Let it be as it pleases, provided\nthere be no sigh from the soul./a Accept this assurance from me - I shall\nnever be frightened when the last hour comes; I am already prepared and\ndo not plan a whole day ahead.  But do you praise/b and imitate the\nman whom it does not\n<Ep1-363>\nEPISTLES LIV, LV\nirk to die, though he takes pleasure in living.  For what virtue\nis there in going away when you are thrust out?  And yet there is\nvirtue even in this:  I am indeed thrust out, but it is as if I were\ngoing away willingly. For that reason the wise man can never be thrust\nout, because that would mean removal from a place which he was unwilling\nto leave; and the wise man does nothing unwillingly.  He escapes necessity,\nbecause he wills to do what necessity is about to force upon him.\nFarewell.\n~LV+ ON VATIA'S VILLA\nI have just returned from a ride in my litter; and I am\nas weary as if I had walked the distance, instead of being seated.\nEven to be carried for any length of time is hard work, perhaps all the\nmore so because it is an unnatural exercise; for Nature gave us legs with\nwhich to do our own walking, and eyes with which to do our own seeing.\nOur luxuries have condemned us to weakness; we have ceased to be able to\ndo that which we have long declined to do.  Nevertheless, I found\nit necessary to give my body a shaking up, in order that the bile which\nhad gathered in my throat, if that was my trouble, might be shaken out,\nor, if the very breath within me had become, for some reason, too thick,\nthat the jolting, which I have felt was a good thing for me, might make\nit thinner.  So I insisted on being carried longer than usual, along\nan attractive beach, which bends between Cumae and Servilius Vatia's country-house,/a\nshut in by the sea on one side and the lake on the other, just like a na\n<Ep1-365>\nEPISTLE LV.\nstorm; since, as you know, the waves, when they beat upon the beach\nhard and fast, level it out ; but a continuous period of fair weather loosens\nit, when the sand, which is kept firm by the water, loses its moisture.\nAs my habit is, I began to look about for\nsomething there that might be of service to me, when my eves fell upon\nthe villa which had once belonged to Vatia.  So this was the place\nwhere that famous praetorian millionaire passed his old age!  He was\nfamed for nothing else than his life of leisure, and he was regarded as\nlucky only for that reason.  For whenever men were ruined by their\nfriendship with Asinius Gallus/a whenever others were ruined by their hatred\nof Sejanus, and later/b by their intimacy with him, - for it was no more\ndangerous to have offended him than to have loved him, - people used to\ncry out: \"O Vatia, you alone know how to live! \" But what he knew was how\nto hide, not how to live; and it makes a great deal of difference whether\nyour life be one of leisure or one of idleness.  So I never drove\npast his country-place during Vatia's lifetime without saying to myself:\n\"Here lies Vatia!\"\nBut, my dear Lucilius, philosophy is a thing\nof holiness, something to be worshipped, so much so that the very counterfeit\npleases.  For the mass of mankind consider that a person is at leisure\nwho has withdrawn from society, is free from care, self- sufficient, and\nlives for himself; but these privileges can be the reward only of the wise\nman. Does he who is a victim of anxiety know how to live for himself?\nWhat? Does he even know (and that is of first importance) how to live at\nall? For the man who has fled from affairs and from men, who has been banished\nto seclusion by the unhappiness which his own\n<Ep1-367>\nEPISTLE LV.\ndesires have brought upon him, who cannot see his neighbour more happy\nthan himself, who through fear has taken to concealment, like a frightened\nand sluggish animal. - this person is not living for himself he is living\nfor his belly, his sleep, and his lust, - and that is the most shameful\nthing in the world.  He who lives for no one does not necessarily\nlive for himself Nevertheless, there is so much in steadfastness and adherence\nto one's purpose that even sluggishness, if stubbornly maintained, assumes\nan air of authority/a with us.\nI could not describe the villa accurately;\nfor I am familiar onlly with the front of the house, and with the parts\nwhich are in public view and can be seen by the mere passer-by.  There\nare two grottoes, which cost a great deal of labour, as big as the most\nspacious hall, made by band.  One of these does not admit the rays\nof the sun, while the other keeps them until the sun sets.  There\nis also a stream running through a grove of plane- trees, which draws for\nits supply both on the sea and on Lake Acheron; it intersects the grove\njust like a race-way/b and is large enough to support fish, although its\nwaters are continually being drawn off.  When the sea is calm, however,\nthey do not use the stream, only touching the well-stocked waters when\nthe storms give the fishermen a foreed holiday.  But the most convenient\nthing about the villa is the fact that Baiae is next door, it is free from\nall the inconveniences of that resort, and yet enjoys its pleasures.\nI myself understand these attractions, and I believe that it is a villa\nsuited to every season of the year.  It fronts the west wind, which\nit intercepts in such a way that Baiae is denied it.  So it seems\nthat Vatia was no fool when he selected this place as the best in which\nto\n<Ep1-369>\nEPISTLE LV.\nspend his leisure when it was already unfruitful and decrepit.\nThe place where one lives, however, can contribute\nlittle towards tranquillity; it is the mind which must make everything\nagreeablc to itself.  I have seen men despondent in a gay and lovely\nvilla, and I have seen them to all appearance full of business in the midst\nof a solitude.  For this reason you should not refuse to believe that\nyour life is well-placed merely because you are not now in Campania.\nBut why are you not there?  Just let your thoughts travel, even to\nthis place.  You may hold converse with your friends when they are\nabsent, and indeed as often as you wish and for as long as you wish.\nFor we enjoy this, the greatest of pleasures, all the more when we are\nabsent from one another.  For the presence of friends makes us fastidious;\nand because we can at any time talk or sit together, when once we have\nparted we give not a thought to those whom we have just beheld.  And\nwe ought to bear the absence of friends cheerfully, just because everyone\nis bound to be often absent from his friends even when they are present.\nInclude among such cases, in the first place, the nights spent apart, then\nthe different engagements which each of two friends has, then the private\nstudies of each and their excursions into the country, and you will see\nthat foreign travel does not rob us of much.  A friend should be retained\nin the spirit; such a friend can never be absent.  He can see every\nday whomsoever he desires to see.\nI would therefore have you share your studies\nwith me, your meals, and your walks.  We should be living within too\nnarrow limits if anything were barred to our thoughts.  I see you,\nmy dear Lucilius,\n<Ep1-371>\nand at this very moment I hear you; I am with you to such an extent\nthat I hesitate whether I should not begin to write you notes instead of\nletters.  Farewell.\n~LVI+ ON QUIET AND STUDY\nBeshrew me if I think anything more requisite than\nsilence for a man who secludes himself in order to study!  Imagine\nwhat a variety of noises reverberates about my ears!  I have lodgings\nright over a bathing establishment.  So picture to yourself the assortment\nof sounds, which are strong enough to make me hate my very powers of hearing!\nWhen your strenuous gentleman, for example, is exercising himself by flourishing\nleaden weights; when he is working hard, or else pretends to be working\nhard, I can hear him grunt; and whenever he releases his imprisoned breath,\nI can hear him panting in wheezy and high-pitched tones.  Or perhaps\nI notice some lazy fellow, content with a cheap rubdown, and hear the crack\nof the pummeling hand on his shoulder, varying in sound according as the\nhand is laid on flat or hollow.  Then, perhaps, a professional/a comes\nalong, shouting out the score; that is the finishing touch.  Add to\nthis the arresting of an occasional roysterer or pickpocket, the racket\nof the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom,/b or\nthe enthusiast who plunges into the swimming-tank with unconscionable noise\nand splashing.  Besides all those whose voices, if nothing else, are\ngood, imagine the hair-plucker with his penetrating, shrill voice, - for\npurposes of advertisement, - continually giving it vent and never holding\n<Ep1-373>\nEPISTLE LVI.\nhis tongue except when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim\nyell instead.  Then the cakeseller with his varied cries, the sausageman,\nthe confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each\nwith his own distinctive intonation.\nSo you say: \" What iron nerves or deadened\nears, you must have, if your mind can hold out amid so many noises, so\nvarious and so discordant, when our friend Chrysippus/a is brought to his\ndeath by the continual good-morrows that greet him!\" But I assure you that\nthis racket means no more to me than the sound of waves Or falling water;\nalthough you will remind me that a certain tribe once moved their city\nmerely because they could not endure the din of a Nile cataract./b Words\nseem to distract me more than noises; for words demand attention, but noises\nmerely fill the ears and beat upon them.  Among the sounds that din\nround me without distracting, I include passing carriages, a machinist\nin the same block, a saw-sharpener near by, or some fellow who is demonstrating\nwith little pipes and flutes at the Trickling Fountain,/a shouting rather\nthan singing.\nFurthermore, an intermittent noise upsets\nme more than a steady one.  But by this time I have toughened my nerves\nagainst all that sort of thing, so that I can endure even a boatswain marking\nthe time in high-pitched tones for his cr\n<Ep1-375>\nEPISTLE LVI.\nthings outside itself; all outdoors may be bedlam, provided that there\nis no disturbance within, provided that fear is not wrangling with desire\nin my breast, provided that meanness and lavishness are not at odds, one\nharassing the other.  For of what benefit is a quiet neighbourhood,\nif our emotions are in an uproar?\n'Twas night, and all the world was lulled to rest./a\nThis is not true; for no real rest can be found\nwhen reason has not done the lulling.  Night brings our troubles to\nthe light, rather than banishes them; it merely changes the form of our\nworries. For even when we seek slumber, our sleepless moments are as harassing\nas the daytime.  Real tranquillity is the state reached by an unperverted\nmind when it is relaxed.  Think of the unfortunate man who courts\nsleep by surrendering his spacious mansion to silence, who, that his ear\nmay be disturbed by no sound, bids the whole retinue of his slaves be quiet\nand that whoever approaches him shall walk on tiptoe; he tosses from this\nside to that and seeks a fitful slumber amid his frettings!  He complains\nthat he has heard sounds, when he has not heard them at all.  The\nreason, you ask?  His soul's in an uproar; it must be soothed, and\nits rebellious murmuring checked. You need not suppose that the soul is\nat peace when the body is still. Sometimes quiet means disquiet.\nWe must therefore rouse ourselves to action and busy ourselves with interests\nthat are good, as often as we are in the grasp of an uncontrollable sluggishness.\nGreat generals, when they see that their men are mutinous, check them by\nsome sort of labour\n<Ep1-377>\nEPISTLE LVI.\nor keep them busy with small forays.  The much occupied man has\nno time for wantonness, and it is an obvious commonplace that the evils\nof leisure can be shaken off by hard work.  Although people may often\nhave thought that I sought seclusion because I was disgusted with politics\nand regretted my hapless and thankless position,/a yet, in the retreat\nto which apprehension and weariness have driven me, my ambition sometimes\ndevelops afresh.  For it is not because my anibition was rooted out\nthat it has abated, but because it was wearied or perhaps even put out\nof temper by the failure of its plans.  And so with luxury, also,\nwhich sometimes seems to have departed, and then when we have made a profession\nof frugality, begins to fret us and, amid our economies, seeks the pleasures\nwhich we have merely left but not condemned.  Indeed, the more stealthily\nit comes, the greater is its force.  For all unconcealed vices are\nless serious; a disease also is farther on the road to being cured when\nit breaks forth from concealment and manifests its power.  So with\ngreed, ambition, and the other evils of the mind, - you may be sure that\nthey do most harm when they are hidden behind a pretence of soundness.\nMen think that we are in retirement, and yet\nwe are not.  For if we have sincerely retired, and have sounded the\nsignal for retreat, and have scorned outward attractions, then, as I remarked\nabove,/b no outward thing will distract us; no music of men or of birds/c\ncan interrupt good thoughts, when they have once become steadfast and sure.\nThe mind which starts at words or at chance sounds is unstable and has\nnot yet withdrawn into itself; it contains within itself an element of\nanxiety and rooted fear,\n<Ep1-379>\nEPISTLE LVI.\nand this makes one a prey to care, as our Vergil says:\\\nI, whom of yore no dart could cause to flee,\nNor Greeks, with crowded lines of infantry.\nNow shake at every sound, and fear the air,\nBoth for my child and for the load I bear.\nThis man in his first state is wise; he blenches neither at the brandished\nspear, nor at the clashing armour of the serried foe, nor at the din of\nthe stricken city.  This man in his second state lacks knowledge fearing\nfor his own concerns, he pales at every sound; any cry is taken for the\nbattle-shout and overthrows him; the slightest disturbance renders him\nbreathless with fear.  It is the load that makes him afraid./b Select\nanyone you please from among your favourites of Fortune, trailing their\nmany responsibilities, carrying their many burdens, and you will behold\na picture of Vergil's hero, \"fearing both for his child and for the load\nhe bears.\"\nYou may therefore be sure that you are at peace with yourself,\nwhen no noise readies you, when no word shakes you out of yourself, whether\nit be of flattery or of threat, or merely an empty sound buzzing about\nyou with unmeaning din, \"What then?\" you say, \"is it not sometimes a simpler\nmatter just to avoid the uproar?\" I admit this.  Accordingly, I shall\nchange from my present quarters.  I merely wished to test myself and\nto give myself practice.  Why need I be tormented any longer, when\nUlysses found so simple a cure for his comrades/c even against the songs\nof the Sirens?  Farewell.\n<Ep1-381>\nEPISTLE LVII.\n~LVII+ ON THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL\nWhen it was time for me to return to Naples from Baiae, I easily persuaded\nmyself that a storm was raging, that I might avoid another trip by sea;\nand yet the road was so deep in mud, all the way, that I may be thought\nnone the less to have made a voyage.  On that day I had to endure\nthe full fate of an athlete; the enointing /a with which we began was followed\nby the sand- sprinkle in the Naples tunnel./b No place could be longer\nthan that prison; nothing could be dimmer than those torches, which enabled\nus, not to see amid the darkness, but to see the darkness.  But, even\nsupposing that there was light in the place, the dust, which is an oppressive\nand disagreeable thing even in the open air, would destroy the light; how\nmuch worse the dust is there, where it rolls back upon itself, and, being\nshut in without ventilation, blows back in the faces of those who set it\ngoing! So we endured two inconveniences at the same time, and they were\ndiametrically different: we struggled both with mud and with dust on the\nsame road and on the same day.\nThe gloom, however, furnished me with some\nfood for thought; I felt a certain mental thrill, and a transformation\nunaccompanied by fear, due to the novelty and the unpleasantness of an\nunusual occurrence.  Of course I am not speaking to you of myself\nat this point, because I am far from being a perfect person, or even a\nman of middling qualities; I refer to one over whom fortune has lost her\ncontrol.  Even such a man's mind will be smitten with a thrill and\n<Ep1-383>\nEPISTLE LVII.\nhe will change colour.  For there are ceratin emotions, my dear\nLucilius, which no courage can avoid; nature reminds courage how perishible\na thing it is.  And so he will contract his brow when the prospect\nis forbidding, will shudder at sudden apparitions, and will become dizzy\nwhen he stands at the edge of a high precipice and looks down.  This\nis not fear; it is a natural feeling which reason cannot rout.  That\nis why certain brave men, most willing to shed their own blood, cannot\nbear to see the blood of others. Some persons collapse and faint at the\nsight of a freshly inflicted wound; others are affected similarly on handling\nor viewing an old wound which is festering.  And others meet the sword-stroke\nmore readily than they see it dealt.\nAccordingly, as I said, I experienced a certain\ntransformation, though it could not be called confusion.  Then at\nthe first glimpse of restored daylight my good spirits returned without\nforethought or command.  And I began to muse and think how foolish\nwe are to fear certain objects to a greater or less degree, since all of\nthem end in the same way.  For what difference does it make whether\na watchtower or a mountain crashes down upon us?  No difference at\nall, you will find.  Nevertheless, there will be some men who fear\nthe latter mishap to a greater degree, though both accidents are equally\ndeadly; so true it is that fear looks not to the effect, but to the cause\nof the effect.  Do you suppose that I am now referring to the Stoics,/a\nwho hold that the soul of a man crushed by a great weight cannot abide,\nand is scattered forthwith, because it has not had a free opportunity to\ndepart?  That is not what I am doing; those who think thus are, in\nmy opinion, wrong.  Just as fire cannot be crushed out, since it\n<Ep1-385>\nEPISTLES LVII., LVIII.\nwill escape round the edges of the body which overwhelms it; just as\nthe air cannot be damaged by lashes and blows, or even cut into, but flows\nback about the object to which it gives place; similarly the soul, which\nconsists of the subtlest particles, cannot be arrested or destroyed inside\nthe body, but, by virtue of its delicate substance, it will rather escape\nthrough the very object by which it is being crushed.  Just as lightning,\nno matter how widely it strikes and flashes, makes its return through a\nnarrow opening/a, so the soul, which is still subtler than fire, has a\nway of escape through any part of the body.  We therefore come to\nthis question, - whether the soul can be immortal.  But be sure of\nthis: if the soul survives the body after the body is crushed, the soul\ncan in no wise be crushed out, precisely because it does not perish; for\nthe rule of immortality never admits of exceptions, and nothing can harm\nthat which is everlasting. Farewell.\n~LVIII+ ON BEING\nHow scant of words our language is, nay,how poverty- stricken,\nI have not fully understood until today.  We happened to be speaking\nof Plato, and a thousand subjects came up for discussion, which needed\nnames and yet possessed none; and there were certain others which once\npossessed, but have since lost, their words because we were too nice about\ntheir use. But who can endure to be nice in the midst of poverty?/b There\nis an insect, called\n<Ep1-387>\nEPISTLE, LVIII.\nby the Greeks oestrus,/a which drives cattle wild and scatters them\nall over their pasturing grounds; it used to be called asilus in our language,\nas you may believe on the authority of Vergil:-\nNear Silarus groves, and eke Alburnus' shades\nOf green-clad oak-trees\nflits an insect, named Asilus by the Romans; in the Greek The word is rendered\noestrus.  With a rough And strident sound it buzzes and drives wild\nThe terror-stricken herds throughout the woods./b By which I infer that\nthe word has gone out of use.  And, not to keep you waiting too long,\nthere were certain uncompounded words current, like cernere ferro inter\nse, as will be proved again by Vergil:-\nreat heroes, born in vrious lands, had come\nTo settle matters mutually with the sword./c\nThis \"settling matters\" we now express by decernere.\nThe plain word has become obsolete.  The ancients used to say iusso,\ninstead of iussero, in conditional clauses.  You need not take my\nword, but you may turn again to Vergil:-\nThe other soldiers shallconduct the fight\nWith me, where I shall bid./d\nIt is not iny purpose to show, by this array of\nexamples, how much time I have wasted on the study of language; I merely\nwish you to understand how many words, that were current in the works of\nEnnius and Accius, have become mouldy with age; while even in the case\nof Vergil, whose works are explored daily, some of his words have been\nfilched away from us.\nYou will say, I suppose: \"What is the purpose\nand meaning of this preamble?\" I shall not keep\n<Ep1-389>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nyou in the dark; I desire, if possible, to say the word essentia to\nyou and obtain a favourable hearing.  If I cannot do this, I shall\nrisk it even though it put you out of humour.  I have Cicero/a, as\nauthority for the use of this word, and I regard him as a powerful authority.\nIf you desire testimony of a later date, I shall cite Fabianus,/b careful\nof speech, cultivated, and so polished in style that he will suit even\nour nice tastes.  For what can we do, my dear Lucilius?  How\notherwise can we find a word for that which the Greeks call ov'o-t'a, something\nthat is indispensable, something that is the natural substratum of everything?\nI beg you accordingly to allow me to use this word essentia.  I shall\nnevertheless take pains to exercise the privilege, which you have granted\nme, with as sparing a hand as possible; perhaps I shall be content with\nthe mere right. Yet what good will your indulgence do me, if, lo and behold,\nI can in no wise express in Latin/c the meaning of the word which gave\nme the opportunity to rail at the poverty of our language?  And you\nwill condemn our narrow Roman limits even more, when you find out that\nthere is a word of one syllable which I cannot translate. \"What is this?\"\nyou ask.  It is the word Zv.  You think me lacking in facility;\nyou believe that the word is ready to hand, that it might be translated\nby quod est.  I notice, however, a great difference; you are forcing\nme to render a noun by a verb.  But if I must do so, I shall render\nit by quod est.  There are six ways/d in which Plato expresses this\nidea, according to a friend of ours, a man of great learning, who mentioned\nthe fact to-day.  And I shall explain all of them to you, if I may\nfirst point out that there is something called genus and something called\nspecies.\n<Ep1-391>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nFor the present, however, we are seeking the\nprimary idea of genus, on which the others,the different species, depend,\nwhich is the source of all classification, the term under which universal\nideas are embraced.  And the idea of genus will be reached if we begin\nto reckon back from particulars; for in this way we shall be conducted\nback to the primary notion.  Now \"man\" is a species, as Aristotle\na says; so is \"horse,\" or \"dog.\" We must therefore discover some common\nbond for all these terms, one which embraces them and holds them subordinate\nto itself. And what is this?  It is \"animal.\" And so there begins\nto be a genus \"animal,\" including all these terms, \"man,\" \"horse,\" and\n\"dog.\" But there are certain things which have life (anima) and yet are\nnot \"animals.\" For it is agreed that plants tnd trees possess life, and\nthat is why we speak of them as living and dying.  Therefore the term\n\"living things\" will occupy a still higher place, because both animals\nand plants are included in this category. Certain objects, however, lack\nlife, -such as rocks.  There will therefore be another term to take\nprecedence over \"living things,\" and that is \"substance.\" I shall classify\n\"substance \" by saying that all substances are either animate or inanimate.\nBut there is still something superior to \"substance\"; for we speak of certain\nthings as possessing substance, and certain things as lacking substance.\nWhat, then, will be the term from which these things are derived?\nIt is that to which we lately gave an inappropriate name, \"that which exists.\"\nFor by using this term they will be divided into species, so that we can\nsay: that which exists either possesses, or lacks, substance.\nThis, therefore, i\n<Ep1-393>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nOf course there are the other genera: but they are \"special\" genera:\n\"man \" being, for examples, a genus\".  For \"man\" comprises species:\nby nations, - Greek, Roman, Parthian; by colours, - white, black, yellow.\nThe term comprises individuals also:  Cato, Cicero, Lucretius.\nSo \"man\" falls into the category genus, in so far as it includes many kinds;\nbut in so far as it is subordinate to another term, it falls into the category\nspecies. But the genus \"that which exists\" is general, and has no term\nsuperior to it.  It is the first term in the classification of things,\nand all things are included under it.\nThe Stoics would set ahead of this still another\ngenus, even more primary; concerning which I shall immediately speak, after\nproving that the genus which has been discussed above, has rightly been\nplaced first, being, as it is, capable of including everything.  I\ntherefore distribute \"that which exists\" into these two species, - things\nwith, and things without, substance.  There is no third class.\nAnd how do I distribute \"substance\"?  By saying that it is either\nanimate or inanimate.  And how do I distribute the \"animate\"?\nBy saying: \"Certain things have mind, while others have only life.\" Or\nthe idea may be expressed as follows: \"Certain things have the power of\nmovement, of progress, of change of position, while others are rooted in\nthe ground; they are fed and they grow only through their roots.\" Again,\ninto what species do I divide \"animals\"?  They are either perishable\nor imperishable.  Certain of the Stoics regard the primary genus/a\nas the \"something.\" I shall add the reasons they give for their belief;\nthey say: \"in the order of nature some things exist, and other things do\nnot exist.  And even the things that do not exist are really part\nof the order of\n<Ep1-395>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nnature.  What these are will readily occur to the mind, for example\ncentaurs, giants, and all other figments of unsound reasoning, which have\nbegun to have a definite shape, although they have no bodily consistency.\"\nBut I now return to the subject which I promised\nto discuss for you, namely, how it is that Plato/a divides all existing\nthings in six different ways.  The first class of \"that which exists\"\ncannot be grasped by the sight or by the touch, or by any of the senses;\nbut it can be grasped by the thought.  Any generic conception, such\nas the generic idea \"man,\" does not come within the range of the eyes;\nbut \"man\" in particular does; as, for example, Cicero, Cato.  The\nterm \"animal\" is not seen; it is grasped by thought alone.  A particular\nanimal, however, is seen, for example, a horse, a dog.\nThe second class of \"things which exist,\"\naccording to Plato, is that which is prominent and stands out above everything\nelse; this, he says, exists in a preeminent degree./b The word \"poet\" is\nused indiscriminately, for this term is applied to all writers of verse;\nbut among the Greeks it has come to be the distinguishing mark of a single\nindividual.  You know that Homer is meant when you hear men say \"the\npoet.\" What, then, is this pre-eminent Being?  God, surely, one who\nis greater and more powerful than anyone else.  The third class is\nmade up of those things which exist in the proper sense of the term\\c;\nthey are countless in number, but are situated beyond our sight. \"What\nare these?\" you ask. They are Plato's own furniture, so to speak; he calls\nthem \"ideas,\" and from them all visible things are created, and according\nto their pattern all things are fashioned.\n<Ep1-397>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nThey are immortal, unchangeable, inviolable.  And this \"idea,\"\nor rather, Plato's conception of it,/a is as follows: \"The 'idea' is the\neverlasting pattern of those things which are created by natutre.\" I shall\nexplain this definition, in order lo set the subject before you in a clearer\nlight: Suppose that I wish to make a likeness of you; I possess in your\nown person the pattern of this picture, wherefrom my mind receives a certain\noutline, which it is to embody in its own handiwork.  That outward\nappearance, then, which gives me instruction and guidance, this pattern\nfor me to imitate, is the \"idea.\" Such patterns, therefore, nature possesses\nin infinite number, - of men, fish, trees, according to whose model everything\nthat nature has to create is worked out.\nIn the fourth place we shall put \"form.\"/b\nAnd if you would know what \"form\" means, you must pay close attention,\ncalling Plato, and not me, to account for the difficulty of the subject.\nHowever, we cannot make fine distinctions without encountering difficulties.\nA moment ago I made use of the artist as an illustration.  When the\nartist desired to reproduce Vergil in colours be would gaze upon Vergil\nhimself. The \"idea was Vergil's outward appearance, and this was the pattern\nof the intended work.  That which the artist draws from this \"idea\"\nand has embodied in his own work, is the \"form.\" Do you ask me where the\ndifference lies?  The formeris the pattern; while the latter is the\nshape taken from the pattern and embodied in the work.  Our artist\nfollows the one, but the other he creates.  A statue has a certain\nexternal appearance; this external appearance of the statue is the \"form.\"\nAnd the pattern/c itself has a certain external appearance, by gazing upon\nwhich the sculptor has fashioned his statue; this\n<Ep1-399>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nis the \"idea.\" If you desire a further distinction, I will say that\nthe \"form\" is in the artist's work, the \"idea\" outside his work, and not\nonly outside it, but prior to it.\nThe fifth class is made up of the things which\nexist in the usual sense of the term.  These things are the first\nthat have to do with us; here we have all such things as men, cattle, and\nthings. In the sixth class goes all that which has a fictitious existence,\nlike void, or time.\nWhatever is concrete to the sight or touch,\nPlato does not include among the things which he believes to be existent\nin the strict sense of the term.  These things are the first that\nhav e to do with us: here we have all such things as men, cattle, and things.\nFor they are in a state of flux, constantly diminishing or increasing.\nNone of us is the same man in old age that he was in youth; nor the same\non the morrow as on the day preceding.  Our bodies are burned along\nlike flowing waters; every visible object accompanies time in its flight;\nof the things which we see, nothing is fixed.  Even I myself as I\ncomment on this change, am changed myself.  This is just what Heraclitus/b\nsays: \"We go down twice into the same river, and yet into a different river.\"\nFor the stream still keeps the same name, but the water has already flowed\npast.  Of course this is much more evident in rivers than in human\nbeings. Still, we mortals are also carried past in no less speedy a course;\nand this prompts me to marvel at our madness in cleaving with great affection\nto such a fleeting thing as the body, and in fearing lest some day we may\ndie, when every instant means the death of our previous condition./c Will\nyou not stop fearing lest that may happen once which really happens every\nday?  So much for man, - a substance that flows away and falls, exposed\nto every influence; but the universe,\n<Ep1-401>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\ntoo, immortal and enduring as it is, changes and never remains the same.\nFor though it has within itself all that it has had, it has it in a different\nway from that in which it has had it; it keeps changing its arrangement.\n,\"Very well,\" say you, \"what good shall I get from all this fine reasoning?\"\nNone, if you wish me to answer your question.  Nevertheless, just\nas an engraver rests his eyes when they have long been under a strain and\nare weary, and calls them from their work, and \"feasts\" them, as the saying\nis; so we at times should slacken our minds and refresh them with some\nsort of entertainment.  But let even your entertainment be work; and\neven from these various forms of entertainment you will select, if you\nhave been watchful, something that may prove wholesome.  That is my\nhabit, Lucilius: I try to extract and render useful some element from every\nfield of thought, no matter how far removed it may be from philosophy.\nNow what could be less likely to reform character than the subjects which\nwe have been discussing? And how can I be made a better man by the \"ideas\"\nof Plato?  What can I draw from them that will put a check on my appetites?\nPerhaps the very thought, that all these things which minister to our senses,\nwhich arouse and excite us, are by Plato denied a place among the things\nthat really exist.  Such things are therefore imaginary, and though\nthey for the moment present a certain external appearance, yet they are\nin no case permanent or substantial; none the less, we crave them as if\nthey were always to exist, or as if we were always to possess them.\nWe are weak, watery beings standing in the\nmidst of unrealities; therefore let us turn our minds to the\n<Ep1-403>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nthings that are everlasting.  Let us look up to the ideal outlines\nof all things, that flit about on high, and to the God who moves among\nthem and plans how he may defend from death that which he could not make\nimperishable because its substance forbade, and so by reason may overcome\nthe defects of the body.  For all things abide, not because they are\neverlasting, but because they are protected by the care of him who governs\nall things; but that which was imperishable would need no guardian.\nThe Master Builder keeps them safe, overcoming the weakness of their fabric\nby own power. Let us despise everything that is so little an object of\nvalue that it makes us doubt whether it exists at all.  Let us at\nthe same time reflect, seeing that Providence rescues from its perils the\nworld itself, which is no less mortal than we ourselves, that to some extent\nour petty bodies can be made to tarry longer upon earth by our own\nprovidence+, if only we acquire the ability to control and check those\npleasures whereby the greater portion of mankind perishes.  Plato\nhimself, by taking pains, advanced to old age.  To be sure, he was\nthe fortunate possessor of a strong and sound body (his very name was given\nhim because of his broad chest/a); but his strength was much impaired by\nsea voyages and desperate adventures. Nevertheless, by frugal living, by\nsetting a limit upon all that rouses the appetites+,\nand by painstaking attention to himself, he reached that advanced age in\nspite of many hindrances.  You know, I am sure, that Plato had the\ngood fortune, thanks to his careful living, to die on his birthday, after\nexactly completing his eighty-first year.  For this reason wise men\nof the East, who happened to be in Athens at that time, sacrificed to\n<Ep1-405>\nEPISTLE LVIII.\nhim after his death, believing that his length of days was too full\nfor a mortal man, since he had rounded out the perfect number of nine times\nnine.  I do not doubt that he would have been quite willing to forgo\na few days from this total, as well as the sacrifice.\nFrugal living can bring one to old age; and\nto my mind old age is not to be refused any more than is to be craved.\nThere is a pleasure in being in one's own company as long as possible,\nwhen a man has made himself worth enjoying.  The question, therefore,\non which we have to record our judgment is, whether one should shrink from\nextreme old age and should hasten the end artificially, instead of waiting\nfor it to come.  A man who sluggishly awaits his fate is almost a\ncoward,{Hamlet+}\njust as he is immoderately given to wine who drains the jar dry and sucks\nup even the dregs.  But we shall ask this question also: \"Is the extremity\nof life the dregs, or is it the clearest and purest part of all, provided\nonly that the mind is unimpaired, and the senses, still sound, give their\nsupport to the spirit, and the body is not worn out and dead before its\ntime?\" For it makes a great deal of difference whether a man is lengthening\nhis life or his death.  But if the body is useless for service, why\nshould one not free the struggling soul?  Perhaps one ought to do\nthis a little before the debt is due, lest, when it falls due, he may be\nunable to perform the act.  And since the danger of living in wretchedness\nis greater than the danger of dying soon, he is a fool who refuses to stake\na little time and win a hazard+ of great\ngain./a {suicide+} Few have lasted\nthrough extreme old age to death without impairment, and many have lain\ninert, making. no use of themselves.  How much more\n<Ep1-407>\nEPISTLES LVIII., LIX.\ncruel, then, do you suppose it really is to have lost a portion of your\nlife, than to have lost your right to end that life?  Do not hear\nme with reluctance, as if my statement applied directly to you, but weigh\nwhat I have to say.  It is this, that I shall not abandon old age,\nif old age preserves me intact for myself, and intact as regards the better\npart of myself; but if old age begins to shatter my mind, and to pull its\nvarious faculties to pieces, if it leaves me, not life, but only the breath\nof life, I shall rush out of a house that is crumbling and tottering.\nI shall not avoid illness by seeking death, as long as the illness is curable\nand does not impede my soul.  I shall not lay violent hands upon myself\njust because I am in pain; for death under such circumstances is defeat.\nBut if I find out that the pain must always be endured, I shall depart,\nnot because of the pain but because it will be a hindrance to me as regards\nall my reasons for living.  He who dies just because he is in pain\nis a weakling, a coward; but he who lives merely to brave out this pain,\nis a fool.\nBut I am running on too long; and, besides,\nthere is matter here to fill a day.  And how can a man end his life,\nif he cannot end a letter?  So farewell.  This last word/a you\nwill read with greater pleasure than all my deadly talk about death.\nFarewell.\n~LIX+ ON PLEASURE AND JOY\nI received great pleasure from your letter; kindly\nallow me to use these words in their everyday meaning, without insisting\nupon their Stoic import.  For we Stoics hold that pleasure is a vice.\nVery likely it is a vice; but we are accustomed to use\n<Ep1-409>\nEPISTLE LIX,\nthe word when we wish to indicate a happy state of mind.  I am\naware that if we test words by our formula,/a even pleasure is a thiing\nof ill repute, and joy can be attained only by the wise.  For \"joy\"\nis an elation of spirit, of a spirit which trusts in the goodness and truth\nof its own possessions.  The common usage, however, is that we derive\ngreat \"joy\" from a friend's position as consul, or from his marriage, or\nfrom the birth of his child; but these events, so far from being matters\nof joy, are more often the beginnings of sorrow to come.  No, it is\na characteristic of real joy that it never ceases, and never changes into\nits opposite./b\nAccordingly, when our Vergil speaks of The\nevil joys of the mind,/c his words are eloquent, but not strictly appropriate.\nFor no \"joy\" can be evil.  He bas given the name \"joy\" to pleasures,\nand has thus expressed his meaning.  For he has conveyed the idea\nthat men take delight in their own evil.  Nevertheless, I was not\nwrong in sayilng that I received great \"pleasure\" from your letter; for\nalthough an ignorant/d man may derive \"joy\" if the cause be an honourable\none, yet, since his emotion is wayward, and is likely soon to take another\ndirection, I call it \"pleasure\"; for it is inspired by an opinion concerning\na spurious good; it exceeds control and is carried to excess.\nBut, to return to the subject, let me tell\nyou what delighted me in your letter.  You have your words under control.\nYou are not carried away by your language, or borne beyond the limits which\nyou have determined upon.  Many writers are tempted by the charm of\nsome alluring phrase to some topic\n<Ep1-411>\nEPISTLE LIX.\nother than that which they had set themselves to discuss.  But\nthis has not been so in your case; all your words are compact, and suited\nto the subject, You say all that you wish, and you mean still more than\nyou say. This is a proof of the importance of your subject matter, showing\nthat your mind, as well as your words, contains nothing superfluous or\nbombastic.\nI do, however,/a find some metaphors, not,\nindeed, daring ones, but the kind which have stood the test of use.\nI find similes also; of course, if anyone forbids us to use them, maintaining\nthat poets alone have that privilege, he has not, apparently, read any\nof our ancient prose writers, who had not yet learned to affect a style\nthat should win applause.  For those writers, whose eloquence was\nsimple and directed only towards proving their case, are full of comparisons;\nand I think that these are necessary, not for the same reason which makes\nthem necessary for the poets, but in order that they may serve as props\nto our feebleness, to bring both speaker and listener face to face with\nthe subject under discussion.  For example, I am at this very moment\nreading Sextius/b; he is a keen man, and a philosopher who, though he writes\nin Greek, has the Roman standard of ethics.  One of his similes appealed\nespecially to me, that of an army marching in hollow square,/c in a place\nwhere the enemy might be expected to appear from any quarter, ready for\nbattle. \"This,\" said he, \"is just what the wise man ought to do; he should\nhave all his fighting qualities deployed on every side, so that wherever\nthe attack threatens, there his supports may be ready to hand and may obey\nthe captain's command without confusion.\" This is what we notice in armies\nwhich serve\n<Ep1-413>\nEPISTLE LIX.\nunder great leaders; we see how all the troops simultaneously understand\ntheir general's orders, since they are so arranged that a signal given\nby one man passes down the ranks of cavalry and infantry at the same moment.\nThis, he declares, is still more necessary for men like ourselves; for\nsoldiers have often feared an enemy without reason, and the march which\nthey thought most dangerous has in fact been most secure; but folly brings\nno repose, fear haunts it both in the van and in the rear of the column,\nand both flanks are in a panic.  Folly is pursued, and confronted,\nby peril. It blenches at everything; it is unprepared; it is frightened\neven by auxiliary troops./a But the wise man is fortified against all inroads;\nhe is alert; he will not retreat before the attack of poverty, or of sorrow,\nor of disgrace, or of pain.  He will walk undaunted both against them\nand among them.\nWe human beings are fettered and weakened\nby many vices; we have wallowed in them for a long time and it is hard\nfor us to be cleansed.  We are not merely defiled; we are dyed by\nthem. But, to refrain from passing from one figure/b to another, I will\nraise this question, which I often consider in my own heart: why is it\nthat folly holds us with such an insistent grasp?  It is, primarily,\nbecause we do not combat it strongly enough, because we do not struggle\ntowards salvation with all our might; secondly, because we do not put sufficient\ntrust in the discoveries of the wise, and do not drink in their words with\nopen hearts; we approach this great problem in too trifling a spirit.\nBut how can a man learn, in the struggle against his vices, an amount that\nis enough, if the time which he gives to learning is only the amount left\nover from his vices?\n<Ep1-415>\nEPISTLE LIX.\nNone of us goes deep below the surface.  We skim the top only,\nand we regard the smattering of time spent in the search for wisdom as\nenough and to spare for a busy man.  What hinders us most of all is\nthat we are too readily satisfied with ourselves; if we meet with someone\nwho calls us good men, or sensible men, or holy men, we see ourselves in\nhis description, not content with praise in moderation, we accept everything\nthat shamelessflattery+ heaps upon us,\nas if it were our due.  We agree with those who declare us to be the\nbest and wisest of men, although we know that they are given to much lying.\nAnd we are so self- complacent that we desire praise for certain actions\nwhen we are especially addicted to the very opposite.  Yonder person\nhears himself called \"most gentle\" when he is inflicting tortures, or \"most\ngenerous\" when he is engaged in looting, or \"most temperate\" when he is\nin the midst of drunkenness and lust.  Thus it follows that we are\nunwilling to be reformed, just because we believe ourselves to be the best\nof men.\nAlexander was roaming as far as India, ravaging\ntribes that were but little known, even to their neighbours.  During\nthe blockade of a certain city., while he was reconnoitring the walls and\nhunting for the weakest spot in the fortifications, he was wounded by an\narrow. Nevertheless, he long continued the siege, intent on finishing what\nhe had begun.  The pain of his wound, however, as the surface became\ndry and as the flow of blood was checked, increased; his leg gradually\nbecame numb as he sat his horse; and finally, when he was foreed to withdraw,\nhe exclaimed: \"All men swear that I am the son of Jupiter, but this wound\ncries out that I am mortal+.\" \" Let us also\nact in the same way.\n<Ep1-417>\nEPISTLE LIX.\nEach man, according to his lot in life, is stultified by flattery.\nWe should say to him who flatters us: \"You call me a man of sense, but\nI understand how many of the things which I crave are useless, and how\nmany of the things which I desire will do me harm.  I have not even\nthe knowledge, which satiety teaches to animals, of what should be the\nmeasure of my food or my drink. I do not yet know how much I can hold.\"\nI shall now show you how you may know that\nyou are not wise.  The wise man is joyful, happy and calm, unshaken,\nhe lives on a plane with the gods.  Now go, question yourself; if\nyou are never downcast, if your mind is not harassed by my apprehension,\nthrough anticipation of what is to come, if day and night your soul keeps\non its even and unswerving course, upright and content with itself, then\nyou have attained to the greatest good that mortals can possess.\nIf, however, you seek pleasures of all kinds in all directions, you must\nknow that you are as far short of wisdom as you are short of joy.\nJoy is the goal which you desire to reach, but you are wandering from the\npath, if you expect to reach your goal while you are in the midst of riches\nand official titles, - in other words, if you seek joy in the midst of\ncares, These objects for which you strive so eagerly, as if they would\ngive you happiness and pleasure, are merely causes of grief.\nAll men of this stamp, I maintain, are pressing\non in pursuit of joy, but they do not know where they may obtain a joy\nthat is both great and enduring.  One person seeks it in feasting\nand self-indulgence; another, in canvassing for honours and in being surrounded\nby a throng of clients; another, in his mistress; another, in idle display\nof culture and in\n<Ep1-419>\nEPISTLE LIX.\nliterature that has no power to heal; all these men are led astray by\ndelights which are deceptive and short-lived - like drunkenness for example,\nwhich pays for a single hour of hilarious madness by a sickness of many\ndays, or like applause and the popularity of enthusiastic approval which\nare gained, and atoned for, at the cost of great mental disquietude.\nReflect, therefore, on this, that the effect\nof wisdom is a joy that is unbroken and continuous./a The mind of the wise\nman is like the ultra-lunar firmament/b; eternal calm pervades that region.\nYou have, then, a reason for wishing to be wise, if the wise man is never\ndeprived of joy.  This joy springs only from the knowledge that you\npossess the virtues.  None but the brave, the just, the self-restrained,\ncan rejoice. And when you query: \"What do you mean?  Do not the foolish\nand the wicked also rejoice?\" I reply, no more than lions who have caught\ntheir prey. When men have wearied themselves with wine and lust, when night\nfails them before their debauch is done, when the pleasures which they\nhave heaped upon a body that is too small to hold them begin to fester,\nat such times they utter in their wretchedness those lines of Vergil/c:\nThou knowest how, amid false-glittering joys.\nWe spent that last of nights.\nPleasure-lovers spend every night amid false-glittering\njoys, and just as if it were their last.  But the joy which comes\nto the gods, and to those who imitate the gods, is not broken off, nor\ndoes it cease; but it would surely cease were it borrowed\n<Ep1-421>\nEPISTLES LIX., LX.\nfrom without.  Just because it is not in the power of another to\nbestow, neither is it subject to another's whims.  That which Fortune\nhas not given, she cannot take away.  Farewell.\n~LX+ ON HARMFUL PRAYERS\nI file a complaint, I enter a suit, I am angry.\nDo you still desire what your nurse, your guardian, or your mother, have\nprayed for in your behalf?  Do you not yet understand what evil they\nprayed for? Alas, how hostile to us are the wishes of our own folk!\nAnd they are all the more hostile in proportion as they are more completely\nfulfilled.  It is no surprise to me, at my age, that nothing but evil\nattends us from our early youth; for we have grown up amid the curses invoked\nby our parents. And may the gods give ear to our cry also, uttered in our\nown behalf, - one which asks no favours!\nHow long shall we go on making demands upon\nthe gods, as if we were still unable to support ourselves?  How long\nshall we continue to fill with grain the market-places of our great cities?\nHow long must the people gather it in for us?  How long shall many\nships convey the requisites for a single meal, bringing them from no single\nsea?  The bull is filled when he feeds over a few acres; and one forest\nis large enough for a herd of elephants.  Man, however, draws sustenance\nboth from the earth and from the sea.  What, then?  Did nature\ngive us bellies so insatiable, when she gave us these puny bodies, that\nwe should outdo the hugest and most voracious animals in greed?  Not\nat all.  How small is the amount which will satisfy nature?\nA very\n<Ep1-423>\nEPISTLES LX., LXI.\nlittle will send her away contented.  It is not the natural hunger\nof our bellies that costs us dear, but our solicitous cravings.  Therefore\nthose who, as Sallust/a puts it, \"hearken to their bellies,\" should be\nnumbered among the animals, and not among men; and certain men, indeed,\nshould be numbered, not even among the animals, but among the dead.\nHe really lives who is made use of by many; he really lives who makes use\nof himself.  Those men, however, who creep into a hole and grow torpid/b\nare no better off in their homes than if they were in their tombs. {retirement+}\nRight there on the marble lintel of the house of such a man you may inscribe\nhis name,/c for he has died before he is dead.  Farewell.\n~LXI+ ON MEETING DEATH CHEERFULLY\nLet us cease to desire that which we have been\ndesiring.  I, at least, am doing this: in my old age I have ceased\nto desire what I desired when a boy.  To this single end my days and\nmy nights are passed; this is my task, this the object of my thoughts,\n- to put an end to my chronic ills.  I am endeavouring to live every\nday as if it were a complete life.  I do not indeed snatch it up as\nif it were my last; I do regard it, however, as if it might even be my\nlast.  The present letter is written to you with this in mind as if\ndeath were about to call me away in the very act of writing.  I am\nready to depart, and I shall enjoy life just because I am not over-anxious\nas to the future date of my departure.\nBefore I became old I tried to live well;\nnow that I am old, I shall try to die well; but dying\n<Ep1-425>\nEPISTLES LXI., LXII.\nwell means dying gladly.  See to it that you never do anything\nunwillingly: That which is bound to be a necessity if you rebel, is not\na necessity if you desire it.  This is what I mean: he who takes his\norders gladly, escapes the bitterest part of slavery, - doing what one\ndoes not want to do.  The man who does something under orders is not\nunhappy; he is unhappy who does something against his will.  Let us\ntherefore so set our minds in order that we may desire whatever is demanded\nof us by circumstances, and above all that we may reflect upon our end\nwithout sadness.  We must make ready for death before we make ready\nfor life.  Life is well enough fumished, but we are too greedy with\nregard to its furnishings; something always seems to us lacking, and will\nalways seem lacking.  To have lived long enough depends neither upon\nour years nor upon our days, but upon our minds.  I have lived, my\ndear friend Lucilius, long enough.  I have had my fill.  I await\ndeath.  Farewell.\n~LXII+ ON GOOD COMPANY\nWe are deceived by those who would have us believe that\na multitude of affairs blocks their pursuit of liberal\nstudies+; they make a pretence of their engagements, and multiply them,\nwhen their engagements are merely with themselves.  As for me, Lucilius,\nmy time is free; it is indeed free, and wherever I am, I am master of mysel.\nFor I do not surrender myself to my affairs+,\nbut loan myself to them, and I do not hunt out excuses for wasting my time.\nAnd\n<Ep1-427>\nEPISTLES LXII., LXIII.\nwholesome thought.  When I give myself to my friends, I do not\nwithdraw from my own company, nor do I linger with those who are associated\nwith me through some special occasion or some case which arises from my\nofficial position.  But I spend my time in the company of all the\nbest; no matter in what lands they may have lived, or in what age, I let\nmy thoughts fly to them.  Demetrius,/a for instance, the best of men,\nI take about with me, and, leaving the wearers of purple and fine linen,\nI talk with him, half-naked as he is, and hold him in high esteem.\nWhy should I not hold him in high esteem?  I have found that he lacks\nnothing.  It is in the power of any man to despise all things, but\nof no man to possess all things. The shortest cut to riches is to despise\nriches.  Our friend Demetrius, however, lives not merely as if he\nhas learned to despise all things, but as if he has handed them over for\nothers to possess./b Farewell.\n~LXIII+ ON GRIEF FOR LOST FRIENDS\nI am grieved to hear that your friend Flaccus\nis dead, but I would not have you sorrow more than is fitting.  That\nyou should not mourn at all I shall hardly dare to insist; and yet I know\nthat it is the better way.  But what man will ever be so blessed with\nthat ideal steadfastness of soul, unless he has already risen far above\nthe reach of Fortune?  Even such a man will be stung by an event like\nthis, but it will be only a sting.  We, however, may be forgiven for\nbursting into tears, if only our tears have not flowed to excess, and if\nwe ha\n<Ep1-429>\nEPISTLE LXIII.\nwe have lost a friend, nor let them overflow.  We may weep, but\nwe must not wail.\nDo you think that the law which I lay down\nfor you is harsh, when the greatest of Greek poets has extended the privilege\nof weeping to one day only, in the lines where he tells us that even Niobe\ntook thought of food/a?  Do you wish to know the reason for lamentations\nand excessive weeping?  It is because we seek the proofs of our bereavement\nin our tears, and do not give way to sorrow, but merely parade it.\nNo man goes into mourning for his own sake.  Shame on our ill-timed\nfolly!  There is an element of self-seeking even in our sorrow.\n\"What,\" you say, \"am I to forget my friend?\nIt is surely a short-lived memory that you vouchsafe to him, if it is to\nendure only as long as your grief; presently that brow of yours will be\nsmoothed out in laughter by some circumstance, however casual.  It\nis to a time no more distant than this that I put off the soothing of every\nregret, the quieting of even the bitterest grief.  As soon as you\ncease to observe yourself, the picture of sorrow which you have contemplated\nwill fade away; at present you are keeping watch over your own suffering.\nBut even while you keep watch it slips away from you, and the sharper it\nis, the more speedily it comes to an end.\nLet us see to it that the recollection of\nthose whom we have lost becomes a pleasant memory to us.  No man reverts\nwith pleasure to any subject which he will not be able to reflect upon\nwithout pain.  So too it cannot but be that the names of those whom\nwe have loved and lost come back to us with a sort of sting; but there\nis a pleasure even in this sting.  For, as my friend Attalus/b used\nto say: \"The remembrance of lost friends is pleasant in the same\n<Ep1-431>\nEPISTLE LXIII.\nway that certain fruits have an agreeably acid taste, or as in extremely\nold wines it is their very bitterness that pleases us.  Indeed, after\na certain lapse of time, every thought that gave pain is quenched, and\nthe pleasure comes to us unalloyed.\" If we take the word of Attalus for\nit, \"to think of friends who are alive and well is like enjoying a meal\nof cakes and honey; the recollection of friends who have passed away gives\na pleasure that is not without a touch of bitterness.  Yet who will\ndeny that even these things, which are bitter and contain an clement of\nsourness, do serve to arouse the stomach?\" For my part, I do not agree\nwith him. To me, the thought of my dead friends is sweet and appealing.\nFor I have had them as if I should one day lose them; I have lost them\nas if I have them still.\nTherefore, Lucilius, act as befits your own\nserenity of mind, and cease to put a wrong interpretation on the gifts\nof Fortune.  Fortune has taken away, but Fortune has given.\nLet us greedily enjoy our friends, because we do not know how long this\nprivilege will be ours.  Let us think how often we shall leave them\nwhen we go upon distant journeys, and how often we shall fail to see them\nwhen we tarry together in the same place; we shall thus understand that\nwe have lost too much of their time while they were alive.  But will\nyou tolerate men who are most careless of their friends, and then mourn\nthem most abjectly, and do not love anyone unless they have lost him?\nThe reason why they lament too unrestrainedly at such times is that they\nare afraid lest men doubt whether they really have loved; all too late\nthey seek for proofs of their emotions.  If we have other friends,\nwe surely deserve ill at their hands and think ill of them, if\n<Ep1-433>\nEPISTLE LXIII.\nthey are of so little account that they fail to console us for the loss\nof one.  If, on the other hand, we have no other friends, we have\ninjured ourselves more than Fortune has injured us; since Fortune has robbed\nus of one friend, but we have robbed ourselves of every friend whom we\nhave failed to make.  Again, he who has been unable to love more than\none, has had none too much love even for that one./a If a man who has lost\nhis one and only tunic through robbery chooses to bewail his plight rather\nthan look about him for some way to escape the cold, or for something with\nwhich to cover his shoulders, would you not think him an utter fool?\nYou nave buried one whom you loved; look about\nfor someone to love.  It is better to replace your friend than to\nweep for him.  What I am about to add is, I know, a very hackneyed\nremark, but I shall not omit it simply because it is a common phrase: a\nman ends his grief by the mere passing of time, even if he has not ended\nit of his own accord.  But the most shameful cure for sorrow, in the\ncase of a sensible man, is to grow weary of sorrowing.  I should prefer\nyou to abandon grief, rather than have grief abandon you; and you should\nstop grieving as soon as possible, since, even if you wish to do so, it\nis impossible to keep it up for a long time.  Our forefathers/b have\nenacted that, in the case of women, a year should be the limit for mourning;\nnot that they needed to mourn for so long, but that they should mourn no\nlonger.  In the case of men, no rules are laid down, because to mourn\nat all is not regarded as honourable.  For all that, what woman can\nyou show me, of all the pathetic females that could scarcely be dragged\naway from the funeral-pile or torn from the corpse, whose tears have lasted\na whole month?\n<Ep1-435>\nEPISTLE LXIII.\nNothing becomes offensive so quickly as grief; when fresh, it finds\nsomeone to console it and attracts one or another to itself; but after\nbecoming chronic, it is ridiculed, and rightly.  For it is either\nassumed or foolish.\nHe who writes these words to you is no other\nthan I, who wept so excessively for my dear friend Annaeus Serenus/a that,\nin spite of my wishes, I must be included among the examples of men who\nhave been overcome by grief.  To-day, however, I condemn this act\nof mine, and I understand that the reason why I lamented so greatly was\nchiefly that I had never imagined it possible for his death to precede\nmine.  The only thought which occurred to my mind was that he was\nthe younger, and much younger, too, - as if the Fates kept to the order\nof our ages!\nTherefore let us continually think as much\nabout our own mortality as about that of all those we love.  In former\ndays I ought to have said: \"My friend Serenus is younger than I; but what\ndoes that matter?  He would naturally die after me, but he may precede\nme.\" It was just because I did not do this that I was unprepared when Fortune\ndealt me the sudden blow.  Now is the time for you to reflect, not\nonly that all things are mortal, but also that their mortality is subject\nto no fixed law.  Whatever can happen at any time can happen to-day. {Murphy+}\nLet us therefore reflect, my beloved Lucilius, that we shall soon come\nto the goal which this friend, to our own sorrow, has reached.  And\nperhaps, if only the tale told by wise men is true/b and there is a bourne\nto welcome us, then he whom we think we have lost has only been sent on\nahead.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-437>\nEPISTLE LXIV.\n~LXIV+ ON THE PHILOSOPHER'S TASK\nYesterday you were with us.  You might\ncomplain if I said \"yesterday\" merely.  This is why I have added \"with\nus.\" For, so far as I am concerned, you are always with me.  Certain\nfriends had happened in, on whose account a somewhat brighter fire was\nlaid, - not the kind that generally bursts from the kitchen chimneys of\nthe rich and scares the watch, but the moderate blaze which means that\nguests have come.  Our talk ran on various themes, as is natural at\na dinner; it pursued no chain of thought to the end, but jumped from one\ntopic to another.  We then had read to us a book by Quintus Sextius\nthe Elder./a He is a great man, if you have any confidence in my opinion,\nand a real Stoic, though he himself denies it.  Ye Gods, what strength\nand spirit one finds in him!  This is not the case with all philosophers;\nthere are some men of illustrious name whose writings are sapless.\nThey lay down rules, they argue, and they quibble; they do not infuse spirit\nsimply because they have no spirit.  But when you come to read Sextius\nyou will say: \"He is alive; he is strong; he is free; he is more than a\nman; he fills me with a mighty confidence before I close his book.\" I shall\nacknowledge to you the state of mind I am in when I read his works:\nI want to challenge every hazard; I want to cry: \"Why keep me waiting,\nFortune?  Enter the lists!  Behold, I am ready for you!\" {Hamlet+} {Bassanio+}\nI assume the spirit of a man who seeks where h e may make trial of himself\nwhere he may show his\n<Ep1-439>\nEPISTLE LXIV.\nAnd fretting 'mid the unwarlike flocks he prays\nSome foam-flecked boar may cross his path, or else\nA tawny lion stalking down the hills./a\nI want something to overcome, something on which I may test my endurance.\nFor this is another remarkable quality that Sextius possesses: he will\nshow you the grandeur of the happy life and yet will not make you des pair\nof attaining it; you will undederstand that it is on high, but that it\nis aceessible to him who has the will to seek it.\nAnd virtue herself will have the same effect\nupon you, of making you admire her and yet hope to attain her.  In\nmy own case, at any rate the very contemplation of wisdom takes much of\nmy time; I gaze upon her with bewilderment, just as I sometimes gaze upon\nthe firmament itself, which I often behold as if I saw it for the first\ntime.  Hence I worship the discoveries of wisdom and their discoverers;\nto enter, as it were, into the inheritance of many predecessors is a delight.\nIt was for me that they laid up this treasure; it was for me that they\ntoiled.  But we should play the part of a careful householder; we\nshould increase what we have inherited.  This inheritance shall pass\nfrom me to my descendants larger than before.  Much still remains\nto do, and much will always remain, and he who shall be born a thousand\nages hence will not be barred from his opporttinitv of adding something\nfurther.  But even if the old masters have discovered everything,\none thing will be always new, - the application and the scientific study\nand classification of the discoveries made by others.  Assume that\nprescriptions have been handed down to us for the healing of the eyes;\nthere is no need of my searching for others in addition; but\n<Ep1-441>\nEPISTLE LXIV.\nfor all that, these prescriptions must be adapted to the particular\ndisease and to the particular stage of the disease.  Use this prescription\nto relieve granulation of the eyelids, that to reduce the swelling of the\nlids, this to prevent sudden pain or a rush of tears, that to sharpen the\nvision.  Then compound these several prescriptions, watch for the\nright time of their application, and supply the proper treatment in each\ncase.\nThe cures for the spirit also have been discovered\nby the ancients; but it is our task to learn the method and the time of\ntreatment.  Our predecessors have worked much improvement, but have\nnot worked out the problem.  They deserve respect, however, and should\nbe worshipped with a divine ritual.  Why should I not keep statues\nof great men to kindle my enthusiasm, and celebrate their birthdays?\nWhy should I not continually greet them with respect and honour?\nThe reverence which I owe to my own teachers I owe in like measure to those\nteachers of the human race, the source from which the beginnings of such\ngreat blessings have flowed.  If I meet a consul or a praetor, I shall\npay him all the honour which his post of honour is wont to receive:\nI shall dismount, uncover, and yield the road.  What, then?\nShall I admit into my soul with less than the highest marks of respect\nMarcus Cato, the Elder and the Younger, Laelius the Wise, Socrates and\nPlato, Zeno and Cleanthes?  I worship them in very truth, and always\nrise to do honour to such noble names.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-443>\nEPISTLE LXV.\n~LXV+ ON THE FIRST CAUSE\nI shared my time yesterday with ill health/a; it\nclaimed for itself all the period before noon; in the afternoon, however,\nit yielded to me.  And so I first tested my spirit by reading; then,\nwhen reading was found to be possible, I dared to make more demands upon\nthe spirit, or perhaps I should say, to make more concessions to it.\nI wrote a little, and indeed with more concentration than usual, for I\nam struggling with a difficult subject and do not wish to be downed.\nIn the midst of this, some friends visited me, with the purpose of employing\nforce and of restraining me, as if I were a sick man indulging in some\nexcess.  So conversation was substituted for writing; and from this\nconversation I shall communicate to you the topic which is still the subject\nof debate; for we have appointed you referee./b You have more of a task\non your hands than you suppose, for the argument is threefold.\nOur Stoic philosophers, as you know, declare\nthat there are two things in the universe which are the source of everything,\n- namely, cause and matter./c Matter lies sluggish, a substance ready for\nany use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion.\nCause, however, by which we mean reason, moulds matter and turns it in\nwhatever direction it will, producing thereby various concrete results.\nAccordingly, there must be, in the case of each thing, that from which\nit is made, and, next, an agent by which it is made.  The former is\nits material, the latter its cause.\nAll art is but imitation of nature; therefore,\nlet me apply these statements of general principles to\n<Ep1-445>\nEPISTLE LXV.\nthe things which have to be made by man.  A statue, for example,\nhas afforded matter which was to undergo treatment at the hands of the\nartist, and has had an artist who was to give form to the matter.\nHence, in the case of the statue, the material was bronze, the cause was\nthe workman. And so it goes with all things, - they consist of that which\nis made and of the maker.  The Stoics believe in one cause only -\nthe maker; but Aristotle thinks that the word \"cause\" can be used in three\nways: \"The first cause,\" he says, \"is the actual matter, without which\nnothing can be created.  The second is the workman.  The third\nis the form, which is impressed upon every work, - a statue, for example.\"\nThis last is what Aristotle calls the idos./a \"There is, too,\" says he,\n\"a fourth, - the purpose of the work as a whole.\" Now I shall show you\nwhat this last means.  Bronze is the \"first cause\" of the statue,\nfor it could never have been made unless there had been something from\nwhich it could be cast and moulded.  The \"second cause \" is the artist;\nfor without the skilled hands of a workman that bronze could not have been\nshaped to the outlines of the statue.  The \"third cause\" is the form,\ninasmuch as our statue could never be called The Lance-Bearer or The Boy\nBinding his Hair/b had not this special shape been stamped upon it.\nThe \"fourth cause\" is the purpose of the work.  For if this purpose\nhad not existed, the statue would not have been made.  Now what is\nthis purpose?  It is that which attracted the artist which he followed\nwhen he made the statue.  It may have been money, if he has made it\nfor sale; or renown, if he has worked for reputation; or religion, if he\nhas wrought it as a gift for a temple.  Therefore this also is a cause\ncontributing towards the making of the statue;\n<Ep1-447>\nEPISTLE LXV.\nor do you think that we should avoid including, among the causes of\na thing which has been made, that element without which the thing in question\nwould not have been made?\nTo these four Plato adds a fifth cause, -\nthe pattern which he himself calls the \"idea\"; for it is this that the\nartist gazed upon/a when he created the work which he had decided to carry\nout.  Now it makes no difference whether he has this pattern outside\nhimself, that he may direct his glance to it, or within himself, conceived\nand placed there by himself.  God has within himself these patterns\nof all things, and his mind comprehends the harmonies and the measures\nof the whole totality of things which are to be carried out; he is filled\nwith these shapes which Plato calls the \"ideas,\" - imperishable, unchangeable,\nnot subject to decay. And therefore, though men die, humanity itself, or\nthe idea of man, according to which man is moulded, lasts on, and though\nmen toil and perish, it suffers no change.  Accordingly, there are\nfive causes, as Plato says/b: the material, the agent, the make-up, the\nmodel, and the end in view.  Last comes the result of all these.\nJust as in the case of the statue, - to go back to the figure with which\nwe began, - the material is the bronze, the agent is the artist, the make-up\nis the form which is adapted to the material, the model is the pattern\nimitated by the agent, the end in view is the purpose in the maker's mind,\nand, finally, the result of all these is the statue itself.  The universe\nalso, in Plato's opinion, possesses all these elements.  The agent\nis God; the source, matter; the form, the shape and the arrangement of\nthe visible world.  The pattern is doubtless the model according to\nwhich God has made this great and most beautiful\n<Ep1-449>\nEPISTLE LXV.\ncreation.  The purpose is his object in so doing.  Do you\nask what God's purpose is?  It is goodness.  Plato, at any rate,\nsays: \"What was God's reason for creating the world?  God is good,\nand no good person is grudging of anything that is good.  Therefore,\nGod made it the best world possible.\" Hand down your opinion, then, O judge;\nstate who seems to you to say what is truest, and not who says what is\nabsolutely true.  For to do that is as far beyond our ken as truth\nitself.\nThis throng of causes, defined by Aristotle\nand by Plato, embraces either too much or too little./a For if they regard\nas \"causes\" of an object that is to be made everything without which the\nobject cannot be made, they have named too few.  Time must be included\namong the causes; for nothing can be made without time.  They must\nalso include place; for if there be no place where a thing can be made,\nit will not be made.  And motion too; nothing is either made or destroyed\nwithout motion. There is no art without motion, no change of any kind.\nNow, however, I am searching for the first, the general cause; this must\nbe simple, inasmuch as matter, too, is simple.  Do we ask what cause\nis?  It is surely Creative Reason,/b - in other words, God.\nFor those clements to which you referred are not a great series of independent\ncauses; they all hinge on one alone, and that will be the creative cause.\nDo you maintain that form is a cause? This is only what the artist stamps\nupon his work; it is part of a cause, but not the cause.  Neither\nis the pattern a cause, but an indispensable tool of the cause.  His\npattern is as\n<Ep1-451>\nEPISTLE LXV.\nindispensable to the artist as the chisel or the file; without these,\nart can make no progress.  But for all that, these things are neither\nparts of the art, nor causes of it. \"Then,\" perhaps you will say, \"the\npurpose of the artist, that which leads him to undertake to create something,\nis the cause.\" It may be a cause; it is not, however, the efficient cause,\nbut only an accessory cause.  But there are countless accessory causes;\nwhat we are discussing is the general cause.  Now the statement of\nPlato and Aristotle is not in accord with their usual penetration, when\nthey maintain that the whole universe, the perfectly wrought work, is a\ncause. For there is a great difference between a work and the cause of\na work.\nEither give your opinion, or, as is easier\nin cases of this kind, declare that the matter is not clear and call for\nanother hearing./a But you will reply: \"What pleasure do you get from wasting\nyour time on these problems, which relieve you of none of your emotions,\nrout none of your desires?\" So far as I am concerned, I treat and discuss\nthem as matters which contribute greatly toward calming the spirit, and\nI search myself first, and then the world about me.  And not even\nnow am I, as you think, wasting my time.  For all these questions,\nprovided that they be not chopped up and torn apart into such unprofitable\nrefinements, elevate and lighten the soul, which is weighted down by a\nheavy burden and desires to be freed and to return to the elements of which\nit was once a part.  For this body of ours is a weight upon the\nsoul+ and its penance; as the load presses down the soul is crushed\nand is in bondage, unless philosophy has come to its assistance and has\nbid it take fresh courage by contemplating the\n<Ep1-453>\nEPISTLE LXV.\nuniverse, and has turned it from things earthly to things divine.\nThere it has its liberty, there it can roam abroad/a; meantime it escapes\nthe custody in which it is bound, and renews its life in heaven.\nJust as skilled workmen, who have been engaged upon some delicate piece\nof work which wearies their eyes with straining, if the light which they\nhave is niggardly or uncertain, go forth into the open air and in some\npark devoted to the people's recreation delight their eyes in the generous\nlight of day; so the soul, imprisoned as it has been in this gloomy and\ndarkened house, seeks the open sky whenever it can, and in the contemplation\nof the universe finds rest.  The wise man, the seeker after wisdom,\nis bound closely, indeed, to his body, but he is an absentee so far as\nhis better self is concerned, and he concentrates his thoughts upon lofty\nthings.  Bound, so to speak, to his oath of allegiance, he regards\nthe period of life as his term of service.  He is so trained that\nhe neither loves nor hates life; he endures a mortal lot, although he knows\nthat an ampler lot is in store for him. Do you forbid me to contemplate\nthe universe?  Do you compel me to withdraw from the whole and restrict\nme to a part?  May I not ask what are the beginnings of all things,\nwho moulded the universe, who took the confused and conglomerate mass of\nsluggish matter, and separated it into its parts?  May I not inquire\nwho is the Master-Builder of this universe, how the mighty bulk was brought\nunder the control of law and order, who gathered together the scattered\natoms, who separated the disordered elements and assigned an outward form\nto elements that lay in one vast shapelessness?  Or whence came all\nthe expanse of light?  And whethber is it fire, or\n<Ep1-455>\nEPISTLE LXV.\neven brighter than fire?/a Am I not to ask these questions?  Must\nI be ignorant of the heights whence I have descended?  Whether I am\nto see this world but once, or to be born many times?  What is my\ndestination afterwards? What abode awaits my soul on its release from the\nlaws of slavery among men?  Do you forbid me to have a share in heaven?\nIn other words, do you bid me live with my head bowed down?  No, I\nam above such an existence; I was born to a greater destiny than to be\na mere cbattel of my body. and I regard this body as nothing but a chain\nwhich manacles my freedom+.\nTherefore, I offer it as a sort of buffer to\nfortune+, and shall allow no wound to penetrate through to my soul.\nFor my body is the only part of me which can suffer injury.  In this\ndwelling, which is exposed to peril, my soul lives free.  Never shall\nthis flesh drive me to feel fear or to assume anypretence+\nthat is unworthy of a good man.  Never shall I lie in order to honour\nthis petty body.  When it seems proper, I shall sever my connexion\nwith it.  And at present, while we are bound together, our alliance\nshall nevertheless not be one of equality; the soul shall bring all quarrels\nbefore its own tribunal.  To despise our bodies is sure\nfreedom+ To return to our subject; this freedom will be greatly helped\nby the contemplation of which we were just speaking.  All things are\nmade up of matter and of God.  God controls matter, which encompasses\nhim and follows him as its guide and leader.  And that which creates,\nin other words, God, is more powerful and precious than matter, which is\nacted upon by God.  God's place in the\n<Ep1-457>\nEPISTLE LXV.\nuniverse corresponds to the soul's relation to man.  World-matter\ncorresponds to our mortal body; therefore let the lower serve the higher.\nLet us be brave in the face of hazards.  Let us not fear wrongs, or\nwounds, or bonds, or poverty.  And what is\ndeath+?  It is either the end, or a process of change. I have\nno fear of ceasing to exist; it is the same as not having begun. Nor do\nI shrink from changing into another state, because I shall, under no conditions,\nbe as cramped as I am now.  Farewell.\n<Ep1-459>\n\u001a\nHome\n| About Ben Schneider\n| Why Stoics\n| Books\n| Disclaimer\n| FAQ\n| Acknowledgements\n| Works Cited\n| Contact", "source": "epistles_vol1.txt"}
