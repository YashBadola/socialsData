{"text": "The human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die\u2014yet not as though there were hope of life. No, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.\nTo become oneself is to become concrete. But to become concrete is neither to become finite nor to become infinite, for that which is to become concrete is a synthesis. Consequently, the development consists in moving away from oneself infinitely by the process of infinitizing oneself, and in returning to oneself infinitely by the process of finitizing oneself. If, on the other hand, the self does not become itself, it is in despair.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.\nMy life is like an eternal night; when will the day dawn? When will the sun rise?\nIf you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; whether you marry or do not marry, you will regret both. Laugh at the world\u2019s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this anguish. Or perhaps he is not the man for whom the poet weeps, but something else...\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the Absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\nIf faith does not make it a holy act to be willing to murder one's son, then let the same judgment be passed upon Abraham as upon every other man. But if faith does make it a holy act, then let us not be afraid of the paradox.\nThe knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. But the knight of faith knows it is glorious to belong to the universal. He knows that it is beautiful and salutary to be the individual who translates himself into the universal, who edits, as it were, a pure and elegant edition of himself, as free from errors as possible and which everyone can read. He knows that it is refreshing to become intelligible to oneself in the universal so that he understands it and so that every individual who understands him understands the universal through him, and both rejoice in the security of the universal. He knows that it is beautiful to be born as the individual who has the universal as his home, his friendly abiding place, which at once welcomes him with open arms when he would tarry in it. But he knows also that higher than this there winds a solitary path, narrow and steep; he knows that it is terrible to be born outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveler. He knows that it is humanly speaking crazy and cannot be understood by anyone.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
