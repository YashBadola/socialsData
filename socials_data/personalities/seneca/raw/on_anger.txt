You have demanded of me, Novatus, that I should write on the subject of how anger may be allayed, and it seems to me that you are right in feeling that this passion is especially to be feared, for it is more hideous and wild than any other. The others have some alloy of peace and quiet, but this consists wholly in action and the impulse of grief, raging with an utterly inhuman lust for arms and blood and tortures, careless of itself provided it hurts another, rushing upon the very point of the sword, and greedy for revenge even when it drags the avenger to ruin with itself. Therefore some of the wise have called anger a short madness: for it is equally devoid of self-control, regardless of decorum, forgetful of kinship, obstinately engrossed in whatever it begins to do, deaf to reason and advice, excited by trifling causes, awkward at perceiving what is true and just, and very like a falling rock which breaks itself to pieces upon the very thing which it crushes. That you may know that they whom anger possesses are not sane, look at their appearance; for as there are certain symptoms of madness, such as a bold and threatening mien, a gloomy brow, a fierce expression, a hurried step, restless hands, an altered colour, a quick and strongly heaving breath, so likewise are the marks of the angry man: his eyes blaze and sparkle, his whole face is crimson with the blood that surges from the lowest depths of the heart, his lips quiver, his teeth are set, his hair bristles and stands on end, his breath is forced and harsh, his joints crack from writhing, he groans and bellows, bursts out into speech with scarcely intelligible words, strikes his hands together, and stamps the ground with his feet; his whole body is excited and performs great angry threats; it is an ugly and horrible picture of distorted and swollen frenzy – you cannot tell whether this vice is more execrable or more hideous.

Other vices conceal themselves: anger lays itself open and wears its heart upon its sleeve: the greater it is, the more visibly it boils forth. Do you not see how animals of all kinds, as soon as they bestir themselves for mischief, show premonitory signs of their ferocity, and how their whole bodies quit their ordinary peaceful state of repose and exasperate their savage nature? The boar foams at the mouth and sharpens his tusks by rubbing them against trees, the bull tosses his horns in the empty air and scatters the sand with the violent blows of his feet, lions growl, snakes' necks swell as they breathe venom, rabid dogs have a grim look: there is no animal so hateful or so pernicious by nature that it does not show a fresh accession of fierceness as soon as it is seized by anger.

Some, therefore, of the wise have defined anger as a temporary madness. For like madness, it is incapable of self-control, forgetful of decency, unmindful of ties, persistent and diligent in whatever it begins, closed to reason and counsel, agitated by trifling causes, unfit to discern the right and true, and very like a falling rock, which breaks itself to pieces upon the very thing which it crushes.
