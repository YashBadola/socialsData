{"text": "Fragment 1\nAlthough this Logos holds forever, men ever fail to comprehend it, both before they hear it and once they have heard. Although all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men are like the untried when they try such words and works as I set forth, distinguishing each according to its nature and telling how it is. But other men are oblivious of what they do awake, just as they are forgetful of what they do asleep.\nFragment 2\nWe should let ourselves be guided by what is common to all. Yet, although the Logos is common to all, most men live as if each of them had a private intelligence of his own.\nFragment 10\nCombinations are wholes and not wholes, concurrence and ambivalence, agreement and disagreement, and from all things One and from One all things.\nFragment 12\nOn those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow.\nFragment 30\nThis world-order, the same of all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: everliving fire, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures.\nFragment 45\nYou will not find the boundaries of soul by travelling in any direction, so deep is the measure of it.\nFragment 49a\nIn the same river we both step and do not step, we are and are not.\nFragment 50\nListening not to me but to the Logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.\nFragment 51\nThey do not understand how that which differs with itself is in agreement: harmony consists of opposing tension, like that of the bow and the lyre.\nFragment 52\nTime is a child playing, moving counters on a board; the kingdom belongs to the child.\nFragment 53\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nFragment 54\nInvisible harmony is stronger than visible.\nFragment 60\nThe way up and the way down are one and the same.\nFragment 62\nImmortals are mortal, mortals immortal, living their death, dying their life.\nFragment 67\nGod is day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger; he undergoes alteration in the way that fire, when it is mixed with spices, is named according to the scent of each of them.\nFragment 80\nWe must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.\nFragment 88\nAnd it is the same thing in us that is quick and dead, awake and asleep, young and old; the former are shifted and become the latter, and the latter in turn are shifted and become the former.\nFragment 90\nAll things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.\nFragment 91\nYou cannot step twice into the same river.\nFragment 101\nI searched into myself.\nFragment 102\nTo God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\nFragment 119\nMan's character is his fate.\nFragment 123\nNature loves to hide.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
