One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nPrayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.\nFace the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are.\nIt is quite true what philosophy says: that life must be understood backwards. But that makes one forget the other saying: that it must be lived - forwards.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.\nThe function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.\nFaith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.\nIf I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible.

But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.\nMost men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.\nMy life is like an eternal night...\nThe paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.\nI stick my finger into existence \u2014 it smells of nothing. Where am I? Who am I? How came I here? What is this thing called the world? What does this world mean? Who is it that has lured me into the thing and now leaves me there? ... How did I come into the world? Why was I not consulted... but was thrust into the ranks as if I had been bought by a kidnapper, a dealer in souls?
