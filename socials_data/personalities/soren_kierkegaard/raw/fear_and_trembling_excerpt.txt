The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.

Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off.

To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?

By faith Abraham did not renounce his claim upon Isaac, but by faith he got Isaac. By faith Abraham did not become a hero, but by faith he became a knight of resignation? No, he became a knight of faith.
