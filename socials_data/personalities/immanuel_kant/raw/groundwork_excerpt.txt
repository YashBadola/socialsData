Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.

So act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.

A rational being belongs as a member to the kingdom of ends when, although giving universal laws in it, he is also himself subject to these laws. He belongs to it as sovereign when, while giving laws, he is not subject to the will of any other.
