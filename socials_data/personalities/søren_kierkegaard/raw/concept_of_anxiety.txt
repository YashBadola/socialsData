The possible corresponds exactly to the future. For freedom the possible is the future, and for time the future is the possible. Corresponding to both of these in the individual life is anxiety. A precise definition of anxiety would therefore be: anxiety is freedom's possibility.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs in this dizziness.

Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

The concept of anxiety is distinct from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom's reality as possibility for possibility.
