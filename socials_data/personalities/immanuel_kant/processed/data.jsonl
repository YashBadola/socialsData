{"text": "PREFACE\nAncient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences: Physics, Ethics, and Logic. This division is perfectly suitable to the nature of the thing; and the only improvement that can be made in it is to add the principle on which it is based, so that we may both satisfy ourselves of its completeness, and also be able to determine correctly the necessary subdivisions.\nAll rational knowledge is either material or formal: the former considers some object, the latter is concerned only with the form of the understanding and of the reason itself, and with the universal laws of thought in general without distinction of its objects. Formal philosophy is called Logic. Material philosophy, however, which has to do with determinate objects and the laws to which they are subject, is again twofold; for these laws are either laws of nature or laws of freedom. The science of the former is Physics, that of the latter, Ethics; they are also called Natural Philosophy and Moral Philosophy respectively.\nLogic cannot have any empirical part; that is, a part in which the universal and necessary laws of thought should rest on grounds taken from experience; otherwise it would not be logic, i.e., a canon for the understanding or the reason, valid for all thought and capable of demonstration. Natural and moral philosophy, on the contrary, can each have their empirical part, since the former has to determine the laws of nature as an object of experience; the latter the laws of the human will, so far as it is affected by nature: the former, however, as laws according to which everything does happen; the latter, as laws according to which everything ought to happen, although these also consider the conditions under which it so often does not happen.\nWe may call all philosophy empirical, so far as it is based on grounds of experience: on the other hand, that which delivers its doctrines from a priori principles alone we may call pure philosophy. When the latter is merely formal, it is logic; if it is restricted to definite objects of the understanding, it is metaphysics.\nIn this way there arises the idea of a twofold metaphysics - a Metaphysics of Nature and a Metaphysics of Morals. Physics will thus have an empirical and also a rational part. Ethics will be similar here, although the empirical part might be called specifically practical anthropology, while the rational part would properly be called morals.\nSECTION I\nTRANSITION FROM THE COMMON RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF MORALITY TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL\nNothing can possibly be conceived in the world, or even out of it, which can be called good, without qualification, except a good will. Intelligence, wit, judgment, and the other talents of the mind, however they may be named, or courage, resolution, perseverance, as qualities of temperament, are undoubtedly good and desirable in many respects; but these gifts of nature may also become extremely bad and mischievous if the will which is to make use of them, and which, therefore, constitutes what is called character, is not good. It is the same with the gifts of fortune. Power, riches, honor, even health, and the general well-being and contentment with one's condition which is called happiness, inspire pride, and often presumption, if there is not a good will to correct the influence of these on the mind, and with this also to rectify the whole principle of acting and adapt it to its end. The sight of a being who is not adorned with a single feature of a pure and good will, enjoying unbroken prosperity, can never give pleasure to an impartial rational spectator. Thus a good will appears to constitute the indispensable condition even of being worthy of happiness.\nThere is no possibility of thinking of anything at all in the world, or even out of it, which can be regarded as good without qualification, except a good will.\nAct only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.", "source": "groundwork_metaphysics_morals_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\nHuman reason has this peculiar fate that in one species of its knowledge it is burdened by questions which, as prescribed by the very nature of reason itself, it is not able to ignore, but which, as transcending all its powers, it is also not able to answer.\nThe perplexity into which it thus falls is not due to any fault of its own. It begins with principles which it has no option save to employ in the course of experience, and which this experience at the same time abundantly justifies. With these reason rises, in continuous progression, to ever higher, remoter conditions. But it quickly discovers that, in this way, its work must remain ever incomplete, because new questions never cease to arise; and so it finds itself compelled to have recourse to principles which transcend the region of experience, while yet appearing so secure that reason accepts them without hesitation, and indeed that ordinary human reason cannot do without them. Thus it falls into confusion and contradictions, from which it conjectures that there must be some latent errors, which it is unable to detect, since the principles on which it proceeds, as using limits of all experience, are no longer subject to any empirical test. The battlefield of these endless controversies is called metaphysics.\nTime was when metaphysics was entitled the Queen of all the sciences; and if the will be taken for the deed, the pre-eminent importance of her accepted tasks gives her every right to this title of honour. Now, however, the changed fashion of the time brings her only scorn; a matron outcast and forsaken, she mourns like Hecuba: Modo maxima rerum, tot generis natisque potens - nunc trahor exul, inops.\nHer government, under the administration of the dogmatists, was at first despotic. But inasmuch as the legislation still bore traces of the ancient barbarism, her empire gradually broke up, and intestine wars introduced the reign of anarchy; while the sceptics, like nomadic tribes, who hate a permanent habitation and settled mode of living, attacked from time to time those who had organized themselves into civil communities. But their number was, very happily, small; and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of those who persisted in raising new edifices, although on no settled or uniform plan. In recent times the hope has indeed been expressed that these endless dissensions might be brought to an end, and that a judicial investigation of the claims of reason would at last establish lasting peace.\nWhatever may be the reader's attitude towards this problem, he will at least admit that there are two things which, although they dwell in the mind, are strictly distinguished from one another: the object of knowledge and the knowledge of the object. The former is given to us; the latter we have to produce. The former is the matter of knowledge (the object as appearance); the latter is the form of knowledge (the concepts of the understanding). Now, if we can demonstrate that the objects of experience as appearances conform to the concepts of our understanding, and not the other way round, we shall have succeeded in justifying the possibility of synthetic a priori judgments.\nI have found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to make room for faith. The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption that it is possible to make progress in metaphysics without previous criticism of pure reason, is the true source of all that unbelief, always very dogmatic, which militates against morality.\nIf this Critique is not itself to be called a metaphysics, but rather a preparation for it, it will nevertheless serve to clear the ground, and to level it, for the erection of that majestic edifice.", "source": "critique_pure_reason_excerpt.txt"}
