What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.

Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world's foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will also regret it; laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it, you will regret it either way; believe a woman, you will regret it; do not believe her, you will also regret it; believe a woman or do not believe her, you will regret it either way; hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you'll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.

My life is like an eternal night.

Listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth - look at the dying man in his last struggle, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.
