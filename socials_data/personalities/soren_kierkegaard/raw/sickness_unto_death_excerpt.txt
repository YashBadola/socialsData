The possible corresponds exactly to the future. For freedom the possible is the future, and for time the future is the possible. Corresponding to both of these in the individual life is anxiety. A precise definition of anxiety would therefore be: anxiety is freedom's possibility.

The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.

The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

To be a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.

Despair is the Sickness Unto Death.
