What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

My sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's eyrie is built high up on the mountain peaks among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality and seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my quarry home; and this quarry is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace; they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a little, like the Jews; they think that even if the Lord keeps the tabernacle a bit too dark, they may earn a little anyway.

Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that either; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it... Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.

The aesthetic life is a life of immediacy, where the individual seeks pleasure and avoids pain. But this pursuit is ultimately futile, as it leads to boredom and despair. The aesthetician is constantly seeking new experiences, but finds no lasting satisfaction. He is like a stone skimming the surface of the water, never sinking into the depths.

...

The ethical life is a life of duty and commitment. The ethical individual chooses to live by universal moral principles. He takes responsibility for his actions and seeks to become a coherent self. But the ethical life also has its limits. It cannot account for sin or the need for forgiveness.

...

The religious life is the highest stage of existence. It is a life of faith, where the individual relates himself to God. This relationship is paradoxical and cannot be understood by reason. It requires a leap of faith, a suspension of the ethical. The religious individual is the single individual who stands alone before God.

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to whom I give life and being?
