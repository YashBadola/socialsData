{"text": "Judging by what you write me, and by what I hear, I am forming a good opinion regarding your future. You do not run hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for such restlessness is the sign of a disordered spirit. The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company. Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and this visit of a miscellany of books should have the effect of unsteadiness and instability. You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win a firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner.\nFood does not profit the man who eats it, nor does it assimilate into the body if it is sent away as soon as it is eaten. Nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.\nAccordingly, since you cannot read all the books which you may possess, it is enough to possess only as many books as you can read. \"But,\" you reply, \"I wish to dip first into one book and then into another.\" I tell you that it is the sign of an over-nice appetite to toy with many dishes; for when they are manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish. So you should always read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall back upon those whom you read before. Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day.\nThis is my own custom; from the many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself. The thought for to-day is one which I discovered in Epicurus; for I am wont to cross over even into the enemy's camp,\u2014not as a deserter, but as a scout. He says: \"Contented poverty is an honourable estate.\" Indeed, if it be contented, it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. What does it matter how much a man has laid up in his safe, or in his warehouse, how large are his flocks and how fat his dividends, if he covets his neighbour's property, and reckons, not his past gains, but his hopes of gains to come? Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.\nFarewell.", "source": "letter_2.txt"}
{"text": "We shall now examine whether anger is in accordance with nature, and whether it is useful and ought to be retained in some measure.\nI say that anger is not in accordance with nature. For if we look at man, is there anything gentler? If we look at anger, is there anything more savage? Man is born for mutual help; anger for mutual destruction. The one seeks to form unions; the other to separate. The one seeks to do good; the other to do harm. The one helps even strangers; the other attacks even its dearest friends. The one is ready even to sacrifice itself for the good of others; the other to plunge into peril provided it drags another down. Who, then, is more ignorant of the nature of things than he who ascribes this savage and pernicious vice to nature\u2019s best and most finished work?\n\"But,\" you say, \"anger is useful, because it makes men more ready to fight.\" I answer that drunkenness also makes men more ready to fight, and so does frenzy, and so does fear; for fear often makes men bold when they are driven into a corner. But anger is never useful, not even in war; for it is not the angry man who fights best, but the man who is cool and collected, who knows what he is doing, and who does not allow his passion to obscure his judgment.", "source": "on_anger.txt"}
{"text": "Greetings from your Seneca.\nContinue to act thus, my dear Lucilius\u2014set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself believe the truth of my words\u2014that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.\nWhat man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.\nTherefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity,\u2014time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.\nYou may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising. I confess that, in the case of one who spends freely and still keeps accounts, I am balancing my books. I cannot boast that I waste nothing, but I can at least tell you what I am wasting, and the cause and manner of the loss; I can give you the reasons why I am a poor man. My situation, however, is the same as that of many who are reduced to slender means through no fault of their own: every one forgives them, but no one comes to their rescue.\nWhat is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.\nFarewell.", "source": "letter_1.txt"}
{"text": "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death\u2019s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it\u2026 Life is long if you know how to use it.\nMen trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come before the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted as a very cheap thing\u2014nay, of almost no value at all. Men set a very high value on pensions and doles, and for these they hire out their labour or their service or their patience. But no one sets a value on time; all use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But see these same people, when they fall sick and the danger of death draws nearer, how they clasp the knees of the doctors; if they fear a capital charge, how ready they are to buy their lives with all their possessions! Such are the inconsistent emotions that grip them. But if each one could have the number of his future years set before him as is possible in the case of the years that have passed, how alarmed would be those who saw only a few remaining, and how sparing of them would they be! And yet it is easy to dispense an amount that is assured, no matter how small it may be; but that which is to be guarded with greater care is that which may fail you when you least expect it.", "source": "on_shortness_of_life.txt"}
