PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age
is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt
cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to
make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs
attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every
Assistant Professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in
philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes
further. It might be asked where they are going, but surely it is
courteous and proper to assume that they have doubted everything, since
otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further. Having made
this motion, they have all of them established a preliminary assumption
to begin with, and it might be thought that this would be enough to
start one off; for Descartes did not do so much.

What is the Ethical? What is the Absolute?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the
same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it
applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing
without itself which is its _telos_, but is itself _telos_ for everything
outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go
no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the
particular individual is the individual who has his _telos_ in the
universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it,
to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon
as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against
the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again
reconcile himself with the universal.

The Knight of Faith

He is humanly speaking crazy and cannot make himself intelligible to
anyone. And yet it is the mildest expression, to say that he is crazy.
If he is not crazy, he is a much higher being, or else he is lost--that
is, by virtue of the absurd.
