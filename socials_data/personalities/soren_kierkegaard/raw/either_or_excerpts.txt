DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish,
but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass
over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that
of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a
brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could
not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when
they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

...

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says
of it: That piece cannot be moved.

...

My sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle’s eyrie is built high up on
the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly
down into reality and seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I
bring my booty home. And this booty is a picture I weave into the
tapestries of my palace.

...

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is
paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like
lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts
of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be
regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in
the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions
sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the
coin a trifle, like the Jews; they think that even if the Lord keeps
the tabernacles of his anger carefully, he may not notice it. Out upon
them! This is the reason my soul always turns back to the Old Testament
and to Shakespeare. I feel that those who speak there are at least
human beings: they hate, they love, they murder their enemies, and curse
their descendants throughout all generations, they sin.

THE ROTATION OF CROPS

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle
is supposed to be very reasonable; I yield to them and proceed from
the basic principle that all people are boring. Or is there anyone who
would be boring enough to contradict me in this regard? This basic
principle has to the highest degree the repelling force always possessed
by the negative, which is actually the principle of motion. It is not
merely repelling but infinitely repulsive, and whoever has the basic
principle behind him must necessarily have infinite momentum for making
discoveries.

Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom,
which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity
to initiate motion. The effect that boredom has is altogether magical,
but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.
