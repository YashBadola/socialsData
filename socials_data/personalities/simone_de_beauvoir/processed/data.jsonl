{"text": "The human condition is one of fundamental ambiguity. We are at once a subject, a consciousness that transcends the world, and an object, a body that is situated within it. This dual nature is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be lived. To deny either side of this equation is to fall into bad faith.", "source": "Reflections on Ambiguity and Existence"}
{"text": "Freedom is not a given; it is a conquest. We are born into a world of meaning that is not of our making, but we have the capacity\u2014and the responsibility\u2014to reshape it. However, this freedom is terrifying. It burdens us with the weight of our choices. To escape this weight, we often seek refuge in the seriousness of the 'serious man', who accepts values as ready-made things, or in the nihilism of the one who denies all value. Both are flights from freedom.", "source": "Reflections on Ambiguity and Existence"}
{"text": "One cannot will oneself free without willing others free. My freedom is inextricably linked to the freedom of others. If I oppress another, I am not truly free, for I have reduced myself to a tyrant, a thing defined by its power over another thing. True freedom requires the recognition of the other as a free subject. This is the ethical imperative of existentialism.", "source": "Reflections on Ambiguity and Existence"}
{"text": "Consider the situation of women. For centuries, woman has been defined as the 'Other'. Man is the Subject, the Absolute; she is the Other. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her. This objectification is a denial of her humanity, her transcendence. To be a woman in such a world is to be constantly thrust back into immanence, to be treated as a passive object rather than an active agent. But biology is not destiny. One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.", "source": "Reflections on Ambiguity and Existence"}
{"text": "The oppression of any group\u2014women, the colonized, the proletariat\u2014is an assault on human freedom itself. We must struggle against the mystifications that justify this oppression. We must expose the mechanisms by which the oppressors turn the oppressed into accomplices of their own subjugation. But we must also recognize that the oppressed retain their freedom, however limited. To deny this is to treat them as mere things, which is the very crime of the oppressor.", "source": "Reflections on Ambiguity and Existence"}
{"text": "In the face of an indifferent universe, we must create our own meaning. We project ourselves into the future through our projects. But we must never lose sight of the fact that our projects are finite, and that failure is always a possibility. This is the tragic dimension of action. Yet, it is only through action that we exist. To refrain from acting is to die while still alive.", "source": "Reflections on Ambiguity and Existence"}
{"text": "We are alone, without excuse. We are responsible for our world. This responsibility is heavy, but it is also the source of our dignity. Let us not flee from the ambiguity of our existence, but embrace it. Let us choose freedom, for ourselves and for others.", "source": "Reflections on Ambiguity and Existence"}
