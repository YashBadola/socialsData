WHAT IS A POET? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they were transformed into sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"--which is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious." And the critics come forward and say, "That is perfectly done--just as the rules of aesthetics demand." To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.

I HAVE nothing more to lose, nothing to lose but my reason, and that I shall bring into the bargain.

OF all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy--to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work. Therefore, whenever I see a fly settling, in the decisive moment, on the nose of such a person of affairs; or if he is spattered with mud from a carriage which drives past him in still greater haste; or the drawbridge opens up before him; or a tile falls down and knocks him dead, then I laugh heartily. And who could help laughing? What do they accomplish, these hustlers? Are they not like a woman who when her house is on fire carries out a fire-tongs? What things of greater account do they salvage from life's great conflagration?

I DO not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, walking is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. _Summa summarum_: I do not care at all.

MY life is like an eternal night; when I die I shall be able to say: "Evening has come."

MY view of life is utterly meaningless. I suppose an evil spirit has set a pair of spectacles upon my nose, of which one lens is a tremendously powerful magnifying glass, the other an equally powerful reducing glass.

THEY say the era of miracles is past, but that is not true. Have we not seen a logical system, which ought to be a collection of the most consistent concepts, actually operated by a lot of oddities and whimsicalities? Have we not seen that what is most abstract can be made most concrete? Have we not seen the most abstract of all things, the pure being, come to life in the person of a private docent?
