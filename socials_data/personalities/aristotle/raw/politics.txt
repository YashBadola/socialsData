As we see that every city is a society, and every society Ed. is
   established for some good purpose; for an apparent [Bekker 1252a] good
   is the spring of all human actions; it is evident that this is the
   principle upon which they are every one founded, and this is more
   especially true of that which has for its object the best possible, and
   is itself the most excellent, and comprehends all the rest. Now this is
   called a city, and the society thereof a political society; for those
   who think that the principles of a political, a regal, a family, and a
   herile government are the same are mistaken, while they suppose that
   each of these differ in the numbers to whom their power extends, but
   not in their constitution: so that with them a herile government is one
   composed of a very few, a domestic of more, a civil and a regal of
   still more, as if there was no difference between a large family and a
   small city, or that a regal government and a political one are the
   same, only that in the one a single person is continually at the head
   of public affairs; in the other, that each member of the state has in
   his turn a share in the government, and is at one time a magistrate, at
   another a private person, according to the rules of political science.
   But now this is not true, as will be evident to any one who will
   consider this question in the most approved method. As, in an inquiry
   into every other subject, it is necessary to separate the different
   parts of which it is compounded, till we arrive at their first
   elements, which are the most minute parts thereof; so by the same
   proceeding we shall acquire a knowledge of the primary parts of a city
   and see wherein they differ from each other, and whether the rules of
   art will give us any assistance in examining into each of these things
   which are mentioned.

   Now if in this particular science any one would attend to its original
   seeds, and their first shoot, he would then as in others have the
   subject perfectly before him; and perceive, in the first place, that it
   is requisite that those should be joined together whose species cannot
   exist without each other, as the male and the female, for the business
   of propagation; and this not through choice, but by that natural
   impulse which acts both upon plants and animals also, for the purpose
   of their leaving behind them others like themselves. It is also from
   natural causes that some beings command and others obey, that each may
   obtain their mutual safety; for a being who is endowed with a mind
   capable of reflection and forethought is by nature the superior and
   governor, whereas he whose excellence is merely corporeal is formect to
   be a slave; whence it follows that the different state of master
   [1252b] and slave is equally advantageous to both. But there is a
   natural difference between a female and a slave: for nature is not like
   the artists who make the Delphic swords for the use of the poor, but
   for every particular purpose she has her separate instruments, and thus
   her ends are most complete, for whatsoever is employed on one subject
   only, brings that one to much greater perfection than when employed on
   many; and yet among the barbarians, a female and a slave are upon a
   level in the community, the reason for which is, that amongst them
   there are none qualified by nature to govern, therefore their society
   can be nothing but between slaves of different sexes. For which reason
   the poets say, it is proper for the Greeks to govern the barbarians, as
   if a barbarian and a slave were by nature one. Now of these two
   societies the domestic is the first, and Hesiod is right when he says,
   "First a house, then a wife, then an ox for the plough," for the poor
   man has always an ox before a household slave. That society then which
   nature has established for daily support is the domestic, and those who
   compose it are called by Charondas homosipuoi, and by Epimenides the
   Cretan homokapnoi; but the society of many families, which was first
   instituted for their lasting, mutual advantage, is called a village,
   and a village is most naturally composed of the descendants of one
   family, whom some persons call homogalaktes, the children and the
   children's children thereof: for which reason cities were originally
   governed by kings, as the barbarian states now are, which are composed
   of those who had before submitted to kingly government; for every
   family is governed by the elder, as are the branches thereof, on
   account of their relationship thereunto, which is what Homer says,
   "Each one ruled his wife and child;" and in this scattered manner they
   formerly lived. And the opinion which universally prevails, that the
   gods themselves are subject to kingly government, arises from hence,
   that all men formerly were, and many are so now; and as they imagined
   themselves to be made in the likeness of the gods, so they supposed
   their manner of life must needs be the same. And when many villages so
   entirely join themselves together as in every respect to form but one
   society, that society is a city, and contains in itself, if I may so
   speak, the end and perfection of government: first founded that we
   might live, but continued that we may live happily. For which reason
   every city must be allowed to be the work of nature, if we admit that
   the original society between male and female is; for to this as their
   end all subordinate societies tend, and the end of everything is the
   nature of it. For what every being is in its most perfect state, that
   certainly is the nature of that being, whether it be a man, a horse, or
   a house: besides, whatsoever produces the final cause and the end which
   we [1253a] desire, must be best; but a government complete in itself is
   that final cause and what is best. Hence it is evident that a city is a
   natural production, and that man is naturally a political animal, and
   that whosoever is naturally and not accidentally unfit for society,
   must be either inferior or superior to man: thus the man in Homer, who
   is reviled for being "without society, without law, without family."
   Such a one must naturally be of a quarrelsome disposition, and as
   solitary as the birds. The gift of speech also evidently proves that
   man is a more social animal than the bees, or any of the herding
   cattle: for nature, as we say, does nothing in vain, and man is the
   only animal who enjoys it. Voice indeed, as being the token of pleasure
   and pain, is imparted to others also, and thus much their nature is
   capable of, to perceive pleasure and pain, and to impart these
   sensations to others; but it is by speech that we are enabled to
   express what is useful for us, and what is hurtful, and of course what
   is just and what is unjust: for in this particular man differs from
   other animals, that he alone has a perception of good and evil, of just
   and unjust, and it is a participation of these common sentiments which
   forms a family and a city. Besides, the notion of a city naturally
   precedes that of a family or an individual, for the whole must
   necessarily be prior to the parts, for if you take away the whole man,
   you cannot say a foot or a hand remains, unless by equivocation, as
   supposing a hand of stone to be made, but that would only be a dead
   one; but everything is understood to be this or that by its energic
   qualities and powers, so that when these no longer remain, neither can
   that be said to be the same, but something of the same name. That a
   city then precedes an individual is plain, for if an individual is not
   in himself sufficient to compose a perfect government, he is to a city
   as other parts are to a whole; but he that is incapable of society, or
   so complete in himself as not to want it, makes no part of a city, as a
   beast or a god. There is then in all persons a natural impetus to
   associate with each other in this manner, and he who first founded
   civil society was the cause of the greatest good; for as by the
   completion of it man is the most excellent of all living beings, so
   without law and justice he would be the worst of all, for nothing is so
   difficult to subdue as injustice in arms: but these arms man is born
   with, namely, prudence and valour, which he may apply to the most
   opposite purposes, for he who abuses them will be the most wicked, the
   most cruel, the most lustful, and most gluttonous being imaginable; for
   justice is a political virtue, by the rules of it the state is
   regulated, and these rules are the criterion of what is right.
