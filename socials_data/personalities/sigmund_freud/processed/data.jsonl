McCANN COMPANY\n1920\nTHE JAMES A. McCANN COMPANY\nPRINTED IN THE U.S.A.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe medical profession is justly conservative. Human life should not be\nconsidered as the proper material for wild experiments.\nConservatism, however, is too often a welcome excuse for lazy minds,\nloath to adapt themselves to fast changing conditions.\nRemember the scornful reception which first was accorded to Freud's\ndiscoveries in the domain of the unconscious.\nWhen after years of patient observations, he finally decided to appear\nbefore medical bodies to tell them modestly of some facts which always\nrecurred in his dream and his patients' dreams, he was first laughed at\nand then avoided as a crank.\nThe words \"dream interpretation\" were and still are indeed fraught with\nunpleasant, unscientific associations. They remind one of all sorts of\nchildish, superstitious notions, which make up the thread and woof of\ndream books, read by none but the ignorant and the primitive.\nThe wealth of detail, the infinite care never to let anything pass\nunexplained, with which he presented to the public the result of his\ninvestigations, are impressing more and more serious-minded scientists,\nbut the examination of his evidential data demands arduous work and\npresupposes an absolutely open mind.\nThis is why we still encounter men, totally unfamiliar with Freud's\nwritings, men who were not even interested enough in the subject to\nattempt an interpretation of their dreams or their patients' dreams,\nderiding Freud's theories and combatting them with the help of\nstatements which he never made.\nSome of them, like Professor Boris Sidis, reach at times conclusions\nwhich are strangely similar to Freud's, but in their ignorance of\npsychoanalytic literature, they fail to credit Freud for observations\nantedating theirs.\nBesides those who sneer at dream study, because they have never looked\ninto the subject, there are those who do not dare to face the facts\nrevealed by dream study. Dreams tell us many an unpleasant biological\ntruth about ourselves and only very free minds can thrive on such a\ndiet. Self-deception is a plant which withers fast in the pellucid\natmosphere of dream investigation.\nThe weakling and the neurotic attached to his neurosis are not anxious\nto turn such a powerful searchlight upon the dark corners of their\npsychology.\nFreud's theories are anything but theoretical.\nHe was moved by the fact that there always seemed to be a close\nconnection between his patients' dreams and their mental abnormalities,\nto collect thousands of dreams and to compare them with the case\nhistories in his possession.\nHe did not start out with a preconceived bias, hoping to find evidence\nwhich might support his views. He looked at facts a thousand times\n\"until they began to tell him something.\"\nHis attitude toward dream study was, in other words, that of a\nstatistician who does not know, and has no means of foreseeing, what\nconclusions will be forced on him by the information he is gathering,\nbut who is fully prepared to accept those unavoidable conclusions.\nThis was indeed a novel way in psychology. Psychologists had always been\nwont to build, in what Bleuler calls \"autistic ways,\" that is through\nmethods in no wise supported by evidence, some attractive hypothesis,\nwhich sprung from their brain, like Minerva from Jove's brain, fully\narmed.\nAfter which, they would stretch upon that unyielding frame the hide of a\nreality which they had previously killed.\nIt is only to minds suffering from the same distortions, to minds also\nautistically inclined, that those empty, artificial structures appear\nacceptable molds for philosophic thinking.\nThe pragmatic view that \"truth is what works\" had not been as yet\nexpressed when Freud published his revolutionary views on the psychology\nof dreams.\nFive facts of first magnitude were made obvious to the world by his\ninterpretation of dreams.\nFirst of all, Freud pointed out a constant connection between some part\nof every dream and some detail of the dreamer's life during the previous\nwaking state. This positively establishes a relation between sleeping\nstates and waking states and disposes of the widely prevalent view that\ndreams are purely nonsensical phenomena coming from nowhere and leading\nnowhere.\nSecondly, Freud, after studying the dreamer's life and modes of thought,\nafter noting down all his mannerisms and the apparently insignificant\ndetails of his conduct which reveal his secret thoughts, came to the\nconclusion that there was in every dream the attempted or successful\ngratification of some wish, conscious or unconscious.\nThirdly, he proved that many of our dream visions are symbolical, which\ncauses us to consider them as absurd and unintelligible; the\nuniversality of those symbols, however, makes them very transparent to\nthe trained observer.\nFourthly, Freud showed that sexual desires play an enormous part in our\nunconscious, a part which puritanical hypocrisy has always tried to\nminimize, if not to ignore entirely.\nFinally, Freud established a direct connection between dreams and\ninsanity, between the symbolic visions of our sleep and the symbolic\nactions of the mentally deranged.\nThere were, of course, many other observations which Freud made while\ndissecting the dreams of his patients, but not all of them present as\nmuch interest as the foregoing nor were they as revolutionary or likely\nto wield as much influence on modern psychiatry.\nOther explorers have struck the path blazed by Freud and leading into\nman's unconscious. Jung of Zurich, Adler of Vienna and Kempf of\nWashington, D.C., have made to the study of the unconscious,\ncontributions which have brought that study into fields which Freud\nhimself never dreamt of invading.\nOne fact which cannot be too emphatically stated, however, is that but\nfor Freud's wishfulfillment theory of dreams, neither Jung's \"energic\ntheory,\" nor Adler's theory of \"organ inferiority and compensation,\"\nnor Kempf's \"dynamic mechanism\" might have been formulated.\nFreud is the father of modern abnormal psychology and he established the\npsychoanalytical point of view. No one who is not well grounded in\nFreudian lore can hope to achieve any work of value in the field of\npsychoanalysis.\nOn the other hand, let no one repeat the absurd assertion that Freudism\nis a sort of religion bounded with dogmas and requiring an act of faith.\nFreudism as such was merely a stage in the development of\npsychoanalysis, a stage out of which all but a few bigoted camp\nfollowers, totally lacking in originality, have evolved. Thousands of\nstones have been added to the structure erected by the Viennese\nphysician and many more will be added in the course of time.\nBut the new additions to that structure would collapse like a house of\ncards but for the original foundations which are as indestructible as\nHarvey's statement as to the circulation of the blood.\nRegardless of whatever additions or changes have been made to the\noriginal structure, the analytic point of view remains unchanged.\nThat point of view is not only revolutionising all the methods of\ndiagnosis and treatment of mental derangements, but compelling the\nintelligent, up-to-date physician to revise entirely his attitude to\nalmost every kind of disease.\nThe insane are no longer absurd and pitiable people, to be herded in\nasylums till nature either cures them or relieves them, through death,\nof their misery. The insane who have not been made so by actual injury\nto their brain or nervous system, are the victims of unconscious forces\nwhich cause them to do abnormally things which they might be helped to\ndo normally.\nInsight into one's psychology is replacing victoriously sedatives and\nrest cures.\nPhysicians dealing with \"purely\" physical cases have begun to take into\nserious consideration the \"mental\" factors which have predisposed a\npatient to certain ailments.\nFreud's views have also made a revision of all ethical and social values\nunavoidable and have thrown an unexpected flood of light upon literary\nand artistic accomplishment.\nBut the Freudian point of view, or more broadly speaking, the\npsychoanalytic point of view, shall ever remain a puzzle to those who,\nfrom laziness or indifference, refuse to survey with the great Viennese\nthe field over which he carefully groped his way. We shall never be\nconvinced until we repeat under his guidance all his laboratory\nexperiments.\nWe must follow him through the thickets of the unconscious, through the\nland which had never been charted because academic philosophers,\nfollowing the line of least effort, had decided _a priori_ that it could\nnot be charted.\nAncient geographers, when exhausting their store of information about\ndistant lands, yielded to an unscientific craving for romance and,\nwithout any evidence to support their day dreams, filled the blank\nspaces left on their maps by unexplored tracts with amusing inserts such\nas \"Here there are lions.\"\nThanks to Freud's interpretation of dreams the \"royal road\" into the\nunconscious is now open to all explorers. They shall not find lions,\nthey shall find man himself, and the record of all his life and of his\nstruggle with reality.\nAnd it is only after seeing man as his unconscious, revealed by his\ndreams, presents him to us that we shall understand him fully. For as\nFreud said to Putnam: \"We are what we are because we have been what we\nhave been.\"\nNot a few serious-minded students, however, have been discouraged from\nattempting a study of Freud's dream psychology.\nThe book in which he originally offered to the world his interpretation\nof dreams was as circumstantial as a legal record to be pondered over by\nscientists at their leisure, not to be assimilated in a few hours by\nthe average alert reader. In those days, Freud could not leave out any\ndetail likely to make his extremely novel thesis evidentially acceptable\nto those willing to sift data.\nFreud himself, however, realized the magnitude of the task which the\nreading of his _magnum opus_ imposed upon those who have not been\nprepared for it by long psychological and scientific training and he\nabstracted from that gigantic work the parts which constitute the\nessential of his discoveries.\nThe publishers of the present book deserve credit for presenting to the\nreading public the gist of Freud's psychology in the master's own words,\nand in a form which shall neither discourage beginners, nor appear too\nelementary to those who are more advanced in psychoanalytic study.\nDream psychology is the key to Freud's works and to all modern\npsychology. With a simple, compact manual such as _Dream Psychology_\nthere shall be no longer any excuse for ignorance of the most\nrevolutionary psychological system of modern times.\nANDR\u00c9 TRIDON.\n121 Madison Avenue, New York.\nNovember, 1920.\nCONTENTS\nCHAPTER                                                             PAGE\nI  DREAMS HAVE A MEANING                                            1\nII  THE DREAM MECHANISM                                             24\nIII  WHY THE DREAM DISGUISES THE DESIRES                             57\nIV  DREAM ANALYSIS                                                  78\nV  SEX IN DREAMS                                                  104\nVI  THE WISH IN DREAMS                                             135\nVII  THE FUNCTION OF THE DREAM                                      164\nVIII  THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PROCESS--REGRESSION                  186\nIX  THE UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUSNESS--REALITY                     220\nDREAM PSYCHOLOGY\nI\nDREAMS HAVE A MEANING\nIn what we may term \"prescientific days\" people were in no uncertainty\nabout the interpretation of dreams. When they were recalled after\nawakening they were regarded as either the friendly or hostile\nmanifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and Divine. With the\nrise of scientific thought the whole of this expressive mythology was\ntransferred to psychology; to-day there is but a small minority among\neducated persons who doubt that the dream is the dreamer's own psychical\nact.\nBut since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an interpretation\nof the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its origin; its\nrelationship to our psychical life when we are awake; its independence\nof disturbances which, during the state of sleep, seem to compel notice;\nits many peculiarities repugnant to our waking thought; the incongruence\nbetween its images and the feelings they engender; then the dream's\nevanescence, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it\naside as something bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating or\nrejecting it--all these and many other problems have for many hundred\nyears demanded answers which up till now could never have been\nsatisfactory. Before all there is the question as to the meaning of the\ndream, a question which is in itself double-sided. There is, firstly,\nthe psychical significance of the dream, its position with regard to the\npsychical processes, as to a possible biological function; secondly, has\nthe dream a meaning--can sense be made of each single dream as of other\nmental syntheses?\nThree tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams. Many\nphilosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies, one which\nat the same time preserves something of the dream's former\nover-valuation. The foundation of dream life is for them a peculiar\nstate of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as elevation to\nsome higher state. Schubert, for instance, claims: \"The dream is the\nliberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, a\ndetachment of the soul from the fetters of matter.\" Not all go so far as\nthis, but many maintain that dreams have their origin in real spiritual\nexcitations, and are the outward manifestations of spiritual powers\nwhose free movements have been hampered during the day (\"Dream\nPhantasies,\" Scherner, Volkelt). A large number of observers acknowledge\nthat dream life is capable of extraordinary achievements--at any rate,\nin certain fields (\"Memory\").\nIn striking contradiction with this the majority of medical writers\nhardly admit that the dream is a psychical phenomenon at all. According\nto them dreams are provoked and initiated exclusively by stimuli\nproceeding from the senses or the body, which either reach the sleeper\nfrom without or are accidental disturbances of his internal organs. The\ndream has no greater claim to meaning and importance than the sound\ncalled forth by the ten fingers of a person quite unacquainted with\nmusic running his fingers over the keys of an instrument. The dream is\nto be regarded, says Binz, \"as a physical process always useless,\nfrequently morbid.\" All the peculiarities of dream life are explicable\nas the incoherent effort, due to some physiological stimulus, of certain\norgans, or of the cortical elements of a brain otherwise asleep.\nBut slightly affected by scientific opinion and untroubled as to the\norigin of dreams, the popular view holds firmly to the belief that\ndreams really have got a meaning, in some way they do foretell the\nfuture, whilst the meaning can be unravelled in some way or other from\nits oft bizarre and enigmatical content. The reading of dreams consists\nin replacing the events of the dream, so far as remembered, by other\nevents. This is done either scene by scene, _according to some rigid\nkey_, or the dream as a whole is replaced by something else of which it\nwas a _symbol_. Serious-minded persons laugh at these efforts--\"Dreams\nare but sea-foam!\"\nOne day I discovered to my amazement that the popular view grounded in\nsuperstition, and not the medical one, comes nearer to the truth about\ndreams. I arrived at new conclusions about dreams by the use of a new\nmethod of psychological investigation, one which had rendered me good\nservice in the investigation of phobias, obsessions, illusions, and the\nlike, and which, under the name \"psycho-analysis,\" had found acceptance\nby a whole school of investigators. The manifold analogies of dream life\nwith the most diverse conditions of psychical disease in the waking\nstate have been rightly insisted upon by a number of medical observers.\nIt seemed, therefore, _a priori_, hopeful to apply to the interpretation\nof dreams methods of investigation which had been tested in\npsychopathological processes. Obsessions and those peculiar sensations\nof haunting dread remain as strange to normal consciousness as do\ndreams to our waking consciousness; their origin is as unknown to\nconsciousness as is that of dreams. It was practical ends that impelled\nus, in these diseases, to fathom their origin and formation. Experience\nhad shown us that a cure and a consequent mastery of the obsessing ideas\ndid result when once those thoughts, the connecting links between the\nmorbid ideas and the rest of the psychical content, were revealed which\nwere heretofore veiled from consciousness. The procedure I employed for\nthe interpretation of dreams thus arose from psychotherapy.\nThis procedure is readily described, although its practice demands\ninstruction and experience. Suppose the patient is suffering from\nintense morbid dread. He is requested to direct his attention to the\nidea in question, without, however, as he has so frequently done,\nmeditating upon it. Every impression about it, without any exception,\nwhich occurs to him should be imparted to the doctor. The statement\nwhich will be perhaps then made, that he cannot concentrate his\nattention upon anything at all, is to be countered by assuring him most\npositively that such a blank state of mind is utterly impossible. As a\nmatter of fact, a great number of impressions will soon occur, with\nwhich others will associate themselves. These will be invariably\naccompanied by the expression of the observer's opinion that they have\nno meaning or are unimportant. It will be at once noticed that it is\nthis self-criticism which prevented the patient from imparting the\nideas, which had indeed already excluded them from consciousness. If the\npatient can be induced to abandon this self-criticism and to pursue the\ntrains of thought which are yielded by concentrating the attention, most\nsignificant matter will be obtained, matter which will be presently seen\nto be clearly linked to the morbid idea in question. Its connection with\nother ideas will be manifest, and later on will permit the replacement\nof the morbid idea by a fresh one, which is perfectly adapted to\npsychical continuity.\nThis is not the place to examine thoroughly the hypothesis upon which\nthis experiment rests, or the deductions which follow from its\ninvariable success. It must suffice to state that we obtain matter\nenough for the resolution of every morbid idea if we especially direct\nour attention to the _unbidden_ associations _which disturb our\nthoughts_--those which are otherwise put aside by the critic as\nworthless refuse. If the procedure is exercised on oneself, the best\nplan of helping the experiment is to write down at once all one's first\nindistinct fancies.\nI will now point out where this method leads when I apply it to the\nexamination of dreams. Any dream could be made use of in this way. From\ncertain motives I, however, choose a dream of my own, which appears\nconfused and meaningless to my memory, and one which has the advantage\nof brevity. Probably my dream of last night satisfies the requirements.\nIts content, fixed immediately after awakening, runs as follows:\n_\"Company; at table or table d'h\u00f4te.... Spinach is served. Mrs. E.L.,\nsitting next to me, gives me her undivided attention, and places her\nhand familiarly upon my knee. In defence I remove her hand. Then she\nsays: 'But you have always had such beautiful eyes.'.... I then\ndistinctly see something like two eyes as a sketch or as the contour of\na spectacle lens....\"_\nThis is the whole dream, or, at all events, all that I can remember. It\nappears to me not only obscure and meaningless, but more especially odd.\nMrs. E.L. is a person with whom I am scarcely on visiting terms, nor to\nmy knowledge have I ever desired any more cordial relationship. I have\nnot seen her for a long time, and do not think there was any mention of\nher recently. No emotion whatever accompanied the dream process.\nReflecting upon this dream does not make it a bit clearer to my mind. I\nwill now, however, present the ideas, without premeditation and without\ncriticism, which introspection yielded. I soon notice that it is an\nadvantage to break up the dream into its elements, and to search out the\nideas which link themselves to each fragment.\n_Company; at table or table d'h\u00f4te._ The recollection of the slight\nevent with which the evening of yesterday ended is at once called up. I\nleft a small party in the company of a friend, who offered to drive me\nhome in his cab. \"I prefer a taxi,\" he said; \"that gives one such a\npleasant occupation; there is always something to look at.\" When we were\nin the cab, and the cab-driver turned the disc so that the first sixty\nhellers were visible, I continued the jest. \"We have hardly got in and\nwe already owe sixty hellers. The taxi always reminds me of the table\nd'h\u00f4te. It makes me avaricious and selfish by continuously reminding me\nof my debt. It seems to me to mount up too quickly, and I am always\nafraid that I shall be at a disadvantage, just as I cannot resist at\ntable d'h\u00f4te the comical fear that I am getting too little, that I must\nlook after myself.\" In far-fetched connection with this I quote:\n\"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,\nTo guilt ye let us heedless go.\"\nAnother idea about the table d'h\u00f4te. A few weeks ago I was very cross\nwith my dear wife at the dinner-table at a Tyrolese health resort,\nbecause she was not sufficiently reserved with some neighbors with whom\nI wished to have absolutely nothing to do. I begged her to occupy\nherself rather with me than with the strangers. That is just as if I had\n_been at a disadvantage at the table d'h\u00f4te_. The contrast between the\nbehavior of my wife at the table and that of Mrs. E.L. in the dream now\nstrikes me: _\"Addresses herself entirely to me.\"_\nFurther, I now notice that the dream is the reproduction of a little\nscene which transpired between my wife and myself when I was secretly\ncourting her. The caressing under cover of the tablecloth was an answer\nto a wooer's passionate letter. In the dream, however, my wife is\nreplaced by the unfamiliar E.L.\nMrs. E.L. is the daughter of a man to whom I _owed money_! I cannot help\nnoticing that here there is revealed an unsuspected connection between\nthe dream content and my thoughts. If the chain of associations be\nfollowed up which proceeds from one element of the dream one is soon led\nback to another of its elements. The thoughts evoked by the dream stir\nup associations which were not noticeable in the dream itself.\nIs it not customary, when some one expects others to look after his\ninterests without any advantage to themselves, to ask the innocent\nquestion satirically: \"Do you think this will be done _for the sake of\nyour beautiful eyes_?\" Hence Mrs. E.L.'s speech in the dream. \"You have\nalways had such beautiful eyes,\" means nothing but \"people always do\neverything to you for love of you; you have had _everything for\nnothing_.\" The contrary is, of course, the truth; I have always paid\ndearly for whatever kindness others have shown me. Still, the fact that\n_I had a ride for nothing_ yesterday when my friend drove me home in his\ncab must have made an impression upon me.\nIn any case, the friend whose guests we were yesterday has often made me\nhis debtor. Recently I allowed an opportunity of requiting him to go by.\nHe has had only one present from me, an antique shawl, upon which eyes\nare painted all round, a so-called Occhiale, as a _charm_ against the\n_Malocchio_. Moreover, he is an _eye specialist_. That same evening I\nhad asked him after a patient whom I had sent to him for _glasses_.\nAs I remarked, nearly all parts of the dream have been brought into this\nnew connection. I still might ask why in the dream it was _spinach_\nthat was served up. Because spinach called up a little scene which\nrecently occurred at our table. A child, whose _beautiful eyes_ are\nreally deserving of praise, refused to eat spinach. As a child I was\njust the same; for a long time I loathed _spinach_, until in later life\nmy tastes altered, and it became one of my favorite dishes. The mention\nof this dish brings my own childhood and that of my child's near\ntogether. \"You should be glad that you have some spinach,\" his mother\nhad said to the little gourmet. \"Some children would be very glad to get\nspinach.\" Thus I am reminded of the parents' duties towards their\nchildren. Goethe's words--\n\"To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,\nTo guilt ye let us heedless go\"--\ntake on another meaning in this connection.\nHere I will stop in order that I may recapitulate the results of the\nanalysis of the dream. By following the associations which were linked\nto the single elements of the dream torn from their context, I have been\nled to a series of thoughts and reminiscences where I am bound to\nrecognize interesting expressions of my psychical life. The matter\nyielded by an analysis of the dream stands in intimate relationship with\nthe dream content, but this relationship is so special that I should\nnever have been able to have inferred the new discoveries directly from\nthe dream itself. The dream was passionless, disconnected, and\nunintelligible. During the time that I am unfolding the thoughts at the\nback of the dream I feel intense and well-grounded emotions. The\nthoughts themselves fit beautifully together into chains logically bound\ntogether with certain central ideas which ever repeat themselves. Such\nideas not represented in the dream itself are in this instance the\nantitheses _selfish, unselfish, to be indebted, to work for nothing_. I\ncould draw closer the threads of the web which analysis has disclosed,\nand would then be able to show how they all run together into a single\nknot; I am debarred from making this work public by considerations of a\nprivate, not of a scientific, nature. After having cleared up many\nthings which I do not willingly acknowledge as mine, I should have much\nto reveal which had better remain my secret. Why, then, do not I choose\nanother dream whose analysis would be more suitable for publication, so\nthat I could awaken a fairer conviction of the sense and cohesion of the\nresults disclosed by analysis? The answer is, because every dream which\nI investigate leads to the same difficulties and places me under the\nsame need of discretion; nor should I forgo this difficulty any the\nmore were I to analyze the dream of some one else. That could only be\ndone when opportunity allowed all concealment to be dropped without\ninjury to those who trusted me.\nThe conclusion which is now forced upon me is that the dream is a _sort\nof substitution_ for those emotional and intellectual trains of thought\nwhich I attained after complete analysis. I do not yet know the process\nby which the dream arose from those thoughts, but I perceive that it is\nwrong to regard the dream as psychically unimportant, a purely physical\nprocess which has arisen from the activity of isolated cortical elements\nawakened out of sleep.\nI must further remark that the dream is far shorter than the thoughts\nwhich I hold it replaces; whilst analysis discovered that the dream was\nprovoked by an unimportant occurrence the evening before the dream.\nNaturally, I would not draw such far-reaching conclusions if only one\nanalysis were known to me. Experience has shown me that when the\nassociations of any dream are honestly followed such a chain of thought\nis revealed, the constituent parts of the dream reappear correctly and\nsensibly linked together; the slight suspicion that this concatenation\nwas merely an accident of a single first observation must, therefore,\nbe absolutely relinquished. I regard it, therefore, as my right to\nestablish this new view by a proper nomenclature. I contrast the dream\nwhich my memory evokes with the dream and other added matter revealed by\nanalysis: the former I call the dream's _manifest content_; the latter,\nwithout at first further subdivision, its _latent content_. I arrive at\ntwo new problems hitherto unformulated: (1) What is the psychical\nprocess which has transformed the latent content of the dream into its\nmanifest content? (2) What is the motive or the motives which have made\nsuch transformation exigent? The process by which the change from latent\nto manifest content is executed I name the _dream-work_. In contrast\nwith this is the _work of analysis_, which produces the reverse\ntransformation. The other problems of the dream--the inquiry as to its\nstimuli, as to the source of its materials, as to its possible purpose,\nthe function of dreaming, the forgetting of dreams--these I will discuss\nin connection with the latent dream-content.\nI shall take every care to avoid a confusion between the _manifest_ and\nthe _latent content_, for I ascribe all the contradictory as well as the\nincorrect accounts of dream-life to the ignorance of this latent\ncontent, now first laid bare through analysis.\nThe conversion of the latent dream thoughts into those manifest deserves\nour close study as the first known example of the transformation of\npsychical stuff from one mode of expression into another. From a mode of\nexpression which, moreover, is readily intelligible into another which\nwe can only penetrate by effort and with guidance, although this new\nmode must be equally reckoned as an effort of our own psychical\nactivity. From the standpoint of the relationship of latent to manifest\ndream-content, dreams can be divided into three classes. We can, in the\nfirst place, distinguish those dreams which have a _meaning_ and are, at\nthe same time, _intelligible_, which allow us to penetrate into our\npsychical life without further ado. Such dreams are numerous; they are\nusually short, and, as a general rule, do not seem very noticeable,\nbecause everything remarkable or exciting surprise is absent. Their\noccurrence is, moreover, a strong argument against the doctrine which\nderives the dream from the isolated activity of certain cortical\nelements. All signs of a lowered or subdivided psychical activity are\nwanting. Yet we never raise any objection to characterizing them as\ndreams, nor do we confound them with the products of our waking life.\nA second group is formed by those dreams which are indeed self-coherent\nand have a distinct meaning, but appear strange because we are unable to\nreconcile their meaning with our mental life. That is the case when we\ndream, for instance, that some dear relative has died of plague when we\nknow of no ground for expecting, apprehending, or assuming anything of\nthe sort; we can only ask ourself wonderingly: \"What brought that into\nmy head?\" To the third group those dreams belong which are void of both\nmeaning and intelligibility; they are _incoherent, complicated, and\nmeaningless_. The overwhelming number of our dreams partake of this\ncharacter, and this has given rise to the contemptuous attitude towards\ndreams and the medical theory of their limited psychical activity. It is\nespecially in the longer and more complicated dream-plots that signs of\nincoherence are seldom missing.\nThe contrast between manifest and latent dream-content is clearly only\nof value for the dreams of the second and more especially for those of\nthe third class. Here are problems which are only solved when the\nmanifest dream is replaced by its latent content; it was an example of\nthis kind, a complicated and unintelligible dream, that we subjected to\nanalysis. Against our expectation we, however, struck upon reasons which\nprevented a complete cognizance of the latent dream thought. On the\nrepetition of this same experience we were forced to the supposition\nthat there is an _intimate bond, with laws of its own, between the\nunintelligible and complicated nature of the dream and the difficulties\nattending communication of the thoughts connected with the dream_.\nBefore investigating the nature of this bond, it will be advantageous to\nturn our attention to the more readily intelligible dreams of the first\nclass where, the manifest and latent content being identical, the dream\nwork seems to be omitted.\nThe investigation of these dreams is also advisable from another\nstandpoint. The dreams of _children_ are of this nature; they have a\nmeaning, and are not bizarre. This, by the way, is a further objection\nto reducing dreams to a dissociation of cerebral activity in sleep, for\nwhy should such a lowering of psychical functions belong to the nature\nof sleep in adults, but not in children? We are, however, fully\njustified in expecting that the explanation of psychical processes in\nchildren, essentially simplified as they may be, should serve as an\nindispensable preparation towards the psychology of the adult.\nI shall therefore cite some examples of dreams which I have gathered\nfrom children. A girl of nineteen months was made to go without food\nfor a day because she had been sick in the morning, and, according to\nnurse, had made herself ill through eating strawberries. During the\nnight, after her day of fasting, she was heard calling out her name\nduring sleep, and adding: \"_Tawberry, eggs, pap_.\" She is dreaming that\nshe is eating, and selects out of her menu exactly what she supposes she\nwill not get much of just now.\nThe same kind of dream about a forbidden dish was that of a little boy\nof twenty-two months. The day before he was told to offer his uncle a\npresent of a small basket of cherries, of which the child was, of\ncourse, only allowed one to taste. He woke up with the joyful news:\n\"Hermann eaten up all the cherries.\"\nA girl of three and a half years had made during the day a sea trip\nwhich was too short for her, and she cried when she had to get out of\nthe boat. The next morning her story was that during the night she had\nbeen on the sea, thus continuing the interrupted trip.\nA boy of five and a half years was not at all pleased with his party\nduring a walk in the Dachstein region. Whenever a new peak came into\nsight he asked if that were the Dachstein, and, finally, refused to\naccompany the party to the waterfall. His behavior was ascribed to\nfatigue; but a better explanation was forthcoming when the next morning\nhe told his dream: _he had ascended the Dachstein_. Obviously he\nexpected the ascent of the Dachstein to be the object of the excursion,\nand was vexed by not getting a glimpse of the mountain. The dream gave\nhim what the day had withheld. The dream of a girl of six was similar;\nher father had cut short the walk before reaching the promised objective\non account of the lateness of the hour. On the way back she noticed a\nsignpost giving the name of another place for excursions; her father\npromised to take her there also some other day. She greeted her father\nnext day with the news that she had dreamt that _her father had been\nwith her to both places_.\nWhat is common in all these dreams is obvious. They completely satisfy\nwishes excited during the day which remain unrealized. They are simply\nand undisguisedly realizations of wishes.\nThe following child-dream, not quite understandable at first sight, is\nnothing else than a wish realized. On account of poliomyelitis a girl,\nnot quite four years of age, was brought from the country into town, and\nremained over night with a childless aunt in a big--for her, naturally,\nhuge--bed. The next morning she stated that she had dreamt that _the\nbed was much too small for her, so that she could find no place in it_.\nTo explain this dream as a wish is easy when we remember that to be\n\"big\" is a frequently expressed wish of all children. The bigness of the\nbed reminded Miss Little-Would-be-Big only too forcibly of her\nsmallness. This nasty situation became righted in her dream, and she\ngrew so big that the bed now became too small for her.\nEven when children's dreams are complicated and polished, their\ncomprehension as a realization of desire is fairly evident. A boy of\neight dreamt that he was being driven with Achilles in a war-chariot,\nguided by Diomedes. The day before he was assiduously reading about\ngreat heroes. It is easy to show that he took these heroes as his\nmodels, and regretted that he was not living in those days.\nFrom this short collection a further characteristic of the dreams of\nchildren is manifest--_their connection with the life of the day_. The\ndesires which are realized in these dreams are left over from the day\nor, as a rule, the day previous, and the feeling has become intently\nemphasized and fixed during the day thoughts. Accidental and indifferent\nmatters, or what must appear so to the child, find no acceptance in the\ncontents of the dream.\nInnumerable instances of such dreams of the infantile type can be found\namong adults also, but, as mentioned, these are mostly exactly like the\nmanifest content. Thus, a random selection of persons will generally\nrespond to thirst at night-time with a dream about drinking, thus\nstriving to get rid of the sensation and to let sleep continue. Many\npersons frequently have these comforting _dreams_ before waking, just\nwhen they are called. They then dream that they are already up, that\nthey are washing, or already in school, at the office, etc., where they\nought to be at a given time. The night before an intended journey one\nnot infrequently dreams that one has already arrived at the destination;\nbefore going to a play or to a party the dream not infrequently\nanticipates, in impatience, as it were, the expected pleasure. At other\ntimes the dream expresses the realization of the desire somewhat\nindirectly; some connection, some sequel must be known--the first step\ntowards recognizing the desire. Thus, when a husband related to me the\ndream of his young wife, that her monthly period had begun, I had to\nbethink myself that the young wife would have expected a pregnancy if\nthe period had been absent. The dream is then a sign of pregnancy. Its\nmeaning is that it shows the wish realized that pregnancy should not\noccur just yet. Under unusual and extreme circumstances, these dreams\nof the infantile type become very frequent. The leader of a polar\nexpedition tells us, for instance, that during the wintering amid the\nice the crew, with their monotonous diet and slight rations, dreamt\nregularly, like children, of fine meals, of mountains of tobacco, and of\nhome.\nIt is not uncommon that out of some long, complicated and intricate\ndream one specially lucid part stands out containing unmistakably the\nrealization of a desire, but bound up with much unintelligible matter.\nOn more frequently analyzing the seemingly more transparent dreams of\nadults, it is astonishing to discover that these are rarely as simple as\nthe dreams of children, and that they cover another meaning beyond that\nof the realization of a wish.\nIt would certainly be a simple and convenient solution of the riddle if\nthe work of analysis made it at all possible for us to trace the\nmeaningless and intricate dreams of adults back to the infantile type,\nto the realization of some intensely experienced desire of the day. But\nthere is no warrant for such an expectation. Their dreams are generally\nfull of the most indifferent and bizarre matter, and no trace of the\nrealization of the wish is to be found in their content.\nBefore leaving these infantile dreams, which are obviously unrealized\ndesires, we must not fail to mention another chief characteristic of\ndreams, one that has been long noticed, and one which stands out most\nclearly in this class. I can replace any of these dreams by a phrase\nexpressing a desire. If the sea trip had only lasted longer; if I were\nonly washed and dressed; if I had only been allowed to keep the cherries\ninstead of giving them to my uncle. But the dream gives something more\nthan the choice, for here the desire is already realized; its\nrealization is real and actual. The dream presentations consist chiefly,\nif not wholly, of scenes and mainly of visual sense images. Hence a kind\nof transformation is not entirely absent in this class of dreams, and\nthis may be fairly designated as the dream work. _An idea merely\nexisting in the region of possibility is replaced by a vision of its\naccomplishment._\nII\nTHE DREAM MECHANISM\nWe are compelled to assume that such transformation of scene has also\ntaken place in intricate dreams, though we do not know whether it has\nencountered any possible desire. The dream instanced at the\ncommencement, which we analyzed somewhat thoroughly, did give us\noccasion in two places to suspect something of the kind. Analysis\nbrought out that my wife was occupied with others at table, and that I\ndid not like it; in the dream itself _exactly the opposite_ occurs, for\nthe person who replaces my wife gives me her undivided attention. But\ncan one wish for anything pleasanter after a disagreeable incident than\nthat the exact contrary should have occurred, just as the dream has it?\nThe stinging thought in the analysis, that I have never had anything for\nnothing, is similarly connected with the woman's remark in the dream:\n\"You have always had such beautiful eyes.\" Some portion of the\nopposition between the latent and manifest content of the dream must be\ntherefore derived from the realization of a wish.\nAnother manifestation of the dream work which all incoherent dreams have\nin common is still more noticeable. Choose any instance, and compare the\nnumber of separate elements in it, or the extent of the dream, if\nwritten down, with the dream thoughts yielded by analysis, and of which\nbut a trace can be refound in the dream itself. There can be no doubt\nthat the dream working has resulted in an extraordinary compression or\n_condensation_. It is not at first easy to form an opinion as to the\nextent of the condensation; the more deeply you go into the analysis,\nthe more deeply you are impressed by it. There will be found no factor\nin the dream whence the chains of associations do not lead in two or\nmore directions, no scene which has not been pieced together out of two\nor more impressions and events. For instance, I once dreamt about a kind\nof swimming-bath where the bathers suddenly separated in all directions;\nat one place on the edge a person stood bending towards one of the\nbathers as if to drag him out. The scene was a composite one, made up\nout of an event that occurred at the time of puberty, and of two\npictures, one of which I had seen just shortly before the dream. The two\npictures were The Surprise in the Bath, from Schwind's Cycle of the\nMelusine (note the bathers suddenly separating), and The Flood, by an\nItalian master. The little incident was that I once witnessed a lady,\nwho had tarried in the swimming-bath until the men's hour, being helped\nout of the water by the swimming-master. The scene in the dream which\nwas selected for analysis led to a whole group of reminiscences, each\none of which had contributed to the dream content. First of all came the\nlittle episode from the time of my courting, of which I have already\nspoken; the pressure of a hand under the table gave rise in the dream to\nthe \"under the table,\" which I had subsequently to find a place for in\nmy recollection. There was, of course, at the time not a word about\n\"undivided attention.\" Analysis taught me that this factor is the\nrealization of a desire through its contradictory and related to the\nbehavior of my wife at the table d'h\u00f4te. An exactly similar and much\nmore important episode of our courtship, one which separated us for an\nentire day, lies hidden behind this recent recollection. The intimacy,\nthe hand resting upon the knee, refers to a quite different connection\nand to quite other persons. This element in the dream becomes again the\nstarting-point of two distinct series of reminiscences, and so on.\nThe stuff of the dream thoughts which has been accumulated for the\nformation of the dream scene must be naturally fit for this application.\nThere must be one or more common factors. The dream work proceeds like\nFrancis Galton with his family photographs. The different elements are\nput one on top of the other; what is common to the composite picture\nstands out clearly, the opposing details cancel each other. This process\nof reproduction partly explains the wavering statements, of a peculiar\nvagueness, in so many elements of the dream. For the interpretation of\ndreams this rule holds good: When analysis discloses _uncertainty_, as\nto _either_--_or_ read _and_, _taking_ each section of the apparent\nalternatives as a separate outlet for a series of impressions.\nWhen there is nothing in common between the dream thoughts, the dream\nwork takes the trouble to create a something, in order to make a common\npresentation feasible in the dream. The simplest way to approximate two\ndream thoughts, which have as yet nothing in common, consists in making\nsuch a change in the actual expression of one idea as will meet a slight\nresponsive recasting in the form of the other idea. The process is\nanalogous to that of rhyme, when consonance supplies the desired common\nfactor. A good deal of the dream work consists in the creation of those\nfrequently very witty, but often exaggerated, digressions. These vary\nfrom the common presentation in the dream content to dream thoughts\nwhich are as varied as are the causes in form and essence which give\nrise to them. In the analysis of our example of a dream, I find a like\ncase of the transformation of a thought in order that it might agree\nwith another essentially foreign one. In following out the analysis I\nstruck upon the thought: _I should like to have something for nothing_.\nBut this formula is not serviceable to the dream. Hence it is replaced\nby another one: \"I should like to enjoy something free of cost.\"[1] The\nword \"kost\" (taste), with its double meaning, is appropriate to a table\nd'h\u00f4te; it, moreover, is in place through the special sense in the\ndream. At home if there is a dish which the children decline, their\nmother first tries gentle persuasion, with a \"Just taste it.\" That the\ndream work should unhesitatingly use the double meaning of the word is\ncertainly remarkable; ample experience has shown, however, that the\noccurrence is quite usual.\nThrough condensation of the dream certain constituent parts of its\ncontent are explicable which are peculiar to the dream life alone, and\nwhich are not found in the waking state. Such are the composite and\nmixed persons, the extraordinary mixed figures, creations comparable\nwith the fantastic animal compositions of Orientals; a moment's thought\nand these are reduced to unity, whilst the fancies of the dream are ever\nformed anew in an inexhaustible profusion. Every one knows such images\nin his own dreams; manifold are their origins. I can build up a person\nby borrowing one feature from one person and one from another, or by\ngiving to the form of one the name of another in my dream. I can also\nvisualize one person, but place him in a position which has occurred to\nanother. There is a meaning in all these cases when different persons\nare amalgamated into one substitute. Such cases denote an \"and,\" a \"just\nlike,\" a comparison of the original person from a certain point of view,\na comparison which can be also realized in the dream itself. As a rule,\nhowever, the identity of the blended persons is only discoverable by\nanalysis, and is only indicated in the dream content by the formation of\nthe \"combined\" person.\nThe same diversity in their ways of formation and the same rules for its\nsolution hold good also for the innumerable medley of dream contents,\nexamples of which I need scarcely adduce. Their strangeness quite\ndisappears when we resolve not to place them on a level with the objects\nof perception as known to us when awake, but to remember that they\nrepresent the art of dream condensation by an exclusion of unnecessary\ndetail. Prominence is given to the common character of the combination.\nAnalysis must also generally supply the common features. The dream says\nsimply: _All these things have an \"x\" in common_. The decomposition of\nthese mixed images by analysis is often the quickest way to an\ninterpretation of the dream. Thus I once dreamt that I was sitting with\none of my former university tutors on a bench, which was undergoing a\nrapid continuous movement amidst other benches. This was a combination\nof lecture-room and moving staircase. I will not pursue the further\nresult of the thought. Another time I was sitting in a carriage, and on\nmy lap an object in shape like a top-hat, which, however, was made of\ntransparent glass. The scene at once brought to my mind the proverb: \"He\nwho keeps his hat in his hand will travel safely through the land.\" By a\nslight turn the _glass hat_ reminded me of _Auer's light_, and I knew\nthat I was about to invent something which was to make me as rich and\nindependent as his invention had made my countryman, Dr. Auer, of\nWelsbach; then I should be able to travel instead of remaining in\nVienna. In the dream I was traveling with my invention, with the, it is\ntrue, rather awkward glass top-hat. The dream work is peculiarly adept\nat representing two contradictory conceptions by means of the same mixed\nimage. Thus, for instance, a woman dreamt of herself carrying a tall\nflower-stalk, as in the picture of the Annunciation (Chastity-Mary is\nher own name), but the stalk was bedecked with thick white blossoms\nresembling camellias (contrast with chastity: La dame aux Camelias).\nA great deal of what we have called \"dream condensation\" can be thus\nformulated. Each one of the elements of the dream content is\n_overdetermined_ by the matter of the dream thoughts; it is not derived\nfrom one element of these thoughts, but from a whole series. These are\nnot necessarily interconnected in any way, but may belong to the most\ndiverse spheres of thought. The dream element truly represents all this\ndisparate matter in the dream content. Analysis, moreover, discloses\nanother side of the relationship between dream content and dream\nthoughts. Just as one element of the dream leads to associations with\nseveral dream thoughts, so, as a rule, the _one dream thought represents\nmore than one dream element_. The threads of the association do not\nsimply converge from the dream thoughts to the dream content, but on the\nway they overlap and interweave in every way.\nNext to the transformation of one thought in the scene (its\n\"dramatization\"), condensation is the most important and most\ncharacteristic feature of the dream work. We have as yet no clue as to\nthe motive calling for such compression of the content.\nIn the complicated and intricate dreams with which we are now concerned,\ncondensation and dramatization do not wholly account for the difference\nbetween dream contents and dream thoughts. There is evidence of a third\nfactor, which deserves careful consideration.\nWhen I have arrived at an understanding of the dream thoughts by my\nanalysis I notice, above all, that the matter of the manifest is very\ndifferent from that of the latent dream content. That is, I admit, only\nan apparent difference which vanishes on closer investigation, for in\nthe end I find the whole dream content carried out in the dream\nthoughts, nearly all the dream thoughts again represented in the dream\ncontent. Nevertheless, there does remain a certain amount of difference.\nThe essential content which stood out clearly and broadly in the dream\nmust, after analysis, rest satisfied with a very subordinate r\u00f4le among\nthe dream thoughts. These very dream thoughts which, going by my\nfeelings, have a claim to the greatest importance are either not present\nat all in the dream content, or are represented by some remote allusion\nin some obscure region of the dream. I can thus describe these\nphenomena: _During the dream work the psychical intensity of those\nthoughts and conceptions to which it properly pertains flows to others\nwhich, in my judgment, have no claim to such emphasis_. There is no\nother process which contributes so much to concealment of the dream's\nmeaning and to make the connection between the dream content and dream\nideas irrecognizable. During this process, which I will call _the dream\ndisplacement_, I notice also the psychical intensity, significance, or\nemotional nature of the thoughts become transposed in sensory vividness.\nWhat was clearest in the dream seems to me, without further\nconsideration, the most important; but often in some obscure element of\nthe dream I can recognize the most direct offspring of the principal\ndream thought.\nI could only designate this dream displacement as the _transvaluation of\npsychical values_. The phenomena will not have been considered in all\nits bearings unless I add that this displacement or transvaluation is\nshared by different dreams in extremely varying degrees. There are\ndreams which take place almost without any displacement. These have the\nsame time, meaning, and intelligibility as we found in the dreams which\nrecorded a desire. In other dreams not a bit of the dream idea has\nretained its own psychical value, or everything essential in these dream\nideas has been replaced by unessentials, whilst every kind of transition\nbetween these conditions can be found. The more obscure and intricate a\ndream is, the greater is the part to be ascribed to the impetus of\ndisplacement in its formation.\nThe example that we chose for analysis shows, at least, this much of\ndisplacement--that its content has a different center of interest from\nthat of the dream ideas. In the forefront of the dream content the main\nscene appears as if a woman wished to make advances to me; in the dream\nidea the chief interest rests on the desire to enjoy disinterested love\nwhich shall \"cost nothing\"; this idea lies at the back of the talk about\nthe beautiful eyes and the far-fetched allusion to \"spinach.\"\nIf we abolish the dream displacement, we attain through analysis quite\ncertain conclusions regarding two problems of the dream which are most\ndisputed--as to what provokes a dream at all, and as to the connection\nof the dream with our waking life. There are dreams which at once expose\ntheir links with the events of the day; in others no trace of such a\nconnection can be found. By the aid of analysis it can be shown that\nevery dream, without any exception, is linked up with our impression of\nthe day, or perhaps it would be more correct to say of the day previous\nto the dream. The impressions which have incited the dream may be so\nimportant that we are not surprised at our being occupied with them\nwhilst awake; in this case we are right in saying that the dream carries\non the chief interest of our waking life. More usually, however, when\nthe dream contains anything relating to the impressions of the day, it\nis so trivial, unimportant, and so deserving of oblivion, that we can\nonly recall it with an effort. The dream content appears, then, even\nwhen coherent and intelligible, to be concerned with those indifferent\ntrifles of thought undeserving of our waking interest. The depreciation\nof dreams is largely due to the predominance of the indifferent and the\nworthless in their content.\nAnalysis destroys the appearance upon which this derogatory judgment is\nbased. When the dream content discloses nothing but some indifferent\nimpression as instigating the dream, analysis ever indicates some\nsignificant event, which has been replaced by something indifferent\nwith which it has entered into abundant associations. Where the dream is\nconcerned with uninteresting and unimportant conceptions, analysis\nreveals the numerous associative paths which connect the trivial with\nthe momentous in the psychical estimation of the individual. _It is only\nthe action of displacement if what is indifferent obtains recognition in\nthe dream content instead of those impressions which are really the\nstimulus, or instead of the things of real interest_. In answering the\nquestion as to what provokes the dream, as to the connection of the\ndream, in the daily troubles, we must say, in terms of the insight given\nus by replacing the manifest latent dream content: _The dream does never\ntrouble itself about things which are not deserving of our concern\nduring the day, and trivialities which do not trouble us during the day\nhave no power to pursue us whilst asleep_.\nWhat provoked the dream in the example which we have analyzed? The\nreally unimportant event, that a friend invited me to a _free ride in\nhis cab_. The table d'h\u00f4te scene in the dream contains an allusion to\nthis indifferent motive, for in conversation I had brought the taxi\nparallel with the table d'h\u00f4te. But I can indicate the important event\nwhich has as its substitute the trivial one. A few days before I had\ndisbursed a large sum of money for a member of my family who is very\ndear to me. Small wonder, says the dream thought, if this person is\ngrateful to me for this--this love is not cost-free. But love that shall\ncost nothing is one of the prime thoughts of the dream. The fact that\nshortly before this I had had several _drives_ with the relative in\nquestion puts the one drive with my friend in a position to recall the\nconnection with the other person. The indifferent impression which, by\nsuch ramifications, provokes the dream is subservient to another\ncondition which is not true of the real source of the dream--the\nimpression must be a recent one, everything arising from the day of the\ndream.\nI cannot leave the question of dream displacement without the\nconsideration of a remarkable process in the formation of dreams in\nwhich condensation and displacement work together towards one end. In\ncondensation we have already considered the case where two conceptions\nin the dream having something in common, some point of contact, are\nreplaced in the dream content by a mixed image, where the distinct germ\ncorresponds to what is common, and the indistinct secondary\nmodifications to what is distinctive. If displacement is added to\ncondensation, there is no formation of a mixed image, but a _common\nmean_ which bears the same relationship to the individual elements as\ndoes the resultant in the parallelogram of forces to its components. In\none of my dreams, for instance, there is talk of an injection with\n_propyl_. On first analysis I discovered an indifferent but true\nincident where _amyl_ played a part as the excitant of the dream. I\ncannot yet vindicate the exchange of amyl for propyl. To the round of\nideas of the same dream, however, there belongs the recollection of my\nfirst visit to Munich, when the _Propyloea_ struck me. The attendant\ncircumstances of the analysis render it admissible that the influence of\nthis second group of conceptions caused the displacement of amyl to\npropyl. _Propyl_ is, so to say, the mean idea between _amyl_ and\n_propyloea_; it got into the dream as a kind of _compromise_ by\nsimultaneous condensation and displacement.\nThe need of discovering some motive for this bewildering work of the\ndream is even more called for in the case of displacement than in\ncondensation.\nAlthough the work of displacement must be held mainly responsible if the\ndream thoughts are not refound or recognized in the dream content\n(unless the motive of the changes be guessed), it is another and milder\nkind of transformation which will be considered with the dream thoughts\nwhich leads to the discovery of a new but readily understood act of the\ndream work. The first dream thoughts which are unravelled by analysis\nfrequently strike one by their unusual wording. They do not appear to be\nexpressed in the sober form which our thinking prefers; rather are they\nexpressed symbolically by allegories and metaphors like the figurative\nlanguage of the poets. It is not difficult to find the motives for this\ndegree of constraint in the expression of dream ideas. The dream content\nconsists chiefly of visual scenes; hence the dream ideas must, in the\nfirst place, be prepared to make use of these forms of presentation.\nConceive that a political leader's or a barrister's address had to be\ntransposed into pantomime, and it will be easy to understand the\ntransformations to which the dream work is constrained by regard for\nthis _dramatization of the dream content_.\nAround the psychical stuff of dream thoughts there are ever found\nreminiscences of impressions, not infrequently of early\nchildhood--scenes which, as a rule, have been visually grasped. Whenever\npossible, this portion of the dream ideas exercises a definite influence\nupon the modelling of the dream content; it works like a center of\ncrystallization, by attracting and rearranging the stuff of the dream\nthoughts. The scene of the dream is not infrequently nothing but a\nmodified repetition, complicated by interpolations of events that have\nleft such an impression; the dream but very seldom reproduces accurate\nand unmixed reproductions of real scenes.\nThe dream content does not, however, consist exclusively of scenes, but\nit also includes scattered fragments of visual images, conversations,\nand even bits of unchanged thoughts. It will be perhaps to the point if\nwe instance in the briefest way the means of dramatization which are at\nthe disposal of the dream work for the repetition of the dream thoughts\nin the peculiar language of the dream.\nThe dream thoughts which we learn from the analysis exhibit themselves\nas a psychical complex of the most complicated superstructure. Their\nparts stand in the most diverse relationship to each other; they form\nbackgrounds and foregrounds, stipulations, digressions, illustrations,\ndemonstrations, and protestations. It may be said to be almost the rule\nthat one train of thought is followed by its contradictory. No feature\nknown to our reason whilst awake is absent. If a dream is to grow out of\nall this, the psychical matter is submitted to a pressure which\ncondenses it extremely, to an inner shrinking and displacement, creating\nat the same time fresh surfaces, to a selective interweaving among the\nconstituents best adapted for the construction of these scenes. Having\nregard to the origin of this stuff, the term _regression_ can be fairly\napplied to this process. The logical chains which hitherto held the\npsychical stuff together become lost in this transformation to the dream\ncontent. The dream work takes on, as it were, only the essential content\nof the dream thoughts for elaboration. It is left to analysis to restore\nthe connection which the dream work has destroyed.\nThe dream's means of expression must therefore be regarded as meager in\ncomparison with those of our imagination, though the dream does not\nrenounce all claims to the restitution of logical relation to the dream\nthoughts. It rather succeeds with tolerable frequency in replacing these\nby formal characters of its own.\nBy reason of the undoubted connection existing between all the parts of\ndream thoughts, the dream is able to embody this matter into a single\nscene. It upholds a _logical connection_ as _approximation in time and\nspace_, just as the painter, who groups all the poets for his picture of\nParnassus who, though they have never been all together on a mountain\npeak, yet form ideally a community. The dream continues this method of\npresentation in individual dreams, and often when it displays two\nelements close together in the dream content it warrants some special\ninner connection between what they represent in the dream thoughts. It\nshould be, moreover, observed that all the dreams of one night prove on\nanalysis to originate from the same sphere of thought.\nThe causal connection between two ideas is either left without\npresentation, or replaced by two different long portions of dreams one\nafter the other. This presentation is frequently a reversed one, the\nbeginning of the dream being the deduction, and its end the hypothesis.\nThe direct _transformation_ of one thing into another in the dream seems\nto serve the relationship of _cause_ and _effect_.\nThe dream never utters the _alternative \"either-or,\"_ but accepts both\nas having equal rights in the same connection. When \"either-or\" is used\nin the reproduction of dreams, it is, as I have already mentioned, to be\nreplaced by \"_and_.\"\nConceptions which stand in opposition to one another are preferably\nexpressed in dreams by the same element.[2] There seems no \"not\" in\ndreams. Opposition between two ideas, the relation of conversion, is\nrepresented in dreams in a very remarkable way. It is expressed by the\nreversal of another part of the dream content just as if by way of\nappendix. We shall later on deal with another form of expressing\ndisagreement. The common dream sensation of _movement checked_ serves\nthe purpose of representing disagreement of impulses--a _conflict of the\nwill_.\nOnly one of the logical relationships--that of _similarity, identity,\nagreement_--is found highly developed in the mechanism of dream\nformation. Dream work makes use of these cases as a starting-point for\ncondensation, drawing together everything which shows such agreement to\na _fresh unity_.\nThese short, crude observations naturally do not suffice as an estimate\nof the abundance of the dream's formal means of presenting the logical\nrelationships of the dream thoughts. In this respect, individual dreams\nare worked up more nicely or more carelessly, our text will have been\nfollowed more or less closely, auxiliaries of the dream work will have\nbeen taken more or less into consideration. In the latter case they\nappear obscure, intricate, incoherent. When the dream appears openly\nabsurd, when it contains an obvious paradox in its content, it is so of\npurpose. Through its apparent disregard of all logical claims, it\nexpresses a part of the intellectual content of the dream ideas.\nAbsurdity in the dream denotes _disagreement, scorn, disdain_ in the\ndream thoughts. As this explanation is in entire disagreement with the\nview that the dream owes its origin to dissociated, uncritical cerebral\nactivity, I will emphasize my view by an example:\n_\"One of my acquaintances, Mr. M----, has been attacked by no less a\nperson than Goethe in an essay with, we all maintain, unwarrantable\nviolence. Mr. M---- has naturally been ruined by this attack. He\ncomplains very bitterly of this at a dinner-party, but his respect for\nGoethe has not diminished through this personal experience. I now\nattempt to clear up the chronological relations which strike me as\nimprobable. Goethe died in 1832. As his attack upon Mr. M---- must, of\ncourse, have taken place before, Mr. M---- must have been then a very\nyoung man. It seems to me plausible that he was eighteen. I am not\ncertain, however, what year we are actually in, and the whole\ncalculation falls into obscurity. The attack was, moreover, contained\nin Goethe's well-known essay on 'Nature.'\"_\nThe absurdity of the dream becomes the more glaring when I state that\nMr. M---- is a young business man without any poetical or literary\ninterests. My analysis of the dream will show what method there is in\nthis madness. The dream has derived its material from three sources:\n1. Mr. M----, to whom I was introduced at a dinner-party, begged me one\nday to examine his elder brother, who showed signs of mental trouble. In\nconversation with the patient, an unpleasant episode occurred. Without\nthe slightest occasion he disclosed one of his brother's _youthful\nescapades_. I had asked the patient the _year of his birth_ (_year of\ndeath_ in dream), and led him to various calculations which might show\nup his want of memory.\n2. A medical journal which displayed my name among others on the cover\nhad published a _ruinous_ review of a book by my friend F---- of Berlin,\nfrom the pen of a very _juvenile_ reviewer. I communicated with the\neditor, who, indeed, expressed his regret, but would not promise any\nredress. Thereupon I broke off my connection with the paper; in my\nletter of resignation I expressed the hope that our _personal relations\nwould not suffer from this_. Here is the real source of the dream. The\nderogatory reception of my friend's work had made a deep impression upon\nme. In my judgment, it contained a fundamental biological discovery\nwhich only now, several years later, commences to find favor among the\nprofessors.\n3. A little while before, a patient gave me the medical history of her\nbrother, who, exclaiming \"_Nature, Nature!_\" had gone out of his mind.\nThe doctors considered that the exclamation arose from a study of\n_Goethe's_ beautiful essay, and indicated that the patient had been\noverworking. I expressed the opinion that it seemed more _plausible_ to\nme that the exclamation \"Nature!\" was to be taken in that sexual meaning\nknown also to the less educated in our country. It seemed to me that\nthis view had something in it, because the unfortunate youth afterwards\nmutilated his genital organs. The patient was eighteen years old when\nthe attack occurred.\nThe first person in the dream-thoughts behind the ego was my friend who\nhad been so scandalously treated. _\"I now attempted to clear up the\nchronological relation.\"_ My friend's book deals with the chronological\nrelations of life, and, amongst other things, correlates _Goethe's_\nduration of life with a number of days in many ways important to\nbiology. The ego is, however, represented as a general paralytic (_\"I\nam not certain what year we are actually in\"_). The dream exhibits my\nfriend as behaving like a general paralytic, and thus riots in\nabsurdity. But the dream thoughts run ironically. \"Of course he is a\nmadman, a fool, and you are the genius who understands all about it. But\nshouldn't it be the _other way round_?\" This inversion obviously took\nplace in the dream when Goethe attacked the young man, which is absurd,\nwhilst any one, however young, can to-day easily attack the great\nGoethe.\nI am prepared to maintain that no dream is inspired by other than\negoistic emotions. The ego in the dream does not, indeed, represent only\nmy friend, but stands for myself also. I identify myself with him\nbecause the fate of his discovery appears to me typical of the\nacceptance of _my own_. If I were to publish my own theory, which gives\nsexuality predominance in the \u00e6tiology of psychoneurotic disorders (see\nthe allusion to the eighteen-year-old patient--_\"Nature, Nature!\"_), the\nsame criticism would be leveled at me, and it would even now meet with\nthe same contempt.\nWhen I follow out the dream thoughts closely, I ever find only _scorn_\nand _contempt_ as _correlated with the dream's absurdity_. It is well\nknown that the discovery of a cracked sheep's skull on the Lido in\nVenice gave Goethe the hint for the so-called vertebral theory of the\nskull. My friend plumes himself on having as a student raised a hubbub\nfor the resignation of an aged professor who had done good work\n(including some in this very subject of comparative anatomy), but who,\non account of _decrepitude_, had become quite incapable of teaching. The\nagitation my friend inspired was so successful because in the German\nUniversities an _age limit_ is not demanded for academic work. _Age is\nno protection against folly._ In the hospital here I had for years the\nhonor to serve under a chief who, long fossilized, was for decades\nnotoriously _feebleminded_, and was yet permitted to continue in his\nresponsible office. A trait, after the manner of the find in the Lido,\nforces itself upon me here. It was to this man that some youthful\ncolleagues in the hospital adapted the then popular slang of that day:\n\"No Goethe has written that,\" \"No Schiller composed that,\" etc.\nWe have not exhausted our valuation of the dream work. In addition to\ncondensation, displacement, and definite arrangement of the psychical\nmatter, we must ascribe to it yet another activity--one which is,\nindeed, not shared by every dream. I shall not treat this position of\nthe dream work exhaustively; I will only point out that the readiest\nway to arrive at a conception of it is to take for granted, probably\nunfairly, that it _only subsequently influences the dream content which\nhas already been built up_. Its mode of action thus consists in so\nco\u00f6rdinating the parts of the dream that these coalesce to a coherent\nwhole, to a dream composition. The dream gets a kind of fa\u00e7ade which, it\nis true, does not conceal the whole of its content. There is a sort of\npreliminary explanation to be strengthened by interpolations and slight\nalterations. Such elaboration of the dream content must not be too\npronounced; the misconception of the dream thoughts to which it gives\nrise is merely superficial, and our first piece of work in analyzing a\ndream is to get rid of these early attempts at interpretation.\nThe motives for this part of the dream work are easily gauged. This\nfinal elaboration of the dream is due to a _regard for\nintelligibility_--a fact at once betraying the origin of an action which\nbehaves towards the actual dream content just as our normal psychical\naction behaves towards some proffered perception that is to our liking.\nThe dream content is thus secured under the pretense of certain\nexpectations, is perceptually classified by the supposition of its\nintelligibility, thereby risking its falsification, whilst, in fact, the\nmost extraordinary misconceptions arise if the dream can be correlated\nwith nothing familiar. Every one is aware that we are unable to look at\nany series of unfamiliar signs, or to listen to a discussion of unknown\nwords, without at once making perpetual changes through _our regard for\nintelligibility_, through our falling back upon what is familiar.\nWe can call those dreams _properly made up_ which are the result of an\nelaboration in every way analogous to the psychical action of our waking\nlife. In other dreams there is no such action; not even an attempt is\nmade to bring about order and meaning. We regard the dream as \"quite\nmad,\" because on awaking it is with this last-named part of the dream\nwork, the dream elaboration, that we identify ourselves. So far,\nhowever, as our analysis is concerned, the dream, which resembles a\nmedley of disconnected fragments, is of as much value as the one with a\nsmooth and beautifully polished surface. In the former case we are\nspared, to some extent, the trouble of breaking down the\nsuper-elaboration of the dream content.\nAll the same, it would be an error to see in the dream fa\u00e7ade nothing\nbut the misunderstood and somewhat arbitrary elaboration of the dream\ncarried out at the instance of our psychical life. Wishes and phantasies\nare not infrequently employed in the erection of this fa\u00e7ade, which\nwere already fashioned in the dream thoughts; they are akin to those of\nour waking life--\"day-dreams,\" as they are very properly called. These\nwishes and phantasies, which analysis discloses in our dreams at night,\noften present themselves as repetitions and refashionings of the scenes\nof infancy. Thus the dream fa\u00e7ade may show us directly the true core of\nthe dream, distorted through admixture with other matter.\nBeyond these four activities there is nothing else to be discovered in\nthe dream work. If we keep closely to the definition that dream work\ndenotes the transference of dream thoughts to dream content, we are\ncompelled to say that the dream work is not creative; it develops no\nfancies of its own, it judges nothing, decides nothing. It does nothing\nbut prepare the matter for condensation and displacement, and refashions\nit for dramatization, to which must be added the inconstant last-named\nmechanism--that of explanatory elaboration. It is true that a good deal\nis found in the dream content which might be understood as the result of\nanother and more intellectual performance; but analysis shows\nconclusively every time that these _intellectual operations were already\npresent in the dream thoughts, and have only been taken over by the\ndream content_. A syllogism in the dream is nothing other than the\nrepetition of a syllogism in the dream thoughts; it seems inoffensive if\nit has been transferred to the dream without alteration; it becomes\nabsurd if in the dream work it has been transferred to other matter. A\ncalculation in the dream content simply means that there was a\ncalculation in the dream thoughts; whilst this is always correct, the\ncalculation in the dream can furnish the silliest results by the\ncondensation of its factors and the displacement of the same operations\nto other things. Even speeches which are found in the dream content are\nnot new compositions; they prove to be pieced together out of speeches\nwhich have been made or heard or read; the words are faithfully copied,\nbut the occasion of their utterance is quite overlooked, and their\nmeaning is most violently changed.\nIt is, perhaps, not superfluous to support these assertions by examples:\n1. _A seemingly inoffensive, well-made dream of a patient. She was going\nto market with her cook, who carried the basket. The butcher said to her\nwhen she asked him for something: \"That is all gone,\" and wished to give\nher something else, remarking; \"That's very good.\" She declines, and\ngoes to the greengrocer, who wants to sell her a peculiar vegetable\nwhich is bound up in bundles and of a black color. She says: \"I don't\nknow that; I won't take it.\"_\nThe remark \"That is all gone\" arose from the treatment. A few days\nbefore I said myself to the patient that the earliest reminiscences of\nchildhood _are all gone_ as such, but are replaced by transferences and\ndreams. Thus I am the butcher.\nThe second remark, _\"I don't know that\"_ arose in a very different\nconnection. The day before she had herself called out in rebuke to the\ncook (who, moreover, also appears in the dream): \"_Behave yourself\nproperly_; I don't know _that_\"--that is, \"I don't know this kind of\nbehavior; I won't have it.\" The more harmless portion of this speech was\narrived at by a displacement of the dream content; in the dream thoughts\nonly the other portion of the speech played a part, because the dream\nwork changed an imaginary situation into utter irrecognizability and\ncomplete inoffensiveness (while in a certain sense I behave in an\nunseemly way to the lady). The situation resulting in this phantasy is,\nhowever, nothing but a new edition of one that actually took place.\n2. A dream apparently meaningless relates to figures. _\"She wants to pay\nsomething; her daughter takes three florins sixty-five kreuzers out of\nher purse; but she says: 'What are you doing? It only cost twenty-one\nkreuzers.'\"_\nThe dreamer was a stranger who had placed her child at school in Vienna,\nand who was able to continue under my treatment so long as her daughter\nremained at Vienna. The day before the dream the directress of the\nschool had recommended her to keep the child another year at school. In\nthis case she would have been able to prolong her treatment by one year.\nThe figures in the dream become important if it be remembered that time\nis money. One year equals 365 days, or, expressed in kreuzers, 365\nkreuzers, which is three florins sixty-five kreuzers. The twenty-one\nkreuzers correspond with the three weeks which remained from the day of\nthe dream to the end of the school term, and thus to the end of the\ntreatment. It was obviously financial considerations which had moved the\nlady to refuse the proposal of the directress, and which were answerable\nfor the triviality of the amount in the dream.\n3. A lady, young, but already ten years married, heard that a friend of\nhers, Miss Elise L----, of about the same age, had become engaged. This\ngave rise to the following dream:\n_She was sitting with her husband in the theater; the one side of the\nstalls was quite empty. Her husband tells her, Elise L---- and her\nfianc\u00e9 had intended coming, but could only get some cheap seats, three\nfor one florin fifty kreuzers, and these they would not take. In her\nopinion, that would not have mattered very much._\nThe origin of the figures from the matter of the dream thoughts and the\nchanges the figures underwent are of interest. Whence came the one\nflorin fifty kreuzers? From a trifling occurrence of the previous day.\nHer sister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from her\nhusband, and had quickly got rid of it by buying some ornament. Note\nthat 150 florins is one hundred times one florin fifty kreuzers. For the\n_three_ concerned with the tickets, the only link is that Elise L---- is\nexactly three months younger than the dreamer. The scene in the dream is\nthe repetition of a little adventure for which she has often been teased\nby her husband. She was once in a great hurry to get tickets in time for\na piece, and when she came to the theater _one side of the stalls was\nalmost empty_. It was therefore quite unnecessary for her to have been\nin _such a hurry_. Nor must we overlook the absurdity of the dream that\ntwo persons should take three tickets for the theater.\nNow for the dream ideas. It was _stupid_ to have married so early; I\n_need not_ have been _in so great a hurry_. Elise L----'s example shows\nme that I should have been able to get a husband later; indeed, one a\n_hundred times better_ if I had but waited. I could have bought _three_\nsuch men with the money (dowry).\n[1] \"Ich m\u00f6chte gerne etwas geniessen ohne 'Kosten' zu haben.\" A a pun\nupon the word \"kosten,\" which has two meanings--\"taste\" and \"cost.\" In\n\"Die Traumdeutung,\" third edition, p. 71 footnote, Professor Freud\nremarks that \"the finest example of dream interpretation left us by the\nancients is based upon a pun\" (from \"The Interpretation of Dreams,\" by\nArtemidorus Daldianus). \"Moreover, dreams are so intimately bound up\nwith language that Ferenczi truly points out that every tongue has its\nown language of dreams. A dream is as a rule untranslatable into other\nlanguages.\"--TRANSLATOR.\n[2] It is worthy of remark that eminent philologists maintain that the\noldest languages used the same word for expressing quite general\nantitheses.

Abel's essay, \"Ueber den Gegensinn der Urworter\"\n(1884, the following examples of such words in England are given:\n\"gleam--gloom\"; \"to lock--loch\"; \"down--The Downs\"; \"to step--to stop.\"\nIn his essay on \"The Origin of Language\" (\"Linguistic Essays,\" p. 240),\nAbel says: \"When the Englishman says 'without,' is not his judgment\nbased upon the comparative juxtaposition of two opposites, 'with' and\n'out'; 'with' itself originally meant 'without,' as may still be seen in\n'withdraw.'

To the dream work has been\ntransferred that bewilderment which its product, the dream, has aroused\nin us. In truth, the dream work is only the first recognition of a group\nof psychical processes to which must be referred the origin of\nhysterical symptoms, the ideas of morbid dread, obsession, and illusion.\nCondensation, and especially displacement, are never-failing features in\nthese other processes. The regard for appearance remains, on the other\nhand, peculiar to the dream work. If this explanation brings the dream\ninto line with the formation of psychical disease, it becomes the more\nimportant to fathom the essential conditions of processes like dream\nbuilding. It will be probably a surprise to hear that neither the state\nof sleep nor illness is among the indispensable conditions. A whole\nnumber of phenomena of the everyday life of healthy persons,\nforgetfulness, slips in speaking and in holding things, together with a\ncertain class of mistakes, are due to a psychical mechanism analogous to\nthat of the dream and the other members of this group.\nDisplacement is the core of the problem, and the most striking of all\nthe dream performances. A thorough investigation of the subject shows\nthat the essential condition of displacement is purely psychological; it\nis in the nature of a motive. We get on the track by thrashing out\nexperiences which one cannot avoid in the analysis of dreams. I had to\nbreak off the relations of my dream thoughts in the analysis of my dream\non p. 8 because I found some experiences which I do not wish strangers\nto know, and which I could not relate without serious damage to\nimportant considerations. I added, it would be no use were I to select\nanother instead of that particular dream; in every dream where the\ncontent is obscure or intricate, I should hit upon dream thoughts which\ncall for secrecy. If, however, I continue the analysis for myself,\nwithout regard to those others, for whom, indeed, so personal an event\nas my dream cannot matter, I arrive finally at ideas which surprise me,\nwhich I have not known to be mine, which not only appear _foreign_ to\nme, but which are _unpleasant_, and which I would like to oppose\nvehemently, whilst the chain of ideas running through the analysis\nintrudes upon me inexorably. I can only take these circumstances into\naccount by admitting that these thoughts are actually part of my\npsychical life, possessing a certain psychical intensity or energy.\nHowever, by virtue of a particular psychological condition, the\n_thoughts could not become conscious to me_. I call this particular\ncondition \"_Repression_.\" It is therefore impossible for me not to\nrecognize some casual relationship between the obscurity of the dream\ncontent and this state of repression--this _incapacity of\nconsciousness_. Whence I conclude that the cause of the obscurity is\n_the desire to conceal these thoughts_. Thus I arrive at the conception\nof the _dream distortion_ as the deed of the dream work, and of\n_displacement_ serving to disguise this object.\nI will test this in my own dream, and ask myself, What is the thought\nwhich, quite innocuous in its distorted form, provokes my liveliest\nopposition in its real form? I remember that the free drive reminded me\nof the last expensive drive with a member of my family, the\ninterpretation of the dream being: I should for once like to experience\naffection for which I should not have to pay, and that shortly before\nthe dream I had to make a heavy disbursement for this very person. In\nthis connection, I cannot get away from the thought _that I regret this\ndisbursement_. It is only when I acknowledge this feeling that there is\nany sense in my wishing in the dream for an affection that should entail\nno outlay. And yet I can state on my honor that I did not hesitate for a\nmoment when it became necessary to expend that sum. The regret, the\ncounter-current, was unconscious to me. Why it was unconscious is quite\nanother question which would lead us far away from the answer which,\nthough within my knowledge, belongs elsewhere.\nIf I subject the dream of another person instead of one of my own to\nanalysis, the result is the same; the motives for convincing others is,\nhowever, changed. In the dream of a healthy person the only way for me\nto enable him to accept this repressed idea is the coherence of the\ndream thoughts. He is at liberty to reject this explanation. But if we\nare dealing with a person suffering from any neurosis--say from\nhysteria--the recognition of these repressed ideas is compulsory by\nreason of their connection with the symptoms of his illness and of the\nimprovement resulting from exchanging the symptoms for the repressed\nideas. Take the patient from whom I got the last dream about the three\ntickets for one florin fifty kreuzers. Analysis shows that she does not\nthink highly of her husband, that she regrets having married him, that\nshe would be glad to change him for some one else. It is true that she\nmaintains that she loves her husband, that her emotional life knows\nnothing about this depreciation (a hundred times better!), but all her\nsymptoms lead to the same conclusion as this dream. When her repressed\nmemories had rewakened a certain period when she was conscious that she\ndid not love her husband, her symptoms disappeared, and therewith\ndisappeared her resistance to the interpretation of the dream.\nThis conception of repression once fixed, together with the distortion\nof the dream in relation to repressed psychical matter, we are in a\nposition to give a general exposition of the principal results which the\nanalysis of dreams supplies. We learnt that the most intelligible and\nmeaningful dreams are unrealized desires; the desires they pictured as\nrealized are known to consciousness, have been held over from the\ndaytime, and are of absorbing interest. The analysis of obscure and\nintricate dreams discloses something very similar; the dream scene again\npictures as realized some desire which regularly proceeds from the dream\nideas, but the picture is unrecognizable, and is only cleared up in the\nanalysis. The desire itself is either one repressed, foreign to\nconsciousness, or it is closely bound up with repressed ideas. The\nformula for these dreams may be thus stated: _They are concealed\nrealizations of repressed desires_. It is interesting to note that they\nare right who regard the dream as foretelling the future. Although the\nfuture which the dream shows us is not that which will occur, but that\nwhich we would like to occur. Folk psychology proceeds here according to\nits wont; it believes what it wishes to believe.\nDreams can be divided into three classes according to their relation\ntowards the realization of desire. Firstly come those which exhibit a\n_non-repressed, non-concealed desire_; these are dreams of the infantile\ntype, becoming ever rarer among adults. Secondly, dreams which express\nin _veiled_ form some _repressed desire_; these constitute by far the\nlarger number of our dreams, and they require analysis for their\nunderstanding. Thirdly, these dreams where repression exists, but\n_without_ or with but slight concealment. These dreams are invariably\naccompanied by a feeling of dread which brings the dream to an end. This\nfeeling of dread here replaces dream displacement; I regarded the dream\nwork as having prevented this in the dream of the second class. It is\nnot very difficult to prove that what is now present as intense dread in\nthe dream was once desire, and is now secondary to the repression.\nThere are also definite dreams with a painful content, without the\npresence of any anxiety in the dream. These cannot be reckoned among\ndreams of dread; they have, however, always been used to prove the\nunimportance and the psychical futility of dreams. An analysis of such\nan example will show that it belongs to our second class of dreams--a\n_perfectly concealed_ realization of repressed desires. Analysis will\ndemonstrate at the same time how excellently adapted is the work of\ndisplacement to the concealment of desires.\nA girl dreamt that she saw lying dead before her the only surviving\nchild of her sister amid the same surroundings as a few years before she\nsaw the first child lying dead. She was not sensible of any pain, but\nnaturally combatted the view that the scene represented a desire of\nhers. Nor was that view necessary. Years ago it was at the funeral of\nthe child that she had last seen and spoken to the man she loved. Were\nthe second child to die, she would be sure to meet this man again in her\nsister's house. She is longing to meet him, but struggles against this\nfeeling. The day of the dream she had taken a ticket for a lecture,\nwhich announced the presence of the man she always loved. The dream is\nsimply a dream of impatience common to those which happen before a\njourney, theater, or simply anticipated pleasures. The longing is\nconcealed by the shifting of the scene to the occasion when any joyous\nfeeling were out of place, and yet where it did once exist. Note,\nfurther, that the emotional behavior in the dream is adapted, not to the\ndisplaced, but to the real but suppressed dream ideas. The scene\nanticipates the long-hoped-for meeting; there is here no call for\npainful emotions.\nThere has hitherto been no occasion for philosophers to bestir\nthemselves with a psychology of repression. We must be allowed to\nconstruct some clear conception as to the origin of dreams as the first\nsteps in this unknown territory. The scheme which we have formulated not\nonly from a study of dreams is, it is true, already somewhat\ncomplicated, but we cannot find any simpler one that will suffice. We\nhold that our psychical apparatus contains two procedures for the\nconstruction of thoughts. The second one has the advantage that its\nproducts find an open path to consciousness, whilst the activity of the\nfirst procedure is unknown to itself, and can only arrive at\nconsciousness through the second one. At the borderland of these two\nprocedures, where the first passes over into the second, a censorship\nis established which only passes what pleases it, keeping back\neverything else. That which is rejected by the censorship is, according\nto our definition, in a state of repression. Under certain conditions,\none of which is the sleeping state, the balance of power between the two\nprocedures is so changed that what is repressed can no longer be kept\nback. In the sleeping state this may possibly occur through the\nnegligence of the censor; what has been hitherto repressed will now\nsucceed in finding its way to consciousness. But as the censorship is\nnever absent, but merely off guard, certain alterations must be conceded\nso as to placate it. It is a compromise which becomes conscious in this\ncase--a compromise between what one procedure has in view and the\ndemands of the other. _Repression, laxity of the censor,\ncompromise_--this is the foundation for the origin of many another\npsychological process, just as it is for the dream. In such compromises\nwe can observe the processes of condensation, of displacement, the\nacceptance of superficial associations, which we have found in the dream\nwork.\nIt is not for us to deny the demonic element which has played a part in\nconstructing our explanation of dream work. The impression left is that\nthe formation of obscure dreams proceeds as if a person had something\nto say which must be agreeable for another person upon whom he is\ndependent to hear. It is by the use of this image that we figure to\nourselves the conception of the _dream distortion_ and of the\ncensorship, and ventured to crystallize our impression in a rather\ncrude, but at least definite, psychological theory. Whatever explanation\nthe future may offer of these first and second procedures, we shall\nexpect a confirmation of our correlate that the second procedure\ncommands the entrance to consciousness, and can exclude the first from\nconsciousness.\nOnce the sleeping state overcome, the censorship resumes complete sway,\nand is now able to revoke that which was granted in a moment of\nweakness. That the _forgetting_ of dreams explains this in part, at\nleast, we are convinced by our experience, confirmed again and again.\nDuring the relation of a dream, or during analysis of one, it not\ninfrequently happens that some fragment of the dream is suddenly\nforgotten. This fragment so forgotten invariably contains the best and\nreadiest approach to an understanding of the dream. Probably that is why\nit sinks into oblivion--_i.e._, into a renewed suppression.\nViewing the dream content as the representation of a realized desire,\nand referring its vagueness to the changes made by the censor in the\nrepressed matter, it is no longer difficult to grasp the function of\ndreams. In fundamental contrast with those saws which assume that sleep\nis disturbed by dreams, we hold the _dream as the guardian of sleep_. So\nfar as children's dreams are concerned, our view should find ready\nacceptance.\nThe sleeping state or the psychical change to sleep, whatsoever it be,\nis brought about by the child being sent to sleep or compelled thereto\nby fatigue, only assisted by the removal of all stimuli which might open\nother objects to the psychical apparatus. The means which serve to keep\nexternal stimuli distant are known; but what are the means we can employ\nto depress the internal psychical stimuli which frustrate sleep? Look at\na mother getting her child to sleep. The child is full of beseeching; he\nwants another kiss; he wants to play yet awhile. His requirements are in\npart met, in part drastically put off till the following day. Clearly\nthese desires and needs, which agitate him, are hindrances to sleep.\nEvery one knows the charming story of the bad boy (Baldwin Groller's)\nwho awoke at night bellowing out, \"_I want the rhinoceros_.\" A really\ngood boy, instead of bellowing, would have _dreamt_ that he was playing\nwith the rhinoceros. Because the dream which realizes his desire is\nbelieved during sleep, it removes the desire and makes sleep possible.\nIt cannot be denied that this belief accords with the dream image,\nbecause it is arrayed in the psychical appearance of probability; the\nchild is without the capacity which it will acquire later to distinguish\nhallucinations or phantasies from reality.\nThe adult has learnt this differentiation; he has also learnt the\nfutility of desire, and by continuous practice manages to postpone his\naspirations, until they can be granted in some roundabout method by a\nchange in the external world. For this reason it is rare for him to have\nhis wishes realized during sleep in the short psychical way. It is even\npossible that this never happens, and that everything which appears to\nus like a child's dream demands a much more elaborate explanation. Thus\nit is that for adults--for every sane person without exception--a\ndifferentiation of the psychical matter has been fashioned which the\nchild knew not. A psychical procedure has been reached which, informed\nby the experience of life, exercises with jealous power a dominating and\nrestraining influence upon psychical emotions; by its relation to\nconsciousness, and by its spontaneous mobility, it is endowed with the\ngreatest means of psychical power. A portion of the infantile emotions\nhas been withheld from this procedure as useless to life, and all the\nthoughts which flow from these are found in the state of repression.\nWhilst the procedure in which we recognize our normal ego reposes upon\nthe desire for sleep, it appears compelled by the psycho-physiological\nconditions of sleep to abandon some of the energy with which it was wont\nduring the day to keep down what was repressed. This neglect is really\nharmless; however much the emotions of the child's spirit may be\nstirred, they find the approach to consciousness rendered difficult, and\nthat to movement blocked in consequence of the state of sleep. The\ndanger of their disturbing sleep must, however, be avoided. Moreover, we\nmust admit that even in deep sleep some amount of free attention is\nexerted as a protection against sense-stimuli which might, perchance,\nmake an awakening seem wiser than the continuance of sleep. Otherwise we\ncould not explain the fact of our being always awakened by stimuli of\ncertain quality. As the old physiologist Burdach pointed out, the mother\nis awakened by the whimpering of her child, the miller by the cessation\nof his mill, most people by gently calling out their names. This\nattention, thus on the alert, makes use of the internal stimuli arising\nfrom repressed desires, and fuses them into the dream, which as a\ncompromise satisfies both procedures at the same time. The dream creates\na form of psychical release for the wish which is either suppressed or\nformed by the aid of repression, inasmuch as it presents it as realized.\nThe other procedure is also satisfied, since the continuance of the\nsleep is assured. Our ego here gladly behaves like a child; it makes the\ndream pictures believable, saying, as it were, \"Quite right, but let me\nsleep.\" The contempt which, once awakened, we bear the dream, and which\nrests upon the absurdity and apparent illogicality of the dream, is\nprobably nothing but the reasoning of our sleeping ego on the feelings\nabout what was repressed; with greater right it should rest upon the\nincompetency of this disturber of our sleep. In sleep we are now and\nthen aware of this contempt; the dream content transcends the censorship\nrather too much, we think, \"It's only a dream,\" and sleep on.\nIt is no objection to this view if there are borderlines for the dream\nwhere its function, to preserve sleep from interruption, can no longer\nbe maintained--as in the dreams of impending dread. It is here changed\nfor another function--to suspend the sleep at the proper time. It acts\nlike a conscientious night-watchman, who first does his duty by quelling\ndisturbances so as not to waken the citizen, but equally does his duty\nquite properly when he awakens the street should the causes of the\ntrouble seem to him serious and himself unable to cope with them alone.\nThis function of dreams becomes especially well marked when there arises\nsome incentive for the sense perception. That the senses aroused during\nsleep influence the dream is well known, and can be experimentally\nverified; it is one of the certain but much overestimated results of the\nmedical investigation of dreams. Hitherto there has been an insoluble\nriddle connected with this discovery. The stimulus to the sense by which\nthe investigator affects the sleeper is not properly recognized in the\ndream, but is intermingled with a number of indefinite interpretations,\nwhose determination appears left to psychical free-will. There is, of\ncourse, no such psychical free-will. To an external sense-stimulus the\nsleeper can react in many ways. Either he awakens or he succeeds in\nsleeping on. In the latter case he can make use of the dream to dismiss\nthe external stimulus, and this, again, in more ways than one. For\ninstance, he can stay the stimulus by dreaming of a scene which is\nabsolutely intolerable to him. This was the means used by one who was\ntroubled by a painful perineal abscess. He dreamt that he was on\nhorseback, and made use of the poultice, which was intended to\nalleviate his pain, as a saddle, and thus got away from the cause of the\ntrouble. Or, as is more frequently the case, the external stimulus\nundergoes a new rendering, which leads him to connect it with a\nrepressed desire seeking its realization, and robs him of its reality,\nand is treated as if it were a part of the psychical matter. Thus, some\none dreamt that he had written a comedy which embodied a definite\n_motif_; it was being performed; the first act was over amid\nenthusiastic applause; there was great clapping. At this moment the\ndreamer must have succeeded in prolonging his sleep despite the\ndisturbance, for when he woke he no longer heard the noise; he concluded\nrightly that some one must have been beating a carpet or bed. The dreams\nwhich come with a loud noise just before waking have all attempted to\ncover the stimulus to waking by some other explanation, and thus to\nprolong the sleep for a little while.\nWhosoever has firmly accepted this _censorship_ as the chief motive for\nthe distortion of dreams will not be surprised to learn as the result of\ndream interpretation that most of the dreams of adults are traced by\nanalysis to erotic desires. This assertion is not drawn from dreams\nobviously of a sexual nature, which are known to all dreamers from their\nown experience, and are the only ones usually described as \"sexual\ndreams.\" These dreams are ever sufficiently mysterious by reason of the\nchoice of persons who are made the objects of sex, the removal of all\nthe barriers which cry halt to the dreamer's sexual needs in his waking\nstate, the many strange reminders as to details of what are called\nperversions. But analysis discovers that, in many other dreams in whose\nmanifest content nothing erotic can be found, the work of interpretation\nshows them up as, in reality, realization of sexual desires; whilst, on\nthe other hand, that much of the thought-making when awake, the thoughts\nsaved us as surplus from the day only, reaches presentation in dreams\nwith the help of repressed erotic desires.\nTowards the explanation of this statement, which is no theoretical\npostulate, it must be remembered that no other class of instincts has\nrequired so vast a suppression at the behest of civilization as the\nsexual, whilst their mastery by the highest psychical processes are in\nmost persons soonest of all relinquished. Since we have learnt to\nunderstand _infantile sexuality_, often so vague in its expression, so\ninvariably overlooked and misunderstood, we are justified in saying that\nnearly every civilized person has retained at some point or other the\ninfantile type of sex life; thus we understand that repressed infantile\nsex desires furnish the most frequent and most powerful impulses for the\nformation of dreams.[1]\nIf the dream, which is the expression of some erotic desire, succeeds in\nmaking its manifest content appear innocently asexual, it is only\npossible in one way. The matter of these sexual presentations cannot be\nexhibited as such, but must be replaced by allusions, suggestions, and\nsimilar indirect means; differing from other cases of indirect\npresentation, those used in dreams must be deprived of direct\nunderstanding. The means of presentation which answer these requirements\nare commonly termed \"symbols.\" A special interest has been directed\ntowards these, since it has been observed that the dreamers of the same\nlanguage use the like symbols--indeed, that in certain cases community\nof symbol is greater than community of speech. Since the dreamers do not\nthemselves know the meaning of the symbols they use, it remains a puzzle\nwhence arises their relationship with what they replace and denote. The\nfact itself is undoubted, and becomes of importance for the technique of\nthe interpretation of dreams, since by the aid of a knowledge of this\nsymbolism it is possible to understand the meaning of the elements of a\ndream, or parts of a dream, occasionally even the whole dream itself,\nwithout having to question the dreamer as to his own ideas. We thus come\nnear to the popular idea of an interpretation of dreams, and, on the\nother hand, possess again the technique of the ancients, among whom the\ninterpretation of dreams was identical with their explanation through\nsymbolism.\nThough the study of dream symbolism is far removed from finality, we now\npossess a series of general statements and of particular observations\nwhich are quite certain. There are symbols which practically always have\nthe same meaning: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) always mean the\nparents; room, a woman[2], and so on. The sexes are represented by a\ngreat variety of symbols, many of which would be at first quite\nincomprehensible had not the clews to the meaning been often obtained\nthrough other channels.\nThere are symbols of universal circulation, found in all dreamers, of\none range of speech and culture; there are others of the narrowest\nindividual significance which an individual has built up out of his own\nmaterial. In the first class those can be differentiated whose claim can\nbe at once recognized by the replacement of sexual things in common\nspeech (those, for instance, arising from agriculture, as reproduction,\nseed) from others whose sexual references appear to reach back to the\nearliest times and to the obscurest depths of our image-building. The\npower of building symbols in both these special forms of symbols has not\ndied out. Recently discovered things, like the airship, are at once\nbrought into universal use as sex symbols.\nIt would be quite an error to suppose that a profounder knowledge of\ndream symbolism (the \"Language of Dreams\") would make us independent of\nquestioning the dreamer regarding his impressions about the dream, and\nwould give us back the whole technique of ancient dream interpreters.\nApart from individual symbols and the variations in the use of what is\ngeneral, one never knows whether an element in the dream is to be\nunderstood symbolically or in its proper meaning; the whole content of\nthe dream is certainly not to be interpreted symbolically. The knowledge\nof dream symbols will only help us in understanding portions of the\ndream content, and does not render the use of the technical rules\npreviously given at all superfluous. But it must be of the greatest\nservice in interpreting a dream just when the impressions of the dreamer\nare withheld or are insufficient.\nDream symbolism proves also indispensable for understanding the\nso-called \"typical\" dreams and the dreams that \"repeat themselves.\"\nDream symbolism leads us far beyond the dream; it does not belong only\nto dreams, but is likewise dominant in legend, myth, and saga, in wit\nand in folklore. It compels us to pursue the inner meaning of the dream\nin these productions. But we must acknowledge that symbolism is not a\nresult of the dream work, but is a peculiarity probably of our\nunconscious thinking, which furnishes to the dream work the matter for\ncondensation, displacement, and dramatization.\n[1] Freud, \"Three Contributions to Sexual Theory,\" translated by A.A.\nBrill (_Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease_ Publishing Company, New\nYork).\n[2] The words from \"and\" to \"channels\" in the next sentence is a short\nsummary of the passage in the original. As this book will be read by\nother than professional people the passage has not been translated, in\ndeference to English opinion.--TRANSLATOR.\nIV\nDREAM ANALYSIS\nPerhaps we shall now begin to suspect that dream interpretation is\ncapable of giving us hints about the structure of our psychic apparatus\nwhich we have thus far expected in vain from philosophy. We shall not,\nhowever, follow this track, but return to our original problem as soon\nas we have cleared up the subject of dream-disfigurement. The question\nhas arisen how dreams with disagreeable content can be analyzed as the\nfulfillment of wishes. We see now that this is possible in case\ndream-disfigurement has taken place, in case the disagreeable content\nserves only as a disguise for what is wished. Keeping in mind our\nassumptions in regard to the two psychic instances, we may now proceed\nto say: disagreeable dreams, as a matter of fact, contain something\nwhich is disagreeable to the second instance, but which at the same time\nfulfills a wish of the first instance. They are wish dreams in the sense\nthat every dream originates in the first instance, while the second\ninstance acts towards the dream only in repelling, not in a creative\nmanner. If we limit ourselves to a consideration of what the second\ninstance contributes to the dream, we can never understand the dream. If\nwe do so, all the riddles which the authors have found in the dream\nremain unsolved.\nThat the dream actually has a secret meaning, which turns out to be the\nfulfillment of a wish, must be proved afresh for every case by means of\nan analysis. I therefore select several dreams which have painful\ncontents and attempt an analysis of them. They are partly dreams of\nhysterical subjects, which require long preliminary statements, and now\nand then also an examination of the psychic processes which occur in\nhysteria. I cannot, however, avoid this added difficulty in the\nexposition.\nWhen I give a psychoneurotic patient analytical treatment, dreams are\nalways, as I have said, the subject of our discussion. It must,\ntherefore, give him all the psychological explanations through whose aid\nI myself have come to an understanding of his symptoms, and here I\nundergo an unsparing criticism, which is perhaps not less keen than that\nI must expect from my colleagues. Contradiction of the thesis that all\ndreams are the fulfillments of wishes is raised by my patients with\nperfect regularity. Here are several examples of the dream material\nwhich is offered me to refute this position.\n\"You always tell me that the dream is a wish fulfilled,\" begins a clever\nlady patient. \"Now I shall tell you a dream in which the content is\nquite the opposite, in which a wish of mine is _not_ fulfilled. How do\nyou reconcile that with your theory? The dream is as follows:--\n_\"I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smoked\nsalmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sunday\nafternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone to\nsome caterers, but the telephone is out of order.... Thus I must resign\nmy wish to give a supper.\"_\nI answer, of course, that only the analysis can decide the meaning of\nthis dream, although I admit that at first sight it seems sensible and\ncoherent, and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfillment. \"But what\noccurrence has given rise to this dream?\" I ask. \"You know that the\nstimulus for a dream always lies among the experiences of the preceding\nday.\"\n_Analysis._--The husband of the patient, an upright and conscientious\nwholesale butcher, had told her the day before that he is growing too\nfat, and that he must, therefore, begin treatment for obesity. He was\ngoing to get up early, take exercise, keep to a strict diet, and above\nall accept no more invitations to suppers. She proceeds laughingly to\nrelate how her husband at an inn table had made the acquaintance of an\nartist, who insisted upon painting his portrait because he, the painter,\nhad never found such an expressive head. But her husband had answered in\nhis rough way, that he was very thankful for the honor, but that he was\nquite convinced that a portion of the backside of a pretty young girl\nwould please the artist better than his whole face[1]. She said that she\nwas at the time very much in love with her husband, and teased him a\ngood deal. She had also asked him not to send her any caviare. What does\nthat mean?\nAs a matter of fact, she had wanted for a long time to eat a caviare\nsandwich every forenoon, but had grudged herself the expense. Of course,\nshe would at once get the caviare from her husband, as soon as she asked\nhim for it. But she had begged him, on the contrary, not to send her the\ncaviare, in order that she might tease him about it longer.\nThis explanation seems far-fetched to me. Unadmitted motives are in the\nhabit of hiding behind such unsatisfactory explanations. We are reminded\nof subjects hypnotized by Bernheim, who carried out a posthypnotic\norder, and who, upon being asked for their motives, instead of\nanswering: \"I do not know why I did that,\" had to invent a reason that\nwas obviously inadequate. Something similar is probably the case with\nthe caviare of my patient. I see that she is compelled to create an\nunfulfilled wish in life. Her dream also shows the reproduction of the\nwish as accomplished. But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?\nThe ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of the\ndream. I beg for more. After a short pause, which corresponds to the\novercoming of a resistance, she reports further that the day before she\nhad made a visit to a friend, of whom she is really jealous, because her\nhusband is always praising this woman so much. Fortunately, this friend\nis very lean and thin, and her husband likes well-rounded figures. Now\nof what did this lean friend speak? Naturally of her wish to become\nsomewhat stouter. She also asked my patient: \"When are you going to\ninvite us again? You always have such a good table.\"\nNow the meaning of the dream is clear. I may say to the patient: \"It is\njust as though you had thought at the time of the request: 'Of course,\nI'll invite you, so you can eat yourself fat at my house and become\nstill more pleasing to my husband. I would rather give no more suppers.'\nThe dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, thereby\nfulfilling your wish not to contribute anything to the rounding out of\nyour friend's figure. The resolution of your husband to refuse\ninvitations to supper for the sake of getting thin teaches you that one\ngrows fat on the things served in company.\" Now only some conversation\nis necessary to confirm the solution. The smoked salmon in the dream has\nnot yet been traced. \"How did the salmon mentioned in the dream occur to\nyou?\" \"Smoked salmon is the favorite dish of this friend,\" she answered.\nI happen to know the lady, and may corroborate this by saying that she\ngrudges herself the salmon just as much as my patient grudges herself\nthe caviare.\nThe dream admits of still another and more exact interpretation, which\nis necessitated only by a subordinate circumstance. The two\ninterpretations do not contradict one another, but rather cover each\nother and furnish a neat example of the usual ambiguity of dreams as\nwell as of all other psychopathological formations. We have seen that at\nthe same time that she dreams of the denial of the wish, the patient is\nin reality occupied in securing an unfulfilled wish (the caviare\nsandwiches). Her friend, too, had expressed a wish, namely, to get\nfatter, and it would not surprise us if our lady had dreamt that the\nwish of the friend was not being fulfilled. For it is her own wish that\na wish of her friend's--for increase in weight--should not be fulfilled.\nInstead of this, however, she dreams that one of her own wishes is not\nfulfilled. The dream becomes capable of a new interpretation, if in the\ndream she does not intend herself, but her friend, if she has put\nherself in the place of her friend, or, as we may say, has identified\nherself with her friend.\nI think she has actually done this, and as a sign of this identification\nshe has created an unfulfilled wish in reality. But what is the meaning\nof this hysterical identification? To clear this up a thorough\nexposition is necessary. Identification is a highly important factor in\nthe mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled\nin their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the\nexperiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it\nwere, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by\nmeans of their own personalities alone. It will here be objected that\nthis is well-known hysterical imitation, the ability of hysteric\nsubjects to copy all the symptoms which impress them when they occur in\nothers, as though their pity were stimulated to the point of\nreproduction. But this only indicates the way in which the psychic\nprocess is discharged in hysterical imitation; the way in which a\npsychic act proceeds and the act itself are two different things. The\nlatter is slightly more complicated than one is apt to imagine the\nimitation of hysterical subjects to be: it corresponds to an unconscious\nconcluded process, as an example will show. The physician who has a\nfemale patient with a particular kind of twitching, lodged in the\ncompany of other patients in the same room of the hospital, is not\nsurprised when some morning he learns that this peculiar hysterical\nattack has found imitations. He simply says to himself: The others have\nseen her and have done likewise: that is psychic infection. Yes, but\npsychic infection proceeds in somewhat the following manner: As a rule,\npatients know more about one another than the physician knows about each\nof them, and they are concerned about each other when the visit of the\ndoctor is over. Some of them have an attack to-day: soon it is known\namong the rest that a letter from home, a return of lovesickness or the\nlike, is the cause of it. Their sympathy is aroused, and the following\nsyllogism, which does not reach consciousness, is completed in them: \"If\nit is possible to have this kind of an attack from such causes, I too\nmay have this kind of an attack, for I have the same reasons.\" If this\nwere a cycle capable of becoming conscious, it would perhaps express\nitself in _fear_ of getting the same attack; but it takes place in\nanother psychic sphere, and, therefore, ends in the realization of the\ndreaded symptom. Identification is therefore not a simple imitation, but\na sympathy based upon the same etiological claim; it expresses an \"as\nthough,\" and refers to some common quality which has remained in the\nunconscious.\nIdentification is most often used in hysteria to express sexual\ncommunity. An hysterical woman identifies herself most readily--although\nnot exclusively--with persons with whom she has had sexual relations, or\nwho have sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself. Language\ntakes such a conception into consideration: two lovers are \"one.\" In the\nhysterical phantasy, as well as in the dream, it is sufficient for the\nidentification if one thinks of sexual relations, whether or not they\nbecome real. The patient, then, only follows the rules of the hysterical\nthought processes when she gives expression to her jealousy of her\nfriend (which, moreover, she herself admits to be unjustified, in that\nshe puts herself in her place and identifies herself with her by\ncreating a symptom--the denied wish). I might further clarify the\nprocess specifically as follows: She puts herself in the place of her\nfriend in the dream, because her friend has taken her own place relation\nto her husband, and because she would like to take her friend's place in\nthe esteem of her husband[2].\nThe contradiction to my theory of dreams in the case of another female\npatient, the most witty among all my dreamers, was solved in a simpler\nmanner, although according to the scheme that the non-fulfillment of one\nwish signifies the fulfillment of another. I had one day explained to\nher that the dream is a wish of fulfillment. The next day she brought me\na dream to the effect that she was traveling with her mother-in-law to\ntheir common summer resort. Now I knew that she had struggled violently\nagainst spending the summer in the neighborhood of her mother-in-law. I\nalso knew that she had luckily avoided her mother-in-law by renting an\nestate in a far-distant country resort. Now the dream reversed this\nwished-for solution; was not this in the flattest contradiction to my\ntheory of wish-fulfillment in the dream? Certainly, it was only\nnecessary to draw the inferences from this dream in order to get at its\ninterpretation. According to this dream, I was in the wrong. _It was\nthus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dream\nshowed her as fulfilled._ But the wish that I should be in the wrong,\nwhich was fulfilled in the theme of the country home, referred to a more\nserious matter. At that time I had made up my mind, from the material\nfurnished by her analysis, that something of significance for her\nillness must have occurred at a certain time in her life. She had denied\nit because it was not present in her memory. We soon came to see that I\nwas in the right. Her wish that I should be in the wrong, which is\ntransformed into the dream, thus corresponded to the justifiable wish\nthat those things, which at the time had only been suspected, had never\noccurred at all.\nWithout an analysis, and merely by means of an assumption, I took the\nliberty of interpreting a little occurrence in the case of a friend, who\nhad been my colleague through the eight classes of the Gymnasium. He\nonce heard a lecture of mine delivered to a small assemblage, on the\nnovel subject of the dream as the fulfillment of a wish. He went home,\ndreamt _that he had lost all his suits_--he was a lawyer--and then\ncomplained to me about it. I took refuge in the evasion: \"One can't win\nall one's suits,\" but I thought to myself: \"If for eight years I sat as\nPrimus on the first bench, while he moved around somewhere in the middle\nof the class, may he not naturally have had a wish from his boyhood days\nthat I, too, might for once completely disgrace myself?\"\nIn the same way another dream of a more gloomy character was offered me\nby a female patient as a contradiction to my theory of the wish-dream.\nThe patient, a young girl, began as follows: \"You remember that my\nsister has now only one boy, Charles: she lost the elder one, Otto,\nwhile I was still at her house. Otto was my favorite; it was I who\nreally brought him up. I like the other little fellow, too, but of\ncourse not nearly as much as the dead one. Now I dreamt last night that\n_I saw Charles lying dead before me. He was lying in his little coffin,\nhis hands folded: there were candles all about, and, in short, it was\njust like the time of little Otto's death, which shocked me so\nprofoundly_. Now tell me, what does this mean? You know me: am I really\nbad enough to wish my sister to lose the only child she has left? Or\ndoes the dream mean that I wish Charles to be dead rather than Otto,\nwhom I like so much better?\"\nI assured her that this interpretation was impossible. After some\nreflection I was able to give her the interpretation of the dream, which\nI subsequently made her confirm.\nHaving become an orphan at an early age, the girl had been brought up in\nthe house of a much older sister, and had met among the friends and\nvisitors who came to the house, a man who made a lasting impression upon\nher heart. It looked for a time as though these barely expressed\nrelations were to end in marriage, but this happy culmination was\nfrustrated by the sister, whose motives have never found a complete\nexplanation. After the break, the man who was loved by our patient\navoided the house: she herself became independent some time after little\nOtto's death, to whom her affection had now turned. But she did not\nsucceed in freeing herself from the inclination for her sister's friend\nin which she had become involved. Her pride commanded her to avoid him;\nbut it was impossible for her to transfer her love to the other suitors\nwho presented themselves in order. Whenever the man whom she loved, who\nwas a member of the literary profession, announced a lecture anywhere,\nshe was sure to be found in the audience; she also seized every other\nopportunity to see him from a distance unobserved by him. I remembered\nthat on the day before she had told me that the Professor was going to a\ncertain concert, and that she was also going there, in order to enjoy\nthe sight of him. This was on the day of the dream; and the concert was\nto take place on the day on which she told me the dream. I could now\neasily see the correct interpretation, and I asked her whether she could\nthink of any event which had happened after the death of little Otto.\nShe answered immediately: \"Certainly; at that time the Professor\nreturned after a long absence, and I saw him once more beside the coffin\nof little Otto.\" It was exactly as I had expected. I interpreted the\ndream in the following manner: \"If now the other boy were to die, the\nsame thing would be repeated. You would spend the day with your sister,\nthe Professor would surely come in order to offer condolence, and you\nwould see him again under the same circumstances as at that time. The\ndream signifies nothing but this wish of yours to see him again, against\nwhich you are fighting inwardly. I know that you are carrying the ticket\nfor to-day's concert in your bag. Your dream is a dream of impatience;\nit has anticipated the meeting which is to take place to-day by several\nhours.\"\nIn order to disguise her wish she had obviously selected a situation in\nwhich wishes of that sort are commonly suppressed--a situation which is\nso filled with sorrow that love is not thought of. And yet, it is very\neasily probable that even in the actual situation at the bier of the\nsecond, more dearly loved boy, which the dream copied faithfully, she\nhad not been able to suppress her feelings of affection for the visitor\nwhom she had missed for so long a time.\nA different explanation was found in the case of a similar dream of\nanother female patient, who was distinguished in her earlier years by\nher quick wit and her cheerful demeanors and who still showed these\nqualities at least in the notion, which occurred to her in the course of\ntreatment. In connection with a longer dream, it seemed to this lady\nthat she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter lying dead before her in a\nbox. She was strongly inclined to convert this dream-image into an\nobjection to the theory of wish-fulfillment, but herself suspected that\nthe detail of the box must lead to a different conception of the\ndream.[3] In the course of the analysis it occurred to her that on the\nevening before, the conversation of the company had turned upon the\nEnglish word \"box,\" and upon the numerous translations of it into\nGerman, such as box, theater box, chest, box on the ear, &c. From other\ncomponents of the same dream it is now possible to add that the lady had\nguessed the relationship between the English word \"box\" and the German\n_B\u00fcchse_, and had then been haunted by the memory that _B\u00fcchse_ (as well\nas \"box\") is used in vulgar speech to designate the female genital\norgan. It was therefore possible, making a certain allowance for her\nnotions on the subject of topographical anatomy, to assume that the\nchild in the box signified a child in the womb of the mother. At this\nstage of the explanation she no longer denied that the picture of the\ndream really corresponded to one of her wishes. Like so many other young\nwomen, she was by no means happy when she became pregnant, and admitted\nto me more than once the wish that her child might die before its birth;\nin a fit of anger following a violent scene with her husband she had\neven struck her abdomen with her fists in order to hit the child within.\nThe dead child was, therefore, really the fulfillment of a wish, but a\nwish which had been put aside for fifteen years, and it is not\nsurprising that the fulfillment of the wish was no longer recognized\nafter so long an interval. For there had been many changes meanwhile.\nThe group of dreams to which the two last mentioned belong, having as\ncontent the death of beloved relatives, will be considered again under\nthe head of \"Typical Dreams.\" I shall there be able to show by new\nexamples that in spite of their undesirable content, all these dreams\nmust be interpreted as wish-fulfillments. For the following dream, which\nagain was told me in order to deter me from a hasty generalization of\nthe theory of wishing in dreams, I am indebted, not to a patient, but to\nan intelligent jurist of my acquaintance. \"_I dream_,\" my informant\ntells me, \"_that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on my\narm. Here a closed wagon is waiting, a gentleman steps up to me, gives\nhis authority as an agent of the police, and demands that I should\nfollow him. I only ask for time in which to arrange my affairs._ Can you\npossibly suppose this is a wish of mine to be arrested?\" \"Of course\nnot,\" I must admit. \"Do you happen to know upon what charge you were\narrested?\" \"Yes; I believe for infanticide.\" \"Infanticide? But you know\nthat only a mother can commit this crime upon her newly born child?\"\n\"That is true.\"[4] \"And under what circumstances did you dream; what\nhappened on the evening before?\" \"I would rather not tell you that; it\nis a delicate matter.\" \"But I must have it, otherwise we must forgo the\ninterpretation of the dream.\" \"Well, then, I will tell you. I spent the\nnight, not at home, but at the house of a lady who means very much to\nme. When we awoke in the morning, something again passed between us.\nThen I went to sleep again, and dreamt what I have told you.\" \"The woman\nis married?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you do not wish her to conceive a child?\" \"No;\nthat might betray us.\" \"Then you do not practice normal coitus?\" \"I take\nthe precaution to withdraw before ejaculation.\" \"Am I permitted to\nassume that you did this trick several times during the night, and that\nin the morning you were not quite sure whether you had succeeded?\" \"That\nmight be the case.\" \"Then your dream is the fulfillment of a wish. By\nmeans of it you secure the assurance that you have not begotten a child,\nor, what amounts to the same thing, that you have killed a child. I can\neasily demonstrate the connecting links. Do you remember, a few days ago\nwe were talking about the distress of matrimony (Ehenot), and about the\ninconsistency of permitting the practice of coitus as long as no\nimpregnation takes place, while every delinquency after the ovum and\nthe semen meet and a foetus is formed is punished as a crime? In\nconnection with this, we also recalled the medi\u00e6val controversy about\nthe moment of time at which the soul is really lodged in the foetus,\nsince the concept of murder becomes admissible only from that point on.\nDoubtless you also know the gruesome poem by Lenau, which puts\ninfanticide and the prevention of children on the same plane.\"\n\"Strangely enough, I had happened to think of Lenau during the\nafternoon.\" \"Another echo of your dream. And now I shall demonstrate to\nyou another subordinate wish-fulfillment in your dream. You walk in\nfront of your house with the lady on your arm. So you take her home,\ninstead of spending the night at her house, as you do in actuality. The\nfact that the wish-fulfillment, which is the essence of the dream,\ndisguises itself in such an unpleasant form, has perhaps more than one\nreason. From my essay on the etiology of anxiety neuroses, you will see\nthat I note interrupted coitus as one of the factors which cause the\ndevelopment of neurotic fear. It would be consistent with this that if\nafter repeated cohabitation of the kind mentioned you should be left in\nan uncomfortable mood, which now becomes an element in the composition\nof your dream. You also make use of this unpleasant state of mind to\nconceal the wish-fulfillment. Furthermore, the mention of infanticide\nhas not yet been explained. Why does this crime, which is peculiar to\nfemales, occur to you?\" \"I shall confess to you that I was involved in\nsuch an affair years ago. Through my fault a girl tried to protect\nherself from the consequences of a _liaison_ with me by securing an\nabortion. I had nothing to do with carrying out the plan, but I was\nnaturally for a long time worried lest the affair might be discovered.\"\n\"I understand; this recollection furnished a second reason why the\nsupposition that you had done your trick badly must have been painful to\nyou.\"\nA young physician, who had heard this dream of my colleague when it was\ntold, must have felt implicated by it, for he hastened to imitate it in\na dream of his own, applying its mode of thinking to another subject.\nThe day before he had handed in a declaration of his income, which was\nperfectly honest, because he had little to declare. He dreamt that an\nacquaintance of his came from a meeting of the tax commission and\ninformed him that all the other declarations of income had passed\nuncontested, but that his own had awakened general suspicion, and that\nhe would be punished with a heavy fine. The dream is a poorly-concealed\nfulfillment of the wish to be known as a physician with a large income.\nIt likewise recalls the story of the young girl who was advised against\naccepting her suitor because he was a man of quick temper who would\nsurely treat her to blows after they were married.\nThe answer of the girl was: \"I wish he _would_ strike me!\" Her wish to\nbe married is so strong that she takes into the bargain the discomfort\nwhich is said to be connected with matrimony, and which is predicted for\nher, and even raises it to a wish.\nIf I group the very frequently occurring dreams of this sort, which seem\nflatly to contradict my theory, in that they contain the denial of a\nwish or some occurrence decidedly unwished for, under the head of\n\"counter wish-dreams,\" I observe that they may all be referred to two\nprinciples, of which one has not yet been mentioned, although it plays a\nlarge part in the dreams of human beings. One of the motives inspiring\nthese dreams is the wish that I should appear in the wrong. These dreams\nregularly occur in the course of my treatment if the patient shows a\nresistance against me, and I can count with a large degree of certainty\nupon causing such a dream after I have once explained to the patient my\ntheory that the dream is a wish-fulfillment.[5] I may even expect this\nto be the case in a dream merely in order to fulfill the wish that I may\nappear in the wrong. The last dream which I shall tell from those\noccurring in the course of treatment again shows this very thing. A\nyoung girl who has struggled hard to continue my treatment, against the\nwill of her relatives and the authorities whom she had consulted, dreams\nas follows: _She is forbidden at home to come to me any more. She then\nreminds me of the promise I made her to treat her for nothing if\nnecessary, and I say to her: \"I can show no consideration in money\nmatters.\"_\nIt is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfillment of a\nwish, but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, the\nsolution of which helps also to solve the first. Where does she get the\nwords which she puts into my mouth? Of course I have never told her\nanything like that, but one of her brothers, the very one who has the\ngreatest influence over her, has been kind enough to make this remark\nabout me. It is then the purpose of the dream that this brother should\nremain in the right; and she does not try to justify this brother merely\nin the dream; it is her purpose in life and the motive for her being\nill.\nThe other motive for counter wish-dreams is so clear that there is\ndanger of overlooking it, as for some time happened in my own case. In\nthe sexual make-up of many people there is a masochistic component,\nwhich has arisen through the conversion of the aggressive, sadistic\ncomponent into its opposite. Such people are called \"ideal\" masochists,\nif they seek pleasure not in the bodily pain which may be inflicted upon\nthem, but in humiliation and in chastisement of the soul. It is obvious\nthat such persons can have counter wish-dreams and disagreeable dreams,\nwhich, however, for them are nothing but wish-fulfillment, affording\nsatisfaction for their masochistic inclinations. Here is such a dream. A\nyoung man, who has in earlier years tormented his elder brother, towards\nwhom he was homosexually inclined, but who had undergone a complete\nchange of character, has the following dream, which consists of three\nparts: (1) _He is \"insulted\" by his brother._ (2) _Two adults are\ncaressing each other with homosexual intentions._ (3) _His brother has\nsold the enterprise whose management the young man reserved for his own\nfuture._ He awakens from the last-mentioned dream with the most\nunpleasant feelings, and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, which might\nbe translated: It would serve me quite right if my brother were to make\nthat sale against my interest, as a punishment for all the torments\nwhich he has suffered at my hands.\nI hope that the above discussion and examples will suffice--until\nfurther objection can be raised--to make it seem credible that even\ndreams with a painful content are to be analyzed as the fulfillments of\nwishes. Nor will it seem a matter of chance that in the course of\ninterpretation one always happens upon subjects of which one does not\nlike to speak or think. The disagreeable sensation which such dreams\narouse is simply identical with the antipathy which endeavors--usually\nwith success--to restrain us from the treatment or discussion of such\nsubjects, and which must be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of its\nunpleasantness, we find it necessary to take the matter in hand. But\nthis disagreeable sensation, which occurs also in dreams, does not\npreclude the existence of a wish; every one has wishes which he would\nnot like to tell to others, which he does not want to admit even to\nhimself. We are, on other grounds, justified in connecting the\ndisagreeable character of all these dreams with the fact of dream\ndisfigurement, and in concluding that these dreams are distorted, and\nthat the wish-fulfillment in them is disguised until recognition is\nimpossible for no other reason than that a repugnance, a will to\nsuppress, exists in relation to the subject-matter of the dream or in\nrelation to the wish which the dream creates. Dream disfigurement,\nthen, turns out in reality to be an act of the censor. We shall take\ninto consideration everything which the analysis of disagreeable dreams\nhas brought to light if we reword our formula as follows: _The dream is\nthe (disguised) fulfillment of a (suppressed, repressed) wish_.\nNow there still remain as a particular species of dreams with painful\ncontent, dreams of anxiety, the inclusion of which under dreams of\nwishing will find least acceptance with the uninitiated. But I can\nsettle the problem of anxiety dreams in very short order; for what they\nmay reveal is not a new aspect of the dream problem; it is a question in\ntheir case of understanding neurotic anxiety in general. The fear which\nwe experience in the dream is only seemingly explained by the dream\ncontent. If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we become\naware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content than\nthe fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobia\ndepends. For example, it is true that it is possible to fall out of a\nwindow, and that some care must be exercised when one is near a window,\nbut it is inexplicable why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is so\ngreat, and why it follows its victims to an extent so much greater than\nis warranted by its origin. The same explanation, then, which applies to\nthe phobia applies also to the dream of anxiety. In both cases the\nanxiety is only superficially attached to the idea which accompanies it\nand comes from another source.\nOn account of the intimate relation of dream fear to neurotic fear,\ndiscussion of the former obliges me to refer to the latter. In a little\nessay on \"The Anxiety Neurosis,\"[6] I maintained that neurotic fear has\nits origin in the sexual life, and corresponds to a libido which has\nbeen turned away from its object and has not succeeded in being applied.\nFrom this formula, which has since proved its validity more and more\nclearly, we may deduce the conclusion that the content of anxiety dreams\nis of a sexual nature, the libido belonging to which content has been\ntransformed into fear.\n[1] To sit for the painter. Goethe: \"And if he has no backside, how can\nthe nobleman sit?\"\n[2] I myself regret the introduction of such passages from the\npsychopathology of hysteria, which, because of their fragmentary\nrepresentation and of being torn from all connection with the subject,\ncannot have a very enlightening influence. If these passages are capable\nof throwing light upon the intimate relations between the dream and the\npsychoneuroses, they have served the purpose for which I have taken them\nup.\n[3] Something like the smoked salmon in the dream of the deferred\nsupper.\n[4] It often happens that a dream is told incompletely, and that a\nrecollection of the omitted portions appear only in the course of the\nanalysis. These portions subsequently fitted in, regularly furnish the\nkey to the interpretation. _Cf._ below, about forgetting in dreams.\n[5] Similar \"counter wish-dreams\" have been repeatedly reported to me\nwithin the last few years by my pupils who thus reacted to their first\nencounter with the \"wish theory of the dream.\"\n[6] See _Selected Papers on Hysteria and other Psychoneuroses_, p. 133,\ntranslated by A.A. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_,\nMonograph Series.\nV\nSEX IN DREAMS\nThe more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, the more willing\none must become to acknowledge that the majority of the dreams of adults\ntreat of sexual material and give expression to erotic wishes. Only one\nwho really analyzes dreams, that is to say, who pushes forward from\ntheir manifest content to the latent dream thoughts, can form an opinion\non this subject--never the person who is satisfied with registering the\nmanifest content (as, for example, N\u00e4cke in his works on sexual dreams).\nLet us recognize at once that this fact is not to be wondered at, but\nthat it is in complete harmony with the fundamental assumptions of dream\nexplanation. No other impulse has had to undergo so much suppression\nfrom the time of childhood as the sex impulse in its numerous\ncomponents, from no other impulse have survived so many and such intense\nunconscious wishes, which now act in the sleeping state in such a manner\nas to produce dreams. In dream interpretation, this significance of\nsexual complexes must never be forgotten, nor must they, of course, be\nexaggerated to the point of being considered exclusive.\nOf many dreams it can be ascertained by a careful interpretation that\nthey are even to be taken bisexually, inasmuch as they result in an\nirrefutable secondary interpretation in which they realize homosexual\nfeelings--that is, feelings that are common to the normal sexual\nactivity of the dreaming person. But that all dreams are to be\ninterpreted bisexually, seems to me to be a generalization as\nindemonstrable as it is improbable, which I should not like to support.\nAbove all I should not know how to dispose of the apparent fact that\nthere are many dreams satisfying other than--in the widest sense--erotic\nneeds, as dreams of hunger, thirst, convenience, &c. Likewise the\nsimilar assertions \"that behind every dream one finds the death\nsentence\" (Stekel), and that every dream shows \"a continuation from the\nfeminine to the masculine line\" (Adler), seem to me to proceed far\nbeyond what is admissible in the interpretation of dreams.\nWe have already asserted elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuously\ninnocent invariably embody coarse erotic wishes, and we might confirm\nthis by means of numerous fresh examples. But many dreams which appear\nindifferent, and which would never be suspected of any particular\nsignificance, can be traced back, after analysis, to unmistakably sexual\nwish-feelings, which are often of an unexpected nature. For example,\nwho would suspect a sexual wish in the following dream until the\ninterpretation had been worked out? The dreamer relates: _Between two\nstately palaces stands a little house, receding somewhat, whose doors\nare closed. My wife leads me a little way along the street up to the\nlittle house, and pushes in the door, and then I slip quickly and easily\ninto the interior of a courtyard that slants obliquely upwards._\nAny one who has had experience in the translating of dreams will, of\ncourse, immediately perceive that penetrating into narrow spaces, and\nopening locked doors, belong to the commonest sexual symbolism, and will\neasily find in this dream a representation of attempted coition from\nbehind (between the two stately buttocks of the female body). The narrow\nslanting passage is of course the vagina; the assistance attributed to\nthe wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality it\nis only consideration for the wife which is responsible for the\ndetention from such an attempt. Moreover, inquiry shows that on the\nprevious day a young girl had entered the household of the dreamer who\nhad pleased him, and who had given him the impression that she would not\nbe altogether opposed to an approach of this sort. The little house\nbetween the two palaces is taken from a reminiscence of the Hradschin\nin Prague, and thus points again to the girl who is a native of that\ncity.\nIf with my patients I emphasize the frequency of the Oedipus dream--of\nhaving sexual intercourse with one's mother--I get the answer: \"I cannot\nremember such a dream.\" Immediately afterwards, however, there arises\nthe recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream, which has\nbeen dreamed repeatedly by the patient, and the analysis shows it to be\na dream of this same content--that is, another Oedipus dream. I can\nassure the reader that veiled dreams of sexual intercourse with the\nmother are a great deal more frequent than open ones to the same effect.\nThere are dreams about landscapes and localities in which emphasis is\nalways laid upon the assurance: \"I have been there before.\" In this case\nthe locality is always the genital organ of the mother; it can indeed be\nasserted with such certainty of no other locality that one \"has been\nthere before.\"\nA large number of dreams, often full of fear, which are concerned with\npassing through narrow spaces or with staying, in the water, are based\nupon fancies about the embryonic life, about the sojourn in the mother's\nwomb, and about the act of birth. The following is the dream of a young\nman who in his fancy has already while in embryo taken advantage of his\nopportunity to spy upon an act of coition between his parents.\n_\"He is in a deep shaft, in which there is a window, as in the Semmering\nTunnel. At first he sees an empty landscape through this window, and\nthen he composes a picture into it, which is immediately at hand and\nwhich fills out the empty space. The picture represents a field which is\nbeing thoroughly harrowed by an implement, and the delightful air, the\naccompanying idea of hard work, and the bluish-black clods of earth make\na pleasant impression. He then goes on and sees a primary school opened\n... and he is surprised that so much attention is devoted in it to the\nsexual feelings of the child, which makes him think of me.\"_\nHere is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, which was turned to\nextraordinary account in the course of treatment.\n_At her summer resort at the ... Lake, she hurls herself into the dark\nwater at a place where the pale moon is reflected in the water._\nDreams of this sort are parturition dreams; their interpretation is\naccomplished by reversing the fact reported in the manifest dream\ncontent; thus, instead of \"throwing one's self into the water,\" read\n\"coming out of the water,\" that is, \"being born.\" The place from which\none is born is recognized if one thinks of the bad sense of the French\n\"la lune.\" The pale moon thus becomes the white \"bottom\" (Popo), which\nthe child soon recognizes as the place from which it came. Now what can\nbe the meaning of the patient's wishing to be born at her summer resort?\nI asked the dreamer this, and she answered without hesitation: \"Hasn't\nthe treatment made me as though I were born again?\" Thus the dream\nbecomes an invitation to continue the cure at this summer resort, that\nis, to visit her there; perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusion\nto the wish to become a mother herself.[1]\nAnother dream of parturition, with its interpretation, I take from the\nwork of E. Jones. _\"She stood at the seashore watching a small boy, who\nseemed to be hers, wading into the water. This he did till the water\ncovered him, and she could only see his head bobbing up and down near\nthe surface. The scene then changed to the crowded hall of a hotel. Her\nhusband left her, and she 'entered into conversation with' a\nstranger.\"_ The second half of the dream was discovered in the analysis\nto represent a flight from her husband, and the entering into intimate\nrelations with a third person, behind whom was plainly indicated Mr.\nX.'s brother mentioned in a former dream. The first part of the dream\nwas a fairly evident birth phantasy. In dreams as in mythology, the\ndelivery of a child _from_ the uterine waters is commonly presented by\ndistortion as the entry of the child _into_ water; among many others,\nthe births of Adonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus are well-known\nillustrations of this. The bobbing up and down of the head in the water\nat once recalled to the patient the sensation of quickening she had\nexperienced in her only pregnancy. Thinking of the boy going into the\nwater induced a reverie in which she saw herself taking him out of the\nwater, carrying him into the nursery, washing him and dressing him, and\ninstalling him in her household.\nThe second half of the dream, therefore, represents thoughts concerning\nthe elopement, which belonged to the first half of the underlying latent\ncontent; the first half of the dream corresponded with the second half\nof the latent content, the birth phantasy. Besides this inversion in\norder, further inversions took place in each half of the dream. In the\nfirst half the child _entered_ the water, and then his head bobbed; in\nthe underlying dream thoughts first the quickening occurred, and then\nthe child left the water (a double inversion). In the second half her\nhusband left her; in the dream thoughts she left her husband.\nAnother parturition dream is related by Abraham of a young woman looking\nforward to her first confinement. From a place in the floor of the house\na subterranean canal leads directly into the water (parturition path,\namniotic liquor). She lifts up a trap in the floor, and there\nimmediately appears a creature dressed in a brownish fur, which almost\nresembles a seal. This creature changes into the younger brother of the\ndreamer, to whom she has always stood in maternal relationship.\nDreams of \"saving\" are connected with parturition dreams. To save,\nespecially to save from the water, is equivalent to giving birth when\ndreamed by a woman; this sense is, however, modified when the dreamer is\na man.\nRobbers, burglars at night, and ghosts, of which we are afraid before\ngoing to bed, and which occasionally even disturb our sleep, originate\nin one and the same childish reminiscence. They are the nightly visitors\nwho have awakened the child to set it on the chamber so that it may not\nwet the bed, or have lifted the cover in order to see clearly how the\nchild is holding its hands while sleeping. I have been able to induce an\nexact recollection of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some of\nthese anxiety dreams. The robbers were always the father, the ghosts\nmore probably corresponded to feminine persons with white night-gowns.\nWhen one has become familiar with the abundant use of symbolism for the\nrepresentation of sexual material in dreams, one naturally raises the\nquestion whether there are not many of these symbols which appear once\nand for all with a firmly established significance like the signs in\nstenography; and one is tempted to compile a new dream-book according to\nthe cipher method. In this connection it may be remarked that this\nsymbolism does not belong peculiarly to the dream, but rather to\nunconscious thinking, particularly that of the masses, and it is to be\nfound in greater perfection in the folklore, in the myths, legends, and\nmanners of speech, in the proverbial sayings, and in the current\nwitticisms of a nation than in its dreams.\nThe dream takes advantage of this symbolism in order to give a disguised\nrepresentation to its latent thoughts. Among the symbols which are used\nin this manner there are of course many which regularly, or almost\nregularly, mean the same thing. Only it is necessary to keep in mind the\ncurious plasticity of psychic material. Now and then a symbol in the\ndream content may have to be interpreted not symbolically, but according\nto its real meaning; at another time the dreamer, owing to a peculiar\nset of recollections, may create for himself the right to use anything\nwhatever as a sexual symbol, though it is not ordinarily used in that\nway. Nor are the most frequently used sexual symbols unambiguous every\ntime.\nAfter these limitations and reservations I may call attention to the\nfollowing: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) in most cases really\nrepresent the parents of the dreamer; the dreamer himself or herself is\nthe prince or princess. All elongated objects, sticks, tree-trunks, and\numbrellas (on account of the stretching-up which might be compared to an\nerection! all elongated and sharp weapons, knives, daggers, and pikes,\nare intended to represent the male member. A frequent, not very\nintelligible, symbol for the same is a nail-file (on account of the\nrubbing and scraping?). Little cases, boxes, caskets, closets, and\nstoves correspond to the female part. The symbolism of lock and key has\nbeen very gracefully employed by Uhland in his song about the \"Grafen\nEberstein,\" to make a common smutty joke. The dream of walking through a\nrow of rooms is a brothel or harem dream. Staircases, ladders, and\nflights of stairs, or climbing on these, either upwards or downwards,\nare symbolic representations of the sexual act. Smooth walls over which\none is climbing, fa\u00e7ades of houses upon which one is letting oneself\ndown, frequently under great anxiety, correspond to the erect human\nbody, and probably repeat in the dream reminiscences of the upward\nclimbing of little children on their parents or foster parents. \"Smooth\"\nwalls are men. Often in a dream of anxiety one is holding on firmly to\nsome projection from a house. Tables, set tables, and boards are women,\nperhaps on account of the opposition which does away with the bodily\ncontours. Since \"bed and board\" (_mensa et thorus_) constitute marriage,\nthe former are often put for the latter in the dream, and as far as\npracticable the sexual presentation complex is transposed to the eating\ncomplex. Of articles of dress the woman's hat may frequently be\ndefinitely interpreted as the male genital. In dreams of men one often\nfinds the cravat as a symbol for the penis; this indeed is not only\nbecause cravats hang down long, and are characteristic of the man, but\nalso because one can select them at pleasure, a freedom which is\nprohibited by nature in the original of the symbol. Persons who make use\nof this symbol in the dream are very extravagant with cravats, and\npossess regular collections of them. All complicated machines and\napparatus in dream are very probably genitals, in the description of\nwhich dream symbolism shows itself to be as tireless as the activity of\nwit. Likewise many landscapes in dreams, especially with bridges or with\nwooded mountains, can be readily recognized as descriptions of the\ngenitals. Finally where one finds incomprehensible neologisms one may\nthink of combinations made up of components having a sexual\nsignificance. Children also in the dream often signify the genitals, as\nmen and women are in the habit of fondly referring to their genital\norgan as their \"little one.\" As a very recent symbol of the male genital\nmay be mentioned the flying machine, utilization of which is justified\nby its relation to flying as well as occasionally by its form. To play\nwith a little child or to beat a little one is often the dream's\nrepresentation of onanism. A number of other symbols, in part not\nsufficiently verified are given by Stekel, who illustrates them with\nexamples. Right and left, according to him, are to be conceived in the\ndream in an ethical sense. \"The right way always signifies the road to\nrighteousness, the left the one to crime. Thus the left may signify\nhomosexuality, incest, and perversion, while the right signifies\nmarriage, relations with a prostitute, &c. The meaning is always\ndetermined by the individual moral view-point of the dreamer.\" Relatives\nin the dream generally play the r\u00f4le of genitals. Not to be able to\ncatch up with a wagon is interpreted by Stekel as regret not to be able\nto come up to a difference in age. Baggage with which one travels is the\nburden of sin by which one is oppressed. Also numbers, which frequently\noccur in the dream, are assigned by Stekel a fixed symbolical meaning,\nbut these interpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor of\ngeneral validity, although the interpretation in individual cases can\ngenerally be recognized as probable. In a recently published book by W.\nStekel, _Die Sprache des Traumes_, which I was unable to utilize, there\nis a list of the most common sexual symbols, the object of which is to\nprove that all sexual symbols can be bisexually used. He states: \"Is\nthere a symbol which (if in any way permitted by the phantasy) may not\nbe used simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense!\" To be\nsure the clause in parentheses takes away much of the absoluteness of\nthis assertion, for this is not at all permitted by the phantasy. I do\nnot, however, think it superfluous to state that in my experience\nStekel's general statement has to give way to the recognition of a\ngreater manifoldness. Besides those symbols, which are just as frequent\nfor the male as for the female genitals, there are others which\npreponderately, or almost exclusively, designate one of the sexes, and\nthere are still others of which only the male or only the female\nsignification is known. To use long, firm objects and weapons as symbols\nof the female genitals, or hollow objects (chests, pouches, &c.), as\nsymbols of the male genitals, is indeed not allowed by the fancy.\nIt is true that the tendency of the dream and the unconscious fancy to\nutilize the sexual symbol bisexually betrays an archaic trend, for in\nchildhood a difference in the genitals is unknown, and the same genitals\nare attributed to both sexes.\nThese very incomplete suggestions may suffice to stimulate others to\nmake a more careful collection.\nI shall now add a few examples of the application of such symbolisms in\ndreams, which will serve to show how impossible it becomes to interpret\na dream without taking into account the symbolism of dreams, and how\nimperatively it obtrudes itself in many cases.\n1. The hat as a symbol of the man (of the male genital): (a fragment\nfrom the dream of a young woman who suffered from agoraphobia on account\nof a fear of temptation).\n\"I am walking in the street in summer, I wear a straw hat of peculiar\nshape, the middle piece of which is bent upwards and the side pieces of\nwhich hang downwards (the description became here obstructed), and in\nsuch a fashion that one is lower than the other. I am cheerful and in a\nconfidential mood, and as I pass a troop of young officers I think to\nmyself: None of you can have any designs upon me.\"\nAs she could produce no associations to the hat, I said to her: \"The hat\nis really a male genital, with its raised middle piece and the two\ndownward hanging side pieces.\" I intentionally refrained from\ninterpreting those details concerning the unequal downward hanging of\nthe two side pieces, although just such individualities in the\ndeterminations lead the way to the interpretation. I continued by saying\nthat if she only had a man with such a virile genital she would not have\nto fear the officers--that is, she would have nothing to wish from them,\nfor she is mainly kept from going without protection and company by her\nfancies of temptation. This last explanation of her fear I had already\nbeen able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other material.\nIt is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after this\ninterpretation. She withdrew her description of the hat, and claimed not\nto have said that the two side pieces were hanging downwards. I was,\nhowever, too sure of what I had heard to allow myself to be misled, and\nI persisted in it. She was quiet for a while, and then found the courage\nto ask why it was that one of her husband's testicles was lower than the\nother, and whether it was the same in all men. With this the peculiar\ndetail of the hat was explained, and the whole interpretation was\naccepted by her. The hat symbol was familiar to me long before the\npatient related this dream. From other but less transparent cases I\nbelieve that the hat may also be taken as a female genital.\n2. The little one as the genital--to be run over as a symbol of sexual\nintercourse (another dream of the same agoraphobic patient).\n\"Her mother sends away her little daughter so that she must go alone.\nShe rides with her mother to the railroad and sees her little one\nwalking directly upon the tracks, so that she cannot avoid being run\nover. She hears the bones crackle. (From this she experiences a feeling\nof discomfort but no real horror.) She then looks out through the car\nwindow to see whether the parts cannot be seen behind. She then\nreproaches her mother for allowing the little one to go out alone.\"\nAnalysis. It is not an easy matter to give here a complete\ninterpretation of the dream. It forms part of a cycle of dreams, and can\nbe fully understood only in connection with the others. For it is not\neasy to get the necessary material sufficiently isolated to prove the\nsymbolism. The patient at first finds that the railroad journey is to be\ninterpreted historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatorium\nfor nervous diseases, with the superintendent of which she naturally was\nin love. Her mother took her away from this place, and the physician\ncame to the railroad station and handed her a bouquet of flowers on\nleaving; she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed this\nhomage. Here the mother, therefore, appears as a disturber of her love\naffairs, which is the r\u00f4le actually played by this strict woman during\nher daughter's girlhood. The next thought referred to the sentence: \"She\nthen looks to see whether the parts can be seen behind.\" In the dream\nfa\u00e7ade one would naturally be compelled to think of the parts of the\nlittle daughter run over and ground up. The thought, however, turns in\nquite a different direction. She recalls that she once saw her father in\nthe bath-room naked from behind; she then begins to talk about the sex\ndifferentiation, and asserts that in the man the genitals can be seen\nfrom behind, but in the woman they cannot. In this connection she now\nherself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital,\nher little one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own genital. She\nreproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had no\ngenital, and recognizes this reproach in the introductory sentence of\nthe dream; the mother sends away her little one so that she must go\nalone. In her phantasy going alone on the street signifies to have no\nman and no sexual relations (coire = to go together), and this she does\nnot like. According to all her statements she really suffered as a girl\non account of the jealousy of her mother, because she showed a\npreference for her father.\nThe \"little one\" has been noted as a symbol for the male or the female\ngenitals by Stekel, who can refer in this connection to a very\nwidespread usage of language.\nThe deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another dream of\nthe same night in which the dreamer identifies herself with her brother.\nShe was a \"tomboy,\" and was always being told that she should have been\nborn a boy. This identification with the brother shows with special\nclearness that \"the little one\" signifies the genital. The mother\nthreatened him (her) with castration, which could only be understood as\na punishment for playing with the parts, and the identification,\ntherefore, shows that she herself had masturbated as a child, though\nthis fact she now retained only in memory concerning her brother. An\nearly knowledge of the male genital which she later lost she must have\nacquired at that time according to the assertions of this second dream.\nMoreover the second dream points to the infantile sexual theory that\ngirls originate from boys through castration. After I had told her of\nthis childish belief, she at once confirmed it with an anecdote in which\nthe boy asks the girl: \"Was it cut off?\" to which the girl replied, \"No,\nit's always been so.\"\nThe sending away of the little one, of the genital, in the first dream\ntherefore also refers to the threatened castration. Finally she blames\nher mother for not having been born a boy.\nThat \"being run over\" symbolizes sexual intercourse would not be evident\nfrom this dream if we were not sure of it from many other sources.\n3. Representation of the genital by structures, stairways, and shafts.\n(Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.)\n\"He is taking a walk with his father in a place which is surely the\nPrater, for the _Rotunda_ may be seen in front of which there is a small\nfront structure to which is attached a captive balloon; the balloon,\nhowever, seems quite collapsed. His father asks him what this is all\nfor; he is surprised at it, but he explains it to his father. They come\ninto a court in which lies a large sheet of tin. His father wants to\npull off a big piece of this, but first looks around to see if any one\nis watching. He tells his father that all he needs to do is to speak to\nthe watchman, and then he can take without any further difficulty as\nmuch as he wants to. From this court a stairway leads down into a shaft,\nthe walls of which are softly upholstered something like a leather\npocketbook. At the end of this shaft there is a longer platform, and\nthen a new shaft begins....\"\nAnalysis. This dream belongs to a type of patient which is not favorable\nfrom a therapeutic point of view. They follow in the analysis without\noffering any resistances whatever up to a certain point, but from that\npoint on they remain almost inaccessible. This dream he almost analyzed\nhimself. \"The Rotunda,\" he said, \"is my genital, the captive balloon in\nfront is my penis, about the weakness of which I have worried.\" We must,\nhowever, interpret in greater detail; the Rotunda is the buttock which\nis regularly associated by the child with the genital, the smaller front\nstructure is the scrotum. In the dream his father asks him what this is\nall for--that is, he asks him about the purpose and arrangement of the\ngenitals. It is quite evident that this state of affairs should be\nturned around, and that he should be the questioner. As such a\nquestioning on the side of the father has never taken place in reality,\nwe must conceive the dream thought as a wish, or take it conditionally,\nas follows: \"If I had only asked my father for sexual enlightenment.\"\nThe continuation of this thought we shall soon find in another place.\nThe court in which the tin sheet is spread out is not to be conceived\nsymbolically in the first instance, but originates from his father's\nplace of business. For discretionary reasons I have inserted the tin for\nanother material in which the father deals, without, however, changing\nanything in the verbal expression of the dream. The dreamer had entered\nhis father's business, and had taken a terrible dislike to the\nquestionable practices upon which profit mainly depends. Hence the\ncontinuation of the above dream thought (\"if I had only asked him\")\nwould be: \"He would have deceived me just as he does his customers.\" For\nthe pulling off, which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, the\ndreamer himself gives a second explanation--namely, onanism. This is not\nonly entirely familiar to us, but agrees very well with the fact that\nthe secrecy of onanism is expressed by its opposite (\"Why one can do it\nquite openly\"). It, moreover, agrees entirely with our expectations that\nthe onanistic activity is again put off on the father, just as was the\nquestioning in the first scene of the dream. The shaft he at once\ninterprets as the vagina by referring to the soft upholstering of the\nwalls. That the act of coition in the vagina is described as a going\ndown instead of in the usual way as a going up, I have also found true\nin other instances[2].\nThe details that at the end of the first shaft there is a longer\nplatform and then a new shaft, he himself explains biographically. He\nhad for some time consorted with women sexually, but had then given it\nup because of inhibitions and now hopes to be able to take it up again\nwith the aid of the treatment. The dream, however, becomes indistinct\ntoward the end, and to the experienced interpreter it becomes evident\nthat in the second scene of the dream the influence of another subject\nhas begun to assert itself; in this his father's business and his\ndishonest practices signify the first vagina represented as a shaft so\nthat one might think of a reference to the mother.\n4. The male genital symbolized by persons and the female by a landscape.\n(Dream of a woman of the lower class, whose husband is a policeman,\nreported by B. Dattner.)\n... Then some one broke into the house and anxiously called for a\npoliceman. But he went with two tramps by mutual consent into a\nchurch,[3] to which led a great many stairs;[4] behind the church there\nwas a mountain,[5] on top of which a dense forest.[6] The policeman was\nfurnished with a helmet, a gorget, and a cloak.[7] The two vagrants, who\nwent along with the policeman quite peaceably, had tied to their loins\nsack-like aprons.[8] A road led from the church to the mountain. This\nroad was overgrown on each side with grass and brushwood, which became\nthicker and thicker as it reached the height of the mountain, where it\nspread out into quite a forest.\n5. A stairway dream.\n(Reported and interpreted by Otto Rank.)\nFor the following transparent pollution dream, I am indebted to the\nsame colleague who furnished us with the dental-irritation dream.\n\"I am running down the stairway in the stair-house after a little girl,\nwhom I wish to punish because she has done something to me. At the\nbottom of the stairs some one held the child for me. (A grown-up woman?)\nI grasp it, but do not know whether I have hit it, for I suddenly find\nmyself in the middle of the stairway where I practice coitus with the\nchild (in the air as it were). It is really no coitus, I only rub my\ngenital on her external genital, and in doing this I see it very\ndistinctly, as distinctly as I see her head which is lying sideways.\nDuring the sexual act I see hanging to the left and above me (also as if\nin the air) two small pictures, landscapes, representing a house on a\ngreen. On the smaller one my surname stood in the place where the\npainter's signature should be; it seemed to be intended for my birthday\npresent. A small sign hung in front of the pictures to the effect that\ncheaper pictures could also be obtained. I then see myself very\nindistinctly lying in bed, just as I had seen myself at the foot of the\nstairs, and I am awakened by a feeling of dampness which came from the\npollution.\"\nInterpretation. The dreamer had been in a book-store on the evening of\nthe day of the dream, where, while he was waiting, he examined some\npictures which were exhibited, which represented motives similar to the\ndream pictures. He stepped nearer to a small picture which particularly\ntook his fancy in order to see the name of the artist, which, however,\nwas quite unknown to him.\nLater in the same evening, in company, he heard about a Bohemian\nservant-girl who boasted that her illegitimate child \"was made on the\nstairs.\" The dreamer inquired about the details of this unusual\noccurrence, and learned that the servant-girl went with her lover to the\nhome of her parents, where there was no opportunity for sexual\nrelations, and that the excited man performed the act on the stairs. In\nwitty allusion to the mischievous expression used about wine-adulterers,\nthe dreamer remarked, \"The child really grew on the cellar steps.\"\nThese experiences of the day, which are quite prominent in the dream\ncontent, were readily reproduced by the dreamer. But he just as readily\nreproduced an old fragment of infantile recollection which was also\nutilized by the dream. The stair-house was the house in which he had\nspent the greatest part of his childhood, and in which he had first\nbecome acquainted with sexual problems. In this house he used, among\nother things, to slide down the banister astride which caused him to\nbecome sexually excited. In the dream he also comes down the stairs very\nrapidly--so rapidly that, according to his own distinct assertions, he\nhardly touched the individual stairs, but rather \"flew\" or \"slid down,\"\nas we used to say. Upon reference to this infantile experience, the\nbeginning of the dream seems to represent the factor of sexual\nexcitement. In the same house and in the adjacent residence the dreamer\nused to play pugnacious games with the neighboring children, in which he\nsatisfied himself just as he did in the dream.\nIf one recalls from Freud's investigation of sexual symbolism[9] that in\nthe dream stairs or climbing stairs almost regularly symbolizes coitus,\nthe dream becomes clear. Its motive power as well as its effect, as is\nshown by the pollution, is of a purely libidinous nature. Sexual\nexcitement became aroused during the sleeping state (in the dream this\nis represented by the rapid running or sliding down the stairs) and the\nsadistic thread in this is, on the basis of the pugnacious playing,\nindicated in the pursuing and overcoming of the child. The libidinous\nexcitement becomes enhanced and urges to sexual action (represented in\nthe dream by the grasping of the child and the conveyance of it to the\nmiddle of the stairway). Up to this point the dream would be one of\npure, sexual symbolism, and obscure for the unpracticed dream\ninterpreter. But this symbolic gratification, which would have insured\nundisturbed sleep, was not sufficient for the powerful libidinous\nexcitement. The excitement leads to an orgasm, and thus the whole\nstairway symbolism is unmasked as a substitute for coitus. Freud lays\nstress on the rhythmical character of both actions as one of the reasons\nfor the sexual utilization of the stairway symbolism, and this dream\nespecially seems to corroborate this, for, according to the express\nassertion of the dreamer, the rhythm of a sexual act was the most\npronounced feature in the whole dream.\nStill another remark concerning the two pictures, which, aside from\ntheir real significance, also have the value of \"Weibsbilder\" (literally\n_woman-pictures_, but idiomatically _women_). This is at once shown by\nthe fact that the dream deals with a big and a little picture, just as\nthe dream content presents a big (grown up) and a little girl. That\ncheap pictures could also be obtained points to the prostitution\ncomplex, just as the dreamer's surname on the little picture and the\nthought that it was intended for his birthday, point to the parent\ncomplex (to be born on the stairway--to be conceived in coitus).\nThe indistinct final scene, in which the dreamer sees himself on the\nstaircase landing lying in bed and feeling wet, seems to go back into\nchildhood even beyond the infantile onanism, and manifestly has its\nprototype in similarly pleasurable scenes of bed-wetting.\n6. A modified stair-dream.\nTo one of my very nervous patients, who was an abstainer, whose fancy\nwas fixed on his mother, and who repeatedly dreamed of climbing stairs\naccompanied by his mother, I once remarked that moderate masturbation\nwould be less harmful to him than enforced abstinence. This influence\nprovoked the following dream:\n\"His piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his piano-playing, and\nfor not practicing the _Etudes_ of Moscheles and Clementi's _Gradus ad\nParnassum_.\" In relation to this he remarked that the _Gradus_ is only a\nstairway, and that the piano itself is only a stairway as it has a\nscale.\nIt is correct to say that there is no series of associations which\ncannot be adapted to the representation of sexual facts. I conclude with\nthe dream of a chemist, a young man, who has been trying to give up his\nhabit of masturbation by replacing it with intercourse with women.\n_Preliminary statement._--On the day before the dream he had given a\nstudent instruction concerning Grignard's reaction, in which magnesium\nis to be dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalytic\ninfluence of iodine. Two days before, there had been an explosion in the\ncourse of the same reaction, in which the investigator had burned his\nhand.\nDream I. _He is to make phenylmagnesium-bromid; he sees the apparatus\nwith particular clearness, but he has substituted himself for the\nmagnesium. He is now in a curious swaying attitude. He keeps repeating\nto himself, \"This is the right thing, it is working, my feet are\nbeginning to dissolve and my knees are getting soft.\" Then he reaches\ndown and feels for his feet, and meanwhile (he does not know how) he\ntakes his legs out of the crucible, and then again he says to himself,\n\"That cannot be.... Yes, it must be so, it has been done correctly.\"\nThen he partially awakens, and repeats the dream to himself, because he\nwants to tell it to me. He is distinctly afraid of the analysis of the\ndream. He is much excited during this semi-sleeping state, and repeats\ncontinually, \"Phenyl, phenyl.\"_\nII. _He is in ... ing with his whole family; at half-past eleven. He is\nto be at the Schottenthor for a rendezvous with a certain lady, but he\ndoes not wake up until half-past eleven. He says to himself, \"It is too\nlate now; when you get there it will be half-past twelve.\" The next\ninstant he sees the whole family gathered about the table--his mother\nand the servant girl with the soup-tureen with particular clearness.\nThen he says to himself, \"Well, if we are eating already, I certainly\ncan't get away.\"_\nAnalysis: He feels sure that even the first dream contains a reference\nto the lady whom he is to meet at the rendezvous (the dream was dreamed\nduring the night before the expected meeting). The student to whom he\ngave the instruction is a particularly unpleasant fellow; he had said to\nthe chemist: \"That isn't right,\" because the magnesium was still\nunaffected, and the latter answered as though he did not care anything\nabout it: \"It certainly isn't right.\" He himself must be this student;\nhe is as indifferent towards his analysis as the student is towards his\nsynthesis; the _He_ in the dream, however, who accomplishes the\noperation, is myself. How unpleasant he must seem to me with his\nindifference towards the success achieved!\nMoreover, he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) is\nmade. For it is a question of the success of the treatment. The legs in\nthe dream recall an impression of the previous evening. He met a lady at\na dancing lesson whom he wished to conquer; he pressed her to him so\nclosely that she once cried out. After he had stopped pressing against\nher legs, he felt her firm responding pressure against his lower thighs\nas far as just above his knees, at the place mentioned in the dream. In\nthis situation, then, the woman is the magnesium in the retort, which is\nat last working. He is feminine towards me, as he is masculine towards\nthe woman. If it will work with the woman, the treatment will also work.\nFeeling and becoming aware of himself in the region of his knees refers\nto masturbation, and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous day....\nThe rendezvous had actually been set for half-past eleven. His wish to\noversleep and to remain with his usual sexual objects (that is, with\nmasturbation) corresponds with his resistance.\n[1] It is only of late that I have learned to value the significance of\nfancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb. They contain\nthe explanation of the curious fear felt by so many people of being\nburied alive, as well as the profoundest unconscious reason for the\nbelief in a life after death which represents nothing but a projection\ninto the future of this mysterious life before birth. _The act of birth,\nmoreover, is the first experience with fear, and is thus the source and\nmodel of the emotion of fear._\n[2] Cf. _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr psychoanalyse_, I.\n[3] Or chapel--vagina.\n[4] Symbol of coitus.\n[5] Mons veneris.\n[6] Crines pubis.\n[7] Demons in cloaks and capucines are, according to the explanation of\na man versed in the subject, of a phallic nature.\n[8] The two halves of the scrotum.\n[9] See _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_, vol. i., p. 2.\nVI\nTHE WISH IN DREAMS\nThat the dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfillment surely seemed\nstrange to us all--and that not alone because of the contradictions\noffered by the anxiety dream.\nAfter learning from the first analytical explanations that the dream\nconceals sense and psychic validity, we could hardly expect so simple a\ndetermination of this sense. According to the correct but concise\ndefinition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation of thinking in\nsleep (in so far as one sleeps). Considering that during the day our\nthoughts produce such a diversity of psychic acts--judgments,\nconclusions, contradictions, expectations, intentions, &c.--why should\nour sleeping thoughts be forced to confine themselves to the production\nof wishes? Are there not, on the contrary, many dreams that present a\ndifferent psychic act in dream form, _e.g._, a solicitude, and is not\nthe very transparent father's dream mentioned above of just such a\nnature? From the gleam of light falling into his eyes while asleep the\nfather draws the solicitous conclusion that a candle has been upset and\nmay have set fire to the corpse; he transforms this conclusion into a\ndream by investing it with a senseful situation enacted in the present\ntense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfillment, and\nwhich are we to suspect--the predominance of the thought continued from,\nthe waking state or of the thought incited by the new sensory\nimpression?\nAll these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply\ninto the part played by the wish-fulfillment in the dream, and into the\nsignificance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.\nIt is in fact the wish-fulfillment that has already induced us to\nseparate dreams into two groups. We have found some dreams that were\nplainly wish-fulfillments; and others in which wish-fulfillment could\nnot be recognized, and was frequently concealed by every available\nmeans. In this latter class of dreams we recognized the influence of the\ndream censor. The undisguised wish dreams were chiefly found in\nchildren, yet fleeting open-hearted wish dreams _seemed_ (I purposely\nemphasize this word) to occur also in adults.\nWe may now ask whence the wish fulfilled in the dream originates. But to\nwhat opposition or to what diversity do we refer this \"whence\"? I think\nit is to the opposition between conscious daily life and a psychic\nactivity remaining unconscious which can only make itself noticeable\nduring the night. I thus find a threefold possibility for the origin of\na wish. Firstly, it may have been incited during the day, and owing to\nexternal circumstances failed to find gratification, there is thus left\nfor the night an acknowledged but unfulfilled wish. Secondly, it may\ncome to the surface during the day but be rejected, leaving an\nunfulfilled but suppressed wish. Or, thirdly, it may have no relation to\ndaily life, and belong to those wishes that originate during the night\nfrom the suppression. If we now follow our scheme of the psychic\napparatus, we can localize a wish of the first order in the system\nForec. We may assume that a wish of the second order has been forced\nback from the Forec. system into the Unc. system, where alone, if\nanywhere, it can maintain itself; while a wish-feeling of the third\norder we consider altogether incapable of leaving the Unc. system. This\nbrings up the question whether wishes arising from these different\nsources possess the same value for the dream, and whether they have the\nsame power to incite a dream.\nOn reviewing the dreams which we have at our disposal for answering this\nquestion, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of the\ndream-wish the actual wish incitements arising during the night, such\nas thirst and sexual desire. It then becomes evident that the source of\nthe dream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream. That a\nwish suppressed during the day asserts itself in the dream can be shown\nby a great many examples. I shall mention a very simple example of this\nclass. A somewhat sarcastic young lady, whose younger friend has become\nengaged to be married, is asked throughout the day by her acquaintances\nwhether she knows and what she thinks of the fianc\u00e9. She answers with\nunqualified praise, thereby silencing her own judgment, as she would\nprefer to tell the truth, namely, that he is an ordinary person. The\nfollowing night she dreams that the same question is put to her, and\nthat she replies with the formula: \"In case of subsequent orders it will\nsuffice to mention the number.\" Finally, we have learned from numerous\nanalyses that the wish in all dreams that have been subject to\ndistortion has been derived from the unconscious, and has been unable to\ncome to perception in the waking state. Thus it would appear that all\nwishes are of the same value and force for the dream formation.\nI am at present unable to prove that the state of affairs is really\ndifferent, but I am strongly inclined to assume a more stringent\ndetermination of the dream-wish. Children's dreams leave no doubt that\nan unfulfilled wish of the day may be the instigator of the dream. But\nwe must not forget that it is, after all, the wish of a child, that it\nis a wish-feeling of infantile strength only. I have a strong doubt\nwhether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream\nin an adult. It would rather seem that as we learn to control our\nimpulses by intellectual activity, we more and more reject as vain the\nformation or retention of such intense wishes as are natural to\nchildhood. In this, indeed, there may be individual variations; some\nretain the infantile type of psychic processes longer than others. The\ndifferences are here the same as those found in the gradual decline of\nthe originally distinct visual imagination.\nIn general, however, I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of the\nday are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I readily admit that\nthe wish instigators originating in conscious like contribute towards\nthe incitement of dreams, but that is probably all. The dream would not\noriginate if the foreconscious wish were not reinforced from another\nsource.\nThat source is the unconscious. I believe that _the conscious wish is a\ndream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish\nwhich reinforces it_. Following the suggestions obtained through the\npsychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious wishes\nare always active and ready for expression whenever they find an\nopportunity to unite themselves with an emotion from conscious life, and\nthat they transfer their greater intensity to the lesser intensity of\nthe latter.[1] It may therefore seem that the conscious wish alone has\nbeen realized in a dream; but a slight peculiarity in the formation of\nthis dream will put us on the track of the powerful helper from the\nunconscious. These ever active and, as it were, immortal wishes from the\nunconscious recall the legendary Titans who from time immemorial have\nborne the ponderous mountains which were once rolled upon them by the\nvictorious gods, and which even now quiver from time to time from the\nconvulsions of their mighty limbs; I say that these wishes found in the\nrepression are of themselves of an infantile origin, as we have learned\nfrom the psychological investigation of the neuroses. I should like,\ntherefore, to withdraw the opinion previously expressed that it is\nunimportant whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another,\nas follows: _The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one_.\nIn the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where no\nseparation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or where\nthese are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled and\nunrepressed wish from the waking state. I am aware that this conception\ncannot be generally demonstrated, but I maintain nevertheless that it\ncan be frequently demonstrated, even when it was not suspected, and that\nit cannot be generally refuted.\nThe wish-feelings which remain from the conscious waking state are,\ntherefore, relegated to the background in the dream formation. In the\ndream content I shall attribute to them only the part attributed to the\nmaterial of actual sensations during sleep. If I now take into account\nthose other psychic instigations remaining from the waking state which\nare not wishes, I shall only adhere to the line mapped out for me by\nthis train of thought. We may succeed in provisionally terminating the\nsum of energy of our waking thoughts by deciding to go to sleep. He is a\ngood sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I. is reputed to have been a\nmodel of this sort. But we do not always succeed in accomplishing it, or\nin accomplishing it perfectly. Unsolved problems, harassing cares,\noverwhelming impressions continue the thinking activity even during\nsleep, maintaining psychic processes in the system which we have termed\nthe foreconscious. These mental processes continuing into sleep may be\ndivided into the following groups: 1, That which has not been terminated\nduring the day owing to casual prevention; 2, that which has been left\nunfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power, _i.e._ the\nunsolved; 3, that which has been rejected and suppressed during the day.\nThis unites with a powerful group (4) formed by that which has been\nexcited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the foreconscious.\nFinally, we may add group (5) consisting of the indifferent and hence\nunsettled impressions of the day.\nWe should not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep by\nthese remnants of waking life, especially those emanating from the group\nof the unsolved. These excitations surely continue to strive for\nexpression during the night, and we may assume with equal certainty that\nthe sleeping state renders impossible the usual continuation of the\nexcitement in the foreconscious and the termination of the excitement by\nits becoming conscious. As far as we can normally become conscious of\nour mental processes, even during the night, in so far we are not\nasleep. I shall not venture to state what change is produced in the\nForec. system by the sleeping state, but there is no doubt that the\npsychological character of sleep is essentially due to the change of\nenergy in this very system, which also dominates the approach to\nmotility, which is paralyzed during sleep. In contradistinction to this,\nthere seems to be nothing in the psychology of the dream to warrant the\nassumption that sleep produces any but secondary changes in the\nconditions of the Unc. system. Hence, for the nocturnal excitation in\nthe Force, there remains no other path than that followed by the wish\nexcitements from the Unc. This excitation must seek reinforcement from\nthe Unc., and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. But\nwhat is the relation of the foreconscious day remnants to the dream?\nThere is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream, that\nthey utilize the dream content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness\neven during the night; indeed, they occasionally even dominate the dream\ncontent, and impel it to continue the work of the day; it is also\ncertain that the day remnants may just as well have any other character\nas that of wishes; but it is highly instructive and even decisive for\nthe theory of wish-fulfillment to see what conditions they must comply\nwith in order to be received into the dream.\nLet us pick out one of the dreams cited above as examples, _e.g._, the\ndream in which my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow's\ndisease. My friend Otto's appearance occasioned me some concern during\nthe day, and this worry, like everything else referring to this person,\naffected me. I may also assume that these feelings followed me into\nsleep. I was probably bent on finding out what was the matter with him.\nIn the night my worry found expression in the dream which I have\nreported, the content of which was not only senseless, but failed to\nshow any wish-fulfillment. But I began to investigate for the source of\nthis incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during the day, and\nanalysis revealed the connection. I identified my friend Otto with a\ncertain Baron L. and myself with a Professor R. There was only one\nexplanation for my being impelled to select just this substitution for\nthe day thought. I must have always been prepared in the Unc. to\nidentify myself with Professor R., as it meant the realization of one of\nthe immortal infantile wishes, viz. that of becoming great. Repulsive\nideas respecting my friend, that would certainly have been repudiated\nin a waking state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into the\ndream, but the worry of the day likewise found some form of expression\nthrough a substitution in the dream content. The day thought, which was\nno wish in itself but rather a worry, had in some way to find a\nconnection with the infantile now unconscious and suppressed wish, which\nthen allowed it, though already properly prepared, to \"originate\" for\nconsciousness. The more dominating this worry, the stronger must be the\nconnection to be established; between the contents of the wish and that\nof the worry there need be no connection, nor was there one in any of\nour examples.\nWe can now sharply define the significance of the unconscious wish for\nthe dream. It may be admitted that there is a whole class of dreams in\nwhich the incitement originates preponderatingly or even exclusively\nfrom the remnants of daily life; and I believe that even my cherished\ndesire to become at some future time a \"professor extraordinarius\" would\nhave allowed me to slumber undisturbed that night had not my worry about\nmy friend's health been still active. But this worry alone would not\nhave produced a dream; the motive power needed by the dream had to be\ncontributed by a wish, and it was the affair of the worriment to\nprocure for itself such wish as a motive power of the dream. To speak\nfiguratively, it is quite possible that a day thought plays the part of\nthe contractor (_entrepreneur_) in the dream. But it is known that no\nmatter what idea the contractor may have in mind, and how desirous he\nmay be of putting it into operation, he can do nothing without capital;\nhe must depend upon a capitalist to defray the necessary expenses, and\nthis capitalist, who supplies the psychic expenditure for the dream is\ninvariably and indisputably _a wish from the unconscious_, no matter\nwhat the nature of the waking thought may be.\nIn other cases the capitalist himself is the contractor for the dream;\nthis, indeed, seems to be the more usual case. An unconscious wish is\nproduced by the day's work, which in turn creates the dream. The dream\nprocesses, moreover, run parallel with all the other possibilities of\nthe economic relationship used here as an illustration. Thus, the\nentrepreneur may contribute some capital himself, or several\nentrepreneurs may seek the aid of the same capitalist, or several\ncapitalists may jointly supply the capital required by the entrepreneur.\nThus there are dreams produced by more than one dream-wish, and many\nsimilar variations which may readily be passed over and are of no\nfurther interest to us. What we have left unfinished in this discussion\nof the dream-wish we shall be able to develop later.\nThe \"tertium comparationis\" in the comparisons just employed--_i.e._ the\nsum placed at our free disposal in proper allotment--admits of still\nfiner application for the illustration of the dream structure. We can\nrecognize in most dreams a center especially supplied with perceptible\nintensity. This is regularly the direct representation of the\nwish-fulfillment; for, if we undo the displacements of the dream-work by\na process of retrogression, we find that the psychic intensity of the\nelements in the dream thoughts is replaced by the perceptible intensity\nof the elements in the dream content. The elements adjoining the\nwish-fulfillment have frequently nothing to do with its sense, but prove\nto be descendants of painful thoughts which oppose the wish. But, owing\nto their frequently artificial connection with the central element, they\nhave acquired sufficient intensity to enable them to come to expression.\nThus, the force of expression of the wish-fulfillment is diffused over a\ncertain sphere of association, within which it raises to expression all\nelements, including those that are in themselves impotent. In dreams\nhaving several strong wishes we can readily separate from one another\nthe spheres of the individual wish-fulfillments; the gaps in the dream\nlikewise can often be explained as boundary zones.\nAlthough the foregoing remarks have considerably limited the\nsignificance of the day remnants for the dream, it will nevertheless be\nworth our while to give them some attention. For they must be a\nnecessary ingredient in the formation of the dream, inasmuch as\nexperience reveals the surprising fact that every dream shows in its\ncontent a connection with some impression of a recent day, often of the\nmost indifferent kind. So far we have failed to see any necessity for\nthis addition to the dream mixture. This necessity appears only when we\nfollow closely the part played by the unconscious wish, and then seek\ninformation in the psychology of the neuroses. We thus learn that the\nunconscious idea, as such, is altogether incapable of entering into the\nforeconscious, and that it can exert an influence there only by uniting\nwith a harmless idea already belonging to the foreconscious, to which it\ntransfers its intensity and under which it allows itself to be\nconcealed. This is the fact of transference which furnishes an\nexplanation for so many surprising occurrences in the psychic life of\nneurotics.\nThe idea from the foreconscious which thus obtains an unmerited\nabundance of intensity may be left unchanged by the transference, or it\nmay have forced upon it a modification from the content of the\ntransferring idea. I trust the reader will pardon my fondness for\ncomparisons from daily life, but I feel tempted to say that the\nrelations existing for the repressed idea are similar to the situations\nexisting in Austria for the American dentist, who is forbidden to\npractise unless he gets permission from a regular physician to use his\nname on the public signboard and thus cover the legal requirements.\nMoreover, just as it is naturally not the busiest physicians who form\nsuch alliances with dental practitioners, so in the psychic life only\nsuch foreconscious or conscious ideas are chosen to cover a repressed\nidea as have not themselves attracted much of the attention which is\noperative in the foreconscious. The unconscious entangles with its\nconnections preferentially either those impressions and ideas of the\nforeconscious which have been left unnoticed as indifferent, or those\nthat have soon been deprived of this attention through rejection. It is\na familiar fact from the association studies confirmed by every\nexperience, that ideas which have formed intimate connections in one\ndirection assume an almost negative attitude to whole groups of new\nconnections. I once tried from this principle to develop a theory for\nhysterical paralysis.\nIf we assume that the same need for the transference of the repressed\nideas which we have learned to know from the analysis of the neuroses\nmakes its influence felt in the dream as well, we can at once explain\ntwo riddles of the dream, viz. that every dream analysis shows an\ninterweaving of a recent impression, and that this recent element is\nfrequently of the most indifferent character. We may add what we have\nalready learned elsewhere, that these recent and indifferent elements\ncome so frequently into the dream content as a substitute for the most\ndeep-lying of the dream thoughts, for the further reason that they have\nleast to fear from the resisting censor. But while this freedom from\ncensorship explains only the preference for trivial elements, the\nconstant presence of recent elements points to the fact that there is a\nneed for transference. Both groups of impressions satisfy the demand of\nthe repression for material still free from associations, the\nindifferent ones because they have offered no inducement for extensive\nassociations, and the recent ones because they have had insufficient\ntime to form such associations.\nWe thus see that the day remnants, among which we may now include the\nindifferent impressions when they participate in the dream formation,\nnot only borrow from the Unc. the motive power at the disposal of the\nrepressed wish, but also offer to the unconscious something\nindispensable, namely, the attachment necessary to the transference. If\nwe here attempted to penetrate more deeply into the psychic processes,\nwe should first have to throw more light on the play of emotions between\nthe foreconscious and the unconscious, to which, indeed, we are urged by\nthe study of the psychoneuroses, whereas the dream itself offers no\nassistance in this respect.\nJust one further remark about the day remnants. There is no doubt that\nthey are the actual disturbers of sleep, and not the dream, which, on\nthe contrary, strives to guard sleep. But we shall return to this point\nlater.\nWe have so far discussed the dream-wish, we have traced it to the sphere\nof the Unc., and analyzed its relations to the day remnants, which in\nturn may be either wishes, psychic emotions of any other kind, or simply\nrecent impressions. We have thus made room for any claims that may be\nmade for the importance of conscious thought activity in dream\nformations in all its variations. Relying upon our thought series, it\nwould not be at all impossible for us to explain even those extreme\ncases in which the dream as a continuer of the day work brings to a\nhappy conclusion and unsolved problem possess an example, the analysis\nof which might reveal the infantile or repressed wish source furnishing\nsuch alliance and successful strengthening of the efforts of the\nforeconscious activity. But we have not come one step nearer a solution\nof the riddle: Why can the unconscious furnish the motive power for the\nwish-fulfillment only during sleep? The answer to this question must\nthrow light on the psychic nature of wishes; and it will be given with\nthe aid of the diagram of the psychic apparatus.\nWe do not doubt that even this apparatus attained its present perfection\nthrough a long course of development. Let us attempt to restore it as it\nexisted in an early phase of its activity. From assumptions, to be\nconfirmed elsewhere, we know that at first the apparatus strove to keep\nas free from excitement as possible, and in its first formation,\ntherefore, the scheme took the form of a reflex apparatus, which enabled\nit promptly to discharge through the motor tracts any sensible stimulus\nreaching it from without. But this simple function was disturbed by the\nwants of life, which likewise furnish the impulse for the further\ndevelopment of the apparatus. The wants of life first manifested\nthemselves to it in the form of the great physical needs. The excitement\naroused by the inner want seeks an outlet in motility, which may be\ndesignated as \"inner changes\" or as an \"expression of the emotions.\" The\nhungry child cries or fidgets helplessly, but its situation remains\nunchanged; for the excitation proceeding from an inner want requires,\nnot a momentary outbreak, but a force working continuously. A change can\noccur only if in some way a feeling of gratification is\nexperienced--which in the case of the child must be through outside\nhelp--in order to remove the inner excitement. An essential constituent\nof this experience is the appearance of a certain perception (of food in\nour example), the memory picture of which thereafter remains associated\nwith the memory trace of the excitation of want.\nThanks to the established connection, there results at the next\nappearance of this want a psychic feeling which revives the memory\npicture of the former perception, and thus recalls the former perception\nitself, _i.e._ it actually re-establishes the situation of the first\ngratification. We call such a feeling a wish; the reappearance of the\nperception constitutes the wish-fulfillment, and the full revival of the\nperception by the want excitement constitutes the shortest road to the\nwish-fulfillment. We may assume a primitive condition of the psychic\napparatus in which this road is really followed, _i.e._ where the\nwishing merges into an hallucination, This first psychic activity\ntherefore aims at an identity of perception, _i.e._ it aims at a\nrepetition of that perception which is connected with the fulfillment of\nthe want.\nThis primitive mental activity must have been modified by bitter\npractical experience into a more expedient secondary activity. The\nestablishment of the identity perception on the short regressive road\nwithin the apparatus does not in another respect carry with it the\nresult which inevitably follows the revival of the same perception from\nwithout. The gratification does not take place, and the want continues.\nIn order to equalize the internal with the external sum of energy, the\nformer must be continually maintained, just as actually happens in the\nhallucinatory psychoses and in the deliriums of hunger which exhaust\ntheir psychic capacity in clinging to the object desired. In order to\nmake more appropriate use of the psychic force, it becomes necessary to\ninhibit the full regression so as to prevent it from extending beyond\nthe image of memory, whence it can select other paths leading ultimately\nto the establishment of the desired identity from the outer world. This\ninhibition and consequent deviation from the excitation becomes the\ntask of a second system which dominates the voluntary motility, _i.e._\nthrough whose activity the expenditure of motility is now devoted to\npreviously recalled purposes. But this entire complicated mental\nactivity which works its way from the memory picture to the\nestablishment of the perception identity from the outer world merely\nrepresents a detour which has been forced upon the wish-fulfillment by\nexperience.[2] Thinking is indeed nothing but the equivalent of the\nhallucinatory wish; and if the dream be called a wish-fulfillment this\nbecomes self-evident, as nothing but a wish can impel our psychic\napparatus to activity. The dream, which in fulfilling its wishes follows\nthe short regressive path, thereby preserves for us only an example of\nthe primary form of the psychic apparatus which has been abandoned as\ninexpedient. What once ruled in the waking state when the psychic life\nwas still young and unfit seems to have been banished into the sleeping\nstate, just as we see again in the nursery the bow and arrow, the\ndiscarded primitive weapons of grown-up humanity. _The dream is a\nfragment of the abandoned psychic life of the child._ In the psychoses\nthese modes of operation of the psychic apparatus, which are normally\nsuppressed in the waking state, reassert themselves, and then betray\ntheir inability to satisfy our wants in the outer world.\nThe unconscious wish-feelings evidently strive to assert themselves\nduring the day also, and the fact of transference and the psychoses\nteach us that they endeavor to penetrate to consciousness and dominate\nmotility by the road leading through the system of the foreconscious. It\nis, therefore, the censor lying between the Unc. and the Forec., the\nassumption of which is forced upon us by the dream, that we have to\nrecognize and honor as the guardian of our psychic health. But is it not\ncarelessness on the part of this guardian to diminish its vigilance\nduring the night and to allow the suppressed emotions of the Unc. to\ncome to expression, thus again making possible the hallucinatory\nregression? I think not, for when the critical guardian goes to\nrest--and we have proof that his slumber is not profound--he takes care\nto close the gate to motility. No matter what feelings from the\notherwise inhibited Unc. may roam about on the scene, they need not be\ninterfered with; they remain harmless because they are unable to put in\nmotion the motor apparatus which alone can exert a modifying influence\nupon the outer world. Sleep guarantees the security of the fortress\nwhich is under guard. Conditions are less harmless when a displacement\nof forces is produced, not through a nocturnal diminution in the\noperation of the critical censor, but through pathological enfeeblement\nof the latter or through pathological reinforcement of the unconscious\nexcitations, and this while the foreconscious is charged with energy and\nthe avenues to motility are open. The guardian is then overpowered, the\nunconscious excitations subdue the Forec.; through it they dominate our\nspeech and actions, or they enforce the hallucinatory regression, thus\ngoverning an apparatus not designed for them by virtue of the attraction\nexerted by the perceptions on the distribution of our psychic energy. We\ncall this condition a psychosis.\nWe are now in the best position to complete our psychological\nconstruction, which has been interrupted by the introduction of the two\nsystems, Unc. and Forec. We have still, however, ample reason for giving\nfurther consideration to the wish as the sole psychic motive power in\nthe dream. We have explained that the reason why the dream is in every\ncase a wish realization is because it is a product of the Unc., which\nknows no other aim in its activity but the fulfillment of wishes, and\nwhich has no other forces at its disposal but wish-feelings. If we\navail ourselves for a moment longer of the right to elaborate from the\ndream interpretation such far-reaching psychological speculations, we\nare in duty bound to demonstrate that we are thereby bringing the dream\ninto a relationship which may also comprise other psychic structures. If\nthere exists a system of the Unc.--or something sufficiently analogous\nto it for the purpose of our discussion--the dream cannot be its sole\nmanifestation; every dream may be a wish-fulfillment, but there must be\nother forms of abnormal wish-fulfillment beside this of dreams. Indeed,\nthe theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms culminates in the proposition\n_that they too must be taken as wish-fulfillments of the unconscious_.\nOur explanation makes the dream only the first member of a group most\nimportant for the psychiatrist, an understanding of which means the\nsolution of the purely psychological part of the psychiatric problem.\nBut other members of this group of wish-fulfillments, _e.g._, the\nhysterical symptoms, evince one essential quality which I have so far\nfailed to find in the dream. Thus, from the investigations frequently\nreferred to in this treatise, I know that the formation of an hysterical\nsymptom necessitates the combination of both streams of our psychic\nlife. The symptom is not merely the expression of a realized\nunconscious wish, but it must be joined by another wish from the\nforeconscious which is fulfilled by the same symptom; so that the\nsymptom is at least doubly determined, once by each one of the\nconflicting systems. Just as in the dream, there is no limit to further\nover-determination. The determination not derived from the Unc. is, as\nfar as I can see, invariably a stream of thought in reaction against the\nunconscious wish, _e.g._, a self-punishment. Hence I may say, in\ngeneral, that _an hysterical symptom originates only where two\ncontrasting wish-fulfillments, having their source in different psychic\nsystems, are able to combine in one expression_. (Compare my latest\nformulation of the origin of the hysterical symptoms in a treatise\npublished by the _Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft_, by Hirschfeld and\nothers, 1908). Examples on this point would prove of little value, as\nnothing but a complete unveiling of the complication in question would\ncarry conviction. I therefore content myself with the mere assertion,\nand will cite an example, not for conviction but for explication. The\nhysterical vomiting of a female patient proved, on the one hand, to be\nthe realization of an unconscious fancy from the time of puberty, that\nshe might be continuously pregnant and have a multitude of children,\nand this was subsequently united with the wish that she might have them\nfrom as many men as possible. Against this immoderate wish there arose a\npowerful defensive impulse. But as the vomiting might spoil the\npatient's figure and beauty, so that she would not find favor in the\neyes of mankind, the symptom was therefore in keeping with her punitive\ntrend of thought, and, being thus admissible from both sides, it was\nallowed to become a reality. This is the same manner of consenting to a\nwish-fulfillment which the queen of the Parthians chose for the triumvir\nCrassus. Believing that he had undertaken the campaign out of greed for\ngold, she caused molten gold to be poured into the throat of the corpse.\n\"Now hast thou what thou hast longed for.\" As yet we know of the dream\nonly that it expresses a wish-fulfillment of the unconscious; and\napparently the dominating foreconscious permits this only after it has\nsubjected the wish to some distortions. We are really in no position to\ndemonstrate regularly a stream of thought antagonistic to the dream-wish\nwhich is realized in the dream as in its counterpart. Only now and then\nhave we found in the dream traces of reaction formations, as, for\ninstance, the tenderness toward friend R. in the \"uncle dream.\" But the\ncontribution from the foreconscious, which is missing here, may be\nfound in another place. While the dominating system has withdrawn on\nthe wish to sleep, the dream may bring to expression with manifold\ndistortions a wish from the Unc., and realize this wish by producing the\nnecessary changes of energy in the psychic apparatus, and may finally\nretain it through the entire duration of sleep.[3]\nThis persistent wish to sleep on the part of the foreconscious in\ngeneral facilitates the formation of the dream. Let us refer to the\ndream of the father who, by the gleam of light from the death chamber,\nwas brought to the conclusion that the body has been set on fire. We\nhave shown that one of the psychic forces decisive in causing the father\nto form this conclusion, instead of being awakened by the gleam of\nlight, was the wish to prolong the life of the child seen in the dream\nby one moment. Other wishes proceeding from the repression probably\nescape us, because we are unable to analyze this dream. But as a second\nmotive power of the dream we may mention the father's desire to sleep,\nfor, like the life of the child, the sleep of the father is prolonged\nfor a moment by the dream. The underlying motive is: \"Let the dream go\non, otherwise I must wake up.\" As in this dream so also in all other\ndreams, the wish to sleep lends its support to the unconscious wish. We\nreported dreams which were apparently dreams of convenience. But,\nproperly speaking, all dreams may claim this designation. The efficacy\nof the wish to continue to sleep is the most easily recognized in the\nwaking dreams, which so transform the objective sensory stimulus as to\nrender it compatible with the continuance of sleep; they interweave this\nstimulus with the dream in order to rob it of any claims it might make\nas a warning to the outer world. But this wish to continue to sleep must\nalso participate in the formation of all other dreams which may disturb\nthe sleeping state from within only. \"Now, then, sleep on; why, it's but\na dream\"; this is in many cases the suggestion of the Forec. to\nconsciousness when the dream goes too far; and this also describes in a\ngeneral way the attitude of our dominating psychic activity toward\ndreaming, though the thought remains tacit. I must draw the conclusion\nthat _throughout our entire sleeping state we are just as certain that\nwe are dreaming as we are certain that we are sleeping_. We are\ncompelled to disregard the objection urged against this conclusion that\nour consciousness is never directed to a knowledge of the former, and\nthat it is directed to a knowledge of the latter only on special\noccasions when the censor is unexpectedly surprised. Against this\nobjection we may say that there are persons who are entirely conscious\nof their sleeping and dreaming, and who are apparently endowed with the\nconscious faculty of guiding their dream life. Such a dreamer, when\ndissatisfied with the course taken by the dream, breaks it off without\nawakening, and begins it anew in order to continue it with a different\nturn, like the popular author who, on request, gives a happier ending to\nhis play. Or, at another time, if placed by the dream in a sexually\nexciting situation, he thinks in his sleep: \"I do not care to continue\nthis dream and exhaust myself by a pollution; I prefer to defer it in\nfavor of a real situation.\"\n[1] They share this character of indestructibility with all psychic acts\nthat are really unconscious--that is, with psychic acts belonging to the\nsystem of the unconscious only. These paths are constantly open and\nnever fall into disuse; they conduct the discharge of the exciting\nprocess as often as it becomes endowed with unconscious excitement To\nspeak metaphorically they suffer the same form of annihilation as the\nshades of the lower region in the _Odyssey_, who awoke to new life the\nmoment they drank blood. The processes depending on the foreconscious\nsystem are destructible in a different way. The psychotherapy of the\nneuroses is based on this difference.\n[2] Le Lorrain justly extols the wish-fulfilment of the dream: \"Sans\nfatigue s\u00e9rieuse, sans \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 cette lutte opin\u00e2tre et\nlongue qui use et corrode les jouissances poursuivies.\"\n[3] This idea has been borrowed from _The Theory of Sleep_ by Li\u00e9bault,\nwho revived hypnotic investigation in our days. (_Du Sommeil provoqu\u00e9_,\netc.; Paris, 1889.)\nVII\nTHE FUNCTION OF THE DREAM\nSince we know that the foreconscious is suspended during the night by\nthe wish to sleep, we can proceed to an intelligent investigation of the\ndream process. But let us first sum up the knowledge of this process\nalready gained. We have shown that the waking activity leaves day\nremnants from which the sum of energy cannot be entirely removed; or the\nwaking activity revives during the day one of the unconscious wishes; or\nboth conditions occur simultaneously; we have already discovered the\nmany variations that may take place. The unconscious wish has already\nmade its way to the day remnants, either during the day or at any rate\nwith the beginning of sleep, and has effected a transference to it. This\nproduces a wish transferred to the recent material, or the suppressed\nrecent wish comes to life again through a reinforcement from the\nunconscious. This wish now endeavors to make its way to consciousness on\nthe normal path of the mental processes through the foreconscious, to\nwhich indeed it belongs through one of its constituent elements. It is\nconfronted, however, by the censor, which is still active, and to the\ninfluence of which it now succumbs. It now takes on the distortion for\nwhich the way has already been paved by its transference to the recent\nmaterial. Thus far it is in the way of becoming something resembling an\nobsession, delusion, or the like, _i.e._ a thought reinforced by a\ntransference and distorted in expression by the censor. But its further\nprogress is now checked through the dormant state of the foreconscious;\nthis system has apparently protected itself against invasion by\ndiminishing its excitements. The dream process, therefore, takes the\nregressive course, which has just been opened by the peculiarity of the\nsleeping state, and thereby follows the attraction exerted on it by the\nmemory groups, which themselves exist in part only as visual energy not\nyet translated into terms of the later systems. On its way to regression\nthe dream takes on the form of dramatization. The subject of compression\nwill be discussed later. The dream process has now terminated the second\npart of its repeatedly impeded course. The first part expended itself\nprogressively from the unconscious scenes or phantasies to the\nforeconscious, while the second part gravitates from the advent of the\ncensor back to the perceptions. But when the dream process becomes a\ncontent of perception it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle set up in\nthe Forec. by the censor and by the sleeping state. It succeeds in\ndrawing attention to itself and in being noticed by consciousness. For\nconsciousness, which means to us a sensory organ for the reception of\npsychic qualities, may receive stimuli from two sources--first, from the\nperiphery of the entire apparatus, viz. from the perception system, and,\nsecondly, from the pleasure and pain stimuli, which constitute the sole\npsychic quality produced in the transformation of energy within the\napparatus. All other processes in the system, even those in the\nforeconscious, are devoid of any psychic quality, and are therefore not\nobjects of consciousness inasmuch as they do not furnish pleasure or\npain for perception. We shall have to assume that those liberations of\npleasure and pain automatically regulate the outlet of the occupation\nprocesses. But in order to make possible more delicate functions, it was\nlater found necessary to render the course of the presentations more\nindependent of the manifestations of pain. To accomplish this the Forec.\nsystem needed some qualities of its own which could attract\nconsciousness, and most probably received them through the connection of\nthe foreconscious processes with the memory system of the signs of\nspeech, which is not devoid of qualities. Through the qualities of this\nsystem, consciousness, which had hitherto been a sensory organ only for\nthe perceptions, now becomes also a sensory organ for a part of our\nmental processes. Thus we have now, as it were, two sensory surfaces,\none directed to perceptions and the other to the foreconscious mental\nprocesses.\nI must assume that the sensory surface of consciousness devoted to the\nForec. is rendered less excitable by sleep than that directed to the\nP-systems. The giving up of interest for the nocturnal mental processes\nis indeed purposeful. Nothing is to disturb the mind; the Forec. wants\nto sleep. But once the dream becomes a perception, it is then capable of\nexciting consciousness through the qualities thus gained. The sensory\nstimulus accomplishes what it was really destined for, namely, it\ndirects a part of the energy at the disposal of the Forec. in the form\nof attention upon the stimulant. We must, therefore, admit that the\ndream invariably awakens us, that is, it puts into activity a part of\nthe dormant force of the Forec. This force imparts to the dream that\ninfluence which we have designated as secondary elaboration for the sake\nof connection and comprehensibility. This means that the dream is\ntreated by it like any other content of perception; it is subjected to\nthe same ideas of expectation, as far at least as the material admits.\nAs far as the direction is concerned in this third part of the dream, it\nmay be said that here again the movement is progressive.\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it will not be amiss to say a few words about\nthe temporal peculiarities of these dream processes. In a very\ninteresting discussion, apparently suggested by Maury's puzzling\nguillotine dream, Goblet tries to demonstrate that the dream requires no\nother time than the transition period between sleeping and awakening.\nThe awakening requires time, as the dream takes place during that\nperiod. One is inclined to believe that the final picture of the dream\nis so strong that it forces the dreamer to awaken; but, as a matter of\nfact, this picture is strong only because the dreamer is already very\nnear awakening when it appears. \"Un r\u00eave c'est un r\u00e9veil qui commence.\"\nIt has already been emphasized by Dugas that Goblet was forced to\nrepudiate many facts in order to generalize his theory. There are,\nmoreover, dreams from which we do not awaken, _e.g._, some dreams in\nwhich we dream that we dream. From our knowledge of the dream-work, we\ncan by no means admit that it extends only over the period of awakening.\nOn the contrary, we must consider it probable that the first part of\nthe dream-work begins during the day when we are still under the\ndomination of the foreconscious. The second phase of the dream-work,\nviz. the modification through the censor, the attraction by the\nunconscious scenes, and the penetration to perception must continue\nthroughout the night. And we are probably always right when we assert\nthat we feel as though we had been dreaming the whole night, although we\ncannot say what. I do not, however, think it necessary to assume that,\nup to the time of becoming conscious, the dream processes really follow\nthe temporal sequence which we have described, viz. that there is first\nthe transferred dream-wish, then the distortion of the censor, and\nconsequently the change of direction to regression, and so on. We were\nforced to form such a succession for the sake of _description_; in\nreality, however, it is much rather a matter of simultaneously trying\nthis path and that, and of emotions fluctuating to and fro, until\nfinally, owing to the most expedient distribution, one particular\ngrouping is secured which remains. From certain personal experiences, I\nam myself inclined to believe that the dream-work often requires more\nthan one day and one night to produce its result; if this be true, the\nextraordinary art manifested in the construction of the dream loses all\nits marvels. In my opinion, even the regard for comprehensibility as an\noccurrence of perception may take effect before the dream attracts\nconsciousness to itself. To be sure, from now on the process is\naccelerated, as the dream is henceforth subjected to the same treatment\nas any other perception. It is like fireworks, which require hours of\npreparation and only a moment for ignition.\nThrough the dream-work the dream process now gains either sufficient\nintensity to attract consciousness to itself and arouse the\nforeconscious, which is quite independent of the time or profundity of\nsleep, or, its intensity being insufficient it must wait until it meets\nthe attention which is set in motion immediately before awakening. Most\ndreams seem to operate with relatively slight psychic intensities, for\nthey wait for the awakening. This, however, explains the fact that we\nregularly perceive something dreamt on being suddenly aroused from a\nsound sleep. Here, as well as in spontaneous awakening, the first glance\nstrikes the perception content created by the dream-work, while the next\nstrikes the one produced from without.\nBut of greater theoretical interest are those dreams which are capable\nof waking us in the midst of sleep. We must bear in mind the expediency\nelsewhere universally demonstrated, and ask ourselves why the dream or\nthe unconscious wish has the power to disturb sleep, _i.e._ the\nfulfillment of the foreconscious wish. This is probably due to certain\nrelations of energy into which we have no insight. If we possessed such\ninsight we should probably find that the freedom given to the dream and\nthe expenditure of a certain amount of detached attention represent for\nthe dream an economy in energy, keeping in view the fact that the\nunconscious must be held in check at night just as during the day. We\nknow from experience that the dream, even if it interrupts sleep,\nrepeatedly during the same night, still remains compatible with sleep.\nWe wake up for an instant, and immediately resume our sleep. It is like\ndriving off a fly during sleep, we awake _ad hoc_, and when we resume\nour sleep we have removed the disturbance. As demonstrated by familiar\nexamples from the sleep of wet nurses, &c., the fulfillment of the wish\nto sleep is quite compatible with the retention of a certain amount of\nattention in a given direction.\nBut we must here take cognizance of an objection that is based on a\nbetter knowledge of the unconscious processes. Although we have\nourselves described the unconscious wishes as always active, we have,\nnevertheless, asserted that they are not sufficiently strong during the\nday to make themselves perceptible. But when we sleep, and the\nunconscious wish has shown its power to form a dream, and with it to\nawaken the foreconscious, why, then, does this power become exhausted\nafter the dream has been taken cognizance of? Would it not seem more\nprobable that the dream should continually renew itself, like the\ntroublesome fly which, when driven away, takes pleasure in returning\nagain and again? What justifies our assertion that the dream removes the\ndisturbance of sleep?\nThat the unconscious wishes always remain active is quite true. They\nrepresent paths which are passable whenever a sum of excitement makes\nuse of them. Moreover, a remarkable peculiarity of the unconscious\nprocesses is the fact that they remain indestructible. Nothing can be\nbrought to an end in the unconscious; nothing can cease or be forgotten.\nThis impression is most strongly gained in the study of the neuroses,\nespecially of hysteria. The unconscious stream of thought which leads to\nthe discharge through an attack becomes passable again as soon as there\nis an accumulation of a sufficient amount of excitement. The\nmortification brought on thirty years ago, after having gained access to\nthe unconscious affective source, operates during all these thirty years\nlike a recent one. Whenever its memory is touched, it is revived and\nshows itself to be supplied with the excitement which is discharged in\na motor attack. It is just here that the office of psychotherapy begins,\nits task being to bring about adjustment and forgetfulness for the\nunconscious processes. Indeed, the fading of memories and the flagging\nof affects, which we are apt to take as self-evident and to explain as a\nprimary influence of time on the psychic memories, are in reality\nsecondary changes brought about by painstaking work. It is the\nforeconscious that accomplishes this work; and the only course to be\npursued by psychotherapy is the subjugate the Unc, to the domination of\nthe Forec.\nThere are, therefore, two exits for the individual unconscious emotional\nprocess. It is either left to itself, in which case it ultimately breaks\nthrough somewhere and secures for once a discharge for its excitation\ninto motility; or it succumbs to the influence of the foreconscious, and\nits excitation becomes confined through this influence instead of being\ndischarged. It is the latter process that occurs in the dream. Owing to\nthe fact that it is directed by the conscious excitement, the energy\nfrom the Forec., which confronts the dream when grown to perception,\nrestricts the unconscious excitement of the dream and renders it\nharmless as a disturbing factor. When the dreamer wakes up for a moment,\nhe has actually chased away the fly that has threatened to disturb his\nsleep. We can now understand that it is really more expedient and\neconomical to give full sway to the unconscious wish, and clear its way\nto regression so that it may form a dream, and then restrict and adjust\nthis dream by means of a small expenditure of foreconscious labor, than\nto curb the unconscious throughout the entire period of sleep. We\nshould, indeed, expect that the dream, even if it was not originally an\nexpedient process, would have acquired some function in the play of\nforces of the psychic life. We now see what this function is. The dream\nhas taken it upon itself to bring the liberated excitement of the Unc.\nback under the domination of the foreconscious; it thus affords relief\nfor the excitement of the Unc. and acts as a safety-valve for the\nlatter, and at the same time it insures the sleep of the foreconscious\nat a slight expenditure of the waking state. Like the other psychic\nformations of its group, the dream offers itself as a compromise serving\nsimultaneously both systems by fulfilling both wishes in so far as they\nare compatible with each other. A glance at Robert's \"elimination\ntheory,\" will show that we must agree with this author in his main\npoint, viz. in the determination of the function of the dream, though we\ndiffer from him in our hypotheses and in our treatment of the dream\nprocess.\nThe above qualification--in so far as the two wishes are compatible with\neach other--contains a suggestion that there may be cases in which the\nfunction of the dream suffers shipwreck. The dream process is in the\nfirst instance admitted as a wish-fulfillment of the unconscious, but if\nthis tentative wish-fulfillment disturbs the foreconscious to such an\nextent that the latter can no longer maintain its rest, the dream then\nbreaks the compromise and fails to perform the second part of its task.\nIt is then at once broken off, and replaced by complete wakefulness.\nHere, too, it is not really the fault of the dream, if, while ordinarily\nthe guardian of sleep, it is here compelled to appear as the disturber\nof sleep, nor should this cause us to entertain any doubts as to its\nefficacy. This is not the only case in the organism in which an\notherwise efficacious arrangement became inefficacious and disturbing as\nsoon as some element is changed in the conditions of its origin; the\ndisturbance then serves at least the new purpose of announcing the\nchange, and calling into play against it the means of adjustment of the\norganism. In this connection, I naturally bear in mind the case of the\nanxiety dream, and in order not to have the appearance of trying to\nexclude this testimony against the theory of wish-fulfillment wherever\nI encounter it, I will attempt an explanation of the anxiety dream, at\nleast offering some suggestions.\nThat a psychic process developing anxiety may still be a\nwish-fulfillment has long ceased to impress us as a contradiction. We\nmay explain this occurrence by the fact that the wish belongs to one\nsystem (the Unc.), while by the other system (the Forec.), this wish has\nbeen rejected and suppressed. The subjection of the Unc. by the Forec.\nis not complete even in perfect psychic health; the amount of this\nsuppression shows the degree of our psychic normality. Neurotic symptoms\nshow that there is a conflict between the two systems; the symptoms are\nthe results of a compromise of this conflict, and they temporarily put\nan end to it. On the one hand, they afford the Unc. an outlet for the\ndischarge of its excitement, and serve it as a sally port, while, on the\nother hand, they give the Forec. the capability of dominating the Unc.\nto some extent. It is highly instructive to consider, _e.g._, the\nsignificance of any hysterical phobia or of an agoraphobia. Suppose a\nneurotic incapable of crossing the street alone, which we would justly\ncall a \"symptom.\" We attempt to remove this symptom by urging him to the\naction which he deems himself incapable of. The result will be an\nattack of anxiety, just as an attack of anxiety in the street has often\nbeen the cause of establishing an agoraphobia. We thus learn that the\nsymptom has been constituted in order to guard against the outbreak of\nthe anxiety. The phobia is thrown before the anxiety like a fortress on\nthe frontier.\nUnless we enter into the part played by the affects in these processes,\nwhich can be done here only imperfectly, we cannot continue our\ndiscussion. Let us therefore advance the proposition that the reason why\nthe suppression of the unconscious becomes absolutely necessary is\nbecause, if the discharge of presentation should be left to itself, it\nwould develop an affect in the Unc. which originally bore the character\nof pleasure, but which, since the appearance of the repression, bears\nthe character of pain. The aim, as well as the result, of the\nsuppression is to stop the development of this pain. The suppression\nextends over the unconscious ideation, because the liberation of pain\nmight emanate from the ideation. The foundation is here laid for a very\ndefinite assumption concerning the nature of the affective development.\nIt is regarded as a motor or secondary activity, the key to the\ninnervation of which is located in the presentations of the Unc. Through\nthe domination of the Forec. these presentations become, as it were,\nthrottled and inhibited at the exit of the emotion-developing impulses.\nThe danger, which is due to the fact that the Forec. ceases to occupy\nthe energy, therefore consists in the fact that the unconscious\nexcitations liberate such an affect as--in consequence of the repression\nthat has previously taken place--can only be perceived as pain or\nanxiety.\nThis danger is released through the full sway of the dream process. The\ndeterminations for its realization consist in the fact that repressions\nhave taken place, and that the suppressed emotional wishes shall become\nsufficiently strong. They thus stand entirely without the psychological\nrealm of the dream structure. Were it not for the fact that our subject\nis connected through just one factor, namely, the freeing of the Unc.\nduring sleep, with the subject of the development of anxiety, I could\ndispense with discussion of the anxiety dream, and thus avoid all\nobscurities connected with it.\nAs I have often repeated, the theory of the anxiety belongs to the\npsychology of the neuroses. I would say that the anxiety in the dream is\nan anxiety problem and not a dream problem. We have nothing further to\ndo with it after having once demonstrated its point of contact with the\nsubject of the dream process. There is only one thing left for me to do.\nAs I have asserted that the neurotic anxiety originates from sexual\nsources, I can subject anxiety dreams to analysis in order to\ndemonstrate the sexual material in their dream thoughts.\nFor good reasons I refrain from citing here any of the numerous examples\nplaced at my disposal by neurotic patients, but prefer to give anxiety\ndreams from young persons.\nPersonally, I have had no real anxiety dream for decades, but I recall\none from my seventh or eighth year which I subjected to interpretation\nabout thirty years later. The dream was very vivid, and showed me _my\nbeloved mother, with peculiarly calm sleeping countenance, carried into\nthe room and laid on the bed by two (or three) persons with birds'\nbeaks_. I awoke crying and screaming, and disturbed my parents. The very\ntall figures--draped in a peculiar manner--with beaks, I had taken from\nthe illustrations of Philippson's bible; I believe they represented\ndeities with heads of sparrowhawks from an Egyptian tomb relief. The\nanalysis also introduced the reminiscence of a naughty janitor's boy,\nwho used to play with us children on the meadow in front of the house; I\nwould add that his name was Philip. I feel that I first heard from this\nboy the vulgar word signifying sexual intercourse, which is replaced\namong the educated by the Latin \"coitus,\" but to which the dream\ndistinctly alludes by the selection of the birds' heads. I must have\nsuspected the sexual significance of the word from the facial expression\nof my worldly-wise teacher. My mother's features in the dream were\ncopied from the countenance of my grandfather, whom I had seen a few\ndays before his death snoring in the state of coma. The interpretation\nof the secondary elaboration in the dream must therefore have been that\nmy mother was dying; the tomb relief, too, agrees with this. In this\nanxiety I awoke, and could not calm myself until I had awakened my\nparents. I remember that I suddenly became calm on coming face to face\nwith my mother, as if I needed the assurance that my mother was not\ndead. But this secondary interpretation of the dream had been effected\nonly under the influence of the developed anxiety. I was not frightened\nbecause I dreamed that my mother was dying, but I interpreted the dream\nin this manner in the foreconscious elaboration because I was already\nunder the domination of the anxiety. The latter, however, could be\ntraced by means of the repression to an obscure obviously sexual desire,\nwhich had found its satisfying expression in the visual content of the\ndream.\nA man twenty-seven years old who had been severely ill for a year had\nhad many terrifying dreams between the ages of eleven and thirteen. He\nthought that a man with an ax was running after him; he wished to run,\nbut felt paralyzed and could not move from the spot. This may be taken\nas a good example of a very common, and apparently sexually indifferent,\nanxiety dream. In the analysis the dreamer first thought of a story told\nhim by his uncle, which chronologically was later than the dream, viz.\nthat he was attacked at night by a suspicious-looking individual. This\noccurrence led him to believe that he himself might have already heard\nof a similar episode at the time of the dream. In connection with the ax\nhe recalled that during that period of his life he once hurt his hand\nwith an ax while chopping wood. This immediately led to his relations\nwith his younger brother, whom he used to maltreat and knock down. In\nparticular, he recalled an occasion when he struck his brother on the\nhead with his boot until he bled, whereupon his mother remarked: \"I fear\nhe will kill him some day.\" While he was seemingly thinking of the\nsubject of violence, a reminiscence from his ninth year suddenly\noccurred to him. His parents came home late and went to bed while he was\nfeigning sleep. He soon heard panting and other noises that appeared\nstrange to him, and he could also make out the position of his parents\nin bed. His further associations showed that he had established an\nanalogy between this relation between his parents and his own relation\ntoward his younger brother. He subsumed what occurred between his\nparents under the conception \"violence and wrestling,\" and thus reached\na sadistic conception of the coitus act, as often happens among\nchildren. The fact that he often noticed blood on his mother's bed\ncorroborated his conception.\nThat the sexual intercourse of adults appears strange to children who\nobserve it, and arouses fear in them, I dare say is a fact of daily\nexperience. I have explained this fear by the fact that sexual\nexcitement is not mastered by their understanding, and is probably also\ninacceptable to them because their parents are involved in it. For the\nsame son this excitement is converted into fear. At a still earlier\nperiod of life sexual emotion directed toward the parent of opposite sex\ndoes not meet with repression but finds free expression, as we have seen\nbefore.\nFor the night terrors with hallucinations (_pavor nocturnus_) frequently\nfound in children, I would unhesitatingly give the same explanation.\nHere, too, we are certainly dealing with the incomprehensible and\nrejected sexual feelings, which, if noted, would probably show a\ntemporal periodicity, for an enhancement of the sexual _libido_ may\njust as well be produced accidentally through emotional impressions as\nthrough the spontaneous and gradual processes of development.\nI lack the necessary material to sustain these explanations from\nobservation. On the other hand, the pediatrists seem to lack the point\nof view which alone makes comprehensible the whole series of phenomena,\non the somatic as well as on the psychic side. To illustrate by a\ncomical example how one wearing the blinders of medical mythology may\nmiss the understanding of such cases I will relate a case which I found\nin a thesis on _pavor nocturnus_ by _Debacker_, 1881. A\nthirteen-year-old boy of delicate health began to become anxious and\ndreamy; his sleep became restless, and about once a week it was\ninterrupted by an acute attack of anxiety with hallucinations. The\nmemory of these dreams was invariably very distinct. Thus, he related\nthat the _devil_ shouted at him: \"Now we have you, now we have you,\" and\nthis was followed by an odor of sulphur; the fire burned his skin. This\ndream aroused him, terror-stricken. He was unable to scream at first;\nthen his voice returned, and he was heard to say distinctly: \"No, no,\nnot me; why, I have done nothing,\" or, \"Please don't, I shall never do\nit again.\" Occasionally, also, he said: \"Albert has not done that.\"\nLater he avoided undressing, because, as he said, the fire attacked him\nonly when he was undressed. From amid these evil dreams, which menaced\nhis health, he was sent into the country, where he recovered within a\nyear and a half, but at the age of fifteen he once confessed: \"Je\nn'osais pas l'avouer, mais j'\u00e9prouvais continuellement des picotements\net des surexcitations aux _parties_; \u00e0 la fin, cela m'\u00e9nervait tant que\nplusieurs fois, j'ai pens\u00e9 me jeter par la fen\u00eatre au dortoir.\"\nIt is certainly not difficult to suspect: 1, that the boy had practiced\nmasturbation in former years, that he probably denied it, and was\nthreatened with severe punishment for his wrongdoing (his confession: Je\nne le ferai plus; his denial: Albert n'a jamais fait \u00e7a). 2, That under\nthe pressure of puberty the temptation to self-abuse through the\ntickling of the genitals was reawakened. 3, That now, however, a\nstruggle of repression arose in him, suppressing the _libido_ and\nchanging it into fear, which subsequently took the form of the\npunishments with which he was then threatened.\nLet us, however, quote the conclusions drawn by our author. This\nobservation shows: 1, That the influence of puberty may produce in a\nboy of delicate health a condition of extreme weakness, and that it may\nlead to a _very marked cerebral an\u00e6mia_.\n2. This cerebral an\u00e6mia produces a transformation of character,\ndemonomaniacal hallucinations, and very violent nocturnal, perhaps also\ndiurnal, states of anxiety.\n3. Demonomania and the self-reproaches of the day can be traced to the\ninfluences of religious education which the subject underwent as a\nchild.\n4. All manifestations disappeared as a result of a lengthy sojourn in\nthe country, bodily exercise, and the return of physical strength after\nthe termination of the period of puberty.\n5. A predisposing influence for the origin of the cerebral condition of\nthe boy may be attributed to heredity and to the father's chronic\nsyphilitic state.\nThe concluding remarks of the author read: \"Nous avons fait entrer cette\nobservation dans le cadre des d\u00e9lires apyr\u00e9tiques d'inanition, car c'est\n\u00e0 l'isch\u00e9mie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale que nous rattachons cet \u00e9tat particulier.\"\nVIII\nTHE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PROCESS--REGRESSION\nIn venturing to attempt to penetrate more deeply into the psychology of\nthe dream processes, I have undertaken a difficult task, to which,\nindeed, my power of description is hardly equal. To reproduce in\ndescription by a succession of words the simultaneousness of so complex\na chain of events, and in doing so to appear unbiassed throughout the\nexposition, goes fairly beyond my powers. I have now to atone for the\nfact that I have been unable in my description of the dream psychology\nto follow the historic development of my views. The view-points for my\nconception of the dream were reached through earlier investigations in\nthe psychology of the neuroses, to which I am not supposed to refer\nhere, but to which I am repeatedly forced to refer, whereas I should\nprefer to proceed in the opposite direction, and, starting from the\ndream, to establish a connection with the psychology of the neuroses. I\nam well aware of all the inconveniences arising for the reader from this\ndifficulty, but I know of no way to avoid them.\nAs I am dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I am glad to dwell\nupon another view-point which seems to raise the value of my efforts. As\nhas been shown in the introduction to the first chapter, I found myself\nconfronted with a theme which had been marked by the sharpest\ncontradictions on the part of the authorities. After our elaboration of\nthe dream problems we found room for most of these contradictions. We\nhave been forced, however, to take decided exception to two of the views\npronounced, viz. that the dream is a senseless and that it is a somatic\nprocess; apart from these cases we have had to accept all the\ncontradictory views in one place or another of the complicated argument,\nand we have been able to demonstrate that they had discovered something\nthat was correct. That the dream continues the impulses and interests of\nthe waking state has been quite generally confirmed through the\ndiscovery of the latent thoughts of the dream. These thoughts concern\nthemselves only with things that seem important and of momentous\ninterest to us. The dream never occupies itself with trifles. But we\nhave also concurred with the contrary view, viz., that the dream gathers\nup the indifferent remnants from the day, and that not until it has in\nsome measure withdrawn itself from the waking activity can an important\nevent of the day be taken up by the dream. We found this holding true\nfor the dream content, which gives the dream thought its changed\nexpression by means of disfigurement. We have said that from the nature\nof the association mechanism the dream process more easily takes\npossession of recent or indifferent material which has not yet been\nseized by the waking mental activity; and by reason of the censor it\ntransfers the psychic intensity from the important but also disagreeable\nto the indifferent material. The hypermnesia of the dream and the resort\nto infantile material have become main supports in our theory. In our\ntheory of the dream we have attributed to the wish originating from the\ninfantile the part of an indispensable motor for the formation of the\ndream. We naturally could not think of doubting the experimentally\ndemonstrated significance of the objective sensory stimuli during sleep;\nbut we have brought this material into the same relation to the\ndream-wish as the thought remnants from the waking activity. There was\nno need of disputing the fact that the dream interprets the objective\nsensory stimuli after the manner of an illusion; but we have supplied\nthe motive for this interpretation which has been left undecided by the\nauthorities. The interpretation follows in such a manner that the\nperceived object is rendered harmless as a sleep disturber and becomes\navailable for the wish-fulfillment. Though we do not admit as special\nsources of the dream the subjective state of excitement of the sensory\norgans during sleep, which seems to have been demonstrated by Trumbull\nLadd, we are nevertheless able to explain this excitement through the\nregressive revival of active memories behind the dream. A modest part in\nour conception has also been assigned to the inner organic sensations\nwhich are wont to be taken as the cardinal point in the explanation of\nthe dream. These--the sensation of falling, flying, or inhibition--stand\nas an ever ready material to be used by the dream-work to express the\ndream thought as often as need arises.\nThat the dream process is a rapid and momentary one seems to be true for\nthe perception through consciousness of the already prepared dream\ncontent; the preceding parts of the dream process probably take a slow,\nfluctuating course. We have solved the riddle of the superabundant dream\ncontent compressed within the briefest moment by explaining that this is\ndue to the appropriation of almost fully formed structures from the\npsychic life. That the dream is disfigured and distorted by memory we\nfound to be correct, but not troublesome, as this is only the last\nmanifest operation in the work of disfigurement which has been active\nfrom the beginning of the dream-work. In the bitter and seemingly\nirreconcilable controversy as to whether the psychic life sleeps at\nnight or can make the same use of all its capabilities as during the\nday, we have been able to agree with both sides, though not fully with\neither. We have found proof that the dream thoughts represent a most\ncomplicated intellectual activity, employing almost every means\nfurnished by the psychic apparatus; still it cannot be denied that these\ndream thoughts have originated during the day, and it is indispensable\nto assume that there is a sleeping state of the psychic life. Thus, even\nthe theory of partial sleep has come into play; but the characteristics\nof the sleeping state have been found not in the dilapidation of the\npsychic connections but in the cessation of the psychic system\ndominating the day, arising from its desire to sleep. The withdrawal\nfrom the outer world retains its significance also for our conception;\nthough not the only factor, it nevertheless helps the regression to make\npossible the representation of the dream. That we should reject the\nvoluntary guidance of the presentation course is uncontestable; but the\npsychic life does not thereby become aimless, for we have seen that\nafter the abandonment of the desired end-presentation undesired ones\ngain the mastery. The loose associative connection in the dream we have\nnot only recognized, but we have placed under its control a far greater\nterritory than could have been supposed; we have, however, found it\nmerely the feigned substitute for another correct and senseful one. To\nbe sure we, too, have called the dream absurd; but we have been able to\nlearn from examples how wise the dream really is when it simulates\nabsurdity. We do not deny any of the functions that have been attributed\nto the dream. That the dream relieves the mind like a valve, and that,\naccording to Robert's assertion, all kinds of harmful material are\nrendered harmless through representation in the dream, not only exactly\ncoincides with our theory of the twofold wish-fulfillment in the dream,\nbut, in his own wording, becomes even more comprehensible for us than\nfor Robert himself. The free indulgence of the psychic in the play of\nits faculties finds expression with us in the non-interference with the\ndream on the part of the foreconscious activity. The \"return to the\nembryonal state of psychic life in the dream\" and the observation of\nHavelock Ellis, \"an archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\nthoughts,\" appear to us as happy anticipations of our deductions to the\neffect that _primitive_ modes of work suppressed during the day\nparticipate in the formation of the dream; and with us, as with Delage,\nthe _suppressed_ material becomes the mainspring of the dreaming.\nWe have fully recognized the r\u00f4le which Scherner ascribes to the dream\nphantasy, and even his interpretation; but we have been obliged, so to\nspeak, to conduct them to another department in the problem. It is not\nthe dream that produces the phantasy but the unconscious phantasy that\ntakes the greatest part in the formation of the dream thoughts. We are\nindebted to Scherner for his clew to the source of the dream thoughts,\nbut almost everything that he ascribes to the dream-work is attributable\nto the activity of the unconscious, which is at work during the day, and\nwhich supplies incitements not only for dreams but for neurotic symptoms\nas well. We have had to separate the dream-work from this activity as\nbeing something entirely different and far more restricted. Finally, we\nhave by no means abandoned the relation of the dream to mental\ndisturbances, but, on the contrary, we have given it a more solid\nfoundation on new ground.\nThus held together by the new material of our theory as by a superior\nunity, we find the most varied and most contradictory conclusions of the\nauthorities fitting into our structure; some of them are differently\ndisposed, only a few of them are entirely rejected. But our own\nstructure is still unfinished. For, disregarding the many obscurities\nwhich we have necessarily encountered in our advance into the darkness\nof psychology, we are now apparently embarrassed by a new contradiction.\nOn the one hand, we have allowed the dream thoughts to proceed from\nperfectly normal mental operations, while, on the other hand, we have\nfound among the dream thoughts a number of entirely abnormal mental\nprocesses which extend likewise to the dream contents. These,\nconsequently, we have repeated in the interpretation of the dream. All\nthat we have termed the \"dream-work\" seems so remote from the psychic\nprocesses recognized by us as correct, that the severest judgments of\nthe authors as to the low psychic activity of dreaming seem to us well\nfounded.\nPerhaps only through still further advance can enlightenment and\nimprovement be brought about. I shall pick out one of the constellations\nleading to the formation of dreams.\nWe have learned that the dream replaces a number of thoughts derived\nfrom daily life which are perfectly formed logically. We cannot\ntherefore doubt that these thoughts originate from our normal mental\nlife. All the qualities which we esteem in our mental operations, and\nwhich distinguish these as complicated activities of a high order, we\nfind repeated in the dream thoughts. There is, however, no need of\nassuming that this mental work is performed during sleep, as this would\nmaterially impair the conception of the psychic state of sleep we have\nhitherto adhered to. These thoughts may just as well have originated\nfrom the day, and, unnoticed by our consciousness from their inception,\nthey may have continued to develop until they stood complete at the\nonset of sleep. If we are to conclude anything from this state of\naffairs, it will at most prove _that the most complex mental operations\nare possible without the co\u00f6peration of consciousness_, which we have\nalready learned independently from every psychoanalysis of persons\nsuffering from hysteria or obsessions. These dream thoughts are in\nthemselves surely not incapable of consciousness; if they have not\nbecome conscious to us during the day, this may have various reasons.\nThe state of becoming conscious depends on the exercise of a certain\npsychic function, viz. attention, which seems to be extended only in a\ndefinite quantity, and which may have been withdrawn from the stream of\nthought in Question by other aims. Another way in which such mental\nstreams are kept from consciousness is the following:--Our conscious\nreflection teaches us that when exercising attention we pursue a\ndefinite course. But if that course leads us to an idea which does not\nhold its own with the critic, we discontinue and cease to apply our\nattention. Now, apparently, the stream of thought thus started and\nabandoned may spin on without regaining attention unless it reaches a\nspot of especially marked intensity which forces the return of\nattention. An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought about by\nthe judgment on the ground of incorrectness or unfitness for the actual\npurpose of the mental act, may therefore account for the fact that a\nmental process continues until the onset of sleep unnoticed by\nconsciousness.\nLet us recapitulate by saying that we call such a stream of thought a\nforeconscious one, that we believe it to be perfectly correct, and that\nit may just as well be a more neglected one or an interrupted and\nsuppressed one. Let us also state frankly in what manner we conceive\nthis presentation course. We believe that a certain sum of excitement,\nwhich we call occupation energy, is displaced from an end-presentation\nalong the association paths selected by that end-presentation. A\n\"neglected\" stream of thought has received no such occupation, and from\na \"suppressed\" or \"rejected\" one this occupation has been withdrawn;\nboth have thus been left to their own emotions. The end-stream of\nthought stocked with energy is under certain conditions able to draw to\nitself the attention of consciousness, through which means it then\nreceives a \"surplus of energy.\" We shall be obliged somewhat later to\nelucidate our assumption concerning the nature and activity of\nconsciousness.\nA train of thought thus incited in the Forec. may either disappear\nspontaneously or continue. The former issue we conceive as follows: It\ndiffuses its energy through all the association paths emanating from it,\nand throws the entire chain of ideas into a state of excitement which,\nafter lasting for a while, subsides through the transformation of the\nexcitement requiring an outlet into dormant energy.[1] If this first\nissue is brought about the process has no further significance for the\ndream formation. But other end-presentations are lurking in our\nforeconscious that originate from the sources of our unconscious and\nfrom the ever active wishes. These may take possession of the\nexcitations in the circle of thought thus left to itself, establish a\nconnection between it and the unconscious wish, and transfer to it the\nenergy inherent in the unconscious wish. Henceforth the neglected or\nsuppressed train of thought is in a position to maintain itself,\nalthough this reinforcement does not help it to gain access to\nconsciousness. We may say that the hitherto foreconscious train of\nthought has been drawn into the unconscious.\nOther constellations for the dream formation would result if the\nforeconscious train of thought had from the beginning been connected\nwith the unconscious wish, and for that reason met with rejection by the\ndominating end-occupation; or if an unconscious wish were made active\nfor other--possibly somatic--reasons and of its own accord sought a\ntransference to the psychic remnants not occupied by the Forec. All\nthree cases finally combine in one issue, so that there is established\nin the foreconscious a stream of thought which, having been abandoned by\nthe foreconscious occupation, receives occupation from the unconscious\nwish.\nThe stream of thought is henceforth subjected to a series of\ntransformations which we no longer recognize as normal psychic processes\nand which give us a surprising result, viz. a psychopathological\nformation. Let us emphasize and group the same.\n1. The intensities of the individual ideas become capable of discharge\nin their entirety, and, proceeding from one conception to the other,\nthey thus form single presentations endowed with marked intensity.\nThrough the repeated recurrence of this process the intensity of an\nentire train of ideas may ultimately be gathered in a single\npresentation element. This is the principle of _compression or\ncondensation_. It is condensation that is mainly responsible for the\nstrange impression of the dream, for we know of nothing analogous to it\nin the normal psychic life accessible to consciousness. We find here,\nalso, presentations which possess great psychic significance as\njunctions or as end-results of whole chains of thought; but this\nvalidity does not manifest itself in any character conspicuous enough\nfor internal perception; hence, what has been presented in it does not\nbecome in any way more intensive. In the process of condensation the\nentire psychic connection becomes transformed into the intensity of the\npresentation content. It is the same as in a book where we space or\nprint in heavy type any word upon which particular stress is laid for\nthe understanding of the text. In speech the same word would be\npronounced loudly and deliberately and with emphasis. The first\ncomparison leads us at once to an example taken from the chapter on \"The\nDream-Work\" (trimethylamine in the dream of Irma's injection).\nHistorians of art call our attention to the fact that the most ancient\nhistorical sculptures follow a similar principle in expressing the rank\nof the persons represented by the size of the statue. The king is made\ntwo or three times as large as his retinue or the vanquished enemy. A\npiece of art, however, from the Roman period makes use of more subtle\nmeans to accomplish the same purpose. The figure of the emperor is\nplaced in the center in a firmly erect posture; special care is bestowed\non the proper modelling of his figure; his enemies are seen cowering at\nhis feet; but he is no longer represented a giant among dwarfs. However,\nthe bowing of the subordinate to his superior in our own days is only an\necho of that ancient principle of representation.\nThe direction taken by the condensations of the dream is prescribed on\nthe one hand by the true foreconscious relations of the dream thoughts,\nan the other hand by the attraction of the visual reminiscences in the\nunconscious. The success of the condensation work produces those\nintensities which are required for penetration into the perception\nsystems.\n2. Through this free transferability of the intensities, moreover, and\nin the service of condensation, _intermediary\npresentations_--compromises, as it were--are formed (_cf._ the numerous\nexamples). This, likewise, is something unheard of in the normal\npresentation course, where it is above all a question of selection and\nretention of the \"proper\" presentation element. On the other hand,\ncomposite and compromise formations occur with extraordinary frequency\nwhen we are trying to find the linguistic expression for foreconscious\nthoughts; these are considered \"slips of the tongue.\"\n3. The presentations which transfer their intensities to one another are\n_very loosely connected_, and are joined together by such forms of\nassociation as are spurned in our serious thought and are utilized in\nthe production of the effect of wit only. Among these we particularly\nfind associations of the sound and consonance types.\n4. Contradictory thoughts do not strive to eliminate one another, but\nremain side by side. They often unite to produce condensation _as if no\ncontradiction_ existed, or they form compromises for which we should\nnever forgive our thoughts, but which we frequently approve of in our\nactions.\nThese are some of the most conspicuous abnormal processes to which the\nthoughts which have previously been rationally formed are subjected in\nthe course of the dream-work. As the main feature of these processes we\nrecognize the high importance attached to the fact of rendering the\noccupation energy mobile and capable of discharge; the content and the\nactual significance of the psychic elements, to which these energies\nadhere, become a matter of secondary importance. One might possibly\nthink that the condensation and compromise formation is effected only in\nthe service of regression, when occasion arises for changing thoughts\ninto pictures. But the analysis and--still more distinctly--the\nsynthesis of dreams which lack regression toward pictures, _e.g._ the\ndream \"Autodidasker--Conversation with Court-Councilor N.,\" present the\nsame processes of displacement and condensation as the others.\nHence we cannot refuse to acknowledge that the two kinds of essentially\ndifferent psychic processes participate in the formation of the dream;\none forms perfectly correct dream thoughts which are equivalent to\nnormal thoughts, while the other treats these ideas in a highly\nsurprising and incorrect manner. The latter process we have already set\napart as the dream-work proper. What have we now to advance concerning\nthis latter psychic process?\nWe should be unable to answer this question here if we had not\npenetrated considerably into the psychology of the neuroses and\nespecially of hysteria. From this we learn that the same incorrect\npsychic processes--as well as others that have not been\nenumerated--control the formation of hysterical symptoms. In hysteria,\ntoo, we at once find a series of perfectly correct thoughts equivalent\nto our conscious thoughts, of whose existence, however, in this form we\ncan learn nothing and which we can only subsequently reconstruct. If\nthey have forced their way anywhere to our perception, we discover from\nthe analysis of the symptom formed that these normal thoughts have been\nsubjected to abnormal treatment and _have been transformed into the\nsymptom by means of condensation and compromise formation, through\nsuperficial associations, under cover of contradictions, and eventually\nover the road of regression_. In view of the complete identity found\nbetween the peculiarities of the dream-work and of the psychic activity\nforming the psychoneurotic symptoms, we shall feel justified in\ntransferring to the dream the conclusions urged upon us by hysteria.\nFrom the theory of hysteria we borrow the proposition that _such an\nabnormal psychic elaboration of a normal train of thought takes place\nonly when the latter has been used for the transference of an\nunconscious wish which dates from the infantile life and is in a state\nof repression_. In accordance with this proposition we have construed\nthe theory of the dream on the assumption that the actuating dream-wish\ninvariably originates in the unconscious, which, as we ourselves have\nadmitted, cannot be universally demonstrated though it cannot be\nrefuted. But in order to explain the real meaning of the term\n_repression_, which we have employed so freely, we shall be obliged to\nmake some further addition to our psychological construction.\nWe have above elaborated the fiction of a primitive psychic apparatus,\nwhose work is regulated by the efforts to avoid accumulation of\nexcitement and as far as possible to maintain itself free from\nexcitement. For this reason it was constructed after the plan of a\nreflex apparatus; the motility, originally the path for the inner bodily\nchange, formed a discharging path standing at its disposal. We\nsubsequently discussed the psychic results of a feeling of\ngratification, and we might at the same time have introduced the second\nassumption, viz. that accumulation of excitement--following certain\nmodalities that do not concern us--is perceived as pain and sets the\napparatus in motion in order to reproduce a feeling of gratification in\nwhich the diminution of the excitement is perceived as pleasure. Such a\ncurrent in the apparatus which emanates from pain and strives for\npleasure we call a wish. We have said that nothing but a wish is capable\nof setting the apparatus in motion, and that the discharge of excitement\nin the apparatus is regulated automatically by the perception of\npleasure and pain. The first wish must have been an hallucinatory\noccupation of the memory for gratification. But this hallucination,\nunless it were maintained to the point of exhaustion, proved incapable\nof bringing about a cessation of the desire and consequently of securing\nthe pleasure connected with gratification.\nThus there was required a second activity--in our terminology the\nactivity of a second system--which should not permit the memory\noccupation to advance to perception and therefrom to restrict the\npsychic forces, but should lead the excitement emanating from the\ncraving stimulus by a devious path over the spontaneous motility which\nultimately should so change the outer world as to allow the real\nperception of the object of gratification to take place. Thus far we\nhave elaborated the plan of the psychic apparatus; these two systems are\nthe germ of the Unc. and Forec, which we include in the fully developed\napparatus.\nIn order to be in a position successfully to change the outer world\nthrough the motility, there is required the accumulation of a large sum\nof experiences in the memory systems as well as a manifold fixation of\nthe relations which are evoked in this memory material by different\nend-presentations. We now proceed further with our assumption. The\nmanifold activity of the second system, tentatively sending forth and\nretracting energy, must on the one hand have full command over all\nmemory material, but on the other hand it would be a superfluous\nexpenditure for it to send to the individual mental paths large\nquantities of energy which would thus flow off to no purpose,\ndiminishing the quantity available for the transformation of the outer\nworld. In the interests of expediency I therefore postulate that the\nsecond system succeeds in maintaining the greater part of the occupation\nenergy in a dormant state and in using but a small portion for the\npurposes of displacement. The mechanism of these processes is entirely\nunknown to me; any one who wishes to follow up these ideas must try to\nfind the physical analogies and prepare the way for a demonstration of\nthe process of motion in the stimulation of the neuron. I merely hold to\nthe idea that the activity of the first [Greek: Psi]-system is directed\n_to the free outflow of the quantities of excitement_, and that the\nsecond system brings about an inhibition of this outflow through the\nenergies emanating from it, _i.e._ it produces a _transformation into\ndormant energy, probably by raising the level_. I therefore assume that\nunder the control of the second system as compared with the first, the\ncourse of the excitement is bound to entirely different mechanical\nconditions. After the second system has finished its tentative mental\nwork, it removes the inhibition and congestion of the excitements and\nallows these excitements to flow off to the motility.\nAn interesting train of thought now presents itself if we consider the\nrelations of this inhibition of discharge by the second system to the\nregulation through the principle of pain. Let us now seek the\ncounterpart of the primary feeling of gratification, namely, the\nobjective feeling of fear. A perceptive stimulus acts on the primitive\napparatus, becoming the source of a painful emotion. This will then be\nfollowed by irregular motor manifestations until one of these withdraws\nthe apparatus from perception and at the same time from pain, but on the\nreappearance of the perception this manifestation will immediately\nrepeat itself (perhaps as a movement of flight) until the perception has\nagain disappeared. But there will here remain no tendency again to\noccupy the perception of the source of pain in the form of an\nhallucination or in any other form. On the contrary, there will be a\ntendency in the primary apparatus to abandon the painful memory picture\nas soon as it is in any way awakened, as the overflow of its excitement\nwould surely produce (more precisely, begin to produce) pain. The\ndeviation from memory, which is but a repetition of the former flight\nfrom perception, is facilitated also by the fact that, unlike\nperception, memory does not possess sufficient quality to excite\nconsciousness and thereby to attract to itself new energy. This easy and\nregularly occurring deviation of the psychic process from the former\npainful memory presents to us the model and the first example of\n_psychic repression_. As is generally known, much of this deviation from\nthe painful, much of the behavior of the ostrich, can be readily\ndemonstrated even in the normal psychic life of adults.\nBy virtue of the principle of pain the first system is therefore\naltogether incapable of introducing anything unpleasant into the mental\nassociations. The system cannot do anything but wish. If this remained\nso the mental activity of the second system, which should have at its\ndisposal all the memories stored up by experiences, would be hindered.\nBut two ways are now opened: the work of the second system either frees\nitself completely from the principle of pain and continues its course,\npaying no heed to the painful reminiscence, or it contrives to occupy\nthe painful memory in such a manner as to preclude the liberation of\npain. We may reject the first possibility, as the principle of pain also\nmanifests itself as a regulator for the emotional discharge of the\nsecond system; we are, therefore, directed to the second possibility,\nnamely, that this system occupies a reminiscence in such a manner as to\ninhibit its discharge and hence, also, to inhibit the discharge\ncomparable to a motor innervation for the development of pain. Thus from\ntwo starting points we are led to the hypothesis that occupation through\nthe second system is at the same time an inhibition for the emotional\ndischarge, viz. from a consideration of the principle of pain and from\nthe principle of the smallest expenditure of innervation. Let us,\nhowever, keep to the fact--this is the key to the theory of\nrepression--that the second system is capable of occupying an idea only\nwhen it is in position to check the development of pain emanating from\nit. Whatever withdraws itself from this inhibition also remains\ninaccessible for the second system and would soon be abandoned by virtue\nof the principle of pain. The inhibition of pain, however, need not be\ncomplete; it must be permitted to begin, as it indicates to the second\nsystem the nature of the memory and possibly its defective adaptation\nfor the purpose sought by the mind.\nThe psychic process which is admitted by the first system only I shall\nnow call the _primary_ process; and the one resulting from the\ninhibition of the second system I shall call the _secondary_ process. I\nshow by another point for what purpose the second system is obliged to\ncorrect the primary process. The primary process strives for a discharge\nof the excitement in order to establish a _perception_ identity with the\nsum of excitement thus gathered; the secondary process has abandoned\nthis intention and undertaken instead the task of bringing about a\n_thought identity_. All thinking is only a circuitous path from the\nmemory of gratification taken as an end-presentation to the identical\noccupation of the same memory, which is again to be attained on the\ntrack of the motor experiences. The state of thinking must take an\ninterest in the connecting paths between the presentations without\nallowing itself to be misled by their intensities. But it is obvious\nthat condensations and intermediate or compromise formations occurring\nin the presentations impede the attainment of this end-identity; by\nsubstituting one idea for the other they deviate from the path which\notherwise would have been continued from the original idea. Such\nprocesses are therefore carefully avoided in the secondary thinking. Nor\nis it difficult to understand that the principle of pain also impedes\nthe progress of the mental stream in its pursuit of the thought\nidentity, though, indeed, it offers to the mental stream the most\nimportant points of departure. Hence the tendency of the thinking\nprocess must be to free itself more and more from exclusive adjustment\nby the principle of pain, and through the working of the mind to\nrestrict the affective development to that minimum which is necessary as\na signal. This refinement of the activity must have been attained\nthrough a recent over-occupation of energy brought about by\nconsciousness. But we are aware that this refinement is seldom\ncompletely successful even in the most normal psychic life and that our\nthoughts ever remain accessible to falsification through the\ninterference of the principle of pain.\nThis, however, is not the breach in the functional efficiency of our\npsychic apparatus through which the thoughts forming the material of the\nsecondary mental work are enabled to make their way into the primary\npsychic process--with which formula we may now describe the work leading\nto the dream and to the hysterical symptoms. This case of insufficiency\nresults from the union of the two factors from the history of our\nevolution; one of which belongs solely to the psychic apparatus and has\nexerted a determining influence on the relation of the two systems,\nwhile the other operates fluctuatingly and introduces motive forces of\norganic origin into the psychic life. Both originate in the infantile\nlife and result from the transformation which our psychic and somatic\norganism has undergone since the infantile period.\nWhen I termed one of the psychic processes in the psychic apparatus the\nprimary process, I did so not only in consideration of the order of\nprecedence and capability, but also as admitting the temporal relations\nto a share in the nomenclature. As far as our knowledge goes there is no\npsychic apparatus possessing only the primary process, and in so far it\nis a theoretic fiction; but so much is based on fact that the primary\nprocesses are present in the apparatus from the beginning, while the\nsecondary processes develop gradually in the course of life, inhibiting\nand covering the primary ones, and gaining complete mastery over them\nperhaps only at the height of life. Owing to this retarded appearance of\nthe secondary processes, the essence of our being, consisting in\nunconscious wish feelings, can neither be seized nor inhibited by the\nforeconscious, whose part is once for all restricted to the indication\nof the most suitable paths for the wish feelings originating in the\nunconscious. These unconscious wishes establish for all subsequent\npsychic efforts a compulsion to which they have to submit and which\nthey must strive if possible to divert from its course and direct to\nhigher aims. In consequence of this retardation of the foreconscious\noccupation a large sphere of the memory material remains inaccessible.\nAmong these indestructible and unincumbered wish feelings originating\nfrom the infantile life, there are also some, the fulfillments of which\nhave entered into a relation of contradiction to the end-presentation of\nthe secondary thinking. The fulfillment of these wishes would no longer\nproduce an affect of pleasure but one of pain; _and it is just this\ntransformation of affect that constitutes the nature of what we\ndesignate as \"repression,\" in which we recognize the infantile first\nstep of passing adverse sentence or of rejecting through reason_. To\ninvestigate in what way and through what motive forces such a\ntransformation can be produced constitutes the problem of repression,\nwhich we need here only skim over. It will suffice to remark that such a\ntransformation of affect occurs in the course of development (one may\nthink of the appearance in infantile life of disgust which was\noriginally absent), and that it is connected with the activity of the\nsecondary system. The memories from which the unconscious wish brings\nabout the emotional discharge have never been accessible to the Forec.,\nand for that reason their emotional discharge cannot be inhibited. It\nis just on account of this affective development that these ideas are\nnot even now accessible to the foreconscious thoughts to which they have\ntransferred their wishing power. On the contrary, the principle of pain\ncomes into play, and causes the Forec. to deviate from these thoughts of\ntransference. The latter, left to themselves, are \"repressed,\" and thus\nthe existence of a store of infantile memories, from the very beginning\nwithdrawn from the Forec., becomes the preliminary condition of\nrepression.\nIn the most favorable case the development of pain terminates as soon as\nthe energy has been withdrawn from the thoughts of transference in the\nForec., and this effect characterizes the intervention of the principle\nof pain as expedient. It is different, however, if the repressed\nunconscious wish receives an organic enforcement which it can lend to\nits thoughts of transference and through which it can enable them to\nmake an effort towards penetration with their excitement, even after\nthey have been abandoned by the occupation of the Forec. A defensive\nstruggle then ensues, inasmuch as the Forec. reinforces the antagonism\nagainst the repressed ideas, and subsequently this leads to a\npenetration by the thoughts of transference (the carriers of the\nunconscious wish) in some form of compromise through symptom formation.\nBut from the moment that the suppressed thoughts are powerfully occupied\nby the unconscious wish-feeling and abandoned by the foreconscious\noccupation, they succumb to the primary psychic process and strive only\nfor motor discharge; or, if the path be free, for hallucinatory revival\nof the desired perception identity. We have previously found,\nempirically, that the incorrect processes described are enacted only\nwith thoughts that exist in the repression. We now grasp another part of\nthe connection. These incorrect processes are those that are primary in\nthe psychic apparatus; _they appear wherever thoughts abandoned by the\nforeconscious occupation are left to themselves, and can fill themselves\nwith the uninhibited energy, striving for discharge from the\nunconscious_. We may add a few further observations to support the view\nthat these processes designated \"incorrect\" are really not\nfalsifications of the normal defective thinking, but the modes of\nactivity of the psychic apparatus when freed from inhibition. Thus we\nsee that the transference of the foreconscious excitement to the\nmotility takes place according to the same processes, and that the\nconnection of the foreconscious presentations with words readily\nmanifest the same displacements and mixtures which are ascribed to\ninattention. Finally, I should like to adduce proof that an increase of\nwork necessarily results from the inhibition of these primary courses\nfrom the fact that we gain a _comical effect_, a surplus to be\ndischarged through laughter, _if we allow these streams of thought to\ncome to consciousness_.\nThe theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with complete certainty that\nonly sexual wish-feelings from the infantile life experience repression\n(emotional transformation) during the developmental period of childhood.\nThese are capable of returning to activity at a later period of\ndevelopment, and then have the faculty of being revived, either as a\nconsequence of the sexual constitution, which is really formed from the\noriginal bisexuality, or in consequence of unfavorable influences of the\nsexual life; and they thus supply the motive power for all\npsychoneurotic symptom formations. It is only by the introduction of\nthese sexual forces that the gaps still demonstrable in the theory of\nrepression can be filled. I will leave it undecided whether the\npostulate of the sexual and infantile may also be asserted for the\ntheory of the dream; I leave this here unfinished because I have already\npassed a step beyond the demonstrable in assuming that the dream-wish\ninvariably originates from the unconscious.[2] Nor will I further\ninvestigate the difference in the play of the psychic forces in the\ndream formation and in the formation of the hysterical symptoms, for to\ndo this we ought to possess a more explicit knowledge of one of the\nmembers to be compared. But I regard another point as important, and\nwill here confess that it was on account of this very point that I have\njust undertaken this entire discussion concerning the two psychic\nsystems, their modes of operation, and the repression. For it is now\nimmaterial whether I have conceived the psychological relations in\nquestion with approximate correctness, or, as is easily possible in such\na difficult matter, in an erroneous and fragmentary manner. Whatever\nchanges may be made in the interpretation of the psychic censor and of\nthe correct and of the abnormal elaboration of the dream content, the\nfact nevertheless remains that such processes are active in dream\nformation, and that essentially they show the closest analogy to the\nprocesses observed in the formation of the hysterical symptoms. The\ndream is not a pathological phenomenon, and it does not leave behind an\nenfeeblement of the mental faculties. The objection that no deduction\ncan be drawn regarding the dreams of healthy persons from my own dreams\nand from those of neurotic patients may be rejected without comment.\nHence, when we draw conclusions from the phenomena as to their motive\nforces, we recognize that the psychic mechanism made use of by the\nneuroses is not created by a morbid disturbance of the psychic life, but\nis found ready in the normal structure of the psychic apparatus. The two\npsychic systems, the censor crossing between them, the inhibition and\nthe covering of the one activity by the other, the relations of both to\nconsciousness--or whatever may offer a more correct interpretation of\nthe actual conditions in their stead--all these belong to the normal\nstructure of our psychic instrument, and the dream points out for us one\nof the roads leading to a knowledge of this structure. If, in addition\nto our knowledge, we wish to be contented with a minimum perfectly\nestablished, we shall say that the dream gives us proof that the\n_suppressed, material continues to exist even in the normal person and\nremains capable of psychic activity_. The dream itself is one of the\nmanifestations of this suppressed material; theoretically, this is true\nin _all_ cases; according to substantial experience it is true in at\nleast a great number of such as most conspicuously display the prominent\ncharacteristics of dream life. The suppressed psychic material, which in\nthe waking state has been prevented from expression and cut off from\ninternal perception _by the antagonistic adjustment of the\ncontradictions_, finds ways and means of obtruding itself on\nconsciousness during the night under the domination of the compromise\nformations.\n_\"Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo.\"_\nAt any rate the interpretation of dreams is the _via regia_ to a\nknowledge of the unconscious in the psychic life.\nIn following the analysis of the dream we have made some progress toward\nan understanding of the composition of this most marvelous and most\nmysterious of instruments; to be sure, we have not gone very far, but\nenough of a beginning has been made to allow us to advance from other\nso-called pathological formations further into the analysis of the\nunconscious. Disease--at least that which is justly termed\nfunctional--is not due to the destruction of this apparatus, and the\nestablishment of new splittings in its interior; it is rather to be\nexplained dynamically through the strengthening and weakening of the\ncomponents in the play of forces by which so many activities are\nconcealed during the normal function. We have been able to show in\nanother place how the composition of the apparatus from the two systems\npermits a subtilization even of the normal activity which would be\nimpossible for a single system.\n[1] _Cf._ the significant observations by J. Bueuer in our _Studies on\nHysteria_, 1895, and 2nd ed. 1909.\n[2] Here, as in other places, there are gaps in the treatment of the\nsubject, which I have left intentionally, because to fill them up would\nrequire on the one hand too great effort, and on the other hand an\nextensive reference to material that is foreign to the dream. Thus I\nhave avoided stating whether I connect with the word \"suppressed\"\nanother sense than with the word \"repressed.\" It has been made clear\nonly that the latter emphasizes more than the former the relation to the\nunconscious. I have not entered into the cognate problem why the dream\nthoughts also experience distortion by the censor when they abandon the\nprogressive continuation to consciousness and choose the path of\nregression. I have been above all anxious to awaken an interest in the\nproblems to which the further analysis of the dreamwork leads and to\nindicate the other themes which meet these on the way. It was not always\neasy to decide just where the pursuit should be discontinued. That I\nhave not treated exhaustively the part played in the dream by the\npsychosexual life and have avoided the interpretation of dreams of an\nobvious sexual content is due to a special reason which may not come up\nto the reader's expectation. To be sure, it is very far from my ideas\nand the principles expressed by me in neuropathology to regard the\nsexual life as a \"pudendum\" which should be left unconsidered by the\nphysician and the scientific investigator. I also consider ludicrous the\nmoral indignation which prompted the translator of Artemidoros of Daldis\nto keep from the reader's knowledge the chapter on sexual dreams\ncontained in the _Symbolism of the Dreams_. As for myself, I have been\nactuated solely by the conviction that in the explanation of sexual\ndreams I should be bound to entangle myself deeply in the still\nunexplained problems of perversion and bisexuality; and for that reason\nI have reserved this material for another connection.\nIX\nTHE UNCONSCIOUS AND CONSCIOUSNESS--REALITY\nOn closer inspection we find that it is not the existence of two systems\nnear the motor end of the apparatus but of two kinds of processes or\nmodes of emotional discharge, the assumption of which was explained in\nthe psychological discussions of the previous chapter. This can make no\ndifference for us, for we must always be ready to drop our auxiliary\nideas whenever we deem ourselves in position to replace them by\nsomething else approaching more closely to the unknown reality. Let us\nnow try to correct some views which might be erroneously formed as long\nas we regarded the two systems in the crudest and most obvious sense as\ntwo localities within the psychic apparatus, views which have left their\ntraces in the terms \"repression\" and \"penetration.\" Thus, when we say\nthat an unconscious idea strives for transference into the foreconscious\nin order later to penetrate consciousness, we do not mean that a second\nidea is to be formed situated in a new locality like an interlineation\nnear which the original continues to remain; also, when we speak of\npenetration into consciousness, we wish carefully to avoid any idea of\nchange of locality. When we say that a foreconscious idea is repressed\nand subsequently taken up by the unconscious, we might be tempted by\nthese figures, borrowed from the idea of a struggle over a territory, to\nassume that an arrangement is really broken up in one psychic locality\nand replaced by a new one in the other locality. For these comparisons\nwe substitute what would seem to correspond better with the real state\nof affairs by saying that an energy occupation is displaced to or\nwithdrawn from a certain arrangement so that the psychic formation falls\nunder the domination of a system or is withdrawn from the same. Here\nagain we replace a topical mode of presentation by a dynamic; it is not\nthe psychic formation that appears to us as the moving factor but the\ninnervation of the same.\nI deem it appropriate and justifiable, however, to apply ourselves still\nfurther to the illustrative conception of the two systems. We shall\navoid any misapplication of this manner of representation if we remember\nthat presentations, thoughts, and psychic formations should generally\nnot be localized in the organic elements of the nervous system, but, so\nto speak, between them, where resistances and paths form the correlate\ncorresponding to them. Everything that can become an object of our\ninternal perception is virtual, like the image in the telescope produced\nby the passage of the rays of light. But we are justified in assuming\nthe existence of the systems, which have nothing psychic in themselves\nand which never become accessible to our psychic perception,\ncorresponding to the lenses of the telescope which design the image. If\nwe continue this comparison, we may say that the censor between two\nsystems corresponds to the refraction of rays during their passage into\na new medium.\nThus far we have made psychology on our own responsibility; it is now\ntime to examine the theoretical opinions governing present-day\npsychology and to test their relation to our theories. The question of\nthe unconscious, in psychology is, according to the authoritative words\nof Lipps, less a psychological question than the question of psychology.\nAs long as psychology settled this question with the verbal explanation\nthat the \"psychic\" is the \"conscious\" and that \"unconscious psychic\noccurrences\" are an obvious contradiction, a psychological estimate of\nthe observations gained by the physician from abnormal mental states was\nprecluded. The physician and the philosopher agree only when both\nacknowledge that unconscious psychic processes are \"the appropriate and\nwell-justified expression for an established fact.\" The physician cannot\nbut reject with a shrug of his shoulders the assertion that\n\"consciousness is the indispensable quality of the psychic\"; he may\nassume, if his respect for the utterings of the philosophers still be\nstrong enough, that he and they do not treat the same subject and do not\npursue the same science. For a single intelligent observation of the\npsychic life of a neurotic, a single analysis of a dream must force upon\nhim the unalterable conviction that the most complicated and correct\nmental operations, to which no one will refuse the name of psychic\noccurrences, may take place without exciting the consciousness of the\nperson. It is true that the physician does not learn of these\nunconscious processes until they have exerted such an effect on\nconsciousness as to admit communication or observation. But this effect\nof consciousness may show a psychic character widely differing from the\nunconscious process, so that the internal perception cannot possibly\nrecognize the one as a substitute for the other. The physician must\nreserve for himself the right to penetrate, by a process of deduction,\nfrom the effect on consciousness to the unconscious psychic process; he\nlearns in this way that the effect on consciousness is only a remote\npsychic product of the unconscious process and that the latter has not\nbecome conscious as such; that it has been in existence and operative\nwithout betraying itself in any way to consciousness.\nA reaction from the over-estimation of the quality of consciousness\nbecomes the indispensable preliminary condition for any correct insight\ninto the behavior of the psychic. In the words of Lipps, the unconscious\nmust be accepted as the general basis of the psychic life. The\nunconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself the\nsmaller circle of the conscious; everything conscious has its\npreliminary step in the unconscious, whereas the unconscious may stop\nwith this step and still claim full value as a psychic activity.\nProperly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; _its inner\nnature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world,\nand it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of\nconsciousness as is the external world through the indications of our\nsensory organs_.\nA series of dream problems which have intensely occupied older authors\nwill be laid aside when the old opposition between conscious life and\ndream life is abandoned and the unconscious psychic assigned to its\nproper place. Thus many of the activities whose performances in the\ndream have excited our admiration are now no longer to be attributed to\nthe dream but to unconscious thinking, which is also active during the\nday. If, according to Scherner, the dream seems to play with a symboling\nrepresentation of the body, we know that this is the work of certain\nunconscious phantasies which have probably given in to sexual emotions,\nand that these phantasies come to expression not only in dreams but also\nin hysterical phobias and in other symptoms. If the dream continues and\nsettles activities of the day and even brings to light valuable\ninspirations, we have only to subtract from it the dream disguise as a\nfeat of dream-work and a mark of assistance from obscure forces in the\ndepth of the mind (_cf._ the devil in Tartini's sonata dream). The\nintellectual task as such must be attributed to the same psychic forces\nwhich perform all such tasks during the day. We are probably far too\nmuch inclined to over-estimate the conscious character even of\nintellectual and artistic productions. From the communications of some\nof the most highly productive persons, such as Goethe and Helmholtz, we\nlearn, indeed, that the most essential and original parts in their\ncreations came to them in the form of inspirations and reached their\nperceptions almost finished. There is nothing strange about the\nassistance of the conscious activity in other cases where there was a\nconcerted effort of all the psychic forces. But it is a much abused\nprivilege of the conscious activity that it is allowed to hide from us\nall other activities wherever it participates.\nIt will hardly be worth while to take up the historical significance of\ndreams as a special subject. Where, for instance, a chieftain has been\nurged through a dream to engage in a bold undertaking the success of\nwhich has had the effect of changing history, a new problem results only\nso long as the dream, regarded as a strange power, is contrasted with\nother more familiar psychic forces; the problem, however, disappears\nwhen we regard the dream as a form of expression for feelings which are\nburdened with resistance during the day and which can receive\nreinforcements at night from deep emotional sources. But the great\nrespect shown by the ancients for the dream is based on a correct\npsychological surmise. It is a homage paid to the unsubdued and\nindestructible in the human mind, and to the demoniacal which furnishes\nthe dream-wish and which we find again in our unconscious.\nNot inadvisedly do I use the expression \"in our unconscious,\" for what\nwe so designate does not coincide with the unconscious of the\nphilosophers, nor with the unconscious of Lipps. In the latter uses it\nis intended to designate only the opposite of conscious. That there are\nalso unconscious psychic processes beside the conscious ones is the\nhotly contested and energetically defended issue. Lipps gives us the\nmore far-reaching theory that everything psychic exists as unconscious,\nbut that some of it may exist also as conscious. But it was not to prove\nthis theory that we have adduced the phenomena of the dream and of the\nhysterical symptom formation; the observation of normal life alone\nsuffices to establish its correctness beyond any doubt. The new fact\nthat we have learned from the analysis of the psychopathological\nformations, and indeed from their first member, viz. dreams, is that the\nunconscious--hence the psychic--occurs as a function of two separate\nsystems and that it occurs as such even in normal psychic life.\nConsequently there are two kinds of unconscious, which we do not as yet\nfind distinguished by the psychologists. Both are unconscious in the\npsychological sense; but in our sense the first, which we call Unc., is\nlikewise incapable of consciousness, whereas the second we term \"Forec.\"\nbecause its emotions, after the observance of certain rules, can reach\nconsciousness, perhaps not before they have again undergone censorship,\nbut still regardless of the Unc. system. The fact that in order to\nattain consciousness the emotions must traverse an unalterable series of\nevents or succession of instances, as is betrayed through their\nalteration by the censor, has helped us to draw a comparison from\nspatiality. We described the relations of the two systems to each other\nand to consciousness by saying that the system Forec. is like a screen\nbetween the system Unc. and consciousness. The system Forec. not only\nbars access to consciousness, but also controls the entrance to\nvoluntary motility and is capable of sending out a sum of mobile energy,\na portion of which is familiar to us as attention.\nWe must also steer clear of the distinctions superconscious and\nsubconscious which have found so much favor in the more recent\nliterature on the psychoneuroses, for just such a distinction seems to\nemphasize the equivalence of the psychic and the conscious.\nWhat part now remains in our description of the once all-powerful and\nall-overshadowing consciousness? None other than that of a sensory organ\nfor the perception of psychic qualities. According to the fundamental\nidea of schematic undertaking we can conceive the conscious perception\nonly as the particular activity of an independent system for which the\nabbreviated designation \"Cons.\" commends itself. This system we conceive\nto be similar in its mechanical characteristics to the perception system\nP, hence excitable by qualities and incapable of retaining the trace of\nchanges, _i.e._ it is devoid of memory. The psychic apparatus which,\nwith the sensory organs of the P-system, is turned to the outer world,\nis itself the outer world for the sensory organ of Cons.; the\nteleological justification of which rests on this relationship. We are\nhere once more confronted with the principle of the succession of\ninstances which seems to dominate the structure of the apparatus. The\nmaterial under excitement flows to the Cons, sensory organ from two\nsides, firstly from the P-system whose excitement, qualitatively\ndetermined, probably experiences a new elaboration until it comes to\nconscious perception; and, secondly, from the interior of the apparatus\nitself, the quantitative processes of which are perceived as a\nqualitative series of pleasure and pain as soon as they have undergone\ncertain changes.\nThe philosophers, who have learned that correct and highly complicated\nthought structures are possible even without the co\u00f6peration of\nconsciousness, have found it difficult to attribute any function to\nconsciousness; it has appeared to them a superfluous mirroring of the\nperfected psychic process. The analogy of our Cons. system with the\nsystems of perception relieves us of this embarrassment. We see that\nperception through our sensory organs results in directing the\noccupation of attention to those paths on which the incoming sensory\nexcitement is diffused; the qualitative excitement of the P-system\nserves the mobile quantity of the psychic apparatus as a regulator for\nits discharge. We may claim the same function for the overlying sensory\norgan of the Cons. system. By assuming new qualities, it furnishes a new\ncontribution toward the guidance and suitable distribution of the mobile\noccupation quantities. By means of the perceptions of pleasure and pain,\nit influences the course of the occupations within the psychic\napparatus, which normally operates unconsciously and through the\ndisplacement of quantities. It is probable that the principle of pain\nfirst regulates the displacements of occupation automatically, but it is\nquite possible that the consciousness of these qualities adds a second\nand more subtle regulation which may even oppose the first and perfect\nthe working capacity of the apparatus by placing it in a position\ncontrary to its original design for occupying and developing even that\nwhich is connected with the liberation of pain. We learn from\nneuropsychology that an important part in the functional activity of the\napparatus is attributed to such regulations through the qualitative\nexcitation of the sensory organs. The automatic control of the primary\nprinciple of pain and the restriction of mental capacity connected with\nit are broken by the sensible regulations, which in their turn are again\nautomatisms. We learn that the repression which, though originally\nexpedient, terminates nevertheless in a harmful rejection of inhibition\nand of psychic domination, is so much more easily accomplished with\nreminiscences than with perceptions, because in the former there is no\nincrease in occupation through the excitement of the psychic sensory\norgans. When an idea to be rejected has once failed to become conscious\nbecause it has succumbed to repression, it can be repressed on other\noccasions only because it has been withdrawn from conscious perception\non other grounds. These are hints employed by therapy in order to bring\nabout a retrogression of accomplished repressions.\nThe value of the over-occupation which is produced by the regulating\ninfluence of the Cons. sensory organ on the mobile quantity, is\ndemonstrated in the teleological connection by nothing more clearly than\nby the creation of a new series of qualities and consequently a new\nregulation which constitutes the precedence of man over the animals. For\nthe mental processes are in themselves devoid of quality except for the\nexcitements of pleasure and pain accompanying them, which, as we know,\nare to be held in check as possible disturbances of thought. In order to\nendow them with a quality, they are associated in man with verbal\nmemories, the qualitative remnants of which suffice to draw upon them\nthe attention of consciousness which in turn endows thought with a new\nmobile energy.\nThe manifold problems of consciousness in their entirety can be examined\nonly through an analysis of the hysterical mental process. From this\nanalysis we receive the impression that the transition from the\nforeconscious to the occupation of consciousness is also connected with\na censorship similar to the one between the Unc. and the Forec. This\ncensorship, too, begins to act only with the reaching of a certain\nquantitative degree, so that few intense thought formations escape it.\nEvery possible case of detention from consciousness, as well as of\npenetration to consciousness, under restriction is found included within\nthe picture of the psychoneurotic phenomena; every case points to the\nintimate and twofold connection between the censor and consciousness. I\nshall conclude these psychological discussions with the report of two\nsuch occurrences.\nOn the occasion of a consultation a few years ago the subject was an\nintelligent and innocent-looking girl. Her attire was strange; whereas a\nwoman's garb is usually groomed to the last fold, she had one of her\nstockings hanging down and two of her waist buttons opened. She\ncomplained of pains in one of her legs, and exposed her leg unrequested.\nHer chief complaint, however, was in her own words as follows: She had a\nfeeling in her body as if something was stuck into it which moved to and\nfro and made her tremble through and through. This sometimes made her\nwhole body stiff. On hearing this, my colleague in consultation looked\nat me; the complaint was quite plain to him. To both of us it seemed\npeculiar that the patient's mother thought nothing of the matter; of\ncourse she herself must have been repeatedly in the situation described\nby her child. As for the girl, she had no idea of the import of her\nwords or she would never have allowed them to pass her lips. Here the\ncensor had been deceived so successfully that under the mask of an\ninnocent complaint a phantasy was admitted to consciousness which\notherwise would have remained in the foreconscious.\nAnother example: I began the psychoanalytic treatment of a boy of\nfourteen years who was suffering from _tic convulsif_, hysterical\nvomiting, headache, &c., by assuring him that, after closing his eyes,\nhe would see pictures or have ideas, which I requested him to\ncommunicate to me. He answered by describing pictures. The last\nimpression he had received before coming to me was visually revived in\nhis memory. He had played a game of checkers with his uncle, and now saw\nthe checkerboard before him. He commented on various positions that were\nfavorable or unfavorable, on moves that were not safe to make. He then\nsaw a dagger lying on the checker-board, an object belonging to his\nfather, but transferred to the checker-board by his phantasy. Then a\nsickle was lying on the board; next a scythe was added; and, finally, he\nbeheld the likeness of an old peasant mowing the grass in front of the\nboy's distant parental home. A few days later I discovered the meaning\nof this series of pictures. Disagreeable family relations had made the\nboy nervous. It was the case of a strict and crabbed father who lived\nunhappily with his mother, and whose educational methods consisted in\nthreats; of the separation of his father from his tender and delicate\nmother, and the remarrying of his father, who one day brought home a\nyoung woman as his new mamma. The illness of the fourteen-year-old boy\nbroke out a few days later. It was the suppressed anger against his\nfather that had composed these pictures into intelligible allusions. The\nmaterial was furnished by a reminiscence from mythology, The sickle was\nthe one with which Zeus castrated his father; the scythe and the\nlikeness of the peasant represented Kronos, the violent old man who eats\nhis children and upon whom Zeus wreaks vengeance in so unfilial a\nmanner. The marriage of the father gave the boy an opportunity to return\nthe reproaches and threats of his father--which had previously been made\nbecause the child played with his genitals (the checkerboard; the\nprohibitive moves; the dagger with which a person may be killed). We\nhave here long repressed memories and their unconscious remnants which,\nunder the guise of senseless pictures have slipped into consciousness by\ndevious paths left open to them.\nI should then expect to find the theoretical value of the study of\ndreams in its contribution to psychological knowledge and in its\npreparation for an understanding of neuroses. Who can foresee the\nimportance of a thorough knowledge of the structure and activities of\nthe psychic apparatus when even our present state of knowledge produces\na happy therapeutic influence in the curable forms of the\npsychoneuroses? What about the practical value of such study some one\nmay ask, for psychic knowledge and for the discovering of the secret\npeculiarities of individual character? Have not the unconscious feelings\nrevealed by the dream the value of real forces in the psychic life?\nShould we take lightly the ethical significance of the suppressed wishes\nwhich, as they now create dreams, may some day create other things?\nI do not feel justified in answering these questions. I have not thought\nfurther upon this side of the dream problem. I believe, however, that at\nall events the Roman Emperor was in the wrong who ordered one of his\nsubjects executed because the latter dreamt that he had killed the\nEmperor. He should first have endeavored to discover the significance of\nthe dream; most probably it was not what it seemed to be. And even if a\ndream of different content had the significance of this offense against\nmajesty, it would still have been in place to remember the words of\nPlato, that the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that which\nthe wicked man does in actual life. I am therefore of the opinion that\nit is best to accord freedom to dreams. Whether any reality is to be\nattributed to the unconscious wishes, and in what sense, I am not\nprepared to say offhand. Reality must naturally be denied to all\ntransition--and intermediate thoughts. If we had before us the\nunconscious wishes, brought to their last and truest expression, we\nshould still do well to remember that more than one single form of\nexistence must be ascribed to the psychic reality. Action and the\nconscious expression of thought mostly suffice for the practical need\nof judging a man's character. Action, above all, merits to be placed in\nthe first rank; for many of the impulses penetrating consciousness are\nneutralized by real forces of the psychic life before they are converted\ninto action; indeed, the reason why they frequently do not encounter any\npsychic obstacle on their way is because the unconscious is certain of\ntheir meeting with resistances later. In any case it is instructive to\nbecome familiar with the much raked-up soil from which our virtues\nproudly arise. For the complication of human character moving\ndynamically in all directions very rarely accommodates itself to\nadjustment through a simple alternative, as our antiquated moral\nphilosophy would have it.\nAnd how about the value of the dream for a knowledge of the future?\nThat, of course, we cannot consider. One feels inclined to substitute:\n\"for a knowledge of the past.\" For the dream originates from the past in\nevery sense. To be sure the ancient belief that the dream reveals the\nfuture is not entirely devoid of truth. By representing to us a wish as\nfulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the future; but this future,\ntaken by the dreamer as present, has been formed into the likeness of\nthat past by the indestructible wish.", "source": "dream_psychology.txt"}

BRILL, PH.B., M.D.\nCHIEF OF THE NEUROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE BRONX HOSPITAL AND\nDISPENSARY CLINICAL ASSISTANT IN NEUROLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY, COLUMBIA\nUNIVERSITY FORMER ASSISTANT PHYSICIAN IN THE CENTRAL ISLIP STATE\nHOSPITAL AND IN THE CLINIC OF PSYCHIATRY, Z\u00dcRICH\n\u201c_Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo_\u201d\nNEW YORK\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\n1913\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS\nIn attempting a discussion of the Interpretation of Dreams, I do not\nbelieve that I have overstepped the bounds of neuropathological\ninterest. For, on psychological investigation, the dream proves to be\nthe first link in a chain of abnormal psychic structures whose other\nlinks, the hysterical phobia, the obsession, and the delusion must, for\npractical reasons, claim the interest of the physician. The dream (as\nwill appear) can lay no claim to a corresponding practical significance;\nits theoretical value as a paradigm is, however, all the greater, and\none who cannot explain the origin of the dream pictures will strive in\nvain to understand the phobias, obsessive and delusional ideas, and\nlikewise their therapeutic importance.\nBut this relation, to which our subject owes its importance, is\nresponsible also for the deficiencies in the work before us. The\nsurfaces of fracture which will be found so frequently in this\ndiscussion correspond to so many points of contact at which the problem\nof the dream formation touches more comprehensive problems of\npsychopathology, which cannot be discussed here, and which will be\nsubjected to future elaboration if there should be sufficient time and\nenergy, and if further material should be forthcoming.\nPeculiarities in the material I have used to elucidate the\ninterpretation of dreams have rendered this publication difficult. From\nthe work itself it will appear why all dreams related in the literature\nor collected by others had to remain useless for my purpose; for\nexamples I had to choose between my own dreams and those of my patients\nwho were under psychoanalytic treatment. I was restrained from utilising\nthe latter material by the fact that in it the dream processes were\nsubjected to an undesirable complication on account of the intermixture\nof neurotic characters. On the other hand, inseparably connected with my\nown dreams was the circumstance that I was obliged to expose more of the\nintimacies of my psychic life than I should like and than generally\nfalls to the task of an author who is not a poet but an investigator of\nnature. This was painful, but unavoidable; I had to put up with the\ninevitable in order not to be obliged to forego altogether the\ndemonstration of the truth of my psychological results. To be sure, I\ncould not at best resist the temptation of disguising some of my\nindiscretions through omissions and substitutions, and as often as this\nhappened it detracted materially from the value of the examples which I\nemployed. I can only express the hope that the reader of this work,\nputting himself in my difficult position, will show forbearance, and\nalso that all persons who are inclined to take offence at any of the\ndreams reported will concede freedom of thought at least to the dream\nlife.\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\nIf there has arisen a demand for a second edition of this rather\ndifficult book before the end of the first decade, I owe no gratitude\nto the interest of the professional circles to whom I appealed in the\npreceding sentences. My colleagues in psychiatry, apparently, have\nmade no effort to shake off the first surprise which my new conception\nof the dream evoked, and the professional philosophers, who are\naccustomed to treat the problem of dream life as a part of the states\nof consciousness, devoting to it a few\u2014for the most part\nidentical\u2014sentences, have apparently failed to observe that in this\nfield could be found all kinds of things which would inevitably lead\nto a thorough transformation of our psychological theories. The\nbehaviour of the scientific critics could only justify the expectation\nthat this work of mine was destined to be buried in oblivion; and the\nsmall troop of brave pupils who follow my leadership in the medical\napplication of psychoanalysis, and also follow my example in analysing\ndreams in order to utilise these analyses in the treatment of\nneurotics, would not have exhausted the first edition of the book. I\ntherefore feel indebted to that wider circle of intelligent seekers\nafter truth whose co-operation has procured for me the invitation to\ntake up anew, after nine years, the difficult and in so many respects\nfundamental work.\nI am glad to be able to say that I have found little to change. Here and\nthere I have inserted new material, added new views from my wider\nexperience, and attempted to revise certain points; but everything\nessential concerning the dream and its interpretation, as well as the\npsychological propositions derived from it, has remained unchanged: at\nleast, subjectively, it has stood the test of time. Those who are\nacquainted with my other works on the Etiology and Mechanism of the\npsychoneuroses, know that I have never offered anything unfinished as\nfinished, and that I have always striven to change my assertions in\naccordance with my advancing views; but in the realm of the dream life I\nhave been able to stand by my first declarations. During the long years\nof my work on the problems of the neuroses, I have been repeatedly\nconfronted with doubts, and have often made mistakes; but it was always\nin the \u201cinterpretation of dreams\u201d that I found my bearings. My numerous\nscientific opponents, therefore, show an especially sure instinct when\nthey refuse to follow me into this territory of dream investigation.\nLikewise, the material used in this book to illustrate the rules of\ndream interpretation, drawn chiefly from dreams of my own which have\nbeen depreciated and outstripped by events, have in the revision shown a\npersistence which resisted substantial changes. For me, indeed, the book\nhas still another subjective meaning which I could comprehend only after\nit had been completed. It proved to be for me a part of my\nself-analysis, a reaction to the death of my father\u2014that is, to the most\nsignificant event, the deepest loss, in the life of a man. After I\nrecognised this I felt powerless to efface the traces of this influence.\nFor the reader, however, it makes no difference from what material he\nlearns to value and interpret dreams.\nBERCHTESGADEN, Summer of 1908.\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\nWhereas a period of nine years elapsed between the first and second\neditions of this book, the need for a third edition has appeared after\nlittle more than a year. I have reason to be pleased with this change;\nbut, just as I have not considered the earlier neglect of my work on the\npart of the reader as a proof of its unworthiness, I am unable to find\nin the interest manifested at present a proof of its excellence.\nThe progress in scientific knowledge has shown its influence on the\n_Interpretation of Dreams_. When I wrote it in 1899 the \u201cSexual\nTheories\u201d was not yet in existence, and the analysis of complicated\nforms of psychoneuroses was still in its infancy. The interpretation of\ndreams was destined to aid in the psychological analysis of the\nneuroses, but since then the deeper understanding of the neuroses has\nreacted on our conception of the dream. The study of dream\ninterpretation itself has continued to develop in a direction upon which\nnot enough stress was laid in the first edition of this book. From my\nown experience, as well as from the works of W. Stekel and others, I\nhave since learned to attach a greater value to the extent and the\nsignificance of symbolism in dreams (or rather in the unconscious\nthinking). Thus much has accumulated in the course of this year which\nrequires consideration. I have endeavoured to do justice to this new\nmaterial by numerous insertions in the text and by the addition of\nfootnotes. If these supplements occasionally threaten to warp the\noriginal discussion, or if, even with their aid, we have been\nunsuccessful in raising the original text to the _niveau_ of our present\nviews, I must beg indulgence for the gaps in the book, as they are only\nconsequences and indications of the present rapid development of our\nknowledge. I also venture to foretell in what other directions later\neditions of the _Interpretation of Dreams_\u2014in case any should be\ndemanded\u2014will differ from the present one. They will have, on the one\nhand, to include selections from the rich material of poetry, myth,\nusage of language, and folk-lore, and, on the other hand, to treat more\nprofoundly the relations of the dream to the neuroses and to mental\ndiseases.\nMr. Otto Rank has rendered me valuable service in the selection of the\naddenda and in reading the proof sheets. I am gratefully indebted to him\nand to many others for their contributions and corrections.\nVIENNA, Spring of 1911.\nTRANSLATOR\u2019S PREFACE\nSince the appearance of the author\u2019s _Selected Papers on Hysteria and\nother Psychoneuroses_, and _Three Contributions to the Sexual\nTheory_,[A] much has been said and written about Freud\u2019s works. Some of\nour readers have made an honest endeavour to test and utilise the\nauthor\u2019s theories, but they have been handicapped by their inability to\nread fluently very difficult German, for only two of Freud\u2019s works have\nhitherto been accessible to English readers. For them this work will be\nof invaluable assistance. To be sure, numerous articles on the Freudian\npsychology have of late made their appearance in our literature;[B] but\nthese scattered papers, read by those unacquainted with the original\nwork, often serve to confuse rather than enlighten. For Freud cannot be\nmastered from the reading of a few pamphlets, or even one or two of his\noriginal works. Let me repeat what I have so often said: No one is\nreally qualified to use or to judge Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic method who\nhas not thoroughly mastered his theory of the neuroses\u2014_The\nInterpretation of Dreams_, _Three Contributions to the Sexual Theory_,\n_The Psychopathology of Everyday Life_, and _Wit and its Relation to the\nUnconscious_, and who has not had considerable experience in analysing\nthe dreams and psychopathological actions of himself and others. That\nthere is required also a thorough training in normal and abnormal\npsychology goes without saying.\n_The Interpretation of Dreams_ is the author\u2019s greatest and most\nimportant work; it is here that he develops his psychoanalytic\ntechnique, a thorough knowledge of which is absolutely indispensable for\nevery worker in this field. The difficult task of making a translation\nof this work has, therefore, been undertaken primarily for the purpose\nof assisting those who are actively engaged in treating patients by\nFreud\u2019s psychoanalytic method. Considered apart from its practical aim,\nthe book presents much that is of interest to the psychologist and the\ngeneral reader. For, notwithstanding the fact that dreams have of late\nyears been the subject of investigation at the hands of many competent\nobservers, only few have contributed anything tangible towards their\nsolution; it was Freud who divested the dream of its mystery, and solved\nits riddles. He not only showed us that the dream is full of meaning,\nbut amply demonstrated that it is intimately connected with normal and\nabnormal mental life. It is in the treatment of the abnormal mental\nstates that we must recognise the most important value of dream\ninterpretation. The dream does not only reveal to us the cryptic\nmechanisms of hallucinations, delusions, phobias, obsessions, and other\npsychopathological conditions, but it is also the most potent instrument\nin the removal of these.[C]\nI take this opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to Professor F. C.\nPrescott for reading the manuscript and for helping me overcome the\nalmost insurmountable difficulties in the translation.\nA. A.

I shall furthermore\nendeavour to explain the processes which give rise to the strangeness\nand obscurity of the dream, and to discover through them the nature of\nthe psychic forces which operate, whether in combination or in\nopposition, to produce the dream. This accomplished, my investigation\nwill terminate, as it will have reached the point where the problem of\nthe dream meets with broader problems, the solution of which must be\nattempted through other material.\nI must presuppose that the reader is acquainted with the work done by\nearlier authors as well as with the present status of the dream problem\nin science, since in the course of this treatise I shall not often have\noccasion to return to them. For, notwithstanding the effort of several\nthousand years, little progress has been made in the scientific\nunderstanding of dreams. This has been so universally acknowledged by\nthe authors that it seems unnecessary to quote individual opinions. One\nwill find in the writings indexed at the end of this book many\nstimulating observations and plenty of interesting material for our\nsubject, but little or nothing that concerns the true nature of the\ndream or that solves definitively any of its enigmas. Still less of\ncourse has been transmitted to the knowledge of the educated laity.\nThe first book in which the dream is treated as an object of psychology\nseems to be that of Aristotle[1] (_Concerning Dreams and their\nInterpretation_). Aristotle asserts that the dream is of demoniacal,\nthough not of divine nature, which indeed contains deep meaning, if it\nbe correctly interpreted. He was also acquainted with some of the\ncharacteristics of dream life, _e.g._, he knew that the dream turns\nslight sensations perceived during sleep into great ones (\u201cone imagines\nthat one walks through fire and feels hot, if this or that part of the\nbody becomes slightly warmed\u201d), which led him to conclude that dreams\nmight easily betray to the physician the first indications of an\nincipient change in the body passing unnoticed during the day. I have\nbeen unable to go more deeply into the Aristotelian treatise, because of\ninsufficient preparation and lack of skilled assistance.\nAs every one knows, the ancients before Aristotle did not consider the\ndream a product of the dreaming mind, but a divine inspiration, and in\nancient times the two antagonistic streams, which one finds throughout\nin the estimates of dream life, were already noticeable. They\ndistinguished between true and valuable dreams, sent to the dreamer to\nwarn him or to foretell the future, and vain, fraudulent, and empty\ndreams, the object of which was to misguide or lead him to\ndestruction.[E] This pre-scientific conception of the dream among the\nancients was certainly in perfect keeping with their general view of\nlife, which was wont to project as reality in the outer world that which\npossessed reality only within the mind. It, moreover, accounted for the\nmain impression made upon the waking life by the memory left from the\ndream in the morning, for in this memory the dream, as compared with the\nrest of the psychic content, seems something strange, coming, as it\nwere, from another world. It would likewise be wrong to suppose that the\ntheory of the supernatural origin of dreams lacks followers in our own\nday; for leaving out of consideration all bigoted and mystical\nauthors\u2014who are perfectly justified in adhering to the remnants of the\nonce extensive realm of the supernatural until they have been swept away\nby scientific explanation\u2014one meets even sagacious men averse to\nanything adventurous, who go so far as to base their religious belief in\nthe existence and co-operation of superhuman forces on the\ninexplicableness of the dream manifestations (Haffner[32]). The validity\nascribed to the dream life by some schools of philosophy, _e.g._ the\nschool of Schelling, is a distinct echo of the undisputed divinity of\ndreams in antiquity, nor is discussion closed on the subject of the\nmantic or prophetic power of dreams. This is due to the fact that the\nattempted psychological explanations are too inadequate to overcome the\naccumulated material, however strongly all those who devote themselves\nto a scientific mode of thought may feel that such assertions should be\nrepudiated.\nTo write a history of our scientific knowledge of dream problems is so\ndifficult because, however valuable some parts of this knowledge may\nhave been, no progress in definite directions has been discernible.\nThere has been no construction of a foundation of assured results upon\nwhich future investigators could continue to build, but every new author\ntakes up the same problems afresh and from the very beginning. Were I to\nfollow the authors in chronological order, and give a review of the\nopinions each has held concerning the problems of the dream, I should be\nprevented from drawing a clear and complete picture of the present state\nof knowledge on the subject. I have therefore preferred to base the\ntreatment upon themes rather than upon the authors, and I shall cite for\neach problem of the dream the material found in the literature for its\nsolution.\nBut as I have not succeeded in mastering the entire literature, which is\nwidely disseminated and interwoven with that on other subjects, I must\nask my readers to rest content provided no fundamental fact or important\nviewpoint be lost in my description.\nUntil recently most authors have been led to treat the subjects of sleep\nand dream in the same connection, and with them they have also regularly\ntreated analogous states of psychopathology, and other dreamlike states\nlike hallucinations, visions, &c. In the more recent works, on the other\nhand, there has been a tendency to keep more closely to the theme, and\nto take as the subject one single question of the dream life. This\nchange, I believe, is an expression of the conviction that enlightenment\nand agreement in such obscure matters can only be brought about by a\nseries of detailed investigations. It is such a detailed investigation\nand one of a special psychological nature, that I would offer here. I\nhave little occasion to study the problem of sleep, as it is essentially\na psychological problem, although the change of functional\ndeterminations for the mental apparatus must be included in the\ncharacter of sleep. The literature of sleep will therefore not be\nconsidered here.\nA scientific interest in the phenomena of dreams as such leads to the\nfollowing in part interdependent inquiries:\n(_a_) _The Relation of the Dream to the Waking State._\u2014The na\u00efve\njudgment of a person on awakening assumes that the dream\u2014if indeed it\ndoes not originate in another world\u2014at any rate has taken the dreamer\ninto another world. The old physiologist, Burdach,[8] to whom we are\nindebted for a careful and discriminating description of the phenomena\nof dreams, expressed this conviction in an often-quoted passage, p. 474:\n\u201cThe waking life never repeats itself with its trials and joys, its\npleasures and pains, but, on the contrary, the dream aims to relieve us\nof these. Even when our whole mind is filled with one subject, when\nprofound sorrow has torn our hearts or when a task has claimed the whole\npower of our mentality, the dream either gives us something entirely\nstrange, or it takes for its combinations only a few elements from\nreality, or it only enters into the strain of our mood and symbolises\nreality.\u201d\nL. Str\u00fcmpell[66] expresses himself to the same effect in his _Nature and\nOrigin of Dreams_ (p. 16), a study which is everywhere justly held in\nhigh respect: \u201cHe who dreams turns his back upon the world of waking\nconsciousness\u201d (p. 17). \u201cIn the dream the memory of the orderly content\nof the waking consciousness and its normal behaviour is as good as\nentirely lost\u201d (p. 19). \u201cThe almost complete isolation of the mind in\nthe dream from the regular normal content and course of the waking\nstate....\u201d\nBut the overwhelming majority of the authors have assumed a contrary\nview of the relation of the dream to waking life. Thus Haffner[32] (p.\n19): \u201cFirst of all the dream is the continuation of the waking state.\nOur dreams always unite themselves with those ideas which have shortly\nbefore been in our consciousness. Careful examination will nearly always\nfind a thread by which the dream has connected itself with the\nexperience of the previous day.\u201d Weygandt[75] (p. 6), flatly contradicts\nthe above cited statement of Burdach: \u201cFor it may often be observed,\napparently in the great majority of dreams, that they lead us directly\nback into everyday life, instead of releasing us from it.\u201d Maury[48] (p.\n56), says in a concise formula: \u201cNous r\u00eavons de ce que nous avons vu,\ndit, d\u00e9sir\u00e9 ou fait.\u201d Jessen,[36] in his _Psychology_, published in 1855\n(p. 530), is somewhat more explicit: \u201cThe content of dreams is more or\nless determined by the individual personality, by age, sex, station in\nlife, education, habits, and by events and experiences of the whole past\nlife.\u201d\nThe ancients had the same idea about the dependence of the dream content\nupon life. I cite Radestock[54] (p. 139): \u201cWhen Xerxes, before his march\nagainst Greece, was dissuaded from this resolution by good counsel, but\nwas again and again incited by dreams to undertake it, one of the old\nrational dream-interpreters of the Persians, Artabanus, told him very\nappropriately that dream pictures mostly contain that of which one has\nbeen thinking while awake.\u201d\nIn the didactic poem of Lucretius, _De Rerum Natura_ (IV, v. 959),\noccurs this passage:\u2014\n\u201cEt quo quisque fere studio devinctus adhaeret,\naut quibus in rebus multum sumus ante morati\natque in ea ratione fuit contenta magis mens,\nin somnis eadem plerumque videmur obire;\ncausidici causas agere et componere leges,\ninduperatores pugnare ac proelia obire,\u201d &c., &c.\nCicero (_De Divinatione_, II) says quite similarly, as does also Maury\nmuch later:\u2014\n\u201cMaximeque reliquiae earum rerum moventur in animis et agitantur, de\nquibus vigilantes aut cogitavimus aut egimus.\u201d\nThe contradiction expressed in these two views as to the relation\nbetween dream life and waking life seems indeed insoluble. It will\ntherefore not be out of place to mention the description of F. W.\nHildebrandt[35] (1875), who believes that the peculiarities of the dream\ncan generally be described only by calling them a \u201cseries of contrasts\nwhich apparently shade off into contradictions\u201d (p. 8). \u201cThe first of\nthese contrasts is formed on the one hand by the strict isolation or\nseclusion of the dream from true and actual life, and on the other hand\nby the continuous encroachment of the one upon the other, and the\nconstant dependency of one upon the other. The dream is something\nabsolutely separated from the reality experienced during the waking\nstate; one may call it an existence hermetically sealed up and separated\nfrom real life by an unsurmountable chasm. It frees us from reality,\nextinguishes normal recollection of reality, and places us in another\nworld and in a totally different life, which at bottom has nothing in\ncommon with reality....\u201d Hildebrandt then asserts that in falling asleep\nour whole being, with all its forms of existence, disappears \u201cas through\nan invisible trap door.\u201d In the dream one is perhaps making a voyage to\nSt. Helena in order to offer the imprisoned Napoleon something exquisite\nin the way of Moselle wine. One is most amicably received by the\nex-emperor, and feels almost sorry when the interesting illusion is\ndestroyed on awakening. But let us now compare the situation of the\ndream with reality. The dreamer has never been a wine merchant, and has\nno desire to become one. He has never made a sea voyage, and St. Helena\nis the last place he would take as destination for such a voyage. The\ndreamer entertains no sympathetic feeling for Napoleon, but on the\ncontrary a strong patriotic hatred. And finally the dreamer was not yet\namong the living when Napoleon died on the island; so that it was beyond\nthe reach of possibility for him to have had any personal relations with\nNapoleon. The dream experience thus appears as something strange,\ninserted between two perfectly harmonising and succeeding periods.\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d continues Hildebrandt, \u201cthe opposite is seemingly just\nas true and correct. I believe that hand in hand with this seclusion and\nisolation there can still exist the most intimate relation and\nconnection. We may justly say that no matter what the dream offers, it\nfinds its material in reality and in the psychic life arrayed around\nthis reality. However strange the dream may seem, it can never detach\nitself from reality, and its most sublime as well as its most farcical\nstructures must always borrow their elementary material either from what\nwe have seen with our eyes in the outer world, or from what has\npreviously found a place somewhere in our waking thoughts; in other\nwords, it must be taken from what we had already experienced either\nobjectively or subjectively.\u201d\n(_b_) _The Material of the Dream.\u2014Memory in the Dream._\u2014That all the\nmaterial composing the content of the dream in some way originates in\nexperience, that it is reproduced in the dream, or recalled,\u2014this at\nleast may be taken as an indisputable truth. Yet it would be wrong to\nassume that such connection between dream content and reality will be\nreadily disclosed as an obvious product of the instituted comparison. On\nthe contrary, the connection must be carefully sought, and in many cases\nit succeeds in eluding discovery for a long time. The reason for this is\nto be found in a number of peculiarities evinced by the memory in\ndreams, which, though universally known, have hitherto entirely eluded\nexplanation. It will be worth while to investigate exhaustively these\ncharacteristics.\nIt often happens that matter appears in the dream content which one\ncannot recognise later in the waking state as belonging to one\u2019s\nknowledge and experience. One remembers well enough having dreamed about\nthe subject in question, but cannot recall the fact or time of the\nexperience. The dreamer is therefore in the dark as to the source from\nwhich the dream has been drawing, and is even tempted to believe an\nindependently productive activity on the part of the dream, until, often\nlong afterwards, a new episode brings back to recollection a former\nexperience given up as lost, and thus reveals the source of the dream.\nOne is thus forced to admit that something has been known and remembered\nin the dream that has been withdrawn from memory during the waking\nstate.\nDelb\u0153uf[16] narrates from his own experience an especially impressive\nexample of this kind. He saw in his dream the courtyard of his house\ncovered with snow, and found two little lizards half-frozen and buried\nin the snow. Being a lover of animals, he picked them up, warmed them,\nand put them back into a crevice in the wall which was reserved for\nthem. He also gave them some small fern leaves that had been growing on\nthe wall, which he knew they were fond of. In the dream he knew the name\nof the plant: _Asplenium ruta muralis_. The dream then continued,\nreturning after a digression to the lizards, and to his astonishment\nDelb\u0153uf saw two other little animals falling upon what was left of the\nferns. On turning his eyes to the open field he saw a fifth and a sixth\nlizard running into the hole in the wall, and finally the street was\ncovered with a procession of lizards, all wandering in the same\ndirection, &c.\nIn his waking state Delb\u0153uf knew only a few Latin names of plants, and\nnothing of the Asplenium. To his great surprise he became convinced that\na fern of this name really existed and that the correct name was\n_Asplenium ruta muraria_, which the dream had slightly disfigured. An\naccidental coincidence could hardly be considered, but it remained a\nmystery for Delb\u0153uf whence he got his knowledge of the name Asplenium in\nthe dream.\nThe dream occurred in 1862. Sixteen years later, while at the house of\none of his friends, the philosopher noticed a small album containing\ndried plants resembling the albums that are sold as souvenirs to\nvisitors in many parts of Switzerland. A sudden recollection occurred to\nhim; he opened the herbarium, and discovered therein the Asplenium of\nhis dream, and recognised his own handwriting in the accompanying Latin\nname. The connection could now be traced. While on her wedding trip, a\nsister of this friend visited Delb\u0153uf in 1860\u2014two years prior to the\nlizard dream. She had with her at the time this album, which was\nintended for her brother, and Delb\u0153uf took the trouble to write, at the\ndictation of a botanist, under each of the dried plants the Latin name.\nThe favourable accident which made possible the report of this valuable\nexample also permitted Delb\u0153uf to trace another portion of this dream to\nits forgotten source. One day in 1877 he came upon an old volume of an\nillustrated journal, in which he found pictured the whole procession of\nlizards just as he had dreamed it in 1862. The volume bore the date of\n1861, and Delb\u0153uf could recall that he had subscribed to the journal\nfrom its first appearance.\nThat the dream has at its disposal recollections which are inaccessible\nto the waking state is such a remarkable and theoretically important\nfact that I should like to urge more attention to it by reporting\nseveral other \u201cHypermnesic Dreams.\u201d Maury[48] relates that for some time\nthe word Mussidan used to occur to his mind during the day. He knew it\nto be the name of a French city, but nothing else. One night he dreamed\nof a conversation with a certain person who told him that she came from\nMussidan, and, in answer to his question where the city was, she\nreplied: \u201cMussidan is a principal country town in the D\u00e9partement de La\nDordogne.\u201d On waking, Maury put no faith in the information received in\nhis dream; the geographical lexicon, however, showed it to be perfectly\ncorrect. In this case the superior knowledge of the dream is confirmed,\nbut the forgotten source of this knowledge has not been traced.\nJessen[36] tells (p. 55) of a quite similar dream occurrence, from more\nremote times. Among others we may here mention the dream of the elder\nScaliger (Hennings, _l.c._, p. 300), who wrote a poem in praise of\ncelebrated men of Verona, and to whom a man, named Brugnolus, appeared\nin a dream, complaining that he had been neglected. Though Scaliger did\nnot recall ever having heard of him, he wrote some verses in his honour,\nand his son later discovered at Verona that a Brugnolus had formerly\nbeen famous there as a critic.\nMyers is said to have published a whole collection of such hypermnesic\ndreams in the _Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research_, which\nare unfortunately inaccessible to me. I believe every one who occupies\nhimself with dreams will recognise as a very common phenomenon the fact\nthat the dream gives proof of knowing and recollecting matters unknown\nto the waking person. In my psychoanalytic investigations of nervous\npatients, of which I shall speak later, I am every week more than once\nin position to convince my patients from their dreams that they are well\nacquainted with quotations, obscene expressions, &c., and that they make\nuse of these in their dreams, although they have forgotten them in the\nwaking state. I shall cite here a simple case of dream hypermnesia\nbecause it was easy to trace the source which made the knowledge\naccessible to the dream.\nA patient dreamed in a lengthy connection that he ordered a\n\u201cKontusz\u00f3wka\u201d in a caf\u00e9, and after reporting this inquired what it might\nmean, as he never heard the name before. I was able to answer that\nKontusz\u00f3wka was a Polish liquor which he could not have invented in his\ndream, as the name had long been familiar to me in advertisements. The\npatient would not at first believe me, but some days later, after he had\nrealised his dream of the caf\u00e9, he noticed the name on a signboard at\nthe street corner, which he had been obliged to pass for months at least\ntwice a day.\nI have learned from my own dreams how largely the discovery of the\norigin of some of the dream elements depends on accident. Thus, for\nyears before writing this book, I was haunted by the picture of a very\nsimply formed church tower which I could not recall having seen. I then\nsuddenly recognised it with absolute certainty at a small station\nbetween Salzburg and Reichenhall. This was in the later nineties, and I\nhad travelled over the road for the first time in the year 1886. In\nlater years, when I was already busily engaged in the study of dreams, I\nwas quite annoyed at the frequent recurrence of the dream picture of a\ncertain peculiar locality. I saw it in definite local relation to my\nperson\u2014to my left, a dark space from which many grotesque sandstone\nfigures stood out. A glimmer of recollection, which I did not quite\ncredit, told me it was the entrance to a beer-cellar, but I could\nexplain neither the meaning nor the origin of this dream picture. In\n1907 I came by chance to Padua, which, to my regret, I had been unable\nto visit since 1895. My first visit to this beautiful university city\nwas unsatisfactory; I was unable to see Giotto\u2019s frescoes in the church\nof the Madonna dell\u2019 Arena, and on my way there turned back on being\ninformed that the little church was closed on the day. On my second\nvisit, twelve years later, I thought of compensating myself for this,\nand before everything else I started out for Madonna dell\u2019 Arena. On the\nstreet leading to it, on my left, probably at the place where I had\nturned in 1895, I discovered the locality which I had so often seen in\nthe dream, with its sandstone figures. It was in fact the entrance to a\nrestaurant garden.\nOne of the sources from which the dream draws material for\nreproduction\u2014material which in part is not recalled or employed in\nwaking thought\u2014is to be found in childhood. I shall merely cite some of\nthe authors who have observed and emphasized this.\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 23): \u201cIt has already been expressly admitted that\nthe dream sometimes brings back to the mind with wonderful reproductive\nability remote and even forgotten experiences from the earliest\nperiods.\u201d\nStr\u00fcmpell[66] (p. 40): \u201cThe subject becomes more interesting when we\nremember how the dream sometimes brings forth, as it were, from among\nthe deepest and heaviest strata which later years have piled upon the\nearliest childhood experiences, the pictures of certain places, things,\nand persons, quite uninjured and with their original freshness. This is\nnot limited merely to such impressions as have gained vivid\nconsciousness during their origin or have become impressed with strong\npsychic validity, and then later return in the dream as actual\nreminiscences, causing pleasure to the awakened consciousness. On the\ncontrary, the depths of the dream memory comprise also such pictures of\npersons, things, places, and early experiences as either possessed but\nlittle consciousness and no psychic value at all, or have long ago lost\nboth, and therefore appear totally strange and unknown both in the dream\nand in the waking state, until their former origin is revealed.\u201d\nVolkelt[72] (p. 119): \u201cIt is essentially noteworthy how easily infantile\nand youthful reminiscences enter into the dream. What we have long\nceased to think about, what has long since lost for us all importance,\nis constantly recalled by the dream.\u201d\nThe sway of the dream over the infantile material, which, as is well\nknown, mostly occupies the gaps in the conscious memory, causes the\norigin of interesting hypermnestic dreams, a few of which I shall here\nreport.\nMaury[48] relates (p. 92) that as a child he often went from his native\ncity, Meaux, to the neighbouring Trilport, where his father\nsuperintended the construction of a bridge. On a certain night a dream\ntransported him to Trilport, and he was again playing in the city\nstreets. A man approached him wearing some sort of uniform. Maury asked\nhim his name, and he introduced himself, saying that his name was C\u2014\u2014,\nand that he was a bridge guard. On waking, Maury, who still doubted the\nreality of the reminiscence, asked his old servant, who had been with\nhim in his childhood, whether she remembered a man of this name.\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d was the answer, \u201che used to be watchman on the bridge which\nyour father was building at that time.\u201d\nMaury reports another example demonstrating just as nicely the\nreliability of infantile reminiscences appearing in dreams. Mr. F\u2014\u2014, who\nhad lived as a child in Montbrison, decided to visit his home and old\nfriends of his family after an absence of twenty-five years. The night\nbefore his departure he dreamt that he had reached his destination, and\nthat he met near Montbrison a man, whom he did not know by sight, who\ntold him he was Mr. F., a friend of his father. The dreamer remembered\nthat as a child he had known a gentleman of this name, but on waking he\ncould no longer recall his features. Several days later, having really\narrived at Montbrison, he found the supposedly unknown locality of his\ndream, and there met a man whom he at once recognised as the Mr. F. of\nhis dream. The real person was only older than the one in the dream\npicture.\nI may here relate one of my own dreams in which the remembered\nimpression is replaced by an association. In my dream I saw a person\nwhom I recognised, while dreaming, as the physician of my native town.\nThe features were indistinct and confused with the picture of one of my\ncolleague teachers, whom I still see occasionally. What association\nthere was between the two persons I could not discover on awakening. But\nupon questioning my mother about the physician of my early childhood, I\ndiscovered that he was a one-eyed man. My teacher, whose figure\nconcealed that of the physician in the dream, was also one-eyed. I have\nnot seen the physician for thirty-eight years, and I have not to my\nknowledge thought of him in my waking state, although a scar on my chin\nmight have reminded me of his help.\nAs if to counterbalance the immense r\u00f4le ascribed to the infantile\nimpressions in the dream, many authors assert that the majority of\ndreams show elements from the most recent time. Thus Robert[55] (p. 46)\ndeclares that the normal dream generally occupies itself only with the\nimpressions of the recent days. We learn indeed that the theory of the\ndream advanced by Robert imperatively demands that the old impressions\nshould be pushed back, and the recent ones brought to the front.\nNevertheless the fact claimed by Robert really exists; I can confirm\nthis from my own investigations. Nelson,[50] an American author, thinks\nthat the impressions most frequently found in the dream date from two or\nthree days before, as if the impressions of the day immediately\npreceding the dream were not sufficiently weakened and remote.\nMany authors who are convinced of the intimate connection between the\ndream content and the waking state are impressed by the fact that\nimpressions which have intensely occupied the waking mind appear in the\ndream only after they have been to some extent pushed aside from the\nelaboration of the waking thought. Thus, as a rule, we do not dream of a\ndead beloved person while we are still overwhelmed with sorrow. Still\nMiss Hallam,[33] one of the latest observers, has collected examples\nshowing the very opposite behaviour, and claims for the point the right\nof individual psychology.\nThe third and the most remarkable and incomprehensible peculiarity of\nthe memory in dreams, is shown in the selection of the reproduced\nmaterial, for stress is laid not only on the most significant, but also\non the most indifferent and superficial reminiscences. On this point I\nshall quote those authors who have expressed their surprise in the most\nemphatic manner.\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 11): \u201cFor it is a remarkable fact that dreams do\nnot, as a rule, take their elements from great and deep-rooted events or\nfrom the powerful and urgent interests of the preceding day, but from\nunimportant matters, from the most worthless fragments of recent\nexperience or of a more remote past. The most shocking death in our\nfamily, the impressions of which keep us awake long into the night,\nbecomes obliterated from our memories, until the first moment of\nawakening brings it back to us with depressing force. On the other hand,\nthe wart on the forehead of a passing stranger, of whom we did not think\nfor a second after he was out of sight, plays its part in our dreams.\u201d\nStr\u00fcmpell[66] (p. 39): \u201c... such cases where the analysis of a dream\nbrings to light elements which, although derived from events of the\nprevious day or the day before the last, yet prove to be so unimportant\nand worthless for the waking state that they merge into forgetfulness\nshortly after coming to light. Such occurrences may be statements of\nothers heard accidentally or actions superficially observed, or fleeting\nperceptions of things or persons, or single phrases from books, &c.\u201d\nHavelock Ellis[23] (p. 727): \u201cThe profound emotions of waking life, the\nquestions and problems on which we spread our chief voluntary mental\nenergy, are not those which usually present themselves at once to\ndream-consciousness. It is, so far as the immediate past is concerned,\nmostly the trifling, the incidental, the \u201cforgotten\u201d impressions of\ndaily life which reappear in our dreams. The psychic activities that are\nawake most intensely are those that sleep most profoundly.\u201d\nBinz[4] (p. 45) takes occasion from the above-mentioned characteristics\nof the memory in dreams to express his dissatisfaction with explanations\nof dreams which he himself has approved of: \u201cAnd the normal dream raises\nsimilar questions. Why do we not always dream of memory impressions from\nthe preceding days, instead of going back to the almost forgotten past\nlying far behind us without any perceptible reason? Why in a dream does\nconsciousness so often revive the impression of indifferent memory\npictures while the cerebral cells bearing the most sensitive records of\nexperience remain for the most part inert and numb, unless an acute\nrevival during the waking state has shortly before excited them?\u201d\nWe can readily understand how the strange preference of the dream memory\nfor the indifferent and hence the unnoticed details of daily experience\nmust usually lead us to overlook altogether the dependence of the dream\non the waking state, or at least make it difficult to prove this\ndependence in any individual case. It thus happened that in the\nstatistical treatment of her own and her friend\u2019s dreams, Miss Whiton\nCalkins[12] found 11 per cent. of the entire number that showed no\nrelation to the waking state. Hildebrandt was certainly correct in his\nassertion that all our dream pictures could be genetically explained if\nwe devoted enough time and material to the tracing of their origin. To\nbe sure, he calls this \u201ca most tedious and thankless job.\u201d For it would\nat most lead us to ferret out all kinds of quite worthless psychic\nmaterial from the most remote corners of the memory chamber, and to\nbring to light some very indifferent moments from the remote past which\nwere perhaps buried the next hour after their appearance. I must,\nhowever, express my regret that this discerning author refrained from\nfollowing the road whose beginning looked so unpromising; it would have\nled him directly to the centre of the dream problem.\nThe behaviour of the memory in dreams is surely most significant for\nevery theory of memory in general. It teaches us that \u201cnothing which we\nhave once psychically possessed is ever entirely lost\u201d (Scholz[59]); or\nas Delb\u0153uf puts it, \u201cque toute impression m\u00eame la plus insignifiante,\nlaisse une trace inalt\u00e9rable, ind\u00e9finiment susceptible de repara\u00eetre au\njour,\u201d a conclusion to which we are urged by so many of the other\npathological manifestations of the psychic life. Let us now bear in mind\nthis extraordinary capability of the memory in the dream, in order to\nperceive vividly the contradictions which must be advanced in certain\ndream theories to be mentioned later, when they endeavour to explain the\nabsurdities and incoherence of dreams through a partial forgetting of\nwhat we have known during the day.\nOne might even think of reducing the phenomenon of dreaming to that of\nmemory, and of regarding the dream as the manifestation of an activity\nof reproduction which does not rest even at night, and which is an end\nin itself. Views like those expressed by Pilcz[51] would corroborate\nthis, according to which intimate relations are demonstrable between the\ntime of dreaming and the contents of the dream from the fact that the\nimpressions reproduced by the dream in sound sleep belong to the\nremotest past while those reproduced towards morning are of recent\norigin. But such a conception is rendered improbable from the outset by\nthe manner of the dream\u2019s behaviour towards the material to be\nremembered. Str\u00fcmpell[66] justly calls our attention to the fact that\nrepetitions of experiences do not occur in the dream. To be sure the\ndream makes an effort in that direction, but the next link is wanting,\nor appears in changed form, or it is replaced by something entirely\nnovel. The dream shows only fragments of reproduction; this is so often\nthe rule that it admits of theoretical application. Still there are\nexceptions in which the dream repeats an episode as thoroughly as our\nmemory would in its waking state. Delb\u0153uf tells of one of his university\ncolleagues who in his dream repeated, with all its details, a dangerous\nwagon ride in which he escaped accident as if by miracle. Miss\nCalkins[12] mentions two dreams, the contents of which exactly\nreproduced incidents from the day before, and I shall later take\noccasion to report an example which came to my notice, showing a\nchildish experience which returned unchanged in a dream.[F]\n(_c_) _Dream Stimuli and Dream Sources._\u2014What is meant by dream stimuli\nand dream sources may be explained by referring to the popular saying,\n\u201cDreams come from the stomach.\u201d This notion conceals a theory which\nconceives the dream as a result of a disturbance of sleep. We should not\nhave dreamed if some disturbing element had not arisen in sleep, and the\ndream is the reaction from this disturbance.\nThe discussion of the exciting causes of dreams takes up the most space\nin the descriptions of the authors. That this problem could appear only\nafter the dream had become an object of biological investigation is\nself-evident. The ancients who conceived the dream as a divine\ninspiration had no need of looking for its exciting source; to them the\ndream resulted from the will of the divine or demoniacal powers, and its\ncontent was the product of their knowledge or intention. Science,\nhowever, soon raised the question whether the stimulus to the dream is\nalways the same, or whether it might be manifold, and thus led to the\nquestion whether the causal explanation of the dream belongs to\npsychology or rather to physiology. Most authors seem to assume that the\ncauses of the disturbance of sleep, and hence the sources of the dream,\nmight be of various natures, and that physical as well as mental\nirritations might assume the r\u00f4le of dream inciters. Opinions differ\ngreatly in preferring this or that one of the dream sources, in ranking\nthem, and indeed as to their importance for the origin of dreams.\nWherever the enumeration of dream sources is complete we ultimately find\nfour forms, which are also utilised for the division of dreams:\u2014\nI. External (objective) sensory stimuli.\nII. Internal (subjective) sensory stimuli.\nIII. Internal (organic) physical excitations.\nIV. Purely psychical exciting sources.\nI. _The External Sensory Stimuli._\u2014The younger Str\u00fcmpell, son of the\nphilosopher whose writings on the subject have already more than once\nserved us as a guide in the problem of dreams, has, as is well known,\nreported his observations on a patient who was afflicted with general\nan\u00e6sthesia of the skin and with paralysis of several of the higher\nsensory organs. This man merged into sleep when his few remaining\nsensory paths from the outer world were shut off. When we wish to sleep\nwe are wont to strive for a situation resembling the one in Str\u00fcmpell\u2019s\nexperiment. We close the most important sensory paths, the eyes, and we\nendeavour to keep away from the other senses every stimulus and every\nchange of the stimuli acting upon them. We then fall asleep, although we\nare never perfectly successful in our preparations. We can neither keep\nthe stimuli away from the sensory organs altogether, nor can we fully\nextinguish the irritability of the sensory organs. That we may at any\ntime be awakened by stronger stimuli should prove to us \u201cthat the mind\nhas remained in constant communication with the material world even\nduring sleep.\u201d The sensory stimuli which reach us during sleep may\neasily become the source of dreams.\nThere are a great many stimuli of such nature, ranging from those that\nare unavoidable, being brought on by the sleeping state or at least\noccasionally induced by it, to the accidental waking stimuli which are\nadapted or calculated to put an end to sleep. Thus a strong light may\nforce itself into the eyes, a noise may become perceptible, or some\nodoriferous matter may irritate the mucous membrane of the nose. In the\nspontaneous movements of sleep we may lay bare parts of the body and\nthus expose them to a sensation of cold, or through change of position\nwe may produce sensations of pressure and touch. A fly may bite us, or a\nslight accident at night may simultaneously attack more than one sense.\nObservers have called attention to a whole series of dreams in which the\nstimulus verified on waking, and a part of the dream content\ncorresponded to such a degree that the stimulus could be recognised as\nthe source of the dream.\nI shall here cite a number of such dreams collected by Jessen[36] (p.\n527), traceable to more or less accidental objective sensory stimuli.\n\u201cEvery indistinctly perceived noise gives rise to corresponding dream\npictures; the rolling of thunder takes us into the thick of battle, the\ncrowing of a cock may be transformed into human shrieks of terror, and\nthe creaking of a door may conjure up dreams of burglars breaking into\nthe house. When one of our blankets slips off at night we may dream that\nwe are walking about naked or falling into the water. If we lie\ndiagonally across the bed with our feet extending beyond the edge, we\nmay dream of standing on the brink of a terrifying precipice, or of\nfalling from a steep height. Should our head accidentally get under the\npillow we may then imagine a big rock hanging over us and about to crush\nus under its weight. Accumulation of semen produces voluptuous dreams,\nand local pain the idea of suffering ill treatment, of hostile attacks,\nor of accidental bodily injuries.\u201d\n\u201cMeier (_Versuch einer Erkl\u00e4rung des Nachtwandelns_, Halle, 1758, p.\n33), once dreamed of being assaulted by several persons who threw him\nflat on the ground and drove a stake into the ground between his big and\nsecond toes. While imagining this in his dream he suddenly awoke and\nfelt a blade of straw sticking between his toes. The same author,\naccording to Hemmings (_Von den Traumen und Nachtwandeln_, Weimar, 1784,\np. 258) dreamed on another occasion that he was being hanged when his\nshirt was pinned somewhat tight around his neck. Hauffbauer dreamed in\nhis youth of having fallen from a high wall and found upon waking that\nthe bedstead had come apart, and that he had actually fallen to the\nfloor.... Gregory relates that he once applied a hot-water bottle to his\nfeet, and dreamed of taking a trip to the summit of Mount \u00c6tna, where he\nfound the heat on the ground almost unbearable. After having applied a\nblistering plaster to his head, a second man dreamed of being scalped by\nIndians; a third, whose shirt was damp, dreamed of being dragged through\na stream. An attack of gout caused the patient to believe that he was in\nthe hands of the Inquisition, and suffering pains of torture (Macnish).\u201d\nThe argument based upon the resemblance between stimulus and dream\ncontent is reinforced if through a systematic induction of stimuli we\nsucceed in producing dreams corresponding to the stimuli. According to\nMacnish such experiments have already been made by Giron de\nBuzareingues. \u201cHe left his knee exposed and dreamed of travelling in a\nmail coach at night. He remarked in this connection that travellers\nwould well know how cold the knees become in a coach at night. Another\ntime he left the back of his head uncovered, and dreamed of taking part\nin a religious ceremony in the open air. In the country where he lived\nit was customary to keep the head always covered except on such\noccasions.\u201d\nMaury[48] reports new observations on dreams produced in himself. (A\nnumber of other attempts produced no results.)\n1. He was tickled with a feather on his lips and on the tip of his nose.\nHe dreamed of awful torture, viz. that a mask of pitch was stuck to his\nface and then forcibly torn off, taking the skin with it.\n2. Scissors were sharpened on pincers. He heard bells ringing, then\nsounds of alarm which took him back to the June days of 1848.\n3. Cologne water was put on his nose. He found himself in Cairo in the\nshop of John Maria Farina. This was followed by mad adventures which he\nwas unable to reproduce.\n4. His neck was lightly pinched. He dreamed that a blistering plaster\nwas put on him, and thought of a doctor who treated him in his\nchildhood.\n5. A hot iron was brought near his face. He dreamed that _chauffeurs_[G]\nbroke into the house and forced the occupants to give up their money by\nsticking their feet into burning coals. The Duchess of Abrant\u00e9s, whose\nsecretary he imagined himself in the dream, then entered.\n6. A drop of water was let fall on his forehead. He imagined himself in\nItaly perspiring heavily and drinking white wine of Orvieto.\n7. When a burning candle was repeatedly focussed on him through red\npaper, he dreamed of the weather, of heat, and of a storm at sea which\nhe once experienced in the English Channel.\nD\u2019Hervey,[34] Weygandt,[75] and others have made other attempts to\nproduce dreams experimentally.\nMany have observed the striking skill of the dream in interweaving into\nits structure sudden impressions from the outer world in such a manner\nas to present a gradually prepared and initiated catastrophe\n(Hildebrandt)[35]. \u201cIn former years,\u201d this author relates, \u201cI\noccasionally made use of an alarm clock in order to wake regularly at a\ncertain hour in the morning. It probably happened hundreds of times that\nthe sound of this instrument fitted into an apparently very long and\nconnected dream, as if the entire dream had been especially designed for\nit, as if it found in this sound its appropriate and logically\nindispensable point, its inevitable issue.\u201d\nI shall cite three of these alarm-clock dreams for another purpose.\nVolkelt (p. 68) relates: \u201cA composer once dreamed that he was teaching\nschool, and was just explaining something to his pupils. He had almost\nfinished when he turned to one of the boys with the question: \u2018Did you\nunderstand me?\u2019 The boy cried out like one possessed \u2018Ya.\u2019 Annoyed at\nthis, he reprimanded him for shouting. But now the entire class was\nscreaming \u2018Orya,\u2019 then \u2018Euryo,\u2019 and finally \u2018Feueryo.\u2019 He was now\naroused by an actual alarm of fire in the street.\u201d\nGarnier (_Trait\u00e9 des Facult\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00c2me_, 1865), reported by\nRadestock,[54] relates that Napoleon I., while sleeping in a carriage,\nwas awakened from a dream by an explosion which brought back to him the\ncrossing of the Tagliamento and the bombarding of the Austrians, so that\nhe started up crying, \u201cWe are undermined!\u201d\nThe following dream of Maury[48] has become celebrated. He was sick, and\nremained in bed; his mother sat beside him. He then dreamed of the reign\nof terror at the time of the Revolution. He took part in terrible scenes\nof murder, and finally he himself was summoned before the Tribunal.\nThere he saw Robespierre, Marat, Fouquier-Tinville, and all the sorry\nheroes of that cruel epoch; he had to give an account of himself, and,\nafter all sort of incidents which did not fix themselves in his memory,\nhe was sentenced to death. Accompanied by an enormous crowd, he was led\nto the place of execution. He mounted the scaffold, the executioner tied\nhim to the board, it tipped, and the knife of the guillotine fell. He\nfelt his head severed from the trunk, and awakened in terrible anxiety,\nonly to find that the top piece of the bed had fallen down, and had\nactually struck his cervical vertebra in the same manner as the knife of\na guillotine.\nThis dream gave rise to an interesting discussion introduced by Le\nLorrain[45] and Egger[20] in the _Revue Philosophique_. The question was\nwhether, and how, it was possible for the dreamer to crowd together an\namount of dream content apparently so large in the short space of time\nelapsing between the perception of the waking stimulus and the\nawakening.\nExamples of this nature make it appear that the objective stimuli during\nsleep are the most firmly established of all the dream sources; indeed,\nit is the only stimulus which plays any part in the layman\u2019s knowledge.\nIf we ask an educated person, who is, however, unacquainted with the\nliterature of dreams, how dreams originate, he is sure to answer by\nreferring to a case familiar to him in which a dream has been explained\nafter waking by a recognised objective stimulus. Scientific\ninvestigation cannot, however, stop here, but is incited to further\nresearch by the observation that the stimulus influencing the senses\nduring sleep does not appear in the dream at all in its true form, but\nis replaced by some other presentation which is in some way related to\nit. But the relation existing between the stimulus and the result of the\ndream is, according to Maury,[47] \u201cune affinit\u00e9 quelconque mais qui\nn\u2019est pas unique et exclusive\u201d (p. 72). If we read, _e.g._, three of\nHildebrandt\u2019s \u201cAlarm Clock Dreams,\u201d we will then have to inquire why the\nsame stimulus evoked so many different results, and why just these\nresults and no others.\n(P. 37). \u201cI am taking a walk on a beautiful spring morning. I saunter\nthrough the green fields to a neighbouring village, where I see the\nnatives going to church in great numbers, wearing their holiday attire\nand carrying their hymn-books under their arms. I remember that it is\nSunday, and that the morning service will soon begin. I decide to attend\nit, but as I am somewhat overheated I also decide to cool off in the\ncemetery surrounding the church. While reading the various epitaphs, I\nhear the sexton ascend the tower and see the small village bell in the\ncupola which is about to give signal for the beginning of the devotions.\nFor another short while it hangs motionless, then it begins to swing,\nand suddenly its notes resound so clearly and penetratingly that my\nsleep comes to an end. But the sound of bells comes from the alarm\nclock.\u201d\n\u201cA second combination. It is a clear day, the streets are covered with\ndeep snow. I have promised to take part in a sleigh-ride, but have had\nto wait for some time before it was announced that the sleigh is in\nfront of my house. The preparations for getting into the sleigh are now\nmade. I put on my furs and adjust my muff, and at last I am in my place.\nBut the departure is still delayed, until the reins give the impatient\nhorses the perceptible sign. They start, and the sleigh bells, now\nforcibly shaken, begin their familiar janizary music with a force that\ninstantly tears the gossamer of my dream. Again it is only the shrill\nsound of my alarm clock.\u201d\nStill a third example. \u201cI see the kitchen-maid walk along the corridor\nto the dining-room with several dozen plates piled up. The porcelain\ncolumn in her arms seems to me to be in danger of losing its\nequilibrium. \u2018Take care,\u2019 I exclaim, \u2018you will drop the whole pile.\u2019 The\nusual retort is naturally not wanting\u2014that she is used to such things.\nMeanwhile I continue to follow her with my worried glance, and behold!\nat the door-step the fragile dishes fall, tumble, and roll across the\nfloor in hundreds of pieces. But I soon notice that the noise continuing\nendlessly is not really a rattling but a true ringing, and with this\nringing the dreamer now becomes aware that the alarm clock has done its\nduty.\u201d\nThe question why the dreaming mind misjudges the nature of the objective\nsensory stimulus has been answered by Str\u00fcmpell,[66] and almost\nidentically by Wundt,[76] to the effect that the reaction of the mind to\nthe attacking stimuli in sleep is determined by the formation of\nillusions. A sensory impression is recognised by us and correctly\ninterpreted, i.e. it is classed with the memory group to which it\nbelongs according to all previous experience, if the impression is\nstrong, clear, and long enough, and if we have the necessary time at our\ndisposal for this reflection. If these conditions are not fulfilled, we\nmistake the objects which give rise to the impression, and on its basis\nwe form an illusion. \u201cIf one takes a walk in an open field and perceives\nindistinctly a distant object, it may happen that he will at first take\nit for a horse.\u201d On closer inspection the image of a cow resting may\nobtrude itself, and the presentation may finally resolve itself with\ncertainty into a group of people sitting. The impressions which the mind\nreceives during sleep through outer stimuli are of a similar indistinct\nnature; they give rise to illusions because the impression evokes a\ngreater or lesser number of memory pictures through which the impression\nreceives its psychic value. In which of the many spheres of memory to be\ntaken into consideration the corresponding pictures are aroused, and\nwhich of the possible association connections thereby come into force,\nthis, even according to Str\u00fcmpell, remains indeterminable, and is left,\nas it were, to the caprice of the psychic life.\nWe may here take our choice. We may admit that the laws of the dream\nformation cannot really be traced any further, and therefore refrain\nfrom asking whether or not the interpretation of the illusion evoked by\nthe sensory impression depends upon still other conditions; or we may\nsuppose that the objective sensory stimulus encroaching upon sleep plays\nonly a modest part as a dream source, and that other factors determine\nthe choice of the memory picture to be evoked. Indeed, on carefully\nexamining Maury\u2019s experimentally produced dreams, which I have purposely\nreported in detail, one is apt to think that the experiment really\nexplains the origin of only one of the dream elements, and that the rest\nof the dream content appears in fact too independent, too much\ndetermined in detail, to be explained by the one demand, viz. that it\nmust agree with the element experimentally introduced. Indeed one even\nbegins to doubt the illusion theory, and the power of the objective\nimpression to form the dream, when one learns that this impression at\ntimes experiences the most peculiar and far-fetched interpretations\nduring the sleeping state. Thus B. M. Simon[63] tells of a dream in\nwhich he saw persons of gigantic stature[H] seated at a table, and heard\ndistinctly the awful rattling produced by the impact of their jaws while\nchewing. On waking he heard the clacking of the hoofs of a horse\ngalloping past his window. If the noise of the horse\u2019s hoofs had\nrecalled ideas from the memory sphere of \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels,\u201d the\nsojourn with the giants of Brobdingnag and the virtuous\nhorse-creatures\u2014as I should perhaps interpret it without any assistance\non the author\u2019s part\u2014should not the choice of a memory sphere so\nuncommon for the stimulus have some further illumination from other\nmotives?\nII. _Internal (Subjective) Sensory Stimuli._\u2014Notwithstanding all\nobjections to the contrary, we must admit that the r\u00f4le of the objective\nsensory stimuli as a producer of dreams has been indisputably\nestablished, and if these stimuli seem perhaps insufficient in their\nnature and frequency to explain all dream pictures, we are then directed\nto look for other dream sources acting in an analogous manner. I do not\nknow where the idea originated that along with the outer sensory stimuli\nthe inner (subjective) stimuli should also be considered, but as a\nmatter of fact this is done more or less fully in all the more recent\ndescriptions of the etiology of dreams. \u201cAn important part is played in\ndream illusions,\u201d says Wundt[36] (p. 363), \u201cby those subjective\nsensations of seeing and hearing which are familiar to us in the waking\nstate as a luminous chaos in the dark field of vision, ringing, buzzing,\n&c., of the ears, and especially irritation of the retina. This explains\nthe remarkable tendency of the dream to delude the eyes with numbers of\nsimilar or identical objects. Thus we see spread before our eyes\nnumberless birds, butterflies, fishes, coloured beads, flowers, &c. Here\nthe luminous dust in the dark field of vision has taken on phantastic\nfigures, and the many luminous points of which it consists are embodied\nby the dream in as many single pictures, which are looked upon as moving\nobjects owing to the mobility of the luminous chaos. This is also the\nroot of the great fondness of the dream for the most complex animal\nfigures, the multiplicity of forms readily following the form of the\nsubjective light pictures.\u201d\nThe subjective sensory stimuli as a source of the dream have the obvious\nadvantage that unlike the objective stimuli they are independent of\nexternal accidents. They are, so to speak, at the disposal of the\nexplanation as often as it needs them. They are, however, in so far\ninferior to the objective sensory stimuli that the r\u00f4le of dream\ninciter, which observation and experiment have proven for the latter,\ncan be verified in their case only with difficulty or not at all. The\nmain proof for the dream-inciting power of subjective sensory\nexcitements is offered by the so-called hypnogogic hallucinations, which\nhave been described by John M\u00fcller as \u201cphantastic visual\nmanifestations.\u201d They are those very vivid and changeable pictures which\noccur regularly in many people during the period of falling asleep, and\nwhich may remain for awhile even after the eyes have been opened.\nMaury,[48] who was considerably troubled by them, subjected them to a\nthorough study, and maintained that they are related to or rather\nidentical with dream pictures\u2014this has already been asserted by John\nM\u00fcller. Maury states that a certain psychic passivity is necessary for\ntheir origin; it requires a relaxation of the tension of attention (p.\n59). But in any ordinary disposition a hypnogogic hallucination may be\nproduced by merging for a second into such lethargy, after which one\nperhaps awakens until this oft-repeated process terminates in sleep.\nAccording to Maury, if one awakens shortly thereafter, it is often\npossible to demonstrate the same pictures in the dream which one has\nperceived as hypnogogic hallucinations before falling asleep (p. 134).\nThus it once happened to Maury with a group of pictures of grotesque\nfigures, with distorted features and strange headdresses, which obtruded\nthemselves upon him with incredible importunity during the period of\nfalling asleep, and which he recalled having dreamed upon awakening. On\nanother occasion, while suffering from hunger, because he kept himself\non a rather strict diet, he saw hypnogogically a plate and a hand armed\nwith a fork taking some food from the plate. In his dream he found\nhimself at a table abundantly supplied with food, and heard the rattle\nmade by the diners with their forks. On still another occasion, after\nfalling asleep with irritated and painful eyes, he had the hypnogogic\nhallucination of seeing microscopically small characters which he was\nforced to decipher one by one with great exertion; having been awakened\nfrom his sleep an hour later, he recalled a dream in which there was an\nopen book with very small letters, which he was obliged to read through\nwith laborious effort.\nJust as in the case of these pictures, auditory hallucinations of words,\nnames, &c., may also appear hypnogogically, and then repeat themselves\nin the dream, like an overture announcing the principal motive of the\nopera which is to follow.\nA more recent observer of hypnogogic hallucinations, G. Trumbull\nLadd,[40] takes the same path pursued by John M\u00fcller and Maury. By dint\nof practice he succeeded in acquiring the faculty of suddenly arousing\nhimself, without opening his eyes, two to five minutes after having\ngradually fallen asleep, which gave him opportunity to compare the\nsensations of the retina just vanishing with the dream pictures\nremaining in his memory. He assures us that an intimate relation between\nthe two can always be recognised, in the sense that the luminous dots\nand lines of the spontaneous light of the retina produced, so to speak,\nthe sketched outline or scheme for the psychically perceived dream\nfigures. A dream, _e.g._, in which he saw in front of him clearly\nprinted lines which he read and studied, corresponded to an arrangement\nof the luminous dots and lines in the retina in parallel lines, or, to\nexpress it in his own words: \u201cThe clearly printed page, which he was\nreading in the dream, resolved itself into an object which appeared to\nhis waking perception like part of an actual printed sheet looked at\nthrough a little hole in a piece of paper, from too great a distance to\nbe made out distinctly.\u201d Without in any way under-estimating the central\npart of the phenomenon, Ladd believes that hardly any visual dream\noccurs in our minds that is not based on material furnished by this\ninner condition of stimulation in the retina. This is particularly true\nof dreams occurring shortly after falling asleep in a dark room, while\ndreams occurring in the morning near the period of awakening receive\ntheir stimulation from the objective light penetrating the eye from the\nlightened room. The shifting and endlessly variable character of the\nspontaneous luminous excitation of the retina corresponds exactly to the\nfitful succession of pictures presented to us in our dreams. If we\nattach any importance to Ladd\u2019s observations, we cannot underrate the\nproductiveness of this subjective source of excitation for the dream;\nfor visual pictures apparently form the principal constituent of our\ndreams. The share furnished from the spheres of the other senses, beside\nthe sense of hearing, is more insignificant and inconstant.\nIII. _Internal (Organic) Physical Excitation._\u2014If we are disposed to\nseek dream sources not outside, but inside, the organism, we must\nremember that almost all our internal organs, which in their healthy\nstate hardly remind us of their existence, may, in states of\nexcitation\u2014as we call them\u2014or in disease, become for us a source of the\nmost painful sensations, which must be put on an equality with the\nexternal excitants of the pain and sensory stimuli. It is on the\nstrength of very old experience that, _e.g._, Str\u00fcmpell[66] declares\nthat \u201cduring sleep the mind becomes far more deeply and broadly\nconscious of its connection with the body than in the waking state, and\nit is compelled to receive and be influenced by stimulating impressions\noriginating in parts and changes of the body of which it is unconscious\nin the waking state.\u201d Even Aristotle[1] declares it quite possible that\nthe dream should draw our attention to incipient morbid conditions which\nwe have not noticed at all in the waking state owing to the exaggeration\ngiven by the dream to the impressions; and some medical authors, who\nwere certainly far from believing in any prophetic power of the dream,\nhave admitted this significance of the dream at least for the\nforetelling of disease. (Compare M. Simon, p. 31, and many older\nauthors.)\nEven in our times there seems to be no lack of authenticated examples of\nsuch diagnostic performances on the part of the dream. Thus Tissi\u00e9[68]\ncites from Artigues (_Essai sur la Valeur s\u00e9m\u00e9iologique des R\u00e9ves_), the\nhistory of a woman of forty-three years, who, during several years of\napparently perfect health, was troubled with anxiety dreams, and in whom\nmedical examination later disclosed an incipient affection of the heart\nto which she soon succumbed.\nSerious disturbances of the internal organs apparently act as inciters\nof dreams in a considerable number of persons. Attention is quite\ngenerally called to the frequency of anxiety dreams in the diseases of\nthe heart and lungs; indeed this relation of the dream life is placed so\nconspicuously in the foreground by many authors that I shall here\ncontent myself with a mere reference to the literature. (Radestock,[54]\nSpitta,[64] Maury, M. Simon, Tissi\u00e9.) Tissi\u00e9 even assumes that the\ndiseased organs impress upon the dream content their characteristic\nfeatures. The dreams of persons suffering from diseases of the heart are\ngenerally very brief and terminate in a terrified awakening; the\nsituation of death under terrible circumstances almost always plays a\npart in their content. Those suffering from diseases of the lungs dream\nof suffocation, of being crowded, and of flight, and a great many of\nthem are subject to the well-known nightmare, which, by the way, Boerner\nhas succeeded in producing experimentally by lying on the face and\nclosing up the openings of the respiratory organs. In digestive\ndisturbances the dream contains ideas from the sphere of enjoyment and\ndisgust. Finally, the influence of sexual excitement on the dream\ncontent is perceptible enough in every one\u2019s experience, and lends the\nstrongest support to the entire theory of the dream excitation through\norganic sensation.\nMoreover, as we go through the literature of the dream, it becomes quite\nobvious that some of the authors (Maury,[48] Weygandt[75]) have been led\nto the study of dream problems by the influence of their own\npathological state on the content of their dreams.\nThe addition to dream sources from these undoubtedly established facts\nis, however, not as important as one might be led to suppose; for the\ndream is a phenomenon which occurs in healthy persons\u2014perhaps in all\npersons, and every night\u2014and a pathological state of the organs is\napparently not one of its indispensable conditions. For us, however, the\nquestion is not whence particular dreams originate, but what may be the\nexciting source for the ordinary dreams of normal persons.\nBut we need go only a step further to find a dream source which is more\nprolific than any of those mentioned above, which indeed promises to be\ninexhaustible in every case. If it is established that the bodily organs\nbecome in sickness an exciting source of dreams, and if we admit that\nthe mind, diverted during sleep from the outer world, can devote more\nattention to the interior of the body, we may readily assume that the\norgans need not necessarily become diseased in order to permit stimuli,\nwhich in some way or other grow into dream pictures, to reach the\nsleeping mind. What in the waking state we broadly perceive as general\nsensation, distinguishable by its quality alone, to which, in the\nopinion of the physicians, all the organic systems contribute their\nshares\u2014this general sensation at night attaining powerful efficiency and\nbecoming active with its individual components\u2014would naturally furnish\nthe most powerful as well as the most common source for the production\nof the dream presentations. It still remains, however, to examine\naccording to what rule the organic sensations become transformed into\ndream presentations.\nThe theory of the origin of dreams just stated has been the favourite\nwith all medical authors. The obscurity which conceals the essence of\nour being\u2014the \u201c_moi splanchnique_,\u201d as Tissi\u00e9 terms it\u2014from our\nknowledge and the obscurity of the origin of the dream correspond too\nwell not to be brought into relation with each other. The train of\nthought which makes organic sensation the inciter of the dream has\nbesides another attraction for the physician, inasmuch as it favours the\netiological union of the dream and mental diseases, which show so many\nagreements in their manifestations, for alterations in the organic\nsensations and excitations emanating from the inner organs are both of\nwide significance in the origin of the psychoses. It is therefore not\nsurprising that the theory of bodily sensation can be traced to more\nthan one originator who has propounded it independently.\nA number of authors have been influenced by the train of ideas developed\nby the philosopher Schopenhauer in 1851. Our conception of the universe\noriginates through the fact that our intellect recasts the impressions\ncoming to it from without in the moulds of time, space, and causality.\nThe sensations from the interior of the organism, proceeding from the\nsympathetic nervous system, exert in the day-time an influence on our\nmood for the most part unconscious. At night, however, when the\noverwhelming influence of the day\u2019s impressions is no longer felt, the\nimpressions pressing upward from the interior are able to gain\nattention\u2014just as in the night we hear the rippling of the spring that\nwas rendered inaudible by the noise of the day. In what other way, then,\ncould the intellect react upon these stimuli than by performing its\ncharacteristic function? It will transform the stimuli into figures,\nfilling space and time, which move at the beginning of causality; and\nthus the dream originates. Scherner,[58] and after him Volkelt,[72]\nattempted to penetrate into closer relations between physical sensations\nand dream pictures; but we shall reserve the discussion of these\nattempts for the chapter on the theory of the dream.\nIn a study particularly logical in its development, the psychiatrist\nKrauss[39] found the origin of the dream as well as of deliria and\ndelusions in the same element, viz. the organically determined\nsensation. According to this author there is hardly a place in the\norganism which might not become the starting point of a dream or of a\ndelusion. Now organically determined sensations \u201cmay be divided into two\nclasses: (1) those of the total feeling (general sensations), (2)\nspecific sensations which are inherent in the principal systems of the\nvegetative organism, which may be divided into five groups: (_a_) the\nmuscular, (_b_) the pneumatic, (_c_) the gastric, (_d_) the sexual,\n(_e_) the peripheral sensations (p. 33 of the second article).\u201d\nThe origin of the dream picture on the basis of the physical sensations\nis conceived by Krauss as follows: The awakened sensation evokes a\npresentation related to it in accordance with some law of association,\nand combines with this, thus forming an organic structure, towards\nwhich, however, consciousness does not maintain its normal attitude. For\nit does not bestow any attention on the sensation itself, but concerns\nitself entirely with the accompanying presentation; this is likewise the\nreason why the state of affairs in question should have been so long\nmisunderstood (p. 11, &c.). Krauss finds for this process the specific\nterm of \u201ctransubstantiation of the feeling into dream pictures\u201d (p. 24).\nThat the organic bodily sensations exert some influence on the formation\nof the dream is nowadays almost universally acknowledged, but the\nquestion as to the law underlying the relation between the two is\nanswered in various ways and often in obscure terms. On the basis of the\ntheory of bodily excitation the special task of dream interpretation is\nto trace back the content of a dream to the causative organic stimulus,\nand if we do not recognise the rules of interpretation advanced by\nScherner,[58] we frequently find ourselves confronted with the awkward\nfact that the organic exciting source reveals itself in the content of\nthe dream only.\nA certain agreement, however, is manifested in the interpretation of the\nvarious forms of dreams which have been designated as \u201ctypical\u201d because\nthey recur in so many persons with almost the same contents. Among these\nare the well-known dreams of falling from heights, of the falling out of\nteeth, of flying, and of embarrassment because of being naked or barely\nclad. This last dream is said to be caused simply by the perception felt\nin sleep that one has thrown off the bedcover and is exposed. The dream\nof the falling out of teeth is explained by \u201cdental irritation,\u201d which\ndoes not, however, of necessity imply a morbid state of excitation in\nthe teeth. According to Str\u00fcmpell,[66] the flying dream is the adequate\npicture used by the mind to interpret the sum of excitation emanating\nfrom the rising and sinking of the pulmonary lobes after the cutaneous\nsensation of the thorax has been reduced to insensibility. It is this\nlatter circumstance that causes a sensation related to the conception of\nflying. Falling from a height in a dream is said to have its cause in\nthe fact that when unconsciousness of the sensation of cutaneous\npressure has set in, either an arm falls away from the body or a flexed\nknee is suddenly stretched out, causing the feeling of cutaneous\npressure to return to consciousness, and the transition to consciousness\nembodies itself psychically as a dream of falling. (Str\u00fcmpell, p. 118).\nThe weakness of these plausible attempts at explanation evidently lies\nin the fact that without any further elucidation they allow this or that\ngroup of organic sensations to disappear from psychic perception or to\nobtrude themselves upon it until the constellation favourable for the\nexplanation has been established. I shall, however, later have occasion\nto recur to typical dreams and to their origin.\nFrom comparison of a series of similar dreams, M. Simon[63] endeavoured\nto formulate certain rules for the influence of the organic sensations\non the determination of the resulting dream. He says (p. 34): \u201cIf any\norganic apparatus, which during sleep normally participates in the\nexpression of an affect, for any reason merges into the state of\nexcitation to which it is usually aroused by that affect, the dream thus\nproduced will contain presentations which fit the affect.\u201d\nAnother rule reads as follows (p. 35): \u201cIf an organic apparatus is in a\nstate of activity, excitation, or disturbance during sleep, the dream\nwill bring ideas which are related to the exercise of the organic\nfunction which is performed by that apparatus.\u201d\nMourly Vold[73] has undertaken to prove experimentally the influence\nassumed by the theory of bodily sensation for a single territory. He has\nmade experiments in altering the positions of the sleeper\u2019s limbs, and\nhas compared the resulting dream with his alterations. As a result he\nreports the following theories:\u2014\n1. The position of a limb in a dream corresponds approximately to that\nof reality, _i.e._ we dream of a static condition of the limb which\ncorresponds to the real condition.\n2. When one dreams of a moving limb it always happens that one of the\npositions occurring in the execution of this movement corresponds to the\nreal position.\n3. The position of one\u2019s own limb may be attributed in the dream to\nanother person.\n4. One may dream further that the movement in question is impeded.\n5. The limb in any particular position may appear in the dream as an\nanimal or monster, in which case a certain analogy between the two is\nestablished.\n6. The position of a limb may incite in the dream ideas which bear some\nrelation or other to this limb. Thus, _e.g._, if we are employed with\nthe fingers we dream of numerals.\nSuch results would lead me to conclude that even the theory of bodily\nsensation cannot fully extinguish the apparent freedom in the\ndetermination of the dream picture to be awakened.[I]\nIV. _Psychic Exciting Sources._\u2014In treating the relations of the dream\nto the waking life and the origin of the dream material, we learned that\nthe earliest as well as the latest investigators agreed that men dream\nof what they are doing in the day-time, and of what they are interested\nin during the waking state. This interest continuing from waking life\ninto sleep, besides being a psychic tie joining the dream to life, also\nfurnishes us a dream source not to be under-estimated, which, taken with\nthose stimuli which become interesting and active during sleep, suffices\nto explain the origin of all dream pictures. But we have also heard the\nopposite of the above assertion, viz. that the dream takes the sleeper\naway from the interests of the day, and that in most cases we do not\ndream of things that have occupied our attention during the day until\nafter they have lost for the waking life the stimulus of actuality.\nHence in the analysis of the dream life we are reminded at every step\nthat it is inadmissible to frame general rules without making provision\nfor qualifications expressed by such terms as \u201cfrequently,\u201d \u201cas a rule,\u201d\n\u201cin most cases,\u201d and without preparing for the validity of the\nexceptions.\nIf the conscious interest, together with the inner and outer sleep\nstimuli, sufficed to cover the etiology of the dreams, we ought to be in\na position to give a satisfactory account of the origin of all the\nelements of a dream; the riddle of the dream sources would thus be\nsolved, leaving only the task of separating the part played by the\npsychic and the somatic dream stimuli in individual dreams. But as a\nmatter of fact no such complete solution of a dream has ever been\naccomplished in any case, and, what is more, every one attempting such\nsolution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many\ncomponents of the dream, the source of which he was unable to explain.\nThe daily interest as a psychic source of dreams is evidently not\nfar-reaching enough to justify the confident assertions to the effect\nthat we all continue our waking affairs in the dream.\nOther psychic sources of dreams are unknown. Hence, with the exception\nperhaps of the explanation of dreams given by Scherner,[58] which will\nbe referred to later, all explanations found in the literature show a\nlarge gap when we come to the derivation of the material for the\npresentation pictures, which is most characteristic for the dream. In\nthis dilemma the majority of authors have developed a tendency to\ndepreciate as much as possible the psychic factor in the excitations of\ndreams which is so difficult to approach. To be sure, they distinguish\nas a main division of dreams the nerve-exciting and the association\ndreams, and assert that the latter has its source exclusively in\nreproduction (Wundt,[76] p. 365), but they cannot yet dismiss the doubt\nwhether \u201cthey do not appear without being impelled by the psychical\nstimulus\u201d (Volkelt,[72] p. 127). The characteristic quality of the pure\nassociation dream is also found wanting. To quote Volkelt (p. 118): \u201cIn\nthe association dreams proper we can no longer speak of such a firm\nnucleus. Here the loose grouping penetrates also into the centre of the\ndream. The ideation which is already set free from reason and intellect\nis here no longer held together by the more important psychical and\nmental stimuli, but is left to its own aimless shifting and complete\nconfusion.\u201d Wundt, too, attempts to depreciate the psychic factor in the\nstimulation of dreams by declaring that the \u201cphantasms of the dream\ncertainly are unjustly regarded as pure hallucinations, and that\nprobably most dream presentations are really illusions, inasmuch as they\nemanate from slight sensory impressions which are never extinguished\nduring sleep\u201d (p. 338, &c.). Weygandt[75] agrees with this view, but\ngeneralises it. He asserts that \u201cthe first source of all dream\npresentations is a sensory stimulus to which reproductive associations\nare then joined\u201d (p. 17). Tissi\u00e9[68] goes still further in repressing\nthe psychic exciting sources (p. 183): \u201cLes r\u00eaves d\u2019origine absolument\npsychique n\u2019existent pas\u201d; and elsewhere (p. 6), \u201cLes pens\u00e9es de nos\nr\u00eaves nous viennent de dehors....\u201d\nThose authors who, like the influential philosopher Wundt, adopt a\nmiddle course do not fail to remark that in most dreams there is a\nco-operation of the somatic stimuli with the psychic instigators of the\ndream, the latter being either unknown or recognised as day interests.\nWe shall learn later that the riddle of the dream formation can be\nsolved by the disclosure of an unsuspected psychic source of excitement.\nFor the present we shall not be surprised at the over-estimation of\nthose stimuli for the formation of the dream which do not originate from\npsychic life. It is not merely because they alone can easily be found\nand even confirmed by experiment, but the somatic conception of the\norigin of dreams thoroughly corresponds to the mode of thinking in vogue\nnowadays in psychiatry. Indeed, the mastery of the brain over the\norganism is particularly emphasized; but everything that might prove an\nindependence of the psychic life from the demonstrable organic changes,\nor a spontaneity in its manifestations, is alarming to the psychiatrist\nnowadays, as if an acknowledgment of the same were bound to bring back\nthe times of natural philosophy and the metaphysical conception of the\npsychic essence. The distrust of the psychiatrist has placed the psyche\nunder a guardian, so to speak, and now demands that none of its feelings\nshall divulge any of its own faculties; but this attitude shows slight\nconfidence in the stability of the causal concatenation which extends\nbetween the material and the psychic. Even where on investigation the\npsychic can be recognised as the primary course of a phenomenon, a more\nprofound penetration will some day succeed in finding a continuation of\nthe path to the organic determination of the psychic. But where the\npsychic must be taken as the terminus for our present knowledge, it\nshould not be denied on that account.\n(_d_) _Why the Dream is Forgotten after Awakening._\u2014That the dream\n\u201cfades away\u201d in the morning is proverbial. To be sure, it is capable of\nrecollection. For we know the dream only by recalling it after\nawakening; but very often we believe that we remember it only\nincompletely, and that during the night there was more of it; we can\nobserve how the memory of a dream which has been still vivid in the\nmorning vanishes in the course of the day, leaving only a few small\nfragments; we often know that we have been dreaming, but we do not know\nwhat; and we are so well used to the fact that the dream is liable to be\nforgotten that we do not reject as absurd the possibility that one may\nhave been dreaming even when one knows nothing in the morning of either\nthe contents or the fact of dreaming. On the other hand, it happens that\ndreams manifest an extraordinary retentiveness in the memory. I have had\noccasion to analyse with my patients dreams which had occurred to them\ntwenty-five years or more previously, and I can remember a dream of my\nown which is separated from the present day by at least thirty-seven\nyears, and yet has lost nothing of its freshness in my memory. All this\nis very remarkable, and for the present incomprehensible.\nThe forgetting of dreams is treated in the most detailed manner by\nStr\u00fcmpell.[66] This forgetting is evidently a complex phenomenon; for\nStr\u00fcmpell does not explain it by a single reason, but by a considerable\nnumber of reasons.\nIn the first place, all those factors which produce forgetfulness in the\nwaking state are also determinant for the forgetting of dreams. When\nawake we are wont soon to forget a large number of sensations and\nperceptions because they are too feeble, and because they are connected\nwith a slight amount of emotional feeling. This is also the case with\nmany dream pictures; they are forgotten because they are too weak, while\nstronger pictures in proximity will be remembered. Moreover, the factor\nof intensity in itself is not the only determinant for the preservation\nof the dream pictures; Str\u00fcmpell, as well as other authors (Calkins),\nadmits that dream pictures are often rapidly forgotten, although they\nare known to have been vivid, whereas among those that are retained in\nmemory there are many that are very shadowy and hazy. Besides, in the\nwaking state one is wont to forget easily what happened only once, and\nto note more easily things of repeated occurrence. But most dream\npictures are single experiences,[J] and this peculiarity equally\ncontributes towards the forgetting of all dreams. Of greater\nsignificance is a third motive for forgetting. In order that feelings,\npresentations, thoughts and the like, should attain a certain degree of\nmemory, it is important that they should not remain isolated, but that\nthey should enter into connections and associations of a suitable kind.\nIf the words of a short verse are taken and mixed together, it will be\nvery difficult to remember them. \u201cWhen well arranged in suitable\nsequence one word will help another, and the whole remains as sense\neasily and firmly in the memory for a long time. Contradictions we\nusually retain with just as much difficulty and rarity as things\nconfused and disarranged.\u201d Now dreams in most cases lack sense and\norder. Dream compositions are by their very nature incapable of being\nremembered, and they are forgotten because they usually crumble together\nthe very next moment. To be sure, these conclusions are not in full\naccord with the observation of Radestock[54] (p. 168), that we retain\nbest just those dreams which are most peculiar.\nAccording to Str\u00fcmpell, there are still other factors effective in the\nforgetting of dreams which are derived from the relation of the dream to\nthe waking state. The forgetfulness of the waking consciousness for\ndreams is evidently only the counterpart of the fact already mentioned,\nthat the dream (almost) never takes over successive memories from the\nwaking state, but only certain details of these memories which it tears\naway from the habitual psychic connections in which they are recalled\nwhile we are awake. The dream composition, therefore, has no place in\nthe company of psychic successions which fill the mind. It lacks all the\naids of memory. \u201cIn this manner the dream structure rises, as it were,\nfrom the soil of our psychic life, and floats in psychic space like a\ncloud in the sky, which the next breath of air soon dispels\u201d (p. 87).\nThis is also aided by the fact that, upon awakening, the attention is\nimmediately seized by the inrushing sensory world, and only very few\ndream pictures can withstand this power. They fade away before the\nimpressions of the new day like the glow of the stars before the\nsunlight.\nAs a last factor favouring the forgetting of dreams, we may mention the\nfact that most people generally take little interest in their dreams.\nOne who investigates dreams for a time, and takes a special interest in\nthem, usually dreams more during that time than at any other; that is,\nhe remembers his dreams more easily and more frequently.\nTwo other reasons for the forgetting of dreams added by Bonatelli (given\nby Benini[3]) to those of Str\u00fcmpell have already been included in the\nlatter; namely, (1) that the change of the general feeling between the\nsleeping and waking states is unfavourable to the mutual reproductions,\nand (2) that the different arrangement of the presentation material in\nthe dream makes the dream untranslatable, so to speak, for the waking\nconsciousness.\nIt is the more remarkable, as Str\u00fcmpell observes, that, in spite of all\nthese reasons for forgetting the dream, so many dreams are retained in\nmemory. The continued efforts of the authors to formulate laws for the\nremembering of dreams amounts to an admission that here too there is\nsomething puzzling and unsolved. Certain peculiarities relating to the\nmemory of dreams have been particularly noticed of late, _e.g._, that a\ndream which is considered forgotten in the morning may be recalled in\nthe course of the day through a perception which accidentally touches\nthe forgotten content of the dream (Radestock,[54] Tissi\u00e9[68]). The\nentire memory of the dream is open to an objection calculated to\ndepreciate its value very markedly in critical eyes. One may doubt\nwhether our memory, which omits so much from the dream, does not falsify\nwhat it retained.\nSuch doubts relating to the exactness of the reproduction of the dream\nare expressed by Str\u00fcmpell when he says: \u201cIt therefore easily happens\nthat the active consciousness involuntarily inserts much in recollection\nof the dream; one imagines one has dreamt all sorts of things which the\nactual dream did not contain.\u201d\nJessen[36] (p. 547) expresses himself very decidedly: \u201cMoreover we must\nnot lose sight of the fact, hitherto little heeded, that in the\ninvestigation and interpretation of orderly and logical dreams we almost\nalways play with the truth when we recall a dream to memory.\nUnconsciously and unwittingly we fill up the gaps and supplement the\ndream pictures. Rarely, and perhaps never, has a connected dream been as\nconnected as it appears to us in memory. Even the most truth-loving\nperson can hardly relate a dream without exaggerating and embellishing\nit. The tendency of the human mind to conceive everything in connection\nis so great that it unwittingly supplies the deficiencies of connection\nif the dream is recalled somewhat disconnectedly.\u201d\nThe observations of V. Eggers,[20] though surely independently\nconceived, sound almost like a translation of Jessen\u2019s words: \u201c...\nL\u2019observation des r\u00eaves a ses difficult\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciales et le seul moyen\nd\u2019\u00e9viter toute erreur en pareille mati\u00e8re est de confier au papier sans\nle moindre retard ce que l\u2019on vient d\u2019\u00e9prouver et de remarquer; sinon,\nl\u2019oubli vient vite ou total ou partiel; l\u2019oubli total est sans gravit\u00e9;\nmais l\u2019oubli partiel est perfide; car si l\u2019on se met ensuite \u00e0 raconter\nce que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas oubli\u00e9, on est expos\u00e9 \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter par imagination\nles fragments incoh\u00e9rents et disjoints fourni par la m\u00e9moire ...; on\ndevient artiste \u00e0 son insu, et le r\u00e9cit, p\u00e9riodiquement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019impose\n\u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance de son auteur, qui, de bonne foi, le pr\u00e9sente comme un fait\nauthentique, d\u00fbment \u00e9tabli selon les bonnes m\u00e9thodes....\u201d\nSimilarly Spitta,[64] who seems to think that it is only in our attempt\nto reproduce the dream that we put in order the loosely associated dream\nelements: \u201cTo make connection out of disconnection, that is, to add the\nprocess of logical connection which is absent in the dream.\u201d\nAs we do not at present possess any other objective control for the\nreliability of our memory, and as indeed such a control is impossible in\nexamining the dream which is our own experience, and for which our\nmemory is the only source, it is a question what value we may attach to\nour recollections of dreams.\n(_e_) _The Psychological Peculiarities of Dreams._\u2014In the scientific\ninvestigation of the dream we start with the assumption that the dream\nis an occurrence of our own psychic activity; nevertheless the finished\ndream appears to us as something strange, the authorship of which we are\nso little forced to recognise that we can just as easily say \u201ca dream\nappeared to me,\u201d as \u201cI have dreamt.\u201d Whence this \u201cpsychic strangeness\u201d\nof the dream? According to our discussion of the sources of dreams we\nmay suppose that it does not depend on the material reaching the dream\ncontent; because this is for the most part common to the dream life and\nwaking life. One may ask whether in the dream it is not changes in the\npsychic processes which call forth this impression, and may so put to\ntest a psychological characteristic of the dream.\nNo one has more strongly emphasized the essential difference between\ndream and waking life, and utilised this difference for more\nfar-reaching conclusions, than G. Th. Fechner[25] in some observations\nin his _Elements of Psychophysic_ (p. 520, part 11). He believes that\n\u201cneither the simple depression of conscious psychic life under the main\nthreshold,\u201d nor the distraction of attention from the influences of the\nouter world, suffices to explain the peculiarities of the dream life as\ncompared with the waking life. He rather believes that the scene of\ndreams is laid elsewhere than in the waking presentation life. \u201cIf the\nscene of the psychophysical activity were the same during the sleeping\nand the waking states, the dream, in my opinion, could only be a\ncontinuation of the waking ideation maintaining itself at a lower degree\nof intensity, and must moreover share with the latter its material and\nform. But the state of affairs is quite different.\u201d\nWhat Fechner really meant has never been made clear, nor has anybody\nelse, to my knowledge, followed further the road, the clue to which he\nindicated in this remark. An anatomical interpretation in the sense of\nphysiological brain localisations, or even in reference to histological\nsections of the cerebral cortex, will surely have to be excluded. The\nthought may, however, prove ingenious and fruitful if it can be referred\nto a psychic apparatus which is constructed out of many instances placed\none behind another.\nOther authors have been content to render prominent one or another of\nthe tangible psychological peculiarities of the dream life, and perhaps\nto take these as a starting point for more far-reaching attempts at\nexplanation.\nIt has been justly remarked that one of the main peculiarities of the\ndream life appears even in the state of falling asleep, and is to be\ndesignated as the phenomenon inducing sleep. According to\nSchleiermacher[61] (p. 351), the characteristic part of the waking state\nis the fact that the psychic activity occurs in ideas rather than in\npictures. But the dream thinks in pictures, and one may observe that\nwith the approach of sleep the voluntary activities become difficult in\nthe same measure as the involuntary appear, the latter belonging wholly\nto the class of pictures. The inability for such presentation work as we\nperceive to be intentionally desired, and the appearance of pictures\nwhich is regularly connected with this distraction, these are two\nqualities which are constant in the dream, and which in its\npsychological analysis we must recognise as essential characters of the\ndream life. Concerning the pictures\u2014the hypnogogic hallucinations\u2014we\nhave discovered that even in their content they are identical with the\ndream pictures.\nThe dream therefore thinks preponderately, but not exclusively, in\nvisual pictures. It also makes use of auditory pictures, and to a lesser\nextent of the impressions of the other senses. Much is also simply\nthought or imagined (probably represented by remnants of word\npresentations), just as in the waking state. But still what is\ncharacteristic for the dream is only those elements of the content which\nact like pictures, _i.e._ which resemble more the perceptions than the\nmemory presentations. Disregarding all the discussions concerning the\nnature of hallucinations, familiar to every psychiatrist, we can say,\nwith all well-versed authors, that the dream hallucinates, that is,\nreplaces thoughts through hallucinations. In this respect there is no\ndifference between visual and acoustic presentations; it has been\nnoticed that the memory of a succession of sounds with which one falls\nasleep becomes transformed while sinking into sleep into an\nhallucination of the same melody, so as to make room again on awakening,\nwhich may repeatedly alternate with falling into a slumber, for the\nsofter memory presentations which are differently formed in quality.\nThe transformation of an idea into an hallucination is not the only\ndeviation of the dream from a waking thought which perhaps corresponds\nto it. From these pictures the dream forms a situation, it presents\nsomething in the present, it dramatises an idea, as Spitta[64] (p. 145)\nputs it.[K] But the characteristic of this side of the dream life\nbecomes complete only when it is remembered that while dreaming we do\nnot\u2014as a rule; the exceptions require a special explanation\u2014imagine that\nwe are thinking, but that we are living through an experience, _i.e._,\nwe accept the hallucination with full belief. The criticism that this\nhas not been experienced but only thought in a peculiar\nmanner\u2014dreamt\u2014comes to us only on awakening. This character\ndistinguishes the genuine sleeping dream from day dreaming, which is\nnever confused with reality.\nThe characteristics of the dream life thus far considered have been\nsummed up by Burdach[8] (p. 476) in the following sentences: \u201cAs\ncharacteristic features of the dream we may add (_a_) that the\nsubjective activity of our mind appears as objective, inasmuch as our\nfaculty of perception perceives the products of phantasy as if they were\nsensory activities ... (_b_) sleep abrogates one\u2019s self-command, hence\nfalling asleep necessitates a certain amount of passivity.... The\nslumber pictures are conditioned by the relaxation of one\u2019s\nself-command.\u201d\nIt is a question now of attempting to explain the credulity of the mind\nin reference to the dream hallucinations, which can only appear after\nthe suspension of a certain arbitrary activity. Str\u00fcmpell[66] asserts\nthat the mind behaves in this respect correctly, and in conformity with\nits mechanism. The dream elements are by no means mere presentations,\nbut true and real experiences of the mind, similar to those that appear\nin the waking state as a result of the senses (p. 34). Whereas in the\nwaking state the mind represents and thinks in word pictures and\nlanguage, in the dream it represents and thinks in real tangible\npictures (p. 35). Besides, the dream manifests a consciousness of space\nby transferring the sensations and pictures, just as in the waking\nstate, into an outer space (p. 36). It must therefore be admitted that\nthe mind in the dream is in the same relation to its pictures and\nperceptions as in the waking state (p. 43). If, however, it is thereby\nled astray, this is due to the fact that it lacks in sleep the criticism\nwhich alone can distinguish between the sensory perceptions emanating\nfrom within or from without. It cannot subject its pictures to the tests\nwhich alone can prove their objective reality. It furthermore neglects\nto differentiate between pictures that are arbitrarily interchanged and\nothers where there is no free choice. It errs because it cannot apply to\nits content the law of causality (p. 58). In brief, its alienation from\nthe outer world contains also the reason for its belief in the\nsubjective dream world.\nDelb\u0153uf[16] reaches the same conclusion through a somewhat different\nline of argument. We give to the dream pictures the credence of reality\nbecause in sleep we have no other impressions to compare them with,\nbecause we are cut off from the outer world. But it is not perhaps\nbecause we are unable to make tests in our sleep, that we believe in the\ntruth of our hallucinations. The dream may delude us with all these\ntests, it may make us believe that we may touch the rose that we see in\nthe dream, and still we only dream. According to Delb\u0153uf there is no\nvalid criterion to show whether something is a dream or a conscious\nreality, except\u2014and that only in practical generality\u2014the fact of\nawakening. \u201cI declare delusional everything that is experienced between\nthe period of falling asleep and awakening, if I notice on awakening\nthat I lie in my bed undressed\u201d (p. 84). \u201cI have considered the dream\npictures real during sleep in consequence of the mental habit, which\ncannot be put to sleep, of perceiving an outer world with which I can\ncontrast my ego.\u201d[L]\nAs the deviation from the outer world is taken as the stamp for the most\nstriking characteristics of the dream, it will be worth while mentioning\nsome ingenious observations of old Burdach[8] which will throw light on\nthe relation of the sleeping mind to the outer world and at the same\ntime serve to prevent us from over-estimating the above deductions.\n\u201cSleep results only under the condition,\u201d says Burdach, \u201cthat the mind\nis not excited by sensory stimuli ... but it is not the lack of sensory\nstimuli that conditions sleep, but rather a lack of interest for the\nsame; some sensory impressions are even necessary in so far as they\nserve to calm the mind; thus the miller can fall asleep only when he\nhears the rattling of his mill, and he who finds it necessary to burn a\nlight at night, as a matter of precaution, cannot fall asleep in the\ndark\u201d (p. 457).\n\u201cThe psyche isolates itself during sleep from the outer world, and\nwithdraws from the periphery.... Nevertheless, the connection is not\nentirely interrupted; if one did not hear and feel even during sleep,\nbut only after awakening, he would certainly never awake. The\ncontinuance of sensation is even more plainly shown by the fact that we\nare not always awakened by the mere sensory force of the impression, but\nby the psychic relation of the same; an indifferent word does not arouse\nthe sleeper, but if called by name he awakens ...: hence the psyche\ndifferentiates sensations during sleep.... It is for this reason that we\nmay be awakened by the lack of a sensory stimulus if it relates to the\npresentation of an important thing; thus one awakens when the light is\nextinguished, and the miller when the mill comes to a standstill; that\nis, the awakening is due to the cessation of a sensory activity, which\npresupposes that it has been perceived, and that it has not disturbed\nthe mind, being indifferent or rather gratifying\u201d (p. 460, &c.).\nIf we are willing to disregard these objections, which are not to be\ntaken lightly, we still must admit that the qualities of the dream life\nthus far considered, which originate by withdrawing from the outer\nworld, cannot fully explain the strangeness of the dream. For otherwise\nit would be possible to change back the hallucinations of the dream into\npresentations and the situations of the dream into thoughts, and thus to\nperform the task of dream interpretation. Now this is what we do when we\nreproduce the dream from memory after awakening, and whether we are\nfully or only partially successful in this back translation the dream\nstill retains its mysteriousness undiminished.\nFurthermore all the authors assume unhesitatingly that still other more\nfar-reaching alterations take place in the presentation material of\nwaking life. One of them, Str\u00fcmpell,[66] expresses himself as follows\n(p. 17): \u201cWith the cessation of the objectively active outlook and of\nthe normal consciousness, the psyche loses the foundation in which were\nrooted the feelings, desires, interests, and actions. Those psychic\nstates, feelings, interests, estimates which cling in the waking state\nto the memory pictures also succumb to ... an obscure pressure, in\nconsequence of which their connection with the pictures becomes severed;\nthe perception pictures of things, persons, localities, events, and\nactions of the waking state are singly very abundantly reproduced, but\nnone of these brings along its psychic value. The latter is removed from\nthem, and hence they float about in the mind dependent upon their own\nresources....\u201d\nThis deprivation the picture suffers of its psychic value, which again\ngoes back to the derivation from the outer world, is according to\nStr\u00fcmpell mainly responsible for the impression of strangeness with\nwhich the dream is confronted in our memory.\nWe have heard that even falling asleep carries with it the abandonment\nof one of the psychic activities\u2014namely, the voluntary conduct of the\npresentation course. Thus the supposition, suggested also by other\ngrounds, obtrudes itself, that the sleeping state may extend its\ninfluence also over the psychic functions. One or the other of these\nfunctions is perhaps entirely suspended; whether the remaining ones\ncontinue to work undisturbed, whether they can furnish normal work under\nthe circumstances, is the next question. The idea occurs to us that the\npeculiarities of the dream may be explained through the inferior psychic\nactivity during the sleeping state, but now comes the impression made by\nthe dream upon our waking judgment which is contrary to such a\nconception. The dream is disconnected, it unites without hesitation the\nworst contradictions, it allows impossibilities, it disregards our\nauthoritative knowledge from the day, and evinces ethical and moral\ndulness. He who would behave in the waking state as the dream does in\nits situations would be considered insane. He who in the waking state\nwould speak in such manner or report such things as occur in the dream\ncontent, would impress us as confused and weak-minded. Thus we believe\nthat we are only finding words for the fact when we place but little\nvalue on the psychic activity in the dream, and especially when we\ndeclare that the higher intellectual activities are suspended or at\nleast much impaired in the dream.\nWith unusual unanimity\u2014the exceptions will be dealt with elsewhere\u2014the\nauthors have pronounced their judgments on the dream\u2014such judgments as\nlead immediately to a definite theory or explanation of the dream life.\nIt is time that I should supplement the _r\u00e9sum\u00e9_ which I have just given\nwith a collection of the utterances of different authors\u2014philosophers\nand physicians\u2014on the psychological character of the dream.\nAccording to Lemoine,[42] the incoherence of the dream picture is the\nonly essential character of the dream.\nMaury[48] agrees with him; he says (p. 163): \u201cIl n\u2019y a pas des r\u00eaves\nabsolument raisonnables et qui ne contiennent quelque incoh\u00e9rence,\nquelque anachronisme, quelque absurdit\u00e9.\u201d\nAccording to Hegel, quoted by Spitta,[64] the dream lacks all objective\nand comprehensible connection.\nDugas[19] says: \u201cLe r\u00eave, c\u2019est l\u2019anarchie psychique, affective et\nmentale, c\u2019est le jeu des fonctions livr\u00e9es \u00e0 elles-m\u00eames et s\u2019exer\u00e7ant\nsans contr\u00f4le et sans but; dans le r\u00eave l\u2019esprit est un automate\nspirituel.\u201d\n\u201cThe relaxation, solution, and confusion of the presentation life which\nis held together through the logical force of the central ego\u201d is\nconceded even by Volkelt[72] (p. 14), according to whose theory the\npsychic activity during sleep seems in no way aimless.\nThe absurdity of the presentation connections appearing in the dream can\nhardly be more strongly condemned than it was by Cicero (_De Divin._\nII.): \u201cNihil tam praepostere, tam incondite, tam monstruose cogitari\npotest, quod non possimus somniare.\u201d\nFechner[52] says (p. 522): \u201cIt is as if the psychological activity were\ntransferred from the brain of a reasonable being into the brain of a\nfool.\u201d\nRadestock[35] (p. 145) says: \u201cIt seems indeed impossible to recognise in\nthis absurd action any firm law. Having withdrawn itself from the strict\npolice of the rational will guiding the waking presentation life, and of\nthe attention, the dream whirls everything about kaleidoscopically in\nmad play.\u201d\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 45) says: \u201cWhat wonderful jumps the dreamer allows\nhimself, _e.g._, in his chain of reasoning! With what unconcern he sees\nthe most familiar laws of experience turned upside down! What ridiculous\ncontradictions he can tolerate in the orders of nature and society\nbefore things go too far, as we say, and the overstraining of the\nnonsense brings an awakening! We often multiply quite unconcernedly:\nthree times three make twenty; we are not at all surprised when a dog\nrecites poetry for us, when a dead person walks to his grave, and when a\nrock swims on the water; we go in all earnestness by high command to the\nduchy of Bernburg or the principality of Lichtenstein in order to\nobserve the navy of the country, or we allow ourselves to be recruited\nas a volunteer by Charles XII. shortly before the battle of Poltawa.\u201d\nBinz[4] (p. 33) points to a dream theory resulting from the impressions.\n\u201cAmong ten dreams nine at least have an absurd content. We unite in them\npersons or things which do not bear the slightest relation to one\nanother. In the next moment, as in a kaleidoscope, the grouping changes,\nif possible to one more nonsensical and irrational than before; thus the\nchanging play of the imperfectly sleeping brain continues until we\nawaken, and put our hand to our forehead and ask ourselves whether we\nreally still possess the faculty of rational imagination and thought.\u201d\nMaury[48] (p. 50) finds for the relation of the dream picture to the\nwaking thoughts, a comparison most impressive for the physician: \u201cLa\nproduction de ces images que chez l\u2019homme \u00e9veill\u00e9 fait le plus souvent\nna\u00eetre la volont\u00e9, correspond, pour l\u2019intelligence, \u00e0 ce que cont pour\nla motilit\u00e9 certains mouvements que nous offrent la chor\u00e9e et les\naffections paralytiques....\u201d For the rest, he considers the dream \u201ctoute\nune s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9gradation de la facult\u00e9 pensant et raisonant\u201d (p. 27).\nIt is hardly necessary to mention the utterances of the authors which\nrepeat Maury\u2019s assertion for the individual higher psychic activities.\nAccording to Str\u00fcmpell,[66] some logical mental operations based on\nrelations and connections disappear in the dream\u2014naturally also at\npoints where the nonsense is not obvious (p. 26). According to\nSpitta,[64] (p. 148) the presentations in the dream are entirely\nwithdrawn from the laws of causality. Radestock[54] and others emphasize\nthe weakness of judgment and decision in the dream. According to\nJodl[37] (p. 123), there is no critique in the dream, and no correcting\nof a series of perceptions through the content of the sum of\nconsciousness. The same author states that \u201call forms of conscious\nactivity occur in the dream, but they are imperfect, inhibited, and\nisolated from one another.\u201d The contradictions manifested in the dream\ntowards our conscious knowledge are explained by Stricker[77][78] (and\nmany others), on the ground that facts are forgotten in the dream and\nlogical relations between presentations are lost (p. 98), &c., &c.\nThe authors who in general speak thus unfavourably about the psychic\ncapacities in the dream, nevertheless admit that the dream retains a\ncertain remnant of psychic activity. Wundt,[76] whose teaching has\ninfluenced so many other workers in the dream problems, positively\nadmits this. One might inquire as to the kind and behaviour of the\nremnants of the psychic life which manifest themselves in the dream. It\nis now quite universally acknowledged that the reproductive capacity,\nthe memory in the dream, seems to have been least affected; indeed it\nmay show a certain superiority over the same function in the waking life\n(_vid. supra_, p. 10), although a part of the absurdities of the dream\nare to be explained by just this forgetfulness of the dream life.\nAccording to Spitta,[64] it is the emotional life of the psyche that is\nnot overtaken by sleep and that then directs the dream. \u201cBy emotion\n[\u201cGem\u00fcth\u201d] we understand the constant comprehension of the feelings as\nthe inmost subjective essence of man\u201d (p. 84).\nScholz[59] (p. 37) sees a psychic activity manifested in the dream in\nthe \u201callegorising interpretation\u201d to which the dream material is\nsubjected. Siebeck[62] verifies also in the dream the \u201csupplementary\ninterpretative activity\u201d (p. 11) which the mind exerts on all that is\nperceived and viewed. The judgment of the apparently highest psychic\nfunction, the consciousness, presents for the dream a special\ndifficulty. As we can know anything only through consciousness, there\ncan be no doubt as to its retention; Spitta, however, believes that only\nconsciousness is retained in the dream, and not self-consciousness.\nDelb\u0153uf[16] confesses that he is unable to conceive this\ndifferentiation.\nThe laws of association which govern the connection of ideas hold true\nalso for the dream pictures; indeed, their domination evinces itself in\na purer and stronger expression in the dream than elsewhere.\nStr\u00fcmpell[62] (p. 70) says: \u201cThe dream follows either the laws of\nundisguised presentations as it seems exclusively or organic stimuli\nalong with such presentations, that is, without being influenced by\nreflection and reason, \u00e6sthetic sense, and moral judgment.\u201d The authors\nwhose views I reproduce here conceive the formation of the dream in\nabout the following manner: The sum of sensation stimuli affecting sleep\nfrom the various sources, discussed elsewhere, at first awaken in the\nmind a sum of presentations which represent themselves as hallucinations\n(according to Wundt, it is more correct to say as illusions, because of\ntheir origin from outer and inner stimuli). These unite with one another\naccording to the known laws of association, and, following the same\nrules, in turn evoke a new series of presentations (pictures). This\nentire material is then elaborated as well as possible by the still\nactive remnant of the organising and thinking mental faculties (_cf._\nWundt[76] and Weygandt[75]). But thus far no one has been successful in\nfinding the motive which would decide that the awakening of pictures\nwhich do not originate objectively follow this or that law of\nassociation.\nBut it has been repeatedly observed that the associations which connect\nthe dream presentations with one another are of a particular kind, and\ndifferent from those found in the waking mental activity. Thus\nVolkelt[72] says: \u201cIn the dream, the ideas chase and hunt each other on\nthe strength of accidental similarities and barely perceptible\nconnections. All dreams are pervaded by such loose and free\nassociations.\u201d Maury[48] attaches great value to this characteristic of\nconnection between presentations, which allows him to bring the dream\nlife in closer analogy to certain mental disturbances. He recognises two\nmain characters of the _d\u00e9lire_: \u201c(1) une action spontan\u00e9e et comme\nautomatique de l\u2019esprit; (2) une association vicieuse et irreguli\u00e8re des\nid\u00e9es\u201d (p. 126). Maury gives us two excellent examples from his own\ndreams, in which the mere similarity of sound forms the connection of\nthe dream presentations. He dreamed once that he undertook a pilgrimage\n(_p\u00e9lerinage_) to Jerusalem or Mecca. After many adventures he was with\nthe chemist Pelletier; the latter after some talk gave him a zinc shovel\n(_pelle_) which became his long battle sword in the dream fragment which\nfollowed (p. 137). On another occasion he walked in a dream on the\nhighway and read the kilometres on the milestones; presently he was with\na spice merchant who had large scales with which to weigh Maury; the\nspice merchant then said to him: \u201cYou are not in Paris; but on the\nisland Gilolo.\u201d This was followed by many pictures, in which he saw the\nflower Lobelia, then the General Lopez, of whose demise he had read\nshortly before. He finally awoke while playing a game of lotto.\nWe are, however, quite prepared to hear that this depreciation of the\npsychic activities of the dream has not remained without contradiction\nfrom the other side. To be sure, contradiction seems difficult here. Nor\nis it of much significance that one of the depreciators of dream life,\nSpitta[64] (p. 118), assures us that the same psychological laws which\ngovern the waking state rule the dream also, or that another (Dugas[19])\nstates: \u201cLe r\u00eave n\u2019est pas d\u00e9raison ni m\u00eame irraison pure,\u201d as long as\nneither of them has made any effort to bring this estimation into\nharmony with the psychic anarchy and dissolution of all functions in the\ndream described by them. Upon others, however, the possibility seems to\nhave dawned that the madness of the dream is perhaps not without its\nmethod\u2014that it is perhaps only a sham, like that of the Danish prince,\nto whose madness the intelligent judgment here cited refers. These\nauthors must have refrained from judging by appearances, or the\nappearance which the dream showed to them was quite different.\nWithout wishing to linger at its apparent absurdity, Havelock Ellis[23]\nconsiders the dream as \u201can archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\nthoughts,\u201d the study of which may make us acquainted with primitive\nstages of development of the psychic life. A thinker like Delb\u0153uf[16]\nasserts\u2014to be sure without adducing proof against the contradictory\nmaterial, and hence indeed unjustly: \u201cDans le sommeil, hormis la\nperception, toutes les facult\u00e9s de l\u2019esprit, intelligence, imagination,\nm\u00e9moire, volont\u00e9, moralit\u00e9, restant intactes dans leur essence;\nseulement, elles s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 des objets imaginaires et mobiles. Le\nsongeur est un acteur qui joue \u00e0 volont\u00e9 les fous et les sages, les\nbourreaux et les victimes, les nains et les g\u00e9ants, les d\u00e9mons et les\nanges\u201d (p. 222). The Marquis of Hervey, who is sharply controverted by\nMaury,[48] and whose work I could not obtain despite all effort, seems\nto combat most energetically the under-estimation of the psychic\ncapacity in the dream. Maury speaks of him as follows (p. 19): \u201cM. le\nMarquis d\u2019Hervey pr\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019intelligence, durant le sommeil toute sa\nlibert\u00e9 d\u2019action et d\u2019attention et il ne semble faire consister le\nsommeil que dans l\u2019occlusion des sens, dans leur fermeture au monde\next\u00e9rieur; en sorte que l\u2019homme qui dort ne se distingu\u00e9 gu\u00e8re, selon sa\nmani\u00e8re de voir, de l\u2019homme qui laisse vaguer sa pens\u00e9e en se bouchant\nles sens; toute la diff\u00e9rence qui s\u00e9par\u00e9 alors la pens\u00e9e ordinaire du\ncelle du dormeur c\u2019est que, chez celui-ci, l\u2019id\u00e9e prend une forme\nvisible, objective et ressemble, \u00e0 s\u2019y m\u00e9prendre, \u00e0 la sensation\nd\u00e9termin\u00e9e par les objets ext\u00e9rieurs; le souvenir rev\u00eat l\u2019apparence du\nfait pr\u00e9sent.\u201d\nMaury adds, however; \u201cQu\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence de plus et capitale \u00e0\nsavoir que les facult\u00e9s intellectuelles de l\u2019homme endormi n\u2019offrent pas\nl\u2019\u00e9quilibre qu\u2019elles gardent chez l\u2019homme l\u2019\u00e9veill\u00e9.\u201d\nThe scale of the estimation of the dream as a psychic product has a\ngreat range in the literature; it reaches from the lowest\nunder-estimation, the expression of which we have come to know, through\nthe idea of a value not yet revealed to the over-estimation which places\nthe dream far above the capacities of the waking life. Hildebrandt,[35]\nwho, as we know, sketches the psychological characteristics into three\nantinomies, sums up in the third of these contradistinctions the extreme\npoints of this series as follows (p. 19): \u201cIt is between a climax, often\nan involution which raises itself to virtuosity, and on the other hand a\ndecided diminution and weakening of the psychic life often leading below\nthe human niveau.\u201d\n\u201cAs for the first, who could not confirm from his own experience that,\nin the creations and weavings of the genius of the dream, there\nsometimes comes to light a profundity and sincerity of emotion, a\ntenderness of feeling, a clearness of view, a fineness of observation,\nand a readiness of wit, all which we should modestly have to deny that\nwe possess as a constant property during the waking life? The dream has\na wonderful poetry, an excellent allegory, an incomparable humour, and a\ncharming irony. It views the world under the guise of a peculiar\nidealisation, and often raises the effect of its manifestations into the\nmost ingenious understanding of the essence lying at its basis. It\nrepresents for us earthly beauty in true heavenly radiance, the sublime\nin the highest majesty, the actually frightful in the most gruesome\nfigure, and the ridiculous in the indescribably drastic comical; and at\ntimes we are so full of one of these impressions after awakening that we\nimagine that such a thing has never been offered to us by the real\nworld.\u201d\nOne may ask, is it really the same object that the depreciating remarks\nand these inspired praises are meant for? Have the latter overlooked the\nstupid dreams and the former the thoughtful and ingenious dreams? And if\nboth kinds do occur\u2014that is, dreams that merit to be judged in this or\nthat manner\u2014does it not seem idle to seek the psychological character of\nthe dream? Would it not suffice to state that everything is possible in\nthe dream, from the lowest depreciation of the psychic life to a raising\nof the same which is unusual in the waking state? As convenient as this\nsolution would be it has this against it, that behind the efforts of all\ndream investigators, it seems to be presupposed that there is such a\ndefinable character of the dream, which is universally valid in its\nessential features and which must eliminate these contradictions.\nIt is unquestionable that the psychic capacities of the dream have found\nquicker and warmer recognition in that intellectual period which now\nlies behind us, when philosophy rather than exact natural science ruled\nintelligent minds. Utterances like those of Schubert, that the dream\nfrees the mind from the power of outer nature, that it liberates the\nsoul from the chains of the sensual, and similar opinions expressed by\nthe younger Fichte,[M] and others, who represent the dream as a soaring\nup of the psychic life to a higher stage, hardly seem conceivable to us\nto-day; they are only repeated at present by mystics and devotees. With\nthe advance of the scientific mode of thinking, a reaction took place in\nthe estimation of the dream. It is really the medical authors who are\nmost prone to underrate the psychic activity in the dream, as being\ninsignificant and invaluable, whereas, philosophers and unprofessional\nobservers\u2014amateur psychologists\u2014whose contributions in this realm can\nsurely not be overlooked, in better agreement with the popular ideas,\nhave mostly adhered to the psychic value of the dream. He who is\ninclined to underrate the psychic capacity in the dream prefers, as a\nmatter of course, the somatic exciting sources in the etiology of the\ndream; he who leaves to the dreaming mind the greater part of its\ncapacities, naturally has no reason for not also admitting independent\nstimuli for dreaming.\nAmong the superior activities which, even on sober comparison, one is\ntempted to ascribe to the dream life, memory is the most striking; we\nhave fully discussed the frequent experiences which prove this fact.\nAnother superiority of the dream life, frequently extolled by the old\nauthors, viz. that it can regard itself supreme in reference to distance\nof time and space, can be readily recognised as an illusion. This\nsuperiority, as observed by Hildebrandt,[35] is only illusional; the\ndream takes as much heed of time and space as the waking thought, and\nthis because it is only a form of thinking. The dream is supposed to\nenjoy still another advantage in reference to time; that is, it is\nindependent in still another sense of the passage of time. Dreams like\nthe guillotine dream of Maury,[48] reported above, seem to show that the\ndream can crowd together more perception content in a very short space\nof time than can be controlled by our psychic activity in the waking\nmind. These conclusions have been controverted, however, by many\narguments; the essays of Le Lorrain[45] and Egger[20] \u201cConcerning the\napparent duration of dreams\u201d gave rise to a long and interesting\ndiscussion which has probably not said the last word upon this delicate\nand far-reaching question.\nThat the dream has the ability to take up the intellectual work of the\nday and bring to a conclusion what has not been settled during the day,\nthat it can solve doubt and problems, and that it may become the source\nof new inspiration in poets and composers, seems to be indisputable, as\nis shown by many reports and by the collection compiled by\nChabaneix.[11] But even if there be no dispute as to the facts,\nnevertheless their interpretation is open in principle to a great many\ndoubts.\nFinally the asserted divinatory power of the dream forms an object of\ncontention in which hard unsurmountable reflection encounters obstinate\nand continued faith. It is indeed just that we should refrain from\ndenying all that is based on fact in this subject, as there is a\npossibility that a number of such cases may perhaps be explained on a\nnatural psychological basis.\n(_f_) _The Ethical Feelings in the Dream._\u2014For reasons which will be\nunderstood only after cognisance has been taken of my own investigations\nof the dream, I have separated from the psychology of the dream the\npartial problem whether and to what extent the moral dispositions and\nfeelings of the waking life extend into the dreams. The same\ncontradictions which we were surprised to observe in the authors\u2019\ndescriptions of all the other psychic capacities strike us again here.\nSome affirm decidedly that the dream knows nothing of moral obligations;\nothers as decidedly that the moral nature of man remains even in his\ndream life.\nA reference to our dream experience of every night seems to raise the\ncorrectness of the first assertion beyond doubt. Jessen[36] says (p.\n553): \u201cNor does one become better or more virtuous in the dream; on the\ncontrary, it seems that conscience is silent in the dream, inasmuch as\none feels no compassion and can commit the worst crimes, such as theft,\nmurder, and assassination, with perfect indifference and without\nsubsequent remorse.\u201d\nRadestock[54] (p. 146) says: \u201cIt is to be noticed that in the dream the\nassociations terminate and the ideas unite without being influenced by\nreflection and reason, \u00e6sthetic taste, and moral judgment; the judgment\nis extremely weak, and ethical indifference reigns supreme.\u201d\nVolkelt[72] (p. 23) expresses himself as follows: \u201cAs every one knows,\nthe sexual relationship in the dream is especially unbridled. Just as\nthe dreamer himself is shameless in the extreme, and wholly lacking\nmoral feeling and judgment, so also he sees others, even the most\nhonoured persons, engaged in actions which even in thought he would\nblush to associate with them in his waking state.\u201d\nUtterances like those of Schopenhauer, that in the dream every person\nacts and talks in accordance with his character, form the sharpest\ncontrast to those mentioned above. R. P. Fischer[N] maintains that the\nsubjective feelings and desires or affects and passions manifest\nthemselves in the wilfulness of the dream life, and that the moral\ncharacteristics of a person are mirrored in his dream.\nHaffner[32] (p. 25): \u201cWith rare exceptions ... a virtuous person will be\nvirtuous also in his dreams; he will resist temptation, and show no\nsympathy for hatred, envy, anger, and all other vices; while the sinful\nperson will, as a rule, also find in his dreams the pictures which he\nhas before him while awake.\u201d\nScholz[59] (p. 36): \u201cIn the dream there is truth; despite all masking in\npride or humility, we still recognise our own self.... The honest man\ndoes not commit any dishonourable offence even in the dream, or, if this\ndoes occur, he is terrified over it as if over something foreign to his\nnature. The Roman emperor who ordered one of his subjects to be executed\nbecause he dreamed that he cut off the emperor\u2019s head, was not wrong in\njustifying his action on the ground that he who has such dreams must\nhave similar thoughts while awake. About a thing that can have no place\nin our mind we therefore say significantly: \u2018I would never dream of such\na thing.\u2019\u201d\nPfaff,[O] varying a familiar proverb, says: \u201cTell me for a time your\ndreams, and I will tell you what you are within.\u201d\nThe short work of Hildebrandt,[35] from which I have already taken so\nmany quotations, a contribution to the dream problem as complete and as\nrich in thought as I found in the literature, places the problem of\nmorality in the dream as the central point of its interest. For\nHildebrandt, too, it is a strict rule that the purer the life, the purer\nthe dream; the impurer the former, the impurer the latter.\nThe moral nature of man remains even in the dream: \u201cBut while we are not\noffended nor made suspicious by an arithmetical error no matter how\nobvious, by a reversal of science no matter how romantic, or by an\nanachronism no matter how witty, we nevertheless do not lose sight of\nthe difference between good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice.\nNo matter how much of what follows us during the day may vanish in our\nhours of sleep\u2014Kant\u2019s categorical imperative sticks to our heels as an\ninseparable companion from whom we cannot rid ourselves even in\nslumber.... This can be explained, however, only by the fact that the\nfundamental in human nature, the moral essence, is too firmly fixed to\ntake part in the activity of the kaleidoscopic shaking up to which\nphantasy, reason, memory, and other faculties of the same rank succumb\nin the dream\u201d (p. 45, &c.).\nIn the further discussion of the subject we find remarkable distortion\nand inconsequence in both groups of authors. Strictly speaking, interest\nin immoral dreams would cease for all those who assert that the moral\npersonality of the person crumbles away in the dream. They could just as\ncalmly reject the attempt to hold the dreamer responsible for his\ndreams, and to draw inferences from the badness of his dreams as to an\nevil strain in his nature, as they rejected the apparently similar\nattempt to demonstrate the insignificance of his intellectual life in\nthe waking state from the absurdity of his dreams. The others for whom\n\u201cthe categorical imperative\u201d extends also into the dream, would have to\naccept full responsibility for the immoral dreams; it would only be\ndesirable for their own sake that their own objectionable dreams should\nnot lead them to abandon the otherwise firmly held estimation of their\nown morality.\nStill it seems that no one knows exactly about himself how good or how\nbad he is, and that no one can deny the recollection of his own immoral\ndreams. For besides the opposition already mentioned in the criticism of\nthe morality of the dream, both groups of authors display an effort to\nexplain the origin of the immoral dream and a new opposition is\ndeveloped, depending on whether their origin is sought in the functions\nof the psychic life or in the somatically determined injuries to this\nlife. The urgent force of the facts then permits the representatives of\nthe responsibility, as well as of the irresponsibility of the dream\nlife, to agree in the recognition of a special psychic source for the\nimmorality of dreams.\nAll those who allow the continuance of the morality in the dream\nnevertheless guard against accepting full responsibility for their\ndreams. Haffner[32] says (p. 24): \u201cWe are not responsible for dreams\nbecause the basis upon which alone our life has truth and reality is\nremoved from our thoughts.... Hence there can be no dream wishing and\ndream acting, no virtue or sin.\u201d Still the person is responsible for the\nsinful dream in so far as he brings it about indirectly. Just as in the\nwaking state, it is his duty to cleanse his moral mind, particularly so\nbefore retiring to sleep.\nThe analysis of this mixture of rejection and recognition of\nresponsibility for the moral content of the dream is followed much\nfurther by Hildebrandt. After specifying that the dramatic manner of\nrepresentation in the dream, the crowding together of the most\ncomplicated processes of deliberation in the briefest period of time,\nand the depreciation and the confusion of the presentation elements in\nthe dream admitted by him must be recognised as unfavourable to the\nimmoral aspect of dreams; he nevertheless confesses that, yielding to\nthe most earnest reflection, he is inclined simply to deny all\nresponsibility for faults and dream sins.\n(P. 49): \u201cIf we wish to reject very decisively any unjust accusation,\nespecially one that has reference to our intentions and convictions, we\nnaturally make use of the expression: I should never have dreamed of\nsuch a thing. By this we mean to say, of course, that we consider the\nrealm of the dream the last and remotest place in which we are to be\nheld responsible for our thoughts, because there these thoughts are only\nloosely and incoherently connected with our real being, so that we\nshould hardly still consider them as our own; but as we feel impelled\nexpressly to deny the existence of such thoughts, even in this realm, we\nthus at the same time indirectly admit that our justification will not\nbe complete if it does not reach to that point. And I believe that,\nthough unconsciously, we here speak the language of truth.\u201d\n(P. 52): \u201cNo dream thought can be imagined whose first motive has not\nalready moved through the mind while awake as some wish, desire, or\nimpulse.\u201d Concerning this original impulse we must say that the dream\nhas not discovered it\u2014it has only imitated and extended it, it has only\nelaborated a bit of historical material which it has found in us, into\ndramatic form; it enacts the words of the apostle: He who hates his\nbrother is a murderer. And whereas, after we awaken and become conscious\nof our moral strength, we may smile at the boldly executed structure of\nthe depraved dream, the original formative material, nevertheless, has\nno ridiculous side. One feels responsible for the transgressions of the\ndreamer, not for the whole sum, but still for a certain percentage. \u201cIn\nthis sense, which is difficult to impugn, we understand the words of\nChrist: Out of the heart come evil thoughts\u2014for we can hardly help being\nconvinced that every sin committed in the dream brings with it at least\na vague minimum of guilt.\u201d\nHildebrandt thus finds the source of the immorality of dreams in the\ngerms and indications of evil impulses which pass through our minds\nduring the day as tempting thoughts, and he sees fit to add these\nimmoral elements to the moral estimation of the personality. It is the\nsame thoughts and the same estimation of these thoughts, which, as we\nknow, have caused devout and holy men of all times to lament that they\nare evil sinners.\nThere is certainly no reason to doubt the general occurrence of these\ncontrasting presentations\u2014in most men and even also in other than\nethical spheres. The judgment of these at times has not been very\nearnest. In Spitta[64] we find the following relevant expression from A.\nZeller (Article \u201cIrre\u201d in the _Allgemeinen Encyklop\u00e4die der\nWissenschaften_ of Ersch and Gr\u00fcber, p. 144): \u201cThe mind is rarely so\nhappily organised as to possess at all times power enough not to be\ndisturbed, not only by unessential but also by perfectly ridiculous\nideas running counter to the usual clear trend of thought; indeed, the\ngreatest thinkers have had cause to complain of this dreamlike\ndisturbing and painful rabble of ideas, as it destroys their profoundest\nreflection and their most sacred and earnest mental work.\u201d\nA clearer light is thrown on the psychological status of this idea of\ncontrast by another observation of Hildebrandt, that the dream at times\nallows us to glance into the deep and inmost recesses of our being,\nwhich are generally closed to us in our waking state (p. 55). The same\nknowledge is revealed by Kant in his _Anthropology_, when he states that\nthe dream exists in order to lay bare for us our hidden dispositions and\nto reveal to us not what we are, but what we might have been if we had a\ndifferent education. Radestock[54] (p. 84) says that the dream often\nonly reveals to us what we do not wish to admit to ourselves, and that\nwe therefore unjustly condemn it as a liar and deceiver. That the\nappearance of impulses which are foreign to our consciousness is merely\nanalogous to the already familiar disposition which the dream makes of\nother material of the presentation, which is either absent or plays only\nan insignificant part in the waking state, has been called to our\nattention by observations like those of Benini,[3] who says: \u201cCerte\nnostre inclinazione che si credevano soffocate a spente da un pezzo, si\nridestano; passioni vecchie e sepolte rivivono; cose e persone a cui non\npensiamo mai, ci vengono dinanzi\u201d (p. 149). Volkelt[72] expresses\nhimself in a similar way: \u201cEven presentations which have entered into\nour consciousness almost unnoticed, and have never perhaps been brought\nout from oblivion, often announce through the dream their presence in\nthe mind\u201d (p. 105). Finally, it is not out of place to mention here\nthat, according to Schleiermacher,[61] the state of falling asleep is\naccompanied by the appearance of undesirable presentations (pictures).\nWe may comprise under \u201cundesirable presentations\u201d this entire material\nof presentations, the occurrence of which excites our wonder in immoral\nas well as in absurd dreams. The only important difference consists in\nthe fact that our undesirable presentations in the moral sphere exhibit\nan opposition to our other feelings, whereas the others simply appear\nstrange to us. Nothing has been done so far to enable us to remove this\ndifference through a more penetrating knowledge.\nBut what is the significance of the appearance of undesirable\npresentations in the dream? What inferences may be drawn for the\npsychology of the waking and dreaming mind from these nocturnal\nmanifestations of contrasting ethical impulses? We may here note a new\ndiversity of opinion, and once more a different grouping of the authors.\nThe stream of thought followed by Hildebrandt, and by others who\nrepresent his fundamental view, cannot be continued in any other way\nthan by ascribing to the immoral impulses a certain force even in the\nwaking state, which, to be sure, is inhibited from advancing to action,\nand asserting that something falls off during sleep, which, having the\neffect of an inhibition, has kept us from noticing the existence of such\nan impulse. The dream thus shows the real, if not the entire nature of\nman, and is a means of making the hidden psychic life accessible to our\nunderstanding. It is only on such assumption that Hildebrandt can\nattribute to the dream the r\u00f4le of monitor who calls our attention to\nthe moral ravages in the soul, just as in the opinion of physicians it\ncan announce a hitherto unobserved physical ailment. Spitta,[64] too,\ncannot be guided by any other conception when he refers to the stream of\nexcitement which, _e.g._, flows in upon the psyche during puberty, and\nconsoles the dreamer by saying that he has done everything in his power\nwhen he has led a strictly virtuous life during his waking state, when\nhe has made an effort to suppress the sinful thoughts as often as they\narise, and has kept them from maturing and becoming actions. According\nto this conception, we might designate the \u201cundesirable\u201d presentations\nas those that are \u201csuppressed\u201d during the day, and must recognise in\ntheir appearance a real psychic phenomenon.\nIf we followed other authors we would have no right to the last\ninference. For Jessen[36] the undesirable presentations in the dream as\nin the waking state, in fever and other deliria, merely have \u201cthe\ncharacter of a voluntary activity put to rest and a somewhat mechanical\nprocess of pictures and presentations produced by inner impulses\u201d (p.\n360). An immoral dream proves nothing for the psychic life of the\ndreamer except that he has in some way become cognizant of the ideas in\nquestion; it is surely not a psychic impulse of his own. Another author,\nMaury,[48] makes us question whether he, too, does not attribute to the\ndream state the capacity for dividing the psychic activity into its\ncomponents instead of destroying it aimlessly. He speaks as follows\nabout dreams in which one goes beyond the bounds of morality: \u201cCe sont\nnos penchants qui parlent et qui nous font agir, sans que la conscience\nnous retienne, bien que parfois elle nous avertisse. J\u2019ai mes d\u00e9fauts et\nmes penchants vicieux; \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de veille, je tache de lutter contre\neux, et il m\u2019arrive assez souvent de n\u2019y pas succomber. Mais dans mes\nsonges j\u2019y succombe toujours ou pour mieux dire j\u2019agis, par leur\nimpulsion, sans crainte et sans remords.... \u00c9videmment les visions qui\nse d\u00e9roulent devant ma pens\u00e9e et qui constituent le r\u00eave, me sont\nsugg\u00e9r\u00e9es par les incitations que je ressens et que ma volont\u00e9 absente\nne cherche pas \u00e0 refouler\u201d (p. 113).\nIf one believes in the capacity of the dream to reveal an actually\nexisting but repressed or concealed immoral disposition of the dreamer,\nhe could not emphasize his opinion more strongly than with the words of\nMaury (p. 115): \u201cEn r\u00eave l\u2019homme se r\u00e9v\u00e8le donc tout entier \u00e0 soi-m\u00eame\ndans sa nudit\u00e9 et sa mis\u00e8re natives. D\u00e8s qu\u2019il suspend l\u2019exercice de sa\nvolont\u00e9, il d\u00e9vient le jouet de toutes les passions contre lesquelles, \u00e0\nl\u2019\u00e9tat de veille, la conscience, le sentiment d\u2019honneur, la crainte nous\nd\u00e9fendent.\u201d In another place he finds the following striking words (p.\n462): \u201cDans le r\u00eave, c\u2019est surtout l\u2019homme instinctif que se r\u00e9v\u00e8le....\nL\u2019homme revient pour ainsi dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de nature quand il r\u00eave; mais\nmoins les id\u00e9es acquises ont p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 dans son esprit, plus les penchants\nen d\u00e9saccord avec elles conservent encore sur lui d\u2019influence dans le\nr\u00eave.\u201d He then mentions as an example that his dreams often show him as\na victim of just those superstitions which he most violently combats in\nhis writing.\nThe value of all these ingenious observations for a psychological\nknowledge of the dream life, however, is marred by Maury through the\nfact that he refuses to recognise in the phenomena so correctly observed\nby him any proof of the \u201cautomatisme psychologique\u201d which in his opinion\ndominates the dream life. He conceives this automatism as a perfect\ncontrast to the psychic activity.\nA passage in the studies on consciousness by Stricker[77] reads: \u201cThe\ndream does not consist of delusions merely; if, _e.g._, one is afraid of\nrobbers in the dream, the robbers are, of course, imaginary, but the\nfear is real. One\u2019s attention is thus called to the fact that the\neffective development in the dream does not admit of the judgment which\none bestows upon the rest of the dream content, and the problem arises\nwhat part of the psychic processes in the dream may be real, _i.e._ what\npart of them may demand to be enrolled among the psychic processes of\nthe waking state?\u201d\n(_g_) _Dream Theories and Functions of the Dream._\u2014A statement\nconcerning the dream which as far as possible attempts to explain from\none point of view many of its noted characters, and which at the same\ntime determines the relation of the dream to a more comprehensive sphere\nof manifestations, may be called a theory of dreams. Individual theories\nof the dream will be distinguished from one another through the fact\nthat they raise to prominence this or that characteristic of the dream,\nand connect explanations and relations with it. It will not be\nabsolutely necessary to derive from the theory a function, _i.e._ a use\nor any such activity of the dream, but our expectation, which is usually\nadjusted to teleology, will nevertheless welcome those theories which\npromise an understanding of the function of the dream.\nWe have already become acquainted with many conceptions of the dream\nwhich, more or less, merit the name of dream theories in this sense. The\nbelief of the ancients that the dream was sent by the gods in order to\nguide the actions of man was a complete theory of the dream giving\ninformation concerning everything in the dream worth knowing. Since the\ndream has become an object of biological investigation we have a greater\nnumber of theories, of which, however, some are very incomplete.\nIf we waive completeness, we may attempt the following loose grouping of\ndream theories based on their fundamental conception of the degree and\nmode of the psychic activity in the dream:\u2014\n1. Theories, like those of Delb\u0153uf,[16] which allow the full psychic\nactivity of the waking state to continue into the dream. Here the mind\ndoes not sleep; its apparatus remains intact, and, being placed under\nthe conditions different from the waking state, it must in normal\nactivity furnish results different from those of the waking state. In\nthese theories it is a question whether they are in position to derive\nthe distinctions between dreaming and waking thought altogether from the\ndeterminations of the sleeping state. They moreover lack a possible\naccess to a function of the dream; one cannot understand why one dreams,\nwhy the complicated mechanism of the psychic apparatus continues to play\neven when it is placed under conditions for which it is not apparently\nadapted. There remain only two expedient reactions\u2014to sleep dreamlessly\nor to awake when approached by disturbing stimuli\u2014instead of the third,\nthat of dreaming.\n2. Theories which, on the contrary, assume for the dream a diminution\nfor the psychic activity, a loosening of the connections, and an\nimpoverishment in available material. In accordance with these theories,\none must assume for sleep a psychological character entirely different\nfrom the one given by Delb\u0153uf. Sleep extends far beyond the mind\u2014it does\nnot consist merely in a shutting off of the mind from the outer world;\non the contrary, it penetrates into its mechanism, causing it at times\nto become useless. If I may draw a comparison from psychiatrical\nmaterial, I may say that the first theories construct the dream like a\nparanoia, while the second make it after the model of a dementia or an\namentia.\nThe theory that only a fragment of the psychic activity paralysed by\nsleep comes to expression is by far the favourite among the medical\nwriters and in the scientific world. As far as one may presuppose a more\ngeneral interest in dream interpretation, it may well be designated as\nthe ruling theory of the dream. It is to be emphasized with what\nfacility this particular theory escapes the worst rock threatening every\ndream interpretation, that is to say, being shipwrecked upon one of the\ncontrasts embodied in the dream. As this theory considers the dream the\nresult of a partial waking (or as Herbart\u2019s _Psychology_ of the dream\nsays, \u201ca gradual, partial, and at the same time very anomalous waking\u201d),\nit succeeds in covering the entire series of inferior activities in the\ndream which reveal themselves in its absurdities, up to the full\nconcentration of mental activity, by following a series of states which\nbecome more and more awake until they reach full awakening.\nOne who finds the psychological mode of expression indispensable, or who\nthinks more scientifically, will find this theory of the dream expressed\nin the discussion of Binz[4] (p. 43):\u2014\n\u201cThis state [of numbness], however, gradually approaches its end in the\nearly morning hours. The accumulated material of fatigue in the albumen\nof the brain gradually becomes less. It is gradually decomposed or\ncarried away by the constantly flowing circulation. Here and there some\nmasses of cells can be distinguished as awake, while all around\neverything still remains in a state of torpidity. _The isolated work of\nthe individual groups_ now appears before our clouded consciousness,\nwhich lacks the control of other parts of the brain governing the\nassociations. Hence the pictures created, which mostly correspond to the\nobjective impressions of the recent past, fit with each other in a wild\nand irregular manner. The number of the brain cells set free becomes\nconstantly greater, the irrationality of the dream constantly less.\u201d\nThe conception of the dream as an incomplete, partial waking state, or\ntraces of its influence, can surely be found among all modern\nphysiologists and philosophers. It is most completely represented by\nMaury.[48] It often seems as if this author represented to himself the\nstate of being awake or asleep in anatomical regions; at any rate it\nappears to him that an anatomical province is connected with a definite\npsychic function. I may here merely mention that if the theory of\npartial waking could be confirmed, there would remain much to be\naccomplished in its elaboration.\nNaturally a function of the dream cannot be found in this conception of\nthe dream life. On the contrary, the criticism of the status and\nimportance of the dream is consistently uttered in this statement of\nBinz (p. 357): \u201cAll the facts, as we see, urge us to characterise the\ndream as a physical process in all cases useless, in many cases even\nmorbid.\u201d\nThe expression \u201cphysical\u201d in reference to the dream, which owes its\nprominence to this author, points in more than one direction. In the\nfirst place, it refers to the etiology of the dream, which was\nespecially clear to Binz, as he studied the experimental production of\ndreams by the administration of poisons. It is certainly in keeping with\nthis kind of dream theory to ascribe the incitement of the dream\nexclusively to somatic origin whenever possible. Presented in the most\nextreme form, it reads as follows: After we have put ourselves to sleep\nby removing the stimuli, there would be no need and no occasion for\ndreaming until morning, when the gradual awakening through the incoming\nstimuli would be reflected in the phenomenon of dreaming. But as a\nmatter of fact, it is not possible to keep sleep free from stimuli; just\nas Mephisto complains about the germs of life, so stimuli reach the\nsleeper from every side\u2014from without, from within, and even from certain\nbodily regions which never give us any concern during the waking state.\nThus sleep is disturbed; the mind is aroused, now by this, now by that\nlittle thing, and functionates for a while with the awakened part only\nto be glad to fall asleep again. The dream is a reaction to the stimulus\ncausing a disturbance of sleep\u2014to be sure, it is a purely superfluous\nreaction.\nTo designate the dream as a physical process, which for all that remains\nan activity of the mental organ, has still another sense. It is meant to\ndispute the dignity of a psychic process for the dream. The application\nto the dream of the very old comparison of the \u201cten fingers of a\nmusically ignorant person running over the keyboard of an instrument,\u201d\nperhaps best illustrates in what estimation the dream activity has been\nheld by the representatives of exact science. In this sense it becomes\nsomething entirely untranslatable, for how could the ten fingers of an\nunmusical player produce any music?\nThe theory of partial wakefulness has not passed without objection even\nin early times. Thus Burdach,[8] in 1830, says: \u201cIf we say that the\ndream is a partial wakefulness, in the first place, we explain thereby\nneither the waking nor the sleeping state; secondly, this expresses\nnothing more than that certain forces of the mind are active in the\ndream while others are at rest. But such irregularities take place\nthroughout life....\u201d (p. 483).\nAmong extant dream theories which consider the dream a \u201cphysical\u201d\nprocess, there is one very interesting conception of the dream, first\npropounded by Robert[55] in 1866, which is attractive because it assigns\nto the dream a function or a useful end. As a basis for this theory,\nRobert takes from observation two facts which we have already discussed\nin our consideration of the dream material (see p. 13). These facts are:\nthat one very often dreams about the insignificant impressions of the\nday, and that one rarely carries over into the dream the absorbing\ninterests of the day. Robert asserts as exclusively correct, that things\nwhich have been fully settled never become dream inciters, but only such\nthings as are incomplete in the mind or touch it fleetingly (p. 11). \u201cWe\ncannot usually explain our dreams because their causes are to be found\n_in sensory impressions of the preceding day which have not attained\nsufficient recognition by the dreamer_.\u201d The conditions allowing an\nimpression to reach the dream are therefore, either that this impression\nhas been disturbed in its elaboration, or that being too insignificant\nit has no claim to such elaboration.\nRobert therefore conceives the dream \u201cas a physical process of\nelimination which has reached to cognition in the psychic manifestation\nof its reaction.\u201d _Dreams are eliminations of thoughts nipped in the\nbud._ \u201cA man deprived of the capacity for dreaming would surely in time\nbecome mentally unbalanced, because an immense number of unfinished and\nunsolved thoughts and superficial impressions would accumulate in his\nbrain, under the pressure of which there would be crushed all that\nshould be incorporated as a finished whole into memory.\u201d The dream acts\nas a safety-valve for the overburdened brain. _Dreams possess healing\nand unburdening properties_ (p. 32).\nIt would be a mistake to ask Robert how representation in the dream can\nbring about an unburdening of the mind. The author apparently concluded\nfrom those two peculiarities of the dream material that during sleep\nsuch ejection of worthless impressions is effected as a somatic process,\nand that dreaming is not a special psychic process but only the\nknowledge that we receive of such elimination. To be sure an elimination\nis not the only thing that takes place in the mind during sleep. Robert\nhimself adds that the incitements of the day are also elaborated, and\n\u201cwhat cannot be eliminated from the undigested thought material lying in\nthe mind becomes connected _by threads of thought borrowed from the\nphantasy into a finished whole_, and thus enrolled in the memory as a\nharmless phantasy picture\u201d (p. 23).\nBut it is in his criticism of the dream sources that Robert appears most\nbluntly opposed to the ruling theory. Whereas according to the existing\ntheory there would be no dream if the outer and inner sensory stimuli\ndid not repeatedly wake the mind, according to Robert the impulse to\ndream lies in the mind itself. It lies in the overcharging which demands\ndischarge, and Robert judges with perfect consistency when he maintains\nthat the causes determining the dream which depend on the physical state\nassume a subordinate rank, and could not incite dreams in a mind\ncontaining no material for dream formation taken from waking\nconsciousness. It is admitted, however, that the phantasy pictures\noriginating in the depths of the mind can be influenced by the nervous\nstimuli (p. 48). Thus, according to Robert, the dream is not quite so\ndependent on the somatic element. To be sure, it is not a psychic\nprocess, and has no place among the psychic processes of the waking\nstate; it is a nocturnal somatic process in the apparatus devoted to\nmental activity, and has a function to perform, viz. to guard this\napparatus against overstraining, or, if the comparison may be changed,\nto cleanse the mind.\nAnother author, Yves Delage,[15] bases his theory on the same\ncharacteristics of the dream, which become clear in the selection of the\ndream material, and it is instructive to observe how a slight turn in\nthe conception of the same things gives a final result of quite\ndifferent bearing.\nDelage, after having lost through death a person very dear to him, found\nfrom his own experience that we do not dream of what occupies us\nintently during the day, or that we begin to dream of it only after it\nis overshadowed by other interests of the day. His investigations among\nother persons corroborated the universality of this state of affairs.\nDelage makes a nice observation of this kind, if it turns out to be\ngenerally true, about the dreaming of newly married people: \u201cS\u2019ils ont\n\u00e9t\u00e9 fortement \u00e9pris, presque jamais ils n\u2019ont r\u00eave l\u2019un de l\u2019autre avant\nle mariage ou pendant la lune de miel; et s\u2019ils ont r\u00eave d\u2019amour c\u2019est\npour \u00eatre infid\u00e8les avec quelque personne indiff\u00e9rente ou odieuse.\u201d But\nwhat does one dream of? Delage recognises that the material occurring in\nour dreams consists of fragments and remnants of impressions from the\ndays preceding and former times. All that appears in our dreams, what at\nfirst we may be inclined to consider creations of the dream life, proves\non more thorough investigation to be unrecognised reproductions,\n\u201csouvenir inconscient.\u201d But this presentation material shows a common\ncharacter; it originates from impressions which have probably affected\nour senses more forcibly than our mind, or from which the attention has\nbeen deflected soon after their appearance. The less conscious, and at\nthe same time the stronger the impression, the more prospect it has of\nplaying a part in the next dream.\nThese are essentially the same two categories of impressions, the\ninsignificant and the unadjusted, which were emphasized by Robert,[55]\nbut Delage changes the connection by assuming that these impressions\nbecome the subject of dreams, not because they are indifferent, but\nbecause they are unadjusted. The insignificant impressions, too, are in\na way not fully adjusted; they, too, are from their nature as new\nimpressions \u201cautant de ressorts tendus,\u201d which will be relaxed during\nsleep. Still more entitled to a r\u00f4le in the dream than the weak and\nalmost unnoticed impression is a strong impression which has been\naccidentally detained in its elaboration or intentionally repressed. The\npsychic energy accumulated during the day through inhibition or\nsuppression becomes the mainspring of the dream at night.\nUnfortunately Delage stops here in his train of thought; he can ascribe\nonly the smallest part to an independent psychic activity in the dream,\nand thus in his dream theory reverts to the ruling doctrine of a partial\nsleep of the brain: \u201cEn somme le r\u00eave est le produit de la pens\u00e9e\nerrante, sans but et sans direction, se fixant successivement sur les\nsouvenirs, qui ont gard\u00e9 assez d\u2019intensit\u00e9 pour se placer sur sa route\net l\u2019arr\u00eater au passage, \u00e9tablissant entre eux un lien tant\u00f4t faible et\nind\u00e9cis, tant\u00f4t plus fort et plus serr\u00e9, selon que l\u2019activit\u00e9 actuelle\ndu cerveau est plus ou moins abolie par le sommeil.\u201d\nIn a third group we may include those dream theories which ascribe to\nthe dreaming mind the capacity and propensity for a special psychic\nactivity, which in the waking state it can accomplish either not at all\nor only in an imperfect manner. From the activity of these capacities\nthere usually results a useful function of the dream. The dignity\nbestowed upon the dream by older psychological authors falls chiefly in\nthis category. I shall content myself, however, with quoting, in their\nplace, the assertions of Burdach,[8] by virtue of which the dream \u201cis\nthe natural activity of the mind, which is not limited by the force of\nthe individuality, not disturbed by self-consciousness and not directed\nby self-determination, but is the state of life of the sensible central\npoint indulging in free play\u201d (p. 486).\nBurdach and others apparently consider this revelling in the free use of\none\u2019s own powers as a state in which the mind refreshes itself and takes\non new strength for the day work, something after the manner of a\nvacation holiday. Burdach, therefore, cites with approval the admirable\nwords in which the poet Novalis lauds the sway of the dream: \u201cThe dream\nis a bulwark against the regularity and commonness of life, a free\nrecreation of the fettered phantasy, in which it mixes together all the\npictures of life and interrupts the continued earnestness of grown-up\nmen with a joyous children\u2019s play. Without the dream we should surely\nage earlier, and thus the dream may be considered perhaps not a gift\ndirectly from above, but a delightful task, a friendly companion, on our\npilgrimage to the grave.\u201d\nThe refreshing and curative activity of the dream is even more\nimpressively depicted by Purkinje.[53] \u201cThe productive dreams in\nparticular would perform these functions. They are easy plays of the\nimagination, which have no connection with the events of the day. The\nmind does not wish to continue the tension of the waking life, but to\nrelease it and recuperate from it. It produces, in the first place,\nconditions opposed to those of the waking state. It cures sadness\nthrough joy, worry through hope and cheerfully distracting pictures,\nhatred through love and friendliness, and fear through courage and\nconfidence; it calms doubt through conviction and firm belief, and vain\nexpectations through realisation. Many sore spots in the mind, which the\nday keeps continually open, sleep heals by covering them and guarding\nagainst fresh excitement. Upon this the curative effect of time is\npartially based.\u201d We all feel that sleep is beneficial to the psychic\nlife, and the vague surmise of the popular consciousness apparently\ncannot be robbed of the notion that the dream is one of the ways in\nwhich sleep distributes its benefits.\nThe most original and most far-reaching attempt to explain the dream as\na special activity of the mind, which can freely display itself only in\nthe sleeping state, was the one undertaken by Scherner[58] in 1861.\nScherner\u2019s book, written in a heavy and bombastic style, inspired by an\nalmost intoxicated enthusiasm for the subject, which must repel us\nunless it can carry us away with it, places so many difficulties in the\nway of an analysis that we gladly resort to the clearer and shorter\ndescription in which the philosopher Volkelt[72] presents Scherner\u2019s\ntheories: \u201cFrom the mystic conglomerations and from all the gorgeous and\nmagnificent billows there indeed flashes and irradiates an ominous light\nof sense, but the path of the philosopher does not thereby become\nclearer.\u201d Such is the criticism of Scherner\u2019s description from one of\nhis own adherents.\nScherner does not belong to those authors who allow the mind to take\nalong its undiminished capacities into the dream life. He indeed\nexplains how in the dream the centrality and the spontaneous energy of\nthe ego are enervated, how cognition, feeling, will, and imagination\nbecome changed through this decentralisation, and how no true mental\ncharacter, but only the nature of a mechanism, belongs to the remnants\nof these psychic forces. But instead, the activity of the mind\ndesignated as phantasy, freed from all rational domination and hence\ncompletely uncontrolled, rises in the dream to absolute supremacy. To be\nsure, it takes the last building stones from the memory of the waking\nstate, but it builds with them constructions as different from the\nstructures of the waking state as day and night. It shows itself in the\ndream not only reproductive, but productive. Its peculiarities give to\nthe dream life its strange character. It shows a preference for the\nunlimited, exaggerated, and prodigious, but because freed from the\nimpeding thought categories, it gains a greater flexibility and agility\nand new pleasure; it is extremely sensitive to the delicate emotional\nstimuli of the mind and to the agitating affects, and it rapidly recasts\nthe inner life into the outer plastic clearness. The dream phantasy\nlacks the language of ideas; what it wishes to say, it must clearly\ndepict; and as the idea now acts strongly, it depicts it with the\nrichness, force, and immensity of the mode in question. Its language,\nhowever simple it may be, thus becomes circumstantial, cumbersome, and\nheavy. Clearness of language is rendered especially difficult by the\nfact that it shows a dislike for expressing an object by its own\npicture, but prefers a strange picture, if the latter can only express\nthat moment of the object which it wishes to describe. This is the\nsymbolising activity of the phantasy.... It is, moreover, of great\nsignificance that the dream phantasy copies objects not in detail, but\nonly in outline and even this in the broadest manner. Its paintings,\ntherefore, appear ingeniously light and graceful. The dream phantasy,\nhowever, does not stop at the mere representation of the object, but is\nimpelled from within to mingle with the object more or less of the dream\nego, and in this way to produce an action. The visual dream, _e.g._,\ndepicts gold coins in the street; the dreamer picks them up, rejoices,\nand carries them away.\nAccording to Scherner, the material upon which the dream phantasy exerts\nits artistic activity is preponderately that of the organic sensory\nstimuli which are so obscure during the day (comp. p. 29); hence the\nphantastic theory of Scherner, and the perhaps over-sober theories of\nWundt and other physiologists, though otherwise diametrically opposed,\nagree perfectly in their assumption of the dream sources and dream\nexcitants. But whereas, according to the physiological theory, the\npsychic reaction to the inner physical stimuli becomes exhausted with\nthe awakening of any ideas suitable to these stimuli, these ideas then\nby way of association calling to their aid other ideas, and with this\nstage the chain of psychic processes seeming to terminate according to\nScherner, the physical stimuli only supply the psychic force with a\nmaterial which it may render subservient to its phantastic intentions.\nFor Scherner the formation of the dream only commences where in the\nconception of others it comes to an end.\nThe treatment of the physical stimuli by the dream phantasy surely\ncannot be considered purposeful. The phantasy plays a tantalising game\nwith them, and represents the organic source which gives origin to the\nstimuli in the correspondent dream, in any plastic symbolism. Indeed\nScherner holds the opinion, not shared by Volkelt and others, that the\ndream phantasy has a certain favourite representation for the entire\norganism; this representation would be the _house_. Fortunately,\nhowever, it does not seem to limit itself in its presentation to this\nmaterial; it may also conversely employ a whole series of houses to\ndesignate a single organ, _e.g._, very long rows of houses for the\nintestinal excitation. On other occasions particular parts of the house\nactually represent particular parts of the body, as _e.g._, in the\nheadache-dream, the ceiling of the room (which the dream sees covered\nwith disgusting reptile-like spiders) represents the head.\nQuite irrespective of the house symbolism, any other suitable object may\nbe employed for the representation of these parts of the body which\nexcite the dream. \u201cThus the breathing lungs find their symbol in the\nflaming stove with its gaseous roaring, the heart in hollow boxes and\nbaskets, the bladder in round, bag-shaped, or simply hollowed objects.\nThe male dream of sexual excitement makes the dreamer find in the street\nthe upper portion of a clarinette, next to it the same part of a tobacco\npipe, and next to that a piece of fur. The clarinette and tobacco pipe\nrepresent the approximate shape of the male sexual organ, while the fur\nrepresents the pubic hair. In the female sexual dream the tightness of\nthe closely approximated thighs may be symbolised by a narrow courtyard\nsurrounded by houses, and the vagina by a very narrow, slippery and soft\nfootpath, leading through the courtyard, upon which the dreamer is\nobliged to walk, in order perhaps to carry a letter to a gentleman\u201d\n(Volkelt, p. 39). It is particularly noteworthy that at the end of such\na physically exciting dream, the phantasy, as it were, unmasks by\nrepresenting the exciting organ or its function unconcealed. Thus the\n\u201ctooth-exciting dream\u201d usually ends with the dreamer taking a tooth out\nof his mouth.\nThe dream phantasy may, however, not only direct its attention to the\nshape of the exciting organ, but it may also make the substance\ncontained therein the object of the symbolisation. Thus the dream of\nintestinal excitement, _e.g._, may lead us through muddy streets, the\nbladder-exciting dream to foaming water. Or the stimulus itself, the\nmanner of its excitation, and the object it covets, are represented\nsymbolically, or the dream ego enters into a concrete combination with\nthe symbolisation of its own state, as _e.g._, when, in the case of\npainful stimuli, we struggle desperately with vicious dogs or raging\nbulls, or when in the sexual dream the dreamer sees herself pursued by a\nnaked man. Disregarding all the possible prolixity of elaboration, a\nsymbolising phantastic activity remains as the central force of every\ndream. Volkelt,[72] in his finely and fervently written book, next\nattempted to penetrate further into the character of this phantasy and\nto assign to the psychical activity thus recognised, its position in a\nsystem of philosophical ideas, which, however, remains altogether too\ndifficult of comprehension for any one who is not prepared by previous\nschooling for the sympathetic comprehension of philosophical modes of\nthinking.\nScherner connects no useful function with the activity of the\nsymbolising phantasy in dreams. In the dream the psyche plays with the\nstimuli at its disposal. One might presume that it plays in an improper\nmanner. One might also ask us whether our thorough study of Scherner\u2019s\ndream theory, the arbitrariness and deviation of which from the rules of\nall investigation are only too obvious, can lead to any useful results.\nIt would then be proper for us to forestall the rejection of Scherner\u2019s\ntheory without examination by saying that this would be too arrogant.\nThis theory is built up on the impression received from his dreams by a\nman who paid great attention to them, and who would appear to be\npersonally very well fitted to trace obscure psychic occurrences.\nFurthermore it treats a subject which, for thousands of years, has\nappeared mysterious to humanity though rich in its contents and\nrelations; and for the elucidation of which stern science, as it\nconfesses itself, has contributed nothing beyond attempting, in entire\nopposition to popular sentiment, to deny the substance and significance\nof the object. Finally, let us frankly admit that apparently we cannot\navoid the phantastical in our attempts to elucidate the dream. There are\nalso phantastic ganglia cells; the passage cited on p. 63 from a sober\nand exact investigator like Binz,[4] which depicts how the aurora of\nawakening flows along the dormant cell masses of the cerebrum, is not\ninferior in fancifulness and in improbability to Scherner\u2019s attempts at\ninterpretation. I hope to be able to demonstrate that there is something\nactual underlying the latter, though it has only been indistinctly\nobserved and does not possess the character of universality entitling it\nto the claim of a dream theory. For the present, Scherner\u2019s theory of\nthe dream, in its contrast to the medical theory, may perhaps lead us to\nrealise between what extremes the explanation of dream life is still\nunsteadily vacillating.\n(_h_) _Relations between the Dream and Mental Diseases._\u2014When we speak\nof the relation of the dream to mental disturbances, we may think of\nthree different things: (1) Etiological and clinical relations, as when\na dream represents or initiates a psychotic condition, or when it leaves\nsuch a condition behind it. (2) Changes to which the dream life is\nsubjected in mental diseases. (3) Inner relations between the dream and\nthe psychoses, analogies indicating an intimate relationship. These\nmanifold relations between the two series of phenomena have been a\nfavourite theme of medical authors in the earlier periods of medical\nscience\u2014and again in recent times\u2014as we learn from the literature on the\nsubject gathered from Spitta,[64] Radestock,[54] Maury,[48] and\nTissi\u00e9.[68] Sante de Sanctis has lately directed his attention to this\nrelationship. For the purposes of our discussion it will suffice merely\nto glance at this important subject.\nIn regard to the clinical and etiological relations between the dream\nand the psychoses, I will report the following observations as\nparadigms. Hohnbaum asserts (see Krauss, p. 39), that the first attack\nof insanity frequently originates in an anxious and terrifying dream,\nand that the ruling idea has connection with this dream. Sante de\nSanctis adduces similar observations in paranoiacs, and declares the\ndream to be, in some of them, the \u201cvraie cause d\u00e9terminante de la\nfolie.\u201d The psychosis may come to life all of a sudden with the dream\ncausing and containing the explanation for the mental disturbances, or\nit may slowly develop through further dreams that have yet to struggle\nagainst doubt. In one of de Sanctis\u2019s cases, the affecting dream was\naccompanied by light hysterical attacks, which in their turn were\nfollowed by an anxious, melancholic state. F\u00e9r\u00e9 (cited by Tissi\u00e9) refers\nto a dream which caused an hysterical paralysis. Here the dream is\noffered us as an etiology of mental disturbance, though we equally\nconsider the prevailing conditions when we declare that the mental\ndisturbance shows its first manifestation in dream life, that it has its\nfirst outbreak in the dream. In other instances the dream life contained\nthe morbid symptoms, or the psychosis was limited to the dream life.\nThus Thomayer[70] calls attention to anxiety dreams which must be\nconceived as equivalent to epileptic attacks. Allison has described\nnocturnal insanity (cited by Radestock), in which the subjects are\napparently perfectly well in the day-time, while hallucinations, fits of\nfrenzy, and the like regularly appear at night. De Sanctis and Tissi\u00e9\nreport similar observations (paranoiac dream-equivalent in an alcoholic,\nvoices accusing a wife of infidelity). Tissi\u00e9 reports abundant\nobservations from recent times in which actions of a pathological\ncharacter (based on delusions, obsessive impulses) had their origin in\ndreams. Guislain describes a case in which sleep was replaced by an\nintermittent insanity.\nThere is hardly any doubt that along with the psychology of the dream,\nthe physician will one day occupy himself with the psychopathology of\nthe dream.\nIn cases of convalescence from insanity, it is often especially obvious\nthat, while the functions of the day are normal, the dream life may\nstill belong to the psychosis. Gregory is said first to have called\nattention to such cases (cited by Krauss[39]). Macario (reported by\nTissi\u00e9) gives account of a maniac who, a week after his complete\nrecovery again experienced in dreams the flight of ideas and the\npassionate impulses of his disease.\nConcerning the changes to which the dream life is subjected in chronic\npsychotic persons, very few investigations have so far been made. On the\nother hand, timely attention has been called to the inner relationship\nbetween the dream and mental disturbance, which shows itself in an\nextensive agreement of the manifestations occurring to both. According\nto Maury,[47] Cubanis, in his _Rapports du physique et du moral_, first\ncalled attention to this; following him came Lelut, J. Moreau, and more\nparticularly the philosopher Maine de Biran. To be sure, the comparison\nis still older. Radestock[54] begins the chapter dealing with this\ncomparison, by giving a collection of expressions showing the analogy\nbetween the dream and insanity. Kant somewhere says: \u201cThe lunatic is a\ndreamer in the waking state.\u201d According to Krauss \u201cInsanity is a dream\nwith the senses awake.\u201d Schopenhauer terms the dream a short insanity,\nand insanity a long dream. Hagen describes the delirium as dream life\nwhich has not been caused by sleep but by disease. Wundt, in the\n_Physiological Psychology_, declares: \u201cAs a matter of fact we may in the\ndream ourselves live through almost all symptoms which we meet in the\ninsane asylums.\u201d\nThe specific agreements, on the basis of which such an identification\ncommends itself to the understanding, are enumerated by Spitta.[64] And\nindeed, very similarly, by Maury in the following grouping: \u201c(1)\nSuspension or at least retardation, of self-consciousness, consequent\nignorance of the condition as such, and hence incapability of\nastonishment and lack of moral consciousness. (2) Modified perception of\nthe sensory organs; that is, perception is diminished in the dream and\ngenerally enhanced in insanity. (3) Combination of ideas with each other\nexclusively in accordance with the laws of association and of\nreproduction, hence automatic formation of groups and for this reason\ndisproportion in the relations between ideas (exaggerations, phantasms).\nAnd as a result of all this: (4) Changing or transformation of the\npersonality and at times of the peculiarities of character\n(perversities).\u201d\nRadestock gives some additional features or analogies in the material:\n\u201cMost hallucinations and illusions are found in the sphere of the senses\nof sight and hearing and general sensation. As in the dream, the\nsmallest number of elements is supplied by the senses of smell and\ntaste. The fever patient, like the dreamer, is assaulted by\nreminiscences from the remote past; what the waking and healthy man\nseems to have forgotten is recollected in sleep and in disease.\u201d The\nanalogy between the dream and the psychosis receives its full value only\nwhen, like a family resemblance, it is extended to the finer mimicry and\nto the individual peculiarities of facial expression.\n\u201cTo him who is tortured by physical and mental sufferings the dream\naccords what has been denied him by reality, to wit, physical well-being\nand happiness; so the insane, too, see the bright pictures of happiness,\ngreatness, sublimity, and riches. The supposed possession of estates and\nthe imaginary fulfilment of wishes, the denial or destruction of which\nhave just served as a psychic cause of the insanity, often form the main\ncontent of the delirium. The woman who has lost a dearly beloved child,\nin her delirium experiences maternal joys; the man who has suffered\nreverses of fortune deems himself immensely wealthy; and the jilted girl\npictures herself in the bliss of tender love.\u201d\nThe above passage from Radestock, an abstract of a keen discussion of\nGriesinger[31] (p. 111), reveals with the greatest clearness the wish\nfulfilment as a characteristic of the imagination, common to the dream\nand the psychosis. (My own investigations have taught me that here the\nkey to a psychological theory of the dream and of the psychosis is to be\nfound.)\n\u201cAbsurd combinations of ideas and weakness of judgment are the main\ncharacteristics of the dream and of insanity.\u201d The over-estimation of\none\u2019s own mental capacity, which appears absurd to sober judgment, is\nfound alike both in one and the other, and the rapid course of ideas in\nthe dream corresponds to the flight of ideas in the psychosis. Both are\ndevoid of any measure of time. The dissociation of personality in the\ndream, which, for instance, distributes one\u2019s own knowledge between two\npersons, one of whom, the strange one, corrects in the dream one\u2019s own\nego, fully corresponds to the well-known splitting of personality in\nhallucinatory paranoia; the dreamer, too, hears his own thoughts\nexpressed by strange voices. Even the constant delusions find their\nanalogy in the stereotyped recurring pathological dreams (_r\u00eave\nobs\u00e9dant_). After recovering from a delirium, patients not infrequently\ndeclare that the disease appeared to them like an uncomfortable dream;\nindeed, they inform us that occasionally, even during the course of\ntheir sickness, they have felt that they were only dreaming, just as it\nfrequently happens in the sleeping dream.\nConsidering all this, it is not surprising that Radestock condenses his\nown opinion and that of many others into the following: \u201cInsanity, an\nabnormal phenomenon of disease, is to be regarded as an enhancement of\nthe periodically recurring normal dream states\u201d (p. 228).\nKrauss[39] attempted to base the relationship between the dream and\ninsanity upon the etiology (or rather upon the exciting sources),\nperhaps making the relationship even more intimate than was possible\nthrough the analogy of the phenomena they manifest. According to him,\nthe fundamental element common to both is, as we have learned, the\norganically determined sensation, the sensation of physical stimuli, the\ngeneral feeling produced by contributions from all the organs. _Cf._\nPeise, cited by Maury[48] (p. 60).\nThe incontestable agreement between the dream and mental disturbance,\nextending into characteristic details, constitutes one of the strongest\nsupports of the medical theory of dream life, according to which the\ndream is represented as a useless and disturbing process and as the\nexpression of a reduced psychic activity. One cannot expect, however, to\nderive the final explanation of the dream from the mental disturbances,\nas it is generally known in what unsatisfactory state our understanding\nof the origin of the latter remains. It is very probably, however, that\na modified conception of the dream must also influence our views in\nregard to the inner mechanism of mental disturbances, and hence we may\nsay that we are engaged in the elucidation of the psychosis when we\nendeavour to clear up the mystery of the dream.\nI shall have to justify myself for not extending my summary of the\nliterature of the dream problems over the period between the first\nappearance of this book and its second edition. If this justification\nmay not seem very satisfactory to the reader, I was nevertheless\ninfluenced by it. The motives which mainly induced me to summarise the\ntreatment of the dream in the literature have been exhausted with the\nforegoing introduction; to have continued with this work would have cost\nme extraordinary effort and would have afforded little advantage or\nknowledge. For the period of nine years referred to has yielded nothing\nnew or valuable either for the conception of the dream in actual\nmaterial or in points of view. In most of the publications that have\nsince appeared my work has remained unmentioned and unregarded;\nnaturally least attention has been bestowed upon it by the so-called\n\u201cinvestigators of dreams,\u201d who have thus afforded a splendid example of\nthe aversion characteristic of scientific men to learning something new.\n\u201cLes savants ne sont pas curieux,\u201d said the scoffer Anatole France. If\nthere were such a thing in science as right to revenge, I in turn should\nbe justified in ignoring the literature since the appearance of this\nbook. The few accounts that have appeared in scientific journals are so\nfull of folly and misconception that my only possible answer to my\ncritics would be to request them to read this book over again. Perhaps\nalso the request should be that they read it as a whole.\nIn the works of those physicians who make use of the psychoanalytic\nmethod of treatment (Jung, Abraham, Riklin, Muthmann, Stekel, Rank, and\nothers), an abundance of dreams have been reported and interpreted in\naccordance with my instructions. In so far as these works go beyond the\nconfirmation of my assertions I have noted their results in the context\nof my discussion. A supplement to the literary index at the end of this\nbook brings together the most important of these new publications. The\nvoluminous book on the dream by Sante de Sanctis, of which a German\ntranslation appeared soon after its publication, has, so to speak,\ncrossed with mine, so that I could take as little notice of him as the\nItalian author could of me. Unfortunately, I am further obliged to\ndeclare that this laborious work is exceedingly poor in ideas, so poor\nthat one could never divine from it the existence of the problems\ntreated by me.\nI have finally to mention two publications which show a near relation to\nmy treatment of the dream problems. A younger philosopher, H. Swoboda,\nwho has undertaken to extend W. Fliesse\u2019s discovery of biological\nperiodicity (in groups of twenty-three and twenty-eight days) to the\npsychic field, has produced an imaginative work,[P] in which, among\nother things, he has used this key to solve the riddle of the dream. The\ninterpretation of dreams would herein have fared badly; the material\ncontained in dreams would be explained through the coincidence of all\nthose memories which during the night complete one of the biological\nperiods for the first or the n-th time. A personal statement from the\nauthor led me to assume that he himself no longer wished to advocate\nthis theory earnestly. But it seems I was mistaken in this conclusion; I\nshall report in another place some observations in reference to\nSwoboda\u2019s assertion, concerning the conclusions of which I am, however,\nnot convinced. It gave me far greater pleasure to find accidentally, in\nan unexpected place, a conception of the dream in essentials fully\nagreeing with my own. The circumstances of time preclude the possibility\nthat this conception was influenced by a reading of my book; I must\ntherefore greet this as the only demonstrable concurrence in the\nliterature with the essence of my dream theory. The book which contains\nthe passage concerning the dream which I have in mind was published as a\nsecond edition in 1900 by Lynkus under the title _Phantasien eines\nRealisten_.\nII\nMETHOD OF DREAM INTERPRETATION\nTHE ANALYSIS OF A SAMPLE DREAM\nThe title which I have given my treatise indicates the tradition which I\nwish to make the starting-point in my discussion of dreams. I have made\nit my task to show that dreams are capable of interpretation, and\ncontributions to the solution of the dream problems that have just been\ntreated can only be yielded as possible by-products of the settlement of\nmy own particular problem. With the hypothesis that dreams are\ninterpretable, I at once come into contradiction with the prevailing\ndream science, in fact with all dream theories except that of Scherner,\nfor to \u201cinterpret a dream\u201d means to declare its meaning, to replace it\nby something which takes its place in the concatenation of our psychic\nactivities as a link of full importance and value. But, as we have\nlearnt, the scientific theories of the dream leave no room for a problem\nof dream interpretation, for, in the first place, according to these,\nthe dream is no psychic action, but a somatic process which makes itself\nknown to the psychic apparatus by means of signs. The opinion of the\nmasses has always been quite different. It asserts its privilege of\nproceeding illogically, and although it admits the dream to be\nincomprehensible and absurd, it cannot summon the resolution to deny the\ndream all significance. Led by a dim intuition, it seems rather to\nassume that the dream has a meaning, albeit a hidden one; that it is\nintended as a substitute for some other thought process, and that it is\nonly a question of revealing this substitute correctly in order to reach\nthe hidden signification of the dream.\nThe laity has, therefore, always endeavoured to \u201cinterpret\u201d the dream,\nand in doing so has tried two essentially different methods. The first\nof these procedures regards the dream content as a whole and seeks to\nreplace it by another content which is intelligible and in certain\nrespects analogous. This is symbolic dream interpretation; it naturally\ngoes to pieces at the outset in the case of those dreams which appear\nnot only unintelligible but confused. The construction which the\nbiblical Joseph places upon the dream of Pharaoh furnishes an example of\nits procedure. The seven fat kine, after which came seven lean ones\nwhich devour the former, furnish a symbolic substitute for a prediction\nof seven years of famine in the land of Egypt, which will consume all\nthe excess which seven fruitful years have created. Most of the\nartificial dreams contrived by poets are intended for such symbolic\ninterpretation, for they reproduce the thought conceived by the poet in\na disguise found to be in accordance with the characteristics of our\ndreaming, as we know these from experience.[Q] The idea that the dream\nconcerns itself chiefly with future events whose course it surmises in\nadvance\u2014a relic of the prophetic significance with which dreams were\nonce credited\u2014now becomes the motive for transplanting the meaning of\nthe dream, found by means of symbolic interpretation, into the future by\nmeans of an \u201cit shall.\u201d\nA demonstration of the way in which such symbolic interpretation is\narrived at cannot, of course, be given. Success remains a matter of\ningenious conjecture, of direct intuition, and for this reason dream\ninterpretation has naturally been elevated to an art, which seems to\ndepend upon extraordinary gifts.[R] The other of the two popular methods\nof dream interpretation entirely abandons such claims. It might be\ndesignated as the \u201ccipher method,\u201d since it treats the dream as a kind\nof secret code, in which every sign is translated into another sign of\nknown meaning, according to an established key. For example, I have\ndreamt of a letter, and also of a funeral or the like; I consult a\n\u201cdream book,\u201d and find that \u201cletter\u201d is to be translated by \u201cvexation,\u201d\nand \u201cfuneral\u201d by \u201cmarriage, engagement.\u201d It now remains to establish a\nconnection, which I again am to assume pertains to the future, by means\nof the rigmarole which I have deciphered. An interesting variation of\nthis cipher procedure, a variation by which its character of purely\nmechanical transference is to a certain extent corrected, is presented\nin the work on dream interpretation by Artemidoros of Daldis.[2] Here\nnot only the dream content, but also the personality and station in life\nof the dreamer, are taken into consideration, so that the same dream\ncontent has a significance for the rich man, the married man, or the\norator, which is different from that for the poor man, the unmarried\nman, or, say, the merchant. The essential point, then, in this procedure\nis that the work of interpretation is not directed to the entirety of\nthe dream, but to each portion of the dream content by itself, as though\nthe dream were a conglomeration, in which each fragment demands a\nparticular disposal. Incoherent and confused dreams are certainly the\nones responsible for the invention of the cipher method.[S]\nThe worthlessness of both these popular interpretation procedures for\nthe scientific treatment of the subject cannot be questioned for a\nmoment. The symbolic method is limited in its application and is capable\nof no general demonstration. In the cipher method everything depends\nupon whether the key, the dream book, is reliable, and for that all\nguarantees are lacking. One might be tempted to grant the contention of\nthe philosophers and psychiatrists and to dismiss the problem of dream\ninterpretation as a fanciful one.\nI have come, however, to think differently. I have been forced to admit\nthat here once more we have one of those not infrequent cases where an\nancient and stubbornly retained popular belief seems to have come nearer\nto the truth of the matter than the judgment of the science which\nprevails to-day. I must insist that the dream actually has significance,\nand that a scientific procedure in dream interpretation is possible. I\nhave come upon the knowledge of this procedure in the following manner:\u2014\nFor several years I have been occupied with the solution of certain\npsychopathological structures in hysterical phobias, compulsive ideas,\nand the like, for therapeutic purposes. I have been so occupied since\nbecoming familiar with an important report of Joseph Breuer to the\neffect that in those structures, regarded as morbid symptoms, solution\nand treatment go hand in hand.[T] Where it has been possible to trace\nsuch a pathological idea back to the elements in the psychic life of the\npatient to which it owes its origin, this idea has crumbled away, and\nthe patient has been relieved of it. In view of the failure of our other\ntherapeutic efforts, and in the face of the mysteriousness of these\nconditions, it seems to me tempting, in spite of all difficulties, to\npress forward on the path taken by Breuer until the subject has been\nfully understood. We shall have elsewhere to make a detailed report upon\nthe form which the technique of this procedure has finally assumed, and\nthe results of the efforts which have been made. In the course of these\npsychoanalytical studies, I happened upon dream interpretation. My\npatients, after I had obliged them to inform me of all the ideas and\nthoughts which came to them in connection with the given theme, related\ntheir dreams, and thus taught me that a dream may be linked into the\npsychic concatenation which must be followed backwards into the memory\nfrom the pathological idea as a starting-point. The next step was to\ntreat the dream as a symptom, and to apply to it the method of\ninterpretation which had been worked out for such symptoms.\nFor this a certain psychic preparation of the patient is necessary. The\ndouble effort is made with him, to stimulate his attention for his\npsychic perceptions and to eliminate the critique with which he is\nordinarily in the habit of viewing the thoughts which come to the\nsurface in him. For the purpose of self-observation with concentrated\nattention, it is advantageous that the patient occupy a restful position\nand close his eyes; he must be explicitly commanded to resign the\ncritique of the thought-formations which he perceives. He must be told\nfurther that the success of the psychoanalysis depends upon his noticing\nand telling everything that passes through his mind, and that he must\nnot allow himself to suppress one idea because it seems to him\nunimportant or irrelevant to the subject, or another because it seems\nnonsensical. He must maintain impartiality towards his ideas; for it\nwould be owing to just this critique if he were unsuccessful in finding\nthe desired solution of the dream, the obsession, or the like.\nI have noticed in the course of my psychoanalytic work that the state of\nmind of a man in contemplation is entirely different from that of a man\nwho is observing his psychic processes. In contemplation there is a\ngreater play of psychic action than in the most attentive\nself-observation; this is also shown by the tense attitude and wrinkled\nbrow of contemplation, in contrast with the restful features of\nself-observation. In both cases, there must be concentration of\nattention, but, besides this, in contemplation one exercises a critique,\nin consequence of which he rejects some of the ideas which he has\nperceived, and cuts short others, so that he does not follow the trains\nof thought which they would open; toward still other thoughts he may act\nin such a manner that they do not become conscious at all\u2014that is to\nsay, they are suppressed before they are perceived. In self-observation,\non the other hand, one has only the task of suppressing the critique; if\nhe succeeds in this, an unlimited number of ideas, which otherwise would\nhave been impossible for him to grasp, come to his consciousness. With\nthe aid of this material, newly secured for the purpose of\nself-observation, the interpretation of pathological ideas, as well as\nof dream images, can be accomplished. As may be seen, the point is to\nbring about a psychic state to some extent analogous as regards the\napportionment of psychic energy (transferable attention) to the state\nprior to falling asleep (and indeed also to the hypnotic state). In\nfalling asleep, the \u201cundesired ideas\u201d come into prominence on account of\nthe slackening of a certain arbitrary (and certainly also critical)\naction, which we allow to exert an influence upon the trend of our\nideas; we are accustomed to assign \u201cfatigue\u201d as the reason for this\nslackening; the emerging undesired ideas as the reason are changed into\nvisual and acoustic images. (_Cf._ the remarks of Schleiermacher[61] and\nothers, p. 40.) In the condition which is used for the analysis of\ndreams and pathological ideas, this activity is purposely and\narbitrarily dispensed with, and the psychic energy thus saved, or a part\nof it, is used for the attentive following of the undesired thoughts now\ncoming to the surface, which retain their identity as ideas (this is the\ndifference from the condition of falling asleep). \u201cUndesired ideas\u201d are\nthus changed into \u201cdesired\u201d ones.\nThe suspension thus required of the critique for these apparently\n\u201cfreely rising\u201d ideas, which is here demanded and which is usually\nexercised on them, is not easy for some persons. The \u201cundesired ideas\u201d\nare in the habit of starting the most violent resistance, which seeks to\nprevent them from coming to the surface. But if we may credit our great\npoet-philosopher Friedrich Schiller, a very similar tolerance must be\nthe condition of poetic production. At a point in his correspondence\nwith Koerner, for the noting of which we are indebted to Mr. Otto Rank,\nSchiller answers a friend who complains of his lack of creativeness in\nthe following words: \u201cThe reason for your complaint lies, it seems to\nme, in the constraint which your intelligence imposes upon your\nimagination. I must here make an observation and illustrate it by an\nallegory. It does not seem beneficial, and it is harmful for the\ncreative work of the mind, if the intelligence inspects too closely the\nideas already pouring in, as it were, at the gates. Regarded by itself,\nan idea may be very trifling and very adventurous, but it perhaps\nbecomes important on account of one which follows it; perhaps in a\ncertain connection with others, which may seem equally absurd, it is\ncapable of forming a very useful construction. The intelligence cannot\njudge all these things if it does not hold them steadily long enough to\nsee them in connection with the others. In the case of a creative mind,\nhowever, the intelligence has withdrawn its watchers from the gates, the\nideas rush in pell-mell, and it is only then that the great heap is\nlooked over and critically examined. Messrs. Critics, or whatever else\nyou may call yourselves, you are ashamed or afraid of the momentary and\ntransitory madness which is found in all creators, and whose longer or\nshorter duration distinguishes the thinking artist from the dreamer.\nHence your complaints about barrenness, for you reject too soon and\ndiscriminate too severely\u201d (Letter of December 1, 1788).\nAnd yet, \u201csuch a withdrawal of the watchers from the gates of\nintelligence,\u201d as Schiller calls it, such a shifting into the condition\nof uncritical self-observation, is in no way difficult.\nMost of my patients accomplish it after the first instructions; I myself\ncan do it very perfectly, if I assist the operation by writing down my\nnotions. The amount, in terms of psychic energy, by which the critical\nactivity is in this manner reduced, and by which the intensity of the\nself-observation may be increased, varies widely according to the\nsubject matter upon which the attention is to be fixed.\nThe first step in the application of this procedure now teaches us that\nnot the dream as a whole, but only the parts of its contents separately,\nmay be made the object of our attention. If I ask a patient who is as\nyet unpractised: \u201cWhat occurs to you in connection with this dream?\u201d as\na rule he is unable to fix upon anything in his psychic field of vision.\nI must present the dream to him piece by piece, then for every fragment\nhe gives me a series of notions, which may be designated as the\n\u201cbackground thoughts\u201d of this part of the dream. In this first and\nimportant condition, then, the method of dream interpretation which I\nemploy avoids the popular, traditional method of interpretation by\nsymbolism famous in the legends, and approaches the second, the \u201ccipher\nmethod.\u201d Like this one it is an interpretation in detail, not _en\nmasse_; like this it treats the dream from the beginning as something\nput together\u2014as a conglomeration of psychic images.\nIn the course of my psychoanalysis of neurotics, I have indeed already\nsubjected many thousand dreams to interpretation, but I do not now wish\nto use this material in the introduction to the technique and theory of\ndream interpretation. Quite apart from the consideration that I should\nexpose myself to the objection that these are dreams of neuropathic\nsubjects, the conclusions drawn from which would not admit of\nreapplication to the dreams of healthy persons, another reason forces me\nto reject them. The theme which is naturally always the subject of these\ndreams, is the history of the disease which is responsible for the\nneurosis. For this purpose there would be required a very long\nintroduction and an investigation into the nature and logical conditions\nof psychoneuroses, things which are in themselves novel and unfamiliar\nin the highest degree, and which would thus distract attention from the\ndream problem. My purpose lies much more in the direction of preparing\nthe ground for a solution of difficult problems in the psychology of the\nneuroses by means of the solution of dreams. But if I eliminate the\ndreams of neurotics, I must not treat the remainder too\ndiscriminatingly. Only those dreams still remain which have been\noccasionally related to me by healthy persons of my acquaintance, or\nwhich I find as examples in the literature of dream life. Unfortunately\nin all these dreams the analysis is lacking, without which I cannot find\nthe meaning of the dream. My procedure is, of course, not as easy as\nthat of the popular cipher method, which translates the given dream\ncontent according to an established key; I am much more prepared to find\nthat the same dream may cover a different meaning in the case of\ndifferent persons, and in a different connection I must then resort to\nmy own dreams, as an abundant and convenient material, furnished by a\nperson who is about normal, and having reference to many incidents of\neveryday life. I shall certainly be with doubts as to the\ntrustworthiness of these \u201cself-analyses.\u201d Arbitrariness is here in no\nway avoided. In my opinion, conditions are more likely to be favourable\nin self-observation than in the observation of others; in any case, it\nis permissible to see how much can be accomplished by means of\nself-analysis. I must overcome further difficulties arising from inner\nself. One has a readily understood aversion to exposing so many intimate\nthings from one\u2019s own psychic life, and one does not feel safe from the\nmisinterpretation of strangers. But one must be able to put one\u2019s self\nbeyond this. \u201cToute psychologiste,\u201d writes Delb\u0153uf,[26] \u201cest oblig\u00e9 de\nfaire l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de ses faiblesses s\u2019il croit par l\u00e0 jeter du jour sur\nquelque probl\u00e8me obscure.\u201d And I may assume that in the case of the\nreader, the immediate interest in the indiscretions which I must commit\nwill very soon give way to exclusive engrossment in the psychological\nproblems which are illuminated by them.\nI shall, therefore, select one of my own dreams and use it to elucidate\nmy method of interpretation. Every such dream necessitates a preliminary\nstatement. I must now beg the reader to make my interests his own for a\nconsiderable time, and to become absorbed with me in the most trifling\ndetails of my life, for an interest in the hidden significance of dreams\nimperatively demands such transference.\nPreliminary statement: In the summer of 1895 I had psychoanalytically\ntreated a young lady who stood in close friendship to me and those near\nto me. It is to be understood that such a complication of relations may\nbe the source of manifold feelings for the physician, especially for the\npsychotherapist. The personal interest of the physician is greater, his\nauthority is less. A failure threatens to undermine the friendship with\nthe relatives of the patient. The cure ended with partial success, the\npatient got rid of her hysterical fear, but not of all her somatic\nsymptoms. I was at that time not yet sure of the criteria marking the\nfinal settlement of a hysterical case, and expected her to accept a\nsolution which did not seem acceptable to her. In this disagreement, we\ncut short the treatment on account of the summer season. One day a\nyounger colleague, one of my best friends, who had visited the\npatient\u2014Irma\u2014and her family in their country resort, came to see me. I\nasked him how he found her, and received the answer: \u201cShe is better, but\nnot altogether well.\u201d I realise that those words of my friend Otto, or\nthe tone of voice in which they were spoken, made me angry. I thought I\nheard a reproach in the words, perhaps to the effect that I had promised\nthe patient too much, and rightly or wrongly I traced Otto\u2019s supposed\nsiding against me to the influence of the relatives of the patient, who,\nI assume, had never approved of my treatment. Moreover, my disagreeable\nimpression did not become clear to me, nor did I give it expression. The\nvery same evening, I wrote down the history of Irma\u2019s case, in order to\nhand it, as though for my justification, to Dr. M., a mutual friend, who\nwas at that time a leading figure in our circle. During the night\nfollowing this evening (perhaps rather in the morning) I had the\nfollowing dream, which was registered immediately after waking:\u2014\nDREAM OF JULY 23\u201324, 1895\n_A great hall\u2014many guests whom we are receiving\u2014among them Irma, whom I\nimmediately take aside, as though to answer her letter, to reproach her\nfor not yet accepting the \u201csolution.\u201d I say to her: \u201cIf you still have\npains, it is really only your own fault.\u201d She answers: \u201cIf you only knew\nwhat pains I now have in the neck, stomach, and abdomen; I am drawn\ntogether.\u201d I am frightened and look at her. She looks pale and bloated;\nI think that after all I must be overlooking some organic affection. I\ntake her to the window and look into her throat. She shows some\nresistance to this, like a woman who has a false set of teeth. I think\nanyway she does not need them. The mouth then really opens without\ndifficulty and I find a large white spot to the right, and at another\nplace I see extended grayish-white scabs attached to curious curling\nformations, which have obviously been formed like the turbinated bone\u2014I\nquickly call Dr. M., who repeats the examination and confirms it.... Dr.\nM.\u2019s looks are altogether unusual; he is very pale, limps, and has no\nbeard on his chin.... My friend Otto is now also standing next to her,\nand my friend Leopold percusses her small body and says: \u201cShe has some\ndulness on the left below,\u201d and also calls attention to an infiltrated\nportion of the skin on the left shoulder (something which I feel as he\ndoes, in spite of the dress).... M. says: \u201cNo doubt it is an infection,\nbut it does not matter; dysentery will develop too, and the poison will\nbe excreted.... We also have immediate knowledge of the origin of the\ninfection. My friend Otto has recently given her an injection with a\npropyl preparation when she felt ill, propyls.... Propionic acid ...\nTrimethylamine (the formula of which I see printed before me in heavy\ntype).... Such injections are not made so rashly.... Probably also the\nsyringe was not clean.\u201d_\nThis dream has an advantage over many others. It is at once clear with\nwhat events of the preceding day it is connected, and what subject it\ntreats. The preliminary statement gives information on these points. The\nnews about Irma\u2019s health which I have received from Otto, the history of\nthe illness upon which I have written until late at night, have occupied\nmy psychic activity even during sleep. In spite of all this, no one, who\nhas read the preliminary report and has knowledge of the content of the\ndream, has been able to guess what the dream signifies. Nor do I myself\nknow. I wonder about the morbid symptoms, of which Irma complains in the\ndream, for they are not the same ones for which I have treated her. I\nsmile about the consultation with Dr. M. I smile at the nonsensical idea\nof an injection with propionic acid, and at the consolation attempted by\nDr. M. Towards the end the dream seems more obscure and more terse than\nat the beginning. In order to learn the significance of all this, I am\ncompelled to undertake a thorough analysis.\nANALYSIS\n_The hall\u2014many guests, whom we are receiving._\nWe were living this summer at the Bellevue, in an isolated house on one\nof the hills which lie close to the Kahlenberg. This house was once\nintended as a place of amusement, and on this account has unusually\nhigh, hall-like rooms. The dream also occurred at the Bellevue, a few\ndays before the birthday of my wife. During the day, my wife had\nexpressed the expectation that several friends, among them Irma, would\ncome to us as guests for her birthday. My dream, then, anticipates this\nsituation: It is the birthday of my wife, and many people, among them\nIrma, are received by us as guests in the great hall of the Bellevue.\n_I reproach Irma for not having accepted the solution. I say: \u201cIf you\nstill have pains, it is your own fault.\u201d_\nI might have said this also, or did say it, while awake. At that time I\nhad the opinion (recognised later to be incorrect) that my task was\nlimited to informing patients of the hidden meaning of their symptoms.\nWhether they then accepted or did not accept the solution upon which\nsuccess depended\u2014for that I was not responsible. I am thankful to this\nerror, which fortunately has now been overcome, for making life easier\nfor me at a time when, with all my unavoidable ignorance, I was to\nproduce successful cures. But I see in the speech which I make to Irma\nin the dream, that above all things I do not want to be to blame for the\npains which she still feels. If it is Irma\u2019s own fault, it cannot be\nmine. Should the purpose of the dream be looked for in this quarter?\n_Irma\u2019s complaints; pains in the neck, abdomen, and stomach; she is\ndrawn together._\nPains in the stomach belonged to the symptom-complex of my patient, but\nthey were not very prominent; she complained rather of sensations of\nnausea and disgust. Pains in the neck and abdomen and constriction of\nthe throat hardly played a part in her case. I wonder why I decided upon\nthis choice of symptoms, nor can I for the moment find the reason.\n_She looks pale and bloated._\nMy patient was always ruddy. I suspect that another person is here being\nsubstituted for her.\n_I am frightened at the thought that I must have overlooked some organic\naffection._\nThis, as the reader will readily believe, is a constant fear with the\nspecialist, who sees neurotics almost exclusively, and who is accustomed\nto ascribe so many manifestations, which other physicians treat as\norganic, to hysteria. On the other hand, I am haunted by a faint doubt\u2014I\nknow not whence it comes\u2014as to whether my fear is altogether honest. If\nIrma\u2019s pains are indeed of organic origin, I am not bound to cure them.\nMy treatment, of course, removes only hysterical pains. It seems to me,\nin fact, that I wish to find an error in the diagnosis; in that case the\nreproach of being unsuccessful would be removed.\n_I take her to the window in order to look into her throat. She resists\na little, like a woman who has false teeth. I think she does not need\nthem anyway._\nI had never had occasion to inspect Irma\u2019s aural cavity. The incident in\nthe dream reminds me of an examination, made some time before, of a\ngoverness who at first gave an impression of youthful beauty, but who\nupon opening her mouth took certain measures for concealing her teeth.\nOther memories of medical examinations and of little secrets which are\ndiscovered by them, unpleasantly for both examiner and examined, connect\nthemselves with this case. \u201cShe does not need them anyway,\u201d is at first\nperhaps a compliment for Irma; but I suspect a different meaning. In\ncareful analysis one feels whether or not the \u201cbackground thoughts\u201d\nwhich are to be expected have been exhausted. The way in which Irma\nstands at the window suddenly reminds me of another experience. Irma\npossesses an intimate woman friend, of whom I think very highly. One\nevening on paying her a visit I found her in the position at the window\nreproduced in the dream, and her physician, the same Dr. M., declared\nthat she had a diphtheritic membrane. The person of Dr. M. and the\nmembrane return in the course of the dream. Now it occurs to me that\nduring the last few months, I have been given every reason to suppose\nthat this lady is also hysterical. Yes, Irma herself has betrayed this\nto me. But what do I know about her condition? Only the one thing, that\nlike Irma she suffers from hysterical choking in dreams. Thus in the\ndream I have replaced my patient by her friend. Now I remember that I\nhave often trifled with the expectation that this lady might likewise\nengage me to relieve her of her symptoms. But even at the time I thought\nit improbable, for she is of a very shy nature. _She resists_, as the\ndream shows. Another explanation might be that _she does not need it_;\nin fact, until now she has shown herself strong enough to master her\ncondition without outside help. Now only a few features remain, which I\ncan assign neither to Irma nor to her friend: _Pale, bloated, false\nteeth_. The false teeth lead me to the governess; I now feel inclined to\nbe satisfied with bad teeth. Then another person, to whom these features\nmay allude, occurs to me. She is not my patient, and I do not wish her\nto be my patient, for I have noticed that she is not at her ease with\nme, and I do not consider her a docile patient. She is generally pale,\nand once, when she had a particularly good spell, she was bloated.[U] I\nhave thus compared my patient Irma with two others, who would likewise\nresist treatment. What can it mean that I have exchanged her for her\nfriend in the dream? Perhaps that I wish to exchange her; either the\nother one arouses in me stronger sympathies or I have a higher opinion\nof her intelligence. For I consider Irma foolish because she does not\naccept my solution. The other one would be more sensible, and would thus\nbe more likely to yield. _The mouth then really opens without\ndifficulty_; she would tell more than Irma.[V]\n_What I see in the throat; a white spot and scabby nostrils._\nThe white spot recalls diphtheria, and thus Irma\u2019s friend, but besides\nthis it recalls the grave illness of my eldest daughter two years before\nand all the anxiety of that unfortunate time. The scab on the nostrils\nreminds me of a concern about my own health. At that time I often used\ncocaine in order to suppress annoying swellings in the nose, and had\nheard a few days before that a lady patient who did likewise had\ncontracted an extensive necrosis of the nasal mucous membrane. The\nrecommendation of cocaine, which I had made in 1885, had also brought\ngrave reproaches upon me. A dear friend, already dead in 1895, had\nhastened his end through the misuse of this remedy.\n_I quickly call Dr. M., who repeats the examination._\nThis would simply correspond to the position which M. occupied among us.\nBut the word \u201cquickly\u201d is striking enough to demand a special\nexplanation. It reminds me of a sad medical experience. By the continued\nprescription of a remedy (sulfonal) which was still at that time\nconsidered harmless, I had once caused the severe intoxication of a\nwoman patient, and I had turned in great haste to an older, more\nexperienced colleague for assistance. The fact that I really had this\ncase in mind is confirmed by an accessory circumstance. The patient, who\nsuccumbed to the intoxication, bore the same name as my eldest daughter.\nI had never thought of this until now; now it seems to me almost like a\nretribution of fate\u2014as though I ought to continue the replacement of the\npersons here in another sense; this Matilda for that Matilda; an eye for\nan eye, a tooth for a tooth. It is as though I were seeking every\nopportunity to reproach myself with lack of medical conscientiousness.\n_Dr. M. is pale, without a beard on his chin, and he limps._\nOf this so much is correct, that his unhealthy appearance often awakens\nthe concern of his friends. The other two characteristics must belong to\nanother person. A brother living abroad occurs to me, who wears his chin\nclean-shaven, and to whom, if I remember aright, M. of the dream on the\nwhole bears some resemblance. About him the news arrived some days\nbefore that he was lame on account of an arthritic disease in the hip.\nThere must be a reason why I fuse the two persons into one in the dream.\nI remember that in fact I was on bad terms with both of them for similar\nreasons. Both of them had rejected a certain proposal which I had\nrecently made to them.\n_My friend Otto is now standing next to the sick woman, and my friend\nLeopold examines her and calls attention to a dulness on the left\nbelow._\nMy friend Leopold is also a physician, a relative of Otto. Since the two\npractise the same specialty, fate has made them competitors, who are\ncontinually being compared with each other. Both of them assisted me for\nyears, while I was still directing a public dispensary for nervous\nchildren. Scenes like the one reproduced in the dream have often taken\nplace there. While I was debating with Otto about the diagnosis of a\ncase, Leopold had examined the child anew and had made an unexpected\ncontribution towards the decision. For there was a difference of\ncharacter between the two similar to that between Inspector Brassig and\nhis friend Charles. The one was distinguished for his brightness, the\nother was slow, thoughtful, but thorough. If I contrast Otto and the\ncareful Leopold in the dream, I do it, apparently, in order to extol\nLeopold. It is a comparison similar to the one above between the\ndisobedient patient Irma and her friend who is thought to be more\nsensible. I now become aware of one of the tracks along which the\nthought association of the dream progresses; from the sick child to the\nchildren\u2019s asylum. The dulness to the left, below, recalls a certain\ncase corresponding to it, in every detail in which Leopold astonished me\nby his thoroughness. Besides this, I have a notion of something like a\nmetastatic affection, but it might rather be a reference to the lady\npatient whom I should like to have instead of Irma. For this lady, as\nfar as I can gather, resembles a woman suffering from tuberculosis.\n_An infiltrated portion of skin on the left shoulder._\nI see at once that this is my own rheumatism of the shoulder, which I\nalways feel when I have remained awake until late at night. The turn of\nphrase in the dream also sounds ambiguous; something which I feel ... in\nspite of the dress. \u201cFeel on my own body\u201d is intended. Moreover, I am\nstruck with the unusual sound of the term \u201cinfiltrated portion of skin.\u201d\n\u201cAn infiltration behind on the upper left\u201d is what we are accustomed to;\nthis would refer to the lung, and thus again to tuberculosis patients.\n_In spite of the dress._\nThis, to be sure, is only an interpolation. We, of course, examine the\nchildren in the clinic undressed; it is some sort of contradiction to\nthe manner in which grown-up female patients must be examined. The story\nused to be told of a prominent clinician that he always examined his\npatients physically only through the clothes. The rest is obscure to me;\nI have, frankly, no inclination to follow the matter further.\n_Dr. M. says: \u201cIt is an infection, but it does not matter. Dysentery\nwill develop, and the poison will he excreted._\u201d\nThis at first seems ridiculous to me; still it must be carefully\nanalysed like everything else. Observed more closely, it seems, however,\nto have a kind of meaning. What I had found in the patient was local\ndiphtheritis. I remember the discussion about diphtheritis and\ndiphtheria at the time of my daughter\u2019s illness. The latter is the\ngeneral infection which proceeds from local diphtheritis. Leopold proves\nthe existence of such general infection by means of the dulness, which\nthus suggests a metastatic lesion. I believe, however, that just this\nkind of metastasis does not occur in the case of diphtheria. It rather\nrecalls py\u00e6mia.\n_It does not matter_, is a consolation. I believe it fits in as follows:\nThe last part of the dream has yielded a content to the effect that the\npains of the patient are the result of a serious organic affection. I\nbegin to suspect that with this I am only trying to shift the blame from\nmyself. Psychic treatment cannot be held responsible for the continued\npresence of diphtheritic affection. But now, in turn, I am disturbed at\ninventing such serious suffering for Irma for the sole purpose of\nexculpating myself. It seems cruel. I need (accordingly) the assurance\nthat the result will be happy, and it does not seem ill-advised that I\nshould put the words of consolation into the mouth of Dr. M. But here I\nconsider myself superior to the dream, a fact which needs explanation.\nBut why is this consolation so nonsensical?\n_Dysentery_:\nSome sort of far-fetched theoretical notion that pathological material\nmay be removed through the intestines. Am I in this way trying to make\nfun of Dr. M.\u2019s great store of far-fetched explanations, his habit of\nfinding curious pathological relationships? Dysentery suggests something\nelse. A few months ago I had in charge a young man suffering from\nremarkable pains during evacuation of the bowels, a case which\ncolleagues had treated as \u201can\u00e6mia with malnutrition.\u201d I realised that it\nwas a question of hysteria; I was unwilling to use my psychotherapy on\nhim, and sent him off on a sea voyage. Now a few days before I had\nreceived a despairing letter from him from Egypt, saying that while\nthere he had suffered a new attack, which the physician had declared to\nbe dysentery. I suspect, indeed, that the diagnosis was only an error of\nmy ignorant colleague, who allows hysteria to make a fool of him; but\nstill I cannot avoid reproaching myself for putting the invalid in a\nposition where he might contract an organic affection of the bowels in\naddition to his hysteria. Furthermore, dysentery sounds like diphtheria,\na word which does not occur in the dream.\nIndeed it must be that, with the consoling prognosis: \u201cDysentery will\ndevelop, &c.,\u201d I am making fun of Dr. M., for I recollect that years ago\nhe once jokingly told a very similar story of another colleague. He had\nbeen called to consult with this colleague in the case of a woman who\nwas very seriously ill and had felt obliged to confront the other\nphysician, who seemed very hopeful, with the fact that he found albumen\nin the patient\u2019s urine. The colleague, however, did not let this worry\nhim, but answered calmly: \u201cThat does not matter, doctor; the albumen\nwill without doubt be excreted.\u201d Thus I can no longer doubt that\nderision for those colleagues who are ignorant of hysteria is contained\nin this part of the dream. As though in confirmation, this question now\narises in my mind: \u201cDoes Dr. M. know that the symptoms of his patient,\nof our friend Irma, which give cause for fearing tuberculosis, are also\nbased on hysteria? Has he recognised this hysteria, or has he stupidly\nignored it?\u201d\nBut what can be my motive in treating this friend so badly? This is very\nsimple: Dr. M. agrees with my solution as little as Irma herself. I have\nthus already in this dream taken revenge on two persons, on Irma in the\nwords, \u201cIf you still have pains, it is your own fault,\u201d and on Dr. M. in\nthe wording of the nonsensical consolation which has been put into his\nmouth.\n_We have immediate knowledge of the origin of the infection._\nThis immediate knowledge in the dream is very remarkable. Just before we\ndid not know it, since the infection was first demonstrated by Leopold.\n_My friend Otto has recently given her an injection when she felt ill._\nOtto had actually related that in the short time of his visit to Irma\u2019s\nfamily, he had been called to a neighbouring hotel in order to give an\ninjection to some one who fell suddenly ill. Injections again recall the\nunfortunate friend who has poisoned himself with cocaine. I had\nrecommended the remedy to him merely for internal use during the\nwithdrawal of morphine, but he once gave himself injections of cocaine.\n_With a propyl preparation ... propyls ... propionic acid._ How did this\never occur to me? On the same evening on which I had written part of the\nhistory of the disease before having the dream, my wife opened a bottle\nof cordial labelled \u201cAnanas,\u201d[W] (which was a present from our friend\nOtto. For he had a habit of making presents on every possible occasion;\nI hope he will some day be cured of this by a wife).[X] Such a smell of\nfusel oil arose from this cordial that I refused to taste it. My wife\nobserved: \u201cWe will give this bottle to the servants,\u201d and I, still more\nprudent, forbade it, with the philanthropic remark: \u201cThey mustn\u2019t be\npoisoned either.\u201d The smell of fusel oil (amyl ...) has now apparently\nawakened in my memory the whole series, propyl, methyl, &c., which has\nfurnished the propyl preparation of the dream. In this, it is true, I\nhave employed a substitution; I have dreamt of propyl, after smelling\namyl, but substitutions of this kind are perhaps permissible, especially\nin organic chemistry.\n_Trimethylamin._ I see the chemical formula of this substance in the\ndream, a fact which probably gives evidence of a great effort on the\npart of my memory, and, moreover, the formula is printed in heavy type,\nas if to lay special stress upon something of particular importance, as\ndistinguished from the context. To what does this trimethylamin lead,\nwhich has been so forcibly called to my attention? It leads to a\nconversation with another friend who for years has known all my\ngerminating activities, as I have his. At that time he had just informed\nme of some of his ideas about sexual chemistry, and had mentioned, among\nothers, that he thought he recognised in trimethylamin one of the\nproducts of sexual metabolism. This substance thus leads me to\nsexuality, to that factor which I credit with the greatest significance\nfor the origin of the nervous affections which I attempt to cure. My\npatient Irma is a young widow; if I am anxious to excuse the failure of\nher cure, I suppose I shall best do so by referring to this condition,\nwhich her admirers would be glad to change. How remarkably, too, such a\ndream is fashioned! The other woman, whom I take as my patient in the\ndream instead of Irma, is also a young widow.\nI suspect why the formula of trimethylamin has made itself so prominent\nin the dream. So many important things are gathered up in this one word:\nTrimethylamin is not only an allusion to the overpowering factor of\nsexuality, but also to a person whose sympathy I remember with\nsatisfaction when I feel myself forsaken in my opinions. Should not this\nfriend, who plays such a large part in my life, occur again in the chain\nof thoughts of the dream? Of course, he must; he is particularly\nacquainted with the results which proceed from affections of the nose\nand its adjacent cavities, and has revealed to science several highly\nremarkable relations of the turbinated bones to the female sexual organs\n(the three curly formations in Irma\u2019s throat). I have had Irma examined\nby him to see whether the pains in her stomach might be of nasal origin.\nBut he himself suffers from suppurative rhinitis, which worries him, and\nto this perhaps there is an allusion in py\u00e6mia, which hovers before me\nin the metastases of the dream.\n_Such injections are not made so rashly._ Here the reproach of\ncarelessness is hurled directly at my friend Otto. I am under the\nimpression that I had some thought of this sort in the afternoon, when\nhe seemed to indicate his siding against me by word and look. It was\nperhaps: \u201cHow easily he can be influenced; how carelessly he pronounces\njudgment.\u201d Furthermore, the above sentence again points to my deceased\nfriend, who so lightly took refuge in cocaine injections. As I have\nsaid, I had not intended injections of the remedy at all. I see that in\nreproaching Otto I again touch upon the story of the unfortunate\nMatilda, from which arises the same reproach against me. Obviously I am\nhere collecting examples of my own conscientiousness, but also of the\nopposite.\n_Probably also the syringe was not clean._ Another reproach directed at\nOtto, but originating elsewhere. The day before I happened to meet the\nson of a lady eighty-two years of age whom I am obliged to give daily\ntwo injections of morphine. At present she is in the country, and I have\nheard that she is suffering from an inflammation of the veins. I\nimmediately thought that it was a case of infection due to contamination\nfrom the syringe. It is my pride that in two years I have not given her\na single infection; I am constantly concerned, of course, to see that\nthe syringe is perfectly clean. For I am conscientious. From the\ninflammation of the veins, I return to my wife, who had suffered from\nemboli during a period of pregnancy, and now three related situations\ncome to the surface in my memory, involving my wife, Irma, and the\ndeceased Matilda, the identity of which three persons plainly justifies\nmy putting them in one another\u2019s place.\nI have now completed the interpretation of the dream.[Y] In the course\nof this interpretation I have taken great pains to get possession of all\nthe notions to which a comparison between the dream content and the\ndream thoughts hidden behind it must have given rise. Meanwhile, the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of the dream has dawned upon me. I have become conscious of a\npurpose which is realised by means of the dream, and which must have\nbeen the motive for dreaming. The dream fulfils several wishes, which\nhave been actuated in me by the events of the preceding evening (Otto\u2019s\nnews, and the writing down of the history of the disease). For the\nresult of the dream is that I am not to blame for the suffering which\nIrma still has, and that Otto is to blame for it. Now Otto has made me\nangry by his remark about Irma\u2019s imperfect cure; the dream avenges me\nupon him by turning the reproach back upon himself. The dream acquits me\nof responsibility for Irma\u2019s condition by referring it to other causes,\nwhich indeed furnish a great number of explanations. The dream\nrepresents a certain condition of affairs as I should wish it to be;\n_the content of the dream is thus the fulfilment of a wish; its motive\nis a wish_.\nThis much is apparent at first sight. But many things in the details of\nthe dream become intelligible when regarded from the point of view of\nwish-fulfilment. I take revenge on Otto, not only for hastily taking\npart against me, in that I accuse him of a careless medical operation\n(the injection), but I am also avenged on him for the bad cordial which\nsmells like fusel oil, and I find an expression in the dream which\nunites both reproaches; the injection with a preparation of propyl.\nStill I am not satisfied, but continue my revenge by comparing him to\nhis more reliable competitor. I seem to say by this: \u201cI like him better\nthan you.\u201d But Otto is not the only one who must feel the force of my\nanger. I take revenge on the disobedient patient by exchanging her for a\nmore sensible, more docile one. Nor do I leave the contradiction of Dr.\nM. unnoticed, but express my opinion of him in an obvious allusion, to\nthe effect that his relation to the question is that of _an ignoramus_\n(\u201c_dysentery will develop_,\u201d _&c._).\nIt seems to me, indeed, as though I were appealing from him to some one\nbetter informed (my friend, who has told me about trimethylamin); just\nas I have turned from Irma to her friend, I turn from Otto to Leopold.\nRid me of these three persons, replace them by three others of my own\nchoice, and I shall be released from the reproaches which I do not wish\nto have deserved! The unreasonableness itself of these reproaches is\nproved to me in the dream in the most elaborate way. Irma\u2019s pains are\nnot charged to me, because she herself is to blame for them, in that she\nrefuses to accept my solution. Irma\u2019s pains are none of my business, for\nthey are of an organic nature, quite impossible to be healed by a\npsychic cure. Irma\u2019s sufferings are satisfactorily explained by her\nwidowhood (trimethylamin!); a fact which, of course, I cannot alter.\nIrma\u2019s illness has been caused by an incautious injection on the part of\nOtto, with an ill-suited substance\u2014in a way I should never have made an\ninjection. Irma\u2019s suffering is the result of an injection made with an\nunclean syringe, just like the inflammation of the veins in my old lady,\nwhile I never do any such mischief with my injections. I am aware,\nindeed, that these explanations of Irma\u2019s illness, which unite in\nacquitting me, do not agree with one another; they even exclude one\nanother. The whole pleading\u2014this dream is nothing else\u2014recalls vividly\nthe defensive argument of a man who was accused by his neighbour of\nhaving returned a kettle to him in a damaged condition. In the first\nplace, he said, he had returned the kettle undamaged; in the second, it\nalready had holes in it when he borrowed it; and thirdly, he had never\nborrowed the kettle from his neighbour at all. But so much the better;\nif even one of these three methods of defence is recognised as valid,\nthe man must be acquitted.\nStill other subjects mingle in the dream, whose relation to my release\nfrom responsibility for Irma\u2019s illness is not so transparent: the\nillness of my daughter and that of a patient of the same name, the\nharmfulness of cocaine, the illness of my patient travelling in Egypt,\nconcern about the health of my wife, my brother, of Dr. M., my own\nbodily troubles, and concern about the absent friend who is suffering\nfrom suppurative rhinitis. But if I keep all these things in view, they\ncombine into a single train of thought, labelled perhaps: Concern for\nthe health of myself and others\u2014professional conscientiousness. I recall\nan undefined disagreeable sensation as Otto brought me the news of\nIrma\u2019s condition. I should like to note finally the expression of this\nfleeting sensation, which is part of the train of thought that is\nmingled into the dream. It is as though Otto had said to me: \u201cYou do not\ntake your physician\u2019s duties seriously enough, you are not\nconscientious, do not keep your promises.\u201d Thereupon this train of\nthought placed itself at my service in order that I might exhibit proof\nof the high degree in which I am conscientious, how intimately I am\nconcerned with the health of my relatives, friends, and patients.\nCuriously enough, there are also in this thought material some painful\nmemories, which correspond rather to the blame attributed to Otto than\nto the accusation against me. The material has the appearance of being\nimpartial, but the connection between this broader material, upon which\nthe dream depends, and the more limited theme of the dream which gives\nrise to the wish to be innocent of Irma\u2019s illness, is nevertheless\nunmistakable.\nI do not wish to claim that I have revealed the meaning of the dream\nentirely, or that the interpretation is flawless.\nI could still spend much time upon it; I could draw further explanations\nfrom it, and bring up new problems which it bids us consider. I even\nknow the points from which further thought associations might be traced;\nbut such considerations as are connected with every dream of one\u2019s own\nrestrain me from the work of interpretation. Whoever is ready to condemn\nsuch reserve, may himself try to be more straightforward than I. I am\ncontent with the discovery which has been just made. If the method of\ndream interpretation here indicated is followed, it will be found that\nthe dream really has meaning, and is by no means the expression of\nfragmentary brain activity, which the authors would have us believe.\n_When the work of interpretation has been completed the dream may be\nrecognised as the fulfilment of a wish._\nIII\nTHE DREAM IS THE FULFILMENT OF A WISH\nWhen after passing a defile one has reached an eminence where the ways\npart and where the view opens out broadly in different directions, it is\npermissible to stop for a moment and to consider where one is to turn\nnext. Something like this happens to us after we have mastered this\nfirst dream interpretation. We find ourselves in the open light of a\nsudden cognition. The dream is not comparable to the irregular sounds of\na musical instrument, which, instead of being touched by the hand of the\nmusician, is struck by some outside force; the dream is not senseless,\nnot absurd, does not presuppose that a part of our store of ideas is\ndormant while another part begins to awaken. It is a psychic phenomenon\nof full value, and indeed the fulfilment of a wish; it takes its place\nin the concatenation of the waking psychic actions which are\nintelligible to us, and it has been built up by a highly complicated\nintellectual activity. But at the very moment when we are inclined to\nrejoice in this discovery, a crowd of questions overwhelms us. If the\ndream, according to the interpretation, represents a wish fulfilled,\nwhat is the cause of the peculiar and unfamiliar manner in which this\nfulfilment is expressed? What changes have occurred in the dream\nthoughts before they are transformed into the manifest dream which we\nremember upon awaking? In what manner has this transformation taken\nplace? Whence comes the material which has been worked over into the\ndream? What causes the peculiarities which we observe in the dream\nthoughts, for example, that they may contradict one another? (The\nanalogy of the kettle, p. 87). Is the dream capable of teaching us\nsomething new about our inner psychic processes, and can its content\ncorrect opinions which we have held during the day? I suggest that for\nthe present all these questions be laid aside, and that a single path be\npursued. We have found that the dream represents a wish as fulfilled. It\nwill be our next interest to ascertain whether this is a universal\ncharacteristic of the dream, or only the accidental content of the dream\n(\u201cof Irma\u2019s injection\u201d) with which we have begun our analysis, for even\nif we make up our minds that every dream has a meaning and psychic\nvalue, we must nevertheless allow for the possibility that this meaning\nis not the same in every dream. The first dream we have considered was\nthe fulfilment of a wish; another may turn out to be a realised\napprehension; a third may have a reflection as to its content; a fourth\nmay simply reproduce a reminiscence. Are there then other wish dreams;\nor are there possibly nothing but wish dreams?\nIt is easy to show that the character of wish-fulfilment in dreams is\noften undisguised and recognisable, so that one may wonder why the\nlanguage of dreams has not long since been understood. There is, for\nexample, a dream which I can cause as often as I like, as it were\nexperimentally. If in the evening I eat anchovies, olives, or other\nstrongly salted foods, I become thirsty at night, whereupon I waken. The\nawakening, however, is preceded by a dream, which each time has the same\ncontent, namely, that I am drinking. I quaff water in long draughts, it\ntastes as sweet as only a cool drink can taste when one\u2019s throat is\nparched, and then I awake and have an actual desire to drink. The\noccasion for this dream is thirst, which I perceive when I awake. The\nwish to drink originates from this sensation, and the dream shows me\nthis wish as fulfilled. It thereby serves a function the nature of which\nI soon guess. I sleep well, and am not accustomed to be awakened by a\nbodily need. If I succeed in assuaging my thirst by means of the dream\nthat I am drinking, I need not wake up in order to satisfy it. It is\nthus a dream of convenience. The dream substitutes itself for action, as\nelsewhere in life. Unfortunately the need of water for quenching thirst\ncannot be satisfied with a dream, like my thirst for revenge upon Otto\nand Dr. M., but the intention is the same. This same dream recently\nappeared in modified form. On this occasion I became thirsty before\ngoing to bed, and emptied the glass of water which stood on the little\nchest next to my bed. Several hours later in the night came a new attack\nof thirst, accompanied by discomfort. In order to obtain water, I should\nhave had to get up and fetch the glass which stood on the night-chest of\nmy wife. I thus quite appropriately dreamt that my wife was giving me a\ndrink from a vase; this vase was an Etruscan cinerary urn which I had\nbrought home from an Italian journey and had since given away. But the\nwater in it tasted so salty (apparently from the ashes) that I had to\nwake. It may be seen how conveniently the dream is capable of arranging\nmatters; since the fulfilment of a wish is its only purpose, it may be\nperfectly egotistic. Love of comfort is really not compatible with\nconsideration for others. The introduction of the cinerary urn is\nprobably again the fulfilment of a wish; I am sorry that I no longer\npossess this vase; it, like the glass of water at my wife\u2019s side, is\ninaccessible to me. The cinerary urn is also appropriate to the\nsensation of a salty taste which has now grown stronger, and which I\nknow will force me to wake up.[Z]\nSuch convenience dreams were very frequent with me in the years of my\nyouth. Accustomed as I had always been to work until late at night,\nearly awakening was always a matter of difficulty for me. I used then to\ndream that I was out of bed and was standing at the wash-stand. After a\nwhile I could not make myself admit that I have not yet got up, but\nmeanwhile I had slept for a time. I am acquainted with the same dream of\nlaziness as dreamt by a young colleague of mine, who seems to share my\npropensity for sleep. The lodging-house keeper with whom he was living\nin the neighbourhood of the hospital had strict orders to wake him on\ntime every morning, but she certainly had a lot of trouble when she\ntried to carry out his orders. One morning sleep was particularly sweet.\nThe woman called into the room: \u201cMr. Joe, get up; you must go to the\nhospital.\u201d Whereupon the sleeper dreamt of a room in the hospital, a bed\nin which he was lying, and a chart pinned over his head reading: \u201cJoe\nH.... cand. med. 22 years old.\u201d He said to himself in the dream: \u201cIf I\nam already at the hospital, I don\u2019t have to go there,\u201d turned over and\nslept on. He had thus frankly admitted to himself his motive for\ndreaming.\nHere is another dream, the stimulus for which acts during sleep itself:\nOne of my women patients, who had had to undergo an unsuccessful\noperation on the jaw, was to wear a cooling apparatus on the affected\ncheek, according to the orders of the physicians. But she was in the\nhabit of throwing it off as soon as she had got to sleep. One day I was\nasked to reprove her for doing so; for she had again thrown the\napparatus on the floor. The patient defended herself as follows: \u201cThis\ntime I really couldn\u2019t help it; it was the result of a dream which I had\nin the night. In the dream, I was in a box at the opera and was taking a\nlively interest in the performance. But Mr. Karl Meyer was lying in the\nsanatorium and complaining pitifully on account of pains in his jaw. I\nsaid to myself, \u2018Since I haven\u2019t the pains, I don\u2019t need the apparatus\neither,\u2019 that\u2019s why I threw it away.\u201d This dream of the poor sufferer is\nsimilar to the idea in the expression which comes to our lips when we\nare in a disagreeable situation: \u201cI know something that\u2019s a great deal\nmore fun.\u201d The dream presents this great deal more fun. Mr. Karl Meyer,\nto whom the dreamer attributed her pains, was the most indifferent young\nman of her acquaintance whom she could recall.\nIt is no more difficult to discover the fulfilment of wishes in several\ndreams which I have collected from healthy persons. A friend who knew my\ntheory of dreams and had imparted it to his wife, said to me one day:\n\u201cMy wife asked me to tell you that she dreamt yesterday that she was\nhaving her menses. You will know what that means.\u201d Of course I know: if\nthe young wife dreams that she is having her menses, the menses have\nstopped. I can understand that she would have liked to enjoy her freedom\nfor a time longer before the discomforts of motherhood began. It was a\nclever way of giving notice of her first pregnancy. Another friend\nwrites that his wife had recently dreamt that she noticed milk stains on\nthe bosom of her waist. This is also an indication of pregnancy, but\nthis time not of the first one; the young mother wishes to have more\nnourishment for the second child than she had for the first.\nA young woman, who for weeks had been cut off from company because she\nwas nursing a child that was suffering from an infectious disease,\ndreams, after its safe termination, of a company of people in which A.\nDaudet, Bourget, M. Prevost, and others are present, all of whom are\nvery pleasant to her and entertain her admirably. The different authors\nin the dream also have the features which their pictures give them. M.\nPrevost, with whose picture she is not familiar, looks like\u2014the\ndisinfecting man who on the previous day had cleaned the sick rooms and\nhad entered them as the first visitor after a long period. Apparently\nthe dream might be perfectly translated thus: \u201cIt is about time now for\nsomething more entertaining than this eternal nursing.\u201d\nPerhaps this selection will suffice to prove that often and under the\nmost complex conditions dreams are found which can be understood only as\nfulfilments of wishes, and which present their contents without\nconcealment. In most cases these are short and simple dreams, which\nstand in pleasant contrast to the confused and teeming dream\ncompositions which have mainly attracted the attention of the authors.\nBut it will pay to spend some time upon these simple dreams. The most\nsimple dreams of all, I suppose, are to be expected in the case of\nchildren, whose psychic activities are certainly less complicated than\nthose of adults. The psychology of children, in my opinion, is to be\ncalled upon for services similar to those which a study of the anatomy\nand development of the lower animals renders to the investigation of the\nstructure of the highest classes of animals. Until now only a few\nconscious efforts have been made to take advantage of the psychology of\nchildren for such a purpose.\nThe dreams of little children are simple fulfilments of wishes, and as\ncompared, therefore, with the dreams of adults, are not at all\ninteresting. They present no problem to be solved, but are naturally\ninvaluable as affording proof that the dream in its essence signifies\nthe fulfilment of a wish. I have been able to collect several examples\nof such dreams from the material furnished by my own children.\nFor two dreams, one of my daughters, at that time eight and a half years\nold, the other of a boy five and a quarter years of age, I am indebted\nto an excursion to the beautiful Hallstatt in the summer of 1896. I must\nmake the preliminary statement that during this summer we were living on\na hill near Aussee, from which, when the weather was good, we enjoyed a\nsplendid view of the Dachstein from the roof of our house. The Simony\nHut could easily be recognised with a telescope. The little ones often\ntried to see it through the telescope\u2014I do not know with what success.\nBefore the excursion I had told the children that Hallstatt lay at the\nfoot of the Dachstein. They looked forward to the day with great joy.\nFrom Hallstatt we entered the valley of Eschern, which highly pleased\nthe children with its varying aspects. One of them, however, the boy of\nfive, gradually became discontented. As often as a mountain came in\nview, he would ask: \u201cIs that the Dachstein?\u201d whereupon I would have to\nanswer: \u201cNo, only a foot-hill.\u201d After this question had been repeated\nseveral times, he became altogether silent; and he was quite unwilling\nto come along on the flight of steps to the waterfall. I thought he was\ntired out. But the next morning, he approached me radiant with joy, and\nsaid: \u201cLast night I dreamt that we were at Simony Hut.\u201d I understood him\nnow; he had expected, as I was speaking of the Dachstein, that on the\nexcursion to Hallstatt, he would ascend the mountain and would come face\nto face with the hut, about which there had been so much discussion at\nthe telescope. When he learned that he was expected to be regaled with\nfoot-hills and a waterfall, he was disappointed and became discontented.\nThe dream compensated him for this. I tried to learn some details of the\ndream; they were scanty. \u201cSteps must be climbed for six hours,\u201d as he\nhad heard.\nOn this excursion wishes, destined to be satisfied only in dreams, had\narisen also in the mind of the girl of eight and a half years. We had\ntaken with us to Hallstatt the twelve-year-old boy of our neighbour\u2014an\naccomplished cavalier, who, it seems to me, already enjoyed the full\nsympathy of the little woman. The next morning, then, she related the\nfollowing dream: \u201cJust think, I dreamt that Emil was one of us, that he\nsaid papa and mamma to you, and slept at our house in the big room like\nour boys. Then mamma came into the room and threw a large handful of\nchocolate bars under our beds.\u201d The brothers of the girl, who evidently\nhad not inherited a familiarity with dream interpretation, declared just\nlike the authors: \u201cThat dream is nonsense.\u201d The girl defended at least a\npart of the dream, and it is worth while, from the point of view of the\ntheory of neuroses, to know which part: \u201cThat about Emil belonging to us\nis nonsense, but that about the bars of chocolate is not.\u201d It was just\nthis latter part that was obscure to me. For this mamma furnished me the\nexplanation. On the way home from the railway station the children had\nstopped in front of a slot machine, and had desired exactly such\nchocolate bars wrapped in paper with a metallic lustre, as the machine,\naccording to their experience, had for sale. But the mother had rightly\nthought that the day had brought enough wish-fulfilment, and had left\nthis wish to be satisfied in dreams. This little scene had escaped me. I\nat once understood that portion of the dream which had been condemned by\nmy daughter. I had myself heard the well-behaved guest enjoining the\nchildren to wait until papa or mamma had come up. For the little one the\ndream made a lasting adoption based on this temporary relation of the\nboy to us. Her tender nature was as yet unacquainted with any form of\nbeing together except those mentioned in the dream, which are taken from\nher brothers. Why the chocolate bars were thrown under the bed could\nnot, of course, be explained without questioning the child.\nFrom a friend I have learnt of a dream very similar to that of my boy.\nIt concerned an eight-year-old girl. The father had undertaken a walk to\nDornbach with the children, intending to visit the Rohrerh\u00fctte, but\nturned back because it had grown too late, and promised the children to\nmake up for their disappointment some other time. On the way back, they\npassed a sign which showed the way to the Hameau. The children now asked\nto be taken to that place also, but had to be content, for the same\nreason, with a postponement to another day. The next morning, the\neight-year-old girl came to the father, satisfied, saying: \u201cPapa, I\ndreamt last night that you were with us at the Rohrerh\u00fctte and on the\nHameau.\u201d Her impatience had thus in the dream anticipated the fulfilment\nof the promise made by her father.\nAnother dream, which the picturesque beauty of the Aussee inspired in my\ndaughter, at that time three and a quarter years old, is equally\nstraightforward. The little one had crossed the lake for the first time,\nand the trip had passed too quickly for her. She did not want to leave\nthe boat at the landing, and cried bitterly. The next morning she told\nus: \u201cLast night I was sailing on the lake.\u201d Let us hope that the\nduration of this dream ride was more satisfactory to her.\nMy eldest boy, at that time eight years of age, was already dreaming of\nthe realisation of his fancies. He had been riding in a chariot with\nAchilles, with Diomed as charioteer. He had, of course, on the previous\nday shown a lively interest in the _Myths of Greece_, which had been\ngiven to his elder sister.\nIf it be granted that the talking of children in sleep likewise belongs\nto the category of dreaming, I may report the following as one of the\nmost recent dreams in my collection. My youngest girl, at that time\nnineteen months old, had vomited one morning, and had therefore been\nkept without food throughout the day. During the night which followed\nupon this day of hunger, she was heard to call excitedly in her sleep:\n\u201cAnna Feud, strawberry, huckleberry, omelette, pap!\u201d She used her name\nin this way in order to express her idea of property; the menu must have\nincluded about everything which would seem to her a desirable meal; the\nfact that berries appeared in it twice was a demonstration against the\ndomestic sanitary regulations, and was based on the circumstance, by no\nmeans overlooked by her, that the nurse ascribed her indisposition to an\nover-plentiful consumption of strawberries; she thus in the dream took\nrevenge for this opinion which was distasteful to her.[AA]\nIf we call childhood happy because it does not yet know sexual desire,\nwe must not forget how abundant a source of disappointment and\nself-denial, and thus of dream stimulation, the other of the great\nlife-impulses may become for it.[AB] Here is a second example showing\nthis. My nephew of twenty-two months had been given the task of\ncongratulating me upon my birthday, and of handing me, as a present, a\nlittle basket of cherries, which at that time of the year were not yet\nin season. It seemed difficult for him, for he repeated again and again:\n\u201cCherries in it,\u201d and could not be induced to let the little basket go\nout of his hands. But he knew how to secure his compensation. He had,\nuntil now, been in the habit of telling his mother every morning that he\nhad dreamt of the \u201cwhite soldier,\u201d an officer of the guard in a white\ncloak, whom he had once admired on the street. On the day after the\nbirthday, he awakened joyfully with the information which could have had\nits origin only in a dream: \u201cHe(r)man eat up all the cherries!\u201d[AC]\nWhat animals dream of I do not know. A proverb for which I am indebted\nto one of my readers claims to know, for it raises the question: \u201cWhat\ndoes the goose dream of?\u201d the answer being: \u201cOf maize!\u201d The whole theory\nthat the dream is the fulfilment of a wish is contained in these\nsentences.[AD]\nWe now perceive that we should have reached our theory of the hidden\nmeaning of the dream by the shortest road if we had merely consulted\ncolloquial usage. The wisdom of proverbs, it is true, sometimes speaks\ncontemptuously enough of the dream\u2014it apparently tries to justify\nscience in expressing the opinion that \u201cDreams are mere bubbles;\u201d but\nstill for colloquial usage the dream is the gracious fulfiller of\nwishes. \u201cI should never have fancied that in the wildest dream,\u201d\nexclaims one who finds his expectations surpassed in reality.\nIV\nDISTORTION IN DREAMS\nIf I make the assertion that wish fulfilment is the meaning of every\ndream, that, accordingly, there can be no dreams except wish dreams, I\nam sure at the outset to meet with the most emphatic contradiction.\nObjections will be made to this effect: \u201cThe fact that there are dreams\nwhich must be understood as fulfilments of wishes is not new, but, on\nthe contrary, has long since been recognised by the authors. _Cf._\nRadestock[54] (pp. 137\u2013138), Volkelt[72] (pp. 110\u2013111), Tissi\u00e9[68] (p.\n70), M. Simon[63] (p. 42) on the hunger dreams of the imprisoned Baron\nTrenck, and the passage in Griesinger[31] (p. 11). The assumption that\nthere can be nothing but dreams of wish fulfilment, however, is another\nof those unjustified generalisations by which you have been pleased to\ndistinguish yourself of late. Indeed dreams which exhibit the most\npainful content, but not a trace of wish fulfilment, occur plentifully\nenough. The pessimistic philosopher, Edward von Hartman, perhaps stands\nfurthest from the theory of wish fulfilment. He expresses himself in his\n_Philosophy of the Unconscious_, Part II. (stereotyped edition, p. 34),\nto the following effect:\u2014\n\u201c\u2018As regards the dream, all the troubles of waking life are transferred\nby it to the sleeping state; only the one thing, which can in some\nmeasure reconcile a cultured person to life-scientific and artistic\nenjoyment is not transferred....\u2019 But even less discontented observers\nhave laid emphasis on the fact that in dreams pain and disgust are more\nfrequent than pleasure; so Scholz[59] (p. 39), Volkelt[72] (p. 80), and\nothers. Indeed two ladies, Sarah Weed and Florence Hallam,[33] have\nfound from the elaboration of their dreams a mathematical expression for\nthe preponderance of displeasure in dreams. They designate 58 per cent.\nof the dreams as disagreeable, and only 28\u00b76 per cent. as positively\npleasant. Besides those dreams which continue the painful sensations of\nlife during sleep, there are also dreams of fear, in which this most\nterrible of all disagreeable sensations tortures us until we awake, and\nit is with just these dreams of fear that children are so often\npersecuted (_Cf._ Debacker [17] concerning the Pavor Nocturnus), though\nit is in the case of children that you have found dreams of wishing\nundisguised.\u201d\nIndeed it is the anxiety dreams which seem to prevent a generalisation\nof the thesis that the dream is a wish-fulfilment, which we have\nestablished by means of the examples in the last section; they seem even\nto brand this thesis as an absurdity.\nIt is not difficult, however, to escape these apparently conclusive\nobjections. Please observe that our doctrine does not rest upon an\nacceptance of the manifest dream content, but has reference to the\nthought content which is found to lie behind the dream by the process of\ninterpretation. Let us contrast the _manifest_ and the _latent dream\ncontent_. It is true that there are dreams whose content is of the most\npainful nature. But has anyone ever tried to interpret these dreams, to\ndisclose their latent thought content? If not, the two objections are no\nlonger valid against us; there always remains the possibility that even\npainful and fearful dreams may be discovered to be wish fulfilments upon\ninterpretation.[AE]\nIn scientific work it is often advantageous, when the solution of one\nproblem presents difficulties, to take up a second problem, just as it\nis easier to crack two nuts together instead of separately. Accordingly\nwe are confronted not merely with the problem: How can painful and\nfearful dreams be the fulfilments of wishes? but we may also, from our\ndiscussion so far, raise the question: Why do not the dreams which show\nan indifferent content, but turn out to be wish-fulfilments, show this\nmeaning undisguised? Take the fully reported dream of Irma\u2019s injection;\nit is in no way painful in its nature, and can be recognised, upon\ninterpretation, as a striking wish-fulfilment. Why, in the first place,\nis an interpretation necessary? Why does not the dream say directly what\nit means? As a matter of fact, even the dream of Irma\u2019s injection does\nnot at first impress us as representing a wish of the dreamer as\nfulfilled. The reader will not have received this impression, and even I\nmyself did not know it until I had undertaken the analysis. If we call\nthis peculiarity of the dream of needing an explanation _the fact of the\ndistortion_ of dreams, then a second question arises: What is the origin\nof this disfigurement of dreams?\nIf one\u2019s first impressions on this subject were consulted, one might\nhappen upon several possible solutions; for example, that there is an\ninability during sleep to find an adequate expression for the dream\nthoughts. The analysis of certain dreams, however, compels us to give\nthe disfigurement of dreams another explanation. I shall show this by\nemploying a second dream of my own, which again involves numerous\nindiscretions, but which compensates for this personal sacrifice by\naffording a thorough elucidation of the problem.\n_Preliminary Statement._\u2014In the spring of 1897 I learnt that two\nprofessors of our university had proposed me for appointment as\nProfessor extraord. (assistant professor). This news reached me\nunexpectedly and pleased me considerably as an expression of\nappreciation on the part of two eminent men which could not be explained\nby personal interest. But, I immediately thought, I must not permit\nmyself to attach any expectation to this event. The university\ngovernment had during the last few years left proposals of this kind\nunconsidered, and several colleagues, who were ahead of me in years, and\nwho were at least my equals in merit, had been waiting in vain during\nthis time for their appointment. I had no reason to suppose I should\nfare better. I resolved then to comfort myself. I am not, so far as I\nknow, ambitious, and I engage in medical practice with satisfying\nresults even without the recommendation of a title. Moreover, it was not\na question whether I considered the grapes sweet or sour, for they\nundoubtedly hung much too high for me.\nOne evening I was visited by a friend of mine, one of those colleagues\nwhose fate I had taken as a warning for myself. As he had long been a\ncandidate for promotion to the position of professor, which in our\nsociety raises the physician to a demigod among his patients, and as he\nwas less resigned than I, he was in the habit of making representations\nfrom time to time, at the offices of the university government, for the\npurpose of advancing his interests. He came to me from a visit of that\nkind. He said that this time he had driven the exalted gentleman into a\ncorner, and had asked him directly whether considerations of creed were\nnot really responsible for the deferment of his appointment. The answer\nhad been that to be sure\u2014in the present state of public opinion\u2014His\nExcellency was not in a position, &c. \u201cNow I at least know what I am\nat,\u201d said my friend in closing his narrative, which told me nothing new,\nbut which was calculated to confirm me in my resignation. For the same\nconsiderations of creed applied to my own case.\nOn the morning after this visit, I had the following dream, which was\nnotable on account of its form. It consisted of two thoughts and two\nimages, so that a thought and an image alternated. But I here record\nonly the first half of the dream, because the other half has nothing to\ndo with the purpose which the citation of the dream should serve.\nI. _Friend R. is my uncle\u2014I feel great affection for him._\nII. _I see before me his face somewhat altered._\n_It seems to be elongated; a yellow beard, which surrounds it, is\nemphasised with peculiar distinctness._\nThen follow the other two portions, again a thought and an image, which\nI omit.\nThe interpretation of this dream was accomplished in the following\nmanner:\nAs the dream occurred to me in the course of the forenoon, I laughed\noutright and said: \u201cThe dream is nonsense.\u201d But I could not get it out\nof my mind, and the whole day it pursued me, until, at last, in the\nevening I reproached myself with the words: \u201cIf in the course of dream\ninterpretation one of your patients had nothing better to say than \u2018That\nis nonsense,\u2019 you would reprove him, and would suspect that behind the\ndream there was hidden some disagreeable affair, the exposure of which\nhe wanted to spare himself. Apply the same thing in your own case; your\nopinion that the dream is nonsense probably signifies merely an inner\nresistance to its interpretation. Do not let yourself be deterred.\u201d I\nthen proceeded to the interpretation.\n\u201cR. is my uncle.\u201d What does that mean. I have had only one uncle, my\nuncle Joseph.[AF] His story, to be sure, was a sad one. He had yielded\nto the temptation, more than thirty years before, of engaging in\ndealings which the law punishes severely, and which on that occasion\nalso it had visited with punishment. My father, who thereupon became\ngrey from grief in a few days, always used to say that Uncle Joseph was\nnever a wicked man, but that he was indeed a simpleton; so he expressed\nhimself. If, then, friend R. is my uncle Joseph, that is equivalent to\nsaying: \u201cR. is a simpleton.\u201d Hardly credible and very unpleasant! But\nthere is that face which I see in the dream, with its long features and\nits yellow beard. My uncle actually had such a face\u2014long and surrounded\nby a handsome blond beard. My friend R. was quite dark, but when\ndark-haired persons begin to grow grey, they pay for the glory of their\nyouthful years. Their black beard undergoes an unpleasant change of\ncolor, each hair separately; first it becomes reddish brown, then\nyellowish brown, and then at last definitely grey. The beard of my\nfriend R. is now in this stage, as is my own moreover, a fact which I\nnotice with regret. The face which I see in the dream is at once that of\nmy friend R. and that of my uncle. It is like a composite photograph of\nGalton, who, in order to emphasise family resemblances, had several\nfaces photographed on the same plate. No doubt is thus possible, I am\nreally of the opinion that my friend R. is a simpleton\u2014like my uncle\nJoseph.\nI have still no idea for what purpose I have constructed this\nrelationship, to which I must unconditionally object. But it is not a\nvery far-reaching one, for my uncle was a criminal, my friend R. is\ninnocent\u2014perhaps with the exception of having been punished for knocking\ndown an apprentice with his bicycle. Could I mean this offence? That\nwould be making ridiculous comparisons. Here I recollect another\nconversation which I had with another colleague, N., and indeed upon the\nsame subject. I met N. on the street. He likewise has been nominated for\na professorship, and having heard of my being honoured, congratulated me\nupon it. I declined emphatically, saying, \u201cYou are the last man to make\na joke like this, because you have experienced what the nomination is\nworth in your own case.\u201d Thereupon he said, though probably not in\nearnest, \u201cYou cannot be sure about that. Against me there is a very\nparticular objection. Don\u2019t you know that a woman once entered a legal\ncomplaint against me? I need not assure you that an inquiry was made; it\nwas a mean attempt at blackmail, and it was all I could do to save the\nplaintiff herself from punishment. But perhaps the affair will be\npressed against me at the office in order that I may not be appointed.\nYou, however, are above reproach.\u201d Here I have come upon a criminal, and\nat the same time upon the interpretation and trend of the dream. My\nuncle Joseph represents for me both colleagues who have not been\nappointed to the professorship, the one as a simpleton, the other as a\ncriminal. I also know now for what purpose I need this representation.\nIf considerations of creed are a determining factor in the postponement\nof the appointment of my friends, then my own appointment is also put in\nquestion: but if I can refer the rejection of the two friends to other\ncauses, which do not apply to my case, my hope remains undisturbed. This\nis the procedure of my dream; it makes the one, R., a simpleton, the\nother, N., a criminal; since, however, I am neither the one nor the\nother, our community of interest is destroyed, I have a right to enjoy\nthe expectation of being appointed a professor, and have escaped the\npainful application to my own case of the information which the high\nofficial has given to R.\nI must occupy myself still further with the interpretation of this\ndream. For my feelings it is not yet sufficiently cleared up. I am still\ndisquieted by the ease with which I degrade two respected colleagues for\nthe purpose of clearing the way to the professorship for myself. My\ndissatisfaction with my procedure has indeed diminished since I have\nlearnt to evaluate statements made in dreams. I would argue against\nanyone who urged that I really consider R. a simpleton, and that I do\nnot credit N.\u2019s account of the blackmail affair. I do not believe either\nthat Irma has been made seriously ill by an injection given her by Otto\nwith a preparation of propyl. Here, as before, it is only the _wish that\nthe case may be as the dream expresses it_. The statement in which my\nwish is realised sounds less absurd in the second dream than in the\nfirst; it is made here with a more skilful utilisation of facts as\npoints of attachment, something like a well-constructed slander, where\n\u201cthere is something in it.\u201d For my friend R. had at that time the vote\nof a professor from the department against him, and my friend N. had\nhimself unsuspectingly furnished me with the material for slander.\nNevertheless, I repeat, the dream seems to me to require further\nelucidation.\nI remember now that the dream contains still another portion which so\nfar our interpretation has not taken into account. After it occurs to me\nthat my friend R. is my uncle, I feel great affection for him. To whom\ndoes this feeling belong? For my uncle Joseph, of course, I have never\nhad any feelings of affection. For years my friend R. has been beloved\nand dear to me; but if I were to go to him and express my feelings for\nhim in terms which came anywhere near corresponding to the degree of\naffection in the dream, he would doubtless be surprised. My affection\nfor him seems untrue and exaggerated, something like my opinion of his\npsychic qualities, which I express by fusing his personality with that\nof my uncle; but it is exaggerated in an opposite sense. But now a new\nstate of affairs becomes evident to me. The affection in the dream does\nnot belong to the hidden content, to the thoughts behind the dream; it\nstands in opposition to this content; it is calculated to hide the\ninformation which interpretation may bring. Probably this is its very\npurpose. I recall with what resistance I applied myself to the work of\ninterpretation, how long I tried to postpone it, and how I declared the\ndream to be sheer nonsense. I know from my psychoanalytical treatments\nhow such condemnation is to be interpreted. It has no value as affording\ninformation, but only as the registration of an affect. If my little\ndaughter does not like an apple which is offered her, she asserts that\nthe apple has a bitter taste, without even having tasted it. If my\npatients act like the little girl, I know that it is a question of a\nnotion which they want to _suppress_. The same applies to my dream. I do\nnot want to interpret it because it contains something to which I\nobject. After the interpretation of the dream has been completed, I find\nout what it was I objected to; it was the assertion that R. is a\nsimpleton. I may refer the affection which I feel for R. not to the\nhidden dream thoughts, but rather to this unwillingness of mine. If my\ndream as compared with its hidden content is disfigured at this point,\nand is disfigured, moreover, into something opposite, then the apparent\naffection in the dream serves the purpose of disfigurement; or, in other\nwords, the disfigurement is here shown to be intended: it is a means of\ndissimulation. My dream thoughts contain an unfavourable reference to\nR.; in order that I may not become aware of it, its opposite, a feeling\nof affection for him, makes its way into the dream.\nThe fact here recognised might be of universal applicability. As the\nexamples in Section III. have shown, there are dreams which are\nundisguised wish-fulfilments. Wherever a wish-fulfilment is\nunrecognisable and concealed, there must be present a feeling of\nrepulsion towards this wish, and in consequence of this repulsion the\nwish is unable to gain expression except in a disfigured state. I shall\ntry to find a case in social life which is parallel to this occurrence\nin the inner psychic life. Where in social life can a similar\ndisfigurement of a psychic act be found? Only where two persons are in\nquestion, one of whom possesses a certain power, while the other must\nhave a certain consideration for this power. This second person will\nthen disfigure his psychic actions, or, as we may say, he will\ndissimulate. The politeness which I practise every day is largely\ndissimulation of this kind. If I interpret my dreams for the benefit of\nthe reader I am forced to make such distortions. The poet also complains\nabout such disfigurement:\n\u201cYou may not tell the best that you know to the youngsters.\u201d\nThe political writer who has unpleasant truths to tell to the government\nfinds himself in the same position. If he tells them without reserve,\nthe government will suppress them\u2014subsequently in case of a verbal\nexpression of opinion, preventatively, if they are to be published in\nprint. The writer must fear _censure_; he therefore modifies and\ndisfigures the expression of his opinion. He finds himself compelled,\naccording to the sensitiveness of this censure, either to restrain\nhimself from certain particular forms of attack or to speak in allusion\ninstead of direct designations. Or he must disguise his objectionable\nstatement in a garb that seems harmless. He may, for instance, tell of\nan occurrence between two mandarins in the Orient, while he has the\nofficials of his own country in view. The stricter the domination of the\ncensor, the more extensive becomes the disguise, and often the more\nhumorous the means employed to put the reader back on the track of the\nreal meaning.\nThe correspondence between the phenomena of the censor and those of\ndream distortion, which may be traced in detail, justifies us in\nassuming similar conditions for both. We should then assume in each\nhuman being, as the primary cause of dream formation, two psychic forces\n(streams, systems), of which one constitutes the wish expressed by the\ndream, while the other acts as a censor upon this dream wish, and by\nmeans of this censoring forces a distortion of its expression. The only\nquestion is as to the basis of the authority of this second instance[AG]\nby virtue of which it may exercise its censorship. If we remember that\nthe hidden dream thoughts are not conscious before analysis, but that\nthe apparent dream content is remembered as conscious, we easily reach\nthe assumption that admittance to consciousness is the privilege of the\nsecond instance. Nothing can reach consciousness from the first system\nwhich has not first passed the second instance, and the second instance\nlets nothing pass without exercising its rights and forcing such\nalterations upon the candidate for admission to consciousness as are\npleasant to itself. We are here forming a very definite conception of\nthe \u201cessence\u201d of consciousness; for us the state of becoming conscious\nis a particular psychic act, different from and independent of becoming\nfixed or of being conceived, and consciousness appears to us as an organ\nof sense, which perceives a content presented from another source. It\nmay be shown that psychopathology cannot possibly dispense with these\nfundamental assumptions. We may reserve a more thorough examination of\nthese for a later time.\nIf I keep in mind the idea of the two psychic instances and their\nrelations to consciousness, I find in the sphere of politics a very\nexact analogy for the extraordinary affection which I feel for my friend\nR., who suffers such degradation in the course of the dream\ninterpretation. I turn my attention to a political state in which a\nruler, jealous of his rights, and a live public opinion are in conflict\nwith each other. The people are indignant against an official whom they\nhate, and demand his dismissal; and in order not to show that he is\ncompelled to respect the public wish, the autocrat will expressly confer\nupon the official some great honour, for which there would otherwise\nhave been no occasion. Thus the second instance referred to, which\ncontrols access to consciousness, honours my friend R. with a profusion\nof extraordinary tenderness, because the wish activities of the first\nsystem, in accordance with a particular interest which they happen to be\npursuing, are inclined to put him down as a simpleton.[AH]\nPerhaps we shall now begin to suspect that dream interpretation is\ncapable of giving us hints about the structure of our psychic apparatus\nwhich we have thus far expected in vain from philosophy. We shall not,\nhowever, follow this track, but return to our original problem as soon\nas we have cleared up the subject of dream-disfigurement. The question\nhas arisen how dreams with disagreeable content can be analysed as the\nfulfilments of wishes. We see now that this is possible in case\ndream-disfigurement has taken place, in case the disagreeable content\nserves only as a disguise for what is wished. Keeping in mind our\nassumptions in regard to the two psychic instances, we may now proceed\nto say: disagreeable dreams, as a matter of fact, contain something\nwhich is disagreeable to the second instance, but which at the same time\nfulfils a wish of the first instance. They are wish dreams in the sense\nthat every dream originates in the first instance, while the second\ninstance acts towards the dream only in a repelling, not in a creative\nmanner. If we limit ourselves to a consideration of what the second\ninstance contributes to the dream, we can never understand the dream. If\nwe do so, all the riddles which the authors have found in the dream\nremain unsolved.\nThat the dream actually has a secret meaning, which turns out to be the\nfulfilment of a wish, must be proved afresh for every case by means of\nan analysis. I therefore select several dreams which have painful\ncontents and attempt an analysis of them. They are partly dreams of\nhysterical subjects, which require long preliminary statements, and now\nand then also an examination of the psychic processes which occur in\nhysteria. I cannot, however, avoid this added difficulty in the\nexposition.\nWhen I give a psychoneurotic patient analytical treatment, dreams are\nalways, as I have said, the subject of our discussion. It must,\ntherefore, give him all the psychological explanations through whose aid\nI myself have come to an understanding of his symptoms, and here I\nundergo an unsparing criticism, which is perhaps not less keen than that\nI must expect from my colleagues. Contradiction of the thesis that all\ndreams are the fulfilments of wishes is raised by my patients with\nperfect regularity. Here are several examples of the dream material\nwhich is offered me to refute this position.\n\u201cYou always tell me that the dream is a wish fulfilled,\u201d begins a clever\nlady patient. \u201cNow I shall tell you a dream in which the content is\nquite the opposite, in which a wish of mine is _not_ fulfilled. How do\nyou reconcile that with your theory? The dream is as follows:\u2014\n\u201c_I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smoked\nsalmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sunday\nafternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone to\nsome caterers, but the telephone is out of order. Thus I must resign my\nwish to give a supper._\u201d\nI answer, of course, that only the analysis can decide the meaning of\nthis dream, although I admit that at first sight it seems sensible and\ncoherent, and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfilment. \u201cBut what\noccurrence has given rise to this dream?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou know that the\nstimulus for a dream always lies among the experiences of the preceding\nday.\u201d\n_Analysis._\u2014The husband of the patient, an upright and conscientious\nwholesale butcher, had told her the day before that he is growing too\nfat, and that he must, therefore, begin treatment for obesity. He was\ngoing to get up early, take exercise, keep to a strict diet, and above\nall accept no more invitations to suppers. She proceeds laughingly to\nrelate how her husband at an inn table had made the acquaintance of an\nartist, who insisted upon painting his portrait because he, the painter,\nhad never found such an expressive head. But her husband had answered in\nhis rough way, that he was very thankful for the honour, but that he was\nquite convinced that a portion of the backside of a pretty young girl\nwould please the artist better than his whole face.[AI] She said that\nshe was at the time very much in love with her husband, and teased him a\ngood deal. She had also asked him not to send her any caviare. What does\nthat mean?\nAs a matter of fact, she had wanted for a long time to eat a caviare\nsandwich every forenoon, but had grudged herself the expense. Of course,\nshe would at once get the caviare from her husband, as soon as she asked\nhim for it. But she had begged him, on the contrary, not to send her the\ncaviare, in order that she might tease him about it longer.\nThis explanation seems far-fetched to me. Unadmitted motives are in the\nhabit of hiding behind such unsatisfactory explanations. We are reminded\nof subjects hypnotised by Bernheim, who carried out a posthypnotic\norder, and who, upon being asked for their motives, instead of\nanswering: \u201cI do not know why I did that,\u201d had to invent a reason that\nwas obviously inadequate. Something similar is probably the case with\nthe caviare of my patient. I see that she is compelled to create an\nunfulfilled wish in life. Her dream also shows the reproduction of the\nwish as accomplished. But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?\nThe ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of the\ndream. I beg for more. After a short pause, which corresponds to the\novercoming of a resistance, she reports further that the day before she\nhad made a visit to a friend, of whom she is really jealous, because her\nhusband is always praising this woman so much. Fortunately, this friend\nis very lean and thin, and her husband likes well-rounded figures. Now\nof what did this lean friend speak? Naturally of her wish to become\nsomewhat stouter. She also asked my patient: \u201cWhen are you going to\ninvite us again? You always have such a good table.\u201d\nNow the meaning of the dream is clear. I may say to the patient: \u201cIt is\njust as though you had thought at the time of the request: \u2018Of course,\nI\u2019ll invite you, so you can eat yourself fat at my house and become\nstill more pleasing to my husband. I would rather give no more suppers.\u2019\nThe dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, thereby\nfulfilling your wish not to contribute anything to the rounding out of\nyour friend\u2019s figure. The resolution of your husband to refuse\ninvitations to supper for the sake of getting thin teaches you that one\ngrows fat on the things served in company.\u201d Now only some conversation\nis necessary to confirm the solution. The smoked salmon in the dream has\nnot yet been traced. \u201cHow did the salmon mentioned in the dream occur to\nyou?\u201d \u201cSmoked salmon is the favourite dish of this friend,\u201d she\nanswered. I happen to know the lady, and may corroborate this by saying\nthat she grudges herself the salmon just as much as my patient grudges\nherself the caviare.\nThe dream admits of still another and more exact interpretation, which\nis necessitated only by a subordinate circumstance. The two\ninterpretations do not contradict one another, but rather cover each\nother and furnish a neat example of the usual ambiguity of dreams as\nwell as of all other psychopathological formations. We have seen that at\nthe same time that she dreams of the denial of the wish, the patient is\nin reality occupied in securing an unfulfilled wish (the caviare\nsandwiches). Her friend, too, had expressed a wish, namely, to get\nfatter, and it would not surprise us if our lady had dreamt that the\nwish of the friend was not being fulfilled. For it is her own wish that\na wish of her friend\u2019s\u2014for increase in weight\u2014should not be fulfilled.\nInstead of this, however, she dreams that one of her own wishes is not\nfulfilled. The dream becomes capable of a new interpretation, if in the\ndream she does not intend herself, but her friend, if she has put\nherself in the place of her friend, or, as we may say, has identified\nherself with her friend.\nI think she has actually done this, and as a sign of this identification\nshe has created an unfulfilled wish in reality. But what is the meaning\nof this hysterical identification? To clear this up a thorough\nexposition is necessary. Identification is a highly important factor in\nthe mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled\nin their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the\nexperiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it\nwere, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by\nmeans of their own personalities alone. It will here be objected that\nthis is well-known hysterical imitation, the ability of hysteric\nsubjects to copy all the symptoms which impress them when they occur in\nothers, as though their pity were stimulated to the point of\nreproduction. But this only indicates the way in which the psychic\nprocess is discharged in hysterical imitation; the way in which a\npsychic act proceeds and the act itself are two different things. The\nlatter is slightly more complicated than one is apt to imagine the\nimitation of hysterical subjects to be: it corresponds to an unconscious\nconcluded process, as an example will show. The physician who has a\nfemale patient with a particular kind of twitching, lodged in the\ncompany of other patients in the same room of the hospital, is not\nsurprised when some morning he learns that this peculiar hysterical\nattack has found imitations. He simply says to himself: The others have\nseen her and have done likewise: that is psychic infection. Yes, but\npsychic infection proceeds in somewhat the following manner: As a rule,\npatients know more about one another than the physician knows about each\nof them, and they are concerned about each other when the visit of the\ndoctor is over. Some of them have an attack to-day: soon it is known\namong the rest that a letter from home, a return of love-sickness or the\nlike, is the cause of it. Their sympathy is aroused, and the following\nsyllogism, which does not reach consciousness, is completed in them: \u201cIf\nit is possible to have this kind of an attack from such causes, I too\nmay have this kind of an attack, for I have the same reasons.\u201d If this\nwere a cycle capable of becoming conscious, it would perhaps express\nitself in _fear_ of getting the same attack; but it takes place in\nanother psychic sphere, and, therefore, ends in the realisation of the\ndreaded symptom. Identification is therefore not a simple imitation, but\na sympathy based upon the same etiological claim; it expresses an \u201cas\nthough,\u201d and refers to some common quality which has remained in the\nunconscious.\nIdentification is most often used in hysteria to express sexual\ncommunity. An hysterical woman identifies herself most readily\u2014although\nnot exclusively\u2014with persons with whom she has had sexual relations, or\nwho have sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself. Language\ntakes such a conception into consideration: two lovers are \u201cone.\u201d In the\nhysterical phantasy, as well as in the dream, it is sufficient for the\nidentification if one thinks of sexual relations, whether or not they\nbecome real. The patient, then, only follows the rules of the hysterical\nthought processes when she gives expression to her jealousy of her\nfriend (which, moreover, she herself admits to be unjustified, in that\nshe puts herself in her place and identifies herself with her by\ncreating a symptom\u2014the denied wish). I might further clarify the process\nspecifically as follows: She puts herself in the place of her friend in\nthe dream, because her friend has taken her own place in relation to her\nhusband, and because she would like to take her friend\u2019s place in the\nesteem of her husband.[AJ]\nThe contradiction to my theory of dreams in the case of another female\npatient, the most witty among all my dreamers, was solved in a simpler\nmanner, although according to the scheme that the non-fulfilment of one\nwish signifies the fulfilment of another. I had one day explained to her\nthat the dream is a wish-fulfilment. The next day she brought me a dream\nto the effect that she was travelling with her mother-inlaw to their\ncommon summer resort. Now I knew that she had struggled violently\nagainst spending the summer in the neighbourhood of her mother-in-law. I\nalso knew that she had luckily avoided her mother-in-law by renting an\nestate in a far-distant country resort. Now the dream reversed this\nwished-for solution; was not this in the flattest contradiction to my\ntheory of wish-fulfilment in the dream? Certainly, it was only necessary\nto draw the inferences from this dream in order to get at its\ninterpretation. According to this dream, I was in the wrong. _It was\nthus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dream\nshowed her as fulfilled._ But the wish that I should be in the wrong,\nwhich was fulfilled in the theme of the country home, referred to a more\nserious matter. At that time I had made up my mind, from the material\nfurnished by her analysis, that something of significance for her\nillness must have occurred at a certain time in her life. She had denied\nit because it was not present in her memory. We soon came to see that I\nwas in the right. Her wish that I should be in the wrong, which is\ntransformed into the dream, thus corresponded to the justifiable wish\nthat those things, which at the time had only been suspected, had never\noccurred at all.\nWithout an analysis, and merely by means of an assumption, I took the\nliberty of interpreting a little occurrence in the case of a friend, who\nhad been my colleague through the eight classes of the Gymnasium. He\nonce heard a lecture of mine delivered to a small assemblage, on the\nnovel subject of the dream as the fulfilment of a wish. He went home,\ndreamt _that he had lost all his suits_\u2014he was a lawyer\u2014and then\ncomplained to me about it. I took refuge in the evasion: \u201cOne can\u2019t win\nall one\u2019s suits,\u201d but I thought to myself: \u201cIf for eight years I sat as\nPrimus on the first bench, while he moved around somewhere in the middle\nof the class, may he not naturally have had a wish from his boyhood days\nthat I, too, might for once completely disgrace myself?\u201d\nIn the same way another dream of a more gloomy character was offered me\nby a female patient as a contradiction to my theory of the wish-dream.\nThe patient, a young girl, began as follows: \u201cYou remember that my\nsister has now only one boy, Charles: she lost the elder one, Otto,\nwhile I was still at her house. Otto was my favourite; it was I who\nreally brought him up. I like the other little fellow, too, but of\ncourse not nearly as much as the dead one. Now I dreamt last night that\n_I saw Charles lying dead before me_. _He was lying in his little\ncoffin, his hands folded: there were candles all about, and, in short,\nit was just like the time of little Otto\u2019s death, which shocked me so\nprofoundly._ Now tell me, what does this mean? You know me: am I really\nbad enough to wish my sister to lose the only child she has left? Or\ndoes the dream mean that I wish Charles to be dead rather than Otto,\nwhom I like so much better?\u201d\nI assured her that this interpretation was impossible. After some\nreflection I was able to give her the interpretation of the dream, which\nI subsequently made her confirm.\nHaving become an orphan at an early age, the girl had been brought up in\nthe house of a much older sister, and had met among the friends and\nvisitors who came to the house, a man who made a lasting impression upon\nher heart. It looked for a time as though these barely expressed\nrelations were to end in marriage, but this happy culmination was\nfrustrated by the sister, whose motives have never found a complete\nexplanation. After the break, the man who was loved by our patient\navoided the house: she herself became independent some time after little\nOtto\u2019s death, to whom her affection had now turned. But she did not\nsucceed in freeing herself from the inclination for her sister\u2019s friend\nin which she had become involved. Her pride commanded her to avoid him;\nbut it was impossible for her to transfer her love to the other suitors\nwho presented themselves in order. Whenever the man whom she loved, who\nwas a member of the literary profession, announced a lecture anywhere,\nshe was sure to be found in the audience; she also seized every other\nopportunity to see him from a distance unobserved by him. I remembered\nthat on the day before she had told me that the Professor was going to a\ncertain concert, and that she was also going there, in order to enjoy\nthe sight of him. This was on the day of the dream; and the concert was\nto take place on the day on which she told me the dream. I could now\neasily see the correct interpretation, and I asked her whether she could\nthink of any event which had happened after the death of little Otto.\nShe answered immediately: \u201cCertainly; at that time the Professor\nreturned after a long absence, and I saw him once more beside the coffin\nof little Otto.\u201d It was exactly as I had expected. I interpreted the\ndream in the following manner: If now the other boy were to die, the\nsame thing would be repeated. You would spend the day with your sister,\nthe Professor would surely come in order to offer condolence, and you\nwould see him again under the same circumstances as at that time. The\ndream signifies nothing but this wish of yours to see him again, against\nwhich you are fighting inwardly. I know that you are carrying the ticket\nfor to-day\u2019s concert in your bag. Your dream is a dream of impatience;\nit has anticipated the meeting which is to take place to-day by several\nhours.\nIn order to disguise her wish she had obviously selected a situation in\nwhich wishes of that sort are commonly suppressed\u2014a situation which is\nso filled with sorrow that love is not thought of. And yet, it is very\neasily probable that even in the actual situation at the bier of the\nsecond, more dearly loved boy, which the dream copied faithfully, she\nhad not been able to suppress her feelings of affection for the visitor\nwhom she had missed for so long a time.\nA different explanation was found in the case of a similar dream of\nanother female patient, who was distinguished in her earlier years by\nher quick wit and her cheerful demeanour, and who still showed these\nqualities at least in the notions which occurred to her in the course of\ntreatment. In connection with a longer dream, it seemed to this lady\nthat she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter lying dead before her in a\nbox. She was strongly inclined to convert this dream-image into an\nobjection to the theory of wish-fulfilment, but herself suspected that\nthe detail of the box must lead to a different conception of the\ndream.[AK] In the course of the analysis it occurred to her that on the\nevening before, the conversation of the company had turned upon the\nEnglish word \u201cbox,\u201d and upon the numerous translations of it into\nGerman, such as box, theatre box, chest, box on the ear, &c. From other\ncomponents of the same dream it is now possible to add that the lady had\nguessed the relationship between the English word \u201cbox\u201d and the German\n_B\u00fcchse_, and had then been haunted by the memory that _B\u00fcchse_ (as well\nas \u201cbox\u201d) is used in vulgar speech to designate the female genital\norgan. It was therefore possible, making a certain allowance for her\nnotions on the subject of topographical anatomy, to assume that the\nchild in the box signified a child in the womb of the mother. At this\nstage of the explanation she no longer denied that the picture of the\ndream really corresponded to one of her wishes. Like so many other young\nwomen, she was by no means happy when she became pregnant, and admitted\nto me more than once the wish that her child might die before its birth;\nin a fit of anger following a violent scene with her husband she had\neven struck her abdomen with her fists in order to hit the child within.\nThe dead child was, therefore, really the fulfilment of a wish, but a\nwish which had been put aside for fifteen years, and it is not\nsurprising that the fulfilment of the wish was no longer recognised\nafter so long an interval. For there had been many changes meanwhile.\nThe group of dreams to which the two last mentioned belong, having as\ncontent the death of beloved relatives, will be considered again under\nthe head of \u201cTypical Dreams.\u201d I shall there be able to show by new\nexamples that in spite of their undesirable content, all these dreams\nmust be interpreted as wish-fulfilments. For the following dream, which\nagain was told me in order to deter me from a hasty generalisation of\nthe theory of wishing in dreams, I am indebted, not to a patient, but to\nan intelligent jurist of my acquaintance. \u201c_I dream_,\u201d my informant\ntells me, \u201c_that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on my\narm_. _Here a closed wagon is waiting, a gentleman steps up to me, gives\nhis authority as an agent of the police, and demands that I should\nfollow him. I only ask for time in which to arrange my affairs._ Can you\npossibly suppose this is a wish of mine to be arrested?\u201d \u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d I must admit. \u201cDo you happen to know upon what charge you were\narrested?\u201d \u201cYes; I believe for infanticide.\u201d \u201cInfanticide? But you know\nthat only a mother can commit this crime upon her newly born child?\u201d\n\u201cThat is true.\u201d[AL] \u201cAnd under what circumstances did you dream; what\nhappened on the evening before?\u201d \u201cI would rather not tell you that; it\nis a delicate matter.\u201d \u201cBut I must have it, otherwise we must forgo the\ninterpretation of the dream.\u201d \u201cWell, then, I will tell you. I spent the\nnight, not at home, but at the house of a lady who means very much to\nme. When we awoke in the morning, something again passed between us.\nThen I went to sleep again, and dreamt what I have told you.\u201d \u201cThe woman\nis married?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd you do not wish her to conceive a child?\u201d \u201cNo;\nthat might betray us.\u201d \u201cThen you do not practise normal coitus?\u201d \u201cI take\nthe precaution to withdraw before ejaculation.\u201d \u201cAm I permitted to\nassume that you did this trick several times during the night, and that\nin the morning you were not quite sure whether you had succeeded?\u201d \u201cThat\nmight be the case.\u201d \u201cThen your dream is the fulfilment of a wish. By\nmeans of it you secure the assurance that you have not begotten a child,\nor, what amounts to the same thing, that you have killed a child. I can\neasily demonstrate the connecting links. Do you remember, a few days ago\nwe were talking about the distress of matrimony (Ehenot), and about the\ninconsistency of permitting the practice of coitus as long as no\nimpregnation takes place, while every delinquency after the ovum and the\nsemen meet and a f\u0153tus is formed is punished as a crime? In connection\nwith this, we also recalled the medi\u00e6val controversy about the moment of\ntime at which the soul is really lodged in the f\u0153tus, since the concept\nof murder becomes admissible only from that point on. Doubtless you also\nknow the gruesome poem by Lenau, which puts infanticide and the\nprevention of children on the same plane.\u201d \u201cStrangely enough, I had\nhappened to think of Lenau during the afternoon.\u201d \u201cAnother echo of your\ndream. And now I shall demonstrate to you another subordinate\nwish-fulfilment in your dream. You walk in front of your house with the\nlady on your arm. So you take her home, instead of spending the night at\nher house, as you do in actuality. The fact that the wish-fulfilment,\nwhich is the essence of the dream, disguises itself in such an\nunpleasant form, has perhaps more than one reason. From my essay on the\netiology of anxiety neuroses, you will see that I note interrupted\ncoitus as one of the factors which cause the development of neurotic\nfear. It would be consistent with this that if after repeated\ncohabitation of the kind mentioned you should be left in an\nuncomfortable mood, which now becomes an element in the composition of\nyour dream. You also make use of this unpleasant state of mind to\nconceal the wish-fulfilment. Furthermore, the mention of infanticide has\nnot yet been explained. Why does this crime, which is peculiar to\nfemales, occur to you?\u201d \u201cI shall confess to you that I was involved in\nsuch an affair years ago. Through my fault a girl tried to protect\nherself from the consequences of a _liaison_ with me by securing an\nabortion. I had nothing to do with carrying out the plan, but I was\nnaturally for a long time worried lest the affair might be discovered.\u201d\n\u201cI understand; this recollection furnished a second reason why the\nsupposition that you had done your trick badly must have been painful to\nyou.\u201d\nA young physician, who had heard this dream of my colleague when it was\ntold, must have felt implicated by it, for he hastened to imitate it in\na dream of his own, applying its mode of thinking to another subject.\nThe day before he had handed in a declaration of his income, which was\nperfectly honest, because he had little to declare. He dreamt that an\nacquaintance of his came from a meeting of the tax commission and\ninformed him that all the other declarations of income had passed\nuncontested, but that his own had awakened general suspicion, and that\nhe would be punished with a heavy fine. The dream is a poorly-concealed\nfulfilment of the wish to be known as a physician with a large income.\nIt likewise recalls the story of the young girl who was advised against\naccepting her suitor because he was a man of quick temper who would\nsurely treat her to blows after they were married. The answer of the\ngirl was: \u201cI wish he _would_ strike me!\u201d Her wish to be married is so\nstrong that she takes into the bargain the discomfort which is said to\nbe connected with matrimony, and which is predicted for her, and even\nraises it to a wish.\nIf I group the very frequently occurring dreams of this sort, which seem\nflatly to contradict my theory, in that they contain the denial of a\nwish or some occurrence decidedly unwished for, under the head of\n\u201ccounter wish-dreams,\u201d I observe that they may all be referred to two\nprinciples, of which one has not yet been mentioned, although it plays a\nlarge part in the dreams of human beings. One of the motives inspiring\nthese dreams is the wish that I should appear in the wrong. These dreams\nregularly occur in the course of my treatment if the patient shows a\nresistance against me, and I can count with a large degree of certainty\nupon causing such a dream after I have once explained to the patient my\ntheory that the dream is a wish-fulfilment.[AM] I may even expect this\nto be the case in a dream merely in order to fulfil the wish that I may\nappear in the wrong. The last dream which I shall tell from those\noccurring in the course of treatment again shows this very thing. A\nyoung girl who has struggled hard to continue my treatment, against the\nwill of her relatives and the authorities whom she has consulted, dreams\nas follows: _She is forbidden at home to come to me any more. She then\nreminds me of the promise I made her to treat her for nothing if\nnecessary, and I say to her: \u201cI can show no consideration in money\nmatters.\u201d_\nIt is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfilment of a\nwish, but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, the\nsolution of which helps also to solve the first. Where does she get the\nwords which she puts into my mouth? Of course I have never told her\nanything like that, but one of her brothers, the very one who has the\ngreatest influence over her, has been kind enough to make this remark\nabout me. It is then the purpose of the dream that this brother should\nremain in the right; and she does not try to justify this brother merely\nin the dream; it is her purpose in life and the motive for her being\nill.\nThe other motive for counter wish-dreams is so clear that there is\ndanger of overlooking it, as for some time happened in my own case. In\nthe sexual make-up of many people there is a masochistic component,\nwhich has arisen through the conversion of the aggressive, sadistic\ncomponent into its opposite. Such people are called \u201cideal\u201d masochists,\nif they seek pleasure not in the bodily pain which may be inflicted upon\nthem, but in humiliation and in chastisement of the soul. It is obvious\nthat such persons can have counter wish-dreams and disagreeable dreams,\nwhich, however, for them are nothing but wish-fulfilments, affording\nsatisfaction for their masochistic inclinations. Here is such a dream. A\nyoung man, who has in earlier years tormented his elder brother, towards\nwhom he was homosexually inclined, but who has undergone a complete\nchange of character, has the following dream, which consists of three\nparts: (1) _He is \u201cinsulted\u201d by his brother._ (2) _Two adults are\ncaressing each other with homosexual intentions._ (3) _His brother has\nsold the enterprise whose management the young man reserved for his own\nfuture._ He awakens from the last-mentioned dream with the most\nunpleasant feelings, and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, which might\nbe translated: It would serve me quite right if my brother were to make\nthat sale against my interest, as a punishment for all the torments\nwhich he has suffered at my hands.\nI hope that the above discussion and examples will suffice\u2014until further\nobjection can be raised\u2014to make it seem credible that even dreams with a\npainful content are to be analysed as the fulfilments of wishes. Nor\nwill it seem a matter of chance that in the course of interpretation one\nalways happens upon subjects of which one does not like to speak or\nthink. The disagreeable sensation which such dreams arouse is simply\nidentical with the antipathy which endeavours\u2014usually with success\u2014to\nrestrain us from the treatment or discussion of such subjects, and which\nmust be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of its unpleasantness, we\nfind it necessary to take the matter in hand. But this disagreeable\nsensation, which occurs also in dreams, does not preclude the existence\nof a wish; everyone has wishes which he would not like to tell to\nothers, which he does not want to admit even to himself. We are, on\nother grounds, justified in connecting the disagreeable character of all\nthese dreams with the fact of dream disfigurement, and in concluding\nthat these dreams are distorted, and that the wish-fulfilment in them is\ndisguised until recognition is impossible for no other reason than that\na repugnance, a will to suppress, exists in relation to the\nsubject-matter of the dream or in relation to the wish which the dream\ncreates. Dream disfigurement, then, turns out in reality to be an act of\nthe censor. We shall take into consideration everything which the\nanalysis of disagreeable dreams has brought to light if we reword our\nformula as follows: _The dream is the (disguised) fulfilment of a\n(suppressed, repressed) wish._[AN]\nNow there still remain as a particular species of dreams with painful\ncontent, dreams of anxiety, the inclusion of which under dreams of\nwishing will find least acceptance with the uninitiated. But I can\nsettle the problem of anxiety dreams in very short order; for what they\nmay reveal is not a new aspect of the dream problem; it is a question in\ntheir case of understanding neurotic anxiety in general. The fear which\nwe experience in the dream is only seemingly explained by the dream\ncontent. If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we become\naware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content than\nthe fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobia\ndepends. For example, it is true that it is possible to fall out of a\nwindow, and that some care must be exercised when one is near a window,\nbut it is inexplicable why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is so\ngreat, and why it follows its victims to an extent so much greater than\nis warranted by its origin. The same explanation, then, which applies to\nthe phobia applies also to the dream of anxiety. In both cases the\nanxiety is only superficially attached to the idea which accompanies it\nand comes from another source.\nOn account of the intimate relation of dream fear to neurotic fear,\ndiscussion of the former obliges me to refer to the latter. In a little\nessay on \u201cThe Anxiety Neurosis,\u201d[AO] I maintained that neurotic fear has\nits origin in the sexual life, and corresponds to a libido which has\nbeen turned away from its object and has not succeeded in being applied.\nFrom this formula, which has since proved its validity more and more\nclearly, we may deduce the conclusion that the content of anxiety dreams\nis of a sexual nature, the libido belonging to which content has been\ntransformed into fear. Later on I shall have opportunity to support this\nassertion by the analysis of several dreams of neurotics. I shall have\noccasion to revert to the determinations in anxiety dreams and their\ncompatibility with the theory of wish-fulfilment when I again attempt to\napproach the theory of dreams.\nV\nTHE MATERIAL AND SOURCES OF DREAMS\nAfter coming to realise from the analysis of the dream of Irma\u2019s\ninjection that the dream is the fulfilment of a wish, our interest was\nnext directed to ascertaining whether we had thus discovered a universal\ncharacteristic of the dream, and for the time being we put aside every\nother question which may have been aroused in the course of that\ninterpretation. Now that we have reached the goal upon one of these\npaths, we may turn back and select a new starting-point for our\nexcursions among the problems of the dream, even though we may lose\nsight for a time of the theme of wish-fulfilment, which has been as yet\nby no means exhaustively treated.\nNow that we are able, by applying our process of interpretation, to\ndiscover a _latent_ dream content which far surpasses the _manifest_\ndream content in point of significance, we are impelled to take up the\nindividual dream problems afresh, in order to see whether the riddles\nand contradictions which seemed, when we had only the manifest content,\nbeyond our reach may not be solved for us satisfactorily.\nThe statements of the authors concerning the relation of the dream to\nwaking life, as well as concerning the source of the dream material,\nhave been given at length in the introductory chapter. We may recall\nthat there are three peculiarities of recollection in the dreams, which\nhave been often remarked but never explained:\n1. That the dream distinctly prefers impressions of the few days\npreceding; (Robert,[55] Str\u00fcmpell,[66] Hildebrandt,[35] also Weed-Hallam\n[33]).\n2. That it makes its selection according to principles other than those\nof our waking memory, in that it recalls not what is essential and\nimportant, but what is subordinate and disregarded (_cf._ p. 13).\n3. That it has at its disposal the earliest impressions of our\nchildhood, and brings to light details from this period of life which\nagain seem trivial to us, and which in waking life were considered long\nago forgotten.[AP]\nThese peculiarities in the selection of the dream material have of\ncourse been observed by the authors in connection with the manifest\ndream content.\n(_a_) _Recent and Indifferent Impressions in the Dream_\nIf I now consult my own experience concerning the source of the elements\nwhich appear in the dream, I must at once express the opinion that some\nreference to the experiences of _the day which has most recently passed_\nis to be found in every dream. Whatever dream I take up, whether my own\nor another\u2019s, this experience is always reaffirmed. Knowing this fact, I\ncan usually begin the work of interpretation by trying to learn the\nexperience of the previous day which has stimulated the dream; for many\ncases, indeed, this is the quickest way. In the case of the two dreams\nwhich I have subjected to close analysis in the preceding chapter (of\nIrma\u2019s injection, and of my uncle with the yellow beard) the reference\nto the previous day is so obvious that it needs no further elucidation.\nBut in order to show that this reference may be regularly demonstrated,\nI shall examine a portion of my own dream chronicle. I shall report the\ndreams only so far as is necessary for the discovery of the dream\nstimulus in question.\n1. I make a visit at a house where I am admitted only with difficulty,\n&c., and meanwhile I keep a woman _waiting_ for me.\n_Source._\u2014A conversation in the evening with a female relative to the\neffect that she would have to _wait_ for some aid which she demanded\nuntil, &c.\n2. I have written a _monograph_ about a certain (obscure) species of\nplant.\n_Source._\u2014I have seen in the show-window of a book store a _monograph_\nupon the genus cyclamen.\n3. I see two women on the street, _mother and daughter_, the latter of\nwhom is my patient.\n_Source._\u2014A female patient who is under treatment has told me what\ndifficulties her _mother_ puts in the way of her continuing the\ntreatment.\n4. At the book store of S. and R. I subscribe to a periodical which\ncosts _20 florins_ annually.\n_Source._\u2014During the day my wife has reminded me that I still owe her\n_20 florins_ of her weekly allowance.\n5. I receive a _communication_, in which I am treated as a member, from\nthe Social Democratic Committee.\n_Source._\u2014I have received _communications_ simultaneously from the\nLiberal Committee on Elections and from the president of the\nHumanitarian Society, of which I am really a member.\n6. A man on _a steep rock in the middle of the ocean_, after the manner\nof Boecklin.\n_Source._\u2014_Dreyfus on Devil\u2019s Island_; at the same time news from my\nrelatives in _England_, &c.\nThe question might be raised, whether the dream is invariably connected\nwith the events of the previous day, or whether the reference may be\nextended to impressions from a longer space of time in the immediate\npast. Probably this matter cannot claim primary importance, but I should\nlike to decide in favour of the exclusive priority of the day before the\ndream (the dream-day). As often as I thought I had found a case where an\nimpression of two or three days before had been the source of the dream,\nI could convince myself, after careful investigation, that this\nimpression had been remembered the day before, that a demonstrable\nreproduction had been interpolated between the day of the event and the\ntime of the dream, and, furthermore, I was able to point out the recent\noccasion upon which the recollection of the old impression might have\noccurred. On the other hand, I was unable to convince myself that a\nregular interval (H. Swoboda calls the first one of this kind eighteen\nhours) of biological significance occurs between the stimulating\nimpression of the day and its repetition in the dream.[AQ]\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the stimulus for every dream is to\nbe found among those experiences \u201cupon which one has not yet slept\u201d for\na night.\nThus the impressions of the immediate past (with the exception of the\nday before the night of the dream) stand in no different relation to the\ndream content from those of times which are as far removed in the past\nas you please. The dream may select its material from all times of life,\nprovided only, that a chain of thought starting from one of the\nexperiences of the day of the dream (one of the \u201crecent\u201d impressions)\nreaches back to these earlier ones.\nBut why this preference for recent impressions? We shall reach some\nconjectures on this point if we subject one of the dreams already\nmentioned to a more exact analysis. I select the dream about the\nmonograph.\n_Content of the dream.\u2014I have written a monograph upon a certain plant.\nThe book lies before me, I am just turning over a folded coloured plate.\nA dried specimen of the plant is bound with every copy, as though from a\nherbarium._\n_Analysis._\u2014In the forenoon I saw in the show-window of a book store a\nbook entitled, _The Genus Cyclamen_, apparently a monograph on this\nplant.\nThe cyclamen is the favourite flower of my wife. I reproach myself for\nso seldom thinking to bring her flowers, as she wishes. In connection\nwith the theme \u201cbringing flowers,\u201d I am reminded of a story which I\nrecently told in a circle of friends to prove my assertion that\nforgetting is very often the purpose of the unconscious, and that in any\ncase it warrants a conclusion as to the secret disposition of the person\nwho forgets. A young woman who is accustomed to receive a bunch of\nflowers from her husband on her birthday, misses this token of affection\non a festive occasion of this sort, and thereupon bursts into tears. The\nhusband comes up, and is unable to account for her tears until she tells\nhim, \u201cTo-day is my birthday.\u201d He strikes his forehead and cries, \u201cWhy, I\nhad completely forgotten it,\u201d and wants to go out to get her some\nflowers. But she is not to be consoled, for she sees in the\nforgetfulness of her husband a proof that she does not play the same\npart in his thoughts as formerly. This Mrs. L. met my wife two days\nbefore, and told her that she was feeling well, and asked about me. She\nwas under my treatment years ago.\nSupplementary facts: I once actually wrote something like a monograph on\na plant, namely, an essay on the coca plant, which drew the attention of\nK. Koller to the an\u00e6sthetic properties of cocaine. I had hinted at this\nuse of the alkaloid in my publication, but I was not sufficiently\nthorough to pursue the matter further. This suggests that on the\nforenoon of the day after the dream (for the interpretation of which I\ndid not find time until the evening) I had thought of cocaine in a kind\nof day phantasy. In case I should ever be afflicted with glaucoma, I was\ngoing to go to Berlin, and there have myself operated upon, incognito,\nat the house of my Berlin friend, by a physician whom he would recommend\nto me. The surgeon, who would not know upon whom he was operating, would\nboast as usual how easy these operations had become since the\nintroduction of cocaine; I would not betray by a single sign that I had\nhad a share in making this discovery. With this phantasy were connected\nthoughts of how difficult it really is for a doctor to claim the medical\nservices of a colleague for his own person. I should be able to pay the\nBerlin eye specialist, who did not know me, like anyone else. Only after\nrecalling this day-dream do I realise that the recollection of a\ndefinite experience is concealed behind it. Shortly after Koller\u2019s\ndiscovery my father had, in fact, become ill with glaucoma; he was\noperated upon by my friend, the eye specialist, Dr. Koenigstein. Dr.\nKoller attended to the cocaine an\u00e6sthetisation, and thereupon made the\nremark that all three of the persons who had shared in the introduction\nof cocaine had been brought together on one case.\nI now proceed to think of the time when I was last reminded of this\naffair about the cocaine. This was a few days before, when I received a\n_Festschrift_, with whose publication grateful scholars had commemorated\nthe anniversary of their teacher and laboratory director. Among the\nhonours ascribed to persons connected with the laboratory, I found a\nnotice to the effect that the discovery of the an\u00e6sthetic properties of\ncocaine had been made there by K. Koller. Now I suddenly become aware\nthat the dream is connected with an experience of the previous evening.\nI had just accompanied Dr. Koenigstein to his home, and had spoken to\nhim about a matter which strongly arouses my interest whenever it is\nmentioned. While I was talking with him in the vestibule, Professor\nG\u00e4rtner and his young wife came up. I could not refrain from\ncongratulating them both upon their healthy appearance. Now Professor\nG\u00e4rtner is one of the authors of the _Festschrift_ of which I have just\nspoken, and may well have recalled it to me. Likewise Mrs. L., whose\nbirthday disappointment I have referred to, had been mentioned, in\nanother connection, to be sure, in the conversation with Dr.\nKoenigstein.\nI shall now try to explain the other determinations of the dream\ncontent. _A dried specimen_ of the plant accompanies the monograph as\nthough it were a _herbarium_. A recollection of the _gymnasium_ (school)\nis connected with the herbarium. The director of our _gymnasium_ once\ncalled the scholars of the higher classes together in order to have them\ninspect and clean the herbarium. Small worms had been found\u2014bookworms.\nThe director did not seem to have much confidence in my help, for he\nleft only a few leaves for me. I know to this day that there were\ncrucifers on them. My interest in botany was never very great. At my\npreliminary examination in botany, I was required to identify a\ncrucifer, and did not recognise it. I would have fared badly if my\ntheoretical knowledge had not helped me out. Crucifers suggest\ncomposites. The artichoke is really a composite, and the one which I\nmight call my favourite flower. My wife, who is more thoughtful than I,\noften brings this favourite flower of mine home from the market.\nI see the monograph which I have written lying before me. This, too, is\nnot without its reference. The friend whom I pictured wrote to me\nyesterday from Berlin: \u201cI think a great deal about your dream book. _I\nsee it lying before me finished, and am turning over its leaves._\u201d How I\nenvied him this prophetic power! If I could only see it lying already\nfinished before me!\n_The folded Coloured Plate._\u2014While I was a student of medicine, I\nsuffered much from a fondness for studying in _monographs_ exclusively.\nIn spite of my limited means, I subscribed to a number of the medical\narchives, in which the coloured plates gave me much delight. I was proud\nof this inclination for thoroughness. So, when I began to publish on my\nown account, I had to draw the plates for my own treatises, and I\nremember one of them turned out so badly that a kindly-disposed\ncolleague ridiculed me for it. This suggests, I don\u2019t know exactly how,\na very early memory from my youth. My father once thought it would be a\njoke to hand over a book with _coloured plates_ (_Description of a\nJourney in Persia_) to me and my eldest sister for destruction. This was\nhardly to be justified from an educational point of view. I was at the\ntime five years old, and my sister three, and the picture of our\nblissfully tearing this book to pieces (like an artichoke, I must add,\nleaf by leaf) is almost the only one from this time of life which has\nremained fresh in my memory. When I afterwards became a student, I\ndeveloped a distinct fondness for collecting and possessing books (an\nanalogy to the inclination for studying from monographs, a hobby which\noccurs in the dream thoughts with reference to cyclamen and artichoke).\nI became a book-worm (_cf._ herbarium). I have always referred this\nfirst passion of my life\u2014since I am engaging in retrospect\u2014to this\nchildhood impression, or rather I have recognised in this childish scene\na \u201cconcealing recollection\u201d for my subsequent love of books.[AR] Of\ncourse I also learned at an early age that our passions are often our\nsorrows. When I was seventeen years old I had a very respectable bill at\nthe book store, and no means with which to pay it, and my father would\nhardly accept the excuse that my inclination had not been fixed on\nsomething worse. But the mention of this later youthful experience\nimmediately brings me back to my conversation that evening with my\nfriend Dr. Koenigstein. For the talk on the evening of the dream-day\nbrought up the same old reproach that I am too fond of my hobbies.\nFor reasons which do not belong here, I shall not continue the\ninterpretation of this dream, but shall simply indicate the path which\nleads to it. In the course of the interpretation, I was reminded of my\nconversation with Dr. Koenigstein, and indeed of more than one portion\nof it. If I consider the subjects touched upon in this conversation, the\nmeaning of the dream becomes clear to me. All the thought associations\nwhich have been started, about the hobbies of my wife and of myself,\nabout the cocaine, about the difficulty of securing medical treatment\nfrom one\u2019s colleagues, my preference for monographic studies, and my\nneglect of certain subjects such as botany\u2014all this continues and\nconnects with some branch of this widely ramified conversation. The\ndream again takes on the character of a justification, of a pleading for\nmy rights, like the first analysed dream of Irma\u2019s injection; it even\ncontinues the theme which that dream started, and discusses it with the\nnew subject matter which has accrued in the interval between the two\ndreams. Even the apparently indifferent manner of expression of the\ndream receives new importance. The meaning is now: \u201cI am indeed the man\nwho has written that valuable and successful treatise (on cocaine),\u201d\njust as at that time I asserted for my justification: \u201cI am a thorough\nand industrious student;\u201d in both cases, then: \u201cI can afford to do\nthat.\u201d But I may dispense with the further interpretation of the dream,\nbecause my only purpose in reporting it was to examine the relation of\nthe dream content to the experience of the previous day which arouses\nit. As long as I know only the manifest content of this dream, but one\nrelation to a day impression becomes obvious; after I have made the\ninterpretation, a second source of the dream becomes evident in another\nexperience of the same day. The first of these impressions to which the\ndream refers is an indifferent one, a subordinate circumstance. I see a\nbook in a shop window whose title holds me for a moment, and whose\ncontents could hardly interest me. The second experience has great\npsychic value; I have talked earnestly with my friend, the eye\nspecialist, for about an hour, I have made allusions in this\nconversation which must have touched both of us closely, and which\nawakened memories revealing the most diverse feelings of my inner self.\nFurthermore, this conversation was broken off unfinished because some\nfriends joined us. What, now, is the relation of these two impressions\nof the day to each other and to the dream which followed during the next\nnight?\nI find in the manifest content merely an allusion to the indifferent\nimpression, and may thus reaffirm that the dream preferably takes up\ninto its content non-essential experiences. In the dream interpretation,\non the contrary, everything converges upon an important event which is\njustified in demanding attention. If I judge the dream in the only\ncorrect way, according to the latent content which is brought to light\nin the analysis, I have unawares come upon a new and important fact. I\nsee the notion that the dream deals only with the worthless fragments of\ndaily experience shattered; I am compelled also to contradict the\nassertion that our waking psychic life is not continued in the dream,\nand that the dream instead wastes psychic activity upon a trifling\nsubject matter. The opposite is true; what has occupied our minds during\nthe day also dominates our dream thoughts, and we take pains to dream\nonly of such matters as have given us food for thought during the day.\nPerhaps the most obvious explanation for the fact that I dream about\nsome indifferent impression of the day, while the impression which is\njustifiably stirring furnishes the occasion for dreaming, is that this\nagain is a phenomenon of the dream-disfigurement, which we have above\ntraced to a psychic power acting as a censor. The recollection of the\nmonograph on the genus cyclamen is employed as though it were an\nallusion to the conversation with my friend, very much as mention of the\nfriend in the dream of the deferred supper is represented by the\nallusion \u201csmoked salmon.\u201d The only question is, by what intermediate\nsteps does the impression of the monograph come to assume the relation\nof an allusion to the conversation with the eye specialist, since such a\nrelation is not immediately evident. In the example of the deferred\nsupper, the relation is set forth at the outset; \u201csmoked salmon,\u201d as the\nfavourite dish of the friend, belongs at once to the series of\nassociations which the person of the friend would call up in the lady\nwho is dreaming. In our new example we have two separated impressions,\nwhich seem at first glance to have nothing in common except that they\noccur on the same day. The monograph catches my attention in the\nforenoon; I take part in the conversation in the evening. The answer\nsupplied by the analysis is as follows: Such relations between the two\nimpressions do not at first exist, but are established subsequently\nbetween the presentation content of the one impression and the\npresentation content of the other. I have recently emphasised the\ncomponents in this relation in the course of recording the analysis.\nWith the notion of the monograph on cyclamen I should probably associate\nthe idea that cyclamen is my wife\u2019s favourite flower only under some\noutside influence, and this is perhaps the further recollection of the\nbunch of flowers missed by Mrs. L. I do not believe that these\nunderlying thoughts would have been sufficient to call forth a dream.\n\u201cThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\nTo tell us this,\u201d\nas we read in _Hamlet_. But behold! I am reminded in the analysis that\nthe name of the man who interrupted our conversation was G\u00e4rtner\n(Gardener), and that I found his wife in blooming health;[AS] I even\nremember now that one of my female patients, who bears the pretty name\nof Flora, was for a time the main subject of our conversation. It must\nhave happened that I completed the connection between the two events of\nthe day, the indifferent and the exciting one, by means of these links\nfrom the series of associations belonging to the idea of botany. Other\nrelations are then established, that of cocaine, which can with perfect\ncorrectness form a go-between connecting the person of Dr. Koenigstein\nwith the botanical monograph which I have written, and strengthen the\nfusion of the two series of associations into one, so that now a portion\nof the first experience may be used as an allusion to the second.\nI am prepared to find this explanation attacked as arbitrary or\nartificial. What would have happened if Professor G\u00e4rtner and his\nblooming wife had not come up, and if the patient who was talked about\nhad been called, not Flora, but Anna? The answer is easy, however. If\nthese thought-relations had not been present, others would probably have\nbeen selected. It is so easy to establish relations of this sort, as the\njoking questions and conundrums with which we amuse ourselves daily\nsuffice to show. The range of wit is unlimited. To go a step further: if\nit had been impossible to establish interrelations of sufficient\nabundance between the two impressions of the day, the dream would simply\nhave resulted differently; another of the indifferent impressions of the\nday, such as come to us in multitudes and are forgotten, would have\ntaken the place of the monograph in the dream, would have secured a\nconnection with the content of the talk, and would have represented it\nin the dream. Since it was the impression of the monograph and no other\nthat had this fate, this impression was probably the most suitable for\nthe establishment of the connection. One need not be astonished, like\nLessing\u2019s H\u00e4nschen Schlau, because \u201cit is the rich people of the world\nwho possess the most money.\u201d\nStill the psychological process by which, according to our conception,\nthe indifferent experience is substituted for the psychologically\nimportant one, seems odd to us and open to question. In a later chapter\nwe shall undertake the task of making this seemingly incorrect operation\nmore intelligible. We are here concerned only with consequences of this\nprocedure, whose assumption we have been forced to make by the regularly\nrecurring experiences of dream analysis. But the process seems to be\nthat, in the course of those intermediate steps, a displacement\u2014let us\nsay of the psychic accent\u2014has taken place, until ideas that are at first\nweakly charged with intensity, by taking over the charge from ideas\nwhich have a stronger initial intensity, reach a degree of strength,\nwhich enables them to force their way into consciousness. Such\ndisplacements do not at all surprise us when it is a question of the\nbestowal of affects or of the motor actions in general. The fact that\nthe woman who has remained single transfers her affection to animals,\nthat the bachelor becomes a passionate collector, that the soldier\ndefends a scrap of coloured cloth, his flag, with his life-blood, that\nin a love affair a momentary clasping of hands brings bliss, or that in\n_Othello_ a lost handkerchief causes a burst of rage\u2014all these are\nexamples of psychic displacement which seem unquestionable to us. But\nif, in the same manner and according to the same fundamental principles,\na decision is made as to what is to reach our consciousness and what is\nto be withheld from it, that is to say, what we are to think\u2014this\nproduces an impression of morbidity, and we call it an error of thought\nif it occurs in waking life. We may here anticipate the result of a\ndiscussion which will be undertaken later\u2014namely, to the effect that the\npsychic process which we have recognised as dream displacement proves to\nbe not a process morbidly disturbed, but a process differing from the\nnormal merely in being of a more primitive nature.\nWe thus find in the fact that the dream content takes up remnants of\ntrivial experiences a manifestation of dream disfigurement (by means of\ndisplacement), and we may recall that we have recognised this dream\ndisfigurement as the work of a censor which controls the passage between\ntwo psychic instances. We accordingly expect that dream analysis will\nregularly reveal to us the genuine, significant source of the dream in\nthe life of the day, the recollection of which has transferred its\naccent to some indifferent recollection. This conception brings us into\ncomplete opposition to Robert\u2019s[55] theory, which thus becomes valueless\nfor us. The fact which Robert was trying to explain simply doesn\u2019t\nexist; its assumption is based upon a misunderstanding, upon the failure\nto substitute the real meaning of the dream for its apparent content.\nFurther objection may be made to Robert\u2019s doctrine: If it were really\nthe duty of the dream, by means of a special psychic activity, to rid\nour memory of the \u201cslag\u201d of the recollections of the day, our sleep\nwould have to be more troubled and employed in a more strained effort\nthan we may suppose it to be from our waking life. For the number of\nindifferent impressions received during the day, against which we should\nhave to protect our memory, is obviously infinitely large; the night\nwould not be long enough to accomplish the task. It is very much more\nprobable that the forgetting of indifferent impressions takes place\nwithout any active interference on the part of our psychic powers.\nStill something cautions us against taking leave of Robert\u2019s idea\nwithout further consideration. We have left unexplained the fact that\none of the indifferent day-impressions\u2014one from the previous day\nindeed\u2014regularly furnished a contribution to the dream-content.\nRelations between this impression and the real source of the dream do\nnot always exist from the beginning; as we have seen, they are\nestablished only subsequently, in the course of the dream-work, as\nthough in order to serve the purpose of the intended displacement. There\nmust, therefore, be some necessity to form connections in this\nparticular direction, of the recent, although indifferent impression;\nthe latter must have special fitness for this purpose because of some\nproperty. Otherwise it would be just as easy for the dream thoughts to\ntransfer their accent to some inessential member of their own series of\nassociations.\nThe following experiences will lead us to an explanation. If a day has\nbrought two or more experiences which are fitted to stimulate a dream,\nthen the dream fuses the mention of both into a single whole; it obeys\nan _impulse to fashion a whole out of them_; for instance: One summer\nafternoon I entered a railroad compartment, in which I met two friends\nwho were unknown to each other. One of them was an influential\ncolleague, the other a member of a distinguished family, whose physician\nI was; I made the two gentlemen acquainted with each other; but during\nthe long ride I was the go-between in the conversation, so that I had to\ntreat a subject of conversation now with the one, now with the other. I\nasked my colleague to recommend a common friend who had just begun his\nmedical practice. He answered that he was convinced of the young man\u2019s\nthoroughness, but that his plain appearance would make his entrance into\nhouseholds of rank difficult. I answered: \u201cThat is just why he needs\nrecommendation.\u201d Soon afterwards I asked the other fellow-traveller\nabout the health of his aunt\u2014the mother of one of my patients\u2014who was at\nthe time prostrated by a serious illness. During the night after this\njourney I dreamt that the young friend, for whom I had asked assistance,\nwas in a splendid salon, and was making a funeral oration to a select\ncompany with the air of a man of the world\u2014the oration being upon the\nold lady (now dead for the purposes of the dream) who was the aunt of\nthe second fellow-traveller. (I confess frankly that I had not been on\ngood terms with this lady.) My dream had thus found connections between\nthe two impressions of the day, and by means of them composed a unified\nsituation.\nIn view of many similar experiences, I am driven to conclude that a kind\nof compulsion exists for the dream function, forcing it to bring\ntogether in the dream all the available sources of dream stimulation\ninto a unified whole.[AT] In a subsequent chapter (on the dream\nfunction) we shall become acquainted with this impulse for putting\ntogether as a part of condensation another primary psychic process.\nI shall now discuss the question whether the source from which the dream\noriginates, and to which our analysis leads, must always be a recent\n(and significant) event, or whether a subjective experience, that is to\nsay, the recollection of a psychologically valuable experience\u2014a chain\nof thought\u2014can take the part of a dream stimulus. The answer, which\nresults most unequivocally from numerous analyses, is to the following\neffect. The stimulus for the dream may be a subjective occurrence, which\nhas been made recent, as it were, by the mental activity during the day.\nIt will probably not be out of place here to give a synopsis of various\nconditions which may be recognised as sources of dreams.\nThe source of a dream may be:\n(_a_) A recent and psychologically significant experience which is\ndirectly represented in the dream.[AU]\n(_b_) Several recent, significant experiences, which are united by the\ndream into a whole.[AV]\n(_c_) One or more recent and significant experiences, which are\nrepresented in the dream by the mention of a contemporary but\nindifferent experience.[AW]\n(_d_) A subjective significant experience (a recollection, train of\nthought), which is _regularly_ represented in the dream by the mention\nof a recent but indifferent impression.[AX]\nAs may be seen, in dream interpretation the condition is firmly adhered\nto throughout that each component of the dream repeats a recent\nimpression of the day. The element which is destined to representation\nin the dream may either belong to the presentations surrounding the\nactual dream stimulus itself\u2014and, furthermore, either as an essential or\nan inessential element of the same\u2014or it may originate in the\nneighbourhood of an indifferent impression, which, through associations\nmore or less rich, has been brought into relation with the thoughts\nsurrounding the dream stimulus. The apparent multiplicity of the\nconditions here is produced by _the alternative according to whether\ndisplacement has or has not taken place_, and we may note that this\nalternative serves to explain the contrasts of the dream just as readily\nas the ascending series from partially awake to fully awake brain cells\nin the medical theory of the dream (_cf._ p. 64).\nConcerning this series, it is further notable that the element which is\npsychologically valuable, but not recent (a train of thought, a\nrecollection) may be replaced, for the purposes of dream formation, by a\nrecent, but psychologically indifferent, element, if only these two\nconditions be observed: 1. That the dream shall contain a reference to\nsomething which has been recently experienced; 2. That the dream\nstimulus shall remain a psychologically valuable train of thought. In a\nsingle case (_a_) both conditions are fulfilled by the same impression.\nIf it be added that the same indifferent impressions which are used for\nthe dream, as long as they are recent, lose this availability as soon as\nthey become a day (or at most several days) older, the assumption must\nbe made that the very freshness of an impression gives it a certain\npsychological value for dream formation, which is somewhat equivalent to\nthe value of emotionally accentuated memories or trains of thought. We\nshall be able to see the basis of this value of _recent_ impressions for\ndream formation only with the help of certain psychological\nconsiderations which will appear later.[AY]\nIncidentally our attention is called to the fact that important changes\nin the material comprised by our ideas and our memory may be brought\nabout unconsciously and at night. The injunction that one should sleep\nfor a night upon any affair before making a final decision about it is\nobviously fully justified. But we see that at this point we have\nproceeded from the psychology of dreaming to that of sleep, a step for\nwhich there will often be occasion.\nNow there arises an objection threatening to invalidate the conclusions\nwe have just reached. If indifferent impressions can get into the dream\nonly in case they are recent, how does it happen that we find also in\nthe dream content elements from earlier periods in our lives, which at\nthe time when they were recent possessed, as Str\u00fcmpell expresses it, no\npsychic value, which, therefore, ought to have been forgotten long ago,\nand which, therefore, are neither fresh nor psychologically significant?\nThis objection can be fully met if we rely upon the results furnished by\npsychoanalysis of neurotics. The solution is as follows: The process of\ndisplacement which substitutes indifferent material for that having\npsychic significance (for dreaming as well as for thinking) has already\ntaken place in those earlier periods of life, and has since become fixed\nin the memory. Those elements which were originally indifferent are in\nfact no longer so, since they have acquired the value of psychologically\nsignificant material. That which has actually remained indifferent can\nnever be reproduced in the dream.\nIt will be correct to suppose from the foregoing discussion that I\nmaintain that there are no indifferent dream stimuli, and that,\naccordingly, there are no harmless dreams. This I believe to be the\ncase, thoroughly and exclusively, allowance being made for the dreams of\nchildren and perhaps for short dream reactions to nocturnal sensations.\nWhatever one may dream, it is either manifestly recognisable as\npsychically significant or it is disfigured, and can be judged correctly\nonly after a complete interpretation, when, as before, it may be\nrecognised as possessing psychic significance. The dream never concerns\nitself with trifles; we do not allow ourselves to be disturbed in our\nsleep by matters of slight importance. Dreams which are apparently\nharmless turn out to be sinister if one takes pains to interpret them;\nif I may be permitted the expression, they all have \u201cthe mark of the\nbeast.\u201d As this is another point on which I may expect opposition, and\nas I am glad of an opportunity to show dream-disfigurement at work, I\nshall here subject a number of dreams from my collection to analysis.\n1. An intelligent and refined young lady, who, however, in conduct,\nbelongs to the class we call reserved, to the \u201cstill waters,\u201d relates\nthe following dream:\u2014\n_Her husband asks: \u201cShould not the piano be tuned?\u201d She answers: \u201cIt\nwon\u2019t pay; the hammers would have to be newly buffed too.\u201d_ This repeats\nan actual event of the previous day. Her husband had asked such a\nquestion, and she had answered something similar. But what is the\nsignificance of her dreaming it? She tells of the piano, indeed, that it\nis a _disgusting old box_ which has a bad tone; it is one of the things\nwhich her husband had before they were married,[AZ] &c., but the key to\nthe true solution lies in the phrase: _It won\u2019t pay._ This originated in\na visit made the day before to a lady friend. Here she was asked to take\noff her coat, but she declined, saying, \u201c_It won\u2019t pay._ I must go in a\nmoment.\u201d At this point, I recall that during yesterday\u2019s analysis she\nsuddenly took hold of her coat, a button of which had opened. It is,\ntherefore, as if she had said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t look in this direction; it\nwon\u2019t pay.\u201d Thus \u201c_box_\u201d develops into \u201c_chest_,\u201d or breast-box\n(\u201cbust\u201d), and the interpretation of the dream leads directly to a time\nin her bodily development when she was dissatisfied with her shape. It\nalso leads to earlier periods, if we take into consideration\n\u201c_disgusting_\u201d and \u201c_bad tone_,\u201d and remember how often in allusions and\nin dreams the two small hemispheres of the feminine body take the\nplace\u2014as a substitute and as an antithesis\u2014of the large ones.\nII. I may interrupt this dream to insert a brief harmless dream of a\nyoung man. He dreamt that _he was putting on his winter overcoat again,\nwhich was terrible_. The occasion for this dream is apparently the cold\nweather, which has recently set in again. On more careful examination we\nnote that the two short portions of the dream do not fit together well,\nfor what is there \u201cterrible\u201d about wearing a heavy or thick coat in the\ncold? Unfortunately for the harmlessness of this dream, the first idea\neduced in analysis is the recollection that on the previous day a lady\nhad secretly admitted to him that her last child owed its existence to\nthe bursting of a condom. He now reconstructs his thoughts in accordance\nwith this suggestion: A thin condom is dangerous, a thick one is bad.\nThe condom is an \u201covercoat\u201d (_\u00dcberzieher_), for it is put over\nsomething; _Ueberzieher_ is also the name given in German to a thin\novercoat. An experience like the one related by the lady would indeed be\n\u201cterrible\u201d for an unmarried man.\u2014We may now return to our other harmless\ndreamer.\nIII. _She puts a candle into a candlestick; but the candle is broken, so\nthat it does not stand straight. The girls at school say she is clumsy;\nthe young lady replies that it is not her fault._\nHere, too, there is an actual occasion for the dream; the day before she\nhad actually put a candle into a candlestick; but this one was not\nbroken. A transparent symbolism has been employed here. The candle is an\nobject which excites the feminine genitals; its being broken, so that it\ndoes not stand straight, signifies impotence on the man\u2019s part (\u201cit is\nnot her fault\u201d). But does this young woman, carefully brought up, and a\nstranger to all obscenity, know of this application of the candle? She\nhappens to be able to tell how she came by this information. While\nriding in a boat on the Rhine, another boat passes containing students\nwho are singing or rather yelling, with great delight: \u201cWhen the Queen\nof Sweden with closed shutters and the candles of Apollo....\u201d\nShe does not hear or understand the last word. Her husband is asked to\ngive her the required explanation. These verses are then replaced in the\ndream content by the harmless recollection of a command which she once\nexecuted clumsily at a girls\u2019 boarding school, this occurring by means\nof the common features _closed shutters_. The connection between the\ntheme of onanism and that of impotence is clear enough. \u201cApollo\u201d in the\nlatent dream content connects this dream with an earlier one in which\nthe virgin Pallas figured. All this is obviously not harmless.\nIV. Lest it may seem too easy a matter to draw conclusions from dreams\nconcerning the dreamer\u2019s real circumstances, I add another dream coming\nfrom the same person which likewise appears harmless. \u201c_I dreamt of\ndoing something_,\u201d she relates, \u201c_which I actually did during the day,\nthat is to say, I filled a little trunk so full of hooks that I had\ndifficulty in closing it. My dream was just like the actual\noccurrence._\u201d Here the person relating the dream herself attaches chief\nimportance to the correspondence between the dream and reality. All such\ncriticisms upon the dream and remarks about it, although they have\nsecured a place in waking thought, regularly belong to the latent dream\ncontent, as later examples will further demonstrate. We are told, then,\nthat what the dream relates has actually taken place during the day. It\nwould take us too far afield to tell how we reach the idea of using the\nEnglish language to help us in the interpretation of this dream. Suffice\nit to say that it is again a question of a little box (_cf._ p. 130, the\ndream of the dead child in the box) which has been filled so full that\nnothing more can go into it. Nothing in the least sinister this time.\nIn all these \u201charmless\u201d dreams the sexual factor as a motive for the\nexercise of the censor receives striking prominence. But this is a\nmatter of primary importance, which we must postpone.\n(_b_) _Infantile Experiences as the Source of Dreams_\nAs the third of the peculiarities of the dream content, we have cited\nfrom all the authors (except Robert) the fact that impressions from the\nearliest times of our lives, which seem not to be at the disposal of the\nwaking memory, may appear in the dream. It is, of course, difficult to\njudge how often or how seldom this occurs, because the respective\nelements of the dream are not recognised according to their origin after\nwaking. The proof that we are dealing with childhood impressions must\nthus be reached objectively, and the conditions necessary for this\nhappen to coincide only in rare instances. The story is told by A.\nMaury,[48] as being particularly conclusive, of a man who decided to\nvisit his birthplace after twenty years\u2019 absence. During the night\nbefore his departure, he dreams that he is in an altogether strange\ndistrict, and that he there meets a strange man with whom he has a\nconversation. Having afterward returned to his home, he was able to\nconvince himself that this strange district really existed in the\nneighbourhood of his home town, and the strange man in the dream turned\nout to be a friend of his dead father who lived there. Doubtless, a\nconclusive proof that he had seen both the man and the district in his\nchildhood. The dream, moreover, is to be interpreted as a dream of\nimpatience, like that of the girl who carries her ticket for the concert\nof the evening in her pocket (p. 110), of the child whose father had\npromised him an excursion to the Hameau, and the like. The motives\nexplaining why just this impression of childhood is reproduced for the\ndreamer cannot, of course, be discovered without an analysis.\nOne of the attendants at my lectures, who boasted that his dreams were\nvery rarely subject to disfigurement, told me that he had sometime\nbefore in a dream seen _his former tutor in bed with his nurse_, who had\nbeen in the household until he was eleven years old. The location of\nthis scene does not occur to him in the dream. As he was much\ninterested, he told the dream to his elder brother, who laughingly\nconfirmed its reality. The brother said he remembered the affair very\nwell, for he was at the time six years old. The lovers were in the habit\nof making him, the elder boy, drunk with beer, whenever circumstances\nwere favourable for nocturnal relations. The smaller child, at that time\nthree years old\u2014our dreamer\u2014who slept in the same room as the nurse, was\nnot considered an obstacle.\nIn still another case it may be definitely ascertained, without the aid\nof dream interpretation, that the dream contains elements from\nchildhood; that is, if it be a so-called _perennial_ dream, which being\nfirst dreamt in childhood, later appears again and again after adult age\nhas been reached. I may add a few examples of this sort to those already\nfamiliar, although I have never made the acquaintance of such a\nperennial dream in my own case. A physician in the thirties tells me\nthat a yellow lion, about which he can give the most detailed\ninformation, has often appeared in his dream-life from the earliest\nperiod of his childhood to the present day. This lion, known to him from\nhis dreams, was one day discovered _in natura_ as a long-forgotten\nobject made of porcelain, and on that occasion the young man learned\nfrom his mother that this object had been his favourite toy in early\nchildhood, a fact which he himself could no longer remember.\nIf we now turn from the manifest dream content to the dream thoughts\nwhich are revealed only upon analysis, the co-operation of childhood\nexperiences may be found to exist even in dreams whose content would not\nhave led us to suspect anything of the sort. I owe a particularly\ndelightful and instructive example of such a dream to my honoured\ncolleague of the \u201cyellow lion.\u201d After reading Nansen\u2019s account of his\npolar expedition, he dreamt that he was giving the bold explorer\nelectrical treatment in an ice field for an isch\u00e6mia of which the latter\ncomplained! In the analysis of this dream, he remembered a story of his\nchildhood, without which the dream remains entirely unintelligible. When\nhe was a child, three or four years old, he was listening attentively to\na conversation of older people about trips of exploration, and presently\nasked papa whether exploration was a severe illness. He had apparently\nconfused \u201ctrips\u201d with \u201crips,\u201d and the ridicule of his brothers and\nsisters prevented his ever forgetting the humiliating experience.\nThe case is quite similar when, in the analysis of the dream of the\nmonograph on the genus cyclamen, I happen upon the recollection,\nretained from childhood, that my father allowed me to destroy a book\nembellished with coloured plates when I was a little boy five years old.\nIt will perhaps be doubted whether this recollection actually took part\nin the composition of the dream content, and it will be intimated that\nthe process of analysis has subsequently established the connection. But\nthe abundance and intricacy of the ties of association vouch for the\ntruth of my explanation: cyclamen\u2014favourite flower\u2014favourite\ndish\u2014artichoke; to pick to pieces like an artichoke, leaf by leaf (a\nphrase which at that time rang in our ears \u00e0 propos of the dividing up\nof the Chinese Empire)\u2014herbarium-bookworm, whose favourite dish is\nbooks. I may state further that the final meaning of the dream, which I\nhave not given here, has the most intimate connection with the content\nof the childhood scene.\nIn another series of dreams we learn from analysis that the wish itself,\nwhich has given rise to the dream, and whose fulfilment the dream turns\nout to be, has originated in childhood\u2014until one is astonished to find\nthat the child with all its impulses lives on in the dream.\nI shall now continue the interpretation of a dream which has already\nproved instructive\u2014I refer to the dream in which friend R. is my uncle\n(p. 116). We have carried its interpretation far enough for the\nwish-motive, of being appointed professor, to assert itself tangibly;\nand we have explained the affection displayed in the dream for friend R.\nas a fiction of opposition and spite against the aspersion of the two\ncolleagues, who appear in the dream thoughts. The dream was my own; I\nmay, therefore, continue the analysis by stating that my feelings were\nnot quite satisfied by the solution reached. I know that my opinion of\nthese colleagues who are so badly treated in the dream thoughts would\nhave been expressed in quite different terms in waking life; the potency\nof the wish not to share their fate in the matter of appointment seemed\nto me too slight to account for the discrepancy between my estimate in\nthe dream and that of waking. If my desire to be addressed by a new\ntitle proves so strong it gives proof of a morbid ambition, which I did\nnot know to exist in me, and which I believe is far from my thoughts. I\ndo not know how others, who think they know me, would judge me, for\nperhaps I have really been ambitious; but if this be true, my ambition\nhas long since transferred itself to other objects than the title and\nrank of assistant-professor.\nWhence, then, the ambition which the dream has ascribed to me? Here I\nremember a story which I heard often in my childhood, that at my birth\nan old peasant\u2019s wife had prophesied to my happy mother (I was her\nfirst-born) that she had given to the world a great man. Such prophecies\nmust occur very frequently; there are so many mothers happy in\nexpectation, and so many old peasant wives whose influence on earth has\nwaned, and who have therefore turned their eyes towards the future. The\nprophetess was not likely to suffer for it either. Might my hunger for\ngreatness have originated from this source? But here I recollect an\nimpression from the later years of my childhood, which would serve still\nbetter as an explanation. It was of an evening at an inn on the\nPrater,[BA] where my parents were accustomed to take me when I was\neleven or twelve years old. We noticed a man who went from table to\ntable and improvised verses upon any subject that was given to him. I\nwas sent to bring the poet to our table and he showed himself thankful\nfor the message. Before asking for his subject he threw off a few rhymes\nabout me, and declared it probable, if he could trust his inspiration,\nthat I would one day become a \u201cminister.\u201d I can still distinctly\nremember the impression made by this second prophecy. It was at the time\nof the election for the municipal ministry; my father had recently\nbrought home pictures of those elected to the ministry\u2014Herbst, Giskra,\nUnger, Berger, and others\u2014and we had illuminated them in honour of these\ngentlemen. There were even some Jews among them; every industrious\nJewish schoolboy therefore had the making of a minister in him. Even the\nfact that until shortly before my enrolment in the University I wanted\nto study jurisprudence, and changed my plans only at the last moment,\nmust be connected with the impressions of that time. A minister\u2019s career\nis under no circumstances open to a medical man. And now for my dream! I\nbegin to see that it transplants me from the sombre present to the\nhopeful time of the municipal election, and fulfils my wish of that time\nto the fullest extent. In treating my two estimable and learned\ncolleagues so badly, because they are Jews, the one as a simpleton and\nthe other as a criminal\u2014in doing this I act as though I were the\nminister of education, I put myself in his place. What thorough revenge\nI take upon his Excellency! He refuses to appoint me professor\nextraordinarius, and in return I put myself in his place in the dream.\nAnother case establishes the fact that although the wish which actuates\nthe dream is a present one, it nevertheless draws great intensification\nfrom childhood memories. I refer to a series of dreams which are based\nupon the longing to go to Rome. I suppose I shall still have to satisfy\nthis longing by means of dreams for a long time to come, because, at the\ntime of year which is at my disposal for travelling, a stay at Rome is\nto be avoided on account of considerations of health.[BB] Thus I once\ndreamt of seeing the Tiber and the bridge of St. Angelo from the window\nof a railroad compartment; then the train starts, and it occurs to me\nthat I have never entered the city at all. The view which I saw in the\ndream was modelled after an engraving which I had noticed in passing the\nday before in the parlour of one of my patients. On another occasion\nsome one is leading me upon a hill and showing me Rome half enveloped in\nmist, and so far in the distance that I am astonished at the\ndistinctness of the view. The content of this dream is too rich to be\nfully reported here. The motive, \u201cto see the promised land from afar,\u201d\nis easily recognisable in it. The city is L\u00fcbeck, which I first saw in\nthe mist; the original of the hill is the Gleichenberg. In a third\ndream, I am at last in Rome, as the dream tells me. To my\ndisappointment, the scenery which I see is anything but urban. _A little\nriver with black water, on one side of which are black rocks, on the\nother large white flowers. I notice a certain Mr. Zucker_ (with whom I\nam superficially acquainted), _and make up my mind to ask him to show me\nthe way into the city._ It is apparent that I am trying in vain to see a\ncity in the dream which I have never seen in waking life. If I resolve\nthe landscape into its elements, the white flowers indicate Ravenna,\nwhich is known to me, and which, for a time at least, deprived Rome of\nits leading place as capital of Italy. In the swamps around Ravenna we\nhad seen the most beautiful water-lilies in the middle of black pools of\nwater; the dream makes them grow on meadows, like the narcissi of our\nown Aussee, because at Ravenna it was such tedious work to fetch them\nout of the water. The black rock, so close to the water, vividly recalls\nthe valley of the Tepl at Karlsbad. \u201cKarlsbad\u201d now enables me to account\nfor the peculiar circumstance that I ask Mr. Zucker the way. In the\nmaterial of which the dream is composed appear also two of those amusing\nJewish anecdotes, which conceal so much profound and often bitter\nworldly wisdom, and which we are so fond of quoting in our conversation\nand letters. One is the story of the \u201cconstitution,\u201d and tells how a\npoor Jew sneaks into the express train for Karlsbad without a ticket,\nhow he is caught and is treated more and more unkindly at each call for\ntickets by the conductor, and how he tells a friend, whom he meets at\none of the stations during his miserable journey, and who asks him where\nhe is travelling: \u201cTo Karlsbad, if my constitution will stand it.\u201d\nAssociated with this in memory is another story about a Jew who is\nignorant of French, and who has express instructions to ask in Paris for\nthe way to the Rue Richelieu. Paris was for many years the object of my\nown longing, and I took the great satisfaction with which I first set\nfoot on the pavement in Paris as a warrant that I should also attain the\nfulfilment of other wishes. Asking for the way is again a direct\nallusion to Rome, for of course all roads lead to Rome. Moreover, the\nname Zucker (English, sugar) again points to _Karlsbad_, whither we send\nall persons afflicted with the _constitutional_ disease, diabetes\n(_Zuckerkrankheit_, sugar-disease). The occasion for this dream was the\nproposal of my Berlin friend that we should meet in Prague at Easter. A\nfurther allusion to sugar and diabetes was to be found in the matters\nwhich I had to talk over with him.\nA fourth dream, occurring shortly after the last one mentioned, brings\nme back to Rome. I see a street-corner before me and am astonished to\nsee so many German placards posted there. On the day before I had\nwritten my friend with prophetic vision that Prague would probably not\nbe a comfortable resort for German travellers. The dream, therefore,\nsimultaneously expressed the wish to meet him at Rome instead of at the\nBohemian city, and a desire, which probably originated during my student\ndays, that the German language might be accorded more tolerance in\nPrague. Besides I must have understood the Czech language in the first\nthree years of my childhood, because I was born in a small village of\nMoravia, inhabited by Slavs. A Czech nursery rhyme, which I heard in my\nseventeenth year, became, without effort on my part, so imprinted upon\nmy memory that I can repeat it to this day, although I have no idea of\nits meaning. There is then no lack in these dreams also of manifold\nrelations to impressions from the first years of my life.\nIt was during my last journey to Italy, which, among other places, took\nme past Lake Trasimenus, that I at last found what re-enforcement my\nlonging for the Eternal City had received from the impressions of my\nyouth; this was after I had seen the Tiber, and had turned back with\npainful emotions when I was within eighty kilometers of Rome. I was just\nbroaching the plan of travelling to Naples via Rome the next year, when\nthis sentence, which I must have read in one of our classical authors,\noccurred to me: \u201cIt is a question which of the two paced up and down in\nhis room the more impatiently after he had made the plan to go to\nRome\u2014Assistant-Headmaster Winckelman or the great general Hannibal.\u201d I\nmyself had walked in Hannibal\u2019s footsteps; like him I was destined never\nto see Rome, and he too had gone to Campania after the whole world had\nexpected him in Rome. Hannibal, with whom I had reached this point of\nsimilarity, had been my favourite hero during my years at the Gymnasium;\nlike so many boys of my age, I bestowed my sympathies during the Punic\nwar, not on the Romans, but on the Carthaginians. Then, when I came\nfinally to understand the consequences of belonging to an alien race,\nand was forced by the anti-semitic sentiment among my class-mates to\nassume a definite attitude, the figure of the semitic commander assumed\nstill greater proportions in my eyes. Hannibal and Rome symbolised for\nme as a youth the antithesis between the tenaciousness of the Jews and\nthe organisation of the Catholic Church. The significance for our\nemotional life which the anti-semitic movement has since assumed helped\nto fix the thoughts and impressions of that earlier time. Thus the wish\nto get to Rome has become the cover and symbol in my dream-life for\nseveral warmly cherished wishes, for the realisation of which one might\nwork with the perseverance and single-mindedness of the Punic general,\nand whose fulfilment sometimes seems as little favoured by fortune as\nthe wish of Hannibal\u2019s life to enter Rome.\nAnd now for the first time I happen upon the youthful experience which,\neven to-day, still manifests its power in all these emotions and dreams.\nI may have been ten or twelve years old when my father began to take me\nwith him on his walks, and to reveal to me his views about the things of\nthis world in his conversation. In this way he once told me, in order to\nshow into how much better times I had been born than he, the following:\n\u201cWhile I was a young man, I was walking one Saturday on a street in the\nvillage where you were born; I was handsomely dressed and wore a new fur\ncap. Along comes a Christian, who knocks my cap into the mud with one\nblow and shouts: \u201cJew, get off the sidewalk.\u201d \u201cAnd what did you do?\u201d \u201cI\nwent into the street and picked up the cap,\u201d was the calm answer. That\ndid not seem heroic on the part of the big strong man, who was leading\nme, a little fellow, by the hand. I contrasted this situation, which did\nnot please me, with another more in harmony with my feelings\u2014the scene\nin which Hannibal\u2019s father, Hamilcar[BC] Barka made his boy swear at the\ndomestic altar to take vengeance on the Romans. Since that time Hannibal\nhas had a place in my phantasies.\u201d\nI think I can follow my enthusiasm for the Carthaginian general still\nfurther back into my childhood, so that possibly we have here the\ntransference of an already formed emotional relation to a new vehicle.\nOne of the first books which fell into my childish hands, after I\nlearned to read, was Thiers\u2019 _Konsulat und Kaiserreich_ (Consulship and\nEmpire); I remember I pasted on the flat backs of my wooden soldiers\nlittle labels with the names of the Imperial marshals, and that at that\ntime Mass\u00e9na (as a Jew Menasse) was already my avowed favourite.\nNapoleon himself follows Hannibal in crossing the Alps. And perhaps the\ndevelopment of this martial ideal can be traced still further back into\nmy childhood, to the wish which the now friendly, now hostile,\nintercourse during my first three years with a boy a year older than\nmyself must have actuated in the weaker of the two playmates.\nThe deeper one goes in the analysis of dreams, the more often one is put\non the track of childish experiences which play the part of dream\nsources in the latent dream content.\nWe have learned (p. 16) that the dream very rarely reproduces\nexperiences in such a manner that they constitute the sole manifest\ndream content, unabridged and unchanged. Still some authentic examples\nshowing this process have been reported, and I can add some new ones\nwhich again refer to infantile scenes. In the case of one of my\npatients, a dream once gave a barely disfigured reproduction of a sexual\noccurrence, which was immediately recognised as an accurate\nrecollection. The memory of it indeed had never been lost in waking\nlife, but it had been greatly obscured, and its revivification was a\nresult of the preceding work of analysis. The dreamer had at the age of\ntwelve visited a bed-ridden schoolmate, who had exposed himself by a\nmovement in bed, probably only by chance. At the sight of the genitals,\nhe was seized by a kind of compulsion, exposed himself and took hold of\nthe member belonging to the other boy, who, however, looked at him with\nsurprise and indignation, whereupon he became embarrassed and let go. A\ndream repeated this scene twenty-three years later, with all the details\nof the emotions occurring in it, changing it, however, in this respect,\nthat the dreamer took the passive part instead of the active one, while\nthe person of the schoolmate was replaced by one belonging to the\npresent.\nAs a rule, of course, a childhood scene is represented in the manifest\ndream content only by an allusion, and must be extricated from the dream\nby means of interpretation. The citation of examples of this kind cannot\nhave a very convincing effect, because every guarantee that they are\nexperiences of childhood is lacking; if they belong to an earlier time\nof life, they are no longer recognised by our memory. Justification for\nthe conclusion that such childish experiences generally exist in dreams\nis based upon a great number of factors which become apparent in\npsychoanalytical work, and which seem reliable enough when regarded as a\nwhole. But when, for the purposes of dream interpretation, such\nreferences of dreams to childish experiences are torn from their\ncontext, they will perhaps not make much impression, especially since I\nnever give all the material upon which the interpretation depends.\nHowever, I shall not let this prevent me from giving some examples.\nI. The following dream is from another female patient: _She is in a\nlarge room, in which there are all kinds of machines, perhaps, as she\nimagines, an orthop\u00e6dic institute. She hears that I have no time, and\nthat she must take the treatment along with five others. But she\nresists, and is unwilling to lie down on the bed\u2014or whatever it is\u2014which\nis intended for her. She stands in a corner and waits for me to say \u201cIt\nis not true.\u201d The others, meanwhile, laugh at her, saying it is all\nfoolishness on her part. At the same time it is as if she were called\nupon to make many small squares._\nThe first part of the content of this dream is an allusion to the\ntreatment and a transference on me. The second contains an allusion to a\nchildhood scene; the two portions are connected by the mention of the\nbed. The orthop\u00e6dic institute refers to one of my talks in which I\ncompared the treatment as to its duration and nature with an orthop\u00e6dic\ntreatment. At the beginning of the treatment I had to tell her that _for\nthe present_ I had little time for her, but that later on I would devote\na whole hour to her daily. This aroused in her the old sensitiveness,\nwhich is the chief characteristic of children who are to be hysterical.\nTheir desire for love is insatiable. My patient was the youngest of six\nbrothers and sisters (hence, \u201c_with five others_\u201d), and as such the\nfavourite of her father, but in spite of that she seems to have found\nthat her beloved father devoted too little time and attention to her.\nThe detail of her waiting for me to say \u201cIt is not true,\u201d has the\nfollowing explanation: A tailor\u2019s apprentice had brought her a dress,\nand she had given him the money for it. Then she asked her husband\nwhether she would have to pay the money again if the boy were to lose\nit. To tease her, her husband answered \u201cYes\u201d (the teasing in the dream),\nand she asked again and again, and _waited for him to say_ \u201c_It is not\ntrue._\u201d The thought of the latent dream-content may now be construed as\nfollows: Will she have to pay me the double amount if I devote twice the\ntime to her? a thought which is stingy or filthy. (The uncleanliness of\nchildhood is often replaced in the dream by greediness for money; the\nword filthy here supplies the bridge.) If all that about waiting until I\nshould say, &c., serves as a dream circumlocution for the word \u201cfilthy,\u201d\nthe standing-in-a-corner and not lying down-on-the-bed are in keeping;\nfor these two features are component parts of a scene of childhood, in\nwhich she had soiled her bed, and for punishment was put into a corner,\nwith the warning that papa would not love her any more, and her brothers\nand sisters laughed at her, &c. The little squares refer to her young\nniece, who has shown her the arithmetical trick of writing figures in\nnine squares, I believe it is, in such a way that upon being added\ntogether in any direction they make fifteen.\nII. Here is the dream of a man: _He sees two boys tussling with each\nother, and they are cooper\u2019s boys, as he concludes from the implements\nwhich are lying about; one of the boys has thrown the other down, the\nprostrate one wears ear-rings with blue stones. He hurries after the\nwrongdoer with lifted cane, in order to chastise him. The latter takes\nrefuge with a woman who is standing against a wooden fence, as though it\nwere his mother. She is the wife of a day labourer, and she turns her\nback to the man who is dreaming. At last she faces about and stares at\nhim with a horrible look, so that he runs away in fright; in her eyes\nthe red flesh of the lower lid seems to stand out._\nThe dream has made abundant use of trivial occurrences of the previous\nday. The day before he actually saw two boys on the street, one of whom\nthrew the other one down. When he hurried up to them in order to settle\nthe quarrel, both of them took flight. Coopers\u2019 boys: this is explained\nonly by a subsequent dream, in the analysis of which he used the\nexpression, \u201c_To knock the bottom out of the barrel._\u201d Ear-rings with\nblue stones, according to his observation, are chiefly worn by\nprostitutes. Furthermore, a familiar doggerel rhyme about two boys comes\nup: \u201cThe other boy, his name was Mary\u201d (that is, he was a girl). The\nwoman standing up: after the scene with the two boys, he took a walk on\nthe bank of the Danube, and took advantage of being alone to urinate\n_against a wooden fence_. A little later during his walk, a decently\ndressed elderly lady smiled at him very pleasantly, and wanted to hand\nhim her card with her address.\nSince in the dream the woman stood as he had while urinating, it is a\nquestion of a woman urinating, and this explains the \u201chorrible look,\u201d\nand the prominence of the red flesh, which can only refer to the\ngenitals which gap in squatting. He had seen genitals in his childhood,\nand they had appeared in later recollection as \u201cproud flesh\u201d and as\n\u201cwound.\u201d The dream unites two occasions upon which, as a young boy, the\ndreamer had had opportunity to see the genitals of little girls, in\nthrowing one down, and while another was urinating; and, as is shown by\nanother association, he had kept in memory a punishment or threat of his\nfather\u2019s, called forth by the sexual curiosity which the boy manifested\non these occasions.\nIII. A great mass of childish memories, which have been hastily united\nin a phantasy, is to be found behind the following dream of a young\nlady.\n_She goes out in trepidation, in order to do some shopping. On the\nGraben[BD] she sinks to her knees as though broken down. Many people\ncollect around her, especially the hackney-coach drivers; but no one\nhelps her to get up. She makes many unavailing attempts; finally she\nmust have succeeded, for she is put into a hackney-coach which is to\ntake her home. A large, heavily laden basket (something like a\nmarket-basket) is thrown after her through the window._\nThis is the same woman who is always harassed in her dreams as she was\nharassed when a child. The first situation of the dream is apparently\ntaken from seeing a horse that had fallen, just as \u201cbroken down\u201d points\nto horse-racing. She was a rider in her early years, still earlier she\nwas probably also a horse. Her first childish memory of the\nseventeen-year-old son of the porter, who, being seized on the street by\nan epileptic fit, was brought home in a coach, is connected with the\nidea of falling down. Of this, of course, she has only heard, but the\nidea of epileptic fits and of falling down has obtained great power over\nher phantasies, and has later influenced the form of her own hysterical\nattacks. When a person of the female sex dreams of falling, this almost\nregularly has a sexual significance; she becomes a \u201cfallen woman,\u201d and\nfor the purpose of the dream under consideration this interpretation is\nprobably the least doubtful, for she falls on the Graben, the place in\nVienna which is known as the concourse of prostitutes. The market-basket\nadmits of more than one interpretation; in the sense of refusal (German,\n_Korb_ = basket\u2014snub, refusal), she remembers the many snubs which she\nfirst gave her suitors, and which she later, as she thinks, received\nherself. Here belongs also the detail that _no one will help her up_,\nwhich she herself interprets as being disdained. Furthermore, the\nmarket-basket recalls phantasies that have already appeared in the\ncourse of analysis, in which she imagines she has married far beneath\nher station, and now goes marketing herself. But lastly the\nmarket-basket might be interpreted as the mark of a servant. This\nsuggests further childhood memories\u2014of a cook who was sent away because\nshe stole; she, too, sank to her knees and begged for mercy. The dreamer\nwas at that time twelve years old. Then there is a recollection of a\nchamber-maid, who was dismissed because she had an affair with the\ncoachman of the household, who, incidentally, married her afterwards.\nThis recollection, therefore, gives us a clue to the coachman in the\ndream (who do not, in contrast with what is actually the case, take the\npart of the fallen woman). But there still remains to be explained the\nthrowing of the basket, and the throwing of it through the window. This\ntakes her to the transference of baggage on the railroad, to the\n_Fensterln_,[BE] in the country, and to minor impressions received at a\ncountry resort, of a gentleman throwing some blue plums to a lady\nthrough her window, and of the dreamer\u2019s little sister being frightened\nbecause a cretin who was passing looked in at the window. And now from\nbehind this there emerges an obscure recollection, from her tenth year,\nof a nurse who made love at the country resort with a servant of the\nhousehold, of which the child had opportunity to see something, and who\nwas \u201cfired\u201d (thrown out) (in the dream the opposite: \u201cthrown into\u201d), a\nstory which we had also approached by several other paths. The baggage,\nmoreover, or the trunk of a servant, is disparagingly referred to in\nVienna as \u201cseven plums.\u201d \u201cPack up your seven plums and get out.\u201d\nMy collection, of course, contains an abundant supply of such patients\u2019\ndreams, whose analysis leads to childish impressions that are remembered\nobscurely or not at all, and that often date back to the first three\nyears of life. But it is a mistake to draw conclusions from them which\nare to apply to the dream in general; we are in every case dealing with\nneurotic, particularly with hysterical persons; and the part played by\nchildhood scenes in these dreams might be conditioned by the nature of\nthe neurosis, and not by that of the dream. However, I am struck quite\nas often in the course of interpreting my own dreams, which I do not do\non account of obvious symptoms of disease, by the fact that I\nunsuspectingly come upon a scene of childhood in the latent dream\ncontent, and that a whole series of dreams suddenly falls into line with\nconclusions drawn from childish experiences. I have already given\nexamples of this, and shall give still more upon various occasions.\nPerhaps I cannot close the whole chapter more fittingly than by citing\nseveral of my own dreams, in which recent happenings and long-forgotten\nexperiences of childhood appear together as sources of dreams.\nI. After I have been travelling and have gone to bed hungry and tired,\nthe great necessities of life begin to assert their claims in sleep, and\nI dream as follows: _I go into a kitchen to order some pastry. Here\nthree women are standing, one of whom is the hostess, and is turning\nsomething in her hand as though she were making dumplings. She answers\nthat I must wait until she has finished_ (not distinctly as a speech).\n_I become impatient and go away insulted. I put on an overcoat; but the\nfirst one which I try is too long. I take it off, and am somewhat\nastonished to find that it has fur trimming. A second one has sewn into\nit a long strip of cloth with Turkish drawings. A stranger with a long\nface and a short pointed beard comes up and prevents me from putting it\non, declaring that it belongs to him. I now show him that it is\nembroidered all over in Turkish fashion. He asks, \u201cWhat business are the\nTurkish (drawings, strips of cloth ...) of yours?\u201d But we then become\nquite friendly with each other._\nIn the analysis of this dream there occurs to me quite unexpectedly the\nnovel which I read, that is to say, which I began with the end of the\nfirst volume, when I was perhaps thirteen years old. I have never known\nthe name of the novel or of its author, but the conclusion remains\nvividly in my memory. The hero succumbs to insanity, and continually\ncalls the names of the three women that have signified the greatest good\nand ill fortune for him during life. P\u00e9lagie is one of these names. I\nstill do not know what to make of this name in the analysis. \u00c0 propos of\nthe three women there now come to the surface the three Parc\u00e6 who spin\nthe fate of man, and I know that one of the three women, the hostess in\nthe dream, is the mother who gives life, and who, moreover, as in my\ncase, gives the first nourishment to the living creature. Love and\nhunger meet at the mother\u2019s breast. A young man\u2014so runs an anecdote\u2014who\nbecame a great admirer of womanly beauty, once when the conversation\nturned upon a beautiful wet nurse who had nourished him as a child,\nexpressed himself to the effect that he was sorry that he had not taken\nbetter advantage of his opportunity at the time. I am in the habit of\nusing the anecdote to illustrate the factor of subsequence in the\nmechanism of psychoneuroses.... One of the Parc\u00e6, then, is rubbing the\npalms of her hands together as though she were making dumplings. A\nstrange occupation for one of the Fates, which is urgently in need of an\nexplanation! This is now found in another and earlier childhood memory.\nWhen I was six years old, and was receiving my first instructions from\nmy mother, I was asked to believe that we are made of earth, and that\ntherefore we must return to earth. But this did not suit me, and I\ndoubted her teaching. Thereupon my mother rubbed the palms of her hands\ntogether\u2014just as in making dumplings, except that there was no dough\nbetween them\u2014and showed me the blackish scales of epidermis which were\nthus rubbed off as a proof that it is earth of which we are made. My\nastonishment at this demonstration _ad oculos_ was without limit, and I\nacquiesced in the idea which I was later to hear expressed in words:\n\u201cThou owest nature a death.\u201d[BF] Thus the women are really Parc\u00e6 whom I\nvisit in the kitchen, as I have done so often in my childhood years when\nI was hungry, and when my mother used to order me to wait until lunch\nwas ready. And now for the dumplings! At least one of my teachers at the\nUniversity, the very one to whom I am indebted for my histological\nknowledge (epidermis), might be reminded by the name Knoedl (German,\n_Knoedel_ = dumplings) of a person whom he had to prosecute for\ncommitting a plagiarism of his writings. To commit plagiarism, to\nappropriate anything one can get, even though it belongs to another,\nobviously leads to the second part of the dream, in which I am treated\nlike a certain overcoat thief, who for a time plied his trade in the\nauditoria. I wrote down the expression plagiarism\u2014without any\nreason\u2014because it presented itself to me, and now I perceive that it\nmust belong to the latent dream-content, because it will serve as a\nbridge between different parts of the manifest dream-content. The chain\nof associations\u2014P\u00e9lagie\u2014plagiarism\u2014plagiostomi[BG] (sharks)\u2014fish\nbladder\u2014connects the old novel with the affair of Knoedl and with the\novercoats (German, _\u00dcberzieher_ = thing drawn over\u2014overcoat or condom),\nwhich obviously refer to an object belonging to the technique of sexual\nlife.[BH] This, it is true, is a very forced and irrational connection,\nbut it is nevertheless one which I could not establish in waking life if\nit had not been already established by the activity of the dream.\nIndeed, as though nothing were sacred for this impulse to force\nconnections, the beloved name, Bruecke (bridge of words, see above), now\nserves to remind me of the institution in which I spent my happiest\nhours as a student, quite without any cares (\u201cSo you will ever find more\npleasure at the breasts of knowledge without measure\u201d), in the most\ncomplete contrast to the urgent desires which vex me while I dream. And\nfinally there comes to the surface the recollection of another dear\nteacher, whose name again sounds like something to eat (Fleischl\u2014German,\n_Fleisch_ = meat\u2014like Knoedl), and of a pathetic scene, in which the\nscales of epidermis play a part (mother\u2014hostess), and insanity (the\nnovel), and a remedy from the Latin kitchen which numbs the sensation of\nhunger, to wit, cocaine.\nIn this manner I could follow the intricate trains of thought still\nfurther, and could fully explain the part of the dream which is missing\nin the analysis; but I must refrain, because the personal sacrifices\nwhich it would require are too great. I shall merely take up one of the\nthreads, which will serve to lead us directly to the dream thoughts that\nlie at the bottom of the confusion. The stranger, with the long face and\npointed beard, who wants to prevent me from putting on the overcoat, has\nthe features of a tradesman at Spalato, of whom my wife made ample\npurchases of Turkish cloths. His name was Popovic\u0313, a suspicious name,\nwhich, by the way, has given the humorist Stettenheim a chance to make a\nsignificant remark: \u201cHe told me his name, and blushingly shook my\nhand.\u201d[BI] Moreover, there is the same abuse of names as above with\nP\u00e9lagie, Knoedl, Bruecke, Fleischl. That such playing with names is\nchildish nonsense can be asserted without fear of contradiction; if I\nindulge in it, this indulgence amounts to an act of retribution, for my\nown name has numberless times fallen a victim to such weak-minded\nattempts at humour. Goethe once remarked how sensitive a man is about\nhis name with which, as with his skin, he feels that he has grown up,\nwhereupon Herder composed the following on his name:\n\u201cThou who art born of _gods_, of _Goths_, or of _Kot_ (mud)\u2014\nThy _god_like images, too, are dust.\u201d\nI perceive that this digression about the abuse of names was only\nintended to prepare for this complaint. But let us stop here.... The\npurchase at Spalato reminds me of another one at Cattaro, where I was\ntoo cautious, and missed an opportunity for making some desirable\nacquisitions. (Missing an opportunity at the breast of the nurse, see\nabove.) Another dream thought, occasioned in the dreamer by the\nsensation of hunger, is as follows: _One should let nothing which one\ncan have escape, even if a little wrong is done; no opportunity should\nbe missed, life is so short, death inevitable._ Owing to the fact that\nthis also has a sexual significance, and that desire is unwilling to\nstop at a wrong, this philosophy of _carpe diem_ must fear the censor\nand must hide behind a dream. This now makes articulate counter-thoughts\nof all kinds, recollections of a time when spiritual food alone was\nsufficient for the dreamer; it suggests repressions of every kind, and\neven threats of disgusting sexual punishments.\nII. A second dream requires a longer preliminary statement:\nI have taken a car to the West Station in order to begin a vacation\njourney to the Aussee, and I reach the station in time for the train to\nIschl, which leaves earlier. Here I see Count Thun, who is again going\nto see the Emperor at Ischl. In spite of the rain, he has come in an\nopen carriage, has passed out at once through the door for local trains,\nand has motioned back the gate-keeper, who does not know him and who\nwants to take his ticket, with a little wave of his hand. After the\ntrain to Ischl has left, I am told to leave the platform and go back\ninto the hot waiting-room; but with difficulty I secure permission to\nremain. I pass the time in watching the people who make use of bribes to\nsecure a compartment; I make up my mind to insist on my rights\u2014that is,\nto demand the same privilege. Meanwhile I sing something to myself,\nwhich I afterwards recognise to be the aria from Figaro\u2019s Wedding:\n\u201cIf my lord Count wishes to try a dance,\nTry a dance,\nLet him but say so,\nI\u2019ll play him a tune.\u201d\n(Possibly another person would not have recognised the song.)\nDuring the whole afternoon I have been in an insolent, combative mood;\nI have spoken roughly to the waiter and the cabman, I hope without\nhurting their feelings; now all kinds of bold and revolutionary\nthoughts come into my head, of a kind suited to the words of Figaro\nand the comedy of Beaumarchais, which I had seen at the Com\u00e9die\nFran\u00e7aise. The speech about great men who had taken the trouble to be\nborn; the aristocratic prerogative, which Count Almaviva wants to\napply in the case of Susan; the jokes which our malicious journalists\nof the Opposition make upon the name of Count Thun (German, _thun_ =\ndoing) by calling him Count Do-Nothing. I really do not envy him; he\nhas now a difficult mission with the Emperor, and I am the real Count\nDo-Nothing, for I am taking a vacation. With this, all kinds of\ncheerful plans for the vacation. A gentleman now arrives who is known\nto me as a representative of the Government at the medical\nexaminations, and who has won the flattering nickname of \u201cGovernmental\nbed-fellow\u201d by his activities in this capacity. By insisting on his\nofficial station he secures half of a first-class compartment, and I\nhear one guard say to the other: \u201cWhere are we going to put the\ngentleman with the first-class half-compartment?\u201d A pretty\nfavouritism; I am paying for a whole first-class compartment. Now I\nget a whole compartment for myself, but not in a through coach, so\nthat there is no toilet at my disposal during the night. My complaints\nto the guard are without result; I get even by proposing that at least\nthere be a hole made in the floor of this compartment for the possible\nneeds of the travellers. I really awake at a quarter of three in the\nmorning with a desire to urinate, having had the following dream:\nCrowd of people, meeting of students.... _A certain Count (Thun or\nTaafe) is making a speech. Upon being asked to say something about the\nGermans, he declares with contemptuous mien that their favourite flower\nis Colt\u2019s-foot, and then puts something like a torn leaf, really the\ncrumpled skeleton of a leaf, into his buttonhole. I make a start, I make\na start then,[BJ] but I am surprised at this idea of mine._ Then more\nindistinctly: _It seems as though it were the vestibule (Aula), the\nexits are jammed, as though it were necessary to flee. I make my way\nthrough a suite of handsomely furnished rooms, apparently governmental\nchambers, with furniture of a colour which is between brown and violet,\nand at last I come to a passage where a housekeeper, an elderly, fat\nwoman (Frauenzimmer), is seated. I try to avoid talking to her, but\napparently she thinks I have a right to pass because she asks whether\nshe shall accompany me with the lamp. I signify to her to tell her that\nshe is to remain standing on the stairs, and in this I appear to myself\nvery clever, for avoiding being watched at last. I am downstairs now,\nand I find a narrow, steep way along which I go._\nAgain indistinctly.... _It is as if my second task were to get away out\nof the city, as my earlier was to get out of the house. I am riding in a\none-horse carriage, and tell the driver to take me to a railway station.\n\u201cI cannot ride with you on the tracks,\u201d I say, after he has made the\nobjection that I have tired him out. Here it seems as though I had\nalready driven with him along a course which is ordinarily traversed on\nthe railroad. The stations are crowded; I consider whether I shall go to\nKrems or to Znaim, but I think that the court will be there, and I\ndecide in favour of Graz or something of the sort. Now I am seated in\nthe coach, which is something like a street-car, and I have in my\nbuttonhole a long braided thing, on which are violet-brown violets of\nstiff material, which attracts the attention of many people. Here the\nscene breaks off._\n_I am again in front of the railroad station, but I am with a elderly\ngentleman. I invent a scheme for remaining unrecognised, but I also see\nthis plan already carried out. Thinking and experiencing are here, as it\nwere, the same thing. He pretends to be blind, at least in one eye, and\nI hold a male urinal in front of him (which we have had to buy in the\ncity or did buy), I am thus a sick attendant, and have to give him the\nurinal because he is blind. If the conductor sees us in this position,\nhe must pass us by without drawing attention. At the same time the\nattitude of the person mentioned is visually observed._ Then I awake\nwith a desire to urinate.\nThe whole dream seems a sort of phantasy, which takes the dreamer back\nto the revolutionary year 1848, the memory of which had been renewed by\nthe anniversary year 1898, as well as by a little excursion to Wachau,\nwhere I had become acquainted with Emmersdorf, a town which I wrongly\nsupposed to be the resting-place of the student leader Fischof, to whom\nseveral features of the dream content might refer. The thought\nassociations then lead me to England, to the house of my brother, who\nwas accustomed jokingly to tell his wife of \u201cFifty years ago,\u201d according\nto the title of a poem by Lord Tennyson, whereupon the children were in\nthe habit of correcting: \u201cFifteen years ago.\u201d This phantasy, however,\nwhich subtilely attaches itself to the thoughts which the sight of the\nCount Thun has given rise to, is only like the fa\u00e7ade of Italian\nchurches which is superimposed without being organically connected with\nthe building behind it; unlike these fa\u00e7ades, however, the phantasy is\nfilled with gaps and confused, and the parts from within break through\nat many places. The first situation of the dream is concocted from\nseveral scenes, into which I am able to separate it. The arrogant\nattitude of the Count in the dream is copied from a scene at the\nGymnasium which took place in my fifteenth year. We had contrived a\nconspiracy against an unpopular and ignorant teacher, the leading spirit\nin which was a schoolmate who seems to have taken Henry VIII. of England\nas his model. It fell to me to carry out the _coup-d\u2019\u00e9tat_, and a\ndiscussion of the importance of the Danube (German _Donau_) for Austria\n(Wachau!) was the occasion upon which matters came to open indignation.\nA fellow-conspirator was the only aristocratic schoolmate whom we had\u2014he\nwas called the \u201cgiraffe\u201d on account of his conspicuous longitudinal\ndevelopment\u2014and he stood just like the Count in the dream, while he was\nbeing reprimanded by the tyrant of the school, the Professor of the\nGerman language. The explanation of the favourite flower and the putting\ninto the buttonhole of something which again must have been a flower\n(which recalls the orchids, which I had brought to a lady friend on the\nsame day, and besides that the rose of Jericho) prominently recalls the\nscene in Shakespeare\u2019s historical plays which opens the civil wars of\nthe Red and the White Roses; the mention of Henry VIII. has opened the\nway to this reminiscence. It is not very far now from roses to red and\nwhite carnations. Meanwhile two little rhymes, the one German, the other\nSpanish, insinuate themselves into the analysis: \u201cRoses, tulips,\ncarnations, all flowers fade,\u201d and \u201cIsabelita, no llores que se\nmarchitan las flores.\u201d The Spanish is taken from _Figaro_. Here in\nVienna white carnations have become the insignia of the Anti-Semites,\nthe red ones of the Social Democrats. Behind this is the recollection of\nan anti-Semitic challenge during a railway trip in beautiful Saxony\n(Anglo-Saxon). The third scene contributing to the formation of the\nfirst situation in the dream takes place in my early student life. There\nwas a discussion in the German students\u2019 club about the relation of\nphilosophy to the general sciences. A green youth, full of the\nmaterialistic doctrine, I thrust myself forward and defended a very\none-sided view. Thereupon a sagacious older school-fellow, who has since\nshown his capacity for leading men and organising the masses, and who,\nmoreover, bears a name belonging to the animal kingdom, arose and called\nus down thoroughly; he too, he said, had herded swine in his youth, and\nhad come back repentant to the house of his father. I started up (as in\nthe dream), became very uncivil, and answered that since I knew he had\nherded swine, I was not surprised at the tone of his discourse. (In the\ndream I am surprised at my national German sentiment.) There was great\ncommotion; and the demand came from all sides that I take back what I\nhad said, but I remained steadfast. The man who had been insulted was\ntoo sensible to take the advice, which was given him, to send a\nchallenge, and let the matter drop.\nThe remaining elements of this scene of the dream are of more remote\norigin. What is the meaning of the Count\u2019s proclaiming the colt\u2019s foot?\nHere I must consult my train of associations. Colt\u2019s-foot (German:\n_Huflattich_)\u2014lattice\u2014lettuce\u2014salad-dog (the dog that grudges others\nwhat he cannot eat himself). Here plenty of opprobrious epithets may be\ndiscerned: Gir-affe (German _Affe_ = monkey, ape), pig, sow, dog; I\nmight even find means to arrive at donkey, on a detour by way of a name,\nand thus again at contempt for an academic teacher. Furthermore I\ntranslate colt\u2019s-foot (_Huflattich_)\u2014I do not know how correctly\u2014by\n\u201cpisse-en-lit.\u201d I got this idea from Zola\u2019s _Germinal_, in which\nchildren are ordered to bring salad of this kind. The dog\u2014_chien_\u2014has a\nname sounding like the major function (_chier_, as _pisser_ stands for\nthe minor one). Now we shall soon have before us the indecent in all\nthree of its categories; for in the same _Germinal_, which has a lot to\ndo with the future revolution there is described a very peculiar\ncontest, depending upon the production of gaseous excretions, called\nflatus.[BK] And now I must remark how the way to this flatus has been\nfor a long while preparing, beginning with the flowers, and proceeding\nto the Spanish rhyme of Isabelita to Ferdinand and Isabella, and, by way\nof Henry VIII., to English history at the time of the expedition of the\nArmada against England, after the victorious termination of which the\nEnglish struck a medal with the inscription: \u201c_Afflavit_ et dissipati\nsunt,\u201d for the storm had scattered the Spanish fleet. I had thought of\ntaking this phrase for the title of a chapter on \u201cTherapeutics\u201d\u2014to be\nmeant half jokingly\u2014if I should ever have occasion to give a detailed\naccount of my conception and treatment of hysteria.\nI cannot give such a detailed solution of the second scene of the dream,\nout of regard for the censor. For at this point I put myself in the\nplace of a certain eminent gentleman of that revolutionary period, who\nalso had an adventure with an eagle, who is said to have suffered from\nincontinence of the bowels, and the like; and I believe I _should not be\njustified at this point in passing_ the censor, although it was an aulic\ncouncillor (_aula_, _consilarius aulicus_) who told me the greater part\nof these stories. The allusion to the suite of rooms in the dream\nrelates to the private car of his Excellency, into which I had\nopportunity to look for a moment; but it signifies, as so often in\ndreams, a woman (Frauenzimmer; German _Zimmer_\u2014room is appended to\n_Frauen_\u2014woman, in order to imply a slight amount of contempt).[BL] In\nthe person of the housekeeper I give scant recognition to an intelligent\nelderly lady for the entertainment and the many good stories which I\nhave enjoyed at her house.... The feature of the lamp goes back to\nGrillparzer, who notes a charming experience of a similar nature, which\nhe afterwards made use of in \u201cHero and Leander\u201d (the billows of the\nocean and of love\u2014the Armada and the storm).[BM]\nI must also forgo detailed analysis of the two remaining portions of the\ndream; I shall select only those elements which lead to two childhood\nscenes, for the sake of which alone I have taken up the dream. The\nreader will guess that it is sexual matter which forces me to this\nsuppression; but he need not be content with this explanation. Many\nthings which must be treated as secrets in the presence of others are\nnot treated as such with one\u2019s self, and here it is not a question of\nconsiderations inducing me to hide the solution, but of motives of the\ninner censor concealing the real content of the dream from myself. I may\nsay, then, that the analysis shows these three portions of the dream to\nbe impertinent boasting, the exuberance of an absurd grandiose idea\nwhich has long since been suppressed in my waking life, which, however,\ndares show itself in the manifest dream content by one or two\nprojections (_I seem clever to myself_), and which makes the arrogant\nmood of the evening before the dream perfectly intelligible. It is\nboasting, indeed, in all departments; thus the mention of Graz refers to\nthe phrase: What is the price of Graz? which we are fond of using when\nwe feel over-supplied with money. Whoever will recall Master Rabelais\u2019s\nunexcelled description of the \u201cLife and Deeds of Gargantua and his Son\nPantagruel,\u201d will be able to supply the boastful content intimated in\nthe first portion of the dream. The following belongs to the two\nchildhood scenes which have been promised. I had bought a new trunk for\nthis journey, whose colour, a brownish violet, appears in the dream\nseveral times. (Violet-brown violets made of stiff material, next to a\nthing which is called \u201cgirl-catcher\u201d\u2014the furniture in the governmental\nchambers). That something new attracts people\u2019s attention is a\nwell-known belief of children. Now I have been told the following story\nof my childhood; I remember hearing the story rather than the occurrence\nitself. I am told that at the age of two I still occasionally wetted my\nbed, that I was often reproached on this subject, and that I consoled my\nfather by promising to buy him a beautiful new red bed in N. (the\nnearest large city). (Hence the detail inserted in the dream that _we\nbought the urinal in the city or had to buy it_; one must keep one\u2019s\npromises. Attention is further called to the identity of the male urinal\nand the feminine trunk, box). All the megalomania of the child is\ncontained in this promise. The significance of the dream of difficulty\nin urinating in the case of the child has been already considered in the\ninterpretation of an earlier dream (_cf._ the dream on p. 145).\nNow there was another domestic occurrence, when I was seven or eight\nyears old, which I remember very well. One evening, before going to bed\nI had disregarded the dictates of discretion not to satisfy my wants in\nthe bedroom of my parents and in their presence, and in his reprimand\nfor this delinquency my father made the remark: \u201cThat boy will never\namount to anything.\u201d It must have terribly mortified my ambition, for\nallusions to this scene return again and again in my dreams, and are\nregularly coupled with enumerations of my accomplishments and successes,\nas though I wanted to say: \u201cYou see, I have amounted to something after\nall.\u201d Now this childhood scene furnishes the elements for the last image\nof the dream, in which of course, the r\u00f4les are interchanged for the\nsake of revenge. The elderly man, obviously my father, for the blindness\nin one eye signifies his glaucoma[BN] on one side is now urinating\nbefore me as I once urinated before him. In glaucoma I refer to cocaine,\nwhich stood my father in good stead in his operation, as though I had\nthereby fulfilled my promises. Besides that I make sport of him; since\nhe is blind I must hold the urinal in front of him, and I gloat over\nallusions to my discoveries in the theory of hysteria, of which I am so\nproud.[BO]\nIf the two childhood scenes of urinating are otherwise closely connected\nwith the desire for greatness, their rehabilitation on the trip to the\nAussee was further favoured by the accidental circumstance that my\ncompartment had no water-closet, and that I had to expect embarrassment\non the ride as actually happened in the morning. I awoke with the\nsensation of a bodily need. I suppose one might be inclined to credit\nthese sensations with being the actual stimulus of the dream; I should,\nhowever, prefer a different conception\u2014namely, that it was the dream\nthoughts which gave rise to the desire to urinate. It is quite unusual\nfor me to be disturbed in sleep by any need, at least at the time of\nthis awakening, a quarter of four in the morning. I may forestall\nfurther objection by remarking that I have hardly ever felt a desire to\nurinate after awakening early on other journeys made under more\ncomfortable circumstances. Moreover, I can leave this point undecided\nwithout hurting my argument.\nSince I have learned, further, from experience in dream analysis that\nthere always remain important trains of thought proceeding from dreams\nwhose interpretation at first seems complete (because the sources of the\ndream and the actuation of the wish are easily demonstrable), trains of\nthought reaching back into earliest childhood, I have been forced to ask\nmyself whether this feature does not constitute an essential condition\nof dreaming. If I were to generalise this thesis, a connection with what\nhas been recently experienced would form a part of the manifest content\nof every dream and a connection with what has been most remotely\nexperienced, of its latent content; and I can actually show in the\nanalysis of hysteria that in a true sense these remote experiences have\nremained recent up to the present time. But this conjecture seems still\nvery difficult to prove; I shall probably have to return to the part\nplayed by the earliest childhood experiences, in another connection\n(Chapter VII.).\nOf the three peculiarities of dream memory considered at the beginning,\none\u2014the preference for the unimportant in the dream content\u2014has been\nsatisfactorily explained by tracing it back to dream disfigurement. We\nhave been able to establish the existence of the other two\u2014the selection\nof recent and of infantile material\u2014but we have found it impossible to\nexplain them by the motive of dream. Let us keep in mind these two\ncharacteristics, which still remain to be explained or evaluated; a\nplace for them will have to be found elsewhere, either in the psychology\nof the sleeping state, or in the discussion of the structure of the\npsychic apparatus which we shall undertake later, after we have learned\nthat the inner nature of the apparatus may be observed through dream\ninterpretation as though through a window.\nJust here I may emphasize another result of the last few dream analyses.\nThe dream often appears ambiguous; not only may several\nwish-fulfilments, as the examples show, be united in it, but one meaning\nor one wish-fulfilment may also conceal another, until at the bottom one\ncomes upon the fulfilment of a wish from the earliest period of\nchildhood; and here too, it may be questioned whether \u201coften\u201d in this\nsentence may not more correctly be replaced by \u201cregularly.\u201d\n(_c_) _Somatic Sources of Dreams_\nIf the attempt be made to interest the cultured layman in the problems\nof dreaming, and if, with this end in view, he be asked the question\nfrom what source dreams originate according to his opinion, it is\ngenerally found that the person thus interrogated thinks himself in\nassured possession of a part of the solution. He immediately thinks of\nthe influence which a disturbed or impeded digestion (\u201cDreams come from\nthe stomach\u201d), accidental bodily position, and little occurrences during\nsleep, exercise upon the formation of dreams, and he seems not to\nsuspect that even after the consideration of all these factors there\nstill remains something unexplained.\nWe have explained at length in the introductory chapter (p. 16), what a\nr\u00f4le in the formation of dreams the scientific literature credits to the\naccount of somatic exciting sources, so that we need here only recall\nthe results of this investigation. We have seen that three kinds of\nsomatic exciting sources are distinguished, objective sensory stimuli\nwhich proceed from external objects, the inner states of excitation of\nthe sensory organs having only a subjective basis, and the bodily\nstimuli which originate internally; and we have noticed the inclination\non the part of the authors to force the psychic sources of the dream\ninto the background or to disregard them altogether in favour of these\nsomatic sources of stimulation (p. 32).\nIn testing the claims which are made on behalf of these classes of\nsomatic sources of stimulation, we have discovered that the significance\nof the objective stimuli of the sensory organs\u2014whether accidental\nstimuli during sleep or those stimuli which cannot be excluded from our\ndormant psychic life\u2014has been definitely established by numerous\nobservations and is confirmed by experiments (p. 18); we have seen that\nthe part played by subjective sensory stimuli appears to be demonstrated\nby the return of hypnogogic sensory images in dreams, and that although\nthe referring of these dream images and ideas, in the broadest sense, to\ninternal bodily stimulation is not demonstrable in every detail, it can\nbe supported by the well-known influence which an exciting state of the\ndigestive, urinary, and sexual organs exercise upon the contents of our\ndreams.\n\u201cNerve stimulus\u201d and \u201cbodily stimulus,\u201d then, would be the somatic\nsources of the dream\u2014that is, the only sources whatever of the dream,\naccording to several authors.\nBut we have already found a number of doubts, which seem to attack not\nso much the correctness of the somatic theory of stimulation as its\nadequacy.\nHowever certain all the representatives of this theory may have felt\nabout the actual facts on which it is based\u2014especially in case of the\naccidental and external nerve stimuli, which may be recognised in the\ncontent of the dream without any trouble\u2014nevertheless none of them has\nbeen able to avoid the admission that the abundant ideal content of\ndreams does not admit of explanation by external nerve-stimuli alone.\nMiss Mary Whiton Calkins[12] has tested her own dreams and those of\nanother person for a period of six weeks with this idea in mind, and has\nfound only from 13\u00b72 per cent. to 6\u00b77 per cent. in which the element of\nexternal sensory perception was demonstrable; only two cases in the\ncollection could be referred to organic sensations. Statistics here\nconfirm what a hasty glance at our own experience might have led us to\nsuspect.\nThe decision has been made repeatedly to distinguish the \u201cdream of nerve\nstimulus\u201d from the other forms of the dream as a well-established\nsub-species. Spitta[64] divided dreams into dreams of nerve stimulus and\nassociation dreams. But the solution clearly remained unsatisfactory as\nlong as the link between the somatic sources of dreams and their ideal\ncontent could not be demonstrated.\nBesides the first objection, of the inadequate frequency of external\nexciting sources, there arises as a second objection the inadequate\nexplanation of dreams offered by the introduction of this sort of dream\nsources. The representatives of the theory accordingly must explain two\nthings, in the first place, why the external stimulus in the dream is\nnever recognised according to its real nature, but is regularly mistaken\nfor something else (_cf._ the alarm-clock dreams, p. 22), and secondly,\nwhy the reaction of the receiving mind to this misrecognised stimulus\nshould result so indeterminately and changefully. As an answer to these\nquestions, we have heard from Str\u00fcmpell[66] that the mind, as a result\nof its being turned away from the outer world during sleep, is not\ncapable of giving correct interpretation to the objective sensory\nstimulus, but is forced to form illusions on the basis of the indefinite\nincitements from many directions. As expressed in his own words (p.\n108):\n\u201cAs soon as a sensation, a sensational complex, a feeling, or a psychic\nprocess in general, arises in the mind during sleep from an outer or\ninner nerve-stimulus, and is perceived by the mind, this process calls\nup sensory images, that is to say, earlier perceptions, either\nunembellished or with the psychic values belonging to them, from the\nrange of waking experiences, of which the mind has remained in\npossession. It seems to collect about itself, as it were, a greater or\nless number of such images, from which the impression which originates\nfrom the nerve-stimulus receives its psychic value. It is usually said\nhere, as the idiom does of waking thought, that the mind _interprets_\nimpressions of nerve-stimuli in sleep. The result of this interpretation\nis the so-called nerve-stimulus dream\u2014that is to say, a dream whose\ncomposition is conditioned by the fact that a nerve-stimulus brings\nabout its effect in psychic life according to the laws of reproduction.\u201d\nThe opinion of Wundt[76] agrees in all essentials with this theory. He\nsays that the ideas in the dream are probably the result, for the most\npart, of sensory stimuli, especially of those of general sensation, and\nare therefore mostly phantastic illusions\u2014probably memory presentations\nwhich are only partly pure, and which have been raised to\nhallucinations. Str\u00fcmpell has found an excellent simile (p. 84). It is\nas \u201cif the ten fingers of a person ignorant of music should stray over\nthe keyboard of an instrument\u201d\u2014to illustrate the relation between dream\ncontent and dream stimuli, which follows from this theory. The\nimplication is that the dream does not appear as a psychic phenomenon,\noriginating from psychic motives, but as the result of a physiological\nstimulus, which is expressed in psychic symptomology, because the\napparatus which is affected by the stimulus is not capable of any other\nexpression. Upon a similar assumption is based, for example, the\nexplanation of compulsive ideas which Meynert tried to give by means of\nthe famous simile of the dial on which individual figures are prominent\nbecause they are in more marked relief.\nHowever popular this theory of somatic dream stimuli may have become,\nand however seductive it may seem, it is nevertheless easy to show the\nweak point in it. Every somatic dream stimulus which provokes the\npsychic apparatus to interpretation through the formation of illusions,\nis capable of giving rise to an incalculable number of such attempts at\ninterpretation; it can thus attain representation in the dream content\nby means of an extraordinary number of different ideas. But the theory\nof Str\u00fcmpell and Wundt is incapable of instancing any motive which has\ncontrol over the relation between the external stimulus and the dream\nidea which has been selected to interpret it, and therefore of\nexplaining the \u201cpeculiar choice\u201d which the stimuli \u201coften enough make in\nthe course of their reproductive activity\u201d (Lipps, _Grundtatsachen des\nSeelenlebens_, p. 170). Other objections may be directed against the\nfundamental assumption of the whole theory of illusions\u2014the assumption\nthat during sleep the mind is not in a condition to recognise the real\nnature of the objective sensory stimuli. The old physiologist Burdach[8]\nproves to us that the mind is quite capable even during sleep of\ninterpreting correctly the sensory impressions which reach it, and of\nreacting in accordance with the correct interpretation. He establishes\nthis by showing that it is possible to exempt certain impressions which\nseem important to the individuals, from the neglect of sleeping (nurse\nand child), and that one is more surely awakened by one\u2019s own name than\nby an indifferent auditory impression, all of which presupposes, of\ncourse, that the mind distinguishes among sensations, even in sleep\n(Chapter I., p. 41). Burdach infers from these observations that it is\nnot an incapability of interpreting sensory stimuli in the sleeping\nstate which must be assumed, but a lack of interest in them. The same\narguments which Burdach used in 1830, later reappear unchanged in the\nworks of Lipps in the year 1883, where they are employed for the purpose\nof attacking the theory of somatic stimuli. According to this the mind\nseems to be like the sleeper in the anecdote, who, upon being asked,\n\u201cAre you asleep?\u201d answers \u201cNo,\u201d and upon being again addressed with the\nwords, \u201cThen lend me ten florins,\u201d takes refuge in the excuse: \u201cI am\nasleep.\u201d\nThe inadequacy of the theory of somatic dream stimuli may also be\ndemonstrated in another manner. Observations show that I am not urged to\ndream by external stimulations, even if these stimulations appear in the\ndream as soon as, and in case that, I dream. In response to the tactile\nor pressure stimulus which I get while sleeping, various reactions are\nat my disposal. I can overlook it and discover only upon awakening that\nmy leg has been uncovered or my arm under pressure; pathology shows the\nmost numerous examples where powerfully acting sensory and motor stimuli\nof different sorts remain without effect during sleep. I can perceive a\nsensation during sleep through and through sleep, as it were, which\nhappens as a rule with painful stimuli, but without weaving the pain\ninto the texture of the dream; thirdly, I can awaken on account of the\nstimulus in order to obviate it. Only as a fourth possible reaction, I\nmay be impelled to dream by a nerve stimulus; but the other\npossibilities are realised at least as often as that of dream formation.\nThis could not be the case if the _motive for dreaming did not lie\noutside of the somatic sources of dreams_.\nTaking proper account of the defect in the explanation of dreams by\nsomatic stimuli which has just been shown, other authors\u2014Scherner,[58]\nwho was joined by the philosopher Volkelt[72]\u2014have tried to determine\nmore exactly the psychic activities which cause the variegated dream\nimages to arise from the somatic stimuli, and have thus transferred the\nessential nature of dreams back to the province of the mind, and to that\nof psychic activity. Scherner not only gave a poetically appreciative,\nglowing and vivid description of the psychic peculiarities which develop\nin the course of dream formation; he also thought he had guessed the\nprinciple according to which the mind proceeds with the stimuli that are\nat its disposal. The dream activity, according to Scherner\u2014after\nphantasy has been freed from the shackles imposed upon it during the\nday, and has been given free rein\u2014strives to represent symbolically the\nnature of the organ from which the stimulus proceeds. Thus we have a\nkind of dream-book as a guide for the interpretation of dreams, by means\nof which bodily sensations, the conditions of the organs and of the\nstimuli may be inferred from dream images. \u201cThus the image of a cat\nexpresses an angry discontented mood, the image of a light-coloured bit\nof smooth pastry the nudity of the body. The human body as a whole is\npictured as a house by the phantasy of the dream, and each individual\norgan of the body as a part of the house. In \u2018toothache-dreams\u2019 a high\nvaulted vestibule corresponds to the mouth and a stair to the descent of\nthe gullet to the alimentary canal; in the \u2018headache-dream\u2019 the ceiling\nof a room which is covered with disgusting reptile-like spiders is\nchosen to denote the upper part of the head\u201d (Volkelt, p. 39). \u201cSeveral\ndifferent symbols are used by the dream for the same organ, thus the\nbreathing lungs find their symbol in an oven filled with flames and with\na roaring draught, the heart in hollow chests and baskets, and the\nbladder in round, bag-shaped objects or anything else hollow. It is\nespecially important that at the end of a dream the stimulating organ or\nits function be represented undisguised and usually on the dreamer\u2019s own\nbody. Thus the \u2018toothache-dream\u2019 usually ends by the dreamer drawing a\ntooth from his own mouth\u201d (p. 35). It cannot be said that this theory\nhas found much favour with the authors. Above all, it seems extravagant;\nthere has been no inclination even to discover the small amount of\njustification to which it may, in my opinion, lay claim. As may be seen,\nit leads to a revival of the dream interpretation by means of symbolism,\nwhich the ancients used, except that the source from which the\ninterpretation is to be taken is limited to the human body. The lack of\na technique of interpretation which is scientifically comprehensible\nmust seriously limit the applicability of Scherner\u2019s theory.\nArbitrariness in dream interpretation seems in no wise excluded,\nespecially since a stimulus may be expressed by several representations\nin the content of the dream; thus Scherner\u2019s associate, Volkelt, has\nalready found it impossible to confirm the representation of the body as\na house. Another objection is that here again dream activity is\nattributed to the mind as a useless and aimless activity, since\naccording to the theory in question the mind is content with forming\nphantasies about the stimulus with which it is concerned, without even\nremotely contemplating anything like a discharge of the stimulus.\nBut Scherner\u2019s theory of the symbolisation of bodily stimuli by the\ndream receives a heavy blow from another objection. These bodily stimuli\nare present at all times, and according to general assumption the mind\nis more accessible to them during sleep than in waking. It is thus\nincomprehensible why the mind does not dream continually throughout the\nnight, and why it does not dream every night and about all the organs.\nIf one attempts to avoid this objection by making the condition that\nespecial stimuli must proceed from the eye, the ear, the teeth, the\nintestines in order to arouse dream activity, one is confronted by the\ndifficulty of proving that this increase of stimulation is objective,\nwhich is possible only in a small number of cases. If the dream of\nflying is a symbolisation of the upward and downward motion of the\npulmonary lobes, either this dream, as has already been remarked by\nStr\u00fcmpell, would be dreamt much oftener, or an accentuation of the\nfunction of breathing during the dream would have to be demonstrable.\nStill another case is possible\u2014the most probable of all\u2014that now and\nthen special motives directing attention to the visceral sensations\nwhich are universally present are active, but this case takes us beyond\nthe range of Scherner\u2019s theory.\nThe value of Scherner\u2019s and Volkelt\u2019s discussions lies in the fact that\nthey call attention to a number of characteristics of the dream content\nwhich are in need of explanation, and which seem to promise new\nknowledge. It is quite true that symbolisations of organs of the body\nand of their functions are contained in dreams, that water in a dream\noften signifies a desire to urinate, that the male genital may often be\nrepresented by a staff standing erect or by a pillar, &c. In dreams\nwhich show a very animated field of vision and brilliant colours, in\ncontrast to the dimness of other dreams, the interpretation may hardly\nbe dismissed that they are \u201cdreams of visual stimulation,\u201d any more than\nit may be disputed that there is a contribution of illusory formations\nin dreams which contain noise and confusion of voices. A dream like that\nof Scherner, of two rows of fair handsome boys standing opposite to each\nother on a bridge, attacking each other and then taking their places\nagain, until finally the dreamer himself sits down on the bridge and\npulls a long tooth out of his jaw; or a similar one of Volkelt\u2019s, in\nwhich two rows of drawers play a part, and which again ends in the\nextraction of a tooth; dream formations of this sort, which are related\nin great numbers by the authors, prevent our discarding Scherner\u2019s\ntheory as an idle fabrication without seeking to find its kernel of\ntruth. We are now confronted by the task of giving the supposed\nsymbolisation of the dental stimulus an explanation of a different kind.\nThroughout our consideration of the theory of the somatic sources of\ndreams, I have refrained from urging the argument which is inferred from\nour dream analyses. If we have succeeded in proving, by a procedure\nwhich other authors have not applied in their investigation of dreams,\nthat the dream as a psychic action possesses value peculiar to itself,\nthat a wish supplies the motive for its formation, and that the\nexperiences of the previous day furnish the immediate material for its\ncontent, any other theory of dreams neglecting such an important method\nof investigation, and accordingly causing the dream to appear a useless\nand problematic psychic reaction to somatic stimuli, is dismissible\nwithout any particular comment. Otherwise there must be\u2014which is highly\nimprobable\u2014two entirely different kinds of dreams, of which only one has\ncome under our observation, while only the other has been observed by\nthe earlier connoisseurs of the dream. It still remains to provide a\nplace for the facts which are used to support the prevailing theory of\nsomatic dream-stimuli, within our own theory of dreams.\nWe have already taken the first step in this direction in setting up the\nthesis that the dream activity is under a compulsion to elaborate all\nthe dream stimuli which are simultaneously present into a unified whole\n(p. 151). We have seen that when two or more experiences capable of\nmaking an impression have been left over from the previous day, the\nwishes which result from them are united into one dream; similarly, that\nan impression possessing psychic value and the indifferent experiences\nof the previous day are united in the dream material, provided there are\navailable connecting ideas between the two. Thus the dream appears to be\na reaction to everything which is simultaneously present as actual in\nthe sleeping mind. As far as we have hitherto analysed the dream\nmaterial, we have discovered it to be a collection of psychic remnants\nand memory traces, which we were obliged to credit (on account of the\npreference shown for recent and infantile material) with a character of\nactuality, though the nature of this was not at the time determinable.\nNow it will not be difficult to foretell what will happen when new\nmaterial in the form of sensations is added to these actualities of\nmemory. These stimuli likewise derive importance for the dream because\nthey are actual; they are united with the other psychic actualities in\norder to make up the material for dream formation. To express it\ndifferently, the stimuli which appear during sleep are worked over into\nthe fulfilment of a wish, the other component parts of which are the\nremnants of daily experience with which we are familiar. This union,\nhowever, is not inevitable; we have heard that more than one sort of\nattitude towards bodily stimuli is possible during sleep. Wherever this\nunion has been brought about, it has simply been possible to find for\nthe dream content that kind of presentation material which will give\nrepresentation to both classes of dream sources, the somatic as well as\nthe psychic.\nThe essential nature of the dream is not changed by this addition of\nsomatic material to the psychic sources of the dream; it remains the\nfulfilment of a wish without reference to the way in which its\nexpression is determined by the actual material.\nI shall gladly find room here for a number of peculiarities, which serve\nto put a different face on the significance of external stimuli for the\ndream. I imagine that a co-operation of individual, physiological, and\naccidental factors, conditioned by momentary circumstances, determines\nhow one will act in each particular case of intensive objective\nstimulation during sleep; the degree of the profoundness of sleep\nwhether habitual or accidental in connection with the intensity of the\nstimulus, will in one case make it possible to suppress the stimulus, so\nthat it will not disturb sleep; in another case they will force an\nawakening or will support the attempt to overcome the stimulus by\nweaving it into the texture of the dream. In correspondence with the\nmultiplicity of these combinations, external objective stimuli will\nreceive expression more frequently in the case of one person than in\nthat of another. In the case of myself, who am an excellent sleeper, and\nwho stubbornly resists any kind of disturbance in sleep, this\nintermixture of external causes of irritation into my dreams is very\nrare, while psychic motives apparently cause me to dream very easily. I\nhave indeed noted only a single dream in which an objective, painful\nsource of stimulation is demonstrable, and it will be highly instructive\nto see what effect the external stimulus had in this very dream.\n_I am riding on a grey horse, at first timidly and awkwardly, as though\nI were only leaning against something. I meet a colleague P., who is\nmounted on a horse and is wearing a heavy woollen suit; he calls my\nattention to something (probably to the fact that my riding position is\nbad). Now I become more and more expert on the horse, which is most\nintelligent; I sit comfortably, and I notice that I am already quite at\nhome in the saddle. For a saddle I have a kind of padding, which\ncompletely fills the space between the neck and the rump of the horse.\nIn this manner I ride with difficulty between two lumber-wagons. After\nhaving ridden up the street for some distance, I turn around and want to\ndismount, at first in front of a little open chapel, which is situated\nclose to the street. Then I actually dismount in front of a chapel which\nstands near the first; the hotel is in the same street, I could let the\nhorse go there by itself, but I prefer to lead it there. It seems as if\nI should be ashamed to arrive there on horseback. In front of the hotel\nis standing a hall-boy who shows me a card of mine which has been found,\nand who ridicules me on account of it. On the card is written, doubly\nunderlined, \u201cEat nothing,\u201d and then a second sentence (indistinct)\nsomething like \u201cDo not work\u201d; at the same time a hazy idea that I am in\na strange city, in which I do no work._\nIt will not be apparent at once that this dream originated under the\ninfluence, or rather under the compulsion, of a stimulus of pain. The\nday before I had suffered from furuncles, which made every movement a\ntorture, and at last a furuncle had grown to the size of an apple at the\nroot of the scrotum, and had caused me the most intolerable pains that\naccompanied every step; a feverish lassitude, lack of appetite, and the\nhard work to which I had nevertheless kept myself during the day, had\nconspired with the pain to make me lose my temper. I was not altogether\nin a condition to discharge my duties as a physician, but in view of the\nnature and the location of the malady, one might have expected some\nperformance other than riding, for which I was very especially unfitted.\nIt is this very activity, of riding into which I am plunged by the\ndream; it is the most energetic denial of the suffering which is capable\nof being conceived. In the first place, I do not know how to ride, I do\nnot usually dream of it, and I never sat on a horse but once\u2014without a\nsaddle\u2014and then I did not feel comfortable. But in this dream I ride as\nthough I had no furuncle on the perineum, and why? _just because I don\u2019t\nwant any_. According to the description my saddle is the poultice which\nhas made it possible for me to go to sleep. Probably I did not feel\nanything of my pain\u2014as I was thus taken care of\u2014during the first few\nhours of sleeping. Then the painful sensations announced themselves and\ntried to wake me up, whereupon the dream came and said soothingly: \u201cKeep\non sleeping, you won\u2019t wake up anyway! You have no furuncle at all, for\nyou are riding on a horse, and with a furuncle where you have it riding\nis impossible!\u201d And the dream was successful; the pain was stifled, and\nI went on sleeping.\nBut the dream was not satisfied with \u201csuggesting away\u201d the furuncle by\nmeans of tenaciously adhering to an idea incompatible with that of the\nmalady, in doing which it behaved like the hallucinatory insanity of the\nmother who has lost her child, or like the merchant who has been\ndeprived of his fortune by losses.[BP] In addition the details of the\ndenied sensation and of the image which is used to displace it are\nemployed by the dream as a means to connect the material ordinarily\nactually present in the mind with the dream situation, and to give this\nmaterial representation. I am riding on a _grey_ horse\u2014the colour of the\nhorse corresponds exactly to the _pepper-and-salt_ costume in which I\nlast met my colleague P. in the country. I have been warned that highly\nseasoned food is the cause of furunculosis, but in any case it is\npreferable as an etiological explanation to sugar which ordinarily\nsuggests furunculosis. My friend P. has been pleased to \u201cride the high\nhorse\u201d with regard to me, ever since he superseded me in the treatment\nof a female patient, with whom I had performed great feats (in the dream\nI first sit on the horse side-saddle fashion, like a circus rider), but\nwho really led me wherever she wished, like the horse in the anecdote\nabout the Sunday equestrian. Thus the horse came to be a symbolic\nrepresentation of a lady patient (in the dream it is most intelligent).\n\u201cI feel quite at home up here,\u201d refers to the position which I occupied\nin the patient\u2019s household until I was replaced by my colleague P. \u201cI\nthought you were securely seated in the saddle,\u201d one of my few\nwell-wishers among the great physicians of this city recently said to me\nwith reference to the same household. And it was a feat to practise\npsychotherapy for ten hours a day with such pains, but I know that I\ncannot continue my particularly difficult work for any length of time\nwithout complete physical health, and the dream is full of gloomy\nallusions to the situation which must in that case result (the card such\nas neurasthenics have and present to doctors): _No work and no food_.\nWith further interpretation I see that the dream activity has succeeded\nin finding the way from the wish-situation of riding to very early\ninfantile scenes of quarrelling, which must have taken place between me\nand my nephew, who is now living in England, and who, moreover, is a\nyear older than I. Besides it has taken up elements from my journeys to\nItaly; the street in the dream is composed of impressions of Verona and\nSiena. Still more exhaustive interpretation leads to sexual\ndream-thoughts, and I recall what significance dream allusions to that\nbeautiful country had in the case of a female patient who had never been\nin Italy (Itlay\u2014German _gen Italien_\u2014_Genitalien_\u2014genitals). At the same\ntime there are references to the house in which I was physician before\nmy friend P., and to the place where the furuncle is located.\nAmong the dreams mentioned in the previous chapter there are several\nwhich might serve as examples for the elaboration of so-called nerve\nstimuli. The dream about drinking in full draughts is one of this sort;\nthe somatic excitement in it seems to be the only source of the dream,\nand the wish resulting from the sensation\u2014thirst\u2014the only motive for\ndreaming. Something similar is true of the other simple dreams, if the\nsomatic excitement alone is capable of forming a wish. The dream of the\nsick woman who throws the cooling apparatus from her cheek at night is\nan instance of a peculiar way of reacting to painful excitements with a\nwish-fulfilment; it seems as though the patient had temporarily\nsucceeded in making herself analgesic by ascribing her pains to a\nstranger.\nMy dream about the three Parc\u00e6 is obviously a dream of hunger, but it\nhas found means to refer the need for food back to the longing of the\nchild for its mother\u2019s breast, and to make the harmless desire a cloak\nfor a more serious one, which is not permitted to express itself so\nopenly. In the dream about Count Thun we have seen how an accidental\nbodily desire is brought into connection with the strongest, and\nlikewise the most strongly suppressed emotions of the psychic life. And\nwhen the First Consul incorporates the sound of an exploding bomb into a\ndream of battle before it causes him to wake, as in the case reported by\nGarnier, the purpose for which psychic activity generally concerns\nitself with sensations occurring during sleep is revealed with\nextraordinary clearness. A young lawyer, who has been deeply preoccupied\nwith his first great bankruptcy proceeding, and who goes to sleep during\nthe afternoon following, acts just like the great Napoleon. He dreams\nabout a certain G. Reich in _Hussiatyn_ (German _husten_\u2014to cough), whom\nhe knows in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding, but _Hussiatyn_\nforces itself upon his attention still further, with the result that he\nis obliged to awaken, and hears his wife\u2014who is suffering from bronchial\ncatarrh\u2014coughing violently.\nLet us compare the dream of Napoleon I., who, incidentally, was an\nexcellent sleeper, with that of the sleepy student, who was awakened by\nhis landlady with the admonition that he must go to the hospital, who\nthereupon dreams himself into a bed in the hospital, and then sleeps on,\nwith the following account of his motives: If I am already in the\nhospital, I shan\u2019t have to get up in order to go there. The latter is\nobviously a dream of convenience; the sleeper frankly admits to himself\nthe motive for his dreaming; but he thereby reveals one of the secrets\nof dreaming in general. In a certain sense all dreams are dreams of\nconvenience; they serve the purpose of continuing sleep instead of\nawakening. _The dream is the guardian of sleep, not the disturber of\nit._ We shall justify this conception with respect to the psychic\nfactors of awakening elsewhere; it is possible, however, at this point\nto prove its applicability to the influence exerted by objective\nexternal excitements. Either the mind does not concern itself at all\nwith the causes of sensations, if it is able to do this in spite of\ntheir intensity and of their significance, which is well understood by\nit; or it employs the dream to deny these stimuli; or thirdly, if it is\nforced to recognise the stimulus, it seeks to find that interpretation\nof the stimulus which shall represent the actual sensation as a\ncomponent part of a situation which is desired and which is compatible\nwith sleep. The actual sensation is woven into the dream _in order to\ndeprive it of its reality_. Napoleon is permitted to go on sleeping; it\nis only a dream recollection of the thunder of the cannon at Arcole\nwhich is trying to disturb him.[BQ]\n_The wish to sleep, by which the conscious ego has been suspended and\nwhich along with the dream-censor contributes its share to the dream,\nmust thus always be taken into account as a motive for the formation of\ndreams, and every successful dream is a fulfilment of this wish._ The\nrelation of this general, regularly present, and invariable sleep-wish\nto the other wishes, of which now the one, now the other is fulfilled,\nwill be the subject of a further explanation. In the wish to sleep we\nhave discovered a factor capable of supplying the deficiency in the\ntheory of Str\u00fcmpell and Wundt, and of explaining the perversity and\ncapriciousness in the interpretation of the outer stimulus. The correct\ninterpretation, of which the sleeping mind is quite capable, would imply\nan active interest and would require that sleep be terminated; hence, of\nthose interpretations which are possible at all, only those are admitted\nwhich are agreeable to the absolute censorship of the somatic wish. It\nis something like this: It\u2019s the nightingale and not the lark. For if\nit\u2019s the lark, love\u2019s night is at an end. From among the interpretations\nof the excitement which are at the moment possible, that one is selected\nwhich can secure the best connection with the wish-possibilities that\nare lying in wait in the mind. Thus everything is definitely determined,\nand nothing is left to caprice. The misinterpretation is not an\nillusion, but\u2014if you will\u2014an excuse. Here again, however, there is\nadmitted an action which is a modification of the normal psychic\nprocedure, as in the case where substitution by means of displacement is\neffected for the purposes of the dream-censor.\nIf the outer nerve stimuli and inner bodily stimuli are sufficiently\nintense to compel psychic attention, they represent\u2014that is, in case\nthey result in dreaming and not in awakening\u2014a definite point in the\nformation of dreams, a nucleus in the dream material, for which an\nappropriate wish-fulfilment is sought, in a way similar (see above) to\nthe search for connecting ideas between two dream stimuli. To this\nextent it is true for a number of dreams that the somatic determines\nwhat their content is to be. In this extreme case a wish which is not\nexactly actual is aroused for the purpose of dream formation. But the\ndream can do nothing but represent a wish in a situation as fulfilled;\nit is, as it were, confronted by the task of seeking what wish may be\nrepresented and fulfilled by means of the situation which is now actual.\nEven if this actual material is of a painful or disagreeable character,\nstill it is not useless for the purposes of dream formation. The psychic\nlife has control even over wishes the fulfilment of which brings forth\npleasure\u2014a statement which seems contradictory, but which becomes\nintelligible if one takes into account the presence of two psychic\ninstances and the censor existing between them.\nThere are in the psychic life, as we have heard, _repressed_ wishes\nwhich belong to the first system, and to whose fulfilment the second\nsystem is opposed. There are wishes of this kind\u2014and we do not mean this\nin an historic sense, that there have been such wishes and that these\nhave then been destroyed\u2014but the theory of repression, which is\nessential to the study of psychoneurosis, asserts that such repressed\nwishes still exist, contemporaneously with an inhibition weighing them\ndown. Language has hit upon the truth when it speaks of the\n\u201csuppression\u201d of such impulses. The psychic contrivance for bringing\nsuch wishes to realisation remains preserved and in a condition to be\nused. But if it happens that such a suppressed wish is fulfilled, the\nvanquished inhibition of the second system (which is capable of becoming\nconscious) is then expressed as a painful feeling. To close this\ndiscussion; if sensations of a disagreeable character which originate\nfrom somatic sources are presented during sleep, this constellation is\ntaken advantage of by the dream activity to represent the\nfulfilment\u2014with more or less retention of the censor\u2014of an otherwise\nsuppressed wish.\nThis condition of affairs makes possible a number of anxiety dreams,\nwhile another series of the dream formations which are unfavourable to\nthe wish theory exhibits a different mechanism. For anxiety in dreams\nmay be of a psychoneurotic nature, or it may originate in psychosexual\nexcitements, in which case the anxiety corresponds to a repressed\n_libido_. Then this anxiety as well as the whole anxiety dream has the\nsignificance of a neurotic symptom, and we are at the dividing-line\nwhere the wish-fulfilling tendency of dreams disappears. But in other\nanxiety-dreams the feeling of anxiety comes from somatic sources (for\ninstance in the case of persons suffering from pulmonary or heart\ntrouble, where there is occasional difficulty in getting breath), and\nthen it is used to aid those energetically suppressed wishes in\nattaining fulfilment in the form of a dream, the dreaming of which from\npsychic motives would have resulted in the same release of fear. It is\nnot difficult to unite these two apparently discrepant cases. Of two\npsychic formations, an emotional inclination and an ideal content, which\nare intimately connected, the one, which is presented as actual,\nsupports the other in the dream; now anxiety of somatic origin supports\nthe suppressed presentation content, now the ideal content, which is\nfreed from suppression, and which proceeds with the impetus given by\nsexual emotion, assists the discharge of anxiety. Of the one case it may\nbe said that an emotion of somatic origin is psychically interpreted; in\nthe other case everything is of psychic origin but the content which has\nbeen suppressed is easily replaced by a somatic interpretation which is\nsuited to anxiety. The difficulties which lie in the way of\nunderstanding all this have little to do with the dream; they are due to\nthe fact that in discussing these points we are touching upon the\nproblems of the development of anxiety and of repression.\nUndoubtedly the aggregate of bodily feelings is to be included among the\ncommanding dream stimuli which originate internally. Not that it is able\nto furnish the dream content, but it forces the dream thoughts to make a\nchoice from the material destined to serve the purpose of representation\nin the dream content; it does this by putting within easy reach that\npart of the material which is suited to its own character, while\nwithholding the other. Moreover this general feeling, which is left over\nfrom the day, is probably connected with the psychic remnants which are\nsignificant for the dream.\nIf somatic sources of excitement occurring during sleep\u2014that is, the\nsensations of sleep\u2014are not of unusual intensity, they play a part in\nthe formation of dreams similar, in my judgment, to that of the\nimpressions of the day which have remained recent but indifferent. I\nmean that they are drawn into the dream formation, if they are qualified\nfor being united with the presentation content of the psychic\ndream-source, but in no other case. They are treated as a cheap\never-ready material, which is utilised as often as it is needed, instead\nof prescribing, as a precious material does, the manner in which it is\nto be utilised. The case is similar to that where a patron of art brings\nto an artist a rare stone, a fragment of onyx, in order that a work of\nart may be made of it. The size of the stone, its colour, and its\nmarking help to decide what bust or what scene shall be represented in\nit, while in the case where there is a uniform and abundant supply of\nmarble or sandstone the artist follows only the idea which takes shape\nin his mind. Only in this manner, it seems to me, is the fact explicable\nthat the dream content resulting from bodily excitements that have not\nbeen accentuated to a usual degree, does not appear in all dreams and\nduring every night.\nPerhaps an example, which takes us back to the interpretation of dreams,\nwill best illustrate my meaning. One day I was trying to understand the\nmeaning of the sensations of being impeded, of not being able to move\nfrom the spot, of not being able to get finished, &c., which are dreamt\nabout so often, and which are so closely allied to anxiety. That night I\nhad the following dream: _I am very incompletely dressed, and I go from\na dwelling on the ground floor up a flight of stairs to an upper story.\nIn doing this I jump over three steps at a time, and I am glad to find I\ncan mount the steps so quickly. Suddenly I see that a servant girl is\ncoming down the stairs, that is, towards me. I am ashamed and try to\nhurry away, and now there appears that sensation of being impeded; I am\nglued to the steps and cannot move from the spot._\nAnalysis: The situation of the dream is taken from everyday reality. In\na house in Vienna I have two apartments, which are connected only by a\nflight of stairs outside. My consultation-rooms and my study are on an\nelevated portion of the ground floor, and one story higher are my\nliving-rooms. When I have finished my work downstairs late at night, I\ngo up the steps into my bedroom. On the evening before the dream I had\nactually gone this short distance in a somewhat disorderly attire\u2014that\nis to say, I had taken off my collar, cravat, and cuffs; but in the\ndream this has changed into a somewhat more advanced degree of undress,\nwhich as usual is indefinite. Jumping over the steps is my usual method\nof mounting stairs; moreover it is the fulfilment of a wish that has\nbeen recognised in the dream, for I have reassured myself about the\ncondition of my heart action by the ease of this accomplishment.\nMoreover the manner in which I climb the stairs is an effective contrast\nto the sensation of being impeded which occurs in the second half of the\ndream. It shows me\u2014something which needed no proof\u2014that the dream has no\ndifficulty in representing motor actions as carried out fully and\ncompletely; think of flying in dreams!\nBut the stairs which I go up are not those of my house; at first I do\nnot recognise them; only the person coming toward me reveals to me the\nlocation which they are intended to signify. This woman is the maid of\nthe old lady whom I visit twice daily to give hypodermic injections; the\nstairs, too, are quite similar to those which I must mount there twice\ndaily.\nHow do this flight of stairs and this woman get into my dream? Being\nashamed because one is not fully dressed, is undoubtedly of a sexual\ncharacter; the servant of whom I dream is older than I, sulky, and not\nin the least attractive. These questions call up exactly the following\noccurrences: When I make my morning visit at this house I am usually\nseized with a desire to clear my throat; the product of the\nexpectoration falls upon the steps. For there is no spittoon on either\nof these floors, and I take the view that the stairs should not be kept\nclean at my expense, but by the provision of a spittoon. The\nhousekeeper, likewise an elderly and sulky person, with instincts for\ncleanliness, takes another view of the matter. She lies in wait for me\nto see whether I take the liberty referred to, and when she has made\nsure of it, I hear her growl distinctly. For days thereafter she refuses\nto show me her customary regard when we meet. On the day before the\ndream the position of the housekeeper had been strengthened by the\nservant girl. I had just finished my usual hurried visit to the patient\nwhen the servant confronted me in the ante-room and observed: \u201cYou might\nas well have wiped your shoes to-day, doctor, before you came into the\nroom. The red carpet is all dirty again from your feet.\u201d This is the\nwhole claim which the flight of stairs and the servant-girl can make for\nappearing in my dream.\nAn intimate connection exists between my flying over the stairs and my\nspitting on the stairs. Pharyngitis and diseases of the heart are both\nsaid to be punishments for the vice of smoking, on account of which\nvice, of course, I do not enjoy a reputation for great neatness with my\nhousekeeper in the one house any more than in the other, both of which\nthe dream fuses into a single image.\nI must postpone the further interpretation of this dream until I can\ngive an account of the origin of the typical dream of incomplete dress.\nI only note as a preliminary result from the dream which has just been\ncited that the dream sensation of inhibited action is always aroused at\na point where a certain connection requires it. A peculiar condition of\nmy motility during sleep cannot be the cause of this dream content, for\na moment before I saw myself hurrying over the steps with ease, as\nthough in confirmation of this fact.\n(_d_) _Typical Dreams_\nIn general we are not in a position to interpret the dream of another\nperson if he is unwilling to furnish us with the unconscious thoughts\nwhich lie behind the dream content, and for this reason the practical\napplicability of our method of dream interpretation is seriously\ncurtailed.[BR] But there are a certain number of dreams\u2014in contrast with\nthe usual freedom displayed by the individual in fashioning his dream\nworld with characteristic peculiarity, and thereby making it\nunintelligible\u2014which almost every one has dreamed in the same manner,\nand of which we are accustomed to assume that they have the same\nsignificance in the case of every dreamer. A peculiar interest belongs\nto these typical dreams for the reason that they probably all come from\nthe same sources with every person, that they are thus particularly\nsuited to give us information upon the sources of dreams.\nTypical dreams are worthy of the most exhaustive investigation. I shall,\nhowever, only give a somewhat detailed consideration to examples of this\nspecies, and for this purpose I shall first select the so-called\nembarrassment dream of nakedness, and the dream of the death of dear\nrelatives.\nThe dream of being naked or scantily clad in the presence of strangers\noccurs with the further addition that one is not at all ashamed of it,\n&c. But the dream of nakedness is worthy of our interest only when shame\nand embarrassment are felt in it, when one wishes to flee or to hide,\nand when one feels the strange inhibition that it is impossible to move\nfrom the spot and that one is incapable of altering the disagreeable\nsituation. It is only in this connection that the dream is typical; the\nnucleus of its content may otherwise be brought into all kinds of\nrelations or may be replaced by individual amplifications. It is\nessentially a question of a disagreeable sensation of the nature of\nshame, the wish to be able to hide one\u2019s nakedness, chiefly by means of\nlocomotion, without being able to accomplish this. I believe that the\ngreat majority of my readers will at some time have found themselves in\nthis situation in a dream.\nUsually the nature and manner of the experience is indistinct. It is\nusually reported, \u201cI was in my shirt,\u201d but this is rarely a clear image;\nin most cases the lack of clothing is so indeterminate that it is\ndesignated in the report of the dream by a set of alternatives: \u201cI was\nin my chemise or in my petticoat.\u201d As a rule the deficiency in the\ntoilet is not serious enough to justify the feeling of shame attached to\nit. For a person who has served in the army, nakedness is often replaced\nby a mode of adjustment that is contrary to regulations. \u201cI am on the\nstreet without my sabre and I see officers coming,\u201d or \u201cI am without my\nnecktie,\u201d or \u201cI am wearing checkered civilian\u2019s trousers,\u201d &c.\nThe persons before whom one is ashamed are almost always strangers with\nfaces that have been left undetermined. It never occurs in the typical\ndream that one is reproved or even noticed on account of the dress which\ncauses the embarrassment to one\u2019s self. Quite on the contrary, the\npeople have an air of indifference, or, as I had opportunity to observe\nin a particularly clear dream, they look stiffly solemn. This is worth\nthinking about.\nThe shamed embarrassment of the dreamer and the indifference of the\nspectators form a contradiction which often occurs in the dream. It\nwould better accord with the feelings of the dreamer if the strangers\nlooked at him in astonishment and laughed at him, or if they grew\nindignant. I think, however, that the latter unpleasant feature has been\nobviated by the tendency to wish-fulfilment, while the embarrassment,\nbeing retained on some account or other, has been left standing, and\nthus the two parts fail to agree. We have interesting evidence to show\nthat the dream, whose appearance has been partially disfigured by the\ntendency to wish-fulfilment, has not been properly understood. For it\nhas become the basis of a fairy tale familiar to us all in Andersen\u2019s\nversion,[BS] and it has recently received poetic treatment by L. Fulda\nin the _Talisman_. In Andersen\u2019s fairy tale we are told of two impostors\nwho weave a costly garment for the Emperor, which, however, shall be\nvisible only to the good and true. The Emperor goes forth clad in this\ninvisible garment, and, the fabric serving as a sort of touchstone, all\nthe people are frightened into acting as though they did not notice the\nnakedness of the Emperor.\nBut such is the situation in our dream. It does not require great\nboldness to assume that the unintelligible dream content has suggested\nthe invention of a state of undress in which the situation that is being\nremembered becomes significant. This situation has then been deprived of\nits original meaning, and placed at the service of other purposes. But\nwe shall see that such misunderstanding of the dream content often\noccurs on account of the conscious activity of the second psychic\nsystem, and is to be recognised as a factor in the ultimate formation of\nthe dream; furthermore, that in the development of the obsessions and\nphobias similar misunderstandings, likewise within the same psychic\npersonality, play a leading part. The source from which in our dream the\nmaterial for this transformation is taken can also be explained. The\nimpostor is the dream, the Emperor is the dreamer himself, and the\nmoralising tendency betrays a hazy knowledge of the fact that the latent\ndream content is occupied with forbidden wishes which have become the\nvictims of repression. The connection in which such dreams appear during\nmy analysis of neurotics leaves no room for doubting that the dream is\nbased upon a recollection from earliest childhood. Only in our childhood\nwas there a time when we were seen by our relatives as well as by\nstrange nurses, servant girls, and visitors, in scanty clothing, and at\nthat time we were not ashamed of our nakedness.[BT]\nIt may be observed in the case of children who are a little older that\nbeing undressed has a kind of intoxicating effect upon them, instead of\nmaking them ashamed. They laugh, jump about, and strike their bodies;\nthe mother, or whoever is present, forbids them to do this, and says:\n\u201cFie, that is shameful\u2014you mustn\u2019t do that.\u201d Children often show\nexhibitional cravings; it is hardly possible to go through a village in\nour part of the country without meeting a two or three-year-old tot who\nlifts up his or her shirt before the traveller, perhaps in his honour.\nOne of my patients has reserved in his conscious memory a scene from the\neighth year of his life in which he had just undressed previous to going\nto bed, and was about to dance into the room of his little sister in his\nundershirt when the servant prevented his doing it. In the childhood\nhistory of neurotics, denudation in the presence of children of the\nopposite sex plays a great part; in paranoia the desire to be observed\nwhile dressing and undressing may be directly traced to these\nexperiences; among those remaining perverted there is a class which has\naccentuated the childish impulse to a compulsion\u2014they are the\nexhibitionists.\nThis age of childhood in which the sense of shame is lacking seems to\nour later recollections a Paradise, and Paradise itself is nothing but a\ncomposite phantasy from the childhood of the individual. It is for this\nreason, too, that in Paradise human beings are naked and are not ashamed\nuntil the moment arrives when the sense of shame and of fear are\naroused; expulsion follows, and sexual life and cultural development\nbegin. Into this Paradise the dream can take us back every night; we\nhave already ventured the conjecture that the impressions from earliest\nchildhood (from the prehistoric period until about the end of the fourth\nyear) in themselves, and independently of everything else, crave\nreproduction, perhaps without further reference to their content, and\nthat the repetition of them is the fulfilment of a wish. Dreams of\nnakedness, then, are exhibition dreams.[BU]\nOne\u2019s own person, which is seen not as that of a child, but as belonging\nto the present, and the idea of scanty clothing, which became buried\nbeneath so many later _n\u00e9glig\u00e9e_ recollections or because of the censor,\nturns out to be obscure\u2014these two things constitute the nucleus of the\nexhibition dream. Next come the persons before whom one is ashamed. I\nknow of no example where the actual spectators at those infantile\nexhibitions reappear in the dream. For the dream is hardly ever a simple\nrecollection. Strangely enough, those persons who are the objects of our\nsexual interest during childhood are omitted from all the reproductions\nof the dream, of hysteria, and of the compulsion neurosis; paranoia\nalone puts the spectators back into their places, and is fanatically\nconvinced of their presence, although they remain invisible. What the\ndream substitutes for these, the \u201cmany strange people,\u201d who take no\nnotice of the spectacle which is presented, is exactly the wish-opposite\nof that single, intimate person for whom the exposure was intended.\n\u201cMany strange people,\u201d moreover, are often found in the dream in any\nother favourable connection; as a wish-opposite they always signify \u201ca\nsecret.\u201d[BV] It may be seen how the restoration of the old condition of\naffairs, as it occurs in paranoia, is subject to this antithesis. One is\nno longer alone. One is certainly being watched, but the spectators are\n\u201cmany strange, curiously indeterminate people.\u201d\nFurthermore, repression has a place in the exhibition dream. For the\ndisagreeable sensation of the dream is the reaction of the second\npsychic instance to the fact that the exhibition scene which has been\nrejected by it has in spite of this succeeded in securing\nrepresentation. The only way to avoid this sensation would be not to\nrevive the scene.\nLater on we shall again deal with the sensation of being inhibited. It\nserves the dream excellently in representing the conflict of the will,\nthe negation. According to our unconscious purpose exhibition is to be\ncontinued; according to the demands of the censor, it is to be stopped.\nThe relation of our typical dreams to fairy tales and to other poetic\nmaterial is neither a sporadic nor an accidental one. Occasionally the\nkeen insight of a poet has analytically recognised the transforming\nprocess\u2014of which the poet is usually the tool\u2014and has followed it\nbackwards, that is to say, traced it to the dream. A friend has called\nmy attention to the following passage in G. Keller\u2019s _Der Gr\u00fcne\nHeinrich_: \u201cI do not wish, dear Lee, that you should ever come to\nrealise from experience the peculiar piquant truth contained in the\nsituation of Odysseus, when he appears before Nausikaa and her\nplaymates, naked and covered with mud! Would you like to know what it\nmeans? Let us consider the incident closely. If you are ever separated\nfrom your home, and from everything that is dear to you, and wander\nabout in a strange country, when you have seen and experienced much,\nwhen you have cares and sorrows, and are, perhaps, even miserable and\nforlorn, you will some night inevitably dream that you are approaching\nyour home; you will see it shining and beaming in the most beautiful\ncolours; charming, delicate and lovely figures will come to meet you;\nand you will suddenly discover that you are going about in rags, naked\nand covered with dust. A nameless feeling of shame and fear seizes you,\nyou try to cover yourself and to hide, and you awaken bathed in sweat.\nAs long as men exist, this will be the dream of the care-laden,\nfortune-battered man, and thus Homer has taken his situation from the\nprofoundest depths of the eternal character of humanity.\u201d\nThis profound and eternal character of humanity, upon the touching of\nwhich in his listeners the poet usually calculates, is made up of the\nstirrings of the spirit which are rooted in childhood, in the period\nwhich later becomes prehistoric. Suppressed and forbidden wishes of\nchildhood break forth under cover of those wishes of the homeless man\nwhich are unobjectionable and capable of becoming conscious, and for\nthat reason the dream which is made objective in the legend of Nausikaa\nregularly assumes the form of a dream of anxiety.\nMy own dream, mentioned on p. 201, of hurrying up the stairs, which is\nsoon afterward changed into that of being glued to the steps, is\nlikewise an exhibition dream, because it shows the essential components\nof such a dream. It must thus permit of being referred to childish\nexperiences, and the possession of these ought to tell us how far the\nbehaviour of the servant girl towards me\u2014her reproach that I had soiled\nthe carpet\u2014helped her to secure the position which she occupies in the\ndream. I am now able to furnish the desired explanation. One learns in\npsychoanalysis to interpret temporal proximity by objective connection;\ntwo thoughts, apparently without connection, which immediately follow\none another, belong to a unity which can be inferred; just as an _a_ and\na _t_, which I write down together, should be pronounced as one\nsyllable, _at_. The same is true of the relation of dreams to one\nanother. The dream just cited, of the stairs, has been taken from a\nseries of dreams, whose other members I am familiar with on account of\nhaving interpreted them. The dream which is included in this series must\nbelong to the same connection. Now the other dreams of the series are\nbased upon the recollection of a nurse to whom I was entrusted from some\ntime in the period when I was suckling to the age of two and a half\nyears, and of whom a hazy recollection has remained in my consciousness.\nAccording to information which I have recently obtained from my mother,\nshe was old and ugly, but very intelligent and thorough; according to\ninferences which I may draw from my dreams, she did not always give me\nthe kindest treatment, and said hard words to me when I showed\ninsufficient aptitude for education in cleanliness. Thus by attempting\nto continue this educational work the servant girl develops a claim to\nbe treated by me, in the dream, as an incarnation of the prehistoric old\nwoman. It is to be assumed that the child bestowed his love upon this\ngoverness in spite of her bad treatment of him.[BW]\nAnother series of dreams which might be called typical are those which\nhave the content that a dear relative, parent, brother, or sister, child\nor the like, has died. Two classes of these dreams must immediately be\ndistinguished\u2014those in which the dreamer remains unaffected by sorrow\nwhile dreaming, and those in which he feels profound grief on account of\nthe death, in which he even expresses this grief during sleep by fervid\ntears.\nWe may ignore the dreams of the first group; they have no claim to be\nreckoned as typical. If they are analysed, it is found that they signify\nsomething else than what they contain, that they are intended to cover\nup some other wish. Thus it is with the dream of the aunt who sees the\nonly son of her sister lying on a bier before her (p 129). This does not\nsignify that she wishes the death of her little nephew; it only\nconceals, as we have learned, a wish to see a beloved person once more\nafter long separation\u2014the same person whom she had seen again after a\nsimilar long intermission at the funeral of another nephew. This wish,\nwhich is the real content of the dream, gives no cause for sorrow, and\nfor that reason no sorrow is felt in the dream. It may be seen in this\ncase that the emotion which is contained in the dream does not belong to\nthe manifest content of the dream, but to the latent one, and that the\nemotional content has remained free from the disfigurement which has\nbefallen the presentation content.\nIt is a different story with the dreams in which the death of a beloved\nrelative is imagined and where sorrowful emotion is felt. These signify,\nas their content says, the wish that the person in question may die, and\nas I may here expect that the feelings of all readers and of all persons\nwho have dreamt anything similar will object to my interpretation, I\nmust strive to present my proof on the broadest possible basis.\nWe have already had one example to show that the wishes represented in\nthe dream as fulfilled are not always actual wishes. They may also be\ndead, discarded, covered, and repressed wishes, which we must\nnevertheless credit with a sort of continuous existence on account of\ntheir reappearance in the dream. They are not dead like persons who have\ndied in our sense, but they resemble the shades in the _Odyssey_ which\nawaken a certain kind of life as soon as they have drunk blood. In the\ndream of the dead child in the box (p. 130) we were concerned with a\nwish that had been actual fifteen years before, and which had been\nfrankly admitted from that time. It is, perhaps, not unimportant from\nthe point of view of dream theory if I add that a recollection from\nearliest childhood is at the basis even of this dream. While the dreamer\nwas a little child\u2014it cannot be definitely determined at what time\u2014she\nhad heard that during pregnancy of which she was the fruit her mother\nhad fallen into a profound depression of spirits and had passionately\nwished for the death of her child before birth. Having grown up herself\nand become pregnant, she now follows the example of her mother.\nIf some one dreams with expressions of grief that his father or mother,\nhis brother or sister, has died, I shall not use the dream as a proof\nthat he wishes them dead _now_. The theory of the dreams does not\nrequire so much; it is satisfied with concluding that the dreamer has\nwished them dead\u2014at some one time in childhood. I fear, however, that\nthis limitation will not contribute much to quiet the objectors; they\nmight just as energetically contest the possibility that they have ever\nhad such thoughts as they are sure that they do not cherish such wishes\nat present. I must, therefore, reconstruct a part of the submerged\ninfantile psychology on the basis of the testimony which the present\nstill furnishes.[BX]\nLet us at first consider the relation of children to their brothers and\nsisters. I do not know why we presuppose that it must be a loving one,\nsince examples of brotherly and sisterly enmity among adults force\nthemselves upon every one\u2019s experience, and since we so often know that\nthis estrangement originated even during childhood or has always\nexisted. But many grown-up people, who to-day are tenderly attached to\ntheir brothers and sisters and stand by them, have lived with them\nduring childhood in almost uninterrupted hostility. The older child has\nill-treated the younger, slandered it, and deprived it of its toys; the\nyounger has been consumed by helpless fury against the elder, has envied\nit and feared it, or its first impulse toward liberty and first feelings\nof injustice have been directed against the oppressor. The parents say\nthat the children do not agree, and cannot find the reason for it. It is\nnot difficult to see that the character even of a well-behaved child is\nnot what we wish to find in a grown-up person. The child is absolutely\negotistical; it feels its wants acutely and strives remorselessly to\nsatisfy them, especially with its competitors, other children, and in\nthe first instance with its brothers and sisters. For doing this we do\nnot call the child wicked\u2014we call it naughty; it is not responsible for\nits evil deeds either in our judgment or in the eyes of the penal law.\nAnd this is justifiably so; for we may expect that within this very\nperiod of life which we call childhood, altruistic impulses and morality\nwill come to life in the little egotist, and that, in the words of\nMeynert, a secondary ego will overlay and restrain the primary one. It\nis true that morality does not develop simultaneously in all\ndepartments, and furthermore, the duration of the unmoral period of\nchildhood is of different length in different individuals. In cases\nwhere the development of this morality fails to appear, we are pleased\nto talk about \u201cdegeneration\u201d; they are obviously cases of arrested\ndevelopment. Where the primary character has already been covered up by\nlater development, it may be at least partially uncovered again by an\nattack of hysteria. The correspondence between the so-called hysterical\ncharacter and that of a naughty child is strikingly evident. A\ncompulsion neurosis, on the other hand, corresponds to a super-morality,\nimposed upon the primary character that is again asserting itself, as an\nincreased check.\nMany persons, then, who love their brothers and sisters, and who would\nfeel bereaved by their decease, have evil wishes towards them from\nearlier times in their unconscious wishes, which are capable of being\nrealised in the dream. It is particularly interesting to observe little\nchildren up to three years old in their attitude towards their brothers\nand sisters. So far the child has been the only one; he is now informed\nthat the stork has brought a new child. The younger surveys the arrival,\nand then expresses his opinion decidedly: \u201cThe stork had better take it\nback again.\u201d[BY]\nI subscribe in all seriousness to the opinion that the child knows\nenough to calculate the disadvantage it has to expect on account of the\nnew-comer. I know in the case of a lady of my acquaintance who agrees\nvery well with a sister four years younger than herself, that she\nresponded to the news of her younger sister\u2019s arrival with the following\nwords: \u201cBut I shan\u2019t give her my red cap, anyway.\u201d If the child comes to\nthis realisation only at a later time, its enmity will be aroused at\nthat point. I know of a case where a girl, not yet three years old,\ntried to strangle a suckling in the cradle, because its continued\npresence, she suspected, boded her no good. Children are capable of envy\nat this time of life in all its intensity and distinctness. Again,\nperhaps, the little brother or sister has really soon disappeared; the\nchild has again drawn the entire affection of the household to itself,\nand then a new child is sent by the stork; is it then unnatural for the\nfavourite to wish that the new competitor may have the same fate as the\nearlier one, in order that he may be treated as well as he was before\nduring the interval? Of course this attitude of the child towards the\nyounger infant is under normal circumstances a simple function of the\ndifference of age. After a certain time the maternal instincts of the\ngirl will be excited towards the helpless new-born child.\nFeelings of enmity towards brothers and sisters must occur far more\nfrequently during the age of childhood than is noted by the dull\nobservation of adults.\nIn case of my own children, who followed one another rapidly, I missed\nthe opportunity to make such observations; I am now retrieving it\nthrough my little nephew, whose complete domination was disturbed after\nfifteen months by the arrival of a female competitor. I hear, it is\ntrue, that the young man acts very chivalrously towards his little\nsister, that he kisses her hand and pets her; but in spite of this I\nhave convinced myself that even before the completion of his second year\nhe is using his new facility in language to criticise this person who\nseems superfluous to him. Whenever the conversation turns upon her, he\nchimes in and cries angrily: \u201cToo (l)ittle, too (l)ittle.\u201d During the\nlast few months, since the child has outgrown this unfavourable\ncriticism, owing to its splendid development, he has found another way\nof justifying his insistence that she does not deserve so much\nattention. On all suitable occasions he reminds us, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t any\nteeth.\u201d[BZ] We have all preserved the recollection of the eldest\ndaughter of another sister of mine\u2014how the child which was at that time\nsix years old sought assurance from one aunt after another for an hour\nand a half with the question: \u201cLucy can\u2019t understand that yet, can she?\u201d\nLucy was the competitor, two and a half years younger.\nI have never failed in any of my female patients to find this dream of\nthe death of brothers and sisters denoting exaggerated hostility. I have\nmet with only one exception, which could easily be reinterpreted into a\nconfirmation of the rule. Once in the course of a sitting while I was\nexplaining this condition of affairs to a lady, as it seemed to have a\nbearing upon the symptoms under consideration, she answered, to my\nastonishment, that she had never had such dreams. However, she thought\nof another dream which supposedly had nothing to do with the matter\u2014a\ndream which she had first dreamed at the age of four, when she was the\nyoungest child, and had since dreamed repeatedly. \u201cA great number of\nchildren, all of them the dreamer\u2019s brothers and sisters, and male and\nfemale cousins, were romping about in a meadow. Suddenly they all got\nwings, flew up, and were gone.\u201d She had no idea of the significance of\nthe dream; but it will not be difficult for us to recognise it as a\ndream of the death of all the brothers and sisters, in its original\nform, and little influenced by the censor. I venture to insert the\nfollowing interpretation: At the death of one out of a large number of\nchildren\u2014in this case the children of two brothers were brought up in\ncommon as brothers and sisters\u2014is it not probable that our dreamer, at\nthat time not yet four years old, asked a wise, grown-up person: \u201cWhat\nbecomes of children when they are dead?\u201d The answer probably was: \u201cThey\nget wings and become angels.\u201d According to this explanation all the\nbrothers and sisters and cousins in the dream now have wings like angels\nand\u2014this is the important thing\u2014they fly away. Our little angel-maker\nremains alone, think of it, the only one after such a multitude! The\nfeature that the children are romping about on a meadow points with\nlittle ambiguity to butterflies, as though the child had been led by the\nsame association which induced the ancients to conceive Psyche as having\nthe wings of a butterfly.\nPerhaps some one will now object that, although the inimical impulses of\nchildren towards their brothers and sisters may well enough be admitted,\nhow does the childish disposition arrive at such a height of wickedness\nas to wish death to a competitor or stronger playmate, as though all\ntransgressions could be atoned for only by the death-punishment? Whoever\ntalks in this manner forgets that the childish idea of \u201cbeing dead\u201d has\nlittle else but the words in common with our own. The child knows\nnothing of the horrors of decay, of shivering in the cold grave, of the\nterror of the infinite Nothing, which the grown-up person, as all the\nmyths concerning the Great Beyond testify, finds it so hard to bear in\nhis conception. Fear of death is strange to the child; therefore it\nplays with the horrible word and threatens another child: \u201cIf you do\nthat again you will die, as Francis died,\u201d whereat the poor mother\nshudders, for perhaps she cannot forget that the great majority of\nmortals do not succeed in living beyond the years of childhood. It is\nstill possible, even for a child eight years old, on returning from a\nmuseum of natural history, to say to its mother: \u201cMamma, I love you so;\nif you ever die, I am going to have you stuffed and set you up here in\nthe room so I can always, always see you!\u201d So little does the childish\nconception of being dead resemble our own.[CA]\nBeing dead means for the child, which has been spared the scenes of\nsuffering previous to dying, the same as \u201cbeing gone,\u201d not disturbing\nthe survivors any more. The child does not distinguish the manner and\nmeans by which this absence is brought about, whether by travelling,\nestrangement, or death. If, during the prehistoric years of a child, a\nnurse has been sent away and its mother has died a short while after,\nthe two experiences, as is revealed by analysis, overlap in his memory.\nThe fact that the child does not miss very intensely those who are\nabsent has been realised by many a mother to her sorrow, after she has\nreturned home after a summer journey of several weeks, and has been told\nupon inquiry: \u201cThe children have not asked for their mother a single\ntime.\u201d But if she really goes to that \u201cundiscovered country from whose\nbourn no traveller returns,\u201d the children seem at first to have\nforgotten her, and begin only _subsequently_ to remember the dead\nmother.\nIf, then, the child has motives for wishing the absence of another\nchild, every restraint is lacking which would prevent it from clothing\nthis wish in the form that the child may die, and the psychic reaction\nto the dream of wishing death proves that, in spite of all the\ndifferences in content, the wish in the case of the child is somehow or\nother the same as it is with adults.\nIf now the death-wish of the child towards its brothers and sisters has\nbeen explained by the childish egotism, which causes the child to regard\nits brothers and sisters as competitors, how may we account for the same\nwish towards parents, who bestow love on the child and satisfy its\nwants, and whose preservation it ought to desire from these very\negotistical motives?\nIn the solution of this difficulty we are aided by the experience that\ndreams of the death of parents predominantly refer to that member of the\nparental couple which shares the sex of the dreamer, so that the man\nmostly dreams of the death of his father, the woman of the death of her\nmother. I cannot claim that this happens regularly, but the\npredominating occurrence of this dream in the manner indicated is so\nevident that it must be explained through some factor that is\nuniversally operative. To express the matter boldly, it is as though a\nsexual preference becomes active at an early period, as though the boy\nregards his father as a rival in love, and as though the girl takes the\nsame attitude toward her mother\u2014a rival by getting rid of whom he or she\ncannot but profit.\nBefore rejecting this idea as monstrous, let the reader consider the\nactual relations between parents and children. What the requirements of\nculture and piety demand of this relation must be distinguished from\nwhat daily observation shows us to be the fact. More than one cause for\nhostile feeling is concealed within the relations between parents and\nchildren; the conditions necessary for the actuation of wishes which\ncannot exist in the presence of the censor are most abundantly provided.\nLet us dwell at first upon the relation between father and son. I\nbelieve that the sanctity which we have ascribed to the injunction of\nthe decalogue dulls our perception of reality. Perhaps we hardly dare to\nnotice that the greater part of humanity neglects to obey the fifth\ncommandment. In the lowest as well as in the highest strata of human\nsociety, piety towards parents is in the habit of receding before other\ninterests. The obscure reports which have come to us in mythology and\nlegend from the primeval ages of human society give us an unpleasant\nidea of the power of the father and the ruthlessness with which it was\nused. Kronos devours his children, as the wild boar devours the brood of\nthe sow; Zeus emasculates his father[CB] and takes his place as a ruler.\nThe more despotically the father ruled in the ancient family, the more\nmust the son have taken the position of an enemy, and the greater must\nhave been his impatience, as designated successor, to obtain the mastery\nhimself after his father\u2019s death. Even in our own middle-class family\nthe father is accustomed to aid the development of the germ of hatred\nwhich naturally belongs to the paternal relation by refusing the son the\ndisposal of his own destiny, or the means necessary for this. A\nphysician often has occasion to notice that the son\u2019s grief at the loss\nof his father cannot suppress his satisfaction at the liberty which he\nhas at last obtained. Every father frantically holds on to whatever of\nthe sadly antiquated _potestas patris_ still remains in the society of\nto-day, and every poet who, like Ibsen, puts the ancient strife between\nfather and son in the foreground of his fiction is sure of his effect.\nThe causes of conflict between mother and daughter arise when the\ndaughter grows up and finds a guardian in her mother, while she desires\nsexual freedom, and when, on the other hand, the mother has been warned\nby the budding beauty of her daughter that the time has come for her to\nrenounce sexual claims.\nAll these conditions are notorious and open to everyone\u2019s inspection.\nBut they do not serve to explain dreams of the death of parents found in\nthe case of persons to whom piety towards their parents has long since\ncome to be inviolable. We are furthermore prepared by the preceding\ndiscussion to find that the death-wish towards parents is to be\nexplained by reference to earliest childhood.\nThis conjecture is reaffirmed with a certainty that makes doubt\nimpossible in its application to psychoneurotics through the analyses\nthat have been undertaken with them. It is here found that the sexual\nwishes of the child\u2014in so far as they deserve this designation in their\nembryonic state\u2014awaken at a very early period, and that the first\ninclinations of the girl are directed towards the father, and the first\nchildish cravings of the boy towards the mother. The father thus becomes\nan annoying competitor for the boy, as the mother does for the girl, and\nwe have already shown in the case of brothers and sisters how little it\ntakes for this feeling to lead the child to the death-wish. Sexual\nselection, as a rule, early becomes evident in the parents; it is a\nnatural tendency for the father to indulge the little daughter, and for\nthe mother to take the part of the sons, while both work earnestly for\nthe education of the little ones when the magic of sex does not\nprejudice their judgment. The child is very well aware of any\npartiality, and resists that member of the parental couple who\ndiscourages it. To find love in a grown-up person is for the child not\nonly the satisfaction of a particular craving, but also means that the\nchild\u2019s will is to be yielded to in other respects. Thus the child obeys\nits own sexual impulse, and at the same time re-enforces the feeling\nwhich proceeds from the parents, if it makes a selection among the\nparents that corresponds to theirs.\nMost of the signs of these infantile inclinations are usually\noverlooked; some of them may be observed even after the first years of\nchildhood. An eight-year-old girl of my acquaintance, when her mother is\ncalled from the table, takes advantage of the opportunity to proclaim\nherself her successor. \u201cNow I shall be Mamma; Charles, do you want some\nmore vegetables? Have some, I beg you,\u201d &c. A particularly gifted and\nvivacious girl, not yet four years old, with whom this bit of child\npsychology is unusually transparent, says outright: \u201cNow mother can go\naway; then father must marry me and I shall be his wife.\u201d Nor does this\nwish by any means exclude from child life the possibility that the child\nmay love his mother affectionately. If the little boy is allowed to\nsleep at his mother\u2019s side whenever his father goes on a journey, and if\nafter his father\u2019s return he must go back to the nursery to a person\nwhom he likes far less, the wish may be easily actuated that his father\nmay always be absent, in order that he may keep his place next to his\ndear, beautiful mamma; and the father\u2019s death is obviously a means for\nthe attainment of this wish; for the child\u2019s experience has taught him\nthat \u201cdead\u201d folks, like grandpa, for example, are always absent; they\nnever return.\nAlthough observations upon little children lend themselves, without\nbeing forced, to the proposed interpretation, they do not carry the full\nconviction which psychoanalyses of adult neurotics obtrude upon the\nphysician. The dreams in question are here cited with introductions of\nsuch a nature that their interpretation as wish-dreams becomes\nunavoidable. One day I find a lady sad and weeping. She says: \u201cI do not\nwant to see my relatives any more; they must shudder at me.\u201d Thereupon,\nalmost without any transition, she tells that she remembers a dream,\nwhose significance, of course, she does not know. She dreamed it four\nyears before, and it is as follows: _A fox or a lynx is taking a walk on\nthe roof; then something falls down, or she falls down, and after that\nher mother is carried out of the house dead_\u2014whereat the dreamer cries\nbitterly. No sooner had I informed her that this dream must signify a\nwish from her childhood to see her mother dead, and that it is because\nof this dream that she thinks that her relatives must shudder at her,\nthan she furnished some material for explaining the dream. \u201cLynx-eye\u201d is\nan opprobrious epithet which a street boy once bestowed on her when she\nwas a very small child; when she was three years old a brick had fallen\non her mother\u2019s head so that she bled severely.\nI once had opportunity to make a thorough study of a young girl who\nunderwent several psychic states. In the state of frenzied excitement\nwith which the illness started, the patient showed a very strong\naversion to her mother; she struck and scolded her as soon as she\napproached the bed, while at the same time she remained loving and\nobedient to a much older sister. Then there followed a clear but\nsomewhat apathetic state with very much disturbed sleep. It was in this\nphase that I began to treat her and to analyse her dreams. An enormous\nnumber of these dealt in a more or less abstruse manner with the death\nof the mother; now she was present at the funeral of an old woman, now\nshe saw her sisters sitting at the table dressed in mourning; the\nmeaning of the dreams could not be doubted. During the further progress\nof the convalescence hysterical phobias appeared; the most torturing of\nthese was the idea that something happened to her mother. She was always\nhaving to hurry home from wherever she happened to be in order to\nconvince herself that her mother was still alive. Now this case, in view\nof my other experiences, was very instructive; it showed in polyglot\ntranslations, as it were, the different ways in which the psychic\napparatus reacts to the same exciting idea. In the state of excitement\nwhich I conceive as the overpowering of the second psychic instance, the\nunconscious enmity towards the mother became potent as a motor impulse;\nthen, after calmness set in, following the suppression of the tumult,\nand after the domination of the censor had been restored, this feeling\nof enmity had access only to the province of dreams in order to realise\nthe wish that the mother might die; and after the normal condition had\nbeen still further strengthened, it created the excessive concern for\nthe mother as a hysterical counter-reaction and manifestation of\ndefence. In the light of these considerations it is no longer\ninexplicable why hysterical girls are so often extravagantly attached to\ntheir mothers.\nOn another occasion I had opportunity to get a profound insight into the\nunconscious psychic life of a young man for whom a compulsion-neurosis\nmade life almost unendurable, so that he could not go on the street,\nbecause he was harassed by the obsession that he would kill every one he\nmet. He spent his days in arranging evidence for an alibi in case he\nshould be charged with any murder that might have occurred in the city.\nIt is superfluous to remark that this man was as moral as he was highly\ncultured. The analysis\u2014which, moreover, led to a cure\u2014discovered\nmurderous impulses toward the young man\u2019s somewhat over-strict father as\nthe basis of these disagreeable ideas of compulsion\u2014impulses which, to\nhis great surprise, had received conscious expression when he was seven\nyears old, but which, of course, had originated in much earlier years of\nchildhood. After the painful illness and death of the father, the\nobsessive reproach transferred to strangers in the form of the\nafore-mentioned phobia, appeared when the young man was thirty-one years\nold. Anyone capable of wishing to push his own father from a\nmountain-top into an abyss is certainly not to be trusted to spare the\nlives of those who are not so closely bound to him; he does well to lock\nhimself into his room.\nAccording to my experience, which is now large, parents play a leading\npart in the infantile psychology of all later neurotics, and falling in\nlove with one member of the parental couple and hatred of the other help\nto make up that fateful sum of material furnished by the psychic\nimpulses, which has been formed during the infantile period, and which\nis of such great importance for the symptoms appearing in the later\nneurosis. But I do not think that psychoneurotics are here sharply\ndistinguished from normal human beings, in that they are capable of\ncreating something absolutely new and peculiar to themselves. It is far\nmore probable, as is shown also by occasional observation upon normal\nchildren, that in their loving or hostile wishes towards their parents\npsychoneurotics only show in exaggerated form feelings which are present\nless distinctly and less intensely in the minds of most children.\nAntiquity has furnished us with legendary material to confirm this fact,\nand the deep and universal effectiveness of these legends can only be\nexplained by granting a similar universal applicability to the\nabove-mentioned assumption in infantile psychology.\nI refer to the legend of King Oedipus and the drama of the same name by\nSophocles. Oedipus, the son of Laius, king of Thebes, and of Jocasta, is\nexposed while a suckling, because an oracle has informed the father that\nhis son, who is still unborn, will be his murderer. He is rescued, and\ngrows up as the king\u2019s son at a foreign court, until, being uncertain\nabout his origin, he also consults the oracle, and is advised to avoid\nhis native place, for he is destined to become the murderer of his\nfather and the husband of his mother. On the road leading away from his\nsupposed home he meets King Laius and strikes him dead in a sudden\nquarrel. Then he comes to the gates of Thebes, where he solves the\nriddle of the Sphynx who is barring the way, and he is elected king by\nthe Thebans in gratitude, and is presented with the hand of Jocasta. He\nreigns in peace and honour for a long time, and begets two sons and two\ndaughters upon his unknown mother, until at last a plague breaks out\nwhich causes the Thebans to consult the oracle anew. Here Sophocles\u2019\ntragedy begins. The messengers bring the advice that the plague will\nstop as soon as the murderer of Laius is driven from the country. But\nwhere is he hidden?\n\u201cWhere are they to be found? How shall we trace the perpetrators of so\nold a crime where no conjecture leads to discovery?\u201d[CC]\nThe action of the play now consists merely in a revelation, which is\ngradually completed and artfully delayed\u2014resembling the work of a\npsychoanalysis\u2014of the fact that Oedipus himself is the murderer of\nLaius, and the son of the dead man and of Jocasta. Oedipus, profoundly\nshocked at the monstrosities which he has unknowingly committed, blinds\nhimself and leaves his native place. The oracle has been fulfilled.\nThe _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is a so-called tragedy of fate; its tragic effect\nis said to be found in the opposition between the powerful will of the\ngods and the vain resistance of the human beings who are threatened with\ndestruction; resignation to the will of God and confession of one\u2019s own\nhelplessness is the lesson which the deeply-moved spectator is to learn\nfrom the tragedy. Consequently modern authors have tried to obtain a\nsimilar tragic effect by embodying the same opposition in a story of\ntheir own invention. But spectators have sat unmoved while a curse or an\noracular sentence has been fulfilled on blameless human beings in spite\nof all their struggles; later tragedies of fate have all remained\nwithout effect.\nIf the _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is capable of moving modern men no less than\nit moved the contemporary Greeks, the explanation of this fact cannot\nlie merely in the assumption that the effect of the Greek tragedy is\nbased upon the opposition between fate and human will, but is to be\nsought in the peculiar nature of the material by which the opposition is\nshown. There must be a voice within us which is prepared to recognise\nthe compelling power of fate in _Oedipus_, while we justly condemn the\nsituations occurring in _Die Ahnfrau_ or in other tragedies of later\ndate as arbitrary inventions. And there must be a factor corresponding\nto this inner voice in the story of King Oedipus. His fate moves us only\nfor the reason that it might have been ours, for the oracle has put the\nsame curse upon us before our birth as upon him. Perhaps we are all\ndestined to direct our first sexual impulses towards our mothers, and\nour first hatred and violent washes towards our fathers; our dreams\nconvince us of it. King Oedipus, who has struck his father Laius dead\nand has married his mother Jocasta, is nothing but the realised wish of\nour childhood. But more fortunate than he, we have since succeeded,\nunless we have become psychoneurotics, in withdrawing our sexual\nimpulses from our mothers and in forgetting our jealousy of our fathers.\nWe recoil from the person for whom this primitive wish has been\nfulfilled with all the force of the repression which these wishes have\nsuffered within us. By his analysis, showing us the guilt of Oedipus,\nthe poet urges us to recognise our own inner self, in which these\nimpulses, even if suppressed, are still present. The comparison with\nwhich the chorus leaves us\u2014\n\u201c... Behold! this Oedipus, who unravelled the famous riddle and who\nwas a man of eminent virtue; a man who trusted neither to popularity\nnor to the fortune of his citizens; see how great a storm of adversity\nhath at last overtaken him\u201d (Act v. sc. 4).\nThis warning applies to ourselves and to our pride, to us, who have\ngrown so wise and so powerful in our own estimation since the years of\nour childhood. Like Oedipus, we live in ignorance of the wishes that\noffend morality, wishes which nature has forced upon us, and after the\nrevelation of which we want to avert every glance from the scenes of our\nchildhood.\nIn the very text of Sophocles\u2019 tragedy there is an unmistakable\nreference to the fact that the Oedipus legend originates in an extremely\nold dream material, which consists of the painful disturbance of the\nrelation towards one\u2019s parents by means of the first impulses of\nsexuality. Jocasta comforts Oedipus\u2014who is not yet enlightened, but who\nhas become worried on account of the oracle\u2014by mentioning to him the\ndream which is dreamt by so many people, though she attaches no\nsignificance to it\u2014\n\u201cFor it hath already been the lot of many men in dreams to think\nthemselves partners of their mother\u2019s bed. But he passes most easily\nthrough life to whom these circumstances are trifles\u201d (Act iv. sc. 3).\nThe dream of having sexual intercourse with one\u2019s mother occurred at\nthat time, as it does to-day, to many people, who tell it with\nindignation and astonishment. As may be understood, it is the key to the\ntragedy and the complement to the dream of the death of the father. The\nstory of Oedipus is the reaction of the imagination to these two typical\ndreams, and just as the dream when occurring to an adult is experienced\nwith feelings of resistance, so the legend must contain terror and\nself-chastisement. The appearance which it further assumes is the result\nof an uncomprehending secondary elaboration which tries to make it serve\ntheological purposes (_cf._ the dream material of exhibitionism, p.\n206). The attempt to reconcile divine omnipotence with human\nresponsibility must, of course, fail with this material as with every\nother.[CD]\nI must not leave the typical dream of the death of dear relatives\nwithout somewhat further elucidating the subject of their significance\nfor the theory of the dream in general. These dreams show us a\nrealisation of the very unusual case where the dream thought, which has\nbeen created by the repressed wish, completely escapes the censor, and\nis transferred to the dream without alteration. There must be present\npeculiar conditions making possible such an outcome. I find\ncircumstances favourable to these dreams in the two following factors:\nFirst, there is no wish which we believe further from us; we believe\nsuch a wish \u201cwould never occur to us in a dream\u201d; the dream censor is\ntherefore not prepared for this monstrosity, just as the legislation of\nSolon was incapable of establishing a punishment for patricide.\nSecondly, the repressed and unsuspected wish is in just this case\nparticularly often met by a fragment of the day\u2019s experience in the\nshape of a concern about the life of the beloved person. This concern\ncannot be registered in the dream by any other means than by taking\nadvantage of the wish that has the same content; but it is possible for\nthe wish to mask itself behind the concern which has been awakened\nduring the day. If one is inclined to think all this a more simple\nprocess, and that one merely continues during the night and in dreams\nwhat one has been concerned with during the day, the dream of the death\nof beloved persons is removed from all connection with dream\nexplanation, and an easily reducible problem is uselessly retained.\nIt is also instructive to trace the relation of these dreams to anxiety\ndreams. In the dream of the death of dear persons the repressed wish has\nfound a way of avoiding the censor, and the distortion which it causes.\nIn this case the inevitable concomitant manifestation is that\ndisagreeable sensations are felt in the dream. Thus the dream of fear is\nbrought about only when the censor is entirely or partially overpowered,\nand, on the other hand, the overpowering of the censor is made easier\nwhen fear has already been furnished by somatic sources. Thus it becomes\nobvious for what purpose the censor performs its office and practises\ndream distortion; it does this _in order to prevent the development of\nfear or other forms of disagreeable emotion_.\nI have spoken above of the egotism of the infantile mind, and I may now\nresume this subject in order to suggest that dreams preserve this\ncharacteristic\u2014thus showing their connection with infantile life. Every\ndream is absolutely egotistical; in every dream the beloved ego appears,\neven though it may be in a disguised form. The wishes that are realised\nin dreams are regularly the wishes of this ego; it is only a deceptive\nappearance if interest in another person is thought to have caused the\ndream. I shall subject to analysis several examples which appear to\ncontradict this assertion.\nI. A boy not yet four years old relates the following: _He saw a large\ndish garnished, and upon it a large piece of roast meat, and the meat\nwas all of a sudden\u2014not cut to pieces\u2014but eaten up. He did not see the\nperson who ate it._[CE]\nWho may this strange person be of whose luxurious repast this little\nfellow dreams? The experiences of the day must give us the explanation\nof this. For a few days the boy had been living on a diet of milk\naccording to the doctor\u2019s prescription; but on the evening of the day\nbefore the dream he had been naughty, and as a punishment he had been\ndeprived of his evening meal. He had already undergone one such\nhunger-cure, and had acted very bravely. He knew that he would get\nnothing to eat, but he did not dare to indicate by a word that he was\nhungry. Education was beginning to have its influence upon him; this is\nexpressed even in the dream which shows the beginnings of dream\ndisfigurement. There is no doubt that he himself is the person whose\nwishes are directed toward this abundant meal, and a meal of roast meat\nat that. But since he knows that this is forbidden him, he does not\ndare, as children do in the dream (_cf._ the dream about strawberries of\nmy little Anna, p. 110), to sit down to the meal himself. The person\nremains anonymous.\nII. Once I dream that I see on the show-table of a book store a new\nnumber in the Book-lovers\u2019 Collection\u2014the collection which I am in the\nhabit of buying (art monographs, monographs on the history of the world,\nfamous art centres, &c.). _The new collection is called Famous Orators\n(or Orations), and the first number bears the name of Doctor Lecher._\nIn the course of analysis it appears improbable that the fame of Dr.\nLecher, the long-winded orator of the German Opposition, should occupy\nmy thoughts while I am dreaming. The fact is that, a few days before, I\nundertook the psychic cure of some new patients, and was now forced to\ntalk for from ten to twelve hours a day. Thus I myself am the\nlong-winded orator.\nIII. Upon another occasion I dream that a teacher of my acquaintance at\nthe university says: _My son, the Myopic_. Then there follows a dialogue\nconsisting of short speeches and replies. A third portion of the dream\nfollows in which I and my sons appear, and as far as the latent dream\ncontent is concerned, father, son, and Professor M. are alike only lay\nfigures to represent me and my eldest son. I shall consider this dream\nagain further on because of another peculiarity.\nIV. The following dream gives an example of really base egotistical\nfeelings, which are concealed behind affectionate concern:\n_My friend Otto looks ill, his face is brown and his eyes bulge._\nOtto is my family physician, to whom I owe a debt greater than I can\never hope to repay, since he has guarded the health of my children for\nyears. He has treated them successfully when they were taken sick, and\nbesides that he has given them presents on all occasions which gave him\nany excuse for doing so. He came for a visit on the day of the dream,\nand my wife noticed that he looked tired and exhausted. Then comes my\ndream at night, and attributes to him a few of the symptoms of Basedow\u2019s\ndisease. Any one disregarding my rules for dream interpretation would\nunderstand this dream to mean that I am concerned about the health of my\nfriend, and that this concern is realised in the dream. It would thus be\na contradiction not only of the assertion that the dream is a\nwish-fulfilment, but also of the assertion that it is accessible only to\negotistic impulses. But let the person who interprets the dream in this\nmanner explain to me why I fear that Otto has Basedow\u2019s disease, for\nwhich diagnosis his appearance does not give the slightest\njustification? As opposed to this, my analysis furnishes the following\nmaterial, taken from an occurrence which happened six years ago. A small\nparty of us, including Professor R., were driving in profound darkness\nthrough the forest of N., which is several hours distant from our\ncountry home. The coachman, who was not quite sober, threw us and the\nwagon down a bank, and it was only by a lucky accident that we all\nescaped unhurt. But we were forced to spend the night at the nearest\ninn, where the news of our accident awakened great sympathy. A\ngentleman, who showed unmistakable signs of the morbus Basedowii\u2014nothing\nbut a brownish colour of the skin of the face and bulging eyes, no\ngoitre\u2014placed himself entirely at our disposal and asked what he could\ndo for us. Professor R. answered in his decided way: \u201cNothing but lend\nme a night-shirt.\u201d Whereupon our generous friend replied: \u201cI am sorry\nbut I cannot do that,\u201d and went away.\nIn continuing the analysis, it occurs to me that Basedow is the name not\nonly of a physician, but also of a famous educator. (Now that I am awake\nI do not feel quite sure of this fact.) My friend Otto is the person\nwhom I have asked to take charge of the physical education of my\nchildren\u2014especially during the age of puberty (hence the night-shirt)\u2014in\ncase anything should happen to me. By seeing Otto in the dream with the\nmorbid symptoms of our above-mentioned generous benefactor, I apparently\nmean to say, \u201cIf anything happens to me, just as little is to be\nexpected for my children from him as was to be expected then from Baron\nL., in spite of his well-meaning offers.\u201d The egotistical turn of this\ndream ought now to be clear.[CF]\nBut where is the wish-fulfilment to be found? It is not in the vengeance\nsecured upon my friend Otto, whose fate it seems to be to receive\nill-treatment in my dreams, but in the following circumstances: In\nrepresenting Otto in the dream as Baron L., I have at the same time\nidentified myself with some one else, that is to say, with Professor R.,\nfor I have asked something of Otto, just as R. asked something of Baron\nL. at the time of the occurrence which has been mentioned. And that is\nthe point. For Professor R. has pursued his way independently outside\nthe schools, somewhat as I have done, and has only in later years\nreceived the title which he earned long ago. I am therefore again\nwishing to be a professor! The very phrase \u201cin later years\u201d is the\nfulfilment of wish, for it signifies that I shall live long enough to\npilot my boy through the age of puberty myself.\nI gave only a brief account of the other forms of typical dreams in the\nfirst edition of this book, because an insufficient amount of good\nmaterial was at my disposal. My experience, which has since been\nincreased, now makes it possible for me to divide these dreams into two\nbroad classes\u2014first, those which really have the same meaning every\ntime, and secondly, those which must be subjected to the most widely\ndifferent interpretations in spite of their identical or similar\ncontent. Among the typical dreams of the first sort I shall closely\nconsider the examination dream and the so-called dream of dental\nirritation.\nEvery one who has received his degree after having passed the final\ncollege examination, complains of the ruthlessness with which he is\npursued by the anxiety dream that he will fail, that he must repeat his\nwork, &c. For the holder of the university degree this typical dream is\nreplaced by another, which represents to him that he has to pass the\nexamination for the doctor\u2019s degree, and against which he vainly raises\nthe objection in his sleep that he has already been practising for\nyears\u2014that he is already a university instructor or the head of a law\nfirm. These are the ineradicable memories of the punishments which we\nsuffered when we were children for misdeeds which we had\ncommitted\u2014memories which were revived in us on that _dies irae, dies\nilla_ of the severe examination at the two critical junctures in our\nstudies. The \u201cexamination-phobia\u201d of neurotics is also strengthened by\nthis childish fear. After we have ceased to be schoolboys it is no\nlonger our parents and guardians as at first, or our teachers as later\non, who see to our punishment; the inexorable chain of causes and\neffects in life has taken over our further education. Now we dream of\nexaminations for graduation or for the doctor\u2019s degree\u2014and who has not\nbeen faint-hearted in these tests, even though he belonged to the\nrighteous?\u2014whenever we fear that an outcome will punish us because we\nhave not done something, or because we have not accomplished something\nas we should\u2014in short whenever we feel the weight of responsibility.\nI owe the actual explanation of examination dreams to a remark made by a\nwell-informed colleague, who once asserted in a scientific discussion\nthat in his experience the examination dream occurs only to persons who\nhave passed the examination, never to those who have gone to pieces on\nit. The anxiety dream of the examination, which occurs, as is being more\nand more corroborated, when the dreamer is looking forward to a\nresponsible action on his part the next day and the possibility of\ndisgrace, has therefore probably selected an occasion in the past where\nthe great anxiety has shown itself to have been without justification\nand has been contradicted by the result. This would be a very striking\nexample of a misconception of the dream content on the part of the\nwaking instance. The objection to the dream, which is conceived as the\nindignant protest, \u201cBut I am already a doctor,\u201d &c., would be in reality\na consolation which the dreams offer, and which would therefore be to\nthe following effect: \u201cDo not be afraid of the morrow; think of the fear\nwhich you had before the final examination, and yet nothing came of it.\nYou are a doctor this minute,\u201d &c. The fear, however, which we attribute\nto the dream, originates in the remnants of daily experience.\nThe tests of this explanation which I was able to make in my own case\nand in that of others, although they were not sufficiently numerous,\nhave been altogether successful. I failed, for example, in the\nexamination for the doctor\u2019s degree in legal medicine; never once have I\nbeen concerned about this matter in my dreams, while I have often enough\nbeen examined in botany, zoology, or chemistry, in which subjects I took\nthe examinations with well-founded anxiety, but escaped punishment\nthrough the clemency of fortune or of the examiner. In my dreams of\ncollege examination, I am regularly examined in history, a subject which\nI passed brilliantly at the time, but only, I must admit, because my\ngood-natured professor\u2014my one-eyed benefactor in another dream (_cf._ p.\n12)\u2014did not overlook the fact that on the list of questions I had\ncrossed out the second of three questions as an indication that he\nshould not insist on it. One of my patients, who withdrew before the\nfinal college examinations and made them up later, but who failed in the\nofficer\u2019s examination and did not become an officer, tells me that he\ndreams about the former examination often enough, but never about the\nlatter.\nThe above-mentioned colleague (Dr. Stekel of Vienna) calls attention to\nthe double meaning of the word \u201cMatura\u201d (_Matura_\u2014examination for\ncollege degree: mature, ripe), and claims that he has observed that\nexamination dreams occur very frequently when a sexual test is set for\nthe following day, in which, therefore, the disgrace which is feared\nmight consist in the manifestation of slight potency. A German colleague\ntakes exception to this, as it appears, justly, on the ground that this\nexamination is denominated in Germany the Abiturium and hence lacks this\ndouble meaning.\nOn account of their similar affective impression dreams of missing a\ntrain deserve to be placed next to examination dreams. Their explanation\nalso justifies this relationship. They are consolation dreams directed\nagainst another feeling of fear perceived in the dream, the fear of\ndying. \u201cTo depart\u201d is one of the most frequent and one of the most\neasily reached symbols of death. The dream thus says consolingly:\n\u201cCompose yourself, you are not going to die (to depart),\u201d just as the\nexamination dream calms us by saying \u201cFear not, nothing will happen to\nyou even this time.\u201d The difficulty in understanding both kinds of\ndreams is due to the fact that the feeling of anxiety is directly\nconnected with the expression of consolation. Stekel treats fully the\nsymbolisms of death in his recently published book _Die Sprache des\nTraumes_.\nThe meaning of the \u201cdreams of dental irritation,\u201d which I have had to\nanalyse often enough with my patients, escaped me for a long time,\nbecause, much to my astonishment, resistances that were altogether too\ngreat obstructed their interpretation.\nAt last overwhelming evidence convinced me that, in the case of men,\nnothing else than cravings for masturbation from the time of puberty\nfurnishes the motive power for these dreams. I shall analyse two such\ndreams, one of which is likewise \u201ca dream of flight.\u201d The two dreams are\nof the same person\u2014a young man with a strong homosexuality, which,\nhowever, has been repressed in life.\n_He is witnessing a performance of_ Fidelio _from the parquette of the\nopera house; he is sitting next to L., whose personality is congenial to\nhim, and whose friendship he would like to have. He suddenly flies\ndiagonally clear across the parquette; he then puts his hand in his\nmouth and draws out two of his teeth._\nHe himself describes the flight by saying it was as if he were \u201cthrown\u201d\ninto the air. As it was a performance of _Fidelio_ he recalls the poet\u2019s\nwords:\n\u201cHe who a charming wife acquired\u2014\u2014\u201d\nBut even the acquisition of a charming wife is not among the wishes of\nthe dreamer. Two other verses would be more appropriate:\n_\u201cHe who succeeds in the lucky (big) throw,\nA friend of a friend to be....\u201d_\nThe dream thus contains the \u201clucky (big) throw,\u201d which is not, however,\na wish-fulfilment only. It also conceals the painful reflection that in\nhis striving after friendship he has often had the misfortune to be\n\u201cthrown down,\u201d and the fear lest this fate may be repeated in the case\nof the young man next whom he has enjoyed the performance of _Fidelio_.\nThis is now followed by a confession which quite puts this refined\ndreamer to shame, to the effect that once, after such a rejection on the\npart of a friend, out of burning desire he merged into sexual excitement\nand masturbated twice in succession.\nThe other dream is as follows: _Two professors of the university who are\nknown to him are treating him in my stead. One of them does something\nwith his penis; he fears an operation. The other one thrusts an iron bar\nat his mouth so that he loses two teeth. He is bound with four silken\ncloths._\nThe sexual significance of this dream can hardly be doubted. The silken\ncloths are equivalent to an identification with a homosexual of his\nacquaintance. The dreamer, who has never achieved coition, but who has\nnever actually sought sexual intercourse with men, conceives sexual\nintercourse after the model of the masturbation which he was once taught\nduring the time of puberty.\nI believe that the frequent modifications of the typical dream of dental\nirritation\u2014that, for example, of another person drawing the tooth from\nthe dreamer\u2019s mouth, are made intelligible by means of the same\nexplanation. It may, however, be difficult to see how \u201cdental\nirritation\u201d can come to have this significance. I may then call\nattention to a transference from below to above which occurs very\nfrequently. This transference is at the service of sexual repression,\nand by means of it all kinds of sensations and intentions occurring in\nhysteria which ought to be enacted in the genitals can be realised upon\nless objectionable parts of the body. It is also a case of such\ntransference when the genitals are replaced by the face in the symbolism\nof unconscious thought. This is assisted by the fact that the buttocks\nresemble the cheeks, and also by the usage of language which calls the\nnymph\u00e6 \u201clips,\u201d as resembling those that enclose the opening of the\nmouth. The nose is compared to the penis in numerous allusions, and in\none place as in the other the presence of hair completes the\nresemblance. Only one part of the anatomy\u2014the teeth\u2014are beyond all\npossibility of being compared with anything, and it is just this\ncoincidence of agreement and disagreement which makes the teeth suitable\nfor representation under pressure of sexual repression.\nI do not wish to claim that the interpretation of the dream of dental\nirritation as a dream of masturbation, the justification of which I\ncannot doubt, has been freed of all obscurity.[CG] I carry the\nexplanation as far as I am able, and must leave the rest unsolved. But I\nmust also refer to another connection revealed by an idiomatic\nexpression. In our country there is in use an indelicate designation for\nthe act of masturbation, namely: To pull one out, or to pull one\ndown.[CH] I am unable to say whence these colloquialisms originate, and\non what symbolisms they are based, but the teeth would well fit in with\nthe first of the two.[CI]\nDreams in which one is flying or hovering, falling, swimming, or the\nlike, belong to the second group of typical dreams. What do these dreams\nsignify? A general statement on this point cannot be made. They signify\nsomething different in each case, as we shall hear: only the sensational\nmaterial which they contain always comes from the same source.\nIt is necessary to conclude, from the material obtained in\npsychoanalysis, that these dreams repeat impressions from childhood\u2014that\nis, that they refer to the movement games which have such extraordinary\nattractions for the child. What uncle has never made a child fly by\nrunning across the room with it with arms outstretched, or has never\nplayed falling with it by rocking it on his knee and then suddenly\nstretching out his leg, or by lifting it up high and then pretending to\nwithdraw support. At this the children shout with joy, and demand more\nuntiringly, especially if there is a little fright and dizziness\nattached to it; in after years they create a repetition of this in the\ndream, but in the dream they omit the hands which have held them, so\nthat they now freely float and fall. The fondness of all small children\nfor games like rocking and see-sawing is well known; and if they see\ngymnastic tricks at the circus their recollection of this rocking is\nrefreshed. With some boys the hysterical attack consists simply in the\nreproduction of such tricks, which they accomplish with great skill. Not\ninfrequently sexual sensations are excited by these movement games,\nharmless as they are in themselves.[CJ] To express the idea by a word\nwhich is current among us, and which covers all of these matters: It is\nthe wild playing (\u201cHetzen\u201d) of childhood which dreams about flying,\nfalling, vertigo, and the like repeat, and the voluptuous feelings of\nwhich have now been turned into fear. But as every mother knows, the\nwild playing of children has often enough culminated in quarrelling and\ntears.\nI therefore have good reason for rejecting the explanation that the\ncondition of our dermal sensations during sleep, the sensations caused\nby the movements of the lungs, and the like, give rise to dreams of\nflying and falling. I see that these very sensations have been\nreproduced from the memory with which the dream is concerned\u2014that they\nare, therefore, a part of the dream content and not of the dream\nsources.\nThis material, similar in its character and origin consisting of\nsensations of motion, is now used for the representation of the most\nmanifold dream thoughts. Dreams of flying, for the most part\ncharacterised by delight, require the most widely different\ninterpretations\u2014altogether special interpretations in the case of some\npersons, and even interpretations of a typical nature in that of others.\nOne of my patients was in the habit of dreaming very often that she was\nsuspended above the street at a certain height, without touching the\nground. She had grown only to a very small stature, and shunned every\nkind of contamination which accompanies intercourse with human beings.\nHer dream of suspension fulfilled both of her wishes, by raising her\nfeet from the ground and by allowing her head to tower in the upper\nregions. In the case of other female dreamers the dream of flying had\nthe significance of a longing: If I were a little bird; others thus\nbecome angels at night because they have missed being called that by\nday. The intimate connection between flying and the idea of a bird makes\nit comprehensible that the dream of flying in the case of men usually\nhas a significance of coarse sensuality.[CK] We shall also not be\nsurprised to hear that this or that dreamer is always very proud of his\nability to fly.\nDr. Paul Federn (Vienna) has propounded the fascinating theory that a\ngreat many flying dreams are erection dreams, since the remarkable\nphenomena of erection which so constantly occupy the human phantasy must\nstrongly impress upon it a notion of the suspension of gravity (_cf._\nthe winged phalli of the ancients).\nDreams of falling are most frequently characterised by fear. Their\ninterpretation, when they occur in women, is subject to no difficulty\nbecause women always accept the symbolic sense of falling, which is a\ncircumlocution for the indulgence of an erotic temptation. We have not\nyet exhausted the infantile sources of the dream of falling; nearly all\nchildren have fallen occasionally, and then been picked up and fondled;\nif they fell out of bed at night, they were picked up by their nurse and\ntaken into her bed.\nPeople who dream often of swimming, of cleaving the waves, with great\nenjoyment, &c., have usually been persons who wetted their beds, and\nthey now repeat in the dream a pleasure which they have long since\nlearned to forgo. We shall soon learn from one example or another to\nwhat representation the dreams of swimming easily lend themselves.\nThe interpretation of dreams about fire justifies a prohibition of the\nnursery which forbids children to burn matches in order that they may\nnot wet the bed at night. They too are based on the reminiscence of\n_enuresis nocturnus_ of childhood. In the _Bruchst\u00fcck einer\nHysterieanalyse_, 1905,[CL] I have given the complete analysis and\nsynthesis of such a fire-dream in connection with the infantile history\nof the dreamer, and have shown to the representation of what emotions\nthis infantile material has been utilised in maturer years.\nIt would be possible to cite a considerable number of other \u201ctypical\u201d\ndreams, if these are understood to refer to the frequent recurrence of\nthe same manifest dream content in the case of different dreamers, as,\nfor example: dreams of passing through narrow alleys, of walking through\na whole suite of rooms; dreams of the nocturnal burglar against whom\nnervous people direct precautionary measures before going to sleep;\ndreams of being chased by wild animals (bulls, horses), or of being\nthreatened with knives, daggers, and lances. The last two are\ncharacteristic as the manifest dream content of persons suffering from\nanxiety, &c. An investigation dealing especially with this material\nwould be well worth while. In lieu of this I have two remarks to offer,\nwhich, however, do not apply exclusively to typical dreams.\nI. The more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, the more\nwilling one must become to acknowledge that the majority of the dreams\nof adults treat of sexual material and give expression to erotic wishes.\nOnly one who really analyses dreams, that is to say, who pushes forward\nfrom their manifest content to the latent dream thoughts, can form an\nopinion on this subject\u2014never the person who is satisfied with\nregistering the manifest content (as, for example, N\u00e4cke in his works on\nsexual dreams). Let us recognise at once that this fact is not to be\nwondered at, but that it is in complete harmony with the fundamental\nassumptions of dream explanation. No other impulse has had to undergo so\nmuch suppression from the time of childhood as the sex impulse in its\nnumerous components,[CM] from no other impulse have survived so many and\nsuch intense unconscious wishes, which now act in the sleeping state in\nsuch a manner as to produce dreams. In dream interpretation, this\nsignificance of sexual complexes must never be forgotten, nor must they,\nof course, be exaggerated to the point of being considered exclusive.\nOf many dreams it can be ascertained by a careful interpretation that\nthey are even to be taken bisexually, inasmuch as they result in an\nirrefutable secondary interpretation in which they realise homosexual\nfeelings\u2014that is, feelings that are common to the normal sexual activity\nof the dreaming person. But that all dreams are to be interpreted\nbisexually, as maintained by W. Stekel,[CN] and Alf. Adler,[CO] seems to\nme to be a generalisation as indemonstrable as it is improbable, which I\nshould not like to support. Above all I should not know how to dispose\nof the apparent fact that there are many dreams satisfying other than\u2014in\nthe widest sense\u2014erotic needs, as dreams of hunger, thirst, convenience,\n&c. Likewise the similar assertions \u201cthat behind every dream one finds\nthe death sentence\u201d (Stekel), and that every dream shows \u201ca continuation\nfrom the feminine to the masculine line\u201d (Adler), seem to me to proceed\nfar beyond what is admissible in the interpretation of dreams.\nWe have already asserted elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuously\ninnocent invariably embody coarse erotic wishes, and we might confirm\nthis by means of numerous fresh examples. But many dreams which appear\nindifferent, and which would never be suspected of any particular\nsignificance, can be traced back, after analysis, to unmistakably sexual\nwish-feelings, which are often of an unexpected nature. For example, who\nwould suspect a sexual wish in the following dream until the\ninterpretation had been worked out? The dreamer relates: _Between two\nstately palaces stands a little house, receding somewhat, whose doors\nare closed. My wife leads me a little way along the street up to the\nlittle house, and pushes in the door, and then I slip quickly and easily\ninto the interior of a courtyard that slants obliquely upwards._\nAnyone who has had experience in the translating of dreams will, of\ncourse, immediately perceive that penetrating into narrow spaces, and\nopening locked doors, belong to the commonest sexual symbolism, and will\neasily find in this dream a representation of attempted coition from\nbehind (between the two stately buttocks of the female body). The narrow\nslanting passage is of course the vagina; the assistance attributed to\nthe wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality it\nis only consideration for the wife which is responsible for the\ndetention from such an attempt. Moreover, inquiry shows that on the\nprevious day a young girl had entered the household of the dreamer who\nhad pleased him, and who had given him the impression that she would not\nbe altogether opposed to an approach of this sort. The little house\nbetween the two palaces is taken from a reminiscence of the Hradschin in\nPrague, and thus points again to the girl who is a native of that city.\nIf with my patients I emphasise the frequency of the Oedipus dream\u2014of\nhaving sexual intercourse with one\u2019s mother\u2014I get the answer: \u201cI cannot\nremember such a dream.\u201d Immediately afterwards, however, there arises\nthe recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream, which has\nbeen dreamed repeatedly by the patient, and the analysis shows it to be\na dream of this same content\u2014that is, another Oedipus dream. I can\nassure the reader that veiled dreams of sexual intercourse with the\nmother are a great deal more frequent than open ones to the same\neffect.[CP]\nThere are dreams about landscapes and localities in which emphasis is\nalways laid upon the assurance: \u201cI have been there before.\u201d In this case\nthe locality is always the genital organ of the mother; it can indeed be\nasserted with such certainty of no other locality that one \u201chas been\nthere before.\u201d\nA large number of dreams, often full of fear, which are concerned with\npassing through narrow spaces or with staying in the water, are based\nupon fancies about the embryonic life, about the sojourn in the mother\u2019s\nwomb, and about the act of birth. The following is the dream of a young\nman who in his fancy has already while in embryo taken advantage of his\nopportunity to spy upon an act of coition between his parents.\n\u201c_He is in a deep shaft, in which there is a window, as in the Semmering\nTunnel. At first he sees an empty landscape through this window, and\nthen he composes a picture into it, which is immediately at hand and\nwhich fills out the empty space. The picture represents a field which is\nbeing thoroughly harrowed by an implement, and the delightful air, the\naccompanying idea of hard work, and the bluish-black clods of earth make\na pleasant impression. He then goes on and sees a primary school\nopened ... and he is surprised that so much attention is devoted in it\nto the sexual feelings of the child, which makes him think of me._\u201d\nHere is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, which was turned to\nextraordinary account in the course of treatment.\n_At her summer resort at the ... Lake, she hurls herself into the dark\nwater at a place where the pale moon is reflected in the water._\nDreams of this sort are parturition dreams; their interpretation is\naccomplished by reversing the fact reported in the manifest dream\ncontent; thus, instead of \u201cthrowing one\u2019s self into the water,\u201d read\n\u201ccoming out of the water,\u201d that is, \u201cbeing born.\u201d The place from which\none is born is recognised if one thinks of the bad sense of the French\n\u201cla lune.\u201d The pale moon thus becomes the white \u201cbottom\u201d (Popo), which\nthe child soon recognises as the place from which it came. Now what can\nbe the meaning of the patient\u2019s wishing to be born at her summer resort?\nI asked the dreamer this, and she answered without hesitation: \u201cHasn\u2019t\nthe treatment made me as though I were born again?\u201d Thus the dream\nbecomes an invitation to continue the cure at this summer resort, that\nis, to visit her there; perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusion\nto the wish to become a mother herself.[CQ]\nAnother dream of parturition, with its interpretation, I take from the\nwork of E. Jones.[95] \u201c_She stood at the seashore watching a small boy,\nwho seemed to be hers, wading into the water. This he did till the water\ncovered him, and she could only see his head bobbing up and down near\nthe surface. The scene then changed to the crowded hall of a hotel. Her\nhusband left her, and she \u2018entered into conversation with\u2019 a stranger._\u201d\nThe second half of the dream was discovered in the analysis to represent\na flight from her husband, and the entering into intimate relations with\na third person, behind whom was plainly indicated Mr. X.\u2019s brother\nmentioned in a former dream. The first part of the dream was a fairly\nevident birth phantasy. In dreams as in mythology, the delivery of a\nchild _from_ the uterine waters is commonly presented by distortion as\nthe entry of the child _into_ water; among many others, the births of\nAdonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus are well-known illustrations of this.\nThe bobbing up and down of the head in the water at once recalled to the\npatient the sensation of quickening she had experienced in her only\npregnancy. Thinking of the boy going into the water induced a reverie in\nwhich she saw herself taking him out of the water, carrying him into the\nnursery, washing him and dressing him, and installing him in her\nhousehold.\nThe second half of the dream, therefore, represents thoughts concerning\nthe elopement, which belonged to the first half of the underlying latent\ncontent; the first half of the dream corresponded with the second half\nof the latent content, the birth phantasy. Besides this inversion in\norder, further inversions took place in each half of the dream. In the\nfirst half the child _entered_ the water, and then his head bobbed; in\nthe underlying dream thoughts first the quickening occurred, and then\nthe child left the water (a double inversion). In the second half her\nhusband left her; in the dream thoughts she left her husband.\nAnother parturition dream is related by Abraham[79] of a young woman\nlooking forward to her first confinement (p. 22): From a place in the\nfloor of the house a subterranean canal leads directly into the water\n(parturition path, amniotic liquor). She lifts up a trap in the floor,\nand there immediately appears a creature dressed in a brownish fur,\nwhich almost resembles a seal. This creature changes into the younger\nbrother of the dreamer, to whom she has always stood in maternal\nrelationship.\nDreams of \u201csaving\u201d are connected with parturition dreams. To save,\nespecially to save from the water, is equivalent to giving birth when\ndreamed by a woman; this sense is, however, modified when the dreamer is\na man.[CR]\nRobbers, burglars at night, and ghosts, of which we are afraid before\ngoing to bed, and which occasionally even disturb our sleep, originate\nin one and the same childish reminiscence. They are the nightly visitors\nwho have awakened the child to set it on the chamber so that it may not\nwet the bed, or have lifted the cover in order to see clearly how the\nchild is holding its hands while sleeping. I have been able to induce an\nexact recollection of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some of\nthese anxiety dreams. The robbers were always the father, the ghosts\nmore probably corresponded to feminine persons with white night-gowns.\nII. When one has become familiar with the abundant use of symbolism for\nthe representation of sexual material in dreams, one naturally raises\nthe question whether there are not many of these symbols which appear\nonce and for all with a firmly established significance like the signs\nin stenography; and one is tempted to compile a new dream-book according\nto the cipher method. In this connection it may be remarked that this\nsymbolism does not belong peculiarly to the dream, but rather to\nunconscious thinking, particularly that of the masses, and it is to be\nfound in greater perfection in the folk-lore, in the myths, legends, and\nmanners of speech, in the proverbial sayings, and in the current\nwitticisms of a nation than in its dreams.[CS]\nThe dream takes advantage of this symbolism in order to give a disguised\nrepresentation to its latent thoughts. Among the symbols which are used\nin this manner there are of course many which regularly, or almost\nregularly, mean the same thing. Only it is necessary to keep in mind the\ncurious plasticity of psychic material. Now and then a symbol in the\ndream content may have to be interpreted not symbolically, but according\nto its real meaning; at another time the dreamer, owing to a peculiar\nset of recollections, may create for himself the right to use anything\nwhatever as a sexual symbol, though it is not ordinarily used in that\nway. Nor are the most frequently used sexual symbols unambiguous every\ntime.\nAfter these limitations and reservations I may call attention to the\nfollowing: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) in most cases really\nrepresent the parents of the dreamer;[CT] the dreamer himself or herself\nis the prince or princess. All elongated objects, sticks, tree-trunks,\nand umbrellas (on account of the stretching-up which might be compared\nto an erection), all elongated and sharp weapons, knives, daggers, and\npikes, are intended to represent the male member. A frequent, not very\nintelligible, symbol for the same is a nail-file (on account of the\nrubbing and scraping?). Little cases, boxes, caskets, closets, and\nstoves correspond to the female part. The symbolism of lock and key has\nbeen very gracefully employed by Uhland in his song about the \u201cGrafen\nEberstein,\u201d to make a common smutty joke. The dream of walking through a\nrow of rooms is a brothel or harem dream. Staircases, ladders, and\nflights of stairs, or climbing on these, either upwards or downwards,\nare symbolic representations of the sexual act.[CU] Smooth walls over\nwhich one is climbing, fa\u00e7ades of houses upon which one is letting\noneself down, frequently under great anxiety, correspond to the erect\nhuman body, and probably repeat in the dream reminiscences of the upward\nclimbing of little children on their parents or foster parents. \u201cSmooth\u201d\nwalls are men. Often in a dream of anxiety one is holding on firmly to\nsome projection from a house. Tables, set tables, and boards are women,\nperhaps on account of the opposition which does away with the bodily\ncontours. Since \u201cbed and board\u201d (_mensa et thorus_) constitute marriage,\nthe former are often put for the latter in the dream, and as far as\npracticable the sexual presentation complex is transposed to the eating\ncomplex. Of articles of dress the woman\u2019s hat may frequently be\ndefinitely interpreted as the male genital. In dreams of men one often\nfinds the cravat as a symbol for the penis; this indeed is not only\nbecause cravats hang down long, and are characteristic of the man, but\nalso because one can select them at pleasure, a freedom which is\nprohibited by nature in the original of the symbol. Persons who make use\nof this symbol in the dream are very extravagant with cravats, and\npossess regular collections of them.[CV] All complicated machines and\napparatus in dream are very probably genitals, in the description of\nwhich dream symbolism shows itself to be as tireless as the activity of\nwit. Likewise many landscapes in dreams, especially with bridges or with\nwooded mountains, can be readily recognised as descriptions of the\ngenitals. Finally where one finds incomprehensible neologisms one may\nthink of combinations made up of components having a sexual\nsignificance. Children also in the dream often signify the genitals, as\nmen and women are in the habit of fondly referring to their genital\norgan as their \u201clittle one.\u201d As a very recent symbol of the male genital\nmay be mentioned the flying machine, utilisation of which is justified\nby its relation to flying as well as occasionally by its form. To play\nwith a little child or to beat a little one is often the dream\u2019s\nrepresentation of onanism. A number of other symbols, in part not\nsufficiently verified, are given by Stekel,[114] who illustrates them\nwith examples. Right and left, according to him, are to be conceived in\nthe dream in an ethical sense. \u201cThe right way always signifies the road\nto righteousness, the left the one to crime. Thus the left may signify\nhomosexuality, incest, and perversion, while the right signifies\nmarriage, relations with a prostitute, &c. The meaning is always\ndetermined by the individual moral viewpoint of the dreamer\u201d (_l.c._, p.\n466). Relatives in the dream generally play the r\u00f4le of genitals (p.\n473). Not to be able to catch up with a wagon is interpreted by Stekel\nas regret not to be able to come up to a difference in age (p. 479).\nBaggage with which one travels is the burden of sin by which one is\noppressed (_ibid._). Also numbers, which frequently occur in the dream,\nare assigned by Stekel a fixed symbolical meaning, but these\ninterpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor of general\nvalidity, although the interpretation in individual cases can generally\nbe recognised as probable. In a recently published book by W. Stekel,\n_Die Sprache des Traumes_, which I was unable to utilise, there is a\nlist (p. 72) of the most common sexual symbols, the object of which is\nto prove that all sexual symbols can be bisexually used. He states: \u201cIs\nthere a symbol which (if in any way permitted by the phantasy) may not\nbe used simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense!\u201d To be\nsure the clause in parentheses takes away much of the absoluteness of\nthis assertion, for this is not at all permitted by the phantasy. I do\nnot, however, think it superfluous to state that in my experience\nStekel\u2019s general statement has to give way to the recognition of a\ngreater manifoldness. Besides those symbols, which are just as frequent\nfor the male as for the female genitals, there are others which\npreponderately, or almost exclusively, designate one of the sexes, and\nthere are still others of which only the male or only the female\nsignification is known. To use long, firm objects and weapons as symbols\nof the female genitals, or hollow objects (chests, boxes, pouches, &c.),\nas symbols of the male genitals, is indeed not allowed by the fancy.\nIt is true that the tendency of the dream and the unconscious fancy to\nutilise the sexual symbol bisexually betrays an archaic trend, for in\nchildhood a difference in the genitals is unknown, and the same genitals\nare attributed to both sexes.\nThese very incomplete suggestions may suffice to stimulate others to\nmake a more careful collection.[CW]\nI shall now add a few examples of the application of such symbolisms in\ndreams, which will serve to show how impossible it becomes to interpret\na dream without taking into account the symbolism of dreams, and how\nimperatively it obtrudes itself in many cases.\n1. The hat as a symbol of the man (of the male genital):[CX] (a fragment\nfrom the dream of a young woman who suffered from agoraphobia on account\nof a fear of temptation).\n\u201cI am walking in the street in summer, I wear a straw hat of peculiar\nshape, the middle piece of which is bent upwards and the side pieces of\nwhich hang downwards (the description became here obstructed), and in\nsuch a fashion that one is lower than the other. I am cheerful and in a\nconfidential mood, and as I pass a troop of young officers I think to\nmyself: None of you can have any designs upon me.\u201d\nAs she could produce no associations to the hat, I said to her: \u201cThe hat\nis really a male genital, with its raised middle piece and the two\ndownward hanging side pieces.\u201d I intentionally refrained from\ninterpreting those details concerning the unequal downward hanging of\nthe two side pieces, although just such individualities in the\ndeterminations lead the way to the interpretation. I continued by saying\nthat if she only had a man with such a virile genital she would not have\nto fear the officers\u2014that is, she would have nothing to wish from them,\nfor she is mainly kept from going without protection and company by her\nfancies of temptation. This last explanation of her fear I had already\nbeen able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other material.\nIt is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after this\ninterpretation. She withdrew her description of the hat, and claimed not\nto have said that the two side pieces were hanging downwards. I was,\nhowever, too sure of what I had heard to allow myself to be misled, and\nI persisted in it. She was quiet for a while, and then found the courage\nto ask why it was that one of her husband\u2019s testicles was lower than the\nother, and whether it was the same in all men. With this the peculiar\ndetail of the hat was explained, and the whole interpretation was\naccepted by her. The hat symbol was familiar to me long before the\npatient related this dream. From other but less transparent cases I\nbelieve that the hat may also be taken as a female genital.\n2. The little one as the genital\u2014to be run over as a symbol of sexual\nintercourse (another dream of the same agoraphobic patient).\n\u201cHer mother sends away her little daughter so that she must go alone.\nShe rides with her mother to the railroad and sees her little one\nwalking directly upon the tracks, so that she cannot avoid being run\nover. She hears the bones crackle. (From this she experiences a feeling\nof discomfort but no real horror.) She then looks out through the car\nwindow to see whether the parts cannot be seen behind. She then\nreproaches her mother for allowing the little one to go out alone.\u201d\nAnalysis. It is not an easy matter to give here a complete\ninterpretation of the dream. It forms part of a cycle of dreams, and can\nbe fully understood only in connection with the others. For it is not\neasy to get the necessary material sufficiently isolated to prove the\nsymbolism. The patient at first finds that the railroad journey is to be\ninterpreted historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatorium\nfor nervous diseases, with the superintendent of which she naturally was\nin love. Her mother took her away from this place, and the physician\ncame to the railroad station and handed her a bouquet of flowers on\nleaving; she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed this\nhomage. Here the mother, therefore, appears as a disturber of her love\naffairs, which is the r\u00f4le actually played by this strict woman during\nher daughter\u2019s girlhood. The next thought referred to the sentence: \u201cShe\nthen looks to see whether the parts can be seen behind.\u201d In the dream\nfa\u00e7ade one would naturally be compelled to think of the parts of the\nlittle daughter run over and ground up. The thought, however, turns in\nquite a different direction. She recalls that she once saw her father in\nthe bath-room naked from behind; she then begins to talk about the sex\ndifferentiation, and asserts that in the man the genitals can be seen\nfrom behind, but in the woman they cannot. In this connection she now\nherself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital,\nher little one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own genital. She\nreproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had no\ngenital, and recognises this reproach in the introductory sentence of\nthe dream; the mother sends away her little one so that she must go\nalone. In her phantasy going alone on the street signifies to have no\nman and no sexual relations (coire = to go together), and this she does\nnot like. According to all her statements she really suffered as a girl\non account of the jealousy of her mother, because she showed a\npreference for her father.\nThe \u201clittle one\u201d has been noted[CY] as a symbol for the male or the\nfemale genitals by Stekel, who can refer in this connection to a very\nwidespread usage of language.\nThe deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another dream of\nthe same night in which the dreamer identifies herself with her brother.\nShe was a \u201ctomboy,\u201d and was always being told that she should have been\nborn a boy. This identification with the brother shows with special\nclearness that \u201cthe little one\u201d signifies the genital. The mother\nthreatened him (her) with castration, which could only be understood as\na punishment for playing with the parts, and the identification,\ntherefore, shows that she herself had masturbated as a child, though\nthis fact she now retained only in a memory concerning her brother. An\nearly knowledge of the male genital which she later lost she must have\nacquired at that time according to the assertions of this second dream.\nMoreover the second dream points to the infantile sexual theory that\ngirls originate from boys through castration. After I had told her of\nthis childish belief, she at once confirmed it with an anecdote in which\nthe boy asks the girl: \u201cWas it cut off?\u201d to which the girl replied, \u201cNo,\nit\u2019s always been so.\u201d\nThe sending away of the little one, of the genital, in the first dream\ntherefore also refers to the threatened castration. Finally she blames\nher mother for not having been born a boy.\nThat \u201cbeing run over\u201d symbolises sexual intercourse would not be evident\nfrom this dream if we were not sure of it from many other sources.\n3. Representation of the genital by structures, stairways, and shafts.\n(Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.)\n\u201cHe is taking a walk with his father in a place which is surely the\nPrater, for the _Rotunda_ may be seen in front of which there is a small\nfront structure to which is attached a captive balloon; the balloon,\nhowever, seems quite collapsed. His father asks him what this is all\nfor; he is surprised at it, but he explains it to his father. They come\ninto a court in which lies a large sheet of tin. His father wants to\npull off a big piece of this, but first looks around to see if anyone is\nwatching. He tells his father that all he needs to do is to speak to the\nwatchman, and then he can take without any further difficulty as much as\nhe wants to. From this court a stairway leads down into a shaft, the\nwalls of which are softly upholstered something like a leather\npocket-book. At the end of this shaft there is a longer platform, and\nthen a new shaft begins....\u201d\nAnalysis. This dream belongs to a type of patient which is not\nfavourable from a therapeutic point of view. They follow in the analysis\nwithout offering any resistances whatever up to a certain point, but\nfrom that point on they remain almost inaccessible. This dream he almost\nanalysed himself. \u201cThe Rotunda,\u201d he said, \u201cis my genital, the captive\nballoon in front is my penis, about the weakness of which I have\nworried.\u201d We must, however, interpret in greater detail; the Rotunda is\nthe buttock which is regularly associated by the child with the genital,\nthe smaller front structure is the scrotum. In the dream his father asks\nhim what this is all for\u2014that is, he asks him about the purpose and\narrangement of the genitals. It is quite evident that this state of\naffairs should be turned around, and that he should be the questioner.\nAs such a questioning on the side of the father has never taken place in\nreality, we must conceive the dream thought as a wish, or take it\nconditionally, as follows: \u201cIf I had only asked my father for sexual\nenlightenment.\u201d The continuation of this thought we shall soon find in\nanother place.\nThe court in which the tin sheet is spread out is not to be conceived\nsymbolically in the first instance, but originates from his father\u2019s\nplace of business. For discretionary reasons I have inserted the tin for\nanother material in which the father deals, without, however, changing\nanything in the verbal expression of the dream. The dreamer had entered\nhis father\u2019s business, and had taken a terrible dislike to the\nquestionable practices upon which profit mainly depends. Hence the\ncontinuation of the above dream thought (\u201cif I had only asked him\u201d)\nwould be: \u201cHe would have deceived me just as he does his customers.\u201d For\nthe pulling off, which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, the\ndreamer himself gives a second explanation\u2014namely, onanism. This is not\nonly entirely familiar to us (see above, p. 234), but agrees very well\nwith the fact that the secrecy of onanism is expressed by its opposite\n(\u201cWhy one can do it quite openly\u201d). It, moreover, agrees entirely with\nour expectations that the onanistic activity is again put off on the\nfather, just as was the questioning in the first scene of the dream. The\nshaft he at once interprets as the vagina by referring to the soft\nupholstering of the walls. That the act of coition in the vagina is\ndescribed as a going down instead of in the usual way as a going up, I\nhave also found true in other instances.[CZ]\nThe details that at the end of the first shaft there is a longer\nplatform and then a new shaft, he himself explains biographically. He\nhad for some time consorted with women sexually, but had then given it\nup because of inhibitions and now hopes to be able to take it up again\nwith the aid of the treatment. The dream, however, becomes indistinct\ntoward the end, and to the experienced interpreter it becomes evident\nthat in the second scene of the dream the influence of another subject\nhas begun to assert itself; in this his father\u2019s business and his\ndishonest practices signify the first vagina represented as a shaft so\nthat one might think of a reference to the mother.\n4. The male genital symbolised by persons and the female by a landscape.\n(Dream of a woman of the lower class, whose husband is a policeman,\nreported by B. Dattner.)\n... Then someone broke into the house and anxiously called for a\npoliceman. But he went with two tramps by mutual consent into a\nchurch,[DA] to which led a great many stairs;[DB] behind the church\nthere was a mountain,[DC] on top of which a dense forest.[DD] The\npoliceman was furnished with a helmet, a gorget, and a cloak.[DE] The\ntwo vagrants, who went along with the policeman quite peaceably, had\ntied to their loins sack-like aprons.[DF] A road led from the church to\nthe mountain. This road was overgrown on each side with grass and\nbrushwood, which became thicker and thicker as it reached the height of\nthe mountain, where it spread out into quite a forest.\n5. A stairway dream.\n(Reported and interpreted by Otto Rank.)\nFor the following transparent pollution dream, I am indebted to the same\ncolleague who furnished us with the dental-irritation dream reported on\np. 235.\n\u201cI am running down the stairway in the stair-house after a little girl,\nwhom I wish to punish because she has done something to me. At the\nbottom of the stairs some one held the child for me. (A grown-up woman?)\nI grasp it, but do not know whether I have hit it, for I suddenly find\nmyself in the middle of the stairway where I practise coitus with the\nchild (in the air as it were). It is really no coitus, I only rub my\ngenital on her external genital, and in doing this I see it very\ndistinctly, as distinctly as I see her head which is lying sideways.\nDuring the sexual act I see hanging to the left and above me (also as if\nin the air) two small pictures, landscapes, representing a house on a\ngreen. On the smaller one my surname stood in the place where the\npainter\u2019s signature should be; it seemed to be intended for my birthday\npresent. A small sign hung in front of the pictures to the effect that\ncheaper pictures could also be obtained. I then see myself very\nindistinctly lying in bed, just as I had seen myself at the foot of the\nstairs, and I am awakened by a feeling of dampness which came from the\npollution.\u201d\nInterpretation. The dreamer had been in a book-store on the evening of\nthe day of the dream, where, while he was waiting, he examined some\npictures which were exhibited, which represented motives similar to the\ndream pictures. He stepped nearer to a small picture which particularly\ntook his fancy in order to see the name of the artist, which, however,\nwas quite unknown to him.\nLater in the same evening, in company, he heard about a Bohemian\nservant-girl who boasted that her illegitimate child \u201cwas made on the\nstairs.\u201d The dreamer inquired about the details of this unusual\noccurrence, and learned that the servant-girl went with her lover to the\nhome of her parents, where there was no opportunity for sexual\nrelations, and that the excited man performed the act on the stairs. In\nwitty allusion to the mischievous expression used about wine-adulterers,\nthe dreamer remarked, \u201cThe child really grew on the cellar steps.\u201d\nThese experiences of the day, which are quite prominent in the dream\ncontent, were readily reproduced by the dreamer. But he just as readily\nreproduced an old fragment of infantile recollection which was also\nutilised by the dream. The stair-house was the house in which he had\nspent the greatest part of his childhood, and in which he had first\nbecome acquainted with sexual problems. In this house he used, among\nother things, to slide down the banister astride which caused him to\nbecome sexually excited. In the dream he also comes down the stairs very\nrapidly\u2014so rapidly that, according to his own distinct assertions, he\nhardly touched the individual stairs, but rather \u201cflew\u201d or \u201cslid down,\u201d\nas we used to say. Upon reference to this infantile experience, the\nbeginning of the dream seems to represent the factor of sexual\nexcitement. In the same house and in the adjacent residence the dreamer\nused to play pugnacious games with the neighbouring children, in which\nhe satisfied himself just as he did in the dream.\nIf one recalls from Freud\u2019s investigation of sexual symbolism[DG] that\nin the dream stairs or climbing stairs almost regularly symbolises\ncoitus, the dream becomes clear. Its motive power as well as its effect,\nas is shown by the pollution, is of a purely libidinous nature. Sexual\nexcitement became aroused during the sleeping state (in the dream this\nis represented by the rapid running or sliding down the stairs) and the\nsadistic thread in this is, on the basis of the pugnacious playing,\nindicated in the pursuing and overcoming of the child. The libidinous\nexcitement becomes enhanced and urges to sexual action (represented in\nthe dream by the grasping of the child and the conveyance of it to the\nmiddle of the stairway). Up to this point the dream would be one of pure\nsexual symbolism, and obscure for the unpractised dream interpreter. But\nthis symbolic gratification, which would have insured undisturbed sleep,\nwas not sufficient for the powerful libidinous excitement. The\nexcitement leads to an orgasm, and thus the whole stairway symbolism is\nunmasked as a substitute for coitus. Freud lays stress on the rhythmical\ncharacter of both actions as one of the reasons for the sexual\nutilisation of the stairway symbolism, and this dream especially seems\nto corroborate this, for, according to the express assertion of the\ndreamer, the rhythm of a sexual act was the most pronounced feature in\nthe whole dream.\nStill another remark concerning the two pictures, which, aside from\ntheir real significance, also have the value of \u201cWeibsbilder\u201d (literally\n_woman-pictures_, but idiomatically _women_). This is at once shown by\nthe fact that the dream deals with a big and a little picture, just as\nthe dream content presents a big (grown up) and a little girl. That\ncheap pictures could also be obtained points to the prostitution\ncomplex, just as the dreamer\u2019s surname on the little picture and the\nthought that it was intended for his birthday, point to the parent\ncomplex (to be born on the stairway\u2014to be conceived in coitus).\nThe indistinct final scene, in which the dreamer sees himself on the\nstaircase landing lying in bed and feeling wet, seems to go back into\nchildhood even beyond the infantile onanism, and manifestly has its\nprototype in similarly pleasurable scenes of bed-wetting.\n6. A modified stair-dream.\nTo one of my very nervous patients, who was an abstainer, whose fancy\nwas fixed on his mother, and who repeatedly dreamed of climbing stairs\naccompanied by his mother, I once remarked that moderate masturbation\nwould be less harmful to him than enforced abstinence. This influence\nprovoked the following dream:\n\u201cHis piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his piano-playing, and\nfor not practising the _\u00c9tudes_ of Moscheles and Clementi\u2019s _Gradus ad\nParnassum_.\u201d In relation to this he remarked that the _Gradus_ is only a\nstairway, and that the piano itself is only a stairway as it has a\nscale.\nIt is correct to say that there is no series of associations which\ncannot be adapted to the representation of sexual facts. I conclude with\nthe dream of a chemist, a young man, who has been trying to give up his\nhabit of masturbation by replacing it with intercourse with women.\n_Preliminary statement._\u2014On the day before the dream he had given a\nstudent instruction concerning Grignard\u2019s reaction, in which magnesium\nis to be dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalytic\ninfluence of iodine. Two days before, there had been an explosion in the\ncourse of the same reaction, in which the investigator had burned his\nhand.\nDream I. _He is to make phenylmagnesiumbromid; he sees the apparatus\nwith particular clearness, but he has substituted himself for the\nmagnesium. He is now in a curious swaying attitude. He keeps repeating\nto himself, \u201cThis is the right thing, it is working, my feet are\nbeginning to dissolve and my knees are getting soft.\u201d Then he reaches\ndown and feels for his feet, and meanwhile (he does not know how) he\ntakes his legs out of the crucible, and then again he says to himself,\n\u201cThat cannot be.... Yes, it must be so, it has been done correctly.\u201d\nThen he partially awakens, and repeats the dream to himself, because he\nwants to tell it to me. He is distinctly afraid of the analysis of the\ndream. He is much excited during this semi-sleeping state, and repeats\ncontinually, \u201cPhenyl, phenyl.\u201d_\nII. _He is in ... ing with his whole family; at half-past eleven. He is\nto be at the Schottenthor for a rendezvous with a certain lady, but he\ndoes not wake up until half-past eleven. He says to himself, \u201cIt is too\nlate now; when you get there it will be half-past twelve.\u201d The next\ninstant he sees the whole family gathered about the table\u2014his mother and\nthe servant girl with the soup-tureen with particular clearness. Then he\nsays to himself, \u201cWell, if we are eating already, I certainly can\u2019t get\naway.\u201d_\nAnalysis: He feels sure that even the first dream contains a reference\nto the lady whom he is to meet at the rendezvous (the dream was dreamed\nduring the night before the expected meeting). The student to whom he\ngave the instruction is a particularly unpleasant fellow; he had said to\nthe chemist: \u201cThat isn\u2019t right,\u201d because the magnesium was still\nunaffected, and the latter answered as though he did not care anything\nabout it: \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t right.\u201d He himself must be this student;\nhe is as indifferent towards his analysis as the student is towards his\nsynthesis; the _He_ in the dream, however, who accomplishes the\noperation, is myself. How unpleasant he must seem to me with his\nindifference towards the success achieved!\nMoreover, he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) is\nmade. For it is a question of the success of the treatment. The legs in\nthe dream recall an impression of the previous evening. He met a lady at\na dancing lesson whom he wished to conquer; he pressed her to him so\nclosely that she once cried out. After he had stopped pressing against\nher legs, he felt her firm responding pressure against his lower thighs\nas far as just above his knees, at the place mentioned in the dream. In\nthis situation, then, the woman is the magnesium in the retort, which is\nat last working. He is feminine towards me, as he is masculine towards\nthe woman. If it will work with the woman, the treatment will also work.\nFeeling and becoming aware of himself in the region of his knees refers\nto masturbation, and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous day....\nThe rendezvous had actually been set for half-past eleven. His wish to\nover-sleep and to remain with his usual sexual objects (that is, with\nmasturbation) corresponds with his resistance.\nIn relation to the repetition of the name phenyl, he gives the following\nthoughts: All these radicals ending in _yl_ have always been pleasing to\nhim; they are very convenient to use: benzyl, azetyl, &c. That, however,\nexplained nothing. But when I proposed the radical Schlemihl[DH] he\nlaughed heartily, and related that during the summer he had read a book\nby Pr\u00e9vost which contained a chapter: \u201cLes exclus de l\u2019amour,\u201d the\ndescription in which made him think of the Schlemihls, and he added,\n\u201cThat is my case.\u201d He would have again acted the Schlemihl if he had\nmissed the rendezvous.\nVI\nTHE DREAM-WORK\nAll previous attempts to solve the problems of the dream have been based\ndirectly upon the manifest dream content as it is retained in the\nmemory, and have undertaken to obtain an interpretation of the dream\nfrom this content, or, if interpretation was dispensed with, to base a\njudgment of the dream upon the evidence furnished by this content. We\nalone are in possession of new data; for us a new psychic material\nintervenes between the dream content and the results of our\ninvestigations: and this is the _latent_ dream content or the dream\nthoughts which are obtained by our method. We develop a solution of the\ndream from this latter, and not from the manifest dream content. We are\nalso confronted for the first time with a problem which has not before\nexisted, that of examining and tracing the relations between the latent\ndream thoughts and the manifest dream content, and the processes through\nwhich the former have grown into the latter.\nWe regard the dream thoughts and the dream content as two\nrepresentations of the same meaning in two different languages; or to\nexpress it better, the dream content appears to us as a translation of\nthe dream thoughts into another form of expression, whose signs and laws\nof composition we are to learn by comparing the original with the\ntranslation. The dream thoughts are at once intelligible to us as soon\nas we have ascertained them. The dream content is, as it were, presented\nin a picture-writing, whose signs are to be translated one by one into\nthe language of the dream thoughts. It would of course be incorrect to\ntry to read these signs according to their values as pictures instead of\naccording to their significance as signs. For instance, I have before me\na picture-puzzle (rebus): a house, upon whose roof there is a boat; then\na running figure whose head has been apostrophised away, and the like. I\nmight now be tempted as a critic to consider this composition and its\nelements nonsensical. A boat does not belong on the roof of a house and\na person without a head cannot run; the person, too, is larger than the\nhouse, and if the whole thing is to represent a landscape, the single\nletters of the alphabet do not fit into it, for of course they do not\noccur in pure nature. A correct judgment of the picture-puzzle results\nonly if I make no such objections to the whole and its parts, but if, on\nthe contrary, I take pains to replace each picture by the syllable or\nword which it is capable of representing by means of any sort of\nreference, the words which are thus brought together are no longer\nmeaningless, but may constitute a most beautiful and sensible\nexpression. Now the dream is a picture-puzzle of this sort, and our\npredecessors in the field of dream interpretation have made the mistake\nof judging the rebus as an artistic composition. As such it appears\nnonsensical and worthless.\n(_a_) _The Condensation Work_\nThe first thing which becomes clear to the investigator in the\ncomparison of the dream content with the dream thoughts is that a\ntremendous work of condensation has taken place. The dream is reserved,\npaltry, and laconic when compared with the range and copiousness of the\ndream thoughts. The dream when written down fills half a page; the\nanalysis, in which the dream thoughts are contained, requires six,\neight, twelve times as much space. The ratio varies with different\ndreams; it never changes its essential meaning, as far as I have been\nable to observe. As a rule the extent of the compression which has taken\nplace is under-estimated, owing to the fact that the dream thoughts\nwhich are brought to light are considered the complete material, while\ncontinued work of interpretation may reveal new thoughts which are\nconcealed behind the dream. We have already mentioned that one is really\nnever sure of having interpreted a dream completely; even if the\nsolution seems satisfying and flawless, it still always remains possible\nthat there is a further meaning which is manifested by the same dream.\nThus the _amount of condensation_ is\u2014strictly speaking\u2014indeterminable.\nAn objection, which at first sight seems very plausible, might be raised\nagainst the assertion that the disproportion between dream content and\ndream thought justifies the conclusion that an abundant condensation of\npsychic material has taken place in the formation of dreams. For we so\noften have the impression that we have dreamed a great deal throughout\nthe night and then have forgotten the greater part. The dream which we\nrecollect upon awakening would thus be only a remnant of the total\ndream-work, which would probably equal the dream thoughts in range if we\nwere able to remember the former completely. In part this is certainly\ntrue; there can be no mistake about the observation that the dream is\nmost accurately reproduced if one tries to remember it immediately after\nawakening, and that the recollection of it becomes more and more\ndefective towards evening. On the other hand, it must be admitted that\nthe impression that we have dreamed a good deal more than we are able to\nreproduce is often based upon an illusion, the cause of which will be\nexplained later. Moreover, the assumption of condensation in the dream\nactivity is not affected by the possibility of forgetting in dreams, for\nit is proved by groups of ideas belonging to those particular parts of\nthe dream which have remained in the memory. If a large part of the\ndream has actually been lost to memory, we are probably deprived of\naccess to a new series of dream thoughts. It is altogether unjustifiable\nto expect that those portions of the dream which have been lost also\nrelate to the thoughts with which we are already acquainted from the\nanalysis of the portions which have been preserved.\nIn view of the great number of ideas which analysis furnishes for each\nindividual element of the dream content, the chief doubt with many\nreaders will be whether it is permissible to count everything that\nsubsequently comes to mind during analysis as a part of the dream\nthoughts\u2014to assume, in other words, that all these thoughts have been\nactive in the sleeping state and have taken part in the formation of the\ndream. Is it not more probable that thought connections are developed in\nthe course of analysis which did not participate in the formation of the\ndream? I can meet this doubt only conditionally. It is true, of course,\nthat particular thought connections first arise only during analysis;\nbut one may always be sure that such new connections have been\nestablished only between thoughts which have already been connected in\nthe dream thoughts by other means; the new connections are, so to speak,\ncorollaries, short circuits, which are made possible by the existence of\nother more fundamental means of connection. It must be admitted that the\nhuge number of trains of thought revealed by analysis have already been\nactive in the formation of the dream, for if a chain of thoughts has\nbeen worked out, which seems to be without connection with the formation\nof the dream, a thought is suddenly encountered which, being represented\nin the dream, is indispensable to its interpretation\u2014which nevertheless\nis inaccessible except through that chain of thoughts. The reader may\nhere turn to the dream of the botanical monograph, which is obviously\nthe result of an astonishing condensation activity, even though I have\nnot given the analysis of it completely.\nBut how, then, is the psychic condition during sleep which precedes\ndreaming to be imagined? Do all the dream thoughts exist side by side,\nor do they occur one after another, or are many simultaneous trains of\nthought constructed from different centres, which meet later on? I am of\nthe opinion that it is not yet necessary to form a plastic conception of\nthe psychic condition of dream formation. Only let us not forget that we\nare concerned with unconscious thought, and that the process may easily\nbe a different one from that which we perceive in ourselves in\nintentional contemplation accompanied by consciousness.\nThe fact, however, that dream formation is based on a process of\ncondensation, stands indubitable. How, then, is this condensation\nbrought about?\nIf it be considered that of those dream thoughts which are found only\nthe smallest number are represented in the dream by means of one of its\nideal elements, it might be concluded that condensation is accomplished\nby means of ellipsis, in that the dream is not an accurate translation\nor a projection point by point of the dream thoughts, but a very\nincomplete and defective reproduction of them. This view, as we shall\nsoon find, is a very inadequate one. But let us take it as a starting\npoint for the present, and ask ourselves: If only a few of the elements\nof the dream thoughts get into the dream content, what conditions\ndetermine their choice?\nIn order to gain enlightenment on this subject let us turn our attention\nto those elements of the dream content which must have fulfilled the\nconditions we are seeking. A dream to the formation of which an\nespecially strong condensation has contributed will be the most suitable\nmaterial for this investigation. I select the dream, cited on page 142,\nof the botanical monograph.\nDream content: _I have written a monograph upon a (obscure) certain\nplant. The book lies before me, I am just turning over a folded coloured\nplate. A dried specimen of the plant is bound with every copy as though\nfrom a herbarium._\nThe most prominent element of this dream is the botanical monograph.\nThis comes from the impressions received on the day of the dream; I had\nactually _seen a monograph on the genus \u201ccyclamen\u201d_ in the show-window\nof a book-store. The mention of this genus is lacking in the dream\ncontent, in which only the monograph and its relation to botany have\nremained. The \u201cbotanical monograph\u201d immediately shows its relation to\nthe work on cocaine which I had once written; thought connections\nproceed from cocaine on the one hand to a \u201cFestschrift,\u201d and on the\nother to my friend, the eye specialist, Dr. Koenigstein, who has had a\nshare in the utilisation of cocaine. Moreover, with the person of this\nDr. Koenigstein is connected the recollection of the interrupted\nconversation which I had had with him on the previous evening and of the\nmanifold thoughts about remuneration for medical services among\ncolleagues. This conversation, then, is properly the actual stimulus of\nthe dream; the monograph about cyclamen is likewise an actuality but of\nan indifferent nature; as I soon see, the \u201cbotanical monograph\u201d of the\ndream turns out to be a common mean between the two experiences of the\nday, and to have been taken over unchanged from an indifferent\nimpression and bound up with the psychologically significant experience\nby means of the most abundant associations.\nNot only the combined idea, \u201cbotanical monograph,\u201d however, but also\neach of the separate elements, \u201cbotanical\u201d and \u201cmonograph,\u201d penetrates\ndeeper and deeper into the confused tangle of the dream thoughts. To\n\u201cbotanical\u201d belong the recollections of the person of Professor\n_Gartner_ (German: G\u00e4rtner = gardener), of his _blooming_ wife, of my\npatient whose name is _Flora_, and of a lady about whom I told the story\nof the forgotten _flowers_. _Gartner_, again, is connected with the\nlaboratory and the conversation with _Koenigstein_; the mention of the\ntwo female patients also belongs to the same conversation. A chain of\nthoughts, one end of which is formed by the title of the hastily seen\nmonograph, leads off in the other direction from the lady with the\nflowers to the _favourite flowers_ of my wife. Besides this, \u201cbotanical\u201d\nrecalls not only an episode at the Gymnasium, but an examination taken\nwhile I was at the university; and a new subject matter\u2014my hobbies\u2014which\nwas broached in the conversation already mentioned, is connected by\nmeans of my humorously so-called _favourite flower_, the artichoke, with\nthe chain of thoughts proceeding from the forgotten flowers; behind\n\u201cartichoke\u201d there is concealed on the one hand a recollection of Italy,\nand on the other a reminiscence of a childhood scene in which I first\nformed my connection with books which has since grown so intimate.\n\u201cBotanical,\u201d then, is a veritable nucleus, the centre for the dream of\nmany trains of thought, which, I may assure the reader, were correctly\nand justly brought into relation to one another in the conversation\nreferred to. Here we find ourselves in a thought factory, in which, as\nin the \u201cWeaver\u2019s Masterpiece\u201d:\n\u201cOne tread moves thousands of threads,\nThe little shuttles fly back and forth,\nThe threads flow on unseen,\nOne stroke ties thousands of knots.\u201d\n\u201c_Monograph_\u201d in the dream, again, has a bearing upon two subjects, the\none-sidedness of my studies and the costliness of my hobbies.\nThe impression is gained from this first investigation that the elements\n\u201cbotanical\u201d and \u201cmonograph\u201d have been accepted in the dream content\nbecause they were able to show the most extensive connections with the\ndream thoughts, and thus represent nuclei in which a great number of\ndream thoughts come together, and because they have manifold\nsignificance for the dream interpretation. The fact upon which this\nexplanation is based may be expressed in another form: Every element of\nthe dream content turns out to be _over-determined_\u2014that is, it enjoys a\nmanifold representation in the dream thoughts.\nWe shall learn more by testing the remaining component parts of the\ndream as to their occurrence in the dream thoughts. _The coloured plate_\nrefers (_cf._ the analysis on p. 145) to a new subject, the criticism\npassed upon my work by colleagues, and to a subject already represented\nin the dream\u2014my hobbies\u2014and also to a childish recollection in which I\npull to pieces the book with the coloured plates; the dried specimen of\nthe plant relates to an experience at the Gymnasium centering about and\nparticularly emphasizing the herbarium. Thus I see what sort of relation\nexists between the dream content and dream thoughts: Not only do the\nelements of the dream have a manifold determination in the dream\nthoughts, but the individual dream thoughts are represented in the dream\nby many elements. Starting from an element of the dream the path of\nassociations leads to a number of dream thoughts; and from a dream\nthought to several elements of the dream. The formation of the dream\ndoes not, therefore, take place in such fashion that a single one of the\ndream thoughts or a group of them furnishes the dream content with an\nabridgment as its representative therein, and that then another dream\nthought furnishes another abridgment as its representative\u2014somewhat as\npopular representatives are elected from among the people\u2014but the whole\nmass of the dream thoughts is subjected to a certain elaboration, in the\ncourse of which those elements that receive the greatest and completest\nsupport stand out in relief, analogous, perhaps, to election by\n_scrutins des listes_. Whatever dream I may subject to such\ndismemberment, I always find the same fundamental principle\nconfirmed\u2014that the dream elements are constructed from the entire mass\nof the dream thoughts and that every one of them appears in relation to\nthe dream thoughts to have a multiple determination.\nIt is certainly not out of place to demonstrate this relation of the\ndream content to the dream thoughts by means of a fresh example, which\nis distinguished by a particularly artful intertwining of reciprocal\nrelations. The dream is that of a patient whom I am treating for\nclaustrophobia (fear in enclosed spaces). It will soon become evident\nwhy I feel myself called upon to entitle this exceptionally intellectual\npiece of dream activity in the following manner:\nII. \u201c_A Beautiful Dream_\u201d\n_The dreamer is riding with much company to X-street, where there is a\nmodest road-house_ (which is not the fact). _A theatrical performance is\nbeing given in its rooms. He is first audience, then actor. Finally the\ncompany is told to change their clothes, in order to get back into the\ncity. Some of the people are assigned to the rooms on the ground floor,\nothers to the first floor. Then a dispute arises. Those above are angry\nbecause those below have not yet finished, so that they cannot come\ndown. His brother is upstairs, he is below, and he is angry at his\nbrother because there is such crowding._ (This part obscure.) _Besides\nit has already been decided upon their arrival who is to be upstairs and\nwho down. Then he goes alone over the rising ground, across which\nX-street leads toward the city, and he has such difficulty and hardship\nin walking that he cannot move from the spot. An elderly gentleman joins\nhim and scolds about the King of Italy. Finally, towards the end of the\nrising ground walking becomes much easier._\nThe difficulties experienced in walking were so distinct that for some\ntime after waking he was in doubt whether they were dream or reality.\nAccording to the manifest content, this dream can hardly be praised.\nContrary to the rules, I shall begin with that portion which the dreamer\nreferred to as the most distinct.\nThe difficulties which were dreamed of, and which were probably\nexperienced during the dream\u2014difficult climbing accompanied by\ndyspn\u0153a\u2014is one of the symptoms which the patient had actually shown\nyears before, and which, in conjunction with other symptoms, was at that\ntime attributed to tuberculosis (probably hysterically simulated). We\nare already from exhibition dreams acquainted with this sensation of\nbeing hindered, peculiar to the dream, and here again we find it used\nfor the purpose of any kind of representation, as an ever-ready\nmaterial. That part of the dream content which ascribes the climbing as\ndifficult at first, and as becoming easier at the end of the hill, made\nme think while it was being told of the well-known masterful\nintroduction to _Sappho_ by A. Daudet. Here a young man carries the girl\nwhom he loves upstairs\u2014she is at first as light as a feather; but the\nhigher he mounts the more heavily she weighs upon his arm, and this\nscene symbolises a course of events by recounting which Daudet tries to\nwarn young men not to waste serious affection upon girls of humble\norigin or of questionable past.[DI] Although I knew that my patient had\nrecently had a love affair with a lady of the theatre, and had broken it\noff, I did not expect to find that the interpretation which had occurred\nto me was correct. Moreover, the situation in _Sappho_ was the _reverse_\nof that in the dream; in the latter the climbing was difficult at the\nbeginning and easy later on; in the novel the symbolism serves only if\nwhat was at first regarded as easy finally turns out to be a heavy load.\nTo my astonishment, the patient remarked that the interpretation\ncorresponded closely to the plot of a play which he had seen on the\nevening before at the theatre. The play was called _Round about Vienna_,\nand treated of the career of a girl who is respectable at first but\nlater goes over to the _demi-monde_, who has affairs with persons in\nhigh places, thus \u201cclimbing,\u201d but finally \u201cgoes down\u201d faster and faster.\nThis play had reminded him of another entitled _From Step to Step_, in\nthe advertisement of which had appeared a _stairway_ consisting of\nseveral steps.\nNow to continue the interpretation. The actress with whom he had had his\nmost recent affair, a complicated one, had lived in X-street. There is\nno inn in this street. However, while he was spending a part of the\nsummer in Vienna for the sake of the lady, he had lodged (German\n_abgestiegen_ = stopped, literally _stepped off_) at a little hotel in\nthe neighbourhood. As he was leaving the hotel he said to the\ncab-driver, \u201cI am glad I didn\u2019t get any vermin anyway\u201d (which\nincidentally is one of his phobias). Whereupon the cab-driver answered:\n\u201cHow could anybody stop there! It isn\u2019t a hotel at all, it\u2019s really\nnothing but a _road-house_!\u201d\nThe road-house immediately suggests to the dreamer\u2019s recollection a\nquotation:\n\u201cOf that marvellous host\nI was once a guest.\u201d\nBut the host in the poem by Uhland is an apple tree. Now a second\nquotation continues the train of thought:\nFAUST (_dancing with the young witch_).\n\u201cA lovely dream once came to me;\nI then beheld an apple tree,\nAnd there two fairest apples shone:\nThey lured me so, I climbed thereon.\u201d\nTHE FAIR ONE.\n\u201cApples have been desired by you,\nSince first in Paradise they grew;\nAnd I am moved with joy to know\nThat such within my garden grow.\u201d\n_Translated by_ BAYARD TAYLOR.\nThere remains not the slightest doubt what is meant by the apple tree\nand the apples. A beautiful bosom stood high among the charms with which\nthe actress had bewitched our dreamer.\nAccording to the connections of the analysis we had every reason to\nassume that the dream went back to an impression from childhood. In this\ncase it must have reference to the nurse of the patient, who is now a\nman of nearly fifty years of age. The bosom of the nurse is in reality a\nroad-house for the child. The nurse as well as Daudet\u2019s Sappho appears\nas an allusion to his abandoned sweetheart.\nThe (elder) brother of the patient also appears in the dream content; he\nis upstairs, the dreamer himself is below. This again is an _inversion_,\nfor the brother, as I happen to know, has lost his social position, my\npatient has retained his. In reporting the dream content the dreamer\navoided saying that his brother was upstairs and that he himself was\n_down_. It would have been too frank an expression, for a person is said\nto be \u201cdown and out\u201d when he has lost his fortune and position. Now the\nfact that at this point in the dream something is represented as\ninverted must have a meaning. The inversion must apply rather to some\nother relation between the dream thoughts and dream content. There is an\nindication which suggests how this inversion is to be taken. It\nobviously applies to the end of the dream, where the circumstances of\nclimbing are the reverse of those in _Sappho_. Now it may easily be seen\nwhat inversion is referred to; in _Sappho_ the man carries the woman who\nstands in a sexual relation to him; in the dream thoughts, _inversely_,\na woman carries a man, and as this state of affairs can only occur\nduring childhood, the reference is again to the nurse who carries the\nheavy child. Thus the final portion of the dream succeeds in\nrepresenting _Sappho_ and the nurse in the same allusion.\nJust as the name _Sappho_ has not been selected by the poet without\nreference to a Lesbian custom, so the elements of the dream in which\npersons act _above_ and _below_, point to fancies of a sexual nature\nwith which the dreamer is occupied and which as suppressed cravings are\nnot without connection with his neurosis. Dream interpretation itself\ndoes not show that these are fancies and not recollections of actual\nhappenings; it only furnishes us with a set of thoughts and leaves us to\ndetermine their value as realities. Real and fantastic occurrences at\nfirst appear here as of equal value\u2014and not only here but also in the\ncreation of more important psychic structures than dreams. Much company,\nas we already know, signifies a secret. The brother is none other than a\nrepresentative, drawn into the childhood scene by \u201cfancying backwards,\u201d\nof all of the later rivals for the woman. Through the agency of an\nexperience which is indifferent in itself, the episode with the\ngentleman who scolds about the King of Italy again refers to the\nintrusion of people of low rank into aristocratic society. It is as\nthough the warning which Daudet gives to youth is to be supplemented by\na similar warning applicable to the suckling child.[DJ]\nIn order that we may have at our disposal a third example for the study\nof condensation in dream formation, I shall cite the partial analysis of\nanother dream for which I am indebted to an elderly lady who is being\npsychoanalytically treated. In harmony with the condition of severe\nanxiety from which the patient suffered, her dreams contained a great\nabundance of sexual thought material, the discovery of which astonished\nas well as frightened her. Since I cannot carry the interpretation of\nthe dream to completion, the material seems to fall apart into several\ngroups without apparent connection.\nIII. Content of the dream: _She remembers that she has two June bugs in\na box, which she must set at liberty, for otherwise they will suffocate.\nShe opens the box, and the bugs are quite exhausted; one of them flies\nout of the window, but the other is crushed on the casement while she is\nshutting the window, as some one or other requests her to do\n(expressions of disgust)._\nAnalysis: Her husband is away travelling, and her fourteen-year-old\ndaughter is sleeping in the bed next to her. In the evening the little\none calls her attention to the fact that a moth has fallen into her\nglass of water; but she neglects to take it out, and feels sorry for the\npoor little creature in the morning. A story which she had read in the\nevening told of boys throwing a cat into boiling water, and the\ntwitchings of the animal were described. These are the occasions for the\ndream, both of which are indifferent in themselves. She is further\noccupied with the subject of _cruelty to animals_. Years before, while\nthey were spending the summer at a certain place, her daughter was very\ncruel to animals. She started a butterfly collection, and asked her for\narsenic with which to kill the butterflies. Once it happened that a moth\nflew about the room for a long time with a needle through its body; on\nanother occasion she found that some moths which had been kept for\nmetamorphosis had died of starvation. The same child while still at a\ntender age was in the habit of pulling out the wings of beetles and\nbutterflies; now she would shrink in horror from these cruel actions,\nfor she has grown very kind.\nHer mind is occupied with this contrast. It recalls another contrast,\nthe one between appearance and disposition, as it is described in _Adam\nBede_ by George Eliot. There a beautiful but vain and quite stupid girl\nis placed side by side with an ugly but high-minded one. The aristocrat\nwho seduces the little goose, is opposed to the working man who feels\n_aristocratic_, and behaves accordingly. It is impossible to tell\ncharacter from people\u2019s _looks_. Who could tell from _her_ looks that\nshe is tormented by sensual desires?\nIn the same year in which the little girl started her butterfly\ncollection, the region in which they were staying suffered much from a\npest of June bugs. The children made havoc among the bugs, and _crushed_\nthem cruelly. At that time she saw a person who tore the wings off the\nJune bugs and ate them. She herself had been born in June and also\nmarried in June. Three days after the wedding she wrote a letter home,\ntelling how happy she was. But she was by no means happy.\nDuring the evening before the dream she had rummaged among her old\nletters and had read various ones, comical and serious, to her family\u2014an\nextremely ridiculous letter from a piano-teacher who had paid her\nattention when she was a girl, as well as one from an aristocratic\nadmirer.[DK]\nShe blames herself because a bad book by de Maupassant had fallen into\nthe hands of one of her daughters.[DL] The arsenic which her little girl\nasks for recalls the arsenic pills which restored the power of youth to\nthe Duc de Mora in _Nabab_.\n\u201cSet at liberty\u201d recalls to her a passage from the _Magic Flute_:\n\u201cI cannot compel you to love,\nBut I will not give you your liberty.\u201d\n\u201cJune bugs\u201d suggests the speech of Katie:[DM]\n\u201cI love you like a little beetle.\u201d\nMeanwhile the speech from _Tannhauser_: \u201cFor you are wrought with evil\npassion.\u201d\nShe is living in fear and anxiety about her absent husband. The dread\nthat something may happen to him on the journey is expressed in numerous\nfancies of the day. A little while before, during the analysis, she had\ncome upon a complaint about his \u201csenility\u201d in her unconscious thoughts.\nThe wish thought which this dream conceals may perhaps best be\nconjectured if I say that several days before the dream she was suddenly\nastounded by a command which she directed to her husband in the midst of\nher work: \u201c_Go hang yourself_.\u201d It was found that a few hours before she\nhad read somewhere that a vigorous erection is induced when a person is\nhanged. It was for the erection which freed itself from repression in\nthis terror-inspiring veiled form. \u201cGo hang yourself\u201d is as much as to\nsay: \u201cGet up an erection, at any cost.\u201d Dr. Jenkin\u2019s arsenic pills in\n_Nabab_ belong in this connection; for it was known to the patient that\nthe strongest aphrodisiac, cantharides, is prepared by _crushing bugs_\n(so-called Spanish flies). The most important part of the dream content\nhas a significance to this effect.\nOpening and shutting the _window_ is the subject of a standing quarrel\nwith her husband. She herself likes to sleep with plenty of air, and her\nhusband does not. _Exhaustion_ is the chief ailment of which she\ncomplains these days.\nIn all three of the dreams just cited I have emphasized by italics those\nphrases where one of the elements of the dream recurs in the dream\nthoughts in order to make the manifold references of the former obvious.\nSince, however, the analysis of none of these dreams has been carried to\ncompletion, it will be well worth while to consider a dream with a fully\ndetailed analysis, in order to demonstrate the manifold determination of\nits content. I select the dream of Irma\u2019s injection for this purpose. We\nshall see without effort in this example that the condensation work has\nused more than one means for the formation of the dream.\nThe chief person in the content of the dream is my patient Irma, who is\nseen with the features which belong to her in waking life, and who\ntherefore in the first instance represents herself. But her attitude as\nI examine her at the window is taken from the recollection of another\nperson, of the lady for whom I should like to exchange my patient, as\nthe dream thoughts show. In as far as Irma shows a diphtheritic membrane\nwhich recalls my anxiety about my eldest daughter, she comes to\nrepresent this child of mine, behind whom is concealed the person of the\npatient who died from intoxication and who is brought into connection by\nthe identity of her name. In the further course of the dream the\nsignificance of Irma\u2019s personality changes (without the alteration of\nher image as it is seen in the dream); she becomes one of the children\nwhom we examine in the public dispensaries for children\u2019s diseases,\nwhere my friends show the difference of their mental capabilities. The\ntransference was obviously brought about through the idea of my infant\ndaughter. By means of her unwillingness to open her mouth the same Irma\nis changed into an allusion to another lady who was once examined by me,\nand besides that to my wife, in the same connection. Furthermore, in the\nmorbid transformations which I discover in her throat I have gathered\nallusions to a great number of other persons.\nAll these people whom I encounter as I follow the associations suggested\nby \u201cIrma,\u201d do not appear personally in the dream; they are concealed\nbehind the dream person \u201cIrma,\u201d who is thus developed into a collective\nimage, as might be expected, with contradictory features. Irma comes to\nrepresent these other persons, who are discarded in the work of\ncondensation, in that I cause to happen to her all the things which\nrecall these persons detail for detail.\nI may also construct a collective person for the condensation of the\ndream in another manner, by uniting the actual features of two or more\npersons in one dream image. It is in this manner that Dr. M. in my dream\nwas constructed, he bears the name of Dr. M., and speaks and acts as Dr.\nM. does, but his bodily characteristics and his suffering belong to\nanother person, my eldest brother; a single feature, paleness, is doubly\ndetermined, owing to the fact that it is common to both persons. Dr. R.\nin my dream about my uncle is a similar composite person. But here the\ndream image is prepared in still another manner. I have not united\nfeatures peculiar to the one with features of the other, and thereby\nabridged the remembered image of each by certain features, but I have\nadopted the method employed by Galton in producing family portraits, by\nwhich he projects both pictures upon one another, whereupon the common\nfeatures stand out in stronger relief, while those which do not coincide\nneutralize one another and become obscure in the picture. In the dream\nof my uncle the _blond beard_ stands out in relief, as an emphasized\nfeature, from the physiognomy, which belongs to two persons, and which\nis therefore blurred; furthermore the beard contains an allusion to my\nfather and to myself, which is made possible by its reference to the\nfact of growing grey.\nThe construction of collective and composite persons is one of the chief\nresources of the activity of dream condensation. There will soon be an\noccasion for treating of this in another connection.\nThe notion \u201cdysentery\u201d in the dream about the injection likewise has a\nmanifold determination, on the one hand because of its paraphasic\nassonance with diphtheria, and on the other because of its reference to\nthe patient, whom I have sent to the Orient, and whose hysteria has been\nwrongly recognised.\nThe mention of \u201cpropyls\u201d in the dream also proves to be an interesting\ncase of condensation. Not \u201cpropyls\u201d but \u201camyls\u201d were contained in the\ndream thoughts. One might think that here a simple displacement had\noccurred in the dream formation. And this is the case, but the\ndisplacement serves the purposes of condensation, as is shown by the\nfollowing supplementary analysis. If I dwell for a moment upon the word\n\u201cpropyls,\u201d its assonance to the word \u201cpropyl\u00e6um\u201d suggests itself to me.\nBut the propyl\u00e6um is to be found not only in Athens but also in Munich.\nIn the latter city I visited a friend the year before who was seriously\nill, and the reference to him becomes unmistakable on account of\n_trimethylamin_, which follows closely upon _propyls_.\nI pass over the striking circumstance that here, as elsewhere in the\nanalysis of dreams, associations of the most widely different values are\nemployed for the establishment of thought connections as though they\nwere equivalent, and I yield to the temptation to regard the process by\nwhich _amyls_ in the dream thoughts are replaced by _propyls_, as though\nit were plastic in the dream content.\nOn the one hand is the chain of ideas about my friend Otto, who does not\nunderstand me, who thinks I am in the wrong, and who gives me the\ncordial that smells like amyls; on the other the chain of\nideas\u2014connected with the first by contrast\u2014about my friend William, who\nunderstands me and who would always think I was in the right, and to\nwhom I am indebted for so much valuable information about the chemistry\nof the sexual processes.\nThose characteristics of the associations centering about Otto which\nought particularly to attract my attention are determined by the recent\noccasions which are responsible for the dream; _amyls_ belong to these\nelements so determined which are destined to get into the dream content.\nThe group of associations \u201cWilliam\u201d is distinctly vivified by the\ncontrast to Otto, and the elements in it which correspond to those\nalready excited in the \u201cOtto\u201d associations are thrown into relief. In\nthis whole dream I am continually referring to a person who excites my\ndispleasure and to another person whom I can oppose to him or her at\nwill, and I conjure up the friend as against the enemy, feature for\nfeature. Thus amyls in the Otto-group suggests recollections in the\nother group belonging to chemistry; trimethylamin, which receives\nsupport from several quarters, finds its way into the dream content.\n\u201cAmyls,\u201d too, might have got into the dream content without undergoing\nchange, but it yields to the influence of the \u201cWilliam\u201d group of\nassociations, owing to the fact that an element which is capable of\nfurnishing a double determination for amyls is sought out from the whole\nrange of recollections which the name \u201cWilliam\u201d covers. The association\n\u201cpropyls\u201d lies in the neighbourhood of _amyls_; Munich with the\npropyl\u00e6um comes to meet _amyls_ from the series of associations\nbelonging to \u201cWilliam.\u201d Both groups are united in _propyls\u2014propyl\u0153um_.\nAs though by a compromise, this intermediary element gets into the dream\ncontent. Here a _common mean_ which permits of a manifold determination\nhas been created. It thus becomes perfectly obvious that manifold\ndetermination must facilitate penetration into the dream content. A\ndisplacement of attention from what is really intended to something\nlying near in the associations has thoughtlessly taken place, for the\nsake of this mean-formation.\nThe study of the injection dream has now enabled us to get some insight\ninto the process of condensation which takes place in the formation of\ndreams. The selection of those elements which occur in the dream content\nmore than once, the formation of new unities (collective persons,\ncomposite images), and the construction of the common mean, these we\nhave been able to recognise as details of the condensing process. The\npurpose which is served by condensation and the means by which it is\nbrought about will be investigated when we come to study the psychic\nprocesses in the formation of dreams as a whole. Let us be content for\nthe present with establishing dream _condensation_ as an important\nrelation between the dream thoughts and the dream content.\nThe condensing activity of the dream becomes most tangible when it has\nselected words and names as its object. In general words are often\ntreated as things by the dream, and thus undergo the same combinations,\ndisplacements, and substitutions, and therefore also condensations, as\nideas of things. The results of such dreams are comical and bizarre word\nformations. Upon one occasion when a colleague had sent me one of his\nessays, in which he had, in my judgment, overestimated the value of a\nrecent physiological discovery and had expressed himself in extravagant\nterms, I dreamed the following night a sentence which obviously referred\nto this treatise: \u201c_That is in true norekdal style_.\u201d The solution of\nthis word formation at first gave me difficulties, although it was\nunquestionably formed as a parody after the pattern of the superlatives\n\u201ccolossal,\u201d \u201cpyramidal\u201d; but to tell where it came from was not easy. At\nlast the monster fell apart into the two names Nora and Ekdal from two\nwell-known plays by Ibsen. I had previously read a newspaper essay on\nIbsen by the same author, whose latest work I was thus criticising in\nthe dream.\nII.[DN] One of my female patients dreams that _a man with a light beard\nand a peculiar glittering eye is pointing to a sign board attached to a\ntree which reads: uclamparia\u2014wet_.\nAnalysis. The man was rather authoritative looking, and his peculiar\nglittering eye at once recalled St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, near Rome, where\nshe saw in mosaics the Popes that have so far ruled. One of the early\nPopes had a golden eye (this was really an optical illusion which the\nguides usually call attention to). Further associations showed that the\ngeneral physiognomy corresponded to her own clergyman (Pope), and the\nshape of the light beard recalled her doctor (myself), while the stature\nof the man in the dream recalled her father. All these persons stand in\nthe same relation to her; they are all guiding and directing her course\nof life. On further questioning, the golden eye recalled gold\u2014money\u2014the\nrather expensive psychoanalytic treatment which gives her a great deal\nof concern. Gold, moreover, recalls the gold cure for alcoholism\u2014Mr. D.,\nwhom she would have married if it had not been for his clinging to the\ndisgusting alcohol habit\u2014she does not object to a person taking an\noccasional drink; she herself sometimes drinks beer and cordials\u2014this\nagain brings her back to her visit to St. Paul\u2019s without the walls and\nits surroundings. She remembers that in the neighbouring monastery of\nthe Three Fountains she drank a liquor made of eucalyptus by the\nTrappist monks who inhabit this monastery. She then relates how the\nmonks transformed this malarial and swampy region into a dry and\nhealthful neighbourhood by planting there many eucalyptus trees. The\nword \u201cuclamparia\u201d then resolves itself into eucalyptus and malaria, and\nthe word \u201cwet\u201d refers to the former swampy nature of the place. Wet also\nsuggests dry. Dry is actually the name of the man whom she would have\nmarried except for his over-indulgence in alcohol. The peculiar name of\nDry is of Germanic origin (drei = three) and hence alludes to the Abbey\nof the Three (drei) Fountains above mentioned. In talking about Mr.\nDry\u2019s habit she used the strong words, \u201cHe could drink a fountain.\u201d Mr.\nDry jocosely refers to his habit by saying, \u201cYou know I must drink\nbecause I am always _dry_\u201d (referring to his name). The eucalyptus also\nrefers to her neurosis, which was at first diagnosed as malaria. She\nwent to Italy because her attacks of anxiety, which were accompanied by\nmarked trembling and shivering, were thought to be of malarial origin.\nShe bought some eucalyptus oil from the monks, and she maintains that it\nhas done her much good.\nThe condensation _uclamparia\u2014wet_ is therefore the point of junction for\nthe dream as well as for the neurosis.[DO]\nIII. In a somewhat long and wild dream of my own, the chief point of\nwhich is apparently a sea voyage, it happens that the next landing is\ncalled _Hearsing_ and the one farther on _Fliess_. The latter is the\nname of my friend living in B., who has often been the objective point\nof my travels. But Hearsing is put together from the names of places in\nthe local environment of Vienna, which so often end in _ing_:\n_Hietzing_, _Liesing_, _Moedling_ (Medelitz, \u201cme\u00e6 delici\u00e6,\u201d my own name,\n\u201c_my joy_\u201d) (joy = German Freude), and the English _hearsay_, which\npoints to libel and establishes the relation to the indifferent dream\nexcitement of the day\u2014a poem in the _Fliegende Blaetter_ about a\nslanderous dwarf, \u201cSaidhe Hashesaid.\u201d By connecting the final syllable\n\u201c_ing_\u201d with the name _Fliess_, \u201c_Vlissingen_\u201d is obtained, which is a\nreal port on the sea-voyage which my brother passes when he comes to\nvisit us from England. But the English for _Vlissingen_ is _Flushing_,\nwhich signifies blushing and recalls erythrophobia (fear of blushing),\nwhich I treat, and also reminds me of a recent publication by Bechterew\nabout this neurosis, which has given occasion for angry feelings in me.\nIV. Upon another occasion I had a dream which consisted of two parts.\nThe first was the vividly remembered word \u201cAutodidasker,\u201d the second was\ntruthfully covered by a short and harmless fancy which had been\ndeveloped a few days before, and which was to the effect that I must\ntell Professor N., when I saw him next: \u201cThe patient about whose\ncondition I last consulted you is really suffering from a neurosis, just\nas you suspected.\u201d The coinage \u201c_Autodidasker_\u201d must, then, not only\nsatisfy the requirement that it should contain or represent a compressed\nmeaning, but also that this meaning should have a valid connection with\nmy purpose, which is repeated from waking life, of giving Professor N.\nhis due credit.\nNow _Autodidasker_ is easily separated into _author_ (German _Autor_),\n_autodidact_, and _Lasker_, with whom is associated the name Lasalle.\nThe first of these words leads to the occasion of the dream\u2014which this\ntime is significant. I had brought home to my wife several volumes by a\nwell-known author, who is a friend of my brother\u2019s, and who, as I have\nlearned, comes from the same town as I (J. J. David). One evening she\nspoke to me about the profound impression which the touching sadness of\na story in one of David\u2019s novels, about a talented but degenerate\nperson, had made upon her, and our conversation turned upon the\nindications of talent which we perceive in our own children. Under the\ninfluence of what she had just read, my wife expressed a concern\nrelative to our children, and I comforted her with the remark that it is\njust such dangers that can be averted by education. During the night my\ntrain of thoughts proceeded further, took up the concern of my wife, and\nconnected with it all sorts of other things. An opinion which the poet\nhad expressed to my brother upon the subject of marriage showed my\nthoughts a by-path which might lead to a representation in the dream.\nThis path led to Breslau, into which city a lady who was a very good\nfriend of ours had married. I found in Breslau Lasker and Lasalle as\nexamples realising our concern about being ruined at the hands of a\nwoman, examples which enabled me to represent both manifestations of\nthis influence for the bad at once.[DP] The \u201cCherchez la femme,\u201d in\nwhich these thoughts may be summed up, when taken in another sense,\nbrings me to my brother, who is still unmarried and whose name is\nAlexander. Now I see that Alex, as we abbreviate the name, sounds almost\nlike inversion of Lasker and that this factor must have taken part in\ngiving my thoughts their detour by way of Breslau.\nBut this playing with names and syllables in which I am here engaged\ncontains still another meaning. The wish that my brother may have a\nhappy family life is represented by it in the following manner. In the\nartistic romance _L\u2019\u0152uvre_, the writer, as is well known, has\nincidentally given an episodic account of himself and of his own family\nhappiness, and he appears under the name of _Sandoz_. Probably he has\ntaken the following course in the name transformation. _Zola_ when\ninverted (as children like so much to do) gives _Aloz_. But that was\nstill too undisguised for him; therefore he replaced the syllable _Al_,\nwhich stands at the beginning of the name Alexander, by the third\nsyllable of the same name, _sand_, and thus _Sandoz_ came about. In a\nsimilar manner my _autodidasker_ originated.\nMy fancy, that I am telling Professor N. that the patient whom we had\nboth seen is suffering from a neurosis, got into the dream in the\nfollowing manner. Shortly before the close of my working year I received\na patient in whose case my diagnosis failed me. A serious organic\naffliction\u2014perhaps some changes in the spine\u2014was to be assumed, but\ncould not be proved. It would have been tempting to diagnose the trouble\nas a neurosis, and this would have put an end to all difficulties, had\nit not been for the fact that the sexual anamnesis, without which I am\nunwilling to admit a neurosis, was so energetically denied by the\npatient. In my embarrassment I called to my assistance the physician\nwhom I respect most of all men (as others do also), and to whose\nauthority I surrender most completely. He listened to my doubts, told me\nhe thought them justified, and then said: \u201cKeep on observing the man, it\nis probably a neurosis.\u201d Since I know that he does not share my opinions\nabout the etiology of neuroses, I suppressed my disagreement, but I did\nnot conceal my scepticism. A few days after I informed the patient that\nI did not know what to do with him, and advised him to go to some one\nelse. Thereupon, to my great astonishment, he began to beg my pardon for\nhaving lied to me, saying that he had felt very much ashamed; and now he\nrevealed to me just that piece of sexual etiology which I had expected,\nand which I found necessary for assuming the existence of a neurosis.\nThis was a relief to me, but at the same time a humiliation; for I had\nto admit that my consultant, who was not disconcerted by the absence of\nanamnesis, had made a correct observation. I made up my mind to tell him\nabout it when I saw him again, and to say to him that he had been in the\nright and I in the wrong.\nThis is just what I do in the dream. But what sort of a wish is supposed\nto be fulfilled if I acknowledge that I am in the wrong? This is exactly\nmy wish; I wish to be in the wrong with my apprehensions\u2014that is to say,\nI wish that my wife whose fears I have appropriated in the dream\nthoughts may remain in the wrong. The subject to which the matter of\nbeing in the right or in the wrong is related in the dream is not far\ndistant from what is really interesting to the dream thoughts. It is the\nsame pair of alternatives of either organic or functional impairment\nthrough a woman, more properly through the sexual life\u2014either tabetic\nparalysis or a neurosis\u2014with which the manner of Lasalle\u2019s ruin is more\nor less loosely connected.\nIn this well-joined dream (which, however, is quite transparent with the\nhelp of careful analysis) Professor N. plays a part not merely on\naccount of this analogy and of my wish to remain in the wrong, or on\naccount of the associated references to Breslau and to the family of our\nfriend who is married there\u2014but also on account of the following little\noccurrence which was connected with our consultation. After he had\nattended to our medical task by giving the above mentioned suggestion,\nhis interest was directed to personal matters. \u201cHow many children have\nyou now?\u201d\u2014\u201cSix.\u201d\u2014A gesture of respect and reflection.\u2014\u201cGirls,\nboys?\u201d\u2014\u201cThree of each. They are my pride and my treasure.\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, there\nis no difficulty about the girls, but the boys give trouble later on in\ntheir education.\u201d I replied that until now they had been very tractable;\nthis second diagnosis concerning the future of my boys of course pleased\nme as little as the one he had made earlier, namely, that my patient had\nonly a neurosis. These two impressions, then, are bound together by\ncontiguity, by being successively received, and if I incorporate the\nstory of the neurosis into the dream, I substitute it for the\nconversation upon education which shows itself to be even more closely\nconnected with the dream thoughts owing to the fact that it has such an\nintimate bearing upon the subsequently expressed concerns of my wife.\nThus even my fear that N. may turn out to be right in his remarks on the\neducational difficulties in the case of boys is admitted into the dream\ncontent, in that it is concealed behind the representation of my wish\nthat I may be wrong in such apprehensions. The same fancy serves without\nchange to represent both conflicting alternatives.\nThe verbal compositions of the dream are very similar to those which are\nknown to occur in paranoia, but which are also found in hysteria and in\ncompulsive ideas. The linguistic habits of children, who at certain\nperiods actually treat words as objects and invent new languages and\nartificial syntaxes, are in this case the common source for the dream as\nwell as for psychoneuroses.\nWhen speeches occur in the dream, which are expressly distinguished from\nthoughts as such, it is an invariable rule that the dream speech has\noriginated from a remembered speech in the dream material. Either the\nwording has been preserved in its integrity, or it has been slightly\nchanged in the course of expression; frequently the dream speech is\npieced together from various recollections of speeches, while the\nwording has remained the same and the meaning has possibly been changed\nso as to have two or more significations. Not infrequently the dream\nspeech serves merely as an allusion to an incident, at which the\nrecollected speech occurred.[DQ]\n(_b_) _The Work of Displacement_\nAnother sort of relation, which is no less significant, must have come\nto our notice while we were collecting examples of dream condensation.\nWe have seen that those elements which obtrude themselves in the dream\ncontent as its essential components play a part in the dream thoughts\nwhich is by no means the same. As a correlative to this the converse of\nthis thesis is also true. That which is clearly the essential thing in\nthe dream thoughts need not be represented in the dream at all. The\ndream, as it were, is _eccentric_; its contents are grouped about other\nelements than the dream thoughts as a central point. Thus, for example,\nin the dream about the botanical monograph the central point of the\ndream content is apparently the element \u201cbotanical\u201d; in the dream\nthoughts we are concerned with the complications and conflicts which\nresult from services rendered among colleagues which put them under\nobligations to one another, subsequently with the reproach that I am in\nthe habit of sacrificing too much to my hobbies, and the element\n\u201cbotanical\u201d would in no case find a place in this nucleus of the dream\nthoughts if it were not loosely connected with it by an antithesis, for\nbotany was never among my favourite studies. In the Sappho dream of my\npatient the ascending and descending, being upstairs and down, is made\nthe central point; the dream, however, is concerned with the danger of\nsexual relations with persons of low _degree_, so that only one of the\nelements of the dream thoughts seems to have been taken over into the\ndream content, albeit with unseemly elaboration. Similarly in the dream\nabout June bugs, whose subject is the relation of sexuality to cruelty,\nthe factor of cruelty has indeed reappeared but in a different\nconnection and without the mention of the sexual, that is to say, it has\nbeen torn from its context and transformed into something strange.\nAgain, in the dream about my uncle, the blond beard, which seems to be\nits central point, appears to have no rational connection with the\nwishes for greatness which we have recognised as the nucleus of the\ndream thoughts. It is only to be expected if such dreams give a\ndisplaced impression. In complete contrast to these examples, the dream\nof Irma\u2019s injection shows that individual elements can claim the same\nplace in the formation of dreams which they occupy in the dream\nthoughts. The recognition of these new and entirely variable relations\nbetween the dream thoughts and the dream content is at first likely to\nexcite our astonishment. If we find in a psychic process of normal life\nthat an idea has been culled from among a number of others, and has\nacquired particular vividness in our consciousness, we are in the habit\nof regarding this result as a proof that the victorious idea is endowed\nwith a peculiarly high degree of psychic value\u2014a certain degree of\ninterest. We now discover that this value of the individual elements in\nthe dream thoughts is not preserved in the formation of the dream, or\ndoes not come into consideration. For there is no doubt as to the\nelements of the dream thoughts which are of the highest value; our\njudgment tells us immediately. In the formation of dreams those elements\nwhich are emphasized with intense interest may be treated as though they\nwere inferior, and other elements are put in their place which certainly\nwere inferior in the dream thoughts. We are at first given the\nimpression that the psychic intensity[DR] of the individual ideas does\nnot come into consideration at all for the selection made by the dream,\nbut only their greater or smaller multiplicity of determination. Not\nwhat is important in the dream thoughts gets into the dream, but what is\ncontained in them several times over, one might be inclined to think;\nbut our understanding of the formation of dreams is not much furthered\nby this assumption, for at the outset it will be impossible to believe\nthat the two factors of manifold determination and of integral value do\nnot tend in the same direction in the influence they exert on the\nselection made by the dream. Those ideas in the dream thoughts which are\nmost important are probably also those which recur most frequently, for\nthe individual dream thoughts radiate from them as from central points.\nAnd still the dream may reject those elements which are especially\nemphasized and which receive manifold support, and may take up into its\ncontent elements which are endowed only with the latter property.\nThis difficulty may be solved by considering another impression received\nin the investigation of the manifold determination of the dream content.\nPerhaps many a reader has already passed his own judgment upon this\ninvestigation by saying that the manifold determination of the elements\nof the dream is not a significant discovery, because it is a\nself-evident one. In the analysis one starts from the dream elements,\nand registers all the notions which are connected with them; it is no\nwonder, then, that these elements should occur with particular frequency\nin the thought material which is obtained in this manner. I cannot\nacknowledge the validity of this objection, but shall say something\nmyself which sounds like it. Among the thoughts which analysis brings to\nlight, many can be found which are far removed from the central idea of\nthe dream, and which appear distinguished from the rest as artificial\ninterpolations for a definite purpose. Their purpose may easily be\ndiscovered; they are just the ones which establish a connection, often a\nforced and far-fetched one, between the dream content and the dream\nthoughts, and if these elements were to be weeded out, not only\nover-determination but also a sufficient determination by means of the\ndream thoughts would often be lacking for the dream content. We are thus\nled to the conclusion that manifold determination, which decides the\nselection made by the dream, is perhaps not always a primary factor in\ndream formation, but is often the secondary manifestation of a psychic\npower which is still unknown to us. But in spite of all this, manifold\ndetermination must nevertheless control the entrance of individual\nelements into the dream, for it is possible to observe that it is\nestablished with considerable effort in cases where it does not result\nfrom the dream material without assistance.\nThe assumption is not now far distant that a psychic force is expressed\nin dream activity which on the one hand strips elements of high psychic\nvalue of their intensity, and which on the other hand creates new\nvalues, _by way of over-determination_, from elements of small value,\nthese new values subsequently getting into the dream content. If this is\nthe method of procedure, there has taken place in the formation of the\ndream a transference and displacement of the psychic intensities of the\nindividual elements, of which the textual difference between the dream\nand the thought content appears as a result. The process which we assume\nhere is nothing less than the essential part of the dream activity; it\nmerits the designation of _dream displacement_. _Dream displacement_ and\n_dream condensation_ are the two craftsmen to whom we may chiefly\nattribute the moulding of the dream.\nI think we also have an easy task in recognising the psychic force which\nmakes itself felt in the circumstances of dream displacement. The result\nof this displacement is that the dream content no longer resembles the\ncore of the dream thoughts at all, and that the dream reproduces only a\ndisfigured form of the dream-wish in the unconscious. But we are already\nacquainted with dream disfigurement; we have traced it back to the\ncensorship which one psychic instance in the psychic life exercises upon\nthe other. Dream displacement is one of the chief means for achieving\nthis disfigurement. _Is fecit, cui profuit._ We may assume that dream\ndisplacement is brought about by the influence of this censor, of the\nendopsychic repulsion.[DS]\nThe manner in which the factors of displacement, condensation, and\nover-determination play into one another in the formation of the dream,\nwhich is the ruling factor and which the subordinate one, all this will\nbe reserved as the subject of later investigations. For the present we\nmay state, as a second condition which the elements must satisfy in\norder to get into the dream, that _they must be withdrawn from the\ncensor of resistance_. From now on we shall take account of dream\ndisplacement as an unquestionable fact in the interpretation of dreams.\n(_c_) _Means of Representation in the Dream_\nBesides the two factors of dream condensation and dream displacement\nwhich we have found to be active in the transformation of the latent\ndream material into the manifest content, we shall come in the course of\nthis investigation upon two other conditions which exercise an\nunquestionable influence upon the selection of the material which gets\ninto the dream. Even at the risk of seeming to stop our progress, I\nshould like to glance at the processes by which the interpretation of\ndreams is accomplished. I do not deny that I should succeed best in\nmaking them clear, and in showing that they are sufficiently reliable to\ninsure them against attack, by taking a single dream as a paradigm and\ndeveloping its interpretation, as I have done in Chapter II. in the\ndream of \u201cIrma\u2019s Injection,\u201d and then putting together the dream\nthoughts which I have discovered, and reconstructing the formation of\nthe dream from them\u2014that is to say, by supplementing the analysis of\ndreams by a synthesis of them. I have accomplished this with several\nspecimens for my own instruction; but I cannot undertake to do it here\nbecause I am prevented by considerations, which every right-minded\nperson must approve of, relative to the psychic material necessary for\nsuch a demonstration. In the analysis of dreams these considerations\npresent less difficulty, for an analysis may be incomplete and still\nretain its value even if it leads only a short way into the thought\nlabyrinth of the dream. I do not see how a synthesis could be anything\nshort of complete in order to be convincing. I could give a complete\nsynthesis only of the dreams of such persons as are unknown to the\nreading public. Since, however, only neurotic patients furnish me with\nthe means for doing this, this part of the description of the dream must\nbe postponed until I can carry the psychological explanation of neuroses\nfar enough\u2014elsewhere\u2014to be able to show their connection with the\nsubject matter under consideration.[DT]\nFrom my attempts synthetically to construct dreams from the dream\nthoughts, I know that the material which is obtained from interpretation\nvaries in value. For a part of it consists of the essential dream\nthoughts which would, therefore, completely replace the dream, and which\nwould in themselves be sufficient for this replacement if there were no\ncensor for the dream. The other part may be summed up under the term\n\u201ccollaterals\u201d; taken as a whole they represent the means by which the\nreal wish that arises from the dream thoughts is transformed into the\ndream-wish. A first part of these \u201ccollaterals\u201d consists of allusions to\nthe actual dream thoughts, which, considered schematically, correspond\nto displacements from the essential to the non-essential. A second part\ncomprises the thoughts which connect these non-essential elements, that\nhave become significant through displacement with one another, and which\nreach from them into the dream content. Finally a third part contains\nthe ideas and thought connections which (in the work of interpretation)\nconduct us from the dream content to the intermediary collaterals, _all\nof which_ need not _necessarily_ have participated in the formation of\nthe dream.\nAt this point we are interested exclusively in the essential dream\nthoughts. These are usually found to be a complex of thoughts and\nmemories of the most intricate possible construction, and to possess all\nthe properties of the thought processes which are known to us from\nwaking life. Not infrequently they are trains of thought which proceed\nfrom more than one centre, but which do not lack points of connection;\nalmost regularly a chain of thought stands next to its contradictory\ncorrelative, being connected with it by contrast associations.\nThe individual parts of this complicated structure naturally stand in\nthe most manifold logical relations to one another. They constitute a\nforeground or background, digressions, illustrations, conditions, chains\nof argument, and objections. When the whole mass of these dream thoughts\nis subjected to the pressure of the dream activity, during which the\nparts are turned about, broken up, and pushed together, something like\ndrifting ice, there arises the question, what becomes of the logical\nties which until now had given form to the structure? What\nrepresentation do \u201cif,\u201d \u201cbecause,\u201d \u201cas though,\u201d \u201calthough,\u201d \u201ceither\u2014or,\u201d\nand all the other conjunctions, without which we cannot understand a\nphrase or a sentence, receive in the dream?\nAt first we must answer that the dream has at its disposal no means for\nrepresenting these logical relations among the dream thoughts. In most\ncases it disregards all these conjunctions, and undertakes the\nelaboration only of the objective content of the dream thoughts. It is\nleft to the interpretation of the dream to restore the coherence which\nthe activity of the dream has destroyed.\nIf the dream lacks ability to express these relations, the psychic\nmaterial of which the dream is wrought must be responsible. The\ndescriptive arts are limited in the same manner\u2014painting and the plastic\narts in comparison with poetry, which can employ speech; and here too\nthe reason for this impotence is to be found in the material in the\ntreatment of which the two arts strive to give expression to something.\nBefore the art of painting had arrived at an understanding of the laws\nof expression by which it is bound, it attempted to escape this\ndisadvantage. In old paintings little tags were hung from the mouths of\nthe persons represented giving the speech, the expression of which in\nthe picture the artist despaired of.\nPerhaps an objection will here be raised challenging the assertion that\nthe dream dispenses with the representation of logical relations. There\nare dreams in which the most complicated intellectual operations take\nplace, in which proof and refutation are offered, puns and comparisons\nmade, just as in waking thoughts. But here, too, appearances are\ndeceitful; if the interpretation of such dreams is pursued, it is found\nthat all of this is _dream material, not the representation of\nintellectual activity in the dream_. The _content_ of the dream thoughts\nis reproduced by the apparent thinking of the dream, not _the relations\nof the dream thoughts to one another_, in the determination of which\nrelations thinking consists. I shall give examples of this. But the\nthesis which is most easily established is that all speeches which occur\nin the dream, and which are expressly designated as such, are unchanged\nor only slightly modified copies of speeches which are likewise to be\nfound in the recollections of the dream material. Often the speech is\nonly an allusion to an event contained in the dream thoughts; the\nmeaning of the dream is a quite different one.\nI shall not deny, indeed, that there is also critical thought activity\nwhich does not merely repeat material from the dream thoughts and which\ntakes part in the formation of the dream. I shall have to explain the\ninfluence of this factor at the close of this discussion. It will then\nbecome clear that this thought activity is evoked not by the dream\nthoughts, but by the dream itself after it is already finished in a\ncertain sense.\nWe shall, therefore, consider it settled for the present that the\nlogical relations among the dream thoughts do not enjoy any particular\nrepresentation in the dream. For instance, where there is a\ncontradiction in the dream, this is either a contradiction directed\nagainst the dream itself or a contradiction derived from the content of\none of the dream thoughts; a contradiction in the dream corresponds to a\ncontradiction _among_ the dream thoughts only in a highly indirect\nmanner.\nBut just as the art of painting finally succeeded in depicting in the\nrepresented persons, at least their intention in speaking\u2014their\ntenderness, threatening attitude, warning mien, and the like\u2014by other\nmeans than the dangling tag, so also the dream has found it possible to\nrender account of a few of the logical relations among its dream\nthoughts by means of an appropriate modification of the peculiar method\nof dream representation. It will be found by experience that different\ndreams go to different lengths in taking this into consideration; while\none dream entirely disregards the logical coherence of its material,\nanother attempts to indicate it as completely as possible. In so doing\nthe dream departs more or less widely from the subject-matter which it\nis to elaborate. The dream also takes a similarly varying attitude\ntowards the temporal coherence of the dream thoughts, if such coherence\nhas been established in the unconscious (as for example in the dream of\nIrma\u2019s injection).\nBut what are the means by which the dream activity is enabled to\nindicate these relations in the dream material which are so difficult to\nrepresent? I shall attempt to enumerate these separately.\nIn the first place, the dream renders account of the connection which is\nundeniably present between all the parts of the dream thoughts by\nuniting this material in a single composition as a situation or process.\nIt reproduces _logical connection in the form of simultaneousness_; in\nthis case it acts something like the painter who groups together all the\nphilosophers or poets into a picture of the school of Athens or of\nParnassus, although these were never at once present in any hall or on\nany mountain top\u2014though they do, however, form a unity from the point of\nview of reflective contemplation.\nThe dream carries out this method of representation in detail. Whenever\nit shows two elements close together, it vouches for a particularly\nintimate connection between those elements which correspond to them in\nthe dream thoughts. It is as in our method of writing: _to_ signifies\nthat the two letters are to be pronounced as one syllable, while _t_\nwith _o_ after a free space shows that _t_ is the last letter of one\nword and _o_ the first letter of another. According to this, dream\ncombinations are not made of arbitrary, completely incongruent elements\nof the dream material, but of elements that also have a somewhat\nintimate relation to one another in the dream thoughts.\nFor representing causal relation the dream has two methods, which are\nessentially reducible to one. The more frequent method, in cases, for\nexample, where the dream thoughts are to the effect: \u201cBecause this was\nso and so, this and that must happen,\u201d consists in making the premise an\nintroductory dream and joining the conclusion to it in the form of the\nmain dream. If my interpretation is correct, the sequence may also be\nreversed. That part of the dream which is more completely worked out\nalways corresponds to the conclusion.\nA female patient, whose dream I shall later give in full, once furnished\nme with a neat example of such a representation of causal relationship.\nThe dream consisted of a short prologue and of a very elaborate but well\norganised dream composition, which might be entitled: \u201cA flower of\nspeech.\u201d The prologue of the dream is as follows: _She goes to the two\nmaids in the kitchen and scolds them for taking so long to prepare \u201ca\nlittle bite of food.\u201d She also sees a great many coarse dishes standing\nin the kitchen, inverted so that the water may drop off them, and heaped\nup in a pile. The two maids go to fetch water, and must, as it were,\nstep into a river, which reaches up to the house or into the yard._\nThen follows the main dream, which begins as follows: _She is descending\nfrom a high place, over balustrades that are curiously fashioned, and\nshe is glad that her dress doesn\u2019t get caught anywhere_, &c. Now the\nintroductory dream refers to the house of the lady\u2019s parents. Probably\nshe has often heard from her mother the words which are spoken in the\nkitchen. The piles of unwashed dishes are taken from an unpretentious\nearthenware shop which was located in the same house. The second part of\nthis dream contains an allusion to the dreamer\u2019s father, who always had\na great deal to do with servant girls, and who later contracted a fatal\ndisease during a flood\u2014the house stood near the bank of a river. The\nthought which is concealed behind the introductory dream, then, is to\nthis effect: \u201cBecause I was born in this house, under such limited and\nunlovely circumstances.\u201d The main dream takes up the same thought, and\npresents it in a form that has been altered by the tendency to\nwish-fulfilment: \u201cI am of exalted origin.\u201d Properly then: \u201cBecause I was\nborn in such low circumstances, my career has been so and so.\u201d\nAs far as I can see, the partition of a dream into two unequal portions\ndoes not always signify a causal relation between the thoughts of the\ntwo portions. It often appears as though the same material were being\npresented in the two dreams from different points of view; or as though\nthe two dreams have proceeded from two separated centres in the dream\nmaterial and their contents overlap, so that the object which is the\ncentre of one dream has served in the other as an allusion, and _vice\nversa_. But in a certain number of cases a division into shorter\nfore-dreams and longer subsequent dreams actually signifies a causal\nrelation between the two portions. The other method of representing\ncausal relation is used with less abundant material and consists in the\nchange of one image in the dream, whether a person or a thing, into\nanother. It is only in cases where we witness this change taking place\nin the dream that any causal relation is asserted to exist, not where we\nmerely notice that one thing has taken the place of another. I said that\nboth methods of representing causal relation are reducible to the same\nthing; in both cases _causation_ is represented by a _succession_, now\nby the sequence of the dreams, now by the immediate transformation of\none image into another. In the great majority of cases, of course,\ncausal relation is not expressed at all, but is obliterated by the\nsequence of elements which is unavoidable in the dream process.\nThe dream is altogether unable to express the alternative, \u201ceither\u2014or\u201d;\nit is in the habit of taking both members of this alternative into one\ncontext, as though they were equally privileged. A classic example of\nthis is contained in the dream of Irma\u2019s injection. Its latent thoughts\nobviously mean: I am innocent of the continued presence of Irma\u2019s pains;\nthe fault rests either with her resistance to accepting the solution,\n_or_ with the fact that she is living under unfavourable sexual\nconditions, which I am unable to change, _or_ her pains are not of a\nhysteric nature at all, but organic. The dream, however, fulfils all\nthese possibilities, which are almost exclusive, and is quite ready to\nextract from the dream-wish an additional fourth solution of this kind.\nAfter interpreting the dream I have therefore inserted the _either\u2014or_\nin the sequence of the dream thoughts.\nIn the case where the dreamer finds occasion in telling the dream to use\n_either\u2014or_: \u201cIt was either a garden or a living-room,\u201d &c., it is not\nreally an alternative which occurs in the dream thoughts, but an \u201cand,\u201d\na simple addition. When we use _either\u2014or_ we are usually describing a\ncharacteristic of indistinctness belonging to an element of the dream\nwhich is still capable of being cleared up. The rule of interpretation\nfor this case is as follows: The separate members of the alternative are\nto be treated as equals and connected by \u201cand.\u201d For instance, after\nwaiting for a long time in vain for the address of my friend who is\nliving in Italy, I dream that I receive a telegram which tells me this\naddress. Upon the strip of telegraph paper I see printed in blue the\nfollowing; the first word is blurred:\nperhaps _via_,\nor _villa_, the second is distinctly: _Sezerno_ or perhaps (_Casa_).\nThe second word, which sounds like an Italian name and which reminds me\nof our etymological discussions, also expresses my displeasure on\naccount of the fact that my friend has kept his place of residence\nsecret from me for so long a time; every member of the triple suggestion\nfor the first word may be recognised in the course of analysis as a\nself-sufficient and equally well-justified starting point in the\nconcatenation of ideas.\nDuring the night before the funeral of my father I dreamed of a printed\nplacard, a card or poster\u2014perhaps something like signs in railway\nwaiting-rooms which announce the prohibition of smoking\u2014which reads\neither:\n_It is requested to shut the eyes_\nor\n_It is requested to shut an eye_\nwhich I am in the habit of representing in the following form:\n_the_\n_It is requested to shut_       _eye(s)._\n_an_\nEach of the two variations has its own particular meaning, and leads us\nalong particular paths in the interpretation of the dream. I had made\nthe simplest kind of funeral arrangements, for I knew how the deceased\nthought about such matters. Other members of the family, however, did\nnot approve of such puritanic simplicity; they thought we would have to\nbe ashamed before the mourners. Hence one of the wordings of the dream\nrequests the \u201cshutting of one eye,\u201d that is to say, that people should\nshow consideration. The significance of the blurring, which we describe\nwith an _either\u2014or_, may here be seen with particular ease. The dream\nactivity has not succeeded in constructing a unified but at the same\ntime ambiguous wording for the dream thoughts. Thus the two main trains\nof thought are already distinguished even in the dream content.\nIn a few cases the division of the dream into two equal parts expresses\nthe alternative which the dream finds it so difficult to represent.\nThe attitude of the dream towards the category of antithesis and\ncontradiction is most striking. This category is unceremoniously\nneglected; the word \u201cNo\u201d does not seem to exist for the dream.\nAntitheses are with peculiar preference reduced to unity or represented\nas one. The dream also takes the liberty of representing any element\nwhatever by its desired opposite, so that it is at first impossible to\ntell about any element capable of having an opposite, whether it is to\nbe taken negatively or positively, in the dream thoughts.[DU] In one of\nthe last-mentioned dreams, whose introductory portion we have already\ninterpreted (\u201cbecause my parentage is such\u201d), the dreamer descends over\na balustrade and holds a blossoming twig in her hands. Since this\npicture suggests to her the angel in paintings of the Annunciation (her\nown name is Mary) carrying a lily stem in his hand, and the white-robed\ngirls marching in the procession on Corpus Christi Day when the streets\nare decorated with green bows, the blossoming twig in the dream is very\ncertainly an allusion to sexual innocence. But the twig is thickly\nstudded with red blossoms, each one of which resembles a camelia. At the\nend of her walk, so the dream continues, the blossoms have already\nfallen considerably apart; then unmistakable allusions to menstruation\nfollow. But this very twig which is carried like a lily and as though by\nan innocent girl, is also an allusion to Camille, who, as is known,\nalways wore a white camelia, but a red one at the time of her\nmenstruation. The same blossoming twig (\u201cthe flower of maidenhood\u201d in\nthe songs about the miller\u2019s daughter by Goethe) represents at once\nsexual innocence and its opposite. The same dream, also, which expresses\nthe dreamer\u2019s joy at having succeeded in passing through life unsullied,\nhints in several places (as at the falling-off of the blossom), at the\nopposite train of thought\u2014namely, that she had been guilty of various\nsins against sexual purity (that is in her childhood). In the analysis\nof the dream we may clearly distinguish the two trains of thought, of\nwhich the comforting one seems to be superficial, the reproachful one\nmore profound. The two are diametrically opposed to each other, and\ntheir like but contrasting elements have been represented by the\nidentical dream elements.\nThe mechanism of dream formation is favourable in the highest degree to\nonly one of the logical relations. This relation is that of similarity,\ncorrespondence, contiguity, \u201cas though,\u201d which is capable of being\nrepresented in the dream as no other can be, by the most varied\nexpedients. The correspondences occurring in the dream, or cases of \u201cas\nthough,\u201d are the chief points of support for the formation of dreams,\nand no inconsiderable part of the dream activity consists in creating\nnew correspondences of this sort in cases where those which are already\nat hand are prevented by the censor of resistance from getting into the\ndream. The effort towards condensation shown by the dream activity\nassists in the representation of the relation of similarity.\n_Similarity_, _agreement_, _community_, are quite generally expressed in\nthe dream by concentration into a _unity_, which is either already found\nin the dream material or is newly created. The first case may be\nreferred to as _identification_, the second as _composition_.\nIdentification is used where the dream is concerned with persons,\ncomposition where things are the objects of unification; but\ncompositions are also made from persons. Localities are often treated as\npersons.\nIdentification consists in giving representation in the dream content to\nonly one of a number of persons who are connected by some common\nfeature, while the second or the other persons seem to be suppressed as\nfar as the dream is concerned. This one representative person in the\ndream enters into all the relations and situations which belong to\nitself or to the persons who are covered by it. In cases of composition,\nhowever, when this has to do with persons, there are already present in\nthe dream image features which are characteristic of, but not common to,\nthe persons in question, so that a new unity, a composite person,\nappears as the result of the union of these features. The composition\nitself may be brought about in various ways. Either the dream person\nbears the name of one of the persons to whom it refers\u2014and then we know,\nin a manner which is quite analogous to knowledge in waking life, that\nthis or that person is the one who is meant\u2014while the visual features\nbelong to another person; or the dream image itself is composed of\nvisual features which in reality are shared by both. Instead of visual\nfeatures, also, the part played by the second person may be represented\nby the mannerisms which are usually ascribed to him, the words which he\nusually speaks, or the situations in which he is usually imagined. In\nthe latter method of characterisation the sharp distinction between\nidentification and composition of persons begins to disappear. But it\nmay also happen that the formation of such a mixed personality is\nunsuccessful. The situation of the dream is then attributed to one\nperson, and the other\u2014as a rule the more important one\u2014is introduced as\nan inactive and unconcerned spectator. The dreamer relates something\nlike \u201cMy mother was also there\u201d (Stekel).\nThe common feature which justifies the union of the two persons\u2014that is\nto say, which is the occasion for it\u2014may either be represented in the\ndream or be absent. As a rule, identification or composition of persons\nsimply serves the purpose of dispensing with the representation of this\ncommon feature. Instead of repeating: \u201cA is ill disposed towards me, and\nB is also,\u201d I make a composite person of A and B in the dream, or I\nconceive A as doing an unaccustomed action which usually characterises\nB. The dream person obtained in this way appears in the dream in some\nnew connection, and the fact that it signifies both A and B justifies me\nin inserting that which is common to both\u2014their hostility towards me\u2014at\nthe proper place in the interpretation of the dream. In this manner I\noften achieve a very extraordinary degree of condensation of the dream\ncontent; I can save myself the direct representation of very complicated\nrelations belonging to a person, if I can find a second person who has\nan equal claim to a part of these relations. It is also obvious to what\nextent this representation by means of identification can circumvent the\nresisting censor, which makes the dream activity conform to such harsh\nconditions. That which offends the censor may lie in those very ideas\nwhich are connected in the dream material with the one person; I now\nfind a second person, who likewise has relation to the objectionable\nmaterial, but only to a part of it. The contact in that one point which\noffends the censor now justified me in forming a composite person, which\nis characterised on either hand by indifferent features. This person\nresulting from composition or identification, who is unobjectionable to\nthe censor, is now suited for incorporation in the dream content, and by\nthe application of dream condensation I have satisfied the demands of\nthe dream censor.\nIn dreams where a common feature of two persons is represented, this is\nusually a hint to look for another concealed common feature, the\nrepresentation of which is made impossible by the censor. A displacement\nof the common feature has here taken place partly in order to facilitate\nrepresentation. From the circumstance that the composite person appears\nto me with an indifferent common feature, I must infer that another\ncommon feature which is by no means indifferent exists in the dream\nthoughts.\nAccording to what has been said, identification or composition of\npersons serves various purposes in the dream; in the first place, to\nrepresent a feature common to the two persons; secondly, to represent a\ndisplaced common feature; and thirdly, even to give expression to a\ncommunity of features that is merely _wished for_. As the wish for a\ncommunity between two persons frequently coincides with the exchanging\nof these persons, this relation in the dream is also expressed through\nidentification. In the dream of Irma\u2019s injection I wish to exchange this\npatient for another\u2014that is to say, I wish the latter to be my patient\nas the former has been; the dream takes account of this wish by showing\nme a person who is called Irma, but who is examined in a position such\nas I have had the opportunity of seeing only when occupied with the\nother person in question. In the dream about my uncle this substitution\nis made the centre of the dream; I identify myself with the minister by\njudging and treating my colleague as shabbily as he does.\nIt has been my experience\u2014and to this I have found no exception\u2014that\nevery dream treats of one\u2019s own person. Dreams are absolutely egotistic.\nIn cases where not my ego, but only a strange person occurs in the dream\ncontent, I may safely assume that my ego is concealed behind that person\nby means of identification. I am permitted to supplement my ego. On\nother occasions when my ego appears in the dream, I am given to\nunderstand by the situation in which it is placed that another person is\nconcealing himself behind the ego. In this case the dream is intended to\ngive me notice that in the interpretation I must transfer something\nwhich is connected with this person\u2014the hidden common feature\u2014to myself.\nThere are also dreams in which my ego occurs along with other persons\nwhich the resolution of the identification again shows to be my ego. By\nmeans of this identification I am instructed to unite in my ego certain\nideas to whose acceptance the censor has objected. I may also give my\nego manifold representation in the dream, now directly, now by means of\nidentification with strangers. An extraordinary amount of thought\nmaterial may be condensed by means of a few such identifications.[DV]\nThe resolution of the identification of localities designated under\ntheir own names is even less difficult than that of persons, because\nhere the disturbing influence of the ego, which is all-powerful in the\ndream, is lacking. In one of my dreams about Rome (p. 164) the name of\nthe place in which I find myself is Rome; I am surprised, however, at\nthe great number of German placards at a street corner. The latter is a\nwish-fulfilment, which immediately suggests Prague; the wish itself\nprobably originated at a period in my youth when I was imbued with a\nGerman nationalistic spirit which is suppressed to-day. At the time of\nmy dream I was looking forward to meeting a friend in Prague; the\nidentification of Rome and Prague is thus to be explained by means of a\ndesired common feature; I would rather meet my friend in Rome than in\nPrague, I should like to exchange Prague for Rome for the purpose of\nthis meeting.\nThe possibility of creating compositions is one of the chief causes of\nthe phantastic character so common in dreams, in that it introduces into\nthe dream elements which could never have been the objects of\nperception. The psychic process which occurs in the formation of\ncompositions is obviously the same which we employ in conceiving or\nfashioning a centaur or a dragon in waking life. The only difference is\nthat in the phantastic creations occurring in waking life the intended\nimpression to be made by the new creation is itself the deciding factor,\nwhile the composition of the dream is determined by an influence\u2014the\ncommon feature in the dream thoughts\u2014which is independent of the form of\nthe image. The composition of the dream may be accomplished in a great\nmany different ways. In the most artless method of execution the\nproperties of the one thing are represented, and this representation is\naccompanied by the knowledge that they also belong to another object. A\nmore careful technique unites the features of one object with those of\nthe other in a new image, while it makes skilful use of resemblance\nbetween the two objects which exist in reality. The new creation may\nturn out altogether absurd or only phantastically ingenious, according\nto the subject-matter and the wit operative in the work of composition.\nIf the objects to be condensed into a unity are too incongruous, the\ndream activity is content with creating a composition with a\ncomparatively distinct nucleus, to which are attached less distinct\nmodifications. The unification into one image has here been\nunsuccessful, as it were; the two representations overlap and give rise\nto something like a contest between visual images. If attempt were made\nto construct an idea out of individual images of perception, similar\nrepresentations might be obtained in a drawing.\nDreams naturally abound in such compositions; several examples of these\nI have given in the dreams already analysed; I shall add more. In the\ndream on p. 296, which describes the career of my patient \u201cin flowery\nlanguage,\u201d the dream ego carries a blossoming twig in her hand, which,\nas we have seen, signifies at once innocence and sexual transgression.\nMoreover, the twig recalls cherry-blossoms on account of the manner in\nwhich the blossoms are clustered; the blossoms themselves, separately\nconsidered, are camelias, and finally the whole thing also gives the\nimpression of an _exotic_ plant. The common feature in the elements of\nthis composition is shown by the dream thoughts. The blossoming twig is\nmade up of allusions to presents by which she was induced or should have\nbeen induced to show herself agreeable. So it was with the cherries in\nher childhood and with the stem of camelias in her later years; the\nexotic feature is an illusion to a much-travelled naturalist, who sought\nto win her favour by means of a drawing of a flower. Another female\npatient creates a middle element out of bath-houses at a bathing resort,\nrural outside water-closets, and the garrets of our city dwellings. The\nreference to human nakedness and exposure is common to the two first\nelements; and we may infer from their connection with the third element\nthat (in her childhood) the garret was likewise the scene of exposure. A\ndreamer of the male sex makes a composite locality out of two places in\nwhich \u201ctreatment\u201d is given\u2014my office and the public hall in which he\nfirst became acquainted with his wife. Another female patient, after her\nelder brother has promised to regale her with caviare, dreams that his\nlegs are covered thick with black caviare pearls. The two elements,\n\u201ccontagion\u201d in a moral sense and the recollection of a cutaneous\neruption in childhood which made her legs look as though studded over\nwith red dots instead of black ones, have here been united with the\ncaviare pearls to form a new idea\u2014the idea of \u201cwhat she has inherited\nfrom her brother.\u201d In this dream parts of the human body are treated as\nobjects, as is usually the case in dreams. In one of the dreams reported\nby Ferenczi[87] there occurred a composition made up of the person of a\nphysician and a horse, over which was spread a night-shirt. The common\nfeature in these three components was shown in the analysis after the\nnight-shirt had been recognised as an allusion to the father of the\ndreamer in an infantile scene. In each of the three cases there was some\nobject of her sexual inquisitiveness. As a child she had often been\ntaken by her nurse to the military breeding station, where she had the\namplest opportunity to satisfy her curiosity, which was at that time\nuninhibited.\nI have already asserted that the dream has no means for expressing the\nrelation of contradiction, of contrast, of negation. I am about to\ncontradict this assertion for the first time. A part of the cases, which\nmay be summed up under the word \u201ccontrast,\u201d finds representation, as we\nhave seen, simply by means of identification\u2014that is, when an\ninterchange or replacement can be connected with the contrast. We have\ngiven repeated examples of this. Another part of the contrasts in the\ndream thoughts, which perhaps falls into the category \u201cturned into the\nopposite,\u201d is represented in the dream in the following remarkable\nmanner, which may almost be designated as witty. The \u201c_inversion_\u201d does\nnot itself get into the dream content, but manifests its presence there\nby means of the fact that a part of the already formed dream\ncontent which lies at hand for other reasons, is\u2014as it were\nsubsequently\u2014inverted. It is easier to illustrate this process than to\ndescribe it. In the beautiful \u201cUp and Down\u201d dream (p. 267) the\nrepresentation of ascending is an inversion of a prototype in the dream\nthoughts, that is to say, of the introductory scene of Daudet\u2019s\n_Sappho_; in the dream climbing is difficult at first, and easy later\non, while in the actual scene it is easy at first, and later becomes\nmore and more difficult. Likewise \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d in relation to the\ndreamer\u2019s brother are inverted in the dream. This points to a relation\nof contraries or contrasts as obtaining between two parts of the\nsubject-matter of the dream thoughts and the relation we have found in\nthe fact that in the childish fancy of the dreamer he is carried by his\nnurse, while in the novel, on the contrary, the hero carries his\nbeloved. My dream about Goethe\u2019s attack upon Mr. M. (p. 345) also\ncontains an \u201cinversion\u201d of this sort, which must first be set right\nbefore the interpretation of the dream can be accomplished. In the dream\nGoethe attacks a young man, Mr. M.; in reality, according to the dream\nthoughts, an eminent man, my friend, has been attacked by an unknown\nyoung author. In the dream I reckon time from the date of Goethe\u2019s\ndeath; in reality the reckoning was made from the year in which the\nparalytic was born. The thought determining the dream material is shown\nto be an objection to the treatment of Goethe as a lunatic. \u201cThe other\nway around,\u201d says the dream; \u201cif you cannot understand the book, it is\nyou who are dull-witted, not the author.\u201d Furthermore, all these dreams\nof inversion seem to contain a reference to the contemptuous phrase, \u201cto\nturn one\u2019s back upon a person\u201d (German: \u201ceinen die Kehrseite zeigen\u201d;\n_cf._ the inversion in respect to the dreamer\u2019s brother in the _Sappho_\ndream). It is also remarkable how frequently inversion becomes necessary\nin dreams which are inspired by repressed homosexual feelings.\nMoreover, inversion or transformation into an opposite is one of the\nfavourite methods of representation, and one of the methods most capable\nof varied application which the dream activity possesses. Its first\nfunction is to create the fulfilment of a wish with reference to a\ndefinite element of the dream-thoughts. \u201cIf it were only just the other\nway!\u201d is often the best expression of the relation of the ego to a\ndisagreeable recollection. But inversion becomes extraordinarily useful\nfor the purposes of the censor, for it brings about in the material\nrepresented a degree of disfiguration which all but paralyses our\nunderstanding of the dream. For this reason it is always permissible, in\ncases where the dream stubbornly refuses to yield its meaning, to try\nthe inversion of definite portions of its manifest content, whereupon\nnot infrequently everything becomes clear.\nBesides this inversion, the subject-matter inversion in temporal\nrelation is not to be overlooked. A frequent device of dream\ndisfigurement consists in presenting the final issue of an occurrence or\nthe conclusion of an argument at the beginning of the dream, or in\nsupplying the premises of a conclusion or the causes of an effect at the\nend of it. Any one who has not considered this technical method of dream\ndisfigurement stands helpless before the problem of dream\ninterpretation.[DW]\nIndeed in some cases we can obtain the sense of the dream only by\nsubjecting the dream content to manifold inversion in different\ndirections. For example, in the dream of a young patient suffering from\na compulsion neurosis, the memory of an infantile death-wish against a\ndreaded father was hidden behind the following words: _His father\nupbraids him because he arrives so late._ But the context in the\npsychoanalytic treatment and the thoughts of the dreamer alike go to\nshow that the sentence must read as follows: _He is angry at his\nfather_, and, further, that his father is always coming home _too early_\n(_i.e._ too soon). He would have preferred that his father should not\ncome home at all, which is identical with the wish (see page 219) that\nhis father should die. As a little boy the dreamer was guilty of sexual\naggression against another person while his father was away, and he was\nthreatened with punishment in the words: \u201cJust wait until father comes\nhome.\u201d\nIf we attempt to trace the relations between dream content and dream\nthoughts further, we shall do this best by making the dream itself our\nstarting-point and by asking ourselves the question: What do certain\nformal characteristics of dream representation signify with reference to\nthe dream thoughts? The formal characteristics which must attract our\nattention in the dream primarily include variations in the distinctness\nof individual parts of the dream or of whole dreams in relation to one\nanother. The variations in the intensity of individual dream images\ninclude a whole scale of degrees ranging from a distinctness of\ndepiction which one is inclined to rate as higher\u2014without warrant, to be\nsure\u2014than that of reality, to a provoking indistinctness which is\ndeclared to be characteristic of the dream, because it cannot altogether\nbe compared to any degree of indistinctness which we ever see in real\nobjects. Moreover, we usually designate the impression which we get from\nan indistinct object in the dream as \u201cfleeting,\u201d while we think of the\nmore distinct dream images as remaining intact for a longer period of\nperception. We must now ask ourselves by what conditions in the dream\nmaterial these differences in the vividness of the different parts of\nthe dream content are brought about.\nThere are certain expectations which will inevitably arise at this point\nand which must be met. Owing to the fact that real sensations during\nsleep may form part of the material of the dream, it will probably be\nassumed that these sensations or the dream elements resulting from them\nare emphasized by peculiar intensity, or conversely, that what turns out\nto be particularly vivid in the dream is probably traceable to such real\nsensations during sleep. My experience has never confirmed this. It is\nincorrect to say that those elements of the dream which are the\nderivatives of impressions occurring in sleep (nervous excitements) are\ndistinguished by their vividness from others which are based on\nrecollections. The factor of reality is of no account in determining the\nintensity of dream images.\nFurthermore, the expectation will be cherished that the sensory\nintensity (vividness) of individual dream images has a relation to the\npsychic intensity of the elements corresponding to them in the\ndream-thoughts. In the latter intensity is identical with psychic value;\nthe most intense elements are in fact the most significant, and these\nare the central point of the dream. We know, however, that it is just\nthese elements which are usually not accepted in the dream content owing\nto the censor. But still it might be possible that the elements\nimmediately following these and representing them might show a higher\ndegree of intensity, without, however, for that reason constituting the\ncentre of the dream representation. This expectation is also destroyed\nby a comparison of the dream and the dream material. The intensity of\nthe elements in the one has nothing to do with the intensity of the\nelements in the other; a complete \u201ctransvaluation of all psychic values\u201d\ntakes place between the dream-material and the dream. The very element\nwhich is transient and hazy and which is pushed into the background by\nmore vigorous images is often the single and only element in which may\nbe traced any direct derivative from the subject which entirely\ndominated the dream-thoughts.\nThe intensity of the elements of the dream shows itself to be determined\nin a different manner\u2014that is, by two factors which are independent of\neach other. It is easy to see at the outset that those elements by means\nof which the wish-fulfilment is expressed are most distinctly\nrepresented. But then analysis also teaches us that from the most vivid\nelements of the dream, the greatest number of trains of thought start,\nand that the most vivid are at the same time those which are best\ndetermined. No change of sense is involved if we express the latter\nempirical thesis in the following form: the greatest intensity is shown\nby those elements of the dream for which the most abundant condensation\nactivity was required. We may therefore expect that this condition and\nthe others imposed by the wish-fulfilment can be expressed in a single\nformula.\nThe problem which I have just been considering\u2014the causes of greater or\nless intensity or distinctness of individual elements of the dream\u2014is\none which I should like to guard against being confused with another\nproblem, which has to do with the varying distinctness of whole dreams\nor sections of dreams. In the first case, the opposite of distinctness\nis blurredness; in the second, confusion. It is of course unmistakable\nthat the intensities rise and fall in the two scales in unison. A\nportion of the dream which seems clear to us usually contains vivid\nelements; an obscure dream is composed of less intense elements. But the\nproblem with which we are confronted by the scale, ranging from the\napparently clear to the indistinct or confused, is far more complicated\nthan that formed by variations in the vividness of the dream elements;\nindeed the former will be dropped from the discussion for reasons which\nwill be given later. In isolated cases we are astonished to find that\nthe impression of clearness or indistinctness produced by the dream is\naltogether without significance for its structure, and that it\noriginates in the dream material as one of its constituents. Thus I\nremember a dream which seemed particularly well constructed, flawless,\nand clear, so that I made up my mind, while I was still in the somnolent\nstate, to recognise a new class of dreams\u2014those which had not been\nsubject to the mechanism of condensation and displacement, and which\nmight thus be designated \u201cFancies while asleep.\u201d A closer examination\nproved that this rare dream had the same breaches and flaws in its\nconstruction as every other; for this reason I abandoned the category of\ndream fancies. The content of the dream, reduced to its lowest terms,\nwas that I was reciting to a friend a difficult and long-sought theory\nof bisexuality, and the wish-fulfilling power of the dream was\nresponsible for the fact that this theory (which, by the way, was not\nstated in the dream) appeared so clear and flawless. What I considered a\njudgment upon the finished dream was thus a part of the dream content,\nand the essential one at that. The dream activity had extended its\noperations, as it were, into waking thought, and had presented to me in\nthe form of a judgment that part of the dream material which it had not\nsucceeded in reproducing with exactness. The exact opposite of this once\ncame to my attention in the case of a female patient who was at first\naltogether unwilling to tell a dream which was necessary for the\nanalysis, \u201cbecause it was so obscure and confused,\u201d and who declared,\nafter repeatedly denying the accuracy of her description, that several\npersons, herself, her husband, and her father, had occurred in the\ndream, and that it seemed as though she did not know whether her husband\nwas her father, or who her father was anyway, or something of that sort.\nUpon considering this dream in connection with the ideas that occurred\nto the dreamer in the course of the sitting, it was found unquestionably\nto be concerned with the story of a servant girl who had to confess that\nshe was expecting a child, and who was now confronted with doubts as to\n\u201cwho was really the father.\u201d[DX] The obscurity manifested by the dream,\ntherefore, is again in this case a portion of the material which excited\nit. A part of this material was represented in the form of the dream.\nThe form of the dream or of dreaming is used with astonishing frequency\nto represent the concealed content.\nComments on the dream and seemingly harmless observations about it often\nserve in the most subtle manner to conceal\u2014although they usually\nbetray\u2014a part of what is dreamed. Thus, for example, when the dreamer\nsays: _Here the dream is vague_, and the analysis gives an infantile\nreminiscence of listening to a person cleaning himself after defecation.\nAnother example deserves to be recorded in detail. A young man has a\nvery distinct dream which recalls to him phantasies from his infancy\nwhich have remained conscious to him: he was in a summer hotel one\nevening, he mistook the number of his room, and entered a room in which\nan elderly lady and her two daughters were undressing to go to bed. He\ncontinues: \u201c_Then there are some gaps in the dream; then something is\nmissing_; and at the end there was a man in the room who wished to throw\nme out with whom I had to wrestle.\u201d He endeavoured in vain to recall the\ncontent and purpose of the boyish fancy to which the dream apparently\nalludes. But we finally become aware that the required content had\nalready been given in his utterances concerning the indistinct part of\nthe dream. The \u201cgaps\u201d were the openings in the genitals of the women who\nwere retiring: \u201cHere something is missing\u201d described the chief character\nof the female genitals. In those early years he burned with curiosity to\nsee a female genital, and was still inclined to adhere to the infantile\nsexual theory which attributes a male genital to the woman.\nAll the dreams which have been dreamed in the same night belong to the\nsame whole when considered with respect to their content; their\nseparation into several portions, their grouping and number, all these\ndetails are full of meaning, and may be considered as information coming\nfrom the latent dream content. In the interpretation of dreams\nconsisting of many principal sections, or of dreams belonging to the\nsame night, one must not fail to think of the possibility that these\ndifferent and succeeding dreams bring to expression the same feelings in\ndifferent material. The one that comes first in time of these homologous\ndreams is usually the most disfigured and most bashful, while the\nsucceeding is bolder and more distinct.\nEven Pharaoh\u2019s dream in the Bible of the ears and the kine, which Joseph\ninterpreted, was of this kind. It is reported by Josephus (_Antiquities\nof the Jews_, bk. ii. chap, iii.) in greater detail than in the Bible.\nAfter relating the first dream, the King said: \u201cWhen I had seen this\nvision I awaked out of my sleep, and being in disorder, and considering\nwith myself what this appearance should be, I fell asleep again, and saw\nanother dream much more wonderful than the first, which did still more\naffright and disturb me.\u201d After listening to the report of the dream,\nJoseph said, \u201cThis dream, O King, although seen under two forms,\nsignifies one and the same issue of things.\u201d\nJung,[99] who, in his _Beitrag zur Psychologie des Ger\u00fcchtes_ relates\nhow the veiled erotic dream of a school-girl was understood by her\nfriends without interpretation and continued by them with variations,\nremarks in connection with reports of this dream, \u201cthat the last of a\nlong series of dream pictures contained precisely the same thought whose\nrepresentation had been attempted in the first picture of the series.\nThe censor pushed the complex out of the way as long as possible,\nthrough constantly renewed symbolic concealments, displacements,\ndeviations into the harmless, &c.\u201d (_l.c._ p. 87). Scherner[58] was well\nacquainted with the peculiarities of dream disfigurement and describes\nthem at the end of his theory of organic stimulation as a special law,\np. 166: \u201cBut, finally, the phantasy observes the general law in all\nnerve stimuli emanating from symbolic dream formations, by representing\nat the beginning of the dream only the remotest and freest allusions to\nthe stimulating object; but towards the end, when the power of\nrepresentation becomes exhausted, it presents the stimulus or its\nconcerned organ or its function in unconcealed form, and in the way this\ndream designates its organic motive and reaches its end.\u201d\nA new confirmation of Scherner\u2019s law has been furnished by Otto\nRank[106] in his work, _A Self Interpretation Dream_. This dream of a\ngirl reported by him consisted of two dreams, separated in time of the\nsame night, the second of which ended with pollution. This pollution\ndream could be interpreted in all its details by disregarding a great\nmany of the ideas contributed by the dreamer, and the profuse relations\nbetween the two dream contents indicated that the first dream expressed\nin bashful language the same thing as the second, so that the latter\u2014the\npollution dream\u2014helped to a full explanation of the former. From this\nexample, Rank, with perfect justice, draws conclusions concerning the\nsignificance of pollution dreams in general.\nBut in my experience it is only in rare cases that one is in a position\nto interpret clearness or confusion in the dream as certainty or doubt\nin the dream material. Later I shall try to discover the factor in the\nformation of dreams upon whose influence this scale of qualities\nessentially depends.\nIn some dreams, which adhere for a time to a certain situation and\nscenery, there occur interruptions described in the following words:\n\u201cBut then it seemed as though it were at the same time another place,\nand there such and such a thing happened.\u201d What thus interrupts the main\ntrend of the dream, which after a while may be continued again, turns\nout to be a subordinate idea, an interpolated thought in the dream\nmaterial. A conditional relation in the dream-thoughts is represented by\nsimultaneousness in the dream (wenn\u2014wann; if\u2014when).\nWhat is signified by the sensation of impeded movement, which so often\noccurs in the dream, and which is so closely allied to anxiety? One\nwants to move, and is unable to stir from the spot; or one wants to\naccomplish something, and meets one obstacle after another. The train is\nabout to start, and one cannot reach it; one\u2019s hand is raised to avenge\nan insult, and its strength fails, &c. We have already encountered this\nsensation in exhibition dreams, but have as yet made no serious attempt\nto interpret it. It is convenient, but inadequate, to answer that there\nis motor paralysis in sleep, which manifests itself by means of the\nsensation alluded to. We may ask: \u201cWhy is it, then, that we do not dream\ncontinually of these impeded motions?\u201d And we are justified in supposing\nthat this sensation, constantly appearing in sleep, serves some purpose\nor other in representation, and is brought about by a need occurring in\nthe dream material for this sort of representation.\nFailure to accomplish does not always appear in the dream as a\nsensation, but also simply as a part of the dream content. I believe\nthat a case of this sort is particularly well suited to enlighten us\nabout the significance of this characteristic of the dream. I shall give\nan abridged report of a dream in which I seem to be accused of\ndishonesty. _The scene is a mixture, consisting of a private sanatorium\nand several other buildings. A lackey appears to call me to an\nexamination. I know in the dream that something has been missed, and\nthat the examination is taking place because I am suspected of having\nappropriated the lost article. Analysis shows that examination is to be\ntaken in two senses, and also means medical examination. Being conscious\nof my innocence, and of the fact that I have been called in for\nconsultation, I calmly follow the lackey. We are received at the door by\nanother lackey, who says, pointing to me, \u201cIs that the person whom you\nhave brought? Why, he is a respectable man.\u201d Thereupon, without any\nlackey, I enter a great hall in which machines are standing, and which\nreminds me of an Inferno with its hellish modes of punishment. I see a\ncolleague strapped on to one apparatus who has every reason to be\nconcerned about me; but he takes no notice of me. Then I am given to\nunderstand that I may now go. Then I cannot find my hat, and cannot go\nafter all._\nThe wish which the dream fulfils is obviously that I may be acknowledged\nto be an honest man, and may go; all kinds of subject-matter containing\na contradiction of this idea must therefore be present in the\ndream-thoughts. The fact that I may go is the sign of my absolution; if,\nthen, the dream furnishes at its close an event which prevents me from\ngoing, we may readily conclude that the suppressed subject-matter of the\ncontradiction asserts itself in this feature. The circumstance that I\ncannot find my hat therefore means: \u201cYou are not an honest man after\nall.\u201d Failure to accomplish in the dream is the expression of a\ncontradiction, a \u201cNo\u201d; and therefore the earlier assertion, to the\neffect that the dream is not capable of expressing a negation, must be\nrevised accordingly.[DY]\nIn other dreams which involve failure to accomplish a thing not only as\na situation but also as a sensation, the same contradiction is more\nemphatically expressed in the form of a volition, to which a counter\nvolition opposes itself. Thus the sensation of impeded motion represents\na _conflict of will_. We shall hear later that this very motor paralysis\nbelongs to the fundamental conditions of the psychic process in\ndreaming. Now the impulse which is transferred to motor channels is\nnothing else than the will, and the fact that we are sure to find this\nimpulse impeded in the dream makes the whole process extraordinarily\nwell suited to represent volition and the \u201cNo\u201d which opposes itself\nthereto. From my explanation of anxiety, it is easy to understand why\nthe sensation of thwarted will is so closely allied to anxiety, and why\nit is so often connected with it in the dream. Anxiety is a libidinous\nimpulse which emanates from the unconscious, and is inhibited by the\nforeconscious. Therefore, when a sensation of inhibition in the dream is\naccompanied by anxiety, there must also be present a volition which has\nat one time been capable of arousing a _libido_; there must be a sexual\nimpulse.\nWhat significance and what psychic force is to be ascribed to such\nmanifestations of judgment as \u201cFor that is only a dream,\u201d which\nfrequently comes to the surface in dreams, I shall discuss in another\nplace (_vide infra_, p. 390). For the present I shall merely say that\nthey serve to depreciate the value of the thing dreamed. An interesting\nproblem allied to this, namely, the meaning of the fact that sometimes a\ncertain content is designated in the dream itself as \u201cdreamed\u201d\u2014the\nriddle of the \u201cdream within the dream\u201d\u2014has been solved in a similar\nsense by W. Stekel[114] through the analysis of some convincing\nexamples. The part of the dream \u201cdreamed\u201d is again to be depreciated in\nvalue and robbed of its reality; that which the dreamer continues to\ndream after awakening from the dream within the dream, is what the\ndream-wish desires to put in place of the extinguished reality. It may\ntherefore be assumed that the part \u201cdreamed\u201d contains the representation\nof the reality and the real reminiscence, while, on the other hand, the\ncontinued dream contains the representation of what the dreamer wished.\nThe inclusion of a certain content in a \u201cdream within the dream\u201d is\ntherefore equivalent to the wish that what has just been designated as a\ndream should not have occurred. The dream-work utilises the dream itself\nas a form of deflection.\n(_d_) _Regard for Presentability_\nSo far we have been attempting to ascertain how the dream represents the\nrelations among the dream-thoughts, but we have several times extended\nour consideration to the further question of what alterations the dream\nmaterial undergoes for the purposes of dream formation. We now know that\nthe dream material, after being stripped of the greater parts of its\nrelations, is subjected to compression, while at the same time\ndisplacements of intensity among its elements force a psychic\nrevaluation of this material. The displacements which we have considered\nwere shown to be substitutions of one idea for another, the substitute\nbeing in some way connected with the original by associations, and the\ndisplacements were put to the service of condensation by virtue of the\nfact that in this manner a common mean between two elements took the\nplace of these two elements in the formation of the dream. We have not\nyet mentioned any other kind of displacement. But we learn from the\nanalyses that another exists, and that it manifests itself in a change\nof the verbal expression employed for the thought in question. In both\ncases we have displacement following a chain of associations, but the\nsame process takes place in different psychic spheres, and the result of\nthis displacement in the one case is that one element is substituted for\nanother, while in the other case an element exchanges its verbal\nexpression for another.\nThis second kind of displacement occurring in dream formation not only\npossesses great theoretical interest, but is also peculiarly well fitted\nto explain the semblance of phantastic absurdity in which the dream\ndisguises itself. Displacement usually occurs in such a way that a\ncolourless and abstract expression in the dream-thought is exchanged for\none that is visual and concrete. The advantage, and consequently the\npurpose, of this substitution is obvious. Whatever is visual is _capable\nof representation_ in the dream, and can be wrought into situations\nwhere the abstract expression would confront dream representation with\ndifficulties similar to those which would arise if a political editorial\nwere to be represented in an illustrated journal. But not only the\npossibility of representation, but also the interests of condensation\nand of the censor, can be furthered by this change. If the abstractly\nexpressed and unwieldy dream-thought is recast into figurative language,\nthis new expression and the rest of the dream material are more easily\nfurnished with those identities and cross references, which are\nessential to the dream activity and which it creates whenever they are\nnot at hand, for the reason that in every language concrete terms, owing\nto their evolution, are more abundant in associations than conceptual\nones. It may be imagined that in dream formation a good part of the\nintermediary activity, which tries to reduce the separate dream-thoughts\nto the tersest and simplest possible expression in the dream, takes\nplace in the manner above described\u2014that is to say, in providing\nsuitable paraphrase for the individual thoughts. One thought whose\nexpression has already been determined on other grounds will thus exert\na separating and selective influence upon the means available for\nexpressing the other, and perhaps it will do this constantly throughout,\nsomewhat after the manner of the poet. If a poem in rhyme is to be\ncomposed, the second rhyming line is bound by two conditions; it must\nexpress the proper meaning, and it must express it in such a way as to\nsecure the rhyme. The best poems are probably those in which the poet\u2019s\neffort to find a rhyme is unconscious, and in which both thoughts have\nfrom the beginning exercised a mutual influence in the selection of\ntheir verbal expressions, which can then be made to rhyme by a means of\nslight remodification.\nIn some cases change of expression serves the purposes of dream\ncondensation more directly, in making possible the invention of a verbal\nconstruction which is ambiguous and therefore suited to the expression\nof more than one dream-thought. The whole range of word-play is thus put\nat the service of the dream activity. The part played by words in the\nformation of dreams ought not to surprise us. A word being a point of\njunction for a number of conceptions, it possesses, so to speak, a\npredestined ambiguity, and neuroses (obsessions, phobias) take advantage\nof the conveniences which words offer for the purposes of condensation\nand disguise quite as readily as the dream.[DZ] That dream conception\nalso profits by this displacement of expression is easily demonstrated.\nIt is naturally confusing if an ambiguous word is put in the place of\ntwo ambiguous ones; and the employment of a figurative expression\ninstead of the sober everyday one thwarts our understanding, especially\nsince the dream never tells us whether the elements which it shows are\nto be interpreted literally or figuratively, or whether they refer to\nthe dream material directly or only through the agency of interpolated\nforms of speech.[EA] Several examples of representations in the dream\nwhich are held together only by ambiguity have already been cited (\u201cher\nmouth opens without difficulty,\u201d in the dream of Irma\u2019s injection; \u201cI\ncannot go yet,\u201d in the last dream reported, p. 312), &c. I shall now\ncite a dream in the analysis of which the figurative expression of\nabstract thought plays a greater part. The difference between such dream\ninterpretation and interpretation by symbolism may again be sharply\ndistinguished; in the symbolic interpretation of dreams the key to the\nsymbolism is arbitrarily chosen by the interpreter, while in our own\ncases of verbal disguise all these keys are universally known and are\ntaken from established customs of speech. If the correct notion occurs\nat the right opportunity, it is possible to solve dreams of this sort\ncompletely or in part, independently of any statements made by the\ndreamer.\nA lady, a friend of mine, dreams: _She is in the opera-house. It is a\nWagnerian performance which has lasted till 7.45 in the morning. In the\nparquette and parterre there are tables, around which people dine and\ndrink. Her cousin and his young wife, who have just returned from their\nhoneymoon, sit next to her at one of these tables, and next to them sits\none of the aristocracy. Concerning the latter the idea is that the young\nwife has brought him back with her from the wedding journey. It is quite\nabove board, just as if she were bringing back a hat from her trip. In\nthe midst of the parquette there is a high tower, on the top of which is\na platform surrounded by an iron grating. There, high up, stands the\nconductor with the features of Hans Richter; he is continually running\naround behind the grating, perspiring awfully, and from this position\nconducting the orchestra, which is arranged around the base of the\ntower. She herself sits in a box with a lady friend (known to me). Her\nyoungest sister tries to hand her from the parquette a big piece of coal\nwith the idea that she did not know that it would last so long and that\nshe must by this time be terribly cold. (It was a little as if the boxes\nhad to be heated during the long performance.)_\nThe dream is senseless enough, though the situation is well developed\ntoo\u2014the tower in the midst of the parquette from which the conductor\nleads the orchestra; but, above all, the coal which her sister hands\nher! I purposely asked for no analysis of this dream. With the knowledge\nI have of the personal relations of the dreamer, I was able to interpret\nparts of it independently. I knew that she had entertained warm feelings\nfor a musician whose career had been prematurely blasted by insanity. I\ntherefore decided to take the tower in the parquette verbally. It was\napparent, then, that the man whom she wished to see in the place of Hans\nRichter _towered_ above all the other members of the orchestra. This\ntower must, therefore, be designated as a composite picture formed by an\napposition; with its pedestal it represents the greatness of the man,\nbut with its gratings on top, behind which he runs around like a\nprisoner or an animal in a cage (an allusion to the name of the\nunfortunate man), it represents his later fate. \u201cLunatic-tower\u201d is\nperhaps the word in which both thoughts might have met.\nNow that we have discovered the dream\u2019s method of representation, we may\ntry with the same key to open the second apparent absurdity,\u2014that of the\ncoal which her sister hands her. \u201cCoal\u201d must mean \u201csecret love.\u201d\n\u201cNo _coal_, no _fire_ so hotly glows\nAs the _secret love_ which no one knows.\u201d\nShe and her friend remain seated while her younger sister, who still has\nopportunities to marry, hands her up the coal \u201cbecause she did not know\nit would last so long.\u201d What would last so long is not told in the\ndream. In relating it we would supply \u201cthe performance\u201d; but in the\ndream we must take the sentence as it is, declare it ambiguous, and add\n\u201cuntil she marries.\u201d The interpretation \u201csecret love\u201d is then confirmed\nby the mention of the cousin who sits with his wife in the parquette,\nand by the open love-affair attributed to the latter. The contrasts\nbetween secret and open love, between her fire and the coldness of the\nyoung wife, dominate the dream. Moreover, here again there is a person\n\u201cin high position\u201d as a middle term between the aristocrat and the\nmusician entitled to high hopes.\nBy means of the above discussion we have at last brought to light a\nthird factor, whose part in the transformation of the dream thoughts\ninto the dream content is not to be considered trivial; _it is the\nregard for presentability_ (_German: Darstellbarkeit_) _in the peculiar\npsychic material which the dream makes use of_,\u2014that is fitness for\nrepresentation, for the most part by means of visual images. Among the\nvarious subordinate ideas associated with the essential dream thoughts,\nthat one will be preferred which permits of a visual representation, and\nthe dream-activity does not hesitate promptly to recast the inflexible\nthought into another verbal form, even if it is the more unusual one, as\nlong as this form makes dramatisation possible, and thus puts an end to\nthe psychological distress caused by cramped thinking. This pouring of\nthe thought content into another mould may at the same time be put at\nthe service of the condensation work, and may establish relations with\nanother thought which would otherwise not be present. This other thought\nitself may perhaps have previously changed its original expression for\nthe purpose of meeting these relations half-way.\nIn view of the part played by puns, quotations, songs, and proverbs in\nthe intellectual life of educated persons, it would be entirely in\naccordance with our expectation to find disguises of this sort used with\nextraordinary frequency. For a few kinds of material a universally\napplicable dream symbolism has been established on a basis of generally\nknown allusions and equivalents. A good part of this symbolism,\nmoreover, is possessed by the dream in common with the psychoneuroses,\nand with legends and popular customs.\nIndeed, if we look more closely, we must recognise that in employing\nthis method of substitution the dream is generally doing nothing\noriginal. For the attainment of its purpose, which in this case is the\npossibility of dramatisation without interference from the censor, it\nsimply follows the paths which it finds already marked out in\nunconscious thought, and gives preference to those transformations of\nthe suppressed material which may become conscious also in the form of\nwit and allusion, and with which all the fancies of neurotics are\nfilled. Here all at once we come to understand Scherner\u2019s method of\ndream interpretation, the essential truth of which I have defended\nelsewhere. The occupation of one\u2019s fancy with one\u2019s own body is by no\nmeans peculiar to, or characteristic of the dream alone. My analyses\nhave shown me that this is a regular occurrence in the unconscious\nthought of neurotics, and goes back to sexual curiosity, the object of\nwhich for the adolescent youth or maiden is found in the genitals of the\nopposite sex, or even of the same sex. But, as Scherner and Volkelt very\nappropriately declare, the house is not the only group of ideas which is\nused for the symbolisation of the body\u2014either in the dream or in the\nunconscious fancies of the neurosis. I know some patients, to be sure,\nwho have steadily adhered to an architectural symbolism for the body and\nthe genitals (sexual interest certainly extends far beyond the region of\nthe external genital organs), to whom posts and pillars signify legs (as\nin the \u201cSong of Songs\u201d), to whom every gate suggests a bodily opening\n(\u201chole\u201d), and every water-main a urinary apparatus, and the like. But\nthe group of associations belonging to plant life and to the kitchen is\njust as eagerly chosen to conceal sexual images; in the first case the\nusage of speech, the result of phantastic comparisons dating from the\nmost ancient times, has made abundant preparation (the \u201cvineyard\u201d of the\nLord, the \u201cseeds,\u201d the \u201cgarden\u201d of the girl in the \u201cSong of Songs\u201d). The\nugliest as well as the most intimate details of sexual life may be\ndreamed about in apparently harmless allusions to culinary operations,\nand the symptoms of hysteria become practically unintelligible if we\nforget that sexual symbolism can conceal itself behind the most\ncommonplace and most inconspicuous matters, as its best hiding-place.\nThe fact that some neurotic children cannot look at blood and raw meat,\nthat they vomit at the sight of eggs and noodles, and that the dread of\nsnakes, which is natural to mankind, is monstrously exaggerated in\nneurotics, all of this has a definite sexual meaning. Wherever the\nneurosis employs a disguise of this sort, it treads the paths once\ntrodden by the whole of humanity in the early ages of civilisation\u2014paths\nof whose existence customs of speech, superstitions, and morals still\ngive testimony to this day.\nI here insert the promised flower dream of a lady patient, in which I\nhave italicised everything which is to be sexually interpreted. This\nbeautiful dream seemed to lose its entire charm for the dreamer after it\nhad been interpreted.\n(_a_) Preliminary dream: _She goes to the two maids in the kitchen and\nscolds them for taking so long to prepare \u201ca little bite of food.\u201d She\nalso sees a great many coarse dishes standing in the kitchen inverted so\nthat the water may drip off them, and heaped up in a pile._ Later\naddition: _The two maids go to fetch water, and must, as it were, step\ninto a river which reaches up into the house or into the yard._[EB]\n(_b_) Main dream[EC]: _She is descending from a high place[ED] over\nbalustrades that are curiously fashioned or fences which are united into\nbig squares and consist of a conglomeration of little squares.[EE] It is\nreally not intended for climbing upon; she is worried about finding a\nplace for her foot, and she is glad her dress doesn\u2019t get caught\nanywhere, and that she remains so respectable while she is going.[EF]\nShe is also carrying a large bough in her hand,[EG] really a bough of a\ntree, which is thickly studded with red blossoms; it has many branches,\nand spreads out.[EH] With this is connected the idea of cherry blossoms,\nbut they look like full-bloom camelias, which of course do not grow on\ntrees. While she is descending, she first has one, then suddenly two,\nand later again only one.[EI] When she arrives at the bottom of the\nlower blossoms they have already fallen off to a considerable extent.\nNow that she is at the bottom, she sees a porter who is combing\u2014as she\nwould like to express it\u2014just such a tree\u2014that is, who is plucking thick\nbunches of hair from it, which hang from it like moss. Other workmen\nhave chopped off such boughs in a garden, and have thrown them upon the\nstreet, where they lie about, so that many people take some of them. But\nshe asks whether that is right, whether anybody may take one.[EJ] In the\ngarden there stands a young man_ (having a personality with which she is\nacquainted, not a member of her family) _up to whom she goes in order to\nask him how it is possible to transplant such boughs into her own\ngarden.[EK] He embraces her, whereat she resists and asks him what he\nmeans, whether it is permissible to embrace her in such a manner. He\nsays that there is no wrong in it, that it is permitted.[EL] He then\ndeclares himself willing to go with her into the other garden, in order\nto show her the transplanting, and he says something to her which she\ndoes not correctly understand: \u201cBesides this three metres_\u2014(later on she\nsays: square metres) _or three fathoms of ground are lacking.\u201d It seems\nas though the man were trying to ask her something in return for his\naffability, as though he had the intention of indemnifying himself in\nher garden, as though he wanted to evade some law or other, to derive\nsome advantage from it without causing her an injury. She does not know\nwhether or not he really shows her anything._[EM]\nI must mention still another series of associations which often serves\nthe purpose of concealing sexual meaning both in dreams and in the\nneurosis,\u2014I refer to the change of residence series. To change one\u2019s\nresidence is readily replaced by \u201cto remove,\u201d an ambiguous expression\nwhich may have reference to clothing. If the dream also contains a\n\u201clift\u201d (elevator), one may think of the verb \u201cto lift,\u201d hence of lifting\nup the clothing.\nI have naturally an abundance of such material, but a report of it would\ncarry us too far into the discussion of neurotic conditions. Everything\nleads to the same conclusion, that no special symbolising activity of\nthe mind in the formation of dreams need be assumed; that, on the\ncontrary, the dream makes use of such symbolisations as are to be found\nready-made in unconscious thought, because these better satisfy the\nrequirements of dream formation, on account of their dramatic fitness,\nand particularly on account of their exemption from the censor.\n(_e_) _Examples\u2014Arithmetic Speeches in the Dream_\nBefore I proceed to assign to its proper place the fourth of the factors\nwhich control the formation of the dream, I shall cite several examples\nfrom my collection of dreams for the purpose partly of illustrating the\nco-operation of the three factors with which we are acquainted, and\npartly of supplying proof for assertions which have been made without\ndemonstration or of drawing irrefutable inferences from them. For it has\nbeen very difficult for me in the foregoing account of the dream\nactivity to demonstrate my conclusions by means of examples. Examples\nfor the individual thesis are convincing only when considered in\nconnection with a dream interpretation; when they are torn from their\ncontext they lose their significance, and, furthermore, a dream\ninterpretation, though not at all profound, soon becomes so extensive\nthat it obscures the thread of the discussion which it is intended to\nillustrate. This technical motive may excuse me for now mixing together\nall sorts of things which have nothing in common but their relation to\nthe text of the foregoing chapter.\nWe shall first consider a few examples of very peculiar or unusual\nmethods of representation in the dream. The dream of a lady is as\nfollows: _A servant girl is standing on a ladder as though to clean the\nwindows, and has with her a chimpanzee and a gorilla cat_ (later\ncorrected\u2014angora cat). _She throws the animals at the dreamer; the\nchimpanzee cuddles up to her, and this is disgusting to her._ This dream\nhas accomplished its purpose by the simplest possible means, namely by\ntaking a mere mode of speech literally and representing it according to\nthe meaning of its words. \u201cApe,\u201d like the names of animals in general,\nis an epithet of opprobrium, and the situation of the dream means\nnothing but \u201c_to hurl invectives_.\u201d This same collection will soon\nfurnish us with further examples of the use of this simple artifice.\nAnother dream proceeds in a very similar manner: _A woman with a child\nthat has a conspicuously deformed cranium; the dreamer has heard that\nthe child got into this condition owing to its position in its mother\u2019s\nwomb. The doctor says that the cranium might be given a better shape by\nmeans of compression, but that would harm the brain. She thinks that\nbecause it is a boy it won\u2019t suffer so much from deformity._ This dream\ncontains a plastic representation of the concept: \u201c_Childish\nimpressions_,\u201d which the dreamer has heard of in the course of\nexplanations concerning the treatment.\nIn the following example, the dream activity enters upon a different\npath. The dream contains a recollection of an excursion to the\nHilmteich, near Graz: _There is a terrible storm outside; a miserable\nhotel\u2014the water is dripping from the walls, and the beds are damp._ (The\nlatter part of the content is less directly expressed than I give it.)\nThe dream signifies \u201c_superfluous_.\u201d The abstract idea occurring in the\ndream thoughts is first made equivocal by a certain straining of\nlanguage; it has, perhaps, been replaced by \u201coverflowing\u201d or by \u201cfluid\u201d\nand \u201csuper-fluid (-fluous)\u201d and has then been given representation by an\naccumulation of like impressions. Water within, water without, water in\nthe beds in the form of dampness\u2014everything fluid and \u201csuper\u201d fluid.\nThat, for the purposes of the dream representation, the spelling is much\nless regarded than the sound of words ought not surprise us when we\nremember that rhyme exercises similar privileges.\nThe fact that language has at its disposal a great number of words which\nwere originally intended in a picturesque and concrete sense but are at\npresent used in a faded abstract sense has in other cases made it very\neasy for the dream to represent its thoughts. The dream need only\nrestore to these words their full significance, or follow the evolution\nof their meaning a little way back. For example, a man dreams that his\nfriend, who is struggling to get out of a very tight place, calls upon\nhim to help him. The analysis shows that the tight place is a hole, and\nthat the dream uses symbolically his very words to his friend, \u201cBe\ncareful, or you\u2019ll get yourself into a hole.\u201d[EN] Another dreamer climbs\nupon a mountain from which he sees a very extraordinary broad view. He\nidentifies himself with his brother who is editing a \u201creview\u201d which\ndeals with relations to the Farthest East.\nIt would be a separate undertaking to collect such methods of\nrepresentation and to arrange them according to the principles upon\nwhich they are based. Some of the representations are quite witty. They\ngive the impression that they would have never been divined if the\ndreamer himself had not reported them.\n1. A man dreams that he is asked for a name, which, however, he cannot\nrecall. He himself explains that this means: _It does not occur to me in\nthe dream._\n2. A female patient relates a dream in which all the persons concerned\nwere especially big. \u201cThat means,\u201d she adds, \u201cthat it must deal with an\nepisode of my early childhood, for at that time all grown up people\nnaturally seemed to me immensely big.\u201d\nThe transference into childhood is also expressed differently in other\ndreams by translating time into space. One sees the persons and scenes\nin question as if at a great distance, at the end of a long road, or as\nif looked at through the wrong end of the opera-glass.\n3. A man, who in waking life shows an inclination to abstract and\nindefinite expressions, but who is otherwise endowed with wit enough,\ndreams in a certain connection that he is at a railroad station while a\ntrain is coming in. But then the station platform approaches the train,\nwhich stands still; hence an absurd inversion of the real state of\naffairs. This detail is again nothing but an index to remind one that\nsomething else in the dream should be turned about. The analysis of the\nsame dream brings back the recollection of a picture-book in which men\nare represented standing on their heads and walking on their hands.\n4. The same dreamer on another occasion relates a short dream which\nalmost recalls the technique of a rebus. His uncle gives him a kiss in\nan automobile. He immediately adds the interpretation, which I should\nnever have found: it means _Autoerotism_. This might have been made as a\njoke in the waking state.\nThe dream work often succeeds in representing very awkward material,\nsuch as proper names, by means of the forced utilisation of very\nfar-fetched references. In one of my dreams the elder Bruecke _has given\nme a task. I compound a preparation, and skim something from it which\nlooks like crumpled tinfoil._ (More of this later on.) The notion\ncorresponding to this, which was not easy to find, is \u201cstanniol,\u201d and\nnow I know that I have in mind the name of the author Stannius, which\nwas borne by a treatise on the nervous system of fishes, which I\nregarded with awe in my youthful years. The first scientific task which\nmy teacher gave me was actually concerned with the nervous system of a\nfish\u2014the _Ammoc\u0153tes_. Obviously the latter name could never have been\nused in a picture puzzle.\nI shall not omit here to insert a dream having a curious content, which\nis also remarkable as a child\u2019s dream, and which is very easily\nexplained by the analysis. A lady relates: \u201cI can remember that when I\nwas a child I repeatedly dreamed, that the _dear Lord had a pointed\npaper hat on his head_. They used to make me wear such a hat at table\nvery often, so that I might not be able to look at the plates of the\nother children and see how much they had received of a particular dish.\nSince I have learned that God is omniscient, the dream signifies that I\nknow everything in spite of the hat which I am made to wear.\u201d\nWherein the dream work consists, and how it manages its material, the\ndream thoughts, can be shown in a very instructive manner from the\nnumbers and calculations which occur in dreams. Moreover, numbers in\ndreams are regarded as of especial significance by superstition. I shall\ntherefore give a few more examples of this kind from my own collection.\n1. The following is taken from the dream of a lady shortly before the\nclose of her treatment:\nShe wants to pay for something or other; her daughter takes 3 florins\nand 65 kreuzer from her pocket-book; but the mother says: \u201cWhat are you\ndoing? It only costs 21 kreuzer.\u201d This bit of dream was immediately\nintelligible to me without further explanation from my knowledge of the\ndreamer\u2019s circumstances. The lady was a foreigner who had provided for\nher daughter in an educational institution in Vienna, and who could\ncontinue my treatment as long as her daughter stayed in the city. In\nthree weeks the daughter\u2019s school year was to end, and with that the\ntreatment also stopped. On the day before the dream the principal of the\ninstitute had urged her to make up her mind to allow her child to remain\nwith her for another year. She had then obviously worked out this\nsuggestion to the conclusion that in this case she would be able to\ncontinue the treatment for one year more. Now, this is what the dream\nrefers to, for a year is equal to 365 days; the three weeks that remain\nbefore the close of the school year and of the treatment are equivalent\nto 21 days (though the hours of treatment are not as many as that). The\nnumerals, which in the dream thoughts referred to time, are given money\nvalues in the dream, not without also giving expression to a deeper\nmeaning for \u201ctime is money.\u201d 365 kreuzer, to be sure, are _3 florins and\n65 kreuzer_. The smallness of the sums which appear in the dream is a\nself-evident wish-fulfilment; the wish has reduced the cost of both the\ntreatment and the year\u2019s instruction at the institution.\nII. The numerals in another dream involve more complicated relations. A\nyoung lady, who, however, has already been married a number of years,\nlearns that an acquaintance of hers of about her own age, Elsie L., has\njust become engaged. Thereupon she dreams: _She is sitting in the\ntheatre with her husband, and one side of the orchestra is quite\nunoccupied. Her husband tells her that Elsie L. and her husband had also\nwanted to go, but that they had been able to get nothing but poor seats,\nthree for 1 florin and 50 kreuzer, and of course they could not take\nthose. She thinks that they didn\u2019t lose much either._\nWhere do the _1 florin and 50 kreuzer_ come from? From an occurrence of\nthe previous day which is really indifferent. The dreamer\u2019s\nsister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from her husband,\nand had quickly got rid of them by buying some jewelry. Let us note that\n150 florins is 100 times more than 1 florin and 50 kreuzer. Whence the 3\nwhich stands before the theatre seats? There is only one association for\nthis, namely, that the bride is that many months\u2014three\u2014younger than\nherself. Information concerning the significance of the feature that one\nside of the orchestra remains empty leads to the solution of the dream.\nThis feature is an undisguised allusion to a little occurrence which has\ngiven her husband good cause for teasing her. She had decided to go to\nthe theatre during the week, and had been careful to get tickets a few\ndays before, for which she had to pay the pre-emption charge. When they\ngot to the theatre they found that one side of the house was almost\nempty; she certainly did not need _to be in such a hurry_.\nI shall now substitute the dream thoughts for the dream: \u201cIt surely was\nnonsense to marry so early; there was _no need for my being in such a\nhurry_. From the case of Elsie L., I see that I should have got a\nhusband just the same\u2014and one who is a _hundred times_ better (husband,\nsweetheart, treasure)\u2014if I had only _waited_ (antithesis to the haste of\nher sister-in-law). I could have bought _three_ such men for the money\n(the dowry!). Our attention is drawn to the fact that the numerals in\nthis dream have changed their meanings and relations to a much greater\nextent than in the one previously considered. The transforming and\ndisfiguring activity of the dream has in this case been greater, a fact\nwhich we interpret as meaning that these dream thoughts had to overcome\na particularly great amount of inner psychic resistance up to the point\nof their representation. We must also not overlook the circumstance that\nthe dream contains an absurd element, namely, that _two_ persons take\n_three_ seats. We digress to the interpretation of the absurdity of\ndreams when we remark that this absurd detail of the dream content is\nintended to represent the most strongly emphasized detail of the dream\nthoughts: \u201cIt was _nonsense_ to marry so early.\u201d The figure 3 belonging\nto a quite subordinate relation of the two compared persons (three\nmonths\u2019 difference in age) has thus been skilfully used to produce the\nnonsense demanded by the dream. The reduction of the actual 150 florins\nto 1 florin and 50 kreuzer corresponds to her disdain of her husband in\nthe suppressed thoughts of the dreamer.\u201d\nIII. Another example displays the arithmetical powers of the dream,\nwhich have brought it into such disrepute. A man dreams: _He is sitting\nat B\u2014\u2014\u2019s_ (a family of his earlier acquaintance) _and says, \u201cIt was\nnonsense for you not to give me Amy in marriage.\u201d Thereupon he asks the\ngirl, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Answer: \u201cI was born in 1882.\u201d \u201cAh, then you are\n28 years old.\u201d_\nSince the dream occurs in the year 1898, this is obviously poor\narithmetic, and the inability of the dreamer to calculate may be\ncompared to that of the paralytic, if there is no other way of\nexplaining it. My patient was one of those persons who are always\nthinking about every woman they see. The person who followed him in my\noffice, regularly for several months, was a young lady, whom he used to\nmeet, about whom he used to ask frequently, and to whom he was very\nanxious to be polite. This was the lady whose age he estimated at 28\nyears. So much for explaining the result of the apparent calculation.\nBut 1882 was the year in which he had married. He had been unable to\nrefrain from engaging in conversation with the two females whom he met\nat my house\u2014two girls, by no means youthful, who alternately opened the\ndoor for him, and as he did not find them very responsive, he had given\nhimself the explanation that they probably considered him an elderly\n\u201csettled\u201d gentleman.\nIV. For another number dream with its interpretation,\u2014a\ndream distinguished by its obvious determination, or rather\nover-determination, I am indebted to B. Dattner:\nMy host, a policeman in the municipal service, dreamed that he was\nstanding at his post in the street, which was a wish-realisation. The\ninspector then came over to him, having on his gorget the numbers 22 and\n62 or 26\u2014at all events there were many two\u2019s on it. Division of the\nnumber 2262 in the reproduction of the dream at once points to the fact\nthat the components have separate meanings. It occurs to him that the\nday before, while on duty, they were discussing the duration of their\ntime of service. The occasion for this was furnished by an inspector who\nhad been pensioned at 62 years. The dreamer had only completed 22 years\nof service, and still needed 2 years and 2 months to make him eligible\nfor a 90 per cent. pension. The dream first shows him the fulfilment of\na long wished for wish, the rank of inspector. The superior with 2262 on\nhis collar is himself; he takes care to do his duty on the street, which\nis another preferred wish; he has served his 2 years and 2 months, and\ncan now be retired from the service with full pension, like the\n62\u2013year-old inspector.\nIf we keep in mind these examples and similar ones (to follow), we may\nsay: Dream activity does not calculate at all, whether correctly or\nincorrectly; it joins together in the form of a calculation numerals\nwhich occur in the dream thoughts, and which may serve as allusions to\nmaterial which is incapable of being represented. It thus utilises\nnumerals as material for the expression of its purposes in the same\nmanner as it does names and speeches known as word presentations.\nFor the dream activity cannot compose a new speech. No matter how many\nspeeches and answers may occur in dreams, which may be sensible or\nabsurd in themselves, analysis always shows in such cases that the dream\nhas only taken from the dream thoughts fragments of speeches which have\nbeen delivered or heard, and dealt with them in a most arbitrary manner.\nIt has not only torn them from their context and mutilated them, taken\nup one piece and rejected another, but it has also joined them together\nin a new way, so that the speech which seems coherent in the dream falls\ninto three or four sections in the course of analysis. In this new\nutilisation of the words, the dream has often put aside the meaning\nwhich they had in the dream thoughts, and has derived an entirely new\nmeaning from them.[EO] Upon closer inspection the more distinct and\ncompact constituents of the dream speech may be distinguished from\nothers which serve as connectives and have probably been supplied, just\nas we supply omitted letters and syllables in reading. The dream speech\nthus has the structure of breccia stones, in which larger pieces of\ndifferent material are held together by a solidified cohesive mass.\nIn a very strict sense this description is correct, to be sure, only for\nthose speeches in the dream which have something of the sensational\ncharacter of a speech, and which are described as \u201cspeeches.\u201d The others\nwhich have not, as it were, been felt as though heard or spoken (which\nhave no accompanying acoustic or motor emphasis in the dream) are simply\nthoughts such as occur in our waking thought activity, and are\ntransferred without change into many dreams. Our reading, also, seems to\nfurnish an abundant and not easily traceable source of material for\nspeeches, this material being of an indifferent nature. Everything,\nhowever, which appears conspicuously in the dream as a speech can be\nreferred to real speeches which have been made or heard by the dreamer\nhimself.\nWe have already found examples for the explanation of such dream\nspeeches in the analysis of dreams cited for other purposes. Here is one\nexample in place of many, all of which lead to the same conclusion.\n_A large courtyard in which corpses are cremated. The dreamer says: \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing away from here, I can\u2019t look at this.\u201d_ (Not a distinct speech.)\n_Then he meets two butcher boys and asks: \u201cWell, did it taste good?\u201d One\nof them answers: \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d As though it had been human\nflesh._\nThe harmless occasion for this dream is as follows: After taking supper\nwith his wife, the dreamer pays a visit to his worthy but by no means\nappetising neighbour. The hospitable old lady is just at her evening\nmeal, and _urges_ him (instead of this word a composite\nsexually-significant word is jocosely used among men) to taste of it. He\ndeclines, saying that he has no appetite. \u201c_Go on_, you can stand some\nmore,\u201d or something of the kind. The dreamer is thus forced to taste and\npraise what is offered. \u201cBut that\u2019s good!\u201d After he is alone again with\nhis wife, he scolds about the neighbour\u2019s importunity and about the\nquality of the food he has tasted. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the sight of it,\u201d a\nphrase not appearing even in the dream as an actual speech, is a thought\nwhich has reference to the physical charms of the lady who invites him,\nand which would be translated as meaning that he does not want to look\nat her.\nThe analysis of another dream which I cite at this point for the sake of\nthe very distinct speech that forms its nucleus, but which I shall\nexplain only when we come to consider emotions in the dream\u2014will be more\ninstructive. I dream very distinctly: _I have gone to Bruecke\u2019s\nlaboratory at night, and upon hearing a soft knocking at the door, I\nopen it to (the deceased) Professor Fleischl, who enters in the company\nof several strangers, and after saying a few words sits down at his\ntable._ Then follows a second dream: _My friend Fl. has come to Vienna\nin July without attracting much attention; I meet him on the street\nwhile he is in conversation with my_ (deceased) _friend P., and I go\nsomewhere or other with these two, and they sit down opposite each other\nas though at a little table, while I sit at the narrow end of the table\nfacing them. Fl. tells about his sister and says: \u201cIn three-quarters of\nan hour she was dead,\u201d and then something like: \u201cThat is the threshold.\u201d\nAs P. does not understand him, Fl. turns to me, and asks me how much I\nhave told of his affairs. Whereupon, seized by strange emotions, I want\nto tell Fl. that P._ (can\u2019t possibly know anything because he) _is not\nalive. But, noticing the mistake myself, I say: \u201cNon vixit.\u201d Then I look\nat P. searchingly, and under my gaze he becomes pale and blurred, his\neyes a morbid blue\u2014and at last he dissolves. I rejoice greatly at this;\nI now understand that Ernest Fleischl, too, was only an apparition, a\nrevenant, and I find that it is quite possible for such a person to\nexist only as long as one wants him to, and that he can be made to\ndisappear by the wish of another person._\nThis beautiful dream unites so many of the characteristics of the dream\ncontent which are problematic\u2014the criticism made in the dream itself in\nthat I myself notice my mistake in having said \u201cNon vixit\u201d instead of\n\u201cNon vivit\u201d; the unconstrained intercourse with dead persons, whom the\ndream itself declares to be dead; the absurdity of the inference and the\nintense satisfaction which the inference gives me\u2014that \u201cby my life\u201d I\nshould like to give a complete solution of these problems. But in\nreality I am incapable of doing this\u2014namely, the thing I do in the\ndream\u2014of sacrificing such dear persons to my ambition. With every\nrevelation of the true meaning of the dream, with which I am well\nacquainted, I should have been put to shame. Hence I am content with\nselecting a few of the elements of the dream, for interpretation, some\nhere, and others later on another page.\nThe scene in which I annihilate P. by a glance forms the centre of the\ndream. His eyes become strange and weirdly blue, and then he dissolves.\nThis scene is an unmistakable copy of one really experienced. I was a\ndemonstrator at the physiological institute, and began my service in the\nearly hours, and _Bruecke_ learned that I had been late several times in\ngetting to the school laboratory. So one morning he came promptly for\nthe opening of the class and waited for me. What he said to me was brief\nand to the point; but the words did not matter at all. What overwhelmed\nme was the terrible blue eyes through which he looked at me and before\nwhich I melted away\u2014as P. does in the dream, for P. has changed r\u00f4les\nwith him much to my relief. Anyone who remembers the eyes of the great\nmaster, which were wonderfully beautiful until old age, and who has ever\nseen him in anger, can easily imagine the emotions of the young\ntransgressor on that occasion.\nBut for a long time I was unable to account for the \u201cNon Vixit,\u201d with\nwhich I execute sentence in the dream, until I remembered that these two\nwords possessed such great distinctness in the dream, not because they\nwere heard or spoken, but because they were _seen_. Then I knew at once\nwhere they came from. On the pedestal of the statue of Emperor Joseph in\nthe Hofburg at Vienna, may be read the following beautiful words:\nSaluti patriae _vixit\nnon_ diu sed totus.\nI had culled from this inscription something which suited the one\ninimical train of thought in the dream thoughts and which now intended\nto mean: \u201cThat fellow has nothing to say, he is not living at all.\u201d And\nI now recalled that the dream was dreamed a few days after the unveiling\nof the memorial to _Fleischl_ in the arcades of the university, upon\nwhich occasion I had again seen _Bruecke\u2019s_ statue and must have thought\nwith regret (in the unconscious) how my highly gifted friend P. with his\ngreat devotion to science had forfeited his just claim to a statue in\nthese halls by his premature death. So I set up this memorial to him in\nthe dream; the first name of my friend P. is Joseph.[EP]\nAccording to the rules of dream interpretation, I should still not be\njustified in replacing _non vivit_, which I need, by _non vixit_, which\nis placed at my disposal by the recollection of the Joseph monument.\nSomething now calls my attention to the fact that in the dream scene,\ntwo trains of thought concerning my friend P. meet, one hostile, the\nother friendly\u2014of which the former is superficial, the latter veiled,\nand both are given representation in the same words: _non vixit_.\nBecause my friend P. has deserved well of science, I erect a statue to\nhim; but because he has been guilty of an evil wish (which is expressed\nat the end of the dream) I destroy him. I have here constructed a\nsentence of peculiar resonance, and I must have been influenced by some\nmodel. But where can I find similar antithesis, such a parallel between\ntwo opposite attitudes towards the same person, both claiming to be\nentirely valid, and yet both trying not to encroach upon each other?\nSuch a parallel is to be found in a single place, where, however, a deep\nimpression is made upon the reader\u2014in Brutus\u2019 speech of justification in\nShakespeare\u2019s _Julius C\u00e6sar_: \u201cAs C\u00e6sar loved me, I weep for him; as he\nwas fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him; but, as\nhe was ambitious, I slew him.\u201d Is not this which I have discovered, the\nsame sentence structure and thought contrast as in the dream thought? I\nthus play Brutus in the dream. If I could only find in the dream\nthoughts, one further trace of confirmation for this astonishing\ncollateral connection! I think the following might be such: My friend\ncomes to Vienna in _July_. This detail finds no support whatever in\nreality. To my knowledge my friend has never been in Vienna during the\nmonth of _July_. But the month of _July_ is named after _Julius C\u00e6sar_,\nand might therefore very well furnish the required allusion to the\nintermediary thought that I am playing the part of Brutus.[EQ]\nStrangely enough I once actually played the part of Brutus. I presented\nthe scene between Brutus and C\u00e6sar from Schiller\u2019s poems to an audience\nof children when I was a boy of fourteen years. I did this with my\nnephew, who was a year older than I, and who had come to us from\nEngland\u2014also a _revenant_\u2014for in him I recognised the playmate of my\nfirst childish years. Until the end of my third year we had been\ninseparable, had loved each other and scuffled with each other, and, as\nI have already intimated, this childish relation has constantly\ndetermined my later feelings in my intercourse with persons of my own\nage. My nephew John has since found many incarnations, which have\nrevivified first one aspect, then another, of this character which is so\nineradicably fixed in my unconscious memory. Occasionally he must have\ntreated me very badly and I must have shown courage before my tyrant,\nfor in later years I have often been told of the short speech with which\nI vindicated myself when my father\u2014his grandfather\u2014called me to account:\n\u201cI hit him because he hit me.\u201d This childish scene must be the one which\ncauses _non vivit_ to branch off into _non vixit_, for in the language\nof later childhood striking is called _wichsen_ (German, _wichsen_\u2014to\nsmear with shoe-polish, to tan, _i.e._, to flog); the dream activity\ndoes not hesitate to take advantage of such connections. My hostility\ntowards my friend P., which has so little foundation in reality\u2014he was\nfar superior to me, and might therefore have been a new edition of the\nplaymate of my childhood\u2014can certainly be traced to my complicated\nrelations with John during our infancy. I shall, however, return to this\ndream later.\n(_f_) _Absurd Dreams\u2014Intellectual Performances in the Dream_\nIn our interpretation of dreams thus far we have come upon the element\nof _absurdity_ in the dream-content so often that we must no longer\npostpone an investigation of its cause and significance. We remember, of\ncourse, that the absurdity of dreams has furnished the opponents of\ndream investigation with their chief argument for considering the dream\nnothing but the meaningless product of a reduced and fragmentary\nactivity of the mind.\nI begin with specimens in which the absurdity of the dream-content is\nonly apparent and immediately disappears when the dream is more\nthoroughly examined. There are a few dreams which\u2014accidentally one is at\nfirst inclined to think\u2014are concerned with the dead father of the\ndreamer.\nI. Here is the dream of a patient who had lost his father six years\nbefore:\n_A terrible accident has occurred to his father. He was riding in the\nnight train when a derailment took place, the seats came together, and\nhis head was crushed from side to side. The dreamer sees him lying on\nthe bed with a wound over his left eyebrow, which runs off vertically.\nThe dreamer is surprised that his father has had a misfortune (since he\nis dead already, as the dreamer adds in telling his dream). His father\u2019s\neyes are so clear._\nAccording to the standards prevailing in dream criticism, this\ndream-content would have to be explained in the following manner: At\nfirst, when the dreamer is picturing his father\u2019s misfortune, he has\nforgotten that his father has already been in his grave for years; in\nthe further course of the dream this memory comes to life, and causes\nhim to be surprised at his own dream even while he is still dreaming.\nAnalysis, however, teaches us that it is entirely useless to attempt\nsuch explanations. The dreamer had given an artist an order for a bust\nof his father, which he had inspected two days before the dream. This is\nthe thing which seems to him to have met with an _accident_. The\nsculptor has never seen the father, and is working from photographs\nwhich have been given him. On the very day before the dream the pious\nson had sent an old servant of the family to the studio in order to see\nwhether he would pass the same judgment upon the marble head, namely,\nthat it had turned out too _narrow from side to side_, from temple to\ntemple. Now follows the mass of recollections which has contributed to\nthe formation of this dream. The dreamer\u2019s father had a habit, whenever\nhe was harassed by business cares or family difficulties, of pressing\nhis temples with both hands, as though he were trying to compress his\nhead, which seemed to grow too large for him. When our dreamer was four\nyears old he was present when the accidental discharge of a pistol\nblackened his father\u2019s eyes (_his eyes are so clear_). While alive his\nfather had had a deep wrinkle at the place where the dream shows the\ninjury, whenever he was thoughtful or sad. The fact that in the dream\nthis wrinkle is replaced by a wound points to the second occasion of the\ndream. The dreamer had taken a photograph of his little daughter; the\nplate had fallen from his hand, and when picked up showed a crack that\nran like a vertical furrow across the forehead and reached as far as the\norbital curve. He could not then get the better of his superstitious\nforebodings, for, on the day before his mother\u2019s death, a photographic\nplate with her likeness had cracked as he was handling it.\nThus the absurdity of the dream is only the result of an inaccuracy of\nverbal expression, which does not take the trouble to distinguish the\nbust and the photograph from the original. We are all accustomed to say\nof a picture, \u201cDon\u2019t you think father is good?\u201d Of course the appearance\nof absurdity in this dream might easily have been avoided. If it were\npermissible to pass judgment after a single experience, one might be\ntempted to say that this semblance of absurdity is admitted or desired.\nII. Here is another very similar example from my own dreams (I lost my\nfather in the year 1896):\n_After his death my father has been politically active among the\nMagyars, and has united them into a political body_; to accompany which\nI see a little indistinct picture: _a crowd of people as in the\nReichstag; a person who is standing on one or two benches, others round\nabout him. I remember that he looked very like Garibaldi on his\ndeath-bed, and I am glad that this promise has really come true._\nThis is certainly absurd enough. It was dreamed at the time that the\nHungarians got into a lawless condition, through Parliamentary\nobstruction, and passed through the crisis from which Koloman Szell\ndelivered them. The trivial circumstance that the scene beheld in the\ndream consists of such little pictures is not without significance for\nthe explanation of this element. The usual visual representation of our\nthoughts results in pictures which impress us as being life-size; my\ndream picture, however, is the reproduction of a wood-cut inserted in\nthe text of an illustrated history of Austria, representing Maria\nTheresa in the Reichstag of Pressburg\u2014the famous scene of \u201cMoriamur pro\nrege nostro.\u201d[ER] Like Maria Theresa, my father, in the dream, stands\nsurrounded by the multitude; but he is standing on one or two benches,\nand thus like a judge on the bench. (He has _united_ them\u2014here the\nintermediary is the phrase, \u201cWe shall need no _judge_.\u201d) Those of us who\nstood around the death-bed of my father actually noticed that he looked\nmuch like Garibaldi. He had a _post-mortem_ rise of temperature, his\ncheeks shone redder and redder ... involuntarily we continue: \u201cAnd\nbehind him lay in phantom radiance that which subdues us all\u2014the common\nthing.\u201d\nThis elevation of our thoughts prepares us for having to deal with this\nvery \u201ccommon thing.\u201d The _post-mortem_ feature of the rise in\ntemperature corresponds to the words, \u201cafter his death\u201d in the dream\ncontent. The most agonising of his sufferings had been a complete\nparalysis of the intestines (_obstruction_), which set in during the\nlast weeks. All sorts of disrespectful thoughts are connected with this.\nA man of my own age who had lost his father while he was still at the\nGymnasium, upon which occasion I was profoundly moved and tendered him\nmy friendship, once told me, with derision, about the distress of a lady\nrelative whose father had died on the street and had been brought home,\nwhere it turned out upon undressing the corpse, that at the moment of\ndeath, or _post-mortem_, an evacuation of the bowels had taken place.\nThe daughter of the dead man was profoundly unhappy at having this ugly\ndetail stain her memory of her father. We have now penetrated to the\nwish that is embodied in this dream. _To stand before one\u2019s children\npure and great after one\u2019s death_, who would not wish that? What has\nbecome of the absurdity of the dream? The appearance of it has been\ncaused only by the fact that a perfectly permissible mode of speech\u2014in\nthe case of which we are accustomed to ignore the absurdity that happens\nto exist between its parts\u2014has been faithfully represented in the dream.\nHere, too, we are unable to deny that the semblance of absurdity is one\nwhich is desired and has been purposely brought about.[ES]\nIII. In the example which I now cite I can detect the dream activity in\nthe act of purposely manufacturing an absurdity for which there is no\noccasion at all in the subject-matter. It is taken from the dream that I\nhad as a result of meeting Count Thun before my vacation trip. \u201c_I am\nriding in a one-horse carriage, and give orders to drive to a railway\nstation. \u2018Of course I cannot ride with you on the railway line itself,\u2019\nI say, after the driver made an objection as though I had tired him out;\nat the same time it seems as though I had already driven with him for a\ndistance which one usually rides on the train._\u201d For this confused and\nsenseless story the analysis gives the following explanation: During the\nday I had hired a one-horse carriage which was to take me to a remote\nstreet in Dornbach. The driver, however, did not know the way, and kept\non driving in the manner of those good people until I noticed the fact\nand showed him the way, not sparing him a few mocking remarks withal.\nFrom this driver a train of thought led to the aristocratic personage\nwhom I was destined to meet later. For the present I shall only remark\nthat what strikes us middle-class plebeians about the aristocracy is\nthat they like to put themselves in the driver\u2019s seat. Does not Count\nThun guide the Austrian car of state? The next sentence in the dream,\nhowever, refers to my brother, whom I identify with the driver of the\none-horse carriage. I had this year refused to take the trip through\nItaly with him (\u201cof course I cannot ride with you on the railway line\nitself\u201d), and this refusal was a sort of punishment for his wonted\ncomplaint that I usually tired him out on this trip (which gets into the\ndream unchanged) by making him take hurried trips and see too many nice\nthings in one day. That evening my brother had accompanied me to the\nrailroad station, but shortly before getting there had jumped out, at\nthe state railway division of the Western Station, in order to take a\ntrain to Purkersdorf. I remarked to him that he could stay with me a\nlittle longer, inasmuch as he did not go to Purkersdorf by the state\nrailway but by the Western Railway. This is how it happens that in the\ndream I rode in the wagon a distance _which one usually rides on the\ntrain_. In reality, however, it was just the opposite; I told my\nbrother: The distance which you ride on the state railway you could ride\nin my company on the Western Railway. The whole confusion of the dream\nis therefore produced by my inserting in the dream the word \u201cwagon\u201d\ninstead of \u201cstate railway,\u201d which, to be sure, does good service in\nbringing together the driver and my brother. I then find in the dream\nsome nonsense which seems hardly straightened out by my explanation, and\nwhich almost forms a contradiction to my earlier speech (\u201cOf course I\ncannot ride with you on the railway line itself\u201d). But as I have no\noccasion whatever for confounding the state railway with the one-horse\ncarriage, I must have intentionally formed the whole puzzling story in\nthe dream in this way.\nBut with what intention? We shall now learn what the absurdity in the\ndream signifies, and the motives which admitted it or created it. The\nsolution of the mystery in the case in question is as follows: In the\ndream I needed something absurd and incomprehensible in connection with\n\u201criding\u201d (Fahren) because in the dream thoughts I had a certain judgment\nwhich required representation. On an evening at the house of the\nhospitable and clever lady who appears in another scene of the same\ndream as the \u201chostess,\u201d I heard two riddles which I could not solve. As\nthey were known to the other members of the party, I presented a\nsomewhat ludicrous figure in my unsuccessful attempts to find a\nsolution. They were two equivoques turning on the words \u201cNachkommen\u201d (to\ncome after\u2014offspring) and \u201cvorfahren\u201d (to ride in advance\u2014forefathers,\nancestry). They read as follows:\nThe coachman does it\nAt the master\u2019s behest;\nEveryone has it,\nIn the grave does it rest.\n(Ancestry.)\nIt was confusing to find half of the second riddle identical with the\nfirst.\nThe coachman does it\nAt the master\u2019s behest;\nNot everyone has it,\nIn the cradle does it rest.\n(Offspring.)\nAs I had seen Count Thun ride in advance (vorfahren), so high and\nmighty, and had merged into the Figaro-mood which finds the merit of\naristocratic gentlemen in the fact that they have taken the trouble to\nbe born (Nachkommen\u2014to become offspring), the two riddles became\nintermediary thoughts for the dream-work. As aristocrats can be readily\nconfounded with coachmen, and as coachmen were in our country formerly\ncalled brothers-in-law, the work of condensation could employ my brother\nin the same representation. But the dream thought at work in the\nbackground was as follows: _It is nonsense to be proud of one\u2019s\nancestry. (Vorfahren.) I would rather be myself an ancestor. (Vorfahr.)_\nFor the sake of this judgment, \u201cit is nonsense,\u201d we have the nonsense in\nthe dream. We can now also solve the last riddle in this obscure passage\nof the dream, namely, that I have already driven before (vorher\ngefahren, vorgefahren) with the coachman.\nThus the dream is made absurd if there occurs as one of the elements in\nthe dream thoughts the judgment \u201c_That is nonsense_,\u201d and in general if\ndisdain and criticism are the motives for one of the trains of\nunconscious thought. Hence absurdity becomes one of the means by which\nthe dream activity expresses contradiction, as it does by reversing a\nrelation in the material between the dream thoughts and dream content,\nand by utilising sensations of motor impediment. But absurdity in the\ndream is not simply to be translated by \u201cno\u201d; it is rather intended to\nreproduce the disposition of the dream thoughts, this being to show\nmockery and ridicule along with the contradiction. It is only for this\npurpose that the dream activity produces anything ridiculous. Here again\nit transforms _a part of the latent content into a manifest form_.[ET]\nAs a matter of fact we have already met with a convincing example of the\nsignificance of an absurd dream. The dream, interpreted without\nanalysis, of the Wagnerian performance lasting until 7.45 in the\nmorning, in which the orchestra is conducted from a tower, &c. (see p.\n316) is apparently trying to say: It is a _crazy_ world and an _insane_\nsociety. He who deserves a thing doesn\u2019t get it, and he who doesn\u2019t care\nfor anything has it\u2014and in this she means to compare her fate with that\nof her cousin. The fact that dreams concerning a dead father were the\nfirst to furnish us with examples of absurdity in dreams is by no means\nan accident. The conditions necessary for the creations of absurd dreams\nare here grouped together in a typical manner. The authority belonging\nto the father has at an early age aroused the criticism of the child,\nand the strict demands he has made have caused the child to pay\nparticularly close attention to every weakness of the father for its own\nextenuation; but the piety with which the father\u2019s personality is\nsurrounded in our thoughts, especially after his death, increases the\ncensorship which prevents the expressions of this criticism from\nbecoming conscious.\nIV. The following is another absurd dream about a dead father:\n_I receive a notice from the common council of my native city concerning\nthe costs of a confinement in the hospital in the year 1851, which was\nnecessitated by an attack from which I suffered. I make sport of the\nmatter, for, in the first place, I was not yet alive in the year 1851,\nand, in the second place, my father, to whom the notice might refer, is\nalready dead. I go to him in the adjoining room, where he is lying on a\nbed, and tell him about it. To my astonishment he recalls that in that\nyear\u20141851\u2014he was once drunk and had to be locked up or confined. It was\nwhen he was working for the house of T\u2014\u2014. \u201cThen you drank, too?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYou married soon after?\u201d I figure that I was born in 1856, which\nappears to me as though immediately following._\nIn view of the preceding discussion, we shall translate the insistence\nwith which this dream exhibits its absurdities as the sure sign of a\nparticularly embittered and passionate controversy in the dream\nthoughts. With all the more astonishment, however, we note that in this\ndream the controversy is waged openly, and the father designated as the\nperson against whom the satire is directed. This openness seems to\ncontradict our assumption of a censor as operative in the dream\nactivity. We may say in explanation, however, that here the father is\nonly an interposed person, while the conflict is carried on with another\none, who makes his appearance in the dream by means of a single\nallusion. While the dream usually treats of revolt against other\npersons, behind which the father is concealed, the reverse is true here;\nthe father serves as the man of straw to represent others, and hence the\ndream dares thus openly to concern itself with a person who is usually\nhallowed, because there is present the certain knowledge that he is not\nin reality intended. We learn of this condition of affairs by\nconsidering the occasion of the dream. Now, it occurred after I had\nheard that an older colleague, whose judgment is considered infallible,\nhad expressed disapproval and astonishment at the fact that one of my\npatients was then continuing psychoanalytical work with me for the fifth\nyear. The introductory sentences of the dream point with transparent\ndisguise to the fact that this colleague had for a time taken over the\nduties which my father could no longer perform (_expenses, fees at the\nhospital_); and when our friendly relations came to be broken I was\nthrown into the same conflict of feelings which arises in the case of\nmisunderstanding between father and son in view of the part played by\nthe father and his earlier functions. The dream thoughts now bitterly\nresent the reproach that I _am not making better progress_, which\nextends itself from the treatment of this patient to other things. Does\nthis colleague know anyone who can get on faster? Does he not know that\nconditions of this sort are usually incurable and last for life? What\nare four or five years in comparison to a whole life, especially when\nlife has been made so much easier for the patient during the treatment?\nThe impression of absurdity in this dream is brought about largely by\nthe fact that sentences from different divisions of the dream thoughts\nare strung together without any reconciling transition. Thus the\nsentence, _I go to him in the adjoining room, &c._, leaves the subject\ndealt with in the preceding sentences, and faithfully reproduces the\ncircumstances under which I told my father about my marriage engagement.\nThus the dream is trying to remind me of the noble disinterestedness\nwhich the old man showed at that time, and to put it in contrast with\nthe conduct of another, a new person. I now perceive that the dream is\nallowed to make sport of my father for the reason that in the dream\nthought he is held up as an example to another man, in full recognition\nof his merit. It is in the nature of every censorship that it permits\nthe telling of untruth about forbidden things rather than truth. The\nnext sentence, in which my father remembers having _once been drunk_,\nand having been _locked up for it_, also contains nothing which is\nactually true of my father. The person whom he covers is here a no less\nimportant one than the great Meynert, in whose footsteps I followed with\nsuch great veneration, and whose attitude towards me was changed into\nundisguised hostility after a short period of indulgence. The dream\nrecalls to me his own statement that in his youth he was addicted to the\n_chloroform_ habit, and that for this he had to enter a sanatorium. It\nrecalls also a second experience with him shortly before his death. I\ncarried on an embittered literary controversy with him concerning\nhysteria in the male, the existence of which he denied, and when I\nvisited him in his last illness and asked him how he felt, he dwelt upon\nthe details of his condition and concluded with the words: \u201cYou know, I\nhave always been one of the prettiest cases of masculine hysteria.\u201d\nThus, to my satisfaction, and _to my astonishment_, he admitted what he\nhad so long and so stubbornly opposed. But the fact that in this scene I\ncan use my father to cover Meynert is based not upon the analogy which\nhas been found to exist between the two persons, but upon the slight,\nbut quite adequate, representation of a conditional sentence occurring\nin the dream thoughts, which in full would read as follows: \u201cOf course\nif I were of the second generation, the son of a professor or of a\ncourt-councillor, I should have _progressed more rapidly_.\u201d In the dream\nI now make a court-councillor and a professor of my father. The most\nobvious and most annoying absurdity of the dream lies in the treatment\nof the date 1851, which seems to me to be hardly distinguishable from\n1856, as though _a difference of five years would signify nothing\nwhatever_. But it is just this idea of the dream thoughts which requires\nexpression. _Four or five years_\u2014that is the length of time which I\nenjoyed the support of the colleague mentioned at the outset; but it is\nalso the time during which I kept my bride waiting before I married her;\nand, through a coincidence that is eagerly taken advantage of by the\ndream thoughts, it is also the time during which I am now keeping one of\nmy best patients waiting for the completion of his cure. \u201c_What are five\nyears?_\u201d ask the dream thoughts. \u201c_That is no time at all for me\u2014that\ndoesn\u2019t come into consideration._ I have time enough ahead of me, and\njust as what you didn\u2019t want to believe came true at last, so I shall\naccomplish this also.\u201d Besides the number 51, when separated from the\nnumber of the century, is determined in still another manner and in an\nopposite sense; for which reason it occurs in the dream again. Fifty-one\nis an age at which a man seems particularly exposed to danger, at which\nI have seen many of my colleagues suddenly die, and among them one who\nhad been appointed to a professorship a few days before, after he had\nbeen waiting a long time.\nV. Another absurd dream which plays with figures, runs as follows:\n_One of my acquaintances, Mr. M., has been attacked in an essay by no\nless a person than Goethe, with justifiable vehemence, we all think. Mr.\nM. has, of course, been crushed by this attack. He complains of it\nbitterly at a dinner party; but he says that his veneration for Goethe\nhas not suffered from this personal experience. I try to find some\nexplanation of the chronological relations, which seem improbable to me.\nGoethe died in 1832; since his attack upon M. must of course have taken\nplace earlier, Mr. M. was at the time a very young man. It seems\nplausible to me that he was 18 years old. But I do not know exactly what\nyear it is at present, and so the whole calculation lapses into\nobscurity. The attack, moreover, is contained in Goethe\u2019s well-known\nessay entitled \u201cNature.\u201d_\nWe shall soon find means to justify the nonsense of this dream. Mr. M.,\nwith whom I became acquainted _at a dinner-party_, had recently\nrequested me to examine his brother, who showed signs of _paralytic\ninsanity_. The conjecture was right; the painful thing about this visit\nwas that the patient exposed his brother by alluding to his youthful\npranks when there was no occasion in the conversation for his doing so.\nI had asked the patient to tell me the year of his birth, and had got\nhim to make several small calculations in order to bring out the\nweakness of his memory\u2014all of which tests he passed fairly well. I see\nnow that I am acting like a paralytic in the dream (_I do not know\nexactly what year it is at present_). Other subject-matter in the dream\nis drawn from another recent source. The editor of a medical journal, a\nfriend of mine, had accepted for his paper a very unfavourable, a\n\u201c_crushing_,\u201d criticism of the last book of my friend Fl. of Berlin, the\nauthor of which was a very _youthful_ reviewer, who was not very\ncompetent to pass judgment. I thought I had a right to interfere, and\ncalled the editor to account; he keenly regretted the acceptance of the\ncriticism, but would not promise redress. Thereupon I broke off\nrelations with the journal, and in my letter of resignation expressed\nthe hope that _our personal relations would not suffer from the\nincident_. The third source of this dream is an account given by a\nfemale patient\u2014it was fresh in my memory at the time\u2014of the mental\ndisease of her brother who had fallen into a frenzy, crying \u201cNature,\nNature.\u201d The physicians in attendance thought that the cry was derived\nfrom a reading of Goethe\u2019s beautiful _essay_, and that it pointed to\noverwork in the patient in the study of natural philosophy. I thought\nrather of the sexual sense in which even less cultured people with us\nuse the word \u201cNature,\u201d and the fact that the unfortunate man later\nmutilated his genitals seemed to show that I was not far wrong. Eighteen\nyears was the age of this patient at the time when the attack of frenzy\noccurred.\nIf I add further that the book of my friend so severely criticised (\u201cIt\nis a question whether the author is crazy or we are\u201d had been the\nopinion of another critic) treats of the _temporal relations of life_\nand refers the duration of Goethe\u2019s life to the multiple of a number\nsignificant from the point of view of biology, it will readily be\nadmitted that I am putting myself in the place of my friend in the\ndream. (_I try to find some explanation of the chronological\nrelations._) But I behave like a paralytic, and the dream revels in\nabsurdity. This means, then, as the dream thoughts say ironically. \u201cOf\ncourse he is the fool, the lunatic, and you are the man of genius who\nknows better. Perhaps, however, it is the other way around?\u201d Now, this\nother way around is explicitly represented in the dream, in that Goethe\nhas attacked the young man, which is absurd, while it is perfectly\npossible even to-day for a young fellow to attack the immortal Goethe,\nand in that I figure from the year of Goethe\u2019s death, while I caused the\nparalytic to calculate from the year of his birth.\nBut I have already promised to show that every dream is the result of\negotistical motives. Accordingly, I must account for the fact that in\nthis dream I make my friend\u2019s cause my own and put myself in his place.\nMy rational conviction in waking thought is not adequate to do this.\nNow, the story of the eighteen-year-old patient and of the various\ninterpretations of his cry, \u201cNature,\u201d alludes to my having brought\nmyself into opposition to most physicians by claiming sexual etiology\nfor the psychoneuroses. I may say to myself: \u201cThe same kind of criticism\nyour friend met with you will meet with too, and have already met with\nto some extent,\u201d and now I may replace the \u201che\u201d in the dream thoughts by\n\u201cwe.\u201d \u201cYes, you are right; we two are the fools.\u201d That _mea res agitur_,\nis clearly shown by the mention of the short, incomparably beautiful\nessay of Goethe, for it was a public reading of this essay which induced\nme to study the natural science while I was still undecided in the\ngraduating class of the Gymnasium.\nVI. I am also bound to show of another dream in which my ego does not\noccur that it is egotistic. On page 228 I mentioned a short dream in\nwhich Professor M. says: \u201cMy son, the myopic ...\u201d; and I stated that\nthis was only a preliminary dream to another one, in which I play a\npart. Here is the main dream, omitted above, which challenges us to\nexplain its absurd and unintelligible word-formation.\n_On account of some happenings or other in the city of Rome it is\nnecessary for the children to flee, and this they do. The scene is then\nlaid before a gate, a two-winged gate in antique style (the Porta Romana\nin Siena, as I know while I am still dreaming). I am sitting on the edge\nof a well, and am very sad; I almost weep. A feminine person\u2014nurse,\nnun\u2014brings out the two boys and hands them over to their father, who is\nnot myself. The elder of the two is distinctly my eldest son, and I do\nnot see the face of the other; the woman who brings the boy asks him for\na parting kiss. She is distinguished by a red nose. The boy denies her\nthe kiss, but says to her, extending his hand to her in parting, \u201cAuf\nGeseres,\u201d and to both of us (or to one of us) \u201cAuf Ungeseres.\u201d I have\nthe idea, that the latter indicates an advantage._\nThis dream is built upon a tangle of thoughts induced by a play I saw at\nthe theatre, called _Das neue Ghetto_ (\u201cThe New Ghetto.\u201d) The Jewish\nquestion, anxiety about the future of my children who cannot be given a\nnative country of their own, anxiety about bringing them up so that they\nmay have the right of native citizens\u2014all these features may easily be\nrecognised in the accompanying dream thoughts.\n\u201cWe sat by the waters of Babylon and wept.\u201d Siena, like Rome, is famous\nfor its beautiful fountains. In the dream I must find a substitute of\nsome kind for Rome (_cf._ p. 163) in localities which are known to me.\nNear the Porta Romana of Siena we saw a large, brightly illuminated\nbuilding, which we found to be the Manicomio, the insane asylum. Shortly\nbefore the dream I had heard that a co-religionist had been forced to\nresign a position at a state asylum which he had secured with great\neffort.\nOur interest is aroused by the speech: \u201c_Auf Geseres_\u201d\u2014where we might\nexpect, from the situation maintained throughout the dream, \u201c_Auf\nWiedersehen_\u201d (_Au revoir_)\u2014and by its quite meaningless opposite, \u201c_Auf\nUngeseres_.\u201d\nAccording to information I have received from Hebrew scholars, _Geseres_\nis a genuine Hebrew word derived from the verb _goiser_, and may best be\nrendered by \u201cordained sufferings, fated disaster.\u201d From its use in the\nJewish jargon one might think it signified \u201cwailing and lamentation.\u201d\n_Ungeseres_ is a coinage of my own and first attracts my attention; but\nfor the present it baffles me. The little observation at the end of the\ndream, that _Ungeseres_ indicates an advantage over _Geseres_ opens the\nway to the associations and to an explanation. The same relation holds\ngood with caviare; the unsalted kind[EU] is more highly prized than the\nsalted. Caviare to the general, \u201cnoble passions\u201d; herein lies concealed\na joking allusion to a member of my household, of whom I hope\u2014for she is\nyounger than I\u2014that she will watch over the future of my children; this,\ntoo, agrees with the fact that another member of my household, our\nworthy nurse, is clearly indicated in the nurse (or nun) of the dream.\nBut a connecting link is wanting between the pair, _salted_ and\n_unsalted_, and _Geseres\u2014ungeseres_. This is to be found in _soured and\nunsoured_. In their flight or exodus out of Egypt, the children of\nIsrael did not have time to allow their bread to be leavened, and in\nmemory of the event to this day they eat unsoured bread at Easter time.\nHere I can also find room for the sudden notion which came to me in this\npart of the analysis. I remembered how we promenaded about the city of\nBreslau, which was strange to us, at the end of the Easter holidays, my\nfriend from Berlin and I. A little girl asked me to tell her the way to\na certain street; I had to tell her I did not know it, whereupon I\nremarked to my friend, \u201cI hope that later on in life the little one will\nshow more perspicacity in selecting the persons by whom she allows\nherself to be guided.\u201d Shortly afterwards a sign caught my eye: \u201cDr.\n_Herod_, office hours....\u201d I said to myself: \u201cI hope this colleague does\nnot happen to be a children\u2019s specialist.\u201d Meanwhile my friend had been\ndeveloping his views on the biological significance of _bilateral_\nsymmetry, and had begun a sentence as follows: \u201cIf we had but one eye in\nthe middle of our foreheads like _Cyclops_....\u201d This leads us to the\nspeech of the professor in the preliminary dream: \u201cMy son, the\n_myopic_.\u201d And now I have been led to the chief source for _Geseres_.\nMany years ago, when this son of Professor M., who is to-day an\nindependent thinker, was still sitting on his school-bench, he\ncontracted a disease of the eye, which the doctor declared gave cause\nfor anxiety. He was of the opinion that as long as it remained in one\neye it would not matter; if, however, it should extend to the other eye,\nit would be serious. The disease healed in the one eye without leaving\nany bad effects; shortly afterwards, however, its symptoms actually\nappeared in the other eye. The terrified mother of the boy immediately\nsummoned the physician to the seclusion of her country resort. But he\ntook _another view_ of the matter. \u201c_What sort of \u2018Geseres\u2019 is this you\nare making?_\u201d he said to his mother with impatience. \u201cIf one side got\nwell, the other side will get well too.\u201d And so it turned out.\nAnd now as to the connection between this and myself and those dear to\nme. The school-bench upon which the son of Professor M. learned his\nfirst lessons has become the property of my eldest son\u2014it was given to\nhis mother-into whose lips I put the words of parting in the dream. One\nof the wishes that can be attached to this transference may now easily\nbe guessed. This school-bench is intended by its construction to guard\nthe child from becoming shortsighted and one-sided. Hence, myopia (and\nbehind the Cyclops) and the discussion about _bilateralism_. The concern\nabout one-sidedness is of two-fold signification; along with the bodily\none-sidedness, that of intellectual development may be referred to. Does\nit not seem as though the scene in the dream, with all its madness, were\nputting its negative on just this anxiety? After the child has said his\nword of parting _on the one side_, he calls out its opposite on the\n_other side_, as though in order to establish an equilibrium. _He is\nacting, as it were, in obedience to bilateral symmetry!_\nThus the dream frequently has the profoundest meaning in places where it\nseems most absurd. In all ages those who had something to say and were\nunable to say it without danger to themselves gladly put on the cap and\nbells. The listener for whom the forbidden saying was intended was more\nlikely to tolerate it if he was able to laugh at it, and to flatter\nhimself with the comment that what he disliked was obviously something\nabsurd. The dream proceeds in reality just as the prince does in the\nplay who must counterfeit the fool, and hence the same thing may be said\nof the dream which Hamlet says of himself, substituting an\nunintelligible witticism for the real conditions: \u201cI am but mad\nnorth-north-west; when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a\nhandsaw.\u201d[EV]\nThus my solution of the problem of the absurdity of dreams is that the\ndream thoughts are never absurd\u2014at least not those belonging to the\ndreams of sane persons\u2014and that the dream activity produces absurd\ndreams and dreams with individual absurd elements if criticism,\nridicule, and derision in the dream thoughts are to be represented by it\nin its manner of expression. My next concern is to show that the dream\nactivity is primarily brought about by the co-operation of the three\nfactors which have been mentioned\u2014and of a fourth one which remains to\nbe cited\u2014that it accomplishes nothing short of a transposition of the\ndream thoughts, observing the three conditions which are prescribed for\nit, and that the question whether the mind operates in the dream with\nall its faculties, or only with a portion of them, is deprived of its\ncogency and is inapplicable to the actual circumstances. But since there\nare plenty of dreams in which judgments are passed, criticisms made, and\nfacts recognised, in which astonishment at some single element of the\ndream appears, and arguments and explanations are attempted, I must meet\nthe objections which may be inferred from these occurrences by the\ncitation of selected examples.\nMy answer is as follows: _Everything in the dream which occurs as an\napparent exercise of the critical faculty is to be regarded, not as an\nintellectual accomplishment of the dream activity, but as belonging to\nthe material of the dream thoughts, and it has found its way from them\nas a finished structure to the manifest dream content_. I may go even\nfurther than this. Even the judgments which are passed upon the dream as\nit is remembered after awakening and the feelings which are aroused by\nthe reproduction of the dream, belong in good part to the latent dream\ncontent, and must be fitted into their place in the interpretation of\nthe dream.\nI. A striking example of this I have already given. A female patient\ndoes not wish to relate her dream because it is too vague. She has seen\na person in the dream, and does not know whether it is her husband or\nher father. Then follows a second dream fragment in which there occurs a\n\u201cmanure-can,\u201d which gives rise to the following reminiscence. As a young\nhousewife, she once jokingly declared in the presence of a young\nrelative who frequented the house that her next care would be to procure\na new manure-can. The next morning one was sent to her, but it was\nfilled with lilies of the valley. This part of the dream served to\nrepresent the saying, \u201cNot grown on your own manure.\u201d[EW] When we\ncomplete the analysis we find that in the dream thoughts it is a matter\nof the after-effects of a story heard in youth, to the effect that a\ngirl had given birth to a child _concerning whom it was not clear who\nwas the real father_. The dream representation here goes over into the\nwaking thought, and allows one element of the dream thoughts to be\nrepresented by a judgment expressed in the waking state upon the whole\ndream.\nII. A similar case: One of my patients has a dream which seems\ninteresting to him, for he says to himself immediately after awakening:\n\u201c_I must tell that to the doctor_.\u201d The dream is analysed, and shows the\nmost distinct allusion to an affair in which he had become involved\nduring the treatment, and of which he had decided \u201c_to tell me\nnothing_.\u201d[EX]\nIII. Here is a third example from my own experience:\n_I go to the hospital with P. through a region in which houses and\ngardens occur. With this comes the idea that I have already seen this\nregion in dreams several times. I do not know my way very well; P. shows\nme a way which leads through a corner to a restaurant (a room, not a\ngarden); here I ask for Mrs. Doni, and I hear that she is living in the\nbackground in a little room with three children. I go there, and while\non the way I meet an indistinct person with my two little girls, whom I\ntake with me after I have stood with them for a while. A kind of\nreproach against my wife for having left them there._\nUpon awakening I feel great _satisfaction_, the cause for this being the\nfact that I am now going to learn from the analysis what is meant by the\nidea \u201c_I have already dreamed of that_.\u201d[EY] But the analysis of the\ndream teaches me nothing on the subject; it only shows me that the\nsatisfaction belongs to the latent dream content, and not to my judgment\nupon the dream. It is _satisfaction over the fact that I have had\nchildren by my marriage_. P. is a person in whose company I walked the\npath of life for a certain space, but who has since far outdistanced me\nsocially and materially\u2014whose marriage, however, has remained childless.\nThe two occasions for the dream furnishing the proof of this may be\nfound by means of complete analysis. On the previous day I had read in\nthe paper the obituary notice of a certain Mrs. Dona A\u2014\u2014y (out of which\nI make Doni), who had died in childbirth; I was told by my wife that the\ndead woman had been nursed by the same midwife she herself had had at\nthe birth of our two youngest boys. The name Dona had caught my\nattention, for I had recently found it for the first time in an English\nnovel. The other occasion for the dream may be found in the date on\nwhich it was dreamed; it was on the night before the birthday of my\neldest boy, who, it seems, is poetically gifted.\nIV. The same satisfaction remained with me after awakening from the\nabsurd dream that my father, after his death, had played a political\npart among the Magyars, and it is motivated by a continuance of the\nfeeling which accompanied the last sentence of the dream: \u201c_I remember\nthat on his death-bed he looked so much like Garibaldi, and I am glad\nthat it has really come true. (Here belongs a forgotten continuation.)_\u201d\nI can now supply from the analysis what belongs in this gap of the\ndream. It is the mention of my second boy, to whom I have given the\nfirst name of a great historical personage, who attracted me powerfully\nduring my boyhood, especially during my stay in England. I had to wait\nfor a year after making up my mind to use this name in case the expected\nchild should be a son, and I greeted him with it _in high satisfaction_\nas soon as he was born. It is easy to see how the father\u2019s lust for\ngreatness is transferred in his thoughts to his children; it will\nreadily be believed that this is one of the ways in which the\nsuppression of this lust which becomes necessary in life is brought\nabout. The little fellow won a place in the text of this dream by virtue\nof the fact that the same accident\u2014quite pardonable in a child or a\ndying person\u2014of soiling his clothes had happened to him. With this may\nbe compared the allusion \u201c_Stuhlrichter_\u201d (judge on the stool-bench,\n_i.e._ presiding judge) and the wish of the dream: To stand before one\u2019s\nchildren great and pure.\nV. I am now called upon to find expressions of judgment which remain in\nthe dream itself, and are not retained in or transferred to our waking\nthoughts, and I shall consider it a great relief if I may find examples\nin dreams, which have already been cited for other purposes. The dream\nabout Goethe\u2019s attacking Mr. M. seems to contain a considerable number\nof acts of judgment. _I try to find some explanation of the\nchronological relations, which seem improbable to me._ Does not this\nlook like a critical impulse directed against the nonsensical idea that\nGoethe should have made a literary attack upon a young man of my\nacquaintance? \u201c_It seems plausible to me_ that he was 18 years old.\u201d\nThat sounds quite like the result of a dull-witted calculation; and \u201c_I\ndo not know exactly what year it is_\u201d would be an example of uncertainty\nor doubt in the dream.\nBut I know from analysis that these acts of judgment, which seem to have\nbeen performed in the dream for the first time, admit of a different\nconstruction in the light of which they become indispensable for\ninterpreting the dream, and at the same time every absurdity is avoided.\nWith the sentence, \u201c_I try to find some explanation of the chronological\nrelations_,\u201d I put myself in the place of my friend who is actually\ntrying to explain the chronological relations of life. The sentence then\nloses its significance as a judgment that objects to the nonsense of the\nprevious sentences. The interposition, \u201c_which seems improbable to me_,\u201d\nbelongs to the subsequent \u201c_it seems plausible to me_.\u201d In about the\nsame words I had answered the lady who told me the story of her\nbrother\u2019s illness: \u201c_It seems improbable to me_ that the cry of \u2018Nature,\nNature,\u2019 had anything to do with Goethe; _it appears much more\nplausible_ that it had the sexual significance which is known to you.\u201d\nTo be sure, a judgment has been passed here, not, however, in the dream\nbut in reality, on an occasion which is remembered and utilised by the\ndream thoughts. The dream content appropriates this judgment like any\nother fragment of the dream thoughts.\nThe numeral 18, with which the judgment in the dream is meaninglessly\nconnected, still preserves a trace of the context from which the real\njudgment was torn. Finally, \u201c_I am not certain what year it is_\u201d is\nintended for nothing else than to carry out my identification with the\nparalytic, in the examination of whom this point of confirmation had\nactually been established.\nIn the solution of these apparent acts of judgment, in the dream, it may\nbe well to call attention to the rule of interpretation which says that\nthe coherence which is fabricated in the dream between its constituent\nparts is to be disregarded as specious and unessential, and that every\ndream element must be taken by itself and traced to its source. The\ndream is a conglomeration, which is to be broken up into its elements\nfor the purposes of investigation. But other circumstances call our\nattention to the fact that a psychic force is expressed in dreams which\nestablishes this apparent coherence\u2014that is to say, which subjects the\nmaterial that is obtained by the dream activity to a _secondary\nelaboration_. We are here confronted with manifestations of this force,\nupon which we shall later fix our attention as being the fourth of the\nfactors which take part in the formation of the dream.\nVI. I select other examples of critical activity in the dreams which\nhave already been cited. In the absurd dream about the communication\nfrom the common council I ask the question: \u201c_You married shortly after?\nI figure that I was born in 1856, which appears to me as though\nfollowing immediately_.\u201d This quite takes the form of an _inference_. My\nfather married shortly after his attack in the year 1851; I am the\noldest son, born in 1856; this agrees perfectly. We know that this\ninference has been interpolated by the wish-fulfilment, and that the\nsentence which dominates the dream thoughts is to the following effect:\n_4 or 5 years, that is no time at all, that need not enter the\ncalculation_. But every part of this chain of inferences is to be\ndetermined from the dream thoughts in a different manner, both as to its\ncontent and as to its form. It is the patient\u2014about whose endurance my\ncolleague complains\u2014who intends to marry immediately after the close of\nthe treatment. The manner in which I deal with my father in the dream\nrecalls an _inquest_ or _examination_, and with that the person of a\nuniversity instructor who was in the habit of taking a complete list of\ncredentials at the enrolment of his class: \u201cYou were born when?\u201d In\n1856. \u201cPatre?\u201d Then the applicant gave the first name of his father with\na Latin ending, and we students assumed that the Aulic Councillor drew\n_inferences_ from the first name of the father which the name of the\nenrolled student would not always have supplied. According to this, the\n_drawing of inferences_ in the dream would be merely a repetition of the\n_drawing of inferences_ which appears as part of the subject-matter in\nthe dream thoughts. From this we learn something new. If an inference\noccurs in the dream content, it invariably comes from the dream\nthoughts; it may be contained in these as a bit of remembered material,\nor it may serve as a logical connective in a series of dream thoughts.\nIn any case an inference in the dream represents an inference in the\ndream thoughts.[EZ]\nThe analysis of this dream should be continued here. With the inquest of\nthe Professor there is connected the recollection of an index (published\nin Latin during my time) of the university students; also of my course\nof studies. The _five years_ provided for the study of medicine were as\nusual not enough for me. I worked along unconcernedly in the succeeding\nyears; in the circle of my acquaintances I was considered a loafer, and\nthere was doubt as to whether I would \u201cget through.\u201d Then all at once I\ndecided to take my examinations; and I got \u201cthrough,\u201d _in spite of the\npostponement_. This is a new confirmation of the dream thoughts, which I\ndefiantly hold up to my critics: \u201cEven though you are unwilling to\nbelieve it, because I take my time, I shall reach a conclusion (German\n_Schluss_, meaning either end or conclusion, _inference_). It has often\nhappened that way.\u201d\nIn its introductory portion this dream contains several sentences which\ncannot well be denied the character of an argumentation. And this\nargumentation is not at all absurd; it might just as well belong to\nwaking thought. _In the dream I make sport of the communication of the\nCommon Council, for in the first place I was not yet in the world in\n1851, and in the second place, my father, to whom it might refer, is\nalready dead._ Both are not only correct in themselves, but coincide\ncompletely with the arguments that I should use in case I should receive\na communication of the sort mentioned. We know from our previous\nanalysis that this dream has sprung from deeply embittered and scornful\ndream thoughts; if we may assume further that the motive for censorship\nis a very strong one, we shall understand that the dream activity has\nevery reason to create _a flawless refutation of a baseless insinuation_\naccording to the model contained in the dream thoughts. But analysis\nshows that in this case the dream activity has not had the task of\nmaking a free copy, but it has been required to use subject-matter from\nthe dream thoughts for its purpose. It is as if in an algebraic equation\nthere occurred plus and minus signs, signs of powers and of roots,\nbesides the figures, and as if someone, in copying this equation without\nunderstanding it, should take over into his copy the signs of operation\nas well as the figures, and fail to distinguish between the two kinds.\nThe two arguments may be traced to the following material. It is painful\nfor me to think that many of the assumptions upon which I base my\nsolution of psychoneuroses, as soon as they have become known, will\narouse scepticism and ridicule. Thus I must maintain that impressions\nfrom the second year of life, or even from the first, leave a lasting\ntrace upon the temperament of persons who later become diseased, and\nthat these impressions\u2014greatly distorted it is true, and exaggerated by\nmemory\u2014are capable of furnishing the original and fundamental basis of\nhysterical symptoms. Patients to whom I explain this in its proper place\nare in the habit of making a parody upon the explanation by declaring\nthemselves willing to look for reminiscences of the period _when they\nwere not yet alive_. It would quite accord with my expectation, if\nenlightenment on the subject of the unsuspected part played by the\nfather in the earliest sexual impulses of feminine patients should get a\nsimilar reception. (_Cf._ the discussion on p. 218.) And, nevertheless,\nboth positions are correct according to my well-founded conviction. In\nconfirmation I recall certain examples in which the death of the father\nhappened when the child was very young, and later events, otherwise\ninexplicable, proved that the child had unconsciously preserved\nrecollections of the persons who had so early gone out of its life. I\nknow that both of my assertions are based upon _inferences_ the validity\nof which will be attacked. If the subject-matter of these very\ninferences which I fear will be contested is used by the dream activity\nfor setting up _incontestable inferences_, this is a performance of the\nwish-fulfilment.\nVII. In a dream which I have hitherto only touched upon, astonishment at\nthe subject to be broached is distinctly expressed at the outset.\n\u201c_The elder Bruecke must have given me some task or other; strangely\nenough it relates to the preparation of my own lower body, pelvis and\nlegs, which I see before me as though in the dissecting room, but\nwithout feeling my lack of body and without a trace of horror. Louise N.\nis standing near, and doing her work next to me. The pelvis is\neviscerated; now the upper, now the lower view of the same is seen, and\nthe two views mingle. Thick fleshy red lumps (which even in the dream\nmake me think of h\u00e6morrhoids) are to be seen. Also something had to be\ncarefully picked out, which lay over these and which looked like\ncrumpled tinfoil.[FA] Then I was again in possession of my legs and made\na journey through the city, but took a wagon (owing to my fatigue). To\nmy astonishment the wagon drove into a house door, which opened and\nallowed it to pass into a passage that was snapped off at the end, and\nfinally led further on into the open.[FB] At last I wandered through\nchanging landscapes with an Alpine guide, who carried my things. He\ncarried, me for some way, out of consideration for my tired legs. The\nground was muddy, and we went along the edge; people sat on the ground,\na girl among them, like Indians or Gypsies. Previously I had moved\nmyself along on the slippery ground, with constant astonishment that I\nwas so well able to do it after the preparation. At last we came to a\nsmall wooden house which ended in an open window. Here the guide set me\ndown, and laid two wooden boards which stood in readiness on the window\nsill, in order that in this way the chasm might be bridged which had to\nbe crossed in order to get to the window. Now, I grew really frightened\nabout my legs. Instead of the expected crossing, I saw two grown-up men\nlying upon wooden benches which were on the walls of the hut, and\nsomething like two sleeping children next to them. It seems as though\nnot the boards but the children were intended to make possible the\ncrossing. I awakened with frightened thoughts._\u201d\nAnyone who has formed a proper idea of the abundance of dream\ncondensation will easily be able to imagine how great a number of pages\nthe detailed analysis of this dream must fill. Luckily for the context,\nI shall take from it merely the one example of astonishment, in the\ndream, which makes its appearance in the parenthetical remark,\n\u201c_strangely enough_.\u201d Let us take up the occasion of the dream. It is a\nvisit of this lady, Louise N., who assists at the work in the dream. She\nsays: \u201cLend me something to read.\u201d I offer her _She_, by Rider Haggard.\n\u201cA _strange_ book, but full of hidden sense,\u201d I try to explain to her;\n\u201cthe eternal feminine, the immortality of our emotions\u2014\u2014\u201d Here she\ninterrupts me: \u201cI know that book already. Haven\u2019t you something of your\nown?\u201d \u201cNo, my own immortal works are still unwritten.\u201d \u201cWell, when are\nyou going to publish your so-called latest revelations which you\npromised us would be good reading?\u201d she asks somewhat sarcastically. I\nnow perceive that she is a mouthpiece for someone else, and I become\nsilent. I think of the effort it costs me to publish even my work on the\nDream, in which I have to surrender so much of my own intimate\ncharacter. \u201cThe best that you know you can\u2019t tell to the children.\u201d The\npreparation of _my own body_, which I am ordered to make in the dream,\nis thus the _self-analysis_ necessitated in the communication of my\ndreams. The elder Bruecke very properly finds a place here; in these\nfirst years of my scientific work it happened that I neglected a\ndiscovery, until his energetic commands forced me to publish it. But the\nother trains of thought which start from my conversation with Louise N.\ngo too deep to become conscious; they are side-tracked by way of the\nrelated material which has been awakened in me by the mention of Rider\nHaggard\u2019s _She_. The comment \u201cstrangely enough\u201d goes with this book, and\nwith another by the same author, _The Heart of the World_, and numerous\nelements of the dream are taken from these two fantastic novels. The\nmuddy ground over which the dreamer is carried, the chasm which must be\ncrossed by means of the boards that have been brought along, come from\n_She_; the Indians, the girl, and the wooden house, from the _Heart of\nthe World_. In both novels a woman is the leader, both treat of\ndangerous wanderings; _She_ has to do with an adventurous journey to the\nundiscovered country, a place almost untrodden by foot of man. According\nto a note which I find in my record of the dream, the fatigue in my legs\nwas a real sensation of those days. Doubtless in correspondence with\nthis came a tired frame of mind and the doubting question: \u201cHow much\nfurther will my legs carry me?\u201d The adventure in _She_ ends with the\nwoman leader\u2019s meeting her death in the mysterious fire at the centre of\nthe earth, instead of attaining immortality for herself and others. A\nfear of this sort has unmistakably arisen in the dream thoughts. The\n\u201cwooden house,\u201d also, is surely the coffin\u2014that is, the grave. But the\ndream activity has performed its masterpiece in representing this most\nunwished-for of all thoughts by means of a wish-fulfilment. I have\nalready once been in a grave, but it was an empty Etruscan grave near\nOrvieto\u2014a narrow chamber with two stone benches on the walls, upon which\nthe skeletons of two grown-up persons had been laid. The interior of the\nwooden house in the dream looks exactly like this, except that wood has\nbeen substituted for stone. The dream seems to say: \u201cIf you must so soon\nlie in your grave, let it be this Etruscan grave,\u201d and by means of this\ninterpolation it transforms the saddest expectation into one that is\nreally to be desired. As we shall learn, it is, unfortunately, only the\nidea accompanying an emotion which the dream can change into its\nopposite, not usually the emotion itself. Thus I awake with \u201cfrightened\nthoughts,\u201d even after the dream has been forced to represent my\nidea\u2014that perhaps the children will attain what has been denied to the\nfather\u2014a fresh allusion to the strange novel in which the identity of a\nperson is preserved through a series of generations covering two\nthousand years.\nVIII. In the context of another dream there is a similar expression of\nastonishment at what is experienced in the dream. This, however, is\nconnected with a striking and skilfully contrived attempt at explanation\nwhich might well be called a stroke of genius\u2014so that I should have to\nanalyse the whole dream merely for the sake of it, even if the dream did\nnot possess two other features of interest. I am travelling during the\nnight between the eighteenth and the nineteenth of July on the Southern\nRailway, and in my sleep I hear someone call out: _\u201cHollthurn, 10\nminutes.\u201d I immediately think of Holothurian\u2014of a museum of natural\nhistory\u2014that here is a place where brave men have vainly resisted the\ndomination of their overlord. Yes, the counter reformation in Austria!\nAs though it were a place in Styria or the Tyrol. Now I distinctly see a\nlittle museum in which the remains or the possessions of these men are\npreserved. I wish to get off, but I hesitate to do so. Women with fruit\nare standing on the platform; they crouch on the floor, and in that\nposition hold out their baskets in an inviting manner. I hesitate, in\ndoubt whether we still have time, but we are still standing. I am\nsuddenly in another compartment in which the leather and the seats are\nso narrow that one\u2019s back directly touches the back rest.[FC] I am\nsurprised at this, but I may have changed cars while asleep. Several\npeople, among them an English brother and sister; a row of books\ndistinctly on a shelf on the wall. I see_ The Wealth of Nations, _then_\nMatter and Motion (_by Maxwell_)\u2014_the books are thick and bound in brown\nlinen. The man asks his sister for a book by Schiller, and whether she\nhas forgotten it. These are books which first seem mine, then seem to\nbelong to the brother and sister. At this point I wish to join in the\nconversation in order to confirm and support what is being said\u2014\u2014._ I\nawaken sweating all over my body, because all the windows are shut. The\ntrain stops at Marburg.\nWhile writing down the dream, a part of it occurs to me which my memory\nwished to omit. _I say to the brother and sister about a certain work:\n\u201cIt is from ...\u201d but I correct myself: \u201cIt is by ...\u201d The man remarks to\nhis sister: \u201cHe said it correctly.\u201d_\nThe dream begins with the name of a station, which probably must have\npartially awakened me. For this name, which was Marburg, I substituted\nHollthurn. The fact that I heard Marburg when it was first called, or\nperhaps when it was called a second time, is proved by the mention in\nthe dream of Schiller, who was born in Marburg, though not in the one in\nStyria.[FD] Now this time, although I was travelling first-class, it was\nunder very disagreeable circumstances. The train was overcrowded; I had\nmet a gentleman and lady in my compartment who seemed persons of\nquality, but who did not have the good breeding or who did not think it\nworth while to conceal their displeasure at my intrusion. My polite\nsalutation was not answered, and although the man and the woman sat next\neach other (with their backs in the direction in which we were riding),\nthe woman made haste to pre-empt the place opposite her and next the\nwindow with her umbrella; the door was immediately closed and\ndemonstrative remarks about the opening of windows were exchanged.\nProbably I was quickly recognised as a person hungry for fresh air. It\nwas a hot night, and the air in the compartment, thus shut on all sides,\nwas almost suffocating. My experience as a traveller leads me to believe\nthat such inconsiderate, obtrusive conduct marks people who have only\npartly paid for their tickets, or not at all. When the conductor came,\nand I presented my dearly bought ticket, the lady called out\nungraciously, and as though threateningly: \u201cMy husband has a pass.\u201d She\nwas a stately figure with sour features, in age not far from the time\nset for the decay of feminine beauty; the man did not get a chance to\nsay anything at all, and sat there motionless. I tried to sleep. In the\ndream I take terrible revenge on my disagreeable travelling companions;\nno one would suspect what insults and humiliations are concealed behind\nthe disjointed fragments of the first half of the dream. After this\ndesire has been satisfied, the second wish, to exchange my compartment\nfor another, makes itself evident. The dream makes changes of scene so\noften, and without raising the least objection to such changes, that it\nwould not have been in the least remarkable if I had immediately\nreplaced my travelling companions by more pleasant ones for my\nrecollection. But this was one of the cases where something or other\nobjected to the change of scene and considered explanation of the change\nnecessary. How did I suddenly get into another compartment? I surely\ncould not remember having changed cars. So there was only one\nexplanation: _I must have left the carriage while asleep_, a rare\noccurrence, examples for which, however, are furnished by the experience\nof the neuropathologist. We know of persons who undertake railroad\njourneys in a crepuscular state without betraying their abnormal\ncondition by any sign, until some station on the journey they completely\nrecover consciousness, and are then surprised at the gap in their\nmemory. Thus, while I am still dreaming, I declare my own case to be\nsuch a one of \u201c_Automatisme ambulatoire_.\u201d\nAnalysis permits another solution. The attempt at explanation, which so\nastounds me if I am to attribute it to the dream activity, is not\noriginal, but is copied from the neurosis of one of my patients. I have\nalready spoken on another page of a highly cultured and, in conduct,\nkind-hearted man, who began, shortly after the death of his parents, to\naccuse himself of murderous inclinations, and who suffered because of\nthe precautionary measures he had to take to insure himself against\nthese inclinations. At first walking along the street was made painful\nfor him by the compulsion impelling him to demand an accounting of all\nthe persons he met as to whither they had vanished; if one of them\nsuddenly withdrew from his pursuing glance, there remained a painful\nfeeling and a thought of the possibility that he might have put the man\nout of the way. This compulsive idea concealed, among other things, a\nCain-fancy, for \u201call men are brothers.\u201d Owing to the impossibility of\naccomplishing his task, he gave up taking walks and spent his life\nimprisoned within his four walls. But news of murderous acts which have\nbeen committed outside constantly reached his room through the papers,\nand his conscience in the form of a doubt kept accusing him of being the\nmurderer. The certainty of not having left his dwelling for weeks\nprotected him against these accusations for a time, until one day there\ndawned upon him the possibility that he might have left _his house while\nin an unconscious condition_, and might thus have committed the murder\nwithout knowing anything about it. From that time on he locked his house\ndoor, and handed the key over to his old housekeeper, and strictly\nforbade her to give it into his hands even if he demanded it.\nThis, then, is the origin of the attempted explanation, that I may have\nchanged carriages while in an unconscious condition\u2014it has been\ntransferred from the material of the dream thoughts to the dream in a\nfinished state, and is obviously intended to identify me with the person\nof that patient. My memory of him was awakened by an easy association. I\nhad made my last night journey with this man a few weeks before. He was\ncured, and was escorting me into the country, to his relatives who were\nsummoning me; as we had a compartment to ourselves, we left all the\nwindows open through the night, and, as long as I had remained awake, we\nhad a delightful conversation. I knew that hostile impulses towards his\nfather from the time of his childhood, in connection with sexual\nmaterial, had been at the root of his illness. By identifying myself\nwith him, I wanted to make an analogous confession to myself. The second\nscene of the dream really resolves itself into a wanton fancy to the\neffect that my two elderly travelling companions had acted so uncivilly\ntowards me for the reason that my arrival prevented them from exchanging\nlove-tokens during the night as they had intended. This fancy, however,\ngoes back to an early childhood scene in which, probably impelled by\nsexual inquisitiveness, I intruded upon the bedroom of my parents, and\nwas driven from it by my father\u2019s emphatic command.\nI consider it superfluous to multiply further examples. All of them\nwould confirm what we have learned from those which have been already\ncited, namely, that an act of judgment in the dream is nothing but the\nrepetition of a prototype which it has in the dream thoughts. In most\ncases it is an inappropriate repetition introduced in an unfitting\nconnection; occasionally, however, as in our last example, it is so\nartfully disposed that it may give the impression of being an\nindependent thought activity in the dream. At this point we might turn\nour attention to that psychic activity which indeed does not seem to\nco-operate regularly in the formation of dreams, but whose effort it is,\nwherever it does co-operate, to fuse together those dream elements that\nare incongruent on account of their origins in an uncontradictory and\nintelligible manner. We consider it best, however, first to take up the\nexpressions of emotion which appear in the dream, and to compare them\nwith the emotions which analysis reveals to us in the dream thoughts.\n(_g_) _The Affects in the Dream._\nA profound remark of Stricker\u2019s[77] has called our attention to the fact\nthat the expressions of emotion in the dream do not permit of being\ndisposed of in the slighting manner in which we are accustomed to shake\noff the dream itself, after we have awakened. \u201cIf I am afraid of robbers\nin the dream, the robbers, to be sure, are imaginary, but the fear of\nthem is real,\u201d and the same is true if I am glad in the dream. According\nto the testimony of our feelings, the emotion experienced in the dream\nis in no way less valid than one of like intensity experienced in waking\nlife, and the dream makes its claim to be taken up as a part of our real\nmental experiences, more energetically on account of its emotional\ncontent than on account of its ideal content. We do not succeed in\naccomplishing this separation in waking life, because we do not know how\nto estimate an emotion psychically except in connection with a\npresentation content. If in kind or in intensity an affect and an idea\nare incongruous, our waking judgment becomes confused.\nThe fact that in dreams the presentation content does not entail the\naffective influence which we should expect as necessary in waking\nthought has always caused astonishment. Str\u00fcmpell was of the opinion\nthat ideas in the dream are stripped of their psychic values. But\nneither does the dream lack opposite instances, where the expression of\nintense affect appears in a content, which seems to offer no occasion\nfor its development. I am in a horrible, dangerous, or disgusting\nsituation in the dream, but I feel nothing of fear or aversion; on the\nother hand, I am sometimes terrified at harmless things and glad at\nchildish ones.\nThis enigma of the dream disappears more suddenly and more completely\nthan perhaps any other of the dream problems, if we pass from the\nmanifest to the latent content. We shall then no longer be concerned to\nexplain it, for it will no longer exist. Analysis teaches us _that\npresentation contents have undergone displacements and substitutions,\nwhile affects have remained unchanged_. No wonder, then, that the\npresentation content which has been altered by dream disfigurement no\nlonger fits the affect that has remained intact; but there is no cause\nfor wonder either after analysis has put the correct content in its\nformer place.\nIn a psychic complex which has been subjected to the influence of the\nresisting censor the affects are the unyielding constituent, which alone\nis capable of guiding us to a correct supplementation. This state of\naffairs is revealed in psychoneuroses even more distinctly than in the\ndream. Here the affect is always in the right, at least as far as its\nquality goes; its intensity may even be increased by means of a\ndisplacement of neurotic attention. If a hysteric is surprised that he\nis so very afraid of a trifle, or if the patient with compulsive ideas\nis astonished that he develops such painful self-reproach out of a\nnonentity, both of them err in that they regard the presentation\ncontent\u2014the trifle or the nonentity\u2014as the essential thing, and they\ndefend themselves in vain because they make this presentation content\nthe starting point in their thought. Psychoanalysis, however, shows them\nthe right way by recognising that, on the contrary, the affect is\njustified, and by searching for the presentation which belongs to it and\nwhich has been suppressed by means of replacement. The assumption is\nhere made that the development of affect and the presentation content do\nnot constitute such an indissoluble organic union as we are accustomed\nto think, but that the two parts may be, so to speak, soldered together\nin such a way that they may be detached from one another by means of\nanalysis. Dream interpretation shows that this is actually the case.\nI give first an example in which analysis explains the apparent absence\nof affect in a presentation content which ought to force a development\nof emotion.\nI. _The dreamer sees three lions in a desert, one of which is laughing,\nbut she is not afraid of them. Then, however, she must have fled from\nthem, for she is trying to climb a tree, but she finds that her cousin,\nwho is a teacher of French, is already up in the tree, &c._\nThe analysis gives us the following material for this dream: A sentence\nin the dreamer\u2019s English lesson had become the indifferent occasion for\nit: \u201cThe _lion\u2019s_ greatest beauty is his mane.\u201d Her father wore a beard\nwhich surrounded his face like a mane. The name of her English teacher\nwas Miss _Lyons_. An acquaintance of hers had sent her the ballads of\n_Loewe_ (German, Loewe\u2014lion). These, then, are the three lions; why\nshould she have been afraid of them? She has read a story in which a\nnegro who has incited his fellows to revolt is hunted with bloodhounds\nand climbs a tree to save himself. Then follow fragments in wanton mood,\nlike the following. Directions for catching lions from _Die Fliegende\nBlaetter_: \u201cTake a desert and strain it; the lions will remain.\u201d Also a\nvery amusing, but not very proper anecdote about an official who is\nasked why he does not take greater pains to win the favour of his\nsuperior officer, and who answers that he has been trying to insinuate\nhimself, but that the man ahead of him _is already up_. The whole matter\nbecomes intelligible as soon as one learns that on the day of the dream\nthe lady had received a visit from her husband\u2019s superior. He was very\npolite to her, kissed her hand, and _she was not afraid of him at all_,\nalthough he is a \u201cbig bug\u201d (German\u2014_Grosses Tier_ = \u201cbig animal\u201d) and\nplays the part of a \u201csocial lion\u201d in the capital of her country. This\nlion is, therefore, like the lion in the _Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream_, who\nunmasks as Snug, the joiner, and of such stuff are all dream lions made\nwhen one is not afraid.\nII. As my second example, I cite the dream of the girl who saw her\nsister\u2019s little son lying dead in a coffin, but who, I may now add, felt\nno pain or sorrow thereat. We know from analysis why not. The dream only\nconcealed her wish to see the man she loved again; the affect must be\nattuned to the wish, and not to its concealment. There was no occasion\nfor sorrow at all.\nIn a number of dreams the emotion at least remains connected with that\npresentation content which has replaced the one really belonging to it.\nIn others the breaking up of the complex is carried further. The affect\nseems to be entirely separated from the idea belonging to it, and finds\na place somewhere else in the dream where it fits into the new\narrangement of the dream elements. This is similar to what we have\nlearned of acts of judgment of the dream. If there is a significant\ninference in the dream thoughts, the dream also contains one; but in the\ndream the inference may be shifted to entirely different material. Not\ninfrequently this shifting takes place according to the principle of\nantithesis.\nI illustrate the latter possibility by the following dream, which I have\nsubjected to the most exhaustive analysis.\nIII. _A castle by the sea; afterwards it lies not directly on the sea,\nbut on a narrow canal that leads to the sea. A certain Mr. P. is the\ngovernor of it. I stand with him in a large salon with three windows, in\nfront of which rise the projections of a wall, like battlements of a\nfort. I belong to the garrison, perhaps as a volunteer marine officer.\nWe fear the arrival of hostile warships, for we are in a state of war.\nMr. P. has the intention of leaving; he gives me instructions as to what\nmust be done in case the dreaded event happens. His sick wife is in the\nthreatened castle with her children. As soon as the bombardment begins\nthe large hall should be cleared. He breathes heavily, and tries to get\naway; I hold him back, and ask him in what way I should send him news in\ncase of need. He says something else, and then all at once falls over\ndead. I have probably taxed him unnecessarily with my questions. After\nhis death, which makes no further impression upon me, I think whether\nthe widow is to remain in the castle, whether I should give notice of\nthe death to the commander-in-chief, and whether I should take over the\ndirection of the castle as the next in command. I now stand at the\nwindow, and muster the ships as they pass by; they are merchantmen that\ndart past upon the dark water, several of them with more than one\nsmokestack, others with bulging decks_ (that are quite similar to the\nrailway stations in the preliminary dream which has not been told).\n_Then my brother stands next to me, and both of us look out of the\nwindow on to the canal. At the sight of a ship we are frightened, and\ncall out: \u201cHere comes the warship!\u201d It turns out, however, that it is\nonly the same ships which I have already known that are returning. Now\ncomes a little ship, strangely cut off, so that it ends in the middle of\nits breadth; curious things like cups or salt-cellars are seen on the\ndeck. We call as though with one voice: \u201cThat is the breakfast-ship.\u201d_\nThe rapid motion of the ships, the deep blue of the water, the brown\nsmoke of the funnels, all this together makes a highly tense, sombre\nimpression.\nThe localities in this dream are put together from several journeys to\nthe Adriatic Sea (Miramare, Duino, Venice, Aquileja). A short but\nenjoyable Easter trip to Aquileja with my brother, a few weeks before\nthe dream, was still fresh in my memory. Besides, the naval war between\nAmerica and Spain, and the worry connected with it about my relatives\nliving in America, play a part. Manifestations of emotion appear at two\nplaces in this dream. In one place an emotion that would be expected is\nlacking\u2014it is expressly emphasized that the death of the governor makes\nno impression upon me; at another point, where I see the warships I am\n_frightened_, and experience all the sensations of fright while I sleep.\nThe distribution of affects in this well-constructed dream has been made\nin such a way that every obvious contradiction is avoided. For there is\nno reason why I should be frightened at the governor\u2019s death, and it is\nfitting that as the commander of the castle I should be alarmed by the\nsight of the warship. Now analysis shows that Mr. P. is nothing but a\nsubstitute for my own Ego (in the dream I am his substitute). I am the\ngovernor who suddenly dies. The dream thoughts deal with the future of\nthose dear to me after my premature death. No other disagreeable thought\nis to be found among the dream thoughts. The fright which is attached to\nthe sight of the warship must be transferred from it to this\ndisagreeable thought. Inversely, the analysis shows that the region of\nthe dream thoughts from which the warship comes is filled with most\njoyous reminiscences. It was at Venice a year before, one charmingly\nbeautiful day, that we stood at the windows of our room on the Riva\nSchiavoni and looked upon the blue lagoon, in which more activity could\nbe seen that day than usually. English ships were being expected, they\nwere to be festively received; and suddenly my wife called out, happy as\na child: \u201c_There come the English warships!_\u201d In the dream I am\nfrightened at the very same words; we see again that speeches in the\ndream originate from speeches in life. I shall soon show that even the\nelement \u201cEnglish\u201d in this speech has not been lost for the dream\nactivity. I thus convert joy into fright on the way from the dream\nthoughts to the dream content, and I need only intimate that by means of\nthis very transformation I give expression to a part of the latent dream\ncontent. The example shows, however, that the dream activity is at\nliberty to detach the occasion for an affect from its context in the\ndream thoughts, and to insert it at any other place it chooses in the\ndream content.\nI seize the opportunity which is incidentally offered, of subjecting to\ncloser analysis the \u201cbreakfast ship,\u201d whose appearance in the dream so\nnonsensically concludes a situation that has been rationally adhered to.\nIf I take a closer view of this object in the dream, I am now struck by\nthe fact that it was black, and that on account of its being cut off at\nits greatest breadth it closely resembled, at the end where it was cut\noff, an object which had aroused our interest in the museums of the\nEtruscan cities. This object was a rectangular cup of black clay with\ntwo handles, upon which stood things like coffee cups, or tea cups, very\nsimilar to our modern _breakfast_ table service. Upon inquiring, we\nlearned that this was the toilet set of an Etruscan lady, with little\nboxes for rouge and powder; and we said jokingly to each other that it\nwould not be a bad idea to take a thing like that home to the lady of\nthe house. The dream object, therefore, signifies \u201c_black toilet_\u201d\n(German, _toilette_\u2014dress)\u2014mourning\u2014and has direct reference to a death.\nThe other end of the dream object reminds us of the \u201cboat\u201d (German,\n_Nachen_), from the root \u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03c5\u03c2, as a philological friend has told me,\nupon which corpses were laid in prehistoric times and were left to be\nburied by the sea. With this circumstance is connected the reason for\nthe return of the ships in the dream.\n\u201cQuietly the old man on his rescued boat drifts into the harbour.\u201d\nIt is the return voyage after the ship_wreck_ (German, schiff_bruch_;\nship-_breaking_, _i.e._ shipwreck), the breakfast-ship looks as though\nit were _broken_ off in the middle. But whence comes the name\n\u201cbreakfast\u201d-ship? Here is where the \u201cEnglish\u201d comes in, which we have\nleft over from the warships. _Breakfast\u2014a breaking of the fast._\nBreaking again belongs to ship-_wreck_ (Schiff_bruch_), and _fasting_ is\nconnected with the mourning dress.\nThe only thing about this breakfast-ship, which has been newly created\nby the dream, is its name. The thing has existed in reality, and recalls\nto me the merriest hours of my last journey. As we distrusted the fare\nin Aquileja, we took some food with us from Goerz, and bought a bottle\nof excellent Istrian wine in Aquileja, and while the little mail-steamer\nslowly travelled through the Canal delle Mee and into the lonely stretch\nof lagoon towards Grado, we took our breakfast on deck\u2014we were the only\npassengers\u2014and it tasted to us as few breakfasts have ever tasted. This,\nthen, was the \u201c_breakfast-ship_,\u201d and it is behind this very\nrecollection of great enjoyment that the dream hides the saddest\nthoughts about an unknown and ominous future.\nThe detachment of emotions from the groups of ideas which have been\nresponsible for their development is the most striking thing that\nhappens to them in the course of dream formation, but it is neither the\nonly nor even the most essential change which they undergo on the way\nfrom the dream thoughts to the manifest dream. If the affects in the\ndream thoughts are compared with those in the dream, it at once becomes\nclear that wherever there is an emotion in the dream, this is also to be\nfound in the dream thoughts; the converse, however, is not true. In\ngeneral, the dream is less rich in affects than the psychic material\nfrom which it is elaborated. As soon as I have reconstructed the dream\nthoughts I see that the most intense psychic impulses are regularly\nstriving in them for self-assertion, usually in conflict with others\nthat are sharply opposed to them. If I turn back to the dream, I often\nfind it colourless and without any of the more intense strains of\nfeeling. Not only the content, but also the affective tone of my\nthoughts has been brought by the dream activity to the level of the\nindifferent. I might say that a _suppression of the affects_ has taken\nplace. Take, for example, the dream of the botanical monograph. It\nanswers to a passionate plea for my freedom to act as I am acting and to\narrange my life as seems right to me and to me alone. The dream which\nresults from it sounds indifferent; I have written a monograph; it is\nlying before me; it is fitted with coloured plates, and dried plants are\nto be found with each copy. It is like the peacefulness of a\nbattlefield; there is no trace left of the tumult of battle.\nIt may also turn out differently\u2014vivid affective expressions may make\ntheir appearance in the dream; but we shall first dwell upon the\nunquestionable fact that many dreams appear indifferent, while it is\nnever possible to go deeply into the dream thoughts without deep\nemotion.\nA complete theoretical explanation of this suppression of emotions in\nthe course of the dream activity cannot be given here; it would require\na most careful investigation of the theory of the emotions and of the\nmechanism of suppression. I shall find a place here for two thoughts\nonly. I am forced\u2014on other grounds\u2014to conceive the development of\naffects as a centrifugal process directed towards the interior of the\nbody, analogous to the processes of motor and secretory innervation.\nJust as in the sleeping condition the omission of motor impulses towards\nthe outside world seems to be suspended, so a centrifugal excitement of\nemotions through unconscious thought may be made more difficult during\nsleep. Thus the affective impulses aroused during the discharge of the\ndream thoughts would themselves be weak excitements, and therefore those\ngetting into the dream would not be stronger. According to this line of\nargument the \u201csuppression of the affects\u201d would not be a result of the\ndream activity at all, but a result of the sleeping condition. This may\nbe so, but this cannot possibly be all. We must also remember that all\nthe more complex dreams have shown themselves to be a compromised result\nfrom the conflict of psychic forces. On the one hand, the thoughts that\nconstitute the wish must fight the opposition of a censorship; on the\nother hand, we have often seen how, even in unconscious thinking, each\ntrain of thought is harnessed to its contradictory opposite. Since all\nof these trains of thought are capable of emotion, we shall hardly make\na mistake, broadly speaking, if we regard the suppression of emotion as\nthe result of the restraint which the contrasts impose upon one another\nand which the censor imposes upon the tendencies which it has\nsuppressed. _The restraint of affects would accordingly he the second\nresult of the dream censor as the disfigurement of the dream was the\nfirst._\nI shall insert an example of a dream in which the indifferent affective\ntone of the dream content may be explained by a contrast in the dream\nthoughts. I have the following short dream to relate, which every reader\nwill read with disgust:\nIV. _A bit of rising ground, and on it something like a toilet in the\nopen; a very long bench, at the end of which is a large toilet aperture.\nAll of the back edge is thickly covered with little heaps of excrement\nof all sizes and degrees of freshness. A shrub behind the bench. I\nurinate upon the bench; a long stream of urine rinses everything clean,\nthe patches of excrement easily come off and fall into the opening. It\nseems as though something remained at the end nevertheless._\nWhy did I experience no disgust in this dream?\nBecause, as the analysis shows, the most pleasant and satisfying\nthoughts have co-operated in the formation of this dream. Upon analysing\nit I immediately think of the Augean stables cleansed by Hercules. I am\nthis Hercules. The rising ground and the shrub belong to Aussee, where\nmy children are now staying. I have discovered the infantile etiology of\nthe neuroses and have thus guarded my own children from becoming ill.\nThe bench (omitting the aperture, of course) is the faithful copy of a\npiece of furniture which an affectionate female patient has made me a\npresent of. This recalls how my patients honour me. Even the museum of\nhuman excrement is susceptible of less disagreeable interpretation.\nHowever much I am disgusted with it, it is a souvenir of the beautiful\nland of Italy, where in little cities, as everyone knows, water-closets\nare not equipped in any other way. The stream of urine that washes\neverything clean is an unmistakable allusion to greatness. It is in this\nmanner that Gulliver extinguishes the great fire in Lilliput; to be\nsure, he thereby incurs the displeasure of the tiniest of queens. In\nthis way, too, Gargantua, the superman in Master Rabelais, takes\nvengeance upon the Parisians, straddling Notre Dame and training his\nstream of urine upon the city. Only yesterday I was turning over the\nleaves of Garnier\u2019s illustrations of Rabelais before I went to bed. And,\nstrangely enough, this is another proof that I am the superman! The\nplatform of Notre Dame was my favourite nook in Paris; every free\nafternoon I was accustomed to go up into the towers of the church and\nclimb about among the monsters and devil-masks there. The circumstances\nthat all the excrement vanishes so rapidly before the stream correspond\nto the motto: _Afflavit et dissipati sunt_, which I shall some day make\nthe title of a chapter on the therapeutics of hysteria.\nAnd now as to the occasion giving rise to the dream. It had been a hot\nafternoon in summer; in the evening I had given a lecture on the\nrelation between hysteria and the perversions, and everything which I\nhad to say displeased me thoroughly, appeared to me stripped of all\nvalue. I was tired, found no trace of pleasure in my difficult task, and\nlonged to get away from this rummaging in human filth, to see my\nchildren and then the beauties of Italy. In this mood I went from the\nauditorium to a caf\u00e9, to find some modest refreshment in the open air,\nfor my appetite had left me. But one of my audience went with me; he\nbegged for permission to sit with me while I drank my coffee and gulped\ndown my roll, and began to say flattering things to me. He told me how\nmuch he had learned from me, and that he now looked at everything\nthrough different eyes, that I had cleansed the Augean stables, _i.e._\nthe theory of the neuroses, of its errors and prejudices\u2014in short, that\nI was a very great man. My mood was ill-suited to his song of praise; I\nstruggled with disgust, and went home earlier in order to extricate\nmyself. Before I went to sleep I turned over the leaves of Rabelais, and\nread a short story by C. F. Meyer entitled _Die Leiden eines Knaben_\n(The Hardships of a Boy).\nThe dream had been drawn from these materials, and the novel by Meyer\nadded the recollection of childish scenes (_cf._ the dream about Count\nThun, last scene). The mood of the day, characterised by disgust and\nannoyance, is continued in the dream in the sense that it is permitted\nto furnish nearly the entire material for the dream content. But during\nthe night the opposite mood of vigorous and even exaggerated\nself-assertion was awakened, and dissipated the earlier mood. The dream\nhad to take such a form as to accommodate the expression of\nself-depreciation and exaggerated self-assertion in the same material.\nThis compromise formation resulted in an ambiguous dream content, but\nlikewise in an indifferent strain of feeling owing to the restraint of\nthe contrasts upon each other.\nAccording to the theory of wish-fulfilment this dream could not have\nhappened had not the suppressed, but at the same time pleasurable, train\nof thought concerning personal aggrandisement been coupled with the\nopposing thoughts of disgust. For disagreeable things are not intended\nto be represented by the dream; painful thoughts that have occurred\nduring the day can force their way into the dream only if they lend a\ncloak to the wish-fulfilment. The dream activity can dispose of the\naffects in the dream thoughts in still another way, besides admitting\nthem or reducing them to zero. _It can change them into their opposite._\nWe have already become acquainted with the rule of interpretation that\nevery element of the dream may be interpreted by its opposite, as well\nas by itself. One can never tell at the outset whether to set down the\none or the other; only the connection can decide this point. A suspicion\nof this state of affairs has evidently got into popular consciousness;\ndream books very often proceed according to the principle of contraries\nin their interpretation. Such transformation into opposites is made\npossible by the intimate concatenation of associations, which in our\nthoughts finds the idea of a thing in that of its opposite. Like every\nother displacement this serves the purposes of the censor, but it is\nalso often the work of the wish-fulfilment, for wish-fulfilment consists\nprecisely in this substitution of an unwelcome thing by its opposite.\nThe emotions of the dream thoughts may appear in the dream transformed\ninto their opposites just as well as the ideas, and it is probable that\nthis inversion of emotions is usually brought about by the dream censor.\nThe _suppression_ and _inversion of affects_ are useful in social life,\nas the current analogy for the dream censor has shown us\u2014above all, for\npurposes of dissimulation. If I converse with a person to whom I must\nshow consideration while I am saying unpleasant things to him, it is\nalmost more important that I should conceal the expression of my emotion\nfrom him, than that I modify the wording of my thoughts. If I speak to\nhim in polite words, but accompany them by looks or gestures of hatred\nand disdain, the effect which I produce upon this person is not very\ndifferent from what it would have been if I had recklessly thrown my\ncontempt into his face. Above all, then, the censor bids me suppress my\nemotions, and if I am master of the art of dissimulation, I can\nhypocritically show the opposite emotion\u2014smiling where I should like to\nbe angry, and pretending affection where I should like to destroy.\nWe already know of an excellent example of such an inversion of emotion\nfor the purposes of the dream censor. In the dream about my uncle\u2019s\nbeard I feel great affection for my friend R., at the same time that,\nand because, the dream thoughts berate him as a simpleton. We have drawn\nour first proof for the existence of the censor from this example of the\ninversion of emotions. Nor is it necessary here to assume that the dream\nactivity creates a counter emotion of this kind out of nothing; it\nusually finds it lying ready in the material of the dream thoughts, and\nintensifies it solely with the psychic force of the resisting impulse\nuntil a point is reached where the emotion can be won over for the\nformation of the dream. In the dream of my uncle, just mentioned, the\naffectionate counter emotion has probably originated from an infantile\nsource (as the continuation of the dream would suggest), for the\nrelation between uncle and nephew has become the source of all my\nfriendships and hatreds, owing to the peculiar nature of my childish\nexperiences (_cf._ analysis on p. 334).\nThere is a class of dreams deserving the designation \u201chypocritical,\u201d\nwhich puts the theory of wish-fulfilment to a severe test. My attention\nwas called to them when Mrs. Dr. M. Hilferding brought up for discussion\nin the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society the dream reported by Rosegger,\nwhich is reprinted below.\nIn _Waldheimat_, vol. xi., Rosegger writes as follows in his story,\n_Fremd gemacht_, p. 303:\n\u201cI have usually enjoyed healthful sleep, but I have lost the rest of\nmany a night. With my modest existence as a student and literary man,\nI have for long years dragged along with me the shadow of a veritable\ntailor\u2019s life, like a ghost from which I could not become separated. I\ncannot say that I have occupied myself so often and so vividly with\nthoughts of my past during the day. An assailer of heaven and earth\narising from the skin of the Philistine has other things to think\nabout. Nor did I, as a dashing young fellow, think about my nocturnal\ndreams; only later, when I got into the habit of thinking about\neverything or when the Philistine within me again asserted itself, it\nstruck me that whenever I dreamed I was always the journeyman tailor,\nand was always working in my master\u2019s shop for long hours without any\nremuneration. As I sat there and sewed and pressed I was quite aware\nthat I no longer belonged there, and that as a burgess of a town I had\nother things to attend to; but I was for ever having vacations, and\ngoing out into the country, and it was then that I sat near my boss\nand assisted him. I often felt badly, and regretted the loss of time\nwhich I might spend for better and more useful purposes. If something\ndid not come up to the measure and cut exactly, I had to submit to a\nreproach from the boss. Often, as I sat with my back bent in the dingy\nshop, I decided to give notice that I was going to quit. On one\noccasion I actually did so, but the boss took no notice of it, and the\nnext time I was again sitting near him and sewing.\n\u201cHow happy I was when I woke up after such weary hours! And I then\nresolved that, if this dream came intruding again, I would throw it\noff with energy and would cry aloud: \u2018It is only a delusion, I am in\nbed, and I want to sleep.\u2019... And the next night I would be sitting in\nthe tailor shop again.\n\u201cThus years passed with dismal regularity. While the boss and I were\nworking at Alpelhofer\u2019s, at the house of the peasant where I began my\napprenticeship, it happened that he was particularly dissatisfied with\nmy work. \u2018I should like to know where in the world your thoughts are?\u2019\ncried he, and looked at me gloomily, I thought the most sensible thing\nfor me to do would be to get up and explain to the boss that I was\nwith him only as a favour, and then leave. But I did not do this. I\nsubmitted, however, when the boss engaged an apprentice, and ordered\nme to make room for him on the bench. I moved into the corner, and\nkept on sewing. On the same day another tailor was engaged; he was\nbigoted, as he was a Czech who had worked for us nineteen years\nbefore, and then had fallen into the lake on his way home from the\npublic-house. When he tried to sit down there was no room for him. I\nlooked at the boss inquiringly, and he said to me, \u2018You have no talent\nfor the tailoring business; you may go; you are free.\u2019 My fright on\nthat occasion was so overpowering that I awoke.\n\u201cThe morning gray glimmered through the clear window of my beloved\nhome. Objects of art surrounded me; in the tasteful bookcase stood the\neternal Homer, the gigantic Dante, the incomparable Shakespeare, the\nglorious Goethe\u2014all shining and immortal. From the adjoining room\nresounded the clear little voices of the children, who were waking and\nprattling with their mother. I felt as if I had found again that\nidyllically sweet, that peaceful, poetical, and spiritual life which I\nhave so often and so deeply conceived as the contemplative fortune of\nmankind. And still I was vexed that I had not given my boss notice\nfirst, instead of allowing him to discharge me.\n\u201cAnd how remarkable it is; after the night when the boss \u2018discharged\nme\u2019 I enjoyed rest; I no longer dreamed of my tailoring\u2014of this\nexperience which lay in the remote past, which in its simplicity was\nreally happy, and which, nevertheless, threw a long shadow over the\nlater years of my life.\u201d\nI. In this dream, the series of the poet who, in his younger years, has\nbeen a journeyman tailor, it is hard to recognise the domination of the\nwish-fulfilment. All the delightful things occurred during the waking\nstate, while the dream seemed to drag along the ghostlike shadow of an\nunhappy existence which had been long forgotten. My own dreams of a\nsimilar nature have put me in a position to give some explanation for\nsuch dreams. As a young doctor I for a long time worked in the chemical\ninstitute without being able to accomplish anything in that exacting\nscience, and I therefore never think in my waking state about this\nunfruitful episode in my life, of which I am really ashamed. On the\nother hand, it has become a recurring dream with me that I am working in\nthe laboratory, making analyses, and having experiences there, &c.; like\nthe examination dreams, these dreams are disagreeable, and they are\nnever very distinct. During the analysis of one of these dreams my\nattention was directed to the word \u201canalysis,\u201d which, gave me the key to\nan understanding of these dreams. For I had since become an \u201canalyst.\u201d I\nmake analyses which are highly praised\u2014to be sure, psychoanalyses. I\nthen understood that when I grew proud of these analyses of the waking\nstate, and wanted to boast how much I had accomplished thereby, the\ndream would hold up to me at night those other unsuccessful analyses of\nwhich I had no reason to be proud; they are the punitive dreams of the\nupstart, like those of the tailor who became a celebrated poet. But how\nis it possible for the dream to place itself at the service of\nself-criticism in its conflict with parvenu-pride, and to take as its\ncontent a rational warning instead of the fulfilment of a prohibitive\nwish? I have already mentioned that the answer to this question entails\nmany difficulties. We may conclude that the foundation of the dream was\nat first formed by a phantasy of overweening ambition, but that only its\nsuppression and its abashment reached the dream content in its stead.\nOne should remember that there are masochistic tendencies in the psychic\nlife to which such an inversion might be attributed. But a more thorough\ninvestigation of the individual dreams allows the recognition of still\nanother element. In an indistinct subordinate portion of one of my\nlaboratory dreams, I was just at the age which placed me in the most\ngloomy and most unsuccessful year of my professional career; I still had\nno position and no means of support, when I suddenly found that I had\nthe choice of many women whom I could marry! I was, therefore, young\nagain, and, what is more, she was young again\u2014the woman who has shared\nwith me all these hard years. In this way one of the wishes which\nconstantly frets the heart of the ageing man was revealed as the\nunconscious dream inciter. The struggle raging in the other psychic\nstrata between vanity and self-criticism has certainly determined the\ndream content, but the more deeply-rooted wish of youth has alone made\nit possible as a dream. One may say to himself even in the waking state:\nTo be sure it is very nice now, and times were once very hard; but it\nwas nice, too, even then, you were still so young.\nIn considering dreams reported by a poet one may often assume that he\nhas excluded from the report those details which he perceived as\ndisturbing and which he considered unessential. His dreams, then, give\nus a riddle which could be readily solved if we had an exact\nreproduction of the dream content.\nO. Rank has called my attention to the fact that in Grimm\u2019s fairy tale\nof the valiant little tailor, or \u201cSeven at one Stroke,\u201d a very similar\ndream of an upstart is related. The tailor, who became the hero and\nmarried the king\u2019s daughter, dreamed one night while with the princess,\nhis wife, about his trade; the latter, becoming suspicious, ordered\narmed guards for the following night, who should listen to what was\nspoken in the dream, and who should do away with the dreamer. But the\nlittle tailor was warned, and knew enough to correct his dream.\nThe complex of processes\u2014of suspension, subtraction, and\ninversion\u2014through which the affects of the dream thoughts finally become\nthose of the dream, may well be observed in the suitable synthesis of\ncompletely analysed dreams. I shall here treat a few cases of emotional\nexcitement in the dream which furnish examples of some of the cases\ndiscussed.\nIn the dream about the odd task which the elder Bruecke gives me to\nperform\u2014of preparing my own pelvis\u2014the _appropriate horror is absent in\nthe dream itself_. Now this is a wish-fulfilment in various senses.\nPreparation signifies self-analysis, which I accomplish, as it were, by\npublishing my book on dreams, and which has been so disagreeable to me\nthat I have already postponed printing the finished manuscript for more\nthan a year. The wish is now actuated that I may disregard this feeling\nof opposition, and for that reason I feel no horror (_Grauen_, which\nalso means to grow grey) in the dream. I should also like to escape the\nhorror\u2014in the other (German) sense\u2014of growing grey; for I am already\ngrowing grey fast, and the grey in my hair warns me withal to hold back\nno longer. For we know that at the end of the dream the thought secures\nexpression in that I should have to leave my children to get to the goal\nof their difficult journey.\nIn the two dreams that shift the expression of satisfaction to the\nmoments immediately after awakening, this satisfaction is in the one\ncase motivated by the expectation that I am now going to learn what is\nmeant by \u201cI have already dreamed of it,\u201d and refers in reality to the\nbirth of my first child, and in the other case it is motivated by the\nconviction that \u201cthat which has been announced by a sign\u201d is now going\nto happen, and the latter satisfaction is the same which I felt at the\narrival of my second son. Here the same emotions that dominated in the\ndream thoughts have remained in the dream, but the process is probably\nnot so simple as this in every dream. If the two analyses are examined a\nlittle, it will be seen that this satisfaction which does not succumb to\nthe censor receives an addition from a source which must fear the\ncensor; and the emotion drawn from this source would certainly arouse\nopposition if it did not cloak itself in a similar emotion of\nsatisfaction that is willingly admitted, if it did not, as it were,\nsneak in behind the other. Unfortunately, I am unable to show this in\nthe case of the actual dream specimen, but an example from another\nprovince will make my meaning intelligible. I construct the following\ncase: Let there be a person near me whom I hate so that a strong feeling\narises in me that I should be glad if something were to happen to him.\nBut the moral part of my nature does not yield to this sentiment; I do\nnot dare to express this ill-wish, and when something happens to him\nwhich he does not deserve, I suppress my satisfaction at it, and force\nmyself to expressions and thoughts of regret. Everyone will have found\nhimself in such a position. But now let it happen that the hated person\ndraws upon himself a well-deserved misfortune by some fault; now I may\ngive free rein to my satisfaction that he has been visited by a just\npunishment, and I express opinion in the matter which coincides with\nthat of many other people who are impartial. But I can see that my\nsatisfaction turns out to be more intense than that of the others, for\nit has received an addition from another source\u2014from my hatred, which\nhas hitherto been prevented by the inner censor from releasing an\nemotion, but which is no longer prevented from doing so under the\naltered circumstances. This case is generally typical of society, where\npersons who have aroused antipathy or are adherents of an unpopular\nminority incur guilt. Their punishment does not correspond to their\ntransgression but to their transgression _plus_ the ill-will directed\nagainst them that has hitherto been ineffective. Those who execute the\npunishment doubtless commit an injustice, but they are prevented from\nbecoming aware of it by the satisfaction arising from the release within\nthemselves of a suppression of long standing. In such cases the emotion\nis justified according to its quality, but not according to its\nquantity; and the self-criticism that has been appeased as to the one\npoint is only too ready to neglect examination of the second point. Once\nyou have opened the doors, more people get through than you originally\nintended to admit.\nThe striking feature of the neurotic character, that incitements capable\nof producing emotion bring about a result that is qualitatively\njustified but is quantitatively excessive, is to be explained in this\nmanner, in so far as it admits of a psychological explanation at all.\nThe excess is due to sources of emotion which have remained unconscious\nand have hitherto been suppressed, which can establish in the\nassociations a connection with the actual incitement, and which can thus\nfind release for its emotions through the vent which the unobjectionable\nand admitted source of emotion opens. Our attention is thus called to\nthe fact that we may not consider the relation of mutual restraint as\nobtaining exclusively between the suppressed and the suppressing psychic\njudgment. The cases in which the two judgments bring about a\npathological emotion by co-operation and mutual strengthening deserve\njust as much attention. The reader is requested to apply these hints\nregarding the psychic mechanism for the purpose of understanding the\nexpressions of emotion in the dream. A satisfaction which makes its\nappearance in the dream, and which may readily be found at its proper\nplace in the dream thoughts, may not always be fully explained by means\nof this reference. As a rule it will be necessary to search for a second\nsource in the dream thoughts, upon which the pressure of the censor is\nexerted, and which under the pressure would have resulted not in\nsatisfaction, but in the opposite emotion\u2014which, however, is enabled by\nthe presence of the first source to free its satisfaction affect from\nsuppression and to reinforce the satisfaction springing from the other\nsource. Hence emotions in the dream appear as though formed by the\nconfluence of several tributaries, and as though over-determined in\nreference to the material of the dream thoughts; _sources of affect\nwhich can furnish the same affect join each other in the dream activity\nin order to produce it_.[FE]\nSome insight into these tangled relations is gained from analysis of the\nadmirable dream in which \u201cNon vixit\u201d constitutes the central point\n(_cf._ p. 333). The expressions of emotion in this dream, which are of\ndifferent qualities, are forced together at two points in the manifest\ncontent. Hostile and painful feelings (in the dream itself we have the\nphrase, \u201cseized by strange emotions\u201d) overlap at the point where I\ndestroy my antagonistic friend with the two words. At the end of the\ndream I am greatly pleased, and am quite ready to believe in a\npossibility which I recognise as absurd when I am awake, namely, that\nthere are _revenants_ who can be put out of the way by a mere wish.\nI have not yet mentioned the occasion for this dream. It is an\nessential one, and goes a long way towards explaining it. I had\nreceived the news from my friend in Berlin (whom I have designated as\nF.) that he is about to undergo an operation and that relatives of his\nliving in Vienna would give me information about his condition. The\nfirst few messages after the operation were not reassuring, and caused\nme anxiety. I should have liked best to go to him myself, but at that\ntime I was affected with a painful disease which made every movement a\ntorture for me. I learn from the dream thoughts that I feared for the\nlife of my dear friend. I knew that his only sister, with whom I had\nnot been acquainted, had died early after the shortest possible\nillness. (In the dream _F. tells about his sister, and says: \u201cIn\nthree-quarters of an hour she was dead.\u201d_) I must have imagined that\nhis own constitution was not much stronger, and that I should soon be\ntravelling, in spite of my health, in answer to far worse news\u2014and\nthat I should arrive too _late_, for which I should reproach myself\nfor ever.[FF] This reproach about arriving too late has become the\ncentral point of the dream, but has been represented in a scene in\nwhich the honoured teacher of my student years\u2014Bruecke\u2014reproaches me\nfor the same thing with a terrible look from his blue eyes. The cause\nof this deviation from the scene will soon be clear; the dream cannot\nreproduce the scene itself in the manner in which it occurred to me.\nTo be sure, it leaves the blue eyes to the other man, but it gives me\nthe part of the annihilator, an inversion which is obviously the\nresult of the wish-fulfilment. My concern for the life of my friend,\nmy self-reproach for not having gone to him, my shame (he had\nrepeatedly come to me in Vienna), my desire to consider myself excused\non account of my illness\u2014all of this makes up a tempest of feeling\nwhich is distinctly felt in sleep, and which raged in every part of\nthe dream thoughts.\nBut there was another thing about the occasion for the dream which had\nquite the opposite effect. With the unfavourable news during the first\ndays of the operation, I also received the injunction to speak to no one\nabout the whole affair, which hurt my feelings, for it betrayed an\nunnecessary distrust of my discretion. I knew, of course, that this\nrequest did not proceed from my friend, but that it was due to\nclumsiness or excessive timidity on the part of the messenger, but the\nconcealed reproach made me feel very badly because it was not altogether\nunjustified. Only reproaches which \u201chave something in them\u201d have power\nto irritate, as everyone knows. For long before, in the case of two\npersons who were friendly to each other and who were willing to honour\nme with their friendship, I had quite needlessly tattled what the one\nhad said about the other; to be sure this incident had nothing to do\nwith the affairs of my friend F. Nor have I forgotten the reproaches\nwhich I had to listen to at that time. One of the two friends between\nwhom I was the trouble-maker was Professor Fleischl; the other one I may\nname Joseph, a name which was also borne by my friend and antagonist P.,\nwho appears in the dream.\nTwo dream elements, first _inconspicuously_, and secondly the question\nof _Fl. as to how much of his affairs I have mentioned to P._, give\nevidence of the reproach that I am incapable of keeping anything to\nmyself. But it is the admixture of these recollections which transposes\nthe reproach for arriving too late from the present to the time when I\nwas living in Bruecke\u2019s laboratory; and by replacing the second person\nin the annihilation scene of the dream by a Joseph I succeed in\nrepresenting not only the first reproach that I arrive too late, but\nalso a second reproach, which is more rigorously suppressed, that I keep\nno secrets. The condensing and replacing activity of this dream, as well\nas the motives for it, are now obvious.\nMy anger at the injunction not to give anything away, originally quite\ninsignificant, receives confirmation from sources that flow far below\nthe surface, and so become a swollen stream of hostile feelings towards\npersons who are in reality dear to me. The source which furnishes the\nconfirmation is to be found in childhood. I have already said that my\nfriendships as well as my enmities with persons of my own age go back to\nmy childish relations with my nephew, who was a year older than I. In\nthese he had the upper hand, and I early learned how to defend myself;\nwe lived together inseparably, loved each other, and at the same time,\nas statements of older persons testify, scuffled with and accused each\nother. In a certain sense all my friends are incarnations of this first\nfigure, \u201cwhich early appeared to my blurred sight\u201d; they are all\n_revenants_. My nephew himself returned in the years of adolescence, and\nthen we acted C\u00e6sar and Brutus. An intimate friend and a hated enemy\nhave always been indispensable requirements for my emotional life; I\nhave always been able to create them anew, and not infrequently my\nchildish ideal has been so closely approached that friend and enemy\ncoincided in the same person, not simultaneously, of course, nor in\nrepeated alterations, as had been the case in my first childhood years.\nI do not here wish to trace the manner in which a recent occasion for\nemotion may reach back to one in childhood\u2014through connections like\nthese I have just described\u2014in order to find a substitute for itself, in\nthis earlier occasion for the sake of increased emotional effect. Such\nan investigation would belong to the psychology of the unconscious, and\nwould find its place in a psychological explanation of neuroses. Let us\nassume for the purposes of dream interpretation that a childhood\nrecollection makes its appearance or is formed by the fancy, say to the\nfollowing effect: Two children get into a fight on account of some\nobject\u2014just what we shall leave undecided, although memory or an\nallusion of memory has a very definite one in mind\u2014and each one claims\nthat he got to it first, and that he, therefore, has first right to it.\nThey come to blows, for might makes right; and, according to the\nintimation of the dream, I must have known that I was in the wrong\n(_noticing the error myself_), but this time I remain the stronger and\ntake possession of the battlefield; the defeated combatant hurries to my\nfather, his grandfather, and accuses me, and I defend myself with the\nwords which I know from my father: \u201c_I hit him because he hit me._\u201d Thus\nthis recollection, or more probably fancy, which forces itself upon my\nattention in the course of the analysis\u2014from my present knowledge I\nmyself do not know how\u2014becomes an intermediary of the dream thoughts\nthat collects the emotional excitements obtaining in the dream thoughts,\nas the bowl of a fountain collects the streams of water flowing into it.\nFrom this point the dream thoughts flow along the following paths: \u201cIt\nserves you quite right if you had to vacate your place for me; why did\nyou try to force me out of my place? I don\u2019t need you; I\u2019ll soon find\nsomeone else to play with,\u201d &c. Then the ways are opened through which\nthese thoughts again follow into the representation of the dream. For\nsuch an \u201c\u00f4te-toi que je m\u2019y mette\u201d I once had to reproach my deceased\nfriend Joseph. He had been next to me in the line of promotion in\nBruecke\u2019s laboratory, but advancement there was very slow. Neither of\nthe two assistants budged from his place, and youth became impatient. My\nfriend, who knew that his time of life was limited, and who was bound by\nno tie to his superior, was a man seriously ill; the wish for his\nremoval permitted an objectionable interpretation\u2014he might be moved by\nsomething besides promotion. Several years before, the same wish for\nfreedom had naturally been more intense in my own case; wherever in the\nworld there are gradations of rank and advancement, the doors are opened\nfor wishes needing suppression. Shakespeare\u2019s Prince Hal cannot get rid\nof the temptation to see how the crown fits even at the bed of his sick\nfather. But, as may easily be understood, the dream punishes this\nruthless wish not upon me but upon him.[FG]\n\u201cAs he was ambitious, I slew him.\u201d As he could not wait for the other\nman to make way for him, he himself has been put out of the way. I\nharbour these thoughts immediately after attending the unveiling of the\nstatue to the other man at the university. A part of the satisfaction\nwhich I feel in the dream may therefore be interpreted: Just punishment;\nit served you right.\nAt the funeral of this friend a young man made the following remark,\nwhich seemed out of place: \u201cThe preacher talked as though the world\ncouldn\u2019t exist without this one human being.\u201d The displeasure of the\nsincere man, whose sorrow has been marred by the exaggeration, begins to\narise in him. But with this speech are connected the dream thoughts: \u201cNo\none is really irreplaceable; how many men have I already escorted to the\ngrave, but I am still living, I have survived them all, I claim the\nfield.\u201d Such a thought at the moment when I fear that when I travel to\nsee him I shall find my friend no longer among the living, permits only\nof the further development that I am glad I am surviving someone, that\nit is not I who have died, but he\u2014that I occupy the field as I once did\nin the fancied scene in childhood. This satisfaction, coming from\nsources in childhood, at the fact that I claim the field, covers the\nlarger part of the emotion which appears in the dream. I am glad that I\nam the survivor\u2014I express this sentiment with the na\u00efve egotism of the\nhusband who says to his wife: \u201cIf one of us dies, I shall move to\nParis.\u201d It is such a matter of course for my expectation that I am not\nto be the one.\nIt cannot be denied that great self-control is necessary to interpret\none\u2019s dreams and to report them. It is necessary for you to reveal\nyourself as the one scoundrel among all the noble souls with whom you\nshare the breath of life. Thus, I consider it quite natural that\n_revenants_ exist only as long as they are wanted, and that they can be\nobviated by a wish. This is the thing for which my friend Joseph has\nbeen punished. But the _revenants_ are the successive incarnations of\nthe friend of my childhood; I am also satisfied at the fact that I have\nreplaced this person for myself again and again, and a substitute will\ndoubtless soon be found even for the friend whom I am about to lose. No\none is irreplaceable.\nBut what has the dream censor been doing meanwhile? Why does it not\nraise the most emphatic objection to a train of thought characterised by\nsuch brutal selfishness, and change the satisfaction that adheres to it\ninto profound repugnance? I think it is because other unobjectionable\ntrains of thought likewise result in satisfaction and cover the emotion\ncoming from forbidden infantile sources with their own. In another\nstratum of thought I said to myself at that festive unveiling: \u201cI have\nlost so many dear friends, some through death, some through the\ndissolution of friendship\u2014is it not beautiful that I have found\nsubstitutes for them, that I have gained one who means more to me than\nthe others could, whom I shall from now on always retain, at the age\nwhen it is not easy to form new friendships?\u201d The satisfaction that I\nhave found this substitute for lost friends can be taken over into the\ndream without interference, but behind it there sneaks in the inimical\nsatisfaction from the infantile source. Childish affection undoubtedly\nassists in strengthening the justifiable affection of to-day; but\nchildish hatred has also found its way into the representation.\nBut besides this there is distinct reference in the dream to another\nchain of thoughts, which may manifest itself in the form of\nsatisfaction. My friend had shortly before had a little daughter born,\nafter long waiting. I knew how much he had grieved for the sister whom\nhe lost at an early age, and I wrote to him that he would transfer to\nthis child the love he had felt for her. This little girl would at last\nmake him forget his irreparable loss.\nThus this chain also connects with the intermediary thoughts of the\nlatent dream content, from which the ways spread out in opposite\ndirections: No one is irreplaceable. You see, nothing but _revenants_;\nall that one has lost comes back. And now the bonds of association\nbetween the contradictory elements of the dream thoughts are more\ntightly drawn by the accidental circumstance that the little daughter of\nmy friend bears the same name as the girl playmate of my own youth, who\nwas just my own age and the sister of my oldest friend and antagonist. I\nhave heard the name \u201cPauline\u201d with _satisfaction_, and in order to\nallude to this coincidence I have replaced one Joseph in the dream by\nanother Joseph, and have not overlooked the similarity in sound between\nthe names Fleischl and F. From this point a train of thought runs to the\nnaming of my own children. I insisted that the names should not be\nchosen according to the fashion of the day but should be determined by\nregard for the memory of beloved persons. The children\u2019s names make them\n\u201c_revenants_.\u201d And, finally, is not the having of children the only\naccess to immortality for us all?\nI shall add only a few remarks about the emotions of the dream from\nanother point of view. An emotional inclination\u2014what we call a mood\u2014may\noccur in the mind of a sleeping person as its dominating element, and\nmay induce a corresponding mood in the dream. This mood may be the\nresult of the experiences and thoughts of the day, or it may be of\nsomatic origin; in either case it will be accompanied by the chains of\nthought that correspond to it. The fact that in the one case this\npresentation content conditions the emotional inclination primarily, and\nthat in the other case it is brought about secondarily by a disposition\nof feeling of somatic origin remains without influence upon the\nformation of the dream. This formation is always subject to the\nrestriction that it can represent only a wish-fulfilment, and that it\nmay put its psychic motive force at the service only of the wish. The\nmood that is actually present will receive the same treatment as the\nsensation which actually comes to the surface during sleep (_cf._ p.\n198), which is either neglected or reinterpreted so as to signify a\nwish-fulfilment. Disagreeable moods during sleep become a motive force\nof the dream by actuating energetic wishes, which the dream must fulfil.\nThe material to which they are attached is worked over until it finally\nbecomes suitable for the expression of the fulfilled wish. The more\nintense and the more dominating the element of the disagreeable mood in\nthe dream thought, the more surely will the wish-impulses that have been\nmost rigorously suppressed take advantage of the opportunity to secure\nrepresentation, for they find that the difficult part of the work\nnecessary in securing representation has already been accomplished in\nthat the repugnance is already actually in existence, which they would\notherwise have had to produce by their own effort. With this discussion\nwe again touch upon the problem of anxiety dreams, which we may regard\nas bounding the province of the dream activity.\n(_h_) _Secondary Elaboration._\nWe may at last proceed to an exposition of the fourth of the factors\nwhich take part in the formation of the dream.\nIf we continue the examination of the dream content, in the manner\nalready outlined\u2014that is, by testing striking occurrences as to their\norigin in the dream thoughts\u2014we encounter elements which can be\nexplained only by making an entirely new assumption. I have in mind\ncases where one shows astonishment, anger, or resistance in a dream, and\nthat, too, against a party of the dream content itself. Most of these\nexercises of the critical faculty in dreams are not directed against the\ndream content, but prove to be portions of dream material which have\nbeen taken over and suitably made use of, as I have shown by fitting\nexamples. Some things of this sort, however, cannot be disposed of in\nsuch a way; their correlative cannot be found in the dream material.\nWhat, for instance, is meant by the criticism not infrequent in dreams:\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s only a dream\u201d? This is a genuine criticism of the dream such\nas I might make if I were awake. Not at all infrequently it is the\nforerunner to waking; still oftener it is preceded by a painful feeling,\nwhich subsides when the certainty of the dream state has been\nestablished. The thought: \u201cBut it\u2019s only a dream,\u201d occurring during the\ndream, has the same object which is meant to be conveyed on the stage\nthrough the mouth of the beautiful Helen von Offenbach; it wants to\nminimise what has just occurred and secure indulgence for what is to\nfollow. Its purpose is to reassure and, so to speak, put to sleep a\ncertain instance which at the given moment has every reason to be active\nand to forbid the continuation of the dream\u2014or the scene. It is\npleasanter to go on sleeping and to tolerate the dream, \u201cbecause it\u2019s\nonly a dream anyway.\u201d I imagine that the disparaging criticism, \u201cBut\nit\u2019s only a dream,\u201d enters into the dream at the moment when the censor,\nwhich has never been quite asleep, feels that it has been surprised by\nthe already admitted dream. It is too late to suppress the dream, and\nthe instance therefore carries with it that note of fear or of painful\nfeeling which presents itself in the dream. It is an expression of the\n_esprit d\u2019escalier_ on the part of the psychic censor.\nIn this example we have faultless proof that not everything which the\ndream contains comes from the dream thoughts, but that a psychic\nfunction which cannot be differentiated from our waking thoughts may\nmake contributions to the dream content. The question now is, does this\noccur only in altogether exceptional cases, or does the psychic instance\nwhich is usually active only as censor take a regular part in the\nformation of dreams?\nOne must decide unhesitatingly for the latter view. It is indisputable\nthat the censoring instance, whose influence we have so far recognised\nonly in limitations and omissions in the dream content, is also\nresponsible for interpolations and amplifications in this content. Often\nthese interpolations are easily recognised; they are reported\nirresolutely, prefaced by an \u201cas if,\u201d they are not in themselves\nparticularly vivid, and are regularly inserted at points where they may\nserve to connect two portions of the dream content or improve the\nsequence between two sections of the dream. They manifest less ability\nto stick in the memory than genuine products of the dream material; if\nthe dream is subject to forgetting, they are the first to fall away, and\nI am strongly inclined to believe that our frequent complaint that we\nhave dreamed so much, that we have forgotten most of this and have\nremembered only fragments of it, rests on the immediate falling away of\njust these cementing thoughts. In a complete analysis these\ninterpolations are often betrayed by the fact that no material is to be\nfound for them in the dream thoughts. But after careful examination I\nmust designate this case as a rare one; usually interpolated thoughts\ncan be traced to an element in the dream thoughts, which, however, can\nclaim a place in the dream neither on account of its own merit nor on\naccount of over-determination. The psychic function in dream formation,\nwhich we are now considering, aspires to the original creations only in\nthe most extreme cases; whenever possible, it makes use of anything\navailable it can find in the dream material.\nThe thing which distinguishes and reveals this part of the dream\nactivity is its tendency. This function proceeds in a manner similar to\nthat which the poet spitefully attributes to the philosopher; with its\nscraps and rags, it stops up the breaches in the structure of the dream.\nThe result of its effort is that the dream loses the appearance of\nabsurdity and incoherence, and approaches the pattern of an intelligible\nexperience. But the effort is not always crowned with complete success.\nThus dreams occur which may seem faultlessly logical and correct upon\nsuperficial examination; they start from a possible situation, continue\nit by means of consistent changes, and end up\u2014although this is very\nrare\u2014with a not unnatural conclusion. These dreams have been subjected\nto the most thorough elaboration at the hands of a psychic function\nsimilar to our waking thought; they seem to have a meaning, but this\nmeaning is very far removed from the real signification of the dream. If\nthey are analysed, one is convinced that the secondary elaboration has\ndistorted the material very freely, and has preserved its proper\nrelations as little as possible. These are the dreams which have, so to\nspeak, already been interpreted before we subject them to waking\ninterpretation. In other dreams this purposeful elaboration has been\nsuccessful only to a certain point; up to this point consistency seems\nto be dominant, then the dream becomes nonsensical or confused, and\nperhaps finally it lifts itself for a second time in its course to an\nappearance of rationality. In still other dreams the elaboration has\nfailed completely; we find ourselves helpless in the presence of a\nsenseless mass of fragmentary contents.\nI do not wish to deny to this fourth dream-moulding power, which will\nsoon seem to us a familiar one\u2014it is in reality the only one among the\nfour dream-moulders with which we are familiar,\u2014I do not wish to deny\nthis fourth factor the capability of creatively furnishing the dream\nwith new contributions. But surely its influence, like that of the\nothers, manifests itself preponderatingly in the preferring and choosing\nof already created psychic material in the dream thoughts. Now there is\na case where it is spared the work, for the most part, of building, as\nit were, a fa\u00e7ade to the dream, by the fact that such a structure,\nwaiting to be used, is already to be found complete in the material of\nthe dream thoughts. The element of the dream thoughts which I have in\nmind, I am in the habit of designating as a \u201cphantasy\u201d; perhaps I shall\navoid misunderstanding if I immediately adduce the day dream of waking\nlife as an analogy.[FH] The part played by this element in our psychic\nlife has not yet been fully recognised and investigated by the\npsychiatrists; in this study M. Benedikt has, it seems to me, made a\nhighly promising beginning. The significance of the day dream has not\nyet escaped the unerring insight of poets; the description of the day\ndreams of one of his subordinate characters which A. Daudet gives us in\n_Nabab_ is universally known. A study of the psychoneuroses discloses\nthe astonishing fact that these phantasies or day dreams are the\nimmediate predecessors of hysterical symptoms\u2014at least of a great many\nof them; hysterical symptoms directly depend not upon the memories\nthemselves, but upon phantasies built on the basis of memories. The\nfrequent occurrence of conscious day phantasies brings these formations\nwithin the scope of our knowledge; but just as there are such conscious\nphantasies, so there are a great many unconscious ones, which must\nremain unconscious on account of their content and on account of their\norigin from repressed material. A more thorough examination into the\ncharacter of these day phantasies shows with what good reason the same\nname has been given to these formations as to the products of our\nnocturnal thought,\u2014dreams. They possess an essential part of their\nproperties in common with nocturnal dreams; an examination of them would\nreally have afforded the shortest and best approach to an understanding\nof night dreams.\nLike dreams, they are fulfilments of wishes; like dreams a good part of\nthem are based upon the impressions of childish experiences; like dreams\ntheir creations enjoy a certain amount of indulgence from the censor. If\nwe trace their formation, we see how the wish motive, which is active in\ntheir production, has taken the material of which they are built, mixed\nit together, rearranged it, and composed it into a new unit. They bear\nthe same relation to the childish memories, to which they go back, as\nsome of the quaint palaces of Rome bear to the ancient ruins, whose\nfreestones and pillars have furnished the material for the structure\nbuilt in modern form.\nIn the \u201csecondary elaboration\u201d of the dream content which we have\nascribed to our fourth dream-making factor, we again find the same\nactivity which in the creation of day dreams is allowed to manifest\nitself unhampered by other influences. We may say without further\npreliminary that this fourth factor of ours seeks to form something\n_like a day dream_ from the material at hand. Where, however, such a day\ndream has already been formed in connection with the dream thought, this\nfactor of the dream-work will preferably get control of it, and strive\nto introduce it into the dream content. There are dreams which consist\nmerely of the repetition of such a day fancy, a fancy which has perhaps\nremained unconscious\u2014as, for instance, the dream of the boy that he is\nriding with the heroes of the Trojan war in a war chariot. In my dream\n\u201cAutodidasker,\u201d at least the second part of the dream is the faithful\nrepetition of a day phantasy\u2014harmless in itself\u2014about my dealings with\nProfessor N. The fact that the phantasy thus provided more often forms\nonly one part of the dream, or that only one part of the phantasy that\nmakes its way to the dream content, has its origin in the complexity of\nthe conditions which the dream must satisfy at its genesis. On the\nwhole, the phantasy is treated like any other component of the latent\nmaterial; still it is often recognisable in the dream as a whole. In my\ndreams parts often occur which are emphasized by an impression different\nfrom that of the rest. They seem to me to be in a state of flux, to be\nmore coherent and at the same time more transient than other pieces of\nthe same dream. I know that these are unconscious phantasies which get\ninto the dream by virtue of their association, but I have never\nsucceeded in registering such a phantasy. For the rest these phantasies,\nlike all other component parts of the dream thoughts, are jumbled\ntogether and condensed, one covered up by another, and the like; but\nthere are all degrees, from the case where they may constitute the dream\ncontent or at least the dream fa\u00e7ade unchanged to the opposite case,\nwhere they are represented in the dream content by only one of their\nelements or by a remote allusion to such an element. The extent to which\nthe phantasies are able to withstand the demands of the censor and the\ntendency to condensation are, of course, also decisive of their fate\namong the dream thoughts.\nIn my choice of examples for dream analysis I have, wherever possible,\navoided those dreams in which unconscious fancies play a somewhat\nimportant part, because the introduction of this psychic element would\nhave necessitated extensive discussion of the psychology of unconscious\nthought. But I cannot entirely omit the \u201cphantasy\u201d even in this matter\nof examples, because it often gets fully into the dream and still more\noften distinctly pervades it. I may mention one more dream, which seems\nto be composed of two distinct and opposed phantasies, overlapping each\nother at certain places, of which the first is superficial, while the\nsecond becomes, as it were, the interpreter of the first.[FI]\nThe dream\u2014it is the only one for which I have no careful notes\u2014is about\nto this effect: The dreamer\u2014an unmarried young man\u2014is sitting in an inn,\nwhich is seen correctly; several persons come to get him, among them\nsomeone who wants to arrest him. He says to his table companions, \u201cI\nwill pay later, I am coming back.\u201d But they call to him, laughing\nscornfully: \u201cWe know all about that; that\u2019s what everybody says.\u201d One\nguest calls after him: \u201cThere goes another one.\u201d He is then led to a\nnarrow hall, where he finds a woman with a child in her arms. One of his\nescorts says: \u201cThat is Mr. M\u00fcller.\u201d A commissioner or some other\nofficial is running through a bundle of tickets or papers repeating\nM\u00fcller, M\u00fcller, M\u00fcller. At last the commissioner asks him a question,\nwhich he answers with \u201cYes.\u201d He then takes a look at the woman, and\nnotices that she has grown a large beard.\nThe two component parts are here easily separated. What is superficial\nis the _phantasy of being arrested_; it seems to be newly created by the\ndream-work. But behind it appears the _phantasy of marriage_, and this\nmaterial, on the contrary, has undergone but slight change at the hands\nof the dream activity. The features which are common to both phantasies\ncome into distinct prominence as in a Galton\u2019s composite photograph. The\npromise of the bachelor to come back to his place at the club table, the\nscepticism of the drinking companions, sophisticated in their many\nexperiences, the calling after: \u201cThere goes (marries) another one,\u201d\u2014all\nthese features can easily be capable of the other interpretation.\nLikewise the affirmative answer given to the official. Running through\nthe bundle of papers with the repetition of the name, corresponds to a\nsubordinate but well-recognised feature of the marriage ceremonies\u2014the\nreading aloud of the congratulatory telegrams which have arrived\nirregularly, and which, of course, are all addressed to the same name.\nIn the matter of the bride\u2019s personal appearance in this dream, the\nmarriage phantasy has even got the better of the arrest phantasy which\nconceals it. The fact that this bride finally displays a beard, I can\nexplain from an inquiry\u2014I had no chance to make an analysis. The dreamer\nhad on the previous day crossed the street with a friend who was just as\nhostile to marriage as himself, and had called his friend\u2019s attention to\na beautiful brunette who was coming towards them. The friend had\nremarked: \u201cYes, if only these women wouldn\u2019t get beards, as they grow\nolder, like their fathers.\u201d\nOf course there is no lack of elements in this dream, on which the dream\ndisfigurement has done more thorough work. Thus the speech: \u201cI will pay\nlater,\u201d may have reference to the conduct of the father-in-law in the\nmatter of dowry\u2014which is uncertain. Obviously all kinds of scruples are\npreventing the dreamer from surrendering himself with pleasure to the\nphantasy of marrying. One of these apprehensions\u2014lest one\u2019s freedom be\nlost when one marries\u2014has embodied itself in the transformation to a\nscene of arrest.\nLet us return to the thesis that the dream activity likes to make use of\na phantasy which is finished and at hand, instead of creating one afresh\nfrom the material of the dream thoughts; we shall perhaps solve one of\nthe most interesting riddles of the dream if we keep this fact in mind.\nI have on page 21 related the dream of Maury,[48] who is struck on the\nback of the neck with a stick, and who awakes in the possession of a\nlong dream\u2014a complete romance from the time of the French Revolution.\nSince the dream is represented as coherent and as explicable by\nreference to the disturbing stimulus alone, about the occurrence of\nwhich stimulus the sleeper could suspect nothing, only one assumption\nseems to be left, namely, that the whole richly elaborated dream must\nhave been composed and must have taken place in the short space of time\nbetween the falling of the stick on Maury\u2019s cervical vertebra and the\nawakening induced by the blow. We should not feel justified in ascribing\nsuch rapidity to the waking mental activity, and so are inclined to\ncredit the dream activity with a remarkable acceleration of thought as\none of its characteristics.\nAgainst this inference, which rapidly becomes popular, more recent\nauthors (Le Lorrain,[45] Egger,[20] and others) have made emphatic\nobjection. They partly doubt the correctness with which the dream was\nreported by Maury, and partly try to show that the rapidity of our\nwaking mental capacity is quite as great as that which we may concede\nwithout reservation to the dream activity. The discussion raises\nfundamental questions, the settlement of which I do not think concerns\nme closely. But I must admit that the argument, for instance, of Egger\nhas not impressed me as convincing against the guillotine dream of\nMaury. I would suggest the following explanation of this dream: Would it\nbe very improbable that the dream of Maury exhibits a phantasy which had\nbeen preserved in his memory in a finished state for years, and which\nwas awakened\u2014I should rather say alluded to\u2014at the moment when he became\naware of the disturbing stimulus? The difficulty of composing such a\nlong story with all its details in the exceedingly short space of time\nwhich is here at the disposal of the dreamer then disappears; the story\nis already composed. If the stick had struck Maury\u2019s neck when he was\nawake there would perhaps have been time for the thought: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s\nlike being guillotined.\u201d But as he is struck by the stick while asleep,\nthe dream activity quickly finds occasion in the incoming stimulus to\nconstruct a wish-fulfilment, as though it thought (this is to be taken\nentirely figuratively): \u201cHere is a good opportunity to realise the wish\nphantasy which I formed at such and such a time while I was reading.\u201d\nThat this dream romance is just such a one as a youth would be likely to\nfashion under the influence of powerful impressions does not seem\nquestionable to me. Who would not have been carried away\u2014especially a\nFrenchman and a student of the history of civilisation\u2014by descriptions\nof the Reign of Terror, in which the aristocracy, men and women, the\nflower of the nation, showed that it was possible to die with a light\nheart, and preserved their quick wit and refinement of life until the\nfatal summons? How tempting to fancy one\u2019s self in the midst of all this\nas one of the young men who parts from his lady with a kiss of the hand\nto climb fearlessly upon the scaffold! Or perhaps ambition is the ruling\nmotive of the phantasy\u2014the ambition to put one\u2019s self in the place of\none of those powerful individuals who merely, by the force of their\nthinking and their fiery eloquence, rule the city in which the heart of\nmankind is beating so convulsively, who are impelled by conviction to\nsend thousands of human beings to their death, and who pave the way for\nthe transformation of Europe; who, meanwhile, are not sure of their own\nheads, and may one day lay them under the knife of the guillotine,\nperhaps in the r\u00f4le of one of the Girondists or of the hero Danton? The\nfeature, \u201caccompanied by an innumerable multitude,\u201d which is preserved\nin the memory, seems to show that Maury\u2019s phantasy is an ambitious one\nof this sort.\nBut this phantasy, which has for a long time been ready, need not be\nexperienced again in sleep; it suffices if it is, so to speak, \u201ctouched\noff.\u201d What I mean is this: If a few notes are struck and someone says,\nas in _Don Juan_: \u201cThat is from _Figaro\u2019s Wedding_ by Mozart,\u201d memories\nsuddenly surge up within me, none of which I can in the next moment\nrecall to consciousness. The characteristic phrase serves as an entrance\nstation from which a complete whole is simultaneously put in motion. It\nneed not be different in the case of unconscious thought. The psychic\nstation which opens the way to the whole guillotine phantasy is set in\nmotion by the waking stimulus. This phantasy, however, is not passed in\nreview during sleep, but only afterwards in waking memory. Upon\nawakening one remembers the details of the phantasy, which in the dream\nwas regarded as a whole. There is, withal, no means of making sure that\none really has remembered anything which has been dreamed. The same\nexplanation, namely, that one is dealing with finished phantasies which\nhave been set in motion as wholes by the waking stimulus, may be applied\nto still other dreams which proceed from a waking stimulus\u2014for instance\nto the battle dream of Napoleon at the explosion of the bomb. I do not\nmean to assert that all waking dreams admit of this explanation, or that\nthe problem of the accelerated discharge of ideas in dreams is to be\naltogether solved in this manner.\nWe must not neglect the relation of this secondary elaboration of the\ndream content to the other factors in the dream activity. Might the\nprocedure be as follows: the dream-creating factors, the impulse to\ncondense, the necessity of evading the censor, and the regard for\ndramatic fitness in the psychic resources of the dream\u2014these first of\nall create a provisional dream content, and this is then subsequently\nmodified until it satisfies the exactions of a second instance? This is\nhardly probable. It is necessary rather to assume that the demands of\nthis instance are from the very beginning lodged in one of the\nconditions which the dream must satisfy, and that this condition, just\nlike those of condensation, of censorship, and of dramatic fitness,\nsimultaneously affect the whole mass of material in the dream thoughts\nin an inductive and selective manner. But of the four conditions\nnecessary for the dream formation, the one last recognised is the one\nwhose exactions appear to be least binding upon the dream. That this\npsychic function, which undertakes the so-called secondary elaboration\nof the dream content is identical with the work of our waking thought\nmay be inferred with great probability from the following\nconsideration:\u2014Our waking (foreconscious) thought behaves towards a\ngiven object of perception just exactly as the function in question\nbehaves towards the dream content. It is natural for our waking thought\nto bring about order in the material of perception, to construct\nrelationships, and to make it subject to the requirements of an\nintelligible coherence. Indeed, we go too far in doing this; the tricks\nof prestidigitators deceive us by taking advantage of this intellectual\nhabit. In our effort to put together the sensory impressions which are\noffered to us in a comprehensible manner, we often commit the most\nbizarre errors and even distort the truth of the material we have before\nus. Proofs for this are too generally familiar to need more extended\nconsideration here. We fail to see errors in a printed page because our\nimagination pictures the proper words. The editor of a widely-read\nFrench paper is said to have risked the wager that he could print the\nwords \u201cfrom in front\u201d or \u201cfrom behind\u201d in every sentence of a long\narticle without any of his readers noticing it. He won the wager. A\ncurious example of incorrect associations years ago caught my attention\nin a newspaper. After the session of the French chamber, at which Dupuy\nquelled a panic caused by the explosion of a bomb thrown into the hall\nby an anarchist by saying calmly, \u201cLa s\u00e9ance continue,\u201d the visitors in\nthe gallery were asked to testify as to their impression of the\nattempted assassination. Among them were two provincials. One of these\ntold that immediately after the conclusion of a speech he had heard a\ndetonation, but had thought that it was the custom in parliament to fire\na shot whenever a speaker had finished. The other, who had apparently\nalready heard several speakers, had got the same idea, with the\nvariation, however, that he supposed this shooting to be a sign of\nappreciation following an especially successful speech.\nThus the psychic instance which approaches the dream content with the\ndemand that it must be intelligible, which subjects it to preliminary\ninterpretation, and in doing so brings about a complete misunderstanding\nof it, is no other than our normal thought. In our interpretation the\nrule will be in every case to disregard the apparent coherence of the\ndream as being of suspicious origin, and, whether the elements are clear\nor confused, to follow the same regressive path to the dream material.\nWe now learn upon what the scale of quality in dreams from confusion to\nclearness\u2014mentioned above, page 305\u2014essentially depends. Those parts of\nthe dream with which the secondary elaboration has been able to\naccomplish something seem to us clear; those where the power of this\nactivity has failed seem confused. Since the confused parts of the dream\nare often also those which are less vividly imprinted, we may conclude\nthat the secondary dream-work is also responsible for a contribution to\nthe plastic intensity of the individual dream structures.\nIf I were to seek an object of comparison for the definitive formation\nof the dream as it manifests itself under the influence of normal\nthinking, none better offers itself than those mysterious inscriptions\nwith which _Die Fliegende Blaetter_ has so long amused its readers. The\nreader is supposed to find a Latin inscription concealed in a given\nsentence which, for the sake of contrast, is in dialect and as\nscurrilous as possible in significance. For this purpose the letters are\ntaken from their groupings in syllables and are newly arranged. Now and\nthen a genuine Latin word results, at other places we think that we have\nabbreviations of such words before us, and at still other places in the\ninscription we allow ourselves to be carried along over the\nsenselessness of the disjointed letters by the semblance of\ndisintegrated portions or by breaks in the inscription. If we do not\nwish to respond to the jest we must give up looking for an inscription,\nmust take the letters as we see them, and must compose them into words\nof our mother tongue, unmindful of the arrangement which is offered.\nI shall now undertake a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of this extended discussion of the dream\nactivity. We were confronted by the question whether the mind exerts all\nits capabilities to the fullest development in dream formation, or only\na fragment of its capabilities, and these restricted in their activity.\nOur investigation leads us to reject such a formulation of the question\nentirely as inadequate to our circumstances. But if we are to remain on\nthe same ground when we answer as that on which the question is urged\nupon us, we must acquiesce in two conceptions which are apparently\nopposed and mutually exclusive. The psychic activity in dream formation\nresolves itself into two functions\u2014the provision of the dream thoughts\nand the transformation of these into the dream content. The dream\nthoughts are entirely correct, and are formed with all the psychic\nexpenditure of which we are capable; they belong to our thoughts which\nhave not become conscious, from which our thoughts which have become\nconscious also result by means of a certain transposition. Much as there\nmay be about them which is worth knowing and mysterious, these problems\nhave no particular relation to the dream, and have no claim to be\ntreated in connection with dream problems. On the other hand, there is\nthat second portion of the activity which changes the unconscious\nthoughts into the dream content, an activity peculiar to dream life and\ncharacteristic of it. Now, this peculiar dream-work is much further\nremoved from the model of waking thought than even the most decided\ndepreciators of psychic activity in dream formation have thought. It is\nnot, one might say, more negligent, more incorrect, more easily\nforgotten, more incomplete than waking thought; it is something\nqualitatively altogether different from waking thought, and therefore\nnot in any way comparable to it. It does not in general think,\ncalculate, or judge at all, but limits itself to transforming. It can be\nexhaustively described if the conditions which must be satisfied at its\ncreation are kept in mind. This product, the dream, must at any cost be\nwithdrawn from the censor, and for this purpose the dream activity makes\nuse of the _displacement of psychic intensities_ up to the\ntransvaluation of all psychic values; thoughts must exclusively or\npredominatingly be reproduced in the material of visual and acoustic\ntraces of memory, and this requirement secures for the dream-work the\n_regard for presentability_, which meets the requirement by furnishing\nnew displacements. Greater intensities are (probably) to be provided\nthan are each night at the disposal of the dream thoughts, and this\npurpose is served by the prolific _condensation_ which is undertaken\nwith the component parts of the dream thoughts. Little attention is paid\nto the logical relations of the thought material; they ultimately find a\nveiled representation in the _formal_ peculiarities of the dream. The\naffects of the dream thoughts undergo lesser changes than their\npresentation content. As a rule they are suppressed; where they are\npreserved they are freed from the presentations and put together\naccording to their similarity. Only one part of the dream-work\u2014the\nrevision varying in amount, made by the partially roused conscious\nthought\u2014at all agrees with the conception which the authors have tried\nto extend to the entire activity of dream formation.\nVII\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DREAM ACTIVITIES\nAmong the dreams which I have heard from others there is one which at\nthis point is especially worthy of our attention. It was told to me by a\nfemale patient who in turn had heard it in a lecture on dreams. Its\noriginal source is unknown to me. This dream evidently made a deep\nimpression upon the lady, as she went so far as to imitate it, _i.e._ to\nrepeat the elements of this dream in a dream of her own in order to\nexpress by this transference her agreement with it in a certain point.\nThe essential facts of this illustrative dream are as follows: For days\nand nights a father had watched at the sick-bed of his child. After the\nchild died, he retired to rest in an adjoining room, leaving the door\najar, however, so as to enable him to look from his room into the other,\nwhere the corpse lay surrounded by burning candles. An old man, who was\nleft as a watch, sat near the corpse murmuring prayers. After sleeping a\nfew hours the father dreamed that _the child stood near his bed clasping\nhis arms and calling out reproachfully, \u201cFather, don\u2019t you see that I am\nburning?\u201d_ The father woke and noticed a bright light coming from the\nadjoining room. Rushing in, he found the old man asleep, and the covers\nand one arm of the beloved body burned by the fallen candle.\nThe meaning of this affecting dream is simple enough, and the\nexplanation given by the lecturer, as my patient reported it, was\ncorrect. The bright light coming through the open door into the eyes of\nthe sleeper produced the same impression on him as if he had been awake;\nnamely, that a fire had been started near the corpse by a falling\ncandle. It is quite possible that on going to sleep he feared that the\naged guardian was not equal to his task.\nWe can find nothing to change in this interpretation. We can add only\nthat the contents of the dream must be over-determined, and that the\ntalking of the child consisted of phrases that it had uttered while\nstill living, which recalled to the father important events. Perhaps the\ncomplaint, \u201cI am burning,\u201d recalled the fever from which the child died,\nand the words quoted, \u201cFather, don\u2019t you see?\u201d recalled an emotional\noccurrence unknown to us.\nBut after we have recognised the dream as a senseful occurrence which\ncan be correlated with our psychic existence, it may be surprising that\na dream should have taken place under circumstances which necessitated\nsuch immediate awakening. We also notice that the dream does not lack\nthe wish-fulfilment. The child acts as if living; it warns the father\nitself; it comes to his bed and clasps his arms, as it probably did on\nthe occasion which gave origin to the first part of the speech in the\ndream. It was for the sake of this wish-fulfilment that the father slept\na moment longer. The dream triumphed over the conscious reflection\nbecause it could show the child once more alive. If the father had\nawakened first, and had then drawn the conclusion which led him into the\nadjoining room, he would have shortened the child\u2019s life by this one\nmoment.\nThe peculiar feature in this brief dream which engages our interest is\nquite plain. So far we have mainly endeavoured to ascertain wherein the\nsecret meaning of the dream consists, in what way this is to be\ndiscovered, and what means the dream-work uses to conceal it. In other\nwords, our greatest interest has hitherto centred on the problems of\ninterpretation. We now encounter a dream, however, which can be easily\nexplained, the sense of which is plainly presented; and we notice that\nin spite of this fact the dream still preserves the essential features\nwhich plainly differentiate our dreaming from our conscious thinking,\nand thus clearly demands an explanation. After clearing up all the\nproblems of interpretation, we can still feel how imperfect our\npsychology of the dream is.\nBefore entering, however, into this new territory, let us stop and\nreflect whether we have not missed something important on our way\nhither. For it must be frankly admitted that we have been traversing the\neasy and comfortable part of our journey. Hitherto all the paths we have\nfollowed have led, if I mistake not, to light, to explication, and to\nfull understanding, but from the moment that we wish to penetrate deeper\ninto the psychic processes of the dream all paths lead into darkness. It\nis quite impossible to explain the dream as a psychic process, for to\nexplain means to trace to the known, and as yet we do not possess any\npsychological knowledge under which we can range what may be inferred\nfrom our psychological investigation of dreams as their fundamental\nexplanation. On the contrary, we shall be compelled to build a series of\nnew assumptions concerning the structure of the psychic apparatus and\nits active forces; and this we shall have to be careful not to carry\nbeyond the simplest logical concatenation, as its value may otherwise\nmerge into uncertainty. And, even if we should make no mistake in our\nconclusions, and take cognisance of all the logical possibilities\ninvolved, we shall still be threatened with complete failure in our\nsolution through the probable incompleteness of our elemental data. It\nwill also be impossible to gain, or at least to establish, an\nexplanation for the construction and workings of the psychic instrument\neven through a most careful investigation of the dream or any other\n_single_ activity. On the contrary, it will be necessary for this end to\nbring together whatever appears decisively as constant after a\ncomparative study of a whole series of psychic activities. Thus the\npsychological conceptions which we shall gain from an analysis of the\ndream process will have to wait, as it were, at the junction point until\nthey can be connected with the results of other investigations which may\nhave advanced to the nucleus of the same problem from another starting\npoint.\n(_a_) _Forgetting in Dreams._\nI propose, then, first, to turn to a subject which has given rise to an\nobjection hitherto unnoticed, threatening to undermine the foundation of\nour work in dream interpretation. It has been objected in more than one\nquarter that the dream which we wish to interpret is really unknown to\nus, or, to be more precise, that we have no assurance of knowing it as\nit has really occurred (see p. 37). What we recollect of the dream, and\nwhat we subject to our methods of interpretation, is in the first place\ndisfigured through our treacherous memory, which seems particularly\nunfitted to retain the dream, and which may have omitted precisely the\nmost important part of the dream content. For, when we pay attention to\nour dreams, we often find cause to complain that we have dreamed much\nmore than we remember; that, unfortunately, we know nothing more than\nthis one fragment, and that even this seems to us peculiarly uncertain.\nOn the other hand, everything assures us that our memory reproduces the\ndream not only fragmentarily but also delusively and falsely. Just as on\nthe one hand we may doubt whether the material dreamt was really as\ndisconnected and confused as we remember it, so on the other hand may we\ndoubt whether a dream was as connected as we relate it; whether in the\nattempt at reproduction we have not filled in the gaps existing or\ncaused by forgetfulness with new material arbitrarily chosen; whether we\nhave not embellished, rounded off, and prepared the dream so that all\njudgment as to its real content becomes impossible. Indeed, one author\n(Spitta[64]) has expressed his belief that all that is orderly and\nconnected is really first put into the dream during our attempt to\nrecall it. Thus we are in danger of having wrested from our hands the\nvery subject whose value we have undertaken to determine.\nIn our dream interpretations we have thus far ignored these warnings.\nIndeed, the demand for interpretation was, on the contrary, found to be\nno less perceptible in the smallest, most insignificant, and most\nuncertain ingredients of the dream content than in those containing the\ndistinct and definite parts. In the dream of Irma\u2019s injection we read,\n\u201cI quickly called in Dr. M.,\u201d and we assumed that even this small\naddendum would not have gotten into the dream if it had not had a\nspecial derivation. Thus we reached the history of that unfortunate\npatient to whose bed I \u201cquickly\u201d called in the older colleague. In the\napparently absurd dream which treated the difference between 51 and 56\nas _quantit\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9_, the number 51 was repeatedly mentioned. Instead\nof finding this self-evident or indifferent, we inferred from it a\nsecond train of thought in the latent content of the dream which led to\nthe number 51. By following up this clue we came to the fears which\nplaced 51 years as a limit of life, this being in most marked contrast\nto a dominant train of thought which boastfully knew no limit to life.\nIn the dream \u201cNon Vixit\u201d I found, as an insignificant interposition that\nI at first overlooked, the sentence, \u201cAs P. does not understand him, Fl.\nasks me,\u201d &c. The interpretation then coming to a standstill, I returned\nto these words, and found through them the way to the infantile\nphantasy, which appeared in the dream thoughts as an intermediary point\nof junction. This came about by means of the poet\u2019s verses:\nSeldom have you understood me,\nSeldom have I understood you,\nBut when we got into the mire,\nWe at once understood each other.\nEvery analysis will demonstrate by examples how the most insignificant\nfeatures of the dream are indispensable to the analysis, and how the\nfinishing of the task is delayed by the fact that attention is not at\nfirst directed to them. In the same way we have in the interpretation of\ndreams respected every nuance of verbal expression found in the dream;\nindeed, if we were confronted by a senseless or insufficient wording\nbetraying an unsuccessful effort to translate the dream in the proper\nstyle, we have even respected these defects of expression. In brief,\nwhat the authorities have considered arbitrary improvisation, concocted\nhastily to suit the occasion, we have treated like a sacred text. This\ncontradiction requires an explanation.\nIt is in our favour, without disparagement to the authorities. From the\nviewpoint of our newly-acquired understanding concerning the origin of\nthe dream, the contradictions fall into perfect agreement. It is true\nthat we distort the dream in our attempt to reproduce it; and herein we\nfind another instance of what we have designated as the often\nmisunderstood secondary elaboration of the dream through the influence\nof normal thinking. But this distortion is itself only a part of the\nelaboration to which the dream thoughts are regularly subjected by\nvirtue of the dream censor. The authorities have here divined or\nobserved that part of the dream distortion most obviously at work; to us\nthis is of little importance, for we know that a more prolific work of\ndistortion, not so easily comprehensible, has already chosen the dream\nfrom among the concealed thoughts as its object. The authorities err\nonly in considering the modifications of the dream while it is being\nrecalled and put in words as arbitrary and insoluble; and hence, as\nlikely to mislead us in the interpretation of the dream. We\nover-estimate the determination of the psychic. There is nothing\narbitrary in this field. It can quite generally be shown that a second\ntrain of thought immediately undertakes the determination of the\nelements which have been left undetermined by the first. I wish, _e.g._,\nto think quite voluntarily of a number. This, however, is impossible.\nThe number that occurs to me is definitely and necessarily determined by\nthoughts within me which may be far from my momentary intention.[FJ]\nJust as far from arbitrary are the modifications which the dream\nexperiences through the revision of the waking state. They remain in\nassociative connection with the content, the place of which they take,\nand serve to show us the way to this content, which may itself be the\nsubstitute for another.\nIn the analysis of dreams with patients I am accustomed to institute the\nfollowing proof of this assertion, which has never proved unsuccessful.\nIf the report of a dream appears to me at first difficult to understand,\nI request the dreamer to repeat it. This he rarely does in the same\nwords. The passages wherein the expression is changed have become known\nto me as the weak points of the dream\u2019s disguise, which are of the same\nservice to me as the embroidered mark on Siegfried\u2019s raiment was to\nHagen. The analysis may start from these points. The narrator has been\nadmonished by my announcement that I mean to take special pains to solve\nthe dream, and immediately, under the impulse of resistance, he protects\nthe weak points of the dream\u2019s disguise, replacing the treacherous\nexpressions by remoter ones. He thus calls my attention to the\nexpressions he has dropped. From the efforts made to guard against the\nsolution of the dream, I can also draw conclusions as to the care with\nwhich the dream\u2019s raiment was woven.\nThe authors are, however, less justified in giving so much importance to\nthe doubt which our judgment encounters in relating the dream. It is\ntrue that this doubt betrays the lack of an intellectual assurance, but\nour memory really knows no guarantees, and yet, much more often than is\nobjectively justified, we yield to the pressure of lending credence to\nits statements. The doubt concerning the correct representation of the\ndream, or of its individual data, is again only an offshoot of the dream\ncensor\u2014that is, of the resistance against penetration to consciousness\nof the dream thoughts. This resistance has not entirely exhausted itself\nin bringing about the displacements and substitutions, and it therefore\nadheres as doubt to what has been allowed to pass through. We can\nrecognise this doubt all the easier through the fact that it takes care\nnot to attack the intensive elements of the dream, but only the weak and\nindistinct ones. For we already know that a transvaluation of all the\npsychic values has taken place between the dream thoughts and the dream.\nThe disfigurement has been made possible only by the alteration of\nvalues; it regularly manifests itself in this way and occasionally\ncontents itself with this. If doubt attaches to an indistinct element of\nthe dream content, we may, following the hint, recognise in this element\na direct offshoot of one of the outlawed dream thoughts. It is here just\nas it was after a great revolution in one of the republics of antiquity\nor of the Renaissance. The former noble and powerful ruling families are\nnow banished; all high positions are filled by upstarts; in the city\nitself only the very poor and powerless citizens or the distant\nfollowers of the vanquished party are tolerated. Even they do not enjoy\nthe full rights of citizenship. They are suspiciously watched. Instead\nof the suspicion in the comparison, we have in our case the doubt. I\ntherefore insist that in the analysis of dreams one should emancipate\none\u2019s self from the entire conception of estimating trustworthiness, and\nwhen there is the slightest possibility that this or that occurred in\nthe dream, it should be treated as a full certainty. Until one has\ndecided to reject these considerations in tracing the dream elements,\nthe analysis will remain at a standstill. Antipathy toward the element\nconcerned shows its psychic effect in the person analysed by the fact\nthat the undesirable idea will evoke no thought in his mind. Such effect\nis really not self-evident. It would not be inconsistent if one would\nsay: \u201cWhether this or that was contained in the dream I do not know, but\nthe following thoughts occur to me in this direction.\u201d But he never\nexpresses himself thus; and it is just this disturbing influence of\ndoubt in the analysis that stamps it as an offshoot and instrument of\nthe psychic resistance. Psychoanalysis is justly suspicious. One of its\nrules reads: _Whatever disturbs the continuation of the work is a\nresistance._\nThe forgetting of dreams, too, remains unfathomable as long as we do not\nconsider the force of the psychic censor in its explanation. The\nfeeling, indeed, that one has dreamt a great deal during the night and\nhas retained only a little of it may have another meaning in a number of\ncases. It may perhaps signify that the dream-work has continued\nperceptibly throughout the night, and has left behind only this short\ndream. There is, however, no doubt of the fact that the dream is\nprogressively forgotten on awakening. One often forgets it in spite of\npainful effort to remember. I believe, however, that just as one\ngenerally over-estimates the extent of one\u2019s forgetting, so also one\nover-estimates the deficiencies in one\u2019s knowledge, judging them by the\ngaps occurring in the dream. All that has been lost through forgetting\nin a dream content can often be brought back through analysis. At least,\nin a whole series of cases, it is possible to discover from one single\nremaining fragment, not the dream, to be sure, which is of little\nimportance, but all the thoughts of the dream. It requires a greater\nexpenditure of attention and self-control in the analysis; that is all.\nBut, at the same time, this suggests that the forgetting of the dream\ndoes not lack a hostile intention.\nA convincing proof of the purposeful nature of dream-forgetting, in the\nservice of resistance, is gained in analysis through the investigation\nof a preliminary stage of forgetting.[FK] It often happens that in the\nmidst of interpretation work an omitted fragment of the dream suddenly\ncomes to the surface. This part of the dream snatched from forgetfulness\nis always the most important part. It lies on the shortest road toward\nthe solution of the dream, and for that very reason it was most\nobjectionable to the resistance. Among the examples of dreams that I\nhave collected in connection with this treatise, it once happened that I\nhad to interpose subsequently such a piece of dream content. It was a\ntravelling dream, which took vengeance upon an unlovable female\ntravelling companion; I have left it almost entirely uninterpreted on\naccount of its being in part coarse and nasty. The part omitted read: \u201cI\nsaid about a book by Schiller, \u2018It is from \u2014\u2014\u2019 but corrected myself, for\nI noticed the mistake myself, \u2018It is by.\u2019 Upon this the man remarked to\nhis sister, \u2018Indeed, he said it correctly.\u2019\u201d\nThe self-correction in dreams, which seems so wonderful to some authors,\ndoes not merit consideration by us. I shall rather show from my own\nmemory the model for the grammatical error in the dream. I was nineteen\nyears old when I visited England for the first time, and spent a day on\nthe shore of the Irish Sea. I naturally amused myself by catching the\nsea animals left by the waves, and occupied myself in particular with a\nstarfish (the dream begins with Hollthurn\u2014Holothurian), when a pretty\nlittle girl came over to me and asked me, \u201cIs it a starfish? Is it\nalive?\u201d I answered, \u201cYes, he is alive,\u201d but was then ashamed of my\nmistake and repeated the sentence correctly. For the grammatical mistake\nwhich I then made, the dream substitutes another which is quite common\nwith Germans. \u201cDas Buch ist von Schiller\u201d should not be translated by\n_the book is from_, but _the book is by_. That the dream-work produces\nthis substitution because the word _from_ makes possible, through\nconsonance, a remarkable condensation with the German adjective _fromm_\n(pious, devout), no longer surprises us after all that we have heard\nabout the aims of the dream-work and about its reckless selection of\nmeans of procedure. But what is the meaning of the harmless recollection\nof the seashore in relation to the dream? It explains by means of a very\ninnocent example that I have used the wrong gender\u2014_i.e._ that I have\nput \u201che,\u201d the word denoting the sex or the sexual, where it does not\nbelong. This is surely one of the keys to the solution of dreams. Who\never has heard of the origin of the book-title _Matter and Motion_\n(Moli\u00e8re in _Malade Imaginaire_: La mati\u00e8re est-elle laudable?\u2014A motion\nof the bowels) will readily be able to supply the missing parts.\nMoreover, I can prove conclusively by a _demonstratio ad oculos_ that\nthe forgetting in dreams is in great part due to the activity of\nresistance. A patient tells me that he has dreamed, but that the dream\nhas vanished without leaving a trace, as if nothing had happened. We\ncontinue to work, however; I strike a resistance which I make plain to\nthe patient; by encouraging and urging I help him to become reconciled\nto some disagreeable thought; and as soon as I have succeeded he\nexclaims, \u201cNow, I can recall what I have dreamed.\u201d The same resistance\nwhich that day disturbed him in the work caused him also to forget the\ndream. By overcoming this resistance, I brought the dream to memory.\nIn the same way the patient may, on reaching a certain part of the work,\nrecall a dream which took place three, four, or more days before, and\nwhich has rested in oblivion throughout all this time.\nPsychoanalytic experience has furnished us with another proof of the\nfact that the forgetting of dreams depends more on the resistance than\non the strangeness existing between the waking and sleeping states, as\nthe authorities have believed. It often happens to me, as well as to the\nother analysts and to patients under treatment, that we are awakened\nfrom sleep by a dream, as we would say, and immediately thereafter,\nwhile in full possession of our mental activity, we begin to interpret\nthe dream. In such cases I have often not rested until I gained a full\nunderstanding of the dream, and still it would happen that after the\nawakening I have just as completely forgotten the interpretation work as\nthe dream content itself, though I was aware that I had dreamed and that\nI had interpreted the dream. The dream has more frequently taken along\ninto forgetfulness the result of the interpretation work than it was\npossible for the mental activity to retain the dream in memory. But\nbetween this interpretation work and the waking thoughts there is not\nthat psychic gap through which alone the authorities wish to explain the\nforgetting of dreams. Morton Prince objects to my explanation of the\nforgetting of dreams on the ground that it is only a particular example\nof amnesia for dissociated states, and that the impossibility of\nharmonising my theory with other types of amnesia makes it also\nvalueless for other purposes. He thus makes the reader suspect that in\nall his description of such dissociated states he has never made the\nattempt to find the dynamic explanation for these phenomena. For, had he\ndone so, he surely would have discovered that the repression and the\nresistance produced thereby \u201cis quite as well the cause of this\ndissociation as of the amnesia for its psychic content.\u201d\nThat the dream is as little forgotten as the other psychic acts, and\nthat it clings to memory just as firmly as the other psychic activities\nwas demonstrated to me by an experiment which I was able to make while\ncompiling this manuscript. I have kept in my notes many dreams of my own\nwhich, for some reason at the time I could analyse only imperfectly or\nnot at all. In order to get material to illustrate my assertions, I\nattempted to subject some of them to analysis from one to two years\nlater. I succeeded in this attempt without any exception. Indeed, I may\neven state that the interpretation went more easily at this later time\nthan at the time when the dreams were recent occurrences. As a possible\nexplanation for this fact, I would say that I had gotten over some of\nthe resistances which disturbed me at the time of dreaming. In such\nsubsequent interpretations I have compared the past results in dream\nthoughts with the present, which have usually been more abundant, and\nhave invariably found the past results falling under the present without\nchange. I have, however, soon put an end to my surprise by recalling\nthat I have long been accustomed to interpret dreams from former years\nwhich have occasionally been related to me by patients as if they were\ndreams of the night before, with the same method and the same success. I\nshall report two examples of such delayed dream interpretations in the\ndiscussion of anxiety dreams. When I instituted this experiment for the\nfirst time, I justly expected that the dream would behave in this\nrespect like a neurotic symptom. For when I treat a neurotic, perhaps an\nhysteric, by psychoanalysis, I am compelled to find explanations for the\nfirst symptoms of the disease which have long been forgotten, just as\nfor those still existing which have brought the patient to me; and I\nfind the former problem easier to solve than the more exigent one of\nto-day. In the _Studien \u00fcber Hysterie_, published as early as 1895, I\nwas able to report the explanation of a first hysterical attack of\nanxiety which the patient, a woman over forty years of age, had\nexperienced in her fifteenth year.[FL]\nI may now proceed in an informal way to some further observations on the\ninterpretation of dreams, which will perhaps be of service to the reader\nwho wishes to test my assertion by the analysis of his own dreams.\nNo one must expect that the interpretations of his dreams will come to\nhim overnight without any exertion. Practice is required even for the\nperception of endoptic phenomena and other sensations usually withdrawn\nfrom attention, although this group of perceptions is not opposed by any\npsychic motive. It is considerably more difficult to become master of\nthe \u201cundesirable presentations.\u201d He who wishes to do this will have to\nfulfil the requirements laid down in this treatise. Obeying the rules\nhere given, he will strive during the work to curb in himself every\ncritique, every prejudice, and every affective or intellectual\none-sidedness. We will always be mindful of the precept of Claude\nBernard for the experimenter in the physiological laboratory\u2014\u201cTravailler\ncomme une b\u00eate\u201d\u2014meaning he should be just as persistent, but also just\nas unconcerned about the results. He who will follow these counsels will\nsurely no longer find the task difficult. The interpretation of a dream\ncannot always be accomplished in one session; you often feel, after\nfollowing up a concatenation of thoughts, that your working capacity is\nexhausted; the dream will not tell you anything more on that day; it is\nthen best to break off, and return to the work the following day.\nAnother portion of the dream content then solicits your attention, and\nyou thus find an opening to a new stratum of the dream thoughts. We may\ncall this the \u201cfractionary\u201d interpretation of dreams.\nIt is most difficult to induce the beginner in the interpretation of\ndreams to recognise the fact that his task is not finished though he is\nin possession of a complete interpretation of the dream which is\ningenious and connected, and which explains all the elements of the\ndream. Besides this another superimposed interpretation of the same\ndream may be possible which has escaped him. It is really not simple to\nform an idea of the abundant unconscious streams of thought striving for\nexpression in our minds, and to believe in the skilfulness displayed by\nthe dream-work in hitting, so to speak, with its ambiguous manner of\nexpression, seven flies with one stroke, like the journeyman tailor in\nthe fairy tale. The reader will constantly be inclined to reproach the\nauthor for uselessly squandering his ingenuity, but anyone who has had\nexperience of his own will learn to know better.\nThe question whether every dream can be interpreted may be answered in\nthe negative. One must not forget that in the work of interpretation one\nmust cope with the psychic forces which are responsible for the\ndistortion of the dream. Whether one can become master of the inner\nresistances through his intellectual interest, his capacity for\nself-control, his psychological knowledge, and his practice in dream\ninterpretation becomes a question of the preponderance of forces. It is\nalways possible to make some progress. One can at least go far enough to\nbecome convinced that the dream is an ingenious construction, generally\nfar enough to gain an idea of its meaning. It happens very often that a\nsecond dream confirms and continues the interpretation assumed for the\nfirst. A whole series of dreams running for weeks or months rests on a\ncommon basis, and is therefore to be interpreted in connection. In\ndreams following each other, it may be often observed how one takes as\nits central point what is indicated only as the periphery of the next,\nor it is just the other way, so that the two supplement each other in\ninterpretation. That the different dreams of the same night are quite\nregularly in the interpretation to be treated as a whole I have already\nshown by examples.\nIn the best interpreted dreams we must often leave one portion in\nobscurity because we observe in the interpretation that it represents\nthe beginning of a tangle of dream thoughts which cannot be unravelled\nbut which has furnished no new contribution to the dream content. This,\nthen, is the keystone of the dream, the place at which it mounts into\nthe unknown. For the dream thoughts which we come upon in the\ninterpretation must generally remain without a termination, and merge in\nall directions into the net-like entanglement of our world of thoughts.\nIt is from some denser portion of this texture that the dream-wish then\narises like the mushroom from its mycelium.\nLet us now return to the facts of dream-forgetting, as we have really\nneglected to draw an important conclusion from them. If the waking life\nshows an unmistakable intention to forget the dream formed at night,\neither as a whole, immediately after awakening, or in fragments during\nthe course of the day, and if we recognise as the chief participator in\nthis forgetting the psychic resistance against the dream which has\nalready performed its part in opposing the dream at night\u2014then the\nquestion arises, What has the dream formation actually accomplished\nagainst this resistance? Let us consider the most striking case in which\nthe waking life has done away with the dream as though it had never\nhappened. If we take into consideration the play of the psychic forces,\nwe are forced to assert that the dream would have never come into\nexistence had the resistance held sway during the night as during the\nday. We conclude then, that the resistance loses a part of its force\nduring the night; we know that it has not been extinguished, as we have\ndemonstrated its interest in the dream formation in the production of\nthe distortion. We have, then, forced upon us the possibility that it\nabates at night, that the dream formation has become possible with this\ndiminution of the resistance, and we thus readily understand that,\nhaving regained its full power with the awakening, it immediately sets\naside what it was forced to admit as long as it was in abeyance.\nDescriptive psychology teaches us that the chief determinant in dream\nformation is the dormant state of the mind. We may now add the following\nelucidation: _The sleeping state makes dream formation possible by\ndiminishing the endopsychic censor._\nWe are certainly tempted to look upon this conclusion as the only one\npossible from the facts of dream-forgetting, and to develop from it\nfurther deductions concerning the proportions of energy in the sleeping\nand waking states. But we shall stop here for the present. When we have\npenetrated somewhat deeper into the psychology of the dream we shall\nfind that the origin of the dream formation may be differently\nconceived. The resistance operating to prevent the dream thoughts coming\nto consciousness may perhaps be eluded without suffering diminution _per\nse_. It is also plausible that both the factors favourable to dream\nformation, the diminution as well as the eluding of the resistance, may\nbe made possible simultaneously through the sleeping state. But we shall\npause here, and continue this line of thought later.\nThere is another series of objections against our procedure in the dream\ninterpretation which we must now consider. In this interpretation we\nproceed by dropping all the end-presentations which otherwise control\nreflection, we direct our attention to an individual element of the\ndream, and then note the unwished-for thoughts that occur to us in this\nconnection. We then take up the next component of the dream content, and\nrepeat the operation with it; and, without caring in what direction the\nthoughts take us, we allow ourselves to be led on by them until we end\nby rambling from one subject to another. At the same time, we harbour\nthe confident hope that we may in the end, without effort, come upon the\ndream thoughts from which our dream originated. Against this the critic\nbrings the following objection: That one can arrive somewhere, starting\nfrom a single element in the dream is nothing wonderful. Something can\nbe associatively connected with every idea. It is remarkable only that\none should succeed in hitting the dream thoughts in this aimless and\narbitrary excursion of thought. It is probably a self-deception; the\ninvestigator follows the chain of association from one element until for\nsome reason it is seen to break, when a second element is taken up; it\nis thus but natural that the association, originally unbounded, should\nnow experience a narrowing. He keeps in mind the former chain of\nassociations, and he will therefore in analysis more easily hit upon\ncertain thoughts which have something in common with the thoughts from\nthe first chain. He then imagines that he has found a thought which\nrepresents a point of junction between two elements of the dream. As he,\nmoreover, allows himself every freedom of thought connection, excepting\nonly the transitions from one idea to another which are made in normal\nthinking, it is not finally difficult for him to concoct something which\nhe calls the dream thought out of a series of \u201cintermediary thoughts\u201d;\nand without any guarantee, as they are otherwise unknown, he palms these\noff as the psychic equivalent of the dream. But all this is accompanied\nby arbitrary procedure and over-ingenious exploitation of coincidence.\nAnyone who will go to this useless trouble can in this way work out any\ndesired interpretation for any dream whatever.\nIf such objections are really advanced against us, we may refer in our\ndefence to the agreement of our dream interpretations, to the surprising\nconnections with other dream elements which appear in following out the\ndifferent particular presentations, and to the improbability that\nanything which so perfectly covers and explains the dream as our dream\ninterpretations do could be gained otherwise than by following psychic\nconnections previously established. We can also justify ourselves by the\nfact that the method of dream analysis is identical with the method used\nin the solution of hysterical symptoms, where the correctness of the\nmethod is attested through the emergence and fading away of the\nsymptoms\u2014that is, where the elucidation of the text by the interposed\nillustrations finds corroboration. But we have no object in avoiding\nthis problem\u2014how one can reach to a pre-established aim by following a\nchain of thoughts spun out thus arbitrarily and aimlessly\u2014for, though we\nare unable to solve the problem, we can get rid of it entirely.\nIt is in fact demonstrably incorrect to state that we abandon ourselves\nto an aimless course of thought when, as in the interpretation of\ndreams, we relinquish our reflection and allow the unwished-for idea to\ncome to the surface. It can be shown that we can reject only those\nend-presentations that are familiar to us, and that as soon as these\nstop the unknown, or, as we say more precisely, the unconscious\nend-presentations, immediately come into play, which now determined the\ncourse of the unwished-for presentations. A mode of thinking without\nend-idea can surely not be brought about through any influence we can\nexert on our own mental life; nor do I know either of any state of\npsychic derangement in which such mode of thought establishes itself.\nThe psychiatrists have in this field much too early rejected the\nsolidity of the psychic structure. I have ascertained that an\nunregulated stream of thoughts, devoid of the end-presentation, occurs\nas little in the realm of hysteria and paranoia as in the formation or\nsolution of dreams. Perhaps it does not appear at all in the endogenous\npsychic affections, but even the deliria of confused states are senseful\naccording to the ingenious theory of Leuret and become incomprehensible\nto us only through omissions. I have come to the same conviction\nwherever I have found opportunity for observation. The deliria are the\nwork of a censor which no longer makes any effort to conceal its sway,\nwhich, instead of lending its support to a revision no longer obnoxious\nto it, cancels regardlessly that which it raises objections against,\nthus causing the remnant to appear disconnected. This censor behaves\nanalogously to the Russian newspaper censor on the frontier, who allows\nto fall into the hands of his protected readers only those foreign\njournals that have passed under the black pencil.\nThe free play of the presentations following any associative\nconcatenation perhaps makes its appearance in destructive organic brain\nlesions. What, however, is taken as such in the psychoneuroses can\nalways be explained as the influence of the censor on a series of\nthoughts which have been pushed into the foreground by the concealed\nend-presentation.[FM] It has been considered an unmistakable sign of\nassociation free from the end-presentations when the emerging\npresentations (or pictures) were connected with one another by means of\nthe so-called superficial associations\u2014that is, by assonance, word\nambiguity, and causal connection without inner sense relationship; in\nother words, when they were connected through all those associations\nwhich we allow ourselves to make use of in wit and play upon words. This\ndistinguishing mark proves true for the connections of thought which\nlead us from the elements of the dream content to the collaterals, and\nfrom these to the thoughts of the dream proper; of this we have in our\ndream analysis found many surprising examples. No connection was there\ntoo loose and no wit too objectionable to serve as a bridge from one\nthought to another. But the correct understanding of such tolerance is\nnot remote. _Whenever one psychic element is connected with another\nthrough an obnoxious or superficial association, there also exists a\ncorrect and more profound connection between the two which succumbs to\nthe resistance of the censor._\nThe correct explanation for the predominance of the superficial\nassociations is the pressure of the censor, and not the suppression of\nthe end-presentations. The superficial associations supplant the deep\nones in the presentation whenever the censor renders the normal\nconnective paths impassable. It is as if in a mountainous region a\ngeneral interruption of traffic, _e.g._, an inundation, should render\nimpassable the long and broad thoroughfares; traffic would then have to\nbe maintained through inconvenient and steep footpaths otherwise used\nonly by the hunter.\nWe can here distinguish two cases which, however, are essentially one.\nIn the first case the censor is directed only against the connection of\nthe two thoughts, which, having been detached from each other, escape\nthe opposition. The two thoughts then enter successively into\nconsciousness; their connection remains concealed; but in its place\nthere occurs to us a superficial connection between the two which we\nwould not otherwise have thought of, and which as a rule connects with\nanother angle of the presentation complex instead of with the one giving\nrise to the suppressed but essential connection. Or, in the second case,\nboth thoughts on account of their content succumb to the censor; both\nthen appear not in their correct but in a modified substituted form; and\nboth substituted thoughts are so selected that they represent, through a\nsuperficial association, the essential relation which existed between\nthose which have been replaced by them. Under the pressure of the censor\nthe displacement of a normal and vital association by a superficial and\napparently absurd one has thus occurred in both cases.\nBecause we know of this displacement we unhesitatingly place reliance\neven upon superficial associations in the dream analysis.[FN]\nThe psychoanalysis of neurotics makes prolific use of the two axioms,\nfirst that with the abandonment of the conscious end-presentation the\ndomination of the train of presentation is transferred to the concealed\nend-presentations; and, secondly, that superficial associations are only\na substitutive displacement for suppressed and more profound ones;\nindeed, psychoanalysis raises these two axioms to pillars of its\ntechnique. When I request a patient to dismiss all reflection, and to\nreport to me whatever comes into his mind, I firmly cling to the\npresupposition that he will not be able to drop the end-idea of the\ntreatment, and I feel justified in concluding that what he reports, even\nthough seemingly most harmless and arbitrary, has connection with this\nmorbid state. My own personality is another end-presentation concerning\nwhich the patient has no inkling. The full appreciation, as well as the\ndetailed proof of both these explanations, belongs accordingly to the\ndescription of the psychoanalytic technique as a therapeutic method. We\nhave here reached one of the allied subjects with which we propose to\nleave the subject of the interpretation of dreams.[FO]\nOf all the objections only one is correct, and still remains, namely,\nthat we ought not to ascribe all mental occurrences of the\ninterpretation work to the nocturnal dream-work. In the interpretation\nin the waking state we are making a road running from the dream elements\nback to the dream thoughts. The dream-work has made its way in the\nopposite direction, and it is not at all probable that these roads are\nequally passable in the opposite directions. It has, on the contrary,\nbeen shown that during the day, by means of new thought connections we\nmake paths which strike the intermediate thoughts and the dream thoughts\nin different places. We can see how the recent thought material of the\nday takes its place in the groups of the interpretation, and probably\nalso forces the additional resistance appearing through the night to\nmake new and further detours. But the number and form of the collaterals\nwhich we thus spin during the day is psychologically perfectly\nnegligible if it only leads the way to the desired dream thoughts.\n(_b_) _Regression._\nNow that we have guarded against objection, or at least indicated where\nour weapons for defence rest, we need no longer delay entering upon the\npsychological investigations for which we have so long prepared. Let us\nbring together the main results of our investigations up to this point.\nThe dream is a momentous psychic act; its motive power is at all times\nto fulfil a wish; its indiscernibleness as a wish and its many\npeculiarities and absurdities are due to the influence of the psychic\ncensor to which it has been subjected during its formation. Apart from\nthe pressure to withdraw itself from this censor, the following have\nplayed a part in its formation: a strong tendency to the condensation of\npsychic material, a consideration for dramatisation into mental\npictures, and (though not regularly) a consideration for a rational and\nintelligible exterior in the dream structure. From every one of these\npropositions the road leads further to psychological postulates and\nassumptions. Thus the reciprocal relation of the wish motives and the\nfour conditions, as well as the relations of these conditions to one\nanother will have to be investigated; and the dream will have to be\nbrought into association with the psychic life.\nAt the beginning of this chapter we cited a dream in order to remind us\nof the riddles that are still unsolved. The interpretation of this dream\nof the burning child afforded us no difficulties, although it was not\nperfectly given in our present sense. We asked ourselves why it was\nnecessary, after all, that the father should dream instead of awakening,\nand we recognised the wish to represent the child as living as the\nsingle motive of the dream. That there was still another wish playing a\npart in this connection, we shall be able to show after later\ndiscussions. For the present, therefore, we may say that for the sake of\nthe wish-fulfilment the mental process of sleep was transformed into a\ndream.\nIf the wish realisation is made retrogressive, only one quality still\nremains which separates the two forms of psychic occurrences from each\nother. The dream thought might have read: \u201cI see a glimmer coming from\nthe room in which the corpse reposes. Perhaps a candle has been upset,\nand the child is burning!\u201d The dream reports the result of this\nreflection unchanged, but represents it in a situation which takes place\nin the present, and which is conceivable by the senses like an\nexperience in the waking state. This, however, is the most common and\nthe most striking psychological character of the dream; a thought,\nusually the one wished for, is in the dream made objective and\nrepresented as a scene, or, according to our belief, as experienced.\nBut how are we now to explain this characteristic peculiarity of the\ndream-work, or, to speak more modestly, how are we to bring it into\nrelation with the psychic processes?\nOn closer examination, it is plainly seen that there are two pronounced\ncharacters in the manifestations of the dream which are almost\nindependent of each other. The one is the representation as a present\nsituation with the omission of the \u201cperhaps\u201d; the other is the\ntransformation of the thought into visual pictures and into speech.\nThe transformation in the dream thoughts, which shifts into the present\nthe expectation expressed in them, is perhaps in this particular dream\nnot so very striking. This is probably in consonance with the special or\nrather subsidiary r\u00f4le of the wish-fulfilment in this dream. Let us take\nanother dream in which the dream-wish does not separate itself in sleep\nfrom a continuation of the waking thoughts, _e.g._, the dream of Irma\u2019s\ninjection. Here the dream thought reaching representation is in the\noptative, \u201cIf Otto could only be blamed for Irma\u2019s sickness!\u201d The dream\nsuppresses the optative, and replaces it by a simple present, \u201cYes, Otto\nis to blame for Irma\u2019s sickness.\u201d This is therefore the first of the\nchanges which even the undistorted dream undertakes with the dream\nthought. But we shall not stop long at this first peculiarity of the\ndream. We elucidate it by a reference to the conscious phantasy, the day\ndream, which behaves similarly with its presentation content. When\nDaudet\u2019s Mr. Joyeuse wanders through the streets of Paris unemployed\nwhile his daughter is led to believe that he has a position and is in\nhis office, he likewise dreams in the present of circumstances that\nmight help him to obtain protection and a position. The dream therefore\nemploys the present in the same manner and with the same right as the\nday dream. The present is the tense in which the wish is represented as\nfulfilled.\nThe second quality, however, is peculiar to the dream as distinguished\nfrom the day dream, namely, that the presentation content is not\nthought, but changed into perceptible images to which we give credence\nand which we believe we experience. Let us add, however, that not all\ndreams show this transformation of presentation into perceptible images.\nThere are dreams which consist solely of thoughts to which we cannot,\nhowever, on that account deny the substantiality of dreams. My dream\n\u201cAutodidasker\u2014the waking phantasy with Professor N.\u201d\u2014is of that nature;\nit contains hardly more perceptible elements than if I had thought its\ncontent during the day. Moreover, every long dream contains elements\nwhich have not experienced the transformation into the perceptible, and\nwhich are simply thought or known as we are wont to think or know in our\nwaking state. We may also recall here that such transformation of ideas\ninto perceptible images does not occur in dreams only but also in\nhallucinations and visions which perhaps appear spontaneously in health\nor as symptoms in the psychoneuroses. In brief, the relation which we\nare investigating here is in no way an exclusive one; the fact remains,\nhowever, that where this character of the dream occurs, it appears to us\nas the most noteworthy, so that we cannot think of it apart from the\ndream life. Its explanation, however, requires a very detailed\ndiscussion.\nAmong all the observations on the theory of dreams to be found in\nauthorities on the subject, I should like to lay stress upon one as\nbeing worth mentioning. The great G. T. Fechner[35] expresses his belief\n(_Psychophysik_, Part II., p. 520), in connection with some discussion\ndevoted to the dream, that the seat of the dream is elsewhere than in\nthe waking ideation. No other theory enables us to conceive the special\nqualities of the dream life.\nThe idea which is placed at our disposal is one of psychic locality. We\nshall entirely ignore the fact that the psychic apparatus with which we\nare here dealing is also familiar to us as an anatomical specimen, and\nwe shall carefully avoid the temptation to determine the psychic\nlocality in any way anatomically. We shall remain on psychological\nground, and we shall think ourselves called upon only to conceive the\ninstrument which serves the psychic activities somewhat after the manner\nof a compound microscope, a photographic or other similar apparatus. The\npsychic locality, then, corresponds to a place within such an apparatus\nin which one of the primary elements of the picture comes into\nexistence. As is well known, there are in the microscope and telescope\npartly fanciful locations or regions in which no tangible portion of the\napparatus is located. I think it superfluous to apologise for the\nimperfections of this and all similar figures. These comparisons are\ndesigned only to assist us in our attempt to make clear the complication\nof the psychic activity by breaking up this activity and referring the\nsingle activities to the single component parts of the apparatus. No\none, so far as I know, has ever ventured to attempt to discover the\ncomposition of the psychic instrument through such analysis. I see no\nharm in such an attempt. I believe that we may give free rein to our\nassumptions provided we at the same time preserve our cool judgment and\ndo not take the scaffolding for the building. As we need nothing except\nauxiliary ideas for the first approach to any unknown subject, we shall\nprefer the crudest and most tangible hypothesis to all others.\nWe therefore conceive the psychic apparatus as a compound instrument,\nthe component parts of which let us call instances, or, for the sake of\nclearness, systems. We then entertain the expectation that these systems\nperhaps maintain a constant spatial relationship to each other like the\ndifferent systems of lenses of the telescope, one behind another.\nStrictly speaking, there is no need of assuming a real spatial\narrangement of the psychic system. It will serve our purpose if a firm\nsequence be established through the fact that in certain psychological\noccurrences the system will be traversed by the excitement in a definite\nchronological order. This sequence may experience an alteration in other\nprocesses; such possibility may be left open. For the sake of brevity,\nwe shall henceforth speak of the component parts of the apparatus as\n\u201c\u03a8-systems.\u201d\nThe first thing that strikes us is the fact that the apparatus composed\nof \u03a8-systems has a direction. All our psychic activities proceed from\n(inner or outer) stimuli and terminate in innervations. We thus ascribe\nto the apparatus a sensible and a motor end; at the sensible end we find\na system which receives the perceptions, and at the motor end another\nwhich opens the locks of motility. The psychic process generally takes\nits course from the perception end to the motility end. The most common\nscheme of the psychic apparatus has therefore the following appearance:\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\nBut this is only in compliance with the demand long familiar to us, that\nthe psychic apparatus must be constructed like a reflex apparatus. The\nreflex act remains the model for every psychic activity.\nWe have now reason to admit a first differentiation at the sensible end.\nThe perceptions that come to us leave a trace in our psychic apparatus\nwhich we may call a \u201cMemory trace.\u201d The function which relates to this\nmemory trace we call the memory. If we hold seriously to our resolution\nto connect the psychic processes into systems, the memory trace can then\nconsist only of lasting changes in the elements of the systems. But, as\nhas already been shown in other places, obvious difficulties arise if\none and the same system faithfully preserves changes in its elements and\nstill remains fresh and capable of admitting new motives for change.\nFollowing the principle which directs our undertaking, we shall\ndistribute these two activities among two different systems. We assume\nthat a first system of the apparatus takes up the stimuli of perception,\nbut retains nothing from them\u2014that is, it has no memory; and that behind\nthis there lies a second system which transforms the momentary\nexcitement of the first into lasting traces. This would then be a\ndiagram of our psychic apparatus:\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\nIt is known that from the perceptions that act on the P-system we retain\nsomething else as lasting as the content itself. Our perceptions prove\nto be connected with one another in memory, and this is especially the\ncase when they have once fallen together in simultaneity. We call this\nthe fact of association. It is now clear that if the P-system is\nentirely lacking in memory, it certainly cannot preserve traces for the\nassociations; the individual P-elements would be intolerably hindered in\ntheir function if a remnant of former connection should make its\ninfluence felt against a new perception. Hence we must, on the contrary,\nassume that the memory system is the basis of the association. The fact\nof the association, then, consists in this\u2014that, in consequence of the\ndiminutions in resistance and a smoothing of the ways from one of the\nMem-elements, the excitement transmits itself to a second rather than to\na third Mem-system.\nOn further investigation we find it necessary to assume not one but many\nsuch Mem-systems, in which the same excitement propagated by the\nP-elements experiences a diversified fixation. The first of these\nMem-systems will contain in any case the fixation of the association\nthrough simultaneity, while in those lying further away the same\nexciting material will be arranged according to other forms of\nconcurrence; so that relationships of similarity, &c., might perhaps be\nrepresented through these later systems. It would naturally be idle to\nattempt to report in words the psychic significance of such a system.\nIts characteristic would lie in the intimacy of its relations to\nelements of raw memory material\u2014that is, if we wish to point to a\nprofounder theory in the gradations of the resistances to conduction\ntoward these elements.\nWe may insert here an observation of a general nature which points\nperhaps to something of importance. The P-system, which possesses no\ncapability of preserving changes and hence no memory, furnishes for our\nconsciousness the entire manifoldness of the sensible qualities. Our\nmemories, on the other hand, are unconscious in themselves; those that\nare most deeply impressed form no exception. They can be made conscious,\nbut there can be no doubt that they develop all their influences in the\nunconscious state. What we term our character is based, to be sure, on\nthe memory traces of our impressions, and indeed on these impressions\nthat have affected us most strongly, those of our early youth\u2014those that\nalmost never become conscious. But when memories become conscious again\nthey show no sensible quality or a very slight one in comparison to the\nperceptions. If, now, it can be confirmed _that memory and quality\nexclude each other, as far as consciousness in the \u03a8-systems is\nconcerned_, a most promising insight reveals itself to us in the\ndeterminations of the neuron excitement.\nWhat we have so far assumed concerning the composition of the psychic\napparatus at the sensible end follows regardless of the dream and the\npsychological explanations derived from it. The dream, however, serves\nas a source of proof for the knowledge of another part of the apparatus.\nWe have seen that it became impossible to explain the dream formation\nunless we ventured to assume two psychic instances, one of which\nsubjected the activity of the other to a critique as a consequence of\nwhich the exclusion from consciousness resulted.\nWe have seen that the criticising instance entertains closer relations\nwith consciousness than the criticised. The former stands between the\nlatter and consciousness like a screen. We have, moreover, found\nessential reasons for identifying the criticising instance with that\nwhich directs our waking life and determines our voluntary conscious\nactions. If we now replace these instances in the development of our\ntheory by systems, the criticising system is then to be ascribed to the\nmotor end because of the fact just mentioned. We now enter both systems\nin our scheme, and express by the names given them their relation to\nconsciousness.\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\nThe last of the systems at the motor end we call the foreconscious in\norder to denote that exciting processes in this system can reach\nconsciousness without any further detention provided certain other\nconditions be fulfilled, _e.g._, the attainment of a certain intensity,\na certain distribution of that function which must be called attention,\nand the like. This is at the same time the system which possesses the\nkeys to voluntary motility. The system behind it we call the unconscious\nbecause it has no access to consciousness except through the\nforeconscious, in the passage through which its excitement must submit\nto certain changes.\nIn which of these systems, now, do we localise the impulse to the dream\nformation? For the Sake of simplicity, let us say in the system Unc. To\nbe sure we shall find in later discussions that this is not quite\ncorrect, that the dream formation is forced to connect with dream\nthoughts which belong to the system of the foreconscious. But we shall\nlearn later, when we come to deal with the dream-wish, that the motive\npower for the dream is furnished by the Unc., and, owing to this latter\nmovement, we shall assume the unconscious system as the starting-point\nof the dream formation. This dream impulse, like all other thought\nstructures, will now strive to continue itself in the foreconscious, and\nthence to gain admission to consciousness.\nExperience teaches us that the road leading from the foreconscious to\nconsciousness is closed to the dream thoughts during the day by the\nresistance of the censor. At night the dream thoughts gain admission to\nconsciousness, but the question arises, in what way and because of what\nchange. If this admission was rendered possible to the dream thoughts\nthrough the fact that the resistance watching on the boundary between\nthe unconscious and foreconscious sinks at night, we should then get\ndreams in the material of our presentations which did not show the\nhallucinatory character which just now interests us.\nThe sinking of the censor between the two systems, Unc. and Forec., can\nexplain to us only such dreams as \u201cAutodidasker,\u201d but not dreams like\nthe one of the burning child, which we have taken as a problem at the\noutset in these present investigations.\nWhat takes place in the hallucinatory dream we can describe in no other\nway than by saying that the excitement takes a retrogressive course. It\ntakes its station, not at the motor end of the apparatus, but at the\nsensible end, and finally reaches the system of the perceptions. If we\ncall the direction towards which the psychic process continues from the\nunconscious into the waking state the progressive, we may then speak of\nthe dream as having a regressive character.\nThis regression is surely one of the most important peculiarities of the\ndream process; but we must not forget that it does not belong to the\ndream alone. The intentional recollection and other processes of our\nnormal thinking also require a retrogression in the psychic apparatus\nfrom any complex presentation act to the raw material of the memory\ntraces lying at its basis. But during the waking state this turning\nbackward does not reach beyond the memory pictures; it is unable to\nproduce the hallucinatory vividness of the perception pictures. Why is\nthis different in the dream? When we spoke of the condensation work of\nthe dream we could not avoid the assumption that the intensities\nadhering to the presentations are fully transferred from one to another\nthrough the dream-work. It is probably this modification of the former\npsychic process which makes possible the occupation of the system of P\nto its full sensual vividness in the opposite direction from thought.\nI hope that we are far from deluding ourselves about the importance of\nthis present discussion. We have done nothing more than give a name to\nan inexplicable phenomenon. We call it regression if the presentation in\nthe dream is changed back to the perceptible image from which it once\noriginated. But even this step demands justification. Why this naming,\nif it does not teach us anything new? I believe, however, that the name\n\u201cRegression\u201d will serve us to the extent of connecting a fact familiar\nto us with a scheme of the psychic apparatus which is supplied with a\ndirection. At this point, for the first time, it is worth the trouble to\nconstruct such a scheme. For, with the help of this scheme, any other\npeculiarity of the dream formation will become clear to us without\nfurther reflection. If we look upon the dream as a process of regression\nin the assumed psychic apparatus, we can readily understand the\nempirically proven fact that all mental relation of the dream thoughts\neither is lost in the dream-work or can come to expression only with\ndifficulty. According to our scheme, these mental relations are\ncontained not in the first Mem-systems, but in those lying further to\nthe front, and in the regression they must forfeit their expression in\nfavour of the perception pictures. _The structure of the dream thoughts\nis in the regression broken up into its raw material._\nBut what change renders possible this regression which is impossible\nduring the day? Let us here be content with assumption. There must\nevidently be some alterations in the charge of energy belonging to the\nsingle systems causing the latter to become accessible or inaccessible\nto the discharge of the excitement; but in any such apparatus the same\neffect upon the course of excitement might be brought about through more\nthan one form of such changes. This naturally reminds us of the state of\nsleep and of the many changes of energy this state produces at the\nsensible end of the apparatus. During the day there is a continuous\ncoursing stream from the \u03a8-system of the P toward the motility; this\ncurrent ceases at night, and no longer hinders a streaming of the\ncurrent of excitement in the opposite direction. This would appear to be\nthat \u201cseclusion from the outer world\u201d which according to the theory of\nsome authors is supposed to explain the psychological character of the\ndream (_vide_ p. 30). In the explanation of the regression of the dream\nwe shall, however, have to consider those other regressions which\noriginate during morbid waking states. In these other forms the\nexplanation just given plainly leaves us in the lurch. Regression takes\nplace in spite of the uninterrupted sensible current in a progressive\ndirection.\nThe hallucinations of hysteria and paranoia, as well as the visions of\nmentally normal persons, I can explain as actually corresponding to\nregressions, being in fact thoughts transformed into images; and only\nsuch thoughts are subjected to this transformation as are in intimate\nconnection with suppressed or unconscious recollections. As an example I\nshall cite one of my youngest hysterical patients\u2014a boy, twelve years\nold, who was prevented from falling asleep by \u201c_green faces with red\neyes_,\u201d which terrified him. The source of this manifestation was the\nsuppressed, but once conscious, memory of a boy whom he had often seen\nduring four years, and who offered him a deterring example of many\nchildish bad habits, including onanism, which now formed the subject of\nhis own reproach. His mother had noticed at the time that the complexion\nof the ill-bred boy was greenish and that he had _red_ (_i.e. red\nbordered_) _eyes_. Hence the terrible vision which constantly served to\nremind him of his mother\u2019s warning that such boys become demented, that\nthey are unable to make progress at school, and are doomed to an early\ndeath. A part of this prediction came true in the case of the little\npatient; he could not successfully pursue his high school studies, and,\nas appeared on examination of his involuntary fancies, he stood in great\ndread of the remainder of the prophecy. However, after a brief period of\nsuccessful treatment, his sleep was restored, he lost his fears, and\nfinished his scholastic year with an excellent record.\nI may also add here the interpretation of a vision related to me by an\nhysteric forty years of age, as having occurred in her normal life. On\nopening her eyes one morning she beheld in the room her brother, whom\nshe knew to be confined in an insane asylum. Her little son was asleep\nby her side. Lest the child should be frightened on seeing his uncle,\nand fall into convulsions, she pulled the sheet over the little one;\nthis done, the phantom disappeared. This vision is the re-casting of one\nof her infantile reminiscences which, although conscious, is most\nintimately connected with all the unconscious material in her mind. Her\nnursemaid told her that her mother, who had died young (the patient was\nthen only a year and a half old), had suffered from epileptic or\nhysterical convulsions, which dated back to a fright caused by her\nbrother (the patient\u2019s uncle), who appeared to her disguised as a\nspectre with a sheet over his head. The vision contains the same\nelements as the reminiscence, viz. the appearance of the brother, the\nsheet, the fright, and its effect. These elements, however, are ranged\nin different relations, and are transferred to other persons. The\nobvious motive of the vision, which replaces the idea, is her solicitude\nlest her little son, who bore a striking resemblance to his uncle,\nshould share the latter\u2019s fate. Both examples here cited are not\nentirely unrelated to sleep, and may therefore be unsuitable as proof\nfor my assertion. I may therefore refer to my analysis of an\nhallucinatory paranoia,[FP] and to the results of my hitherto\nunpublished studies on the psychology of the psychoneuroses in order to\nemphasize the fact that in these cases of regressive thought\ntransformation one must not overlook the influence of a suppressed or\nunconscious reminiscence, this being in most cases of an infantile\ncharacter. This recollection, so to speak, draws into the regression the\nthought with which it is connected, which is prevented from expression\nby the censor\u2014that is, into that form of representation in which the\nrecollection itself exists psychically. I may here mention as a result\nof my studies in hysteria that if we succeed in restoring infantile\nscenes to consciousness (whether recollections or fancies) they are seen\nas hallucinations, and are divested of this character only after\nreproduction. It is also known that the earliest infantile memories\nretain the character of perceptible vividness until late in life, even\nin persons who are otherwise not visual in memory.\nIf, now, we keep in mind what part is played in the dream thoughts by\nthe infantile reminiscences or the phantasies based upon them, how often\nfragments of these reminiscences emerge in the dream content, and how\noften they even give origin to dream wishes, we cannot deny the\nprobability that in the dream, too, the transformation of thoughts into\nvisual images may be the result of the attraction exerted by the\nvisually represented reminiscences, striving for reanimation, upon the\nthoughts severed from consciousness and struggling for expression.\nFollowing this conception, we may further describe the dream as a\nmodified substitute for the infantile scene produced by transference to\nrecent material. The infantile cannot enforce its renewal, and must\ntherefore be satisfied to return as a dream.\nThis reference to the significance of the infantile scenes (or of their\nphantastic repetitions), as in a manner furnishing the pattern for the\ndream content, renders superfluous the assumption made by Scherner and\nhis pupils, of an inner source of excitement. Scherner assumes a state\nof \u201cvisual excitation\u201d of internal excitement in the organ of sight when\nthe dreams manifest a particular vividness or a special abundance of\nvisual elements. We need not object to this assumption, but may be\nsatisfied with establishing such state of excitation for the psychic\nperceptive system of the organs of vision only; we shall, however,\nassert that this state of excitation is formed through the memory, and\nis merely a refreshing of the former actual visual excitation. I cannot,\nfrom my own experience, give a good example showing such an influence of\ninfantile reminiscence; my own dreams are surely less rich in\nperceptible elements than I must fancy those of others; but in my most\nbeautiful and most vivid dream of late years I can easily trace the\nhallucinatory distinctness of the dream contents to the sensuous nature\nof recently received impressions. On page 368 I mentioned a dream in\nwhich the dark blue colour of the water, the brown colour of the smoke\nissuing from the ship\u2019s funnels, and the sombre brown and red of the\nbuildings which I had seen made a profound and lasting impression on my\nmind. This dream, if any, must be attributed to visual excitation. But\nwhat has brought my visual organ into this excitable state? It was a\nrecent impression uniting itself with a series of former ones. The\ncolours I beheld were those of the toy blocks with which my children\nerected a grand structure for my admiration on the day preceding the\ndream. The same sombre red colour covered the large blocks and the same\nblue and brown the small ones. Connected with these were the colour\nimpression of my last journey in Italy, the charming blue of the Isonzo\nand the Lagoon, the brown hue of the Alpine region. The beautiful\ncolours seen in the dream were but a repetition of those seen in the\nmemory.\nLet us review what we have learned about this peculiarity which the\ndream has of transforming its content of ideas into plastic images. We\nhave neither explained this character of the dream-work nor traced it to\nknown laws of psychology, but we have singled it out as pointing to\nunknown connections, and designated it by the name of the \u201cregredient\u201d\ncharacter. Wherever this regression has occurred, we have regarded it as\nan effect of the resistance which opposes the progress of the thought on\nits normal way to consciousness, as well as a result of the simultaneous\nattraction exerted upon it by the vivid memories present. Regression is\nperhaps facilitated in the dream by the cessation of the progressive\nstream running from the sense organs during the day. For this auxiliary\nmoment there must be compensation in the other forms of regression\nthrough a fortifying of the other motives of regression. We must also\nbear in mind that in pathological cases of regression, as in the dream,\nthe process of transference of energy must be different from that of the\nregressions of normal psychic life, as it renders possible a full\nhallucinatory occupation of the perception systems. What we have\ndescribed in the analysis of the dream-work as \u201cRegard for Dramatic\nFitness\u201d may be referred to the selective attraction of visually\nrecollected scenes, touched by the dream thoughts.\nIt is quite possible that this first part of our psychological\nutilisation of the dream does not entirely satisfy even us. We must,\nhowever, console ourselves with the fact that we are compelled to build\nin the dark. If we have not altogether strayed from the right path, we\nshall be sure to reach about the same ground from another\nstarting-point, and thereafter perhaps be better able to see our way.\n(_c_) _The Wish-Fulfilment._\nThe dream of the burning child cited above affords us a welcome\nopportunity for appreciating the difficulties confronting the theory of\nwish-fulfilment. That the dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfilment\nsurely seemed strange to us all\u2014and that not alone because of the\ncontradictions offered by the anxiety dream.\nAfter learning from the first analytical explanations that the dream\nconceals sense and psychic validity, we could hardly expect so simple a\ndetermination of this sense. According to the correct but concise\ndefinition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation of thinking in\nsleep (in so far as one sleeps). Considering that during the day our\nthoughts produce such a diversity of psychic acts\u2014judgments,\nconclusions, contradictions, expectations, intentions, &c.\u2014why should\nour sleeping thoughts be forced to confine themselves to the production\nof wishes? Are there not, on the contrary, many dreams that present a\ndifferent psychic act in dream form, _e.g._, a solicitude, and is not\nthe very transparent father\u2019s dream mentioned above of just such a\nnature? From the gleam of light falling into his eyes while asleep the\nfather draws the solicitous conclusion that a candle has been upset and\nmay have set fire to the corpse; he transforms this conclusion into a\ndream by investing it with a senseful situation enacted in the present\ntense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfilment, and\nwhich are we to suspect\u2014the predominance of the thought continued from\nthe waking state or of the thought incited by the new sensory\nimpression?\nAll these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply\ninto the part played by the wish-fulfilment in the dream, and into the\nsignificance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.\nIt is in fact the wish-fulfilment that has already induced us to\nseparate dreams into two groups. We have found some dreams that were\nplainly wish-fulfilments; and others in which wish-fulfilment could not\nbe recognised, and was frequently concealed by every available means. In\nthis latter class of dreams we recognised the influence of the dream\ncensor. The undisguised wish dreams were chiefly found in children, yet\nfleeting open-hearted wish dreams _seemed_ (I purposely emphasize this\nword) to occur also in adults.\nWe may now ask whence the wish fulfilled in the dream originates. But to\nwhat opposition or to what diversity do we refer this \u201cwhence\u201d? I think\nit is to the opposition between conscious daily life and a psychic\nactivity remaining unconscious which can only make itself noticeable\nduring the night. I thus find a threefold possibility for the origin of\na wish. Firstly, it may have been incited during the day, and owing to\nexternal circumstances failed to find gratification, there is thus left\nfor the night an acknowledged but unfulfilled wish. Secondly, it may\ncome to the surface during the day but be rejected, leaving an\nunfulfilled but suppressed wish. Or, thirdly, it may have no relation to\ndaily life, and belong to those wishes that originate during the night\nfrom the suppression. If we now follow our scheme of the psychic\napparatus, we can localise a wish of the first order in the system\nForec. We may assume that a wish of the second order has been forced\nback from the Forec. system into the Unc. system, where alone, if\nanywhere, it can maintain itself; while a wish-feeling of the third\norder we consider altogether incapable of leaving the Unc. system. This\nbrings up the question whether wishes arising from these different\nsources possess the same value for the dream, and whether they have the\nsame power to incite a dream.\nOn reviewing the dreams which we have at our disposal for answering this\nquestion, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of the\ndream-wish the actual wish incitements arising during the night, such as\nthirst and sexual desire. It then becomes evident that the source of the\ndream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream. This view is\nsupported by the dream of the little girl who continued the sea trip\ninterrupted during the day, and by the other children\u2019s dreams referred\nto; they are explained by an unfulfilled but not suppressed wish from\nthe day-time. That a wish suppressed during the day asserts itself in\nthe dream can be shown by a great many examples. I shall mention a very\nsimple example of this class. A somewhat sarcastic young lady, whose\nyounger friend has become engaged to be married, is asked throughout the\nday by her acquaintances whether she knows and what she thinks of the\nfianc\u00e9. She answers with unqualified praise, thereby silencing her own\njudgment, as she would prefer to tell the truth, namely, that he is an\nordinary person (Dutzendmensch).[FQ] The following night she dreams that\nthe same question is put to her, and that she replies with the formula:\n\u201cIn case of subsequent orders it will suffice to mention the number.\u201d\nFinally, we have learned from numerous analyses that the wish in all\ndreams that have been subject to distortion has been derived from the\nunconscious, and has been unable to come to perception in the waking\nstate. Thus it would appear that all wishes are of the same value and\nforce for the dream formation.\nI am at present unable to prove that the state of affairs is really\ndifferent, but I am strongly inclined to assume a more stringent\ndetermination of the dream-wish. Children\u2019s dreams leave no doubt that\nan unfulfilled wish of the day may be the instigator of the dream. But\nwe must not forget that it is, after all, the wish of a child, that it\nis a wish-feeling of infantile strength only. I have a strong doubt\nwhether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream\nin an adult. It would rather seem that as we learn to control our\nimpulses by intellectual activity, we more and more reject as vain the\nformation or retention of such intense wishes as are natural to\nchildhood. In this, indeed, there may be individual variations; some\nretain the infantile type of psychic processes longer than others. The\ndifferences are here the same as those found in the gradual decline of\nthe originally distinct visual imagination.\nIn general, however, I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of the\nday are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I readily admit that\nthe wish instigators originating in conscious life contribute towards\nthe incitement of dreams, but that is probably all. The dream would not\noriginate if the foreconscious wish were not reinforced from another\nsource.\nThat source is the unconscious. I believe that _the conscious wish is a\ndream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish\nwhich reinforces it_. Following the suggestions obtained through the\npsychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious wishes\nare always active and ready for expression whenever they find an\nopportunity to unite themselves with an emotion from conscious life, and\nthat they transfer their greater intensity to the lesser intensity of\nthe latter.[FR] It may therefore seem that the conscious wish alone has\nbeen realised in a dream; but a slight peculiarity in the formation of\nthis dream will put us on the track of the powerful helper from the\nunconscious. These ever active and, as it were, immortal wishes from the\nunconscious recall the legendary Titans who from time immemorial have\nborne the ponderous mountains which were once rolled upon them by the\nvictorious gods, and which even now quiver from time to time from the\nconvulsions of their mighty limbs; I say that these wishes found in the\nrepression are of themselves of an infantile origin, as we have learned\nfrom the psychological investigation of the neuroses. I should like,\ntherefore, to withdraw the opinion previously expressed that it is\nunimportant whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another,\nas follows: _The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one._\nIn the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where no\nseparation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or where\nthese are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled and\nunrepressed wish from the waking state. I am aware that this conception\ncannot be generally demonstrated, but I maintain nevertheless that it\ncan be frequently demonstrated, even where it was not suspected, and\nthat it cannot be generally refuted.\nThe wish-feelings which remain from the conscious waking state are,\ntherefore, relegated to the background in the dream formation. In the\ndream content I shall attribute to them only the part attributed to the\nmaterial of actual sensations during sleep (see p. 185). If I now take\ninto account those other psychic instigations remaining from the waking\nstate which are not wishes, I shall only adhere to the line mapped out\nfor me by this train of thought. We may succeed in provisionally\nterminating the sum of energy of our waking thoughts by deciding to go\nto sleep. He is a good sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I. is reputed\nto have been a model of this sort. But we do not always succeed in\naccomplishing it, or in accomplishing it perfectly. Unsolved problems,\nharassing cares, overwhelming impressions continue the thinking activity\neven during sleep, maintaining psychic processes in the system which we\nhave termed the foreconscious. These mental processes continuing into\nsleep may be divided into the following groups: 1, That which has not\nbeen terminated during the day owing to casual prevention; 2, that which\nhas been left unfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power,\n_i.e._ the unsolved; 3, that which has been rejected and suppressed\nduring the day. This unites with a powerful group (4) formed by that\nwhich has been excited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the\nforeconscious. Finally, we may add group (5) consisting of the\nindifferent and hence unsettled impressions of the day.\nWe should not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep by\nthese remnants of waking life, especially those emanating from the group\nof the unsolved. These excitations surely continue to strive for\nexpression during the night, and we may assume with equal certainty that\nthe sleeping state renders impossible the usual continuation of the\nexcitement in the foreconscious and the termination of the excitement by\nits becoming conscious. As far as we can normally become conscious of\nour mental processes, even during the night, in so far we are not\nasleep. I shall not venture to state what change is produced in the\nForec. system by the sleeping state, but there is no doubt that the\npsychological character of sleep is essentially due to the change of\nenergy in this very system, which also dominates the approach to\nmotility, which is paralysed during sleep. In contradistinction to this,\nthere seems to be nothing in the psychology of the dream to warrant the\nassumption that sleep produces any but secondary changes in the\nconditions of the Unc. system. Hence, for the nocturnal excitation in\nthe Forec. there remains no other path than that followed by the wish\nexcitements from the Unc. This excitation must seek reinforcement from\nthe Unc., and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. But\nwhat is the relation of the foreconscious day remnants to the dream?\nThere is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream, that\nthey utilise the dream content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness\neven during the night; indeed, they occasionally even dominate the dream\ncontent, and impel it to continue the work of the day; it is also\ncertain that the day remnants may just as well have any other character\nas that of wishes; but it is highly instructive and even decisive for\nthe theory of wish-fulfilment to see what conditions they must comply\nwith in order to be received into the dream.\nLet us pick out one of the dreams cited above as examples, _e.g._, the\ndream in which my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow\u2019s\ndisease (p. 228). My friend Otto\u2019s appearance occasioned me some concern\nduring the day, and this worry, like everything else referring to this\nperson, affected me. I may also assume that these feelings followed me\ninto sleep. I was probably bent on finding out what was the matter with\nhim. In the night my worry found expression in the dream which I have\nreported, the content of which was not only senseless, but failed to\nshow any wish-fulfilment. But I began to investigate for the source of\nthis incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during the day, and\nanalysis revealed the connection. I identified my friend Otto with a\ncertain Baron L. and myself with a Professor R. There was only one\nexplanation for my being impelled to select just this substitution for\nthe day thought. I must have always been prepared in the Unc. to\nidentify myself with Professor R., as it meant the realisation of one of\nthe immortal infantile wishes, viz. that of becoming great. Repulsive\nideas respecting my friend, that would certainly have been repudiated in\na waking state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into the\ndream, but the worry of the day likewise found some form of expression\nthrough a substitution in the dream content. The day thought, which was\nno wish in itself but rather a worry, had in some way to find a\nconnection with the infantile now unconscious and suppressed wish, which\nthen allowed it, though already properly prepared, to \u201coriginate\u201d for\nconsciousness. The more dominating this worry, the stronger must be the\nconnection to be established; between the contents of the wish and that\nof the worry there need be no connection, nor was there one in any of\nour examples.\nWe can now sharply define the significance of the unconscious wish for\nthe dream. It may be admitted that there is a whole class of dreams in\nwhich the incitement originates preponderatingly or even exclusively\nfrom the remnants of daily life; and I believe that even my cherished\ndesire to become at some future time a \u201cprofessor extraordinarius\u201d would\nhave allowed me to slumber undisturbed that night had not my worry about\nmy friend\u2019s health been still active. But this worry alone would not\nhave produced a dream; the motive power needed by the dream had to be\ncontributed by a wish, and it was the affair of the worriment to procure\nfor itself such wish as a motive power of the dream. To speak\nfiguratively, it is quite possible that a day thought plays the part of\nthe contractor (_entrepreneur_) in the dream. But it is known that no\nmatter what idea the contractor may have in mind, and how desirous he\nmay be of putting it into operation, he can do nothing without capital;\nhe must depend upon a capitalist to defray the necessary expenses, and\nthis capitalist, who supplies the psychic expenditure for the dream is\ninvariably and indisputably _a wish from the unconscious_, no matter\nwhat the nature of the waking thought may be.\nIn other cases the capitalist himself is the contractor for the dream;\nthis, indeed, seems to be the more usual case. An unconscious wish is\nproduced by the day\u2019s work, which in turn creates the dream. The dream\nprocesses, moreover, run parallel with all the other possibilities of\nthe economic relationship used here as an illustration. Thus, the\nentrepreneur may contribute some capital himself, or several\nentrepreneurs may seek the aid of the same capitalist, or several\ncapitalists may jointly supply the capital required by the entrepreneur.\nThus there are dreams produced by more than one dream-wish, and many\nsimilar variations which may readily be passed over and are of no\nfurther interest to us. What we have left unfinished in this discussion\nof the dream-wish we shall be able to develop later.\nThe \u201ctertium comparationis\u201d in the comparisons just employed\u2014_i.e._ the\nsum placed at our free disposal in proper allotment\u2014admits of still\nfiner application for the illustration of the dream structure. As shown\non p. 285 we can recognise in most dreams a centre especially supplied\nwith perceptible intensity. This is regularly the direct representation\nof the wish-fulfilment; for, if we undo the displacements of the\ndream-work by a process of retrogression, we find that the psychic\nintensity of the elements in the dream thoughts is replaced by the\nperceptible intensity of the elements in the dream content. The elements\nadjoining the wish-fulfilment have frequently nothing to do with its\nsense, but prove to be descendants of painful thoughts which oppose the\nwish. But, owing to their frequently artificial connection with the\ncentral element, they have acquired sufficient intensity to enable them\nto come to expression. Thus, the force of expression of the\nwish-fulfilment is diffused over a certain sphere of association, within\nwhich it raises to expression all elements, including those that are in\nthemselves impotent. In dreams having several strong wishes we can\nreadily separate from one another the spheres of the individual\nwish-fulfilments; the gaps in the dream likewise can often be explained\nas boundary zones.\nAlthough the foregoing remarks have considerably limited the\nsignificance of the day remnants for the dream, it will nevertheless be\nworth our while to give them some attention. For they must be a\nnecessary ingredient in the formation of the dream, inasmuch as\nexperience reveals the surprising fact that every dream shows in its\ncontent a connection with some impression of a recent day, often of the\nmost indifferent kind. So far we have failed to see any necessity for\nthis addition to the dream mixture (p. 153). This necessity appears only\nwhen we follow closely the part played by the unconscious wish, and then\nseek information in the psychology of the neuroses. We thus learn that\nthe unconscious idea, as such, is altogether incapable of entering into\nthe foreconscious, and that it can exert an influence there only by\nuniting with a harmless idea already belonging to the foreconscious, to\nwhich it transfers its intensity and under which it allows itself to be\nconcealed. This is the fact of transference which furnishes an\nexplanation for so many surprising occurrences in the psychic life of\nneurotics.\nThe idea from the foreconscious which thus obtains an unmerited\nabundance of intensity may be left unchanged by the transference, or it\nmay have forced upon it a modification from the content of the\ntransferring idea. I trust the reader will pardon my fondness for\ncomparisons from daily life, but I feel tempted to say that the\nrelations existing for the repressed idea are similar to the situations\nexisting in Austria for the American dentist, who is forbidden to\npractise unless he gets permission from a regular physician to use his\nname on the public signboard and thus cover the legal requirements.\nMoreover, just as it is naturally not the busiest physicians who form\nsuch alliances with dental practitioners, so in the psychic life only\nsuch foreconscious or conscious ideas are chosen to cover a repressed\nidea as have not themselves attracted much of the attention which is\noperative in the foreconscious. The unconscious entangles with its\nconnections preferentially either those impressions and ideas of the\nforeconscious which have been left unnoticed as indifferent, or those\nthat have soon been deprived of this attention through rejection. It is\na familiar fact from the association studies confirmed by every\nexperience, that ideas which have formed intimate connections in one\ndirection assume an almost negative attitude to whole groups of new\nconnections. I once tried from this principle to develop a theory for\nhysterical paralysis.\nIf we assume that the same need for the transference of the repressed\nideas which we have learned to know from the analysis of the neuroses\nmakes its influence felt in the dream as well, we can at once explain\ntwo riddles of the dream, viz. that every dream analysis shows an\ninterweaving of a recent impression, and that this recent element is\nfrequently of the most indifferent character. We may add what we have\nalready learned elsewhere, that these recent and indifferent elements\ncome so frequently into the dream content as a substitute for the most\ndeep-lying of the dream thoughts, for the further reason that they have\nleast to fear from the resisting censor. But while this freedom from\ncensorship explains only the preference for trivial elements, the\nconstant presence of recent elements points to the fact that there is a\nneed for transference. Both groups of impressions satisfy the demand of\nthe repression for material still free from associations, the\nindifferent ones because they have offered no inducement for extensive\nassociations, and the recent ones because they have had insufficient\ntime to form such associations.\nWe thus see that the day remnants, among which we may now include the\nindifferent impressions when they participate in the dream formation,\nnot only borrow from the Unc. the motive power at the disposal of the\nrepressed wish, but also offer to the unconscious something\nindispensable, namely, the attachment necessary to the transference. If\nwe here attempted to penetrate more deeply into the psychic processes,\nwe should first have to throw more light on the play of emotions between\nthe foreconscious and the unconscious, to which, indeed, we are urged by\nthe study of the psychoneuroses, whereas the dream itself offers no\nassistance in this respect.\nJust one further remark about the day remnants. There is no doubt that\nthey are the actual disturbers of sleep, and not the dream, which, on\nthe contrary, strives to guard sleep. But we shall return to this point\nlater.\nWe have so far discussed the dream-wish, we have traced it to the sphere\nof the Unc., and analysed its relations to the day remnants, which in\nturn may be either wishes, psychic emotions of any other kind, or simply\nrecent impressions. We have thus made room for any claims that may be\nmade for the importance of conscious thought activity in dream\nformations in all its variations. Relying upon our thought series, it\nwould not be at all impossible for us to explain even those extreme\ncases in which the dream as a continuer of the day work brings to a\nhappy conclusion an unsolved problem of the waking state. We do not,\nhowever, possess an example, the analysis of which might reveal the\ninfantile or repressed wish source furnishing such alliance and\nsuccessful strengthening of the efforts of the foreconscious activity.\nBut we have not come one step nearer a solution of the riddle: Why can\nthe unconscious furnish the motive power for the wish-fulfilment only\nduring sleep? The answer to this question must throw light on the\npsychic nature of wishes; and it will be given with the aid of the\ndiagram of the psychic apparatus.\nWe do not doubt that even this apparatus attained its present perfection\nthrough a long course of development. Let us attempt to restore it as it\nexisted in an early phase of its activity. From assumptions, to be\nconfirmed elsewhere, we know that at first the apparatus strove to keep\nas free from excitement as possible, and in its first formation,\ntherefore, the scheme took the form of a reflex apparatus, which enabled\nit promptly to discharge through the motor tracts any sensible stimulus\nreaching it from without. But this simple function was disturbed by the\nwants of life, which likewise furnish the impulse for the further\ndevelopment of the apparatus. The wants of life first manifested\nthemselves to it in the form of the great physical needs. The excitement\naroused by the inner want seeks an outlet in motility, which may be\ndesignated as \u201cinner changes\u201d or as an \u201cexpression of the emotions.\u201d The\nhungry child cries or fidgets helplessly, but its situation remains\nunchanged; for the excitation proceeding from an inner want requires,\nnot a momentary outbreak, but a force working continuously. A change can\noccur only if in some way a feeling of gratification is\nexperienced\u2014which in the case of the child must be through outside\nhelp\u2014in order to remove the inner excitement. An essential constituent\nof this experience is the appearance of a certain perception (of food in\nour example), the memory picture of which thereafter remains associated\nwith the memory trace of the excitation of want.\nThanks to the established connection, there results at the next\nappearance of this want a psychic feeling which revives the memory\npicture of the former perception, and thus recalls the former perception\nitself, _i.e._ it actually re-establishes the situation of the first\ngratification. We call such a feeling a wish; the reappearance of the\nperception constitutes the wish-fulfilment, and the full revival of the\nperception by the want excitement constitutes the shortest road to the\nwish-fulfilment. We may assume a primitive condition of the psychic\napparatus in which this road is really followed, _i.e._ where the\nwishing merges into an hallucination. This first psychic activity\ntherefore aims at an identity of perception, _i.e._ it aims at a\nrepetition of that perception which is connected with the fulfilment of\nthe want.\nThis primitive mental activity must have been modified by bitter\npractical experience into a more expedient secondary activity. The\nestablishment of the identity perception on the short regressive road\nwithin the apparatus does not in another respect carry with it the\nresult which inevitably follows the revival of the same perception from\nwithout. The gratification does not take place, and the want continues.\nIn order to equalise the internal with the external sum of energy, the\nformer must be continually maintained, just as actually happens in the\nhallucinatory psychoses and in the deliriums of hunger which exhaust\ntheir psychic capacity in clinging to the object desired. In order to\nmake more appropriate use of the psychic force, it becomes necessary to\ninhibit the full regression so as to prevent it from extending beyond\nthe image of memory, whence it can select other paths leading ultimately\nto the establishment of the desired identity from the outer world. This\ninhibition and consequent deviation from the excitation becomes the task\nof a second system which dominates the voluntary motility, _i.e._\nthrough whose activity the expenditure of motility is now devoted to\npreviously recalled purposes. But this entire complicated mental\nactivity which works its way from the memory picture to the\nestablishment of the perception identity from the outer world merely\nrepresents a detour which has been forced upon the wish-fulfilment by\nexperience.[FS] Thinking is indeed nothing but the equivalent of the\nhallucinatory wish; and if the dream be called a wish-fulfilment this\nbecomes self-evident, as nothing but a wish can impel our psychic\napparatus to activity. The dream, which in fulfilling its wishes follows\nthe short regressive path, thereby preserves for us only an example of\nthe primary form of the psychic apparatus which has been abandoned as\ninexpedient. What once ruled in the waking state when the psychic life\nwas still young and unfit seems to have been banished into the sleeping\nstate, just as we see again in the nursery the bow and arrow, the\ndiscarded primitive weapons of grown-up humanity. _The dream is a\nfragment of the abandoned psychic life of the child._ In the psychoses\nthese modes of operation of the psychic apparatus, which are normally\nsuppressed in the waking state, reassert themselves, and then betray\ntheir inability to satisfy our wants in the outer world.\nThe unconscious wish-feelings evidently strive to assert themselves\nduring the day also, and the fact of transference and the psychoses\nteach us that they endeavour to penetrate to consciousness and dominate\nmotility by the road leading through the system of the foreconscious. It\nis, therefore, the censor lying between the Unc. and the Forec., the\nassumption of which is forced upon us by the dream, that we have to\nrecognise and honour as the guardian of our psychic health. But is it\nnot carelessness on the part of this guardian to diminish its vigilance\nduring the night and to allow the suppressed emotions of the Unc. to\ncome to expression, thus again making possible the hallucinatory\nregression? I think not, for when the critical guardian goes to rest\u2014and\nwe have proof that his slumber is not profound\u2014he takes care to close\nthe gate to motility. No matter what feelings from the otherwise\ninhibited Unc. may roam about on the scene, they need not be interfered\nwith; they remain harmless because they are unable to put in motion the\nmotor apparatus which alone can exert a modifying influence upon the\nouter world. Sleep guarantees the security of the fortress which is\nunder guard. Conditions are less harmless when a displacement of forces\nis produced, not through a nocturnal diminution in the operation of the\ncritical censor, but through pathological enfeeblement of the latter or\nthrough pathological reinforcement of the unconscious excitations, and\nthis while the foreconscious is charged with energy and the avenues to\nmotility are open. The guardian is then overpowered, the unconscious\nexcitations subdue the Forec.; through it they dominate our speech and\nactions, or they enforce the hallucinatory regression, thus governing an\napparatus not designed for them by virtue of the attraction exerted by\nthe perceptions on the distribution of our psychic energy. We call this\ncondition a psychosis.\nWe are now in the best position to complete our psychological\nconstruction, which has been interrupted by the introduction of the two\nsystems, Unc. and Forec. We have still, however, ample reason for giving\nfurther consideration to the wish as the sole psychic motive power in\nthe dream. We have explained that the reason why the dream is in every\ncase a wish realisation is because it is a product of the Unc., which\nknows no other aim in its activity but the fulfilment of wishes, and\nwhich has no other forces at its disposal but wish-feelings. If we avail\nourselves for a moment longer of the right to elaborate from the dream\ninterpretation such far-reaching psychological speculations, we are in\nduty bound to demonstrate that we are thereby bringing the dream into a\nrelationship which may also comprise other psychic structures. If there\nexists a system of the Unc.\u2014or something sufficiently analogous to it\nfor the purpose of our discussion\u2014the dream cannot be its sole\nmanifestation; every dream may be a wish-fulfilment, but there must be\nother forms of abnormal wish-fulfilment besides this of dreams. Indeed,\nthe theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms culminates in the proposition\n_that they too must be taken as wish-fulfilments of the unconscious_.\nOur explanation makes the dream only the first member of a group most\nimportant for the psychiatrist, an understanding of which means the\nsolution of the purely psychological part of the psychiatric problem.\nBut other members of this group of wish-fulfilments, _e.g._, the\nhysterical symptoms, evince one essential quality which I have so far\nfailed to find in the dream. Thus, from the investigations frequently\nreferred to in this treatise, I know that the formation of an hysterical\nsymptom necessitates the combination of both streams of our psychic\nlife. The symptom is not merely the expression of a realised unconscious\nwish, but it must be joined by another wish from the foreconscious which\nis fulfilled by the same symptom; so that the symptom is at least doubly\ndetermined, once by each one of the conflicting systems. Just as in the\ndream, there is no limit to further over-determination. The\ndetermination not derived from the Unc. is, as far as I can see,\ninvariably a stream of thought in reaction against the unconscious wish,\n_e.g._, a self-punishment. Hence I may say, in general, that _an\nhysterical symptom originates only where two contrasting\nwish-fulfilments, having their source in different psychic systems, are\nable to combine in one expression_. (Compare my latest formulation of\nthe origin of the hysterical symptoms in a treatise published by the\n_Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft_, by Hirschfeld and others, 1908).\nExamples on this point would prove of little value, as nothing but a\ncomplete unveiling of the complication in question would carry\nconviction. I therefore content myself with the mere assertion, and will\ncite an example, not for conviction but for explication. The hysterical\nvomiting of a female patient proved, on the one hand, to be the\nrealisation of an unconscious fancy from the time of puberty, that she\nmight be continuously pregnant and have a multitude of children, and\nthis was subsequently united with the wish that she might have them from\nas many men as possible. Against this immoderate wish there arose a\npowerful defensive impulse. But as the vomiting might spoil the\npatient\u2019s figure and beauty, so that she would not find favour in the\neyes of mankind, the symptom was therefore in keeping with her punitive\ntrend of thought, and, being thus admissible from both sides, it was\nallowed to become a reality. This is the same manner of consenting to a\nwish-fulfilment which the queen of the Parthians chose for the triumvir\nCrassus. Believing that he had undertaken the campaign out of greed for\ngold, she caused molten gold to be poured into the throat of the corpse.\n\u201cNow hast thou what thou hast longed for.\u201d As yet we know of the dream\nonly that it expresses a wish-fulfilment of the unconscious; and\napparently the dominating foreconscious permits this only after it has\nsubjected the wish to some distortions. We are really in no position to\ndemonstrate regularly a stream of thought antagonistic to the dream-wish\nwhich is realised in the dream as in its counterpart. Only now and then\nhave we found in the dream traces of reaction formations, as, for\ninstance, the tenderness toward friend R. in the \u201cuncle dream\u201d (p. 116).\nBut the contribution from the foreconscious, which is missing here, may\nbe found in another place. While the dominating system has withdrawn on\nthe wish to sleep, the dream may bring to expression with manifold\ndistortions a wish from the Unc., and realise this wish by producing the\nnecessary changes of energy in the psychic apparatus, and may finally\nretain it through the entire duration of sleep.[FT]\nThis persistent wish to sleep on the part of the foreconscious in\ngeneral facilitates the formation of the dream. Let us refer to the\ndream of the father who, by the gleam of light from the death chamber,\nwas brought to the conclusion that the body has been set on fire. We\nhave shown that one of the psychic forces decisive in causing the father\nto form this conclusion, instead of being awakened by the gleam of\nlight, was the wish to prolong the life of the child seen in the dream\nby one moment. Other wishes proceeding from the repression probably\nescape us, because we are unable to analyse this dream. But as a second\nmotive power of the dream we may mention the father\u2019s desire to sleep,\nfor, like the life of the child, the sleep of the father is prolonged\nfor a moment by the dream. The underlying motive is: \u201cLet the dream go\non, otherwise I must wake up.\u201d As in this dream so also in all other\ndreams, the wish to sleep lends its support to the unconscious wish. On\npage 104 we reported dreams which were apparently dreams of convenience.\nBut, properly speaking, all dreams may claim this designation. The\nefficacy of the wish to continue to sleep is the most easily recognised\nin the waking dreams, which so transform the objective sensory stimulus\nas to render it compatible with the continuance of sleep; they\ninterweave this stimulus with the dream in order to rob it of any claims\nit might make as a warning to the outer world. But this wish to continue\nto sleep must also participate in the formation of all other dreams\nwhich may disturb the sleeping state from within only. \u201cNow, then, sleep\non; why, it\u2019s but a dream\u201d; this is in many cases the suggestion of the\nForec. to consciousness when the dream goes too far; and this also\ndescribes in a general way the attitude of our dominating psychic\nactivity toward dreaming, though the thought remains tacit. I must draw\nthe conclusion that _throughout our entire sleeping state we are just as\ncertain that we are dreaming as we are certain that we are sleeping_. We\nare compelled to disregard the objection urged against this conclusion\nthat our consciousness is never directed to a knowledge of the former,\nand that it is directed to a knowledge of the latter only on special\noccasions when the censor is unexpectedly surprised. Against this\nobjection we may say that there are persons who are entirely conscious\nof their sleeping and dreaming, and who are apparently endowed with the\nconscious faculty of guiding their dream life. Such a dreamer, when\ndissatisfied with the course taken by the dream, breaks it off without\nawakening, and begins it anew in order to continue it with a different\nturn, like the popular author who, on request, gives a happier ending to\nhis play. Or, at another time, if placed by the dream in a sexually\nexciting situation, he thinks in his sleep: \u201cI do not care to continue\nthis dream and exhaust myself by a pollution; I prefer to defer it in\nfavour of a real situation.\u201d\n(_d_) _Waking caused by the Dream\u2014The Function of the Dream\u2014The Anxiety\nDream._\nSince we know that the foreconscious is suspended during the night by\nthe wish to sleep, we can proceed to an intelligent investigation of the\ndream process. But let us first sum up the knowledge of this process\nalready gained. We have shown that the waking activity leaves day\nremnants from which the sum of energy cannot be entirely removed; or the\nwaking activity revives during the day one of the unconscious wishes; or\nboth conditions occur simultaneously; we have already discovered the\nmany variations that may take place. The unconscious wish has already\nmade its way to the day remnants, either during the day or at any rate\nwith the beginning of sleep, and has effected a transference to it. This\nproduces a wish transferred to the recent material, or the suppressed\nrecent wish comes to life again through a reinforcement from the\nunconscious. This wish now endeavours to make its way to consciousness\non the normal path of the mental processes through the foreconscious, to\nwhich indeed it belongs through one of its constituent elements. It is\nconfronted, however, by the censor, which is still active, and to the\ninfluence of which it now succumbs. It now takes on the distortion for\nwhich the way has already been paved by its transference to the recent\nmaterial. Thus far it is in the way of becoming something resembling an\nobsession, delusion, or the like, _i.e._ a thought reinforced by a\ntransference and distorted in expression by the censor. But its further\nprogress is now checked through the dormant state of the foreconscious;\nthis system has apparently protected itself against invasion by\ndiminishing its excitements. The dream process, therefore, takes the\nregressive course, which has just been opened by the peculiarity of the\nsleeping state, and thereby follows the attraction exerted on it by the\nmemory groups, which themselves exist in part only as visual energy not\nyet translated into terms of the later systems. On its way to regression\nthe dream takes on the form of dramatisation. The subject of compression\nwill be discussed later. The dream process has now terminated the second\npart of its repeatedly impeded course. The first part expended itself\nprogressively from the unconscious scenes or phantasies to the\nforeconscious, while the second part gravitates from the advent of the\ncensor back to the perceptions. But when the dream process becomes a\ncontent of perception it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle set up in\nthe Forec. by the censor and by the sleeping state. It succeeds in\ndrawing attention to itself and in being noticed by consciousness. For\nconsciousness, which means to us a sensory organ for the reception of\npsychic qualities, may receive stimuli from two sources\u2014first, from the\nperiphery of the entire apparatus, viz. from the perception system, and,\nsecondly, from the pleasure and pain stimuli, which constitute the sole\npsychic quality produced in the transformation of energy within the\napparatus. All other processes in the \u03a8-system, even those in the\nforeconscious, are devoid of any psychic quality, and are therefore not\nobjects of consciousness inasmuch as they do not furnish pleasure or\npain for perception. We shall have to assume that those liberations of\npleasure and pain automatically regulate the outlet of the occupation\nprocesses. But in order to make possible more delicate functions, it was\nlater found necessary to render the course of the presentations more\nindependent of the manifestations of pain. To accomplish this the Forec.\nsystem needed some qualities of its own which could attract\nconsciousness, and most probably received them through the connection of\nthe foreconscious processes with the memory system of the signs of\nspeech, which is not devoid of qualities. Through the qualities of this\nsystem, consciousness, which had hitherto been a sensory organ only for\nthe perceptions, now becomes also a sensory organ for a part of our\nmental processes. Thus we have now, as it were, two sensory surfaces,\none directed to perceptions and the other to the foreconscious mental\nprocesses.\nI must assume that the sensory surface of consciousness devoted to the\nForec. is rendered less excitable by sleep than that directed to the\nP-systems. The giving up of interest for the nocturnal mental processes\nis indeed purposeful. Nothing is to disturb the mind; the Forec. wants\nto sleep. But once the dream becomes a perception, it is then capable of\nexciting consciousness through the qualities thus gained. The sensory\nstimulus accomplishes what it was really destined for, namely, it\ndirects a part of the energy at the disposal of the Forec. in the form\nof attention upon the stimulant. We must, therefore, admit that the\ndream invariably awakens us, that is, it puts into activity a part of\nthe dormant force of the Forec. This force imparts to the dream that\ninfluence which we have designated as secondary elaboration for the sake\nof connection and comprehensibility. This means that the dream is\ntreated by it like any other content of perception; it is subjected to\nthe same ideas of expectation, as far at least as the material admits.\nAs far as the direction is concerned in this third part of the dream, it\nmay be said that here again the movement is progressive.\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it will not be amiss to say a few words about\nthe temporal peculiarities of these dream processes. In a very\ninteresting discussion, apparently suggested by Maury\u2019s puzzling\nguillotine dream, Goblot[29] tries to demonstrate that the dream\nrequires no other time than the transition period between sleeping and\nawakening. The awakening requires time, as the dream takes place during\nthat period. One is inclined to believe that the final picture of the\ndream is so strong that it forces the dreamer to awaken; but, as a\nmatter of fact, this picture is strong only because the dreamer is\nalready very near awakening when it appears. \u201cUn r\u00eave c\u2019est un r\u00e9veil\nqui commence.\u201d\nIt has already been emphasized by Dugas[18] that Goblot was forced to\nrepudiate many facts in order to generalise his theory. There are,\nmoreover, dreams from which we do not awaken, _e.g._, some dreams in\nwhich we dream that we dream. From our knowledge of the dream-work, we\ncan by no means admit that it extends only over the period of awakening.\nOn the contrary, we must consider it probable that the first part of the\ndream-work begins during the day when we are still under the domination\nof the foreconscious. The second phase of the dream-work, viz. the\nmodification through the censor, the attraction by the unconscious\nscenes, and the penetration to perception must continue throughout the\nnight. And we are probably always right when we assert that we feel as\nthough we had been dreaming the whole night, although we cannot say\nwhat. I do not, however, think it necessary to assume that, up to the\ntime of becoming conscious, the dream processes really follow the\ntemporal sequence which we have described, viz. that there is first the\ntransferred dream-wish, then the distortion of the censor, and\nconsequently the change of direction to regression, and so on. We were\nforced to form such a succession for the sake of _description_; in\nreality, however, it is much rather a matter of simultaneously trying\nthis path and that, and of emotions fluctuating to and fro, until\nfinally, owing to the most expedient distribution, one particular\ngrouping is secured which remains. From certain personal experiences, I\nam myself inclined to believe that the dream-work often requires more\nthan one day and one night to produce its result; if this be true, the\nextraordinary art manifested in the construction of the dream loses all\nits marvels. In my opinion, even the regard for comprehensibility as an\noccurrence of perception may take effect before the dream attracts\nconsciousness to itself. To be sure, from now on the process is\naccelerated, as the dream is henceforth subjected to the same treatment\nas any other perception. It is like fireworks, which require hours of\npreparation and only a moment for ignition.\nThrough the dream-work the dream process now gains either sufficient\nintensity to attract consciousness to itself and arouse the\nforeconscious, which is quite independent of the time or profundity of\nsleep, or, its intensity being insufficient it must wait until it meets\nthe attention which is set in motion immediately before awakening. Most\ndreams seem to operate with relatively slight psychic intensities, for\nthey wait for the awakening. This, however, explains the fact that we\nregularly perceive something dreamt on being suddenly aroused from a\nsound sleep. Here, as well as in spontaneous awakening, the first glance\nstrikes the perception content created by the dream-work, while the next\nstrikes the one produced from without.\nBut of greater theoretical interest are those dreams which are capable\nof waking us in the midst of sleep. We must bear in mind the expediency\nelsewhere universally demonstrated, and ask ourselves why the dream or\nthe unconscious wish has the power to disturb sleep, _i.e._ the\nfulfilment of the foreconscious wish. This is probably due to certain\nrelations of energy into which we have no insight. If we possessed such\ninsight we should probably find that the freedom given to the dream and\nthe expenditure of a certain amount of detached attention represent for\nthe dream an economy in energy, keeping in view the fact that the\nunconscious must be held in check at night just as during the day. We\nknow from experience that the dream, even if it interrupts sleep,\nrepeatedly during the same night, still remains compatible with sleep.\nWe wake up for an instant, and immediately resume our sleep. It is like\ndriving off a fly during sleep, we awake _ad hoc_, and when we resume\nour sleep we have removed the disturbance. As demonstrated by familiar\nexamples from the sleep of wet nurses, &c., the fulfilment of the wish\nto sleep is quite compatible with the retention of a certain amount of\nattention in a given direction.\nBut we must here take cognisance of an objection that is based on a\nbetter knowledge of the unconscious processes. Although we have\nourselves described the unconscious wishes as always active, we have,\nnevertheless, asserted that they are not sufficiently strong during the\nday to make themselves perceptible. But when we sleep, and the\nunconscious wish has shown its power to form a dream, and with it to\nawaken the foreconscious, why, then, does this power become exhausted\nafter the dream has been taken cognisance of? Would it not seem more\nprobable that the dream should continually renew itself, like the\ntroublesome fly which, when driven away, takes pleasure in returning\nagain and again? What justifies our assertion that the dream removes the\ndisturbance of sleep?\nThat the unconscious wishes always remain active is quite true. They\nrepresent paths which are passable whenever a sum of excitement makes\nuse of them. Moreover, a remarkable peculiarity of the unconscious\nprocesses is the fact that they remain indestructible. Nothing can be\nbrought to an end in the unconscious; nothing can cease or be forgotten.\nThis impression is most strongly gained in the study of the neuroses,\nespecially of hysteria. The unconscious stream of thought which leads to\nthe discharge through an attack becomes passable again as soon as there\nis an accumulation of a sufficient amount of excitement. The\nmortification brought on thirty years ago, after having gained access to\nthe unconscious affective source, operates during all these thirty years\nlike a recent one. Whenever its memory is touched, it is revived and\nshows itself to be supplied with the excitement which is discharged in a\nmotor attack. It is just here that the office of psychotherapy begins,\nits task being to bring about adjustment and forgetfulness for the\nunconscious processes. Indeed, the fading of memories and the flagging\nof affects, which we are apt to take as self-evident and to explain as a\nprimary influence of time on the psychic memories, are in reality\nsecondary changes brought about by painstaking work. It is the\nforeconscious that accomplishes this work; and the only course to be\npursued by psychotherapy is to subjugate the Unc. to the domination of\nthe Forec.\nThere are, therefore, two exits for the individual unconscious emotional\nprocess. It is either left to itself, in which case it ultimately breaks\nthrough somewhere and secures for once a discharge for its excitation\ninto motility; or it succumbs to the influence of the foreconscious, and\nits excitation becomes confined through this influence instead of being\ndischarged. It is the latter process that occurs in the dream. Owing to\nthe fact that it is directed by the conscious excitement, the energy\nfrom the Forec., which confronts the dream when grown to perception,\nrestricts the unconscious excitement of the dream and renders it\nharmless as a disturbing factor. When the dreamer wakes up for a moment,\nhe has actually chased away the fly that has threatened to disturb his\nsleep. We can now understand that it is really more expedient and\neconomical to give full sway to the unconscious wish, and clear its way\nto regression so that it may form a dream, and then restrict and adjust\nthis dream by means of a small expenditure of foreconscious labour, than\nto curb the unconscious throughout the entire period of sleep. We\nshould, indeed, expect that the dream, even if it was not originally an\nexpedient process, would have acquired some function in the play of\nforces of the psychic life. We now see what this function is. The dream\nhas taken it upon itself to bring the liberated excitement of the Unc.\nback under the domination of the foreconscious; it thus affords relief\nfor the excitement of the Unc. and acts as a safety-valve for the\nlatter, and at the same time it insures the sleep of the foreconscious\nat a slight expenditure of the waking state. Like the other psychic\nformations of its group, the dream offers itself as a compromise serving\nsimultaneously both systems by fulfilling both wishes in so far as they\nare compatible with each other. A glance at Robert\u2019s \u201celimination\ntheory,\u201d referred to on page 66, will show that we must agree with this\nauthor in his main point, viz. in the determination of the function of\nthe dream, though we differ from him in our hypotheses and in our\ntreatment of the dream process.\nThe above qualification\u2014in so far as the two wishes are compatible with\neach other\u2014contains a suggestion that there may be cases in which the\nfunction of the dream suffers shipwreck. The dream process is in the\nfirst instance admitted as a wish-fulfilment of the unconscious, but if\nthis tentative wish-fulfilment disturbs the foreconscious to such an\nextent that the latter can no longer maintain its rest, the dream then\nbreaks the compromise and fails to perform the second part of its task.\nIt is then at once broken off, and replaced by complete wakefulness.\nHere, too, it is not really the fault of the dream, if, while ordinarily\nthe guardian of sleep, it is here compelled to appear as the disturber\nof sleep, nor should this cause us to entertain any doubts as to its\nefficacy. This is not the only case in the organism in which an\notherwise efficacious arrangement became inefficacious and disturbing as\nsoon as some element is changed in the conditions of its origin; the\ndisturbance then serves at least the new purpose of announcing the\nchange, and calling into play against it the means of adjustment of the\norganism. In this connection, I naturally bear in mind the case of the\nanxiety dream, and in order not to have the appearance of trying to\nexclude this testimony against the theory of wish-fulfilment wherever I\nencounter it, I will attempt an explanation of the anxiety dream, at\nleast offering some suggestions.\nThat a psychic process developing anxiety may still be a wish-fulfilment\nhas long ceased to impress us as a contradiction. We may explain this\noccurrence by the fact that the wish belongs to one system (the Unc.),\nwhile by the other system (the Forec.), this wish has been rejected and\nsuppressed. The subjection of the Unc. by the Forec. is not complete\neven in perfect psychic health; the amount of this suppression shows the\ndegree of our psychic normality. Neurotic symptoms show that there is a\nconflict between the two systems; the symptoms are the results of a\ncompromise of this conflict, and they temporarily put an end to it. On\nthe one hand, they afford the Unc. an outlet for the discharge of its\nexcitement, and serve it as a sally port, while, on the other hand, they\ngive the Forec. the capability of dominating the Unc. to some extent. It\nis highly instructive to consider, _e.g._, the significance of any\nhysterical phobia or of an agoraphobia. Suppose a neurotic incapable of\ncrossing the street alone, which we would justly call a \u201csymptom.\u201d We\nattempt to remove this symptom by urging him to the action which he\ndeems himself incapable of. The result will be an attack of anxiety,\njust as an attack of anxiety in the street has often been the cause of\nestablishing an agoraphobia. We thus learn that the symptom has been\nconstituted in order to guard against the outbreak of the anxiety. The\nphobia is thrown before the anxiety like a fortress on the frontier.\nUnless we enter into the part played by the affects in these processes,\nwhich can be done here only imperfectly, we cannot continue our\ndiscussion. Let us therefore advance the proposition that the reason why\nthe suppression of the unconscious becomes absolutely necessary is\nbecause, if the discharge of presentation should be left to itself, it\nwould develop an affect in the Unc. which originally bore the character\nof pleasure, but which, since the appearance of the repression, bears\nthe character of pain. The aim, as well as the result, of the\nsuppression is to stop the development of this pain. The suppression\nextends over the unconscious ideation, because the liberation of pain\nmight emanate from the ideation. The foundation is here laid for a very\ndefinite assumption concerning the nature of the affective development.\nIt is regarded as a motor or secondary activity, the key to the\ninnervation of which is located in the presentations of the Unc. Through\nthe domination of the Forec. these presentations become, as it were,\nthrottled and inhibited at the exit of the emotion-developing impulses.\nThe danger, which is due to the fact that the Forec. ceases to occupy\nthe energy, therefore consists in the fact that the unconscious\nexcitations liberate such an affect as\u2014in consequence of the repression\nthat has previously taken place\u2014can only be perceived as pain or\nanxiety.\nThis danger is released through the full sway of the dream process. The\ndeterminations for its realisation consist in the fact that repressions\nhave taken place, and that the suppressed emotional wishes shall become\nsufficiently strong. They thus stand entirely without the psychological\nrealm of the dream structure. Were it not for the fact that our subject\nis connected through just one factor, namely, the freeing of the Unc.\nduring sleep, with the subject of the development of anxiety, I could\ndispense with discussion of the anxiety dream, and thus avoid all\nobscurities connected with it.\nAs I have often repeated, the theory of the anxiety belongs to the\npsychology of the neuroses. I would say that the anxiety in the dream is\nan anxiety problem and not a dream problem. We have nothing further to\ndo with it after having once demonstrated its point of contact with the\nsubject of the dream process. There is only one thing left for me to do.\nAs I have asserted that the neurotic anxiety originates from sexual\nsources, I can subject anxiety dreams to analysis in order to\ndemonstrate the sexual material in their dream thoughts.\nFor good reasons I refrain from citing here any of the numerous examples\nplaced at my disposal by neurotic patients, but prefer to give anxiety\ndreams from young persons.\nPersonally, I have had no real anxiety dream for decades, but I recall\none from my seventh or eighth year which I subjected to interpretation\nabout thirty years later. The dream was very vivid, and showed me _my\nbeloved mother, with peculiarly calm sleeping countenance, carried into\nthe room and laid on the bed by two (or three) persons with bird\u2019s\nbeaks_. I awoke crying and screaming, and disturbed my parents. The very\ntall figures\u2014draped in a peculiar manner\u2014with beaks, I had taken from\nthe illustrations of Philippson\u2019s bible; I believe they represented\ndeities with heads of sparrowhawks from an Egyptian tomb relief. The\nanalysis also introduced the reminiscence of a naughty janitor\u2019s boy,\nwho used to play with us children on the meadow in front of the house; I\nwould add that his name was Philip. I feel that I first heard from this\nboy the vulgar word signifying sexual intercourse, which is replaced\namong the educated by the Latin \u201ccoitus,\u201d but to which the dream\ndistinctly alludes by the selection of the bird\u2019s heads.[FU] I must have\nsuspected the sexual significance of the word from the facial expression\nof my worldly-wise teacher. My mother\u2019s features in the dream were\ncopied from the countenance of my grandfather, whom I had seen a few\ndays before his death snoring in the state of coma. The interpretation\nof the secondary elaboration in the dream must therefore have been that\nmy mother was dying; the tomb relief, too, agrees with this. In this\nanxiety I awoke, and could not calm myself until I had awakened my\nparents. I remember that I suddenly became calm on coming face to face\nwith my mother, as if I needed the assurance that my mother was not\ndead. But this secondary interpretation of the dream had been effected\nonly under the influence of the developed anxiety. I was not frightened\nbecause I dreamed that my mother was dying, but I interpreted the dream\nin this manner in the foreconscious elaboration because I was already\nunder the domination of the anxiety. The latter, however, could be\ntraced by means of the repression to an obscure obviously sexual desire,\nwhich had found its satisfying expression in the visual content of the\ndream.\nA man twenty-seven years old who had been severely ill for a year had\nhad many terrifying dreams between the ages of eleven and thirteen. He\nthought that a man with an axe was running after him; he wished to run,\nbut felt paralysed and could not move from the spot. This may be taken\nas a good example of a very common, and apparently sexually indifferent,\nanxiety dream. In the analysis the dreamer first thought of a story told\nhim by his uncle, which chronologically was later than the dream, viz.\nthat he was attacked at night by a suspicious-looking individual. This\noccurrence led him to believe that he himself might have already heard\nof a similar episode at the time of the dream. In connection with the\naxe he recalled that during that period of his life he once hurt his\nhand with an axe while chopping wood. This immediately led to his\nrelations with his younger brother, whom he used to maltreat and knock\ndown. In particular, he recalled an occasion when he struck his brother\non the head with his boot until he bled, whereupon his mother remarked:\n\u201cI fear he will kill him some day.\u201d While he was seemingly thinking of\nthe subject of violence, a reminiscence from his ninth year suddenly\noccurred to him. His parents came home late and went to bed while he was\nfeigning sleep. He soon heard panting and other noises that appeared\nstrange to him, and he could also make out the position of his parents\nin bed. His further associations showed that he had established an\nanalogy between this relation between his parents and his own relation\ntoward his younger brother. He subsumed what occurred between his\nparents under the conception \u201cviolence and wrestling,\u201d and thus reached\na sadistic conception of the coitus act, as often happens among\nchildren. The fact that he often noticed blood on his mother\u2019s bed\ncorroborated his conception.\nThat the sexual intercourse of adults appears strange to children who\nobserve it, and arouses fear in them, I dare say is a fact of daily\nexperience. I have explained this fear by the fact that sexual\nexcitement is not mastered by their understanding, and is probably also\ninacceptable to them because their parents are involved in it. For the\nsame reason this excitement is converted into fear. At a still earlier\nperiod of life sexual emotion directed toward the parent of opposite sex\ndoes not meet with repression but finds free expression, as we have seen\nabove (pp. 209\u2013215).\nFor the night terrors with hallucinations (_pavor nocturnus_) frequently\nfound in children, I would unhesitatingly give the same explanation.\nHere, too, we are certainly dealing with the incomprehensible and\nrejected sexual feelings, which, if noted, would probably show a\ntemporal periodicity, for an enhancement of the sexual _libido_ may just\nas well be produced accidentally through emotional impressions as\nthrough the spontaneous and gradual processes of development.\nI lack the necessary material to sustain these explanations from\nobservation. On the other hand, the pediatrists seem to lack the point\nof view which alone makes comprehensible the whole series of phenomena,\non the somatic as well as on the psychic side. To illustrate by a\ncomical example how one wearing the blinders of medical mythology may\nmiss the understanding of such cases, I will relate a case which I found\nin a thesis on _pavor nocturnus_ by _Debacker_,[17] 1881 (p. 66). A\nthirteen-year-old boy of delicate health began to become anxious and\ndreamy; his sleep became restless, and about once a week it was\ninterrupted by an acute attack of anxiety with hallucinations. The\nmemory of these dreams was invariably very distinct. Thus, he related\nthat the _devil_ shouted at him: \u201cNow we have you, now we have you,\u201d and\nthis was followed by an odour of sulphur; the fire burned his skin. This\ndream aroused him, terror-stricken. He was unable to scream at first;\nthen his voice returned, and he was heard to say distinctly: \u201cNo, no,\nnot me; why, I have done nothing,\u201d or, \u201cPlease don\u2019t, I shall never do\nit again.\u201d Occasionally, also, he said: \u201cAlbert has not done that.\u201d\nLater he avoided undressing, because, as he said, the fire attacked him\nonly when he was undressed. From amid these evil dreams, which menaced\nhis health, he was sent into the country, where he recovered within a\nyear and a half, but at the age of fifteen he once confessed: \u201cJe\nn\u2019osais pas l\u2019avouer, mais j\u2019\u00e9prouvais continuellement des picotements\net des surexcitations aux _parties_;[FV] \u00e0 la fin, cela m\u2019\u00e9nervait tant\nque plusieurs fois, j\u2019ai pens\u00e9 me jeter par la fen\u00eatre au dortoir.\u201d\nIt is certainly not difficult to suspect: 1, that the boy had practised\nmasturbation in former years, that he probably denied it, and was\nthreatened with severe punishment for his wrongdoing (his confession: Je\nne le ferai plus; his denial: Albert n\u2019a jamais fait \u00e7a). 2, That under\nthe pressure of puberty the temptation to self-abuse through the\ntickling of the genitals was reawakened. 3, That now, however, a\nstruggle of repression arose in him, suppressing the _libido_ and\nchanging it into fear, which subsequently took the form of the\npunishments with which he was then threatened.\nLet us, however, quote the conclusions drawn by our author (p. 69). This\nobservation shows: 1, That the influence of puberty may produce in a boy\nof delicate health a condition of extreme weakness, and that it may lead\nto a _very marked cerebral an\u00e6mia_.[FW]\n2. This cerebral an\u00e6mia produces a transformation of character,\ndemonomaniacal hallucinations, and very violent nocturnal, perhaps also\ndiurnal, states of anxiety.\n3. Demonomania and the self-reproaches of the day can be traced to the\ninfluences of religious education which the subject underwent as a\nchild.\n4. All manifestations disappeared as a result of a lengthy sojourn in\nthe country, bodily exercise, and the return of physical strength after\nthe termination of the period of puberty.\n5. A predisposing influence for the origin of the cerebral condition of\nthe boy may be attributed to heredity and to the father\u2019s chronic\nsyphilitic state.\nThe concluding remarks of the author read: \u201cNous avons fait entrer cette\nobservation dans le cadre des d\u00e9lires apyr\u00e9tiques d\u2019inanition, car c\u2019est\n\u00e0 l\u2019isch\u00e9mie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale que nous rattachons cet \u00e9tat particulier.\u201d\n(_e_) _The Primary and Secondary Processes\u2014Regression._\nIn venturing to attempt to penetrate more deeply into the psychology of\nthe dream processes, I have undertaken a difficult task, to which,\nindeed, my power of description is hardly equal. To reproduce in\ndescription by a succession of words the simultaneousness of so complex\na chain of events, and in doing so to appear unbiassed throughout the\nexposition, goes fairly beyond my powers. I have now to atone for the\nfact that I have been unable in my description of the dream psychology\nto follow the historic development of my views. The view-points for my\nconception of the dream were reached through earlier investigations in\nthe psychology of the neuroses, to which I am not supposed to refer\nhere, but to which I am repeatedly forced to refer, whereas I should\nprefer to proceed in the opposite direction, and, starting from the\ndream, to establish a connection with the psychology of the neuroses. I\nam well aware of all the inconveniences arising for the reader from this\ndifficulty, but I know of no way to avoid them.\nAs I am dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I am glad to dwell upon\nanother viewpoint which seems to raise the value of my efforts. As has\nbeen shown in the introduction to the first chapter, I found myself\nconfronted with a theme which had been marked by the sharpest\ncontradictions on the part of the authorities. After our elaboration of\nthe dream problems we found room for most of these contradictions. We\nhave been forced, however, to take decided exception to two of the views\npronounced, viz. that the dream is a senseless and that it is a somatic\nprocess; apart from these cases we have had to accept all the\ncontradictory views in one place or another of the complicated argument,\nand we have been able to demonstrate that they had discovered something\nthat was correct. That the dream continues the impulses and interests of\nthe waking state has been quite generally confirmed through the\ndiscovery of the latent thoughts of the dream. These thoughts concern\nthemselves only with things that seem important and of momentous\ninterest to us. The dream never occupies itself with trifles. But we\nhave also concurred with the contrary view, viz. that the dream gathers\nup the indifferent remnants from the day, and that not until it has in\nsome measure withdrawn itself from the waking activity can an important\nevent of the day be taken up by the dream. We found this holding true\nfor the dream content, which gives the dream thought its changed\nexpression by means of disfigurement. We have said that from the nature\nof the association mechanism the dream process more easily takes\npossession of recent or indifferent material which has not yet been\nseized by the waking mental activity; and by reason of the censor it\ntransfers the psychic intensity from the important but also disagreeable\nto the indifferent material. The hypermnesia of the dream and the resort\nto infantile material have become main supports in our theory. In our\ntheory of the dream we have attributed to the wish originating from the\ninfantile the part of an indispensable motor for the formation of the\ndream. We naturally could not think of doubting the experimentally\ndemonstrated significance of the objective sensory stimuli during sleep;\nbut we have brought this material into the same relation to the\ndream-wish as the thought remnants from the waking activity. There was\nno need of disputing the fact that the dream interprets the objective\nsensory stimuli after the manner of an illusion; but we have supplied\nthe motive for this interpretation which has been left undecided by the\nauthorities. The interpretation follows in such a manner that the\nperceived object is rendered harmless as a sleep disturber and becomes\navailable for the wish-fulfilment. Though we do not admit as special\nsources of the dream the subjective state of excitement of the sensory\norgans during sleep, which seems to have been demonstrated by Trumbull\nLadd,[40] we are nevertheless able to explain this excitement through\nthe regressive revival of active memories behind the dream. A modest\npart in our conception has also been assigned to the inner organic\nsensations which are wont to be taken as the cardinal point in the\nexplanation of the dream. These\u2014the sensation of falling, flying, or\ninhibition\u2014stand as an ever ready material to be used by the dream-work\nto express the dream thought as often as need arises.\nThat the dream process is a rapid and momentary one seems to be true for\nthe perception through consciousness of the already prepared dream\ncontent; the preceding parts of the dream process probably take a slow,\nfluctuating course. We have solved the riddle of the superabundant dream\ncontent compressed within the briefest moment by explaining that this is\ndue to the appropriation of almost fully formed structures from the\npsychic life. That the dream is disfigured and distorted by memory we\nfound to be correct, but not troublesome, as this is only the last\nmanifest operation in the work of disfigurement which has been active\nfrom the beginning of the dream-work. In the bitter and seemingly\nirreconcilable controversy as to whether the psychic life sleeps at\nnight or can make the same use of all its capabilities as during the\nday, we have been able to agree with both sides, though not fully with\neither. We have found proof that the dream thoughts represent a most\ncomplicated intellectual activity, employing almost every means\nfurnished by the psychic apparatus; still it cannot be denied that these\ndream thoughts have originated during the day, and it is indispensable\nto assume that there is a sleeping state of the psychic life. Thus, even\nthe theory of partial sleep has come into play; but the characteristics\nof the sleeping state have been found not in the dilapidation of the\npsychic connections but in the cessation of the psychic system\ndominating the day, arising from its desire to sleep. The withdrawal\nfrom the outer world retains its significance also for our conception;\nthough not the only factor, it nevertheless helps the regression to make\npossible the representation of the dream. That we should reject the\nvoluntary guidance of the presentation course is uncontestable; but the\npsychic life does not thereby become aimless, for we have seen that\nafter the abandonment of the desired end-presentation undesired ones\ngain the mastery. The loose associative connection in the dream we have\nnot only recognised, but we have placed under its control a far greater\nterritory than could have been supposed; we have, however, found it\nmerely the feigned substitute for another correct and senseful one. To\nbe sure we, too, have called the dream absurd; but we have been able to\nlearn from examples how wise the dream really is when it simulates\nabsurdity. We do not deny any of the functions that have been attributed\nto the dream. That the dream relieves the mind like a valve, and that,\naccording to Robert\u2019s assertion, all kinds of harmful material are\nrendered harmless through representation in the dream, not only exactly\ncoincides with our theory of the two-fold wish-fulfilment in the dream,\nbut, in his own wording, becomes even more comprehensible for us than\nfor Robert himself. The free indulgence of the psychic in the play of\nits faculties finds expression with us in the non-interference with the\ndream on the part of the foreconscious activity. The \u201creturn to the\nembryonal state of psychic life in the dream\u201d and the observation of\nHavelock Ellis,[23] \u201can archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\nthoughts,\u201d appear to us as happy anticipations of our deductions to the\neffect that _primitive_ modes of work suppressed during the day\nparticipate in the formation of the dream; and with us, as with\nDelage,[15] the _suppressed_ material becomes the mainspring of the\ndreaming.\nWe have fully recognised the r\u00f4le which Scherner ascribes to the dream\nphantasy, and even his interpretation; but we have been obliged, so to\nspeak, to conduct them to another department in the problem. It is not\nthe dream that produces the phantasy but the unconscious phantasy that\ntakes the greatest part in the formation of the dream thoughts. We are\nindebted to Scherner for his clue to the source of the dream thoughts,\nbut almost everything that he ascribes to the dream-work is attributable\nto the activity of the unconscious, which is at work during the day, and\nwhich supplies incitements not only for dreams but for neurotic symptoms\nas well. We have had to separate the dream-work from this activity as\nbeing something entirely different and far more restricted. Finally, we\nhave by no means abandoned the relation of the dream to mental\ndisturbances, but, on the contrary, we have given it a more solid\nfoundation on new ground.\nThus held together by the new material of our theory as by a superior\nunity, we find the most varied and most contradictory conclusions of the\nauthorities fitting into our structure; some of them are differently\ndisposed, only a few of them are entirely rejected. But our own\nstructure is still unfinished. For, disregarding the many obscurities\nwhich we have necessarily encountered in our advance into the darkness\nof psychology, we are now apparently embarrassed by a new contradiction.\nOn the one hand, we have allowed the dream thoughts to proceed from\nperfectly normal mental operations, while, on the other hand, we have\nfound among the dream thoughts a number of entirely abnormal mental\nprocesses which extend likewise to the dream contents. These,\nconsequently, we have repeated in the interpretation of the dream. All\nthat we have termed the \u201cdream-work\u201d seems so remote from the psychic\nprocesses recognised by us as correct, that the severest judgments of\nthe authors as to the low psychic activity of dreaming seem to us well\nfounded.\nPerhaps only through still further advance can enlightenment and\nimprovement be brought about. I shall pick out one of the constellations\nleading to the formation of dreams.\nWe have learned that the dream replaces a number of thoughts derived\nfrom daily life which are perfectly formed logically. We cannot\ntherefore doubt that these thoughts originate from our normal mental\nlife. All the qualities which we esteem in our mental operations, and\nwhich distinguish these as complicated activities of a high order, we\nfind repeated in the dream thoughts. There is, however, no need of\nassuming that this mental work is performed during sleep, as this would\nmaterially impair the conception of the psychic state of sleep we have\nhitherto adhered to. These thoughts may just as well have originated\nfrom the day, and, unnoticed by our consciousness from their inception,\nthey may have continued to develop until they stood complete at the\nonset of sleep. If we are to conclude anything from this state of\naffairs, it will at most prove _that the most complex mental operations\nare possible without the co-operation of consciousness_, which we have\nalready learned independently from every psychoanalysis of persons\nsuffering from hysteria or obsessions. These dream thoughts are in\nthemselves surely not incapable of consciousness; if they have not\nbecome conscious to us during the day, this may have various reasons.\nThe state of becoming conscious depends on the exercise of a certain\npsychic function, viz. attention, which seems to be extended only in a\ndefinite quantity, and which may have been withdrawn from the stream of\nthought in question by other aims. Another way in which such mental\nstreams are kept from consciousness is the following:\u2014Our conscious\nreflection teaches us that when exercising attention we pursue a\ndefinite course. But if that course leads us to an idea which does not\nhold its own with the critic, we discontinue and cease to apply our\nattention. Now, apparently, the stream of thought thus started and\nabandoned may spin on without regaining attention unless it reaches a\nspot of especially marked intensity which forces the return of\nattention. An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought about by\nthe judgment on the ground of incorrectness or unfitness for the actual\npurpose of the mental act, may therefore account for the fact that a\nmental process continues until the onset of sleep unnoticed by\nconsciousness.\nLet us recapitulate by saying that we call such a stream of thought a\nforeconscious one, that we believe it to be perfectly correct, and that\nit may just as well be a more neglected one or an interrupted and\nsuppressed one. Let us also state frankly in what manner we conceive\nthis presentation course. We believe that a certain sum of excitement,\nwhich we call occupation energy, is displaced from an end-presentation\nalong the association paths selected by that end-presentation. A\n\u201cneglected\u201d stream of thought has received no such occupation, and from\na \u201csuppressed\u201d or \u201crejected\u201d one this occupation has been withdrawn;\nboth have thus been left to their own emotions. The end-stream of\nthought stocked with energy is under certain conditions able to draw to\nitself the attention of consciousness, through which means it then\nreceives a \u201csurplus of energy.\u201d We shall be obliged somewhat later to\nelucidate our assumption concerning the nature and activity of\nconsciousness.\nA train of thought thus incited in the Forec. may either disappear\nspontaneously or continue. The former issue we conceive as follows: It\ndiffuses its energy through all the association paths emanating from it,\nand throws the entire chain of ideas into a state of excitement which,\nafter lasting for a while, subsides through the transformation of the\nexcitement requiring an outlet into dormant energy.[FX] If this first\nissue is brought about the process has no further significance for the\ndream formation. But other end-presentations are lurking in our\nforeconscious that originate from the sources of our unconscious and\nfrom the ever active wishes. These may take possession of the\nexcitations in the circle of thought thus left to itself, establish a\nconnection between it and the unconscious wish, and transfer to it the\nenergy inherent in the unconscious wish. Henceforth the neglected or\nsuppressed train of thought is in a position to maintain itself,\nalthough this reinforcement does not help it to gain access to\nconsciousness. We may say that the hitherto foreconscious train of\nthought has been drawn into the unconscious.\nOther constellations for the dream formation would result if the\nforeconscious train of thought had from the beginning been connected\nwith the unconscious wish, and for that reason met with rejection by the\ndominating end-occupation; or if an unconscious wish were made active\nfor other\u2014possibly somatic\u2014reasons and of its own accord sought a\ntransference to the psychic remnants not occupied by the Forec. All\nthree cases finally combine in one issue, so that there is established\nin the foreconscious a stream of thought which, having been abandoned by\nthe foreconscious occupation, receives occupation from the unconscious\nwish.\nThe stream of thought is henceforth subjected to a series of\ntransformations which we no longer recognise as normal psychic processes\nand which give us a surprising result, viz. a psychopathological\nformation. Let us emphasize and group the same.\n1. The intensities of the individual ideas become capable of discharge\nin their entirety, and, proceeding from one conception to the other,\nthey thus form single presentations endowed with marked intensity.\nThrough the repeated recurrence of this process the intensity of an\nentire train of ideas may ultimately be gathered in a single\npresentation element. This is the principle of _compression or\ncondensation_ with which we became acquainted in the chapter on \u201cThe\nDream-Work.\u201d It is condensation that is mainly responsible for the\nstrange impression of the dream, for we know of nothing analogous to it\nin the normal psychic life accessible to consciousness. We find here,\nalso, presentations which possess great psychic significance as\njunctions or as end-results of whole chains of thought; but this\nvalidity does not manifest itself in any character conspicuous enough\nfor internal perception; hence, what has been presented in it does not\nbecome in any way more intensive. In the process of condensation the\nentire psychic connection becomes transformed into the intensity of the\npresentation content. It is the same as in a book where we space or\nprint in heavy type any word upon which particular stress is laid for\nthe understanding of the text. In speech the same word would be\npronounced loudly and deliberately and with emphasis. The first\ncomparison leads us at once to an example taken from the chapter on \u201cThe\nDream-Work\u201d (trimethylamine in the dream of Irma\u2019s injection).\nHistorians of art call our attention to the fact that the most ancient\nhistorical sculptures follow a similar principle in expressing the rank\nof the persons represented by the size of the statue. The king is made\ntwo or three times as large as his retinue or the vanquished enemy. A\npiece of art, however, from the Roman period makes use of more subtle\nmeans to accomplish the same purpose. The figure of the emperor is\nplaced in the centre in a firmly erect posture; special care is bestowed\non the proper modelling of his figure; his enemies are seen cowering at\nhis feet; but he is no longer represented a giant among dwarfs. However,\nthe bowing of the subordinate to his superior in our own days is only an\necho of that ancient principle of representation.\nThe direction taken by the condensations of the dream is prescribed on\nthe one hand by the true foreconscious relations of the dream thoughts,\non the other hand by the attraction of the visual reminiscences in the\nunconscious. The success of the condensation work produces those\nintensities which are required for penetration into the perception\nsystems.\n2. Through this free transferability of the intensities,\nmoreover, and in the service of condensation, _intermediary\npresentations_\u2014compromises, as it were\u2014are formed (_cf._ the numerous\nexamples). This, likewise, is something unheard of in the normal\npresentation course, where it is above all a question of selection and\nretention of the \u201cproper\u201d presentation element. On the other hand,\ncomposite and compromise formations occur with extraordinary frequency\nwhen we are trying to find the linguistic expression for foreconscious\nthoughts; these are considered \u201cslips of the tongue.\u201d\n3. The presentations which transfer their intensities to one another are\n_very loosely connected_, and are joined together by such forms of\nassociation as are spurned in our serious thought and are utilised in\nthe production of the effect of wit only. Among these we particularly\nfind associations of the sound and consonance types.\n4. Contradictory thoughts do not strive to eliminate one another, but\nremain side by side. They often unite to produce condensation _as if no\ncontradiction_ existed, or they form compromises for which we should\nnever forgive our thoughts, but which we frequently approve of in our\nactions.\nThese are some of the most conspicuous abnormal processes to which the\nthoughts which have previously been rationally formed are subjected in\nthe course of the dream-work. As the main feature of these processes we\nrecognise the high importance attached to the fact of rendering the\noccupation energy mobile and capable of discharge; the content and the\nactual significance of the psychic elements, to which these energies\nadhere, become a matter of secondary importance. One might possibly\nthink that the condensation and compromise formation is effected only in\nthe service of regression, when occasion arises for changing thoughts\ninto pictures. But the analysis and\u2014still more distinctly\u2014the synthesis\nof dreams which lack regression toward pictures, _e.g._ the dream\n\u201cAutodidasker\u2014Conversation with Court-Councillor N.,\u201d present the same\nprocesses of displacement and condensation as the others.\nHence we cannot refuse to acknowledge that the two kinds of essentially\ndifferent psychic processes participate in the formation of the dream;\none forms perfectly correct dream thoughts which are equivalent to\nnormal thoughts, while the other treats these ideas in a highly\nsurprising and incorrect manner. The latter process we have already set\napart in Chapter VI as the dream-work proper. What have we now to\nadvance concerning this latter psychic process?\nWe should be unable to answer this question here if we had not\npenetrated considerably into the psychology of the neuroses and\nespecially of hysteria. From this we learn that the same\nincorrect psychic processes\u2014as well as others that have not been\nenumerated\u2014control the formation of hysterical symptoms. In hysteria,\ntoo, we at once find a series of perfectly correct thoughts equivalent\nto our conscious thoughts, of whose existence, however, in this form we\ncan learn nothing and which we can only subsequently reconstruct. If\nthey have forced their way anywhere to our perception, we discover from\nthe analysis of the symptom formed that these normal thoughts have been\nsubjected to abnormal treatment and _have been transformed into the\nsymptom by means of condensation and compromise formation, through\nsuperficial associations, under cover of contradictions, and eventually\nover the road of regression_. In view of the complete identity found\nbetween the peculiarities of the dream-work and of the psychic activity\nforming the psychoneurotic symptoms, we shall feel justified in\ntransferring to the dream the conclusions urged upon us by hysteria.\nFrom the theory of hysteria we borrow the proposition that _such an\nabnormal psychic elaboration of a normal train of thought takes place\nonly when the latter has been used for the transference of an\nunconscious wish which dates from the infantile life and is in a state\nof repression_. In accordance with this proposition we have construed\nthe theory of the dream on the assumption that the actuating dream-wish\ninvariably originates in the unconscious, which, as we ourselves have\nadmitted, cannot be universally demonstrated though it cannot be\nrefuted. But in order to explain the real meaning of the term\n_repression_, which we have employed so freely, we shall be obliged to\nmake some further addition to our psychological construction.\nWe have above elaborated the fiction of a primitive psychic apparatus,\nwhose work is regulated by the efforts to avoid accumulation of\nexcitement and as far as possible to maintain itself free from\nexcitement. For this reason it was constructed after the plan of a\nreflex apparatus; the motility, originally the path for the inner bodily\nchange, formed a discharging path standing at its disposal. We\nsubsequently discussed the psychic results of a feeling of\ngratification, and we might at the same time have introduced the second\nassumption, viz. that accumulation of excitement\u2014following certain\nmodalities that do not concern us\u2014is perceived as pain and sets the\napparatus in motion in order to reproduce a feeling of gratification in\nwhich the diminution of the excitement is perceived as pleasure. Such a\ncurrent in the apparatus which emanates from pain and strives for\npleasure we call a wish. We have said that nothing but a wish is capable\nof setting the apparatus in motion, and that the discharge of excitement\nin the apparatus is regulated automatically by the perception of\npleasure and pain. The first wish must have been an hallucinatory\noccupation of the memory for gratification. But this hallucination,\nunless it were maintained to the point of exhaustion, proved incapable\nof bringing about a cessation of the desire and consequently of securing\nthe pleasure connected with gratification.\nThus there was required a second activity\u2014in our terminology the\nactivity of a second system\u2014which should not permit the memory\noccupation to advance to perception and therefrom to restrict the\npsychic forces, but should lead the excitement emanating from the\ncraving stimulus by a devious path over the spontaneous motility which\nultimately should so change the outer world as to allow the real\nperception of the object of gratification to take place. Thus far we\nhave elaborated the plan of the psychic apparatus; these two systems are\nthe germ of the Unc. and Forec. which we include in the fully developed\napparatus.\nIn order to be in a position successfully to change the outer world\nthrough the motility, there is required the accumulation of a large sum\nof experiences in the memory systems as well as a manifold fixation of\nthe relations which are evoked in this memory material by different\nend-presentations. We now proceed further with our assumption. The\nmanifold activity of the second system, tentatively sending forth and\nretracting energy, must on the one hand have full command over all\nmemory material, but on the other hand it would be a superfluous\nexpenditure for it to send to the individual mental paths large\nquantities of energy which would thus flow off to no purpose,\ndiminishing the quantity available for the transformation of the outer\nworld. In the interests of expediency I therefore postulate that the\nsecond system succeeds in maintaining the greater part of the occupation\nenergy in a dormant state and in using but a small portion for the\npurposes of displacement. The mechanism of these processes is entirely\nunknown to me; anyone who wishes to follow up these ideas must try to\nfind the physical analogies and prepare the way for a demonstration of\nthe process of motion in the stimulation of the neuron. I merely hold to\nthe idea that the activity of the first \u03a8-system is directed _to the\nfree outflow of the quantities of excitement_, and that the second\nsystem brings about an inhibition of this outflow through the energies\nemanating from it, _i.e._ it produces a _transformation into dormant\nenergy, probably by raising the level_. I therefore assume that under\nthe control of the second system as compared with the first, the course\nof the excitement is bound to entirely different mechanical conditions.\nAfter the second system has finished its tentative mental work, it\nremoves the inhibition and congestion of the excitements and allows\nthese excitements to flow off to the motility.\nAn interesting train of thought now presents itself if we consider the\nrelations of this inhibition of discharge by the second system to the\nregulation through the principle of pain. Let us now seek the\ncounterpart of the primary feeling of gratification, namely, the\nobjective feeling of fear. A perceptive stimulus acts on the primitive\napparatus, becoming the source of a painful emotion. This will then be\nfollowed by irregular motor manifestations until one of these withdraws\nthe apparatus from perception and at the same time from pain, but on the\nreappearance of the perception this manifestation will immediately\nrepeat itself (perhaps as a movement of flight) until the perception has\nagain disappeared. But there will here remain no tendency again to\noccupy the perception of the source of pain in the form of an\nhallucination or in any other form. On the contrary, there will be a\ntendency in the primary apparatus to abandon the painful memory picture\nas soon as it is in any way awakened, as the overflow of its excitement\nwould surely produce (more precisely, begin to produce) pain. The\ndeviation from memory, which is but a repetition of the former flight\nfrom perception, is facilitated also by the fact that, unlike\nperception, memory does not possess sufficient quality to excite\nconsciousness and thereby to attract to itself new energy. This easy and\nregularly occurring deviation of the psychic process from the former\npainful memory presents to us the model and the first example of\n_psychic repression_. As is generally known, much of this deviation from\nthe painful, much of the behaviour of the ostrich, can be readily\ndemonstrated even in the normal psychic life of adults.\nBy virtue of the principle of pain the first system is therefore\naltogether incapable of introducing anything unpleasant into the mental\nassociations. The system cannot do anything but wish. If this remained\nso the mental activity of the second system, which should have at its\ndisposal all the memories stored up by experiences, would be hindered.\nBut two ways are now opened: the work of the second system either frees\nitself completely from the principle of pain and continues its course,\npaying no heed to the painful reminiscence, or it contrives to occupy\nthe painful memory in such a manner as to preclude the liberation of\npain. We may reject the first possibility, as the principle of pain also\nmanifests itself as a regulator for the emotional discharge of the\nsecond system; we are, therefore, directed to the second possibility,\nnamely, that this system occupies a reminiscence in such a manner as to\ninhibit its discharge and hence, also, to inhibit the discharge\ncomparable to a motor innervation for the development of pain. Thus from\ntwo starting points we are led to the hypothesis that occupation through\nthe second system is at the same time an inhibition for the emotional\ndischarge, viz. from a consideration of the principle of pain and from\nthe principle of the smallest expenditure of innervation. Let us,\nhowever, keep to the fact\u2014this is the key to the theory of\nrepression\u2014that the second system is capable of occupying an idea only\nwhen it is in position to check the development of pain emanating from\nit. Whatever withdraws itself from this inhibition also remains\ninaccessible for the second system and would soon be abandoned by virtue\nof the principle of pain. The inhibition of pain, however, need not be\ncomplete; it must be permitted to begin, as it indicates to the second\nsystem the nature of the memory and possibly its defective adaptation\nfor the purpose sought by the mind.\nThe psychic process which is admitted by the first system only I shall\nnow call the _primary_ process; and the one resulting from the\ninhibition of the second system I shall call the _secondary_ process. I\nshow by another point for what purpose the second system is obliged to\ncorrect the primary process. The primary process strives for a discharge\nof the excitement in order to establish a _perception_ identity with the\nsum of excitement thus gathered; the secondary process has abandoned\nthis intention and undertaken instead the task of bringing about a\n_thought identity_. All thinking is only a circuitous path from the\nmemory of gratification taken as an end-presentation to the identical\noccupation of the same memory, which is again to be attained on the\ntrack of the motor experiences. The state of thinking must take an\ninterest in the connecting paths between the presentations without\nallowing itself to be misled by their intensities. But it is obvious\nthat condensations and intermediate or compromise formations occurring\nin the presentations impede the attainment of this end-identity; by\nsubstituting one idea for the other they deviate from the path which\notherwise would have been continued from the original idea. Such\nprocesses are therefore carefully avoided in the secondary thinking. Nor\nis it difficult to understand that the principle of pain also impedes\nthe progress of the mental stream in its pursuit of the thought\nidentity, though, indeed, it offers to the mental stream the most\nimportant points of departure. Hence the tendency of the thinking\nprocess must be to free itself more and more from exclusive adjustment\nby the principle of pain, and through the working of the mind to\nrestrict the affective development to that minimum which is necessary as\na signal. This refinement of the activity must have been attained\nthrough a recent over-occupation of energy brought about by\nconsciousness. But we are aware that this refinement is seldom\ncompletely successful even in the most normal psychic life and that our\nthoughts ever remain accessible to falsification through the\ninterference of the principle of pain.\nThis, however, is not the breach in the functional efficiency of our\npsychic apparatus through which the thoughts forming the material of the\nsecondary mental work are enabled to make their way into the primary\npsychic process\u2014with which formula we may now describe the work leading\nto the dream and to the hysterical symptoms. This case of insufficiency\nresults from the union of the two factors from the history of our\nevolution; one of which belongs solely to the psychic apparatus and has\nexerted a determining influence on the relation of the two systems,\nwhile the other operates fluctuatingly and introduces motive forces of\norganic origin into the psychic life. Both originate in the infantile\nlife and result from the transformation which our psychic and somatic\norganism has undergone since the infantile period.\nWhen I termed one of the psychic processes in the psychic apparatus the\nprimary process, I did so not only in consideration of the order of\nprecedence and capability, but also as admitting the temporal relations\nto a share in the nomenclature. As far as our knowledge goes there is no\npsychic apparatus possessing only the primary process, and in so far it\nis a theoretic fiction; but so much is based on fact that the primary\nprocesses are present in the apparatus from the beginning, while the\nsecondary processes develop gradually in the course of life, inhibiting\nand covering the primary ones, and gaining complete mastery over them\nperhaps only at the height of life. Owing to this retarded appearance of\nthe secondary processes, the essence of our being, consisting in\nunconscious wish feelings, can neither be seized nor inhibited by the\nforeconscious, whose part is once for all restricted to the indication\nof the most suitable paths for the wish feelings originating in the\nunconscious. These unconscious wishes establish for all subsequent\npsychic efforts a compulsion to which they have to submit and which they\nmust strive if possible to divert from its course and direct to higher\naims. In consequence of this retardation of the foreconscious occupation\na large sphere of the memory material remains inaccessible.\nAmong these indestructible and unincumbered wish feelings originating\nfrom the infantile life, there are also some, the fulfilments of which\nhave entered into a relation of contradiction to the end-presentation of\nthe secondary thinking. The fulfilment of these wishes would no longer\nproduce an affect of pleasure but one of pain; _and it is just this\ntransformation of affect that constitutes the nature of what we\ndesignate as \u201crepression,\u201d in which we recognise the infantile first\nstep of passing adverse sentence or of rejecting through reason_. To\ninvestigate in what way and through what motive forces such a\ntransformation can be produced constitutes the problem of repression,\nwhich we need here only skim over. It will suffice to remark that such a\ntransformation of affect occurs in the course of development (one may\nthink of the appearance in infantile life of disgust which was\noriginally absent), and that it is connected with the activity of the\nsecondary system. The memories from which the unconscious wish brings\nabout the emotional discharge have never been accessible to the Forec.,\nand for that reason their emotional discharge cannot be inhibited. It is\njust on account of this affective development that these ideas are not\neven now accessible to the foreconscious thoughts to which they have\ntransferred their wishing power. On the contrary, the principle of pain\ncomes into play, and causes the Forec. to deviate from these thoughts of\ntransference. The latter, left to themselves, are \u201crepressed,\u201d and thus\nthe existence of a store of infantile memories, from the very beginning\nwithdrawn from the Forec., becomes the preliminary condition of\nrepression.\nIn the most favourable case the development of pain terminates as soon\nas the energy has been withdrawn from the thoughts of transference in\nthe Forec., and this effect characterises the intervention of the\nprinciple of pain as expedient. It is different, however, if the\nrepressed unconscious wish receives an organic enforcement which it can\nlend to its thoughts of transference and through which it can enable\nthem to make an effort towards penetration with their excitement, even\nafter they have been abandoned by the occupation of the Forec. A\ndefensive struggle then ensues, inasmuch as the Forec. reinforces the\nantagonism against the repressed ideas, and subsequently this leads to a\npenetration by the thoughts of transference (the carriers of the\nunconscious wish) in some form of compromise through symptom formation.\nBut from the moment that the suppressed thoughts are powerfully occupied\nby the unconscious wish-feeling and abandoned by the foreconscious\noccupation, they succumb to the primary psychic process and strive only\nfor motor discharge; or, if the path be free, for hallucinatory revival\nof the desired perception identity. We have previously found,\nempirically, that the incorrect processes described are enacted only\nwith thoughts that exist in the repression. We now grasp another part of\nthe connection. These incorrect processes are those that are primary in\nthe psychic apparatus; _they appear wherever thoughts abandoned by the\nforeconscious occupation are left to themselves, and can fill themselves\nwith the uninhibited energy, striving for discharge from the\nunconscious_. We may add a few further observations to support the view\nthat these processes designated \u201cincorrect\u201d are really not\nfalsifications of the normal defective thinking, but the modes of\nactivity of the psychic apparatus when freed from inhibition. Thus we\nsee that the transference of the foreconscious excitement to the\nmotility takes place according to the same processes, and that the\nconnection of the foreconscious presentations with words readily\nmanifest the same displacements and mixtures which are described to\ninattention. Finally, I should like to adduce proof that an increase of\nwork necessarily results from the inhibition of these primary courses\nfrom the fact that we gain a _comical effect_, a surplus to be\ndischarged through laughter, _if we allow these streams of thought to\ncome to consciousness_.\nThe theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with complete certainty that\nonly sexual wish-feelings from the infantile life experience repression\n(emotional transformation) during the developmental period of childhood.\nThese are capable of returning to activity at a later period of\ndevelopment, and then have the faculty of being revived, either as a\nconsequence of the sexual constitution, which is really formed from the\noriginal bisexuality, or in consequence of unfavourable influences of\nthe sexual life; and they thus supply the motive power for all\npsychoneurotic symptom formations. It is only by the introduction of\nthese sexual forces that the gaps still demonstrable in the theory of\nrepression can be filled. I will leave it undecided whether the\npostulate of the sexual and infantile may also be asserted for the\ntheory of the dream; I leave this here unfinished because I have already\npassed a step beyond the demonstrable in assuming that the dream-wish\ninvariably originates from the unconscious.[FY] Nor will I further\ninvestigate the difference in the play of the psychic forces in the\ndream formation and in the formation of the hysterical symptoms, for to\ndo this we ought to possess a more explicit knowledge of one of the\nmembers to be compared. But I regard another point as important, and\nwill here confess that it was on account of this very point that I have\njust undertaken this entire discussion concerning the two psychic\nsystems, their modes of operation, and the repression. For it is now\nimmaterial whether I have conceived the psychological relations in\nquestion with approximate correctness, or, as is easily possible in such\na difficult matter, in an erroneous and fragmentary manner. Whatever\nchanges may be made in the interpretation of the psychic censor and of\nthe correct and of the abnormal elaboration of the dream content, the\nfact nevertheless remains that such processes are active in dream\nformation, and that essentially they show the closest analogy to the\nprocesses observed in the formation of the hysterical symptoms. The\ndream is not a pathological phenomenon, and it does not leave behind an\nenfeeblement of the mental faculties. The objection that no deduction\ncan be drawn regarding the dreams of healthy persons from my own dreams\nand from those of neurotic patients may be rejected without comment.\nHence, when we draw conclusions from the phenomena as to their motive\nforces, we recognise that the psychic mechanism made use of by the\nneuroses is not created by a morbid disturbance of the psychic life, but\nis found ready in the normal structure of the psychic apparatus. The two\npsychic systems, the censor crossing between them, the inhibition and\nthe covering of the one activity by the other, the relations of both to\nconsciousness\u2014or whatever may offer a more correct interpretation of the\nactual conditions in their stead\u2014all these belong to the normal\nstructure of our psychic instrument, and the dream points out for us one\nof the roads leading to a knowledge of this structure. If, in addition\nto our knowledge, we wish to be contented with a minimum perfectly\nestablished, we shall say that the dream gives us proof that the\n_suppressed material continues to exist even in the normal person and\nremains capable of psychic activity_. The dream itself is one of the\nmanifestations of this suppressed material; theoretically, this is true\nin _all_ cases; according to substantial experience it is true in at\nleast a great number of such as most conspicuously display the prominent\ncharacteristics of dream life. The suppressed psychic material, which in\nthe waking state has been prevented from expression and cut off from\ninternal perception _by the antagonistic adjustment of the\ncontradictions_, finds ways and means of obtruding itself on\nconsciousness during the night under the domination of the compromise\nformations.\n\u201c_Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo._\u201d\nAt any rate the interpretation of dreams is the _via regia_ to a\nknowledge of the unconscious in the psychic life.\nIn following the analysis of the dream we have made some progress toward\nan understanding of the composition of this most marvellous and most\nmysterious of instruments; to be sure, we have not gone very far, but\nenough of a beginning has been made to allow us to advance from other\nso-called pathological formations further into the analysis of the\nunconscious. Disease\u2014at least that which is justly termed functional\u2014is\nnot due to the destruction of this apparatus, and the establishment of\nnew splittings in its interior; it is rather to be explained dynamically\nthrough the strengthening and weakening of the components in the play of\nforces by which so many activities are concealed during the normal\nfunction. We have been able to show in another place how the composition\nof the apparatus from the two systems permits a subtilisation even of\nthe normal activity which would be impossible for a single system.[FZ]\n(_f_) _The Unconscious and Consciousness\u2014Reality._\nOn closer inspection we find that it is not the existence of two systems\nnear the motor end of the apparatus but of two kinds of processes or\nmodes of emotional discharge, the assumption of which was explained in\nthe psychological discussions of the previous chapter. This can make no\ndifference for us, for we must always be ready to drop our auxiliary\nideas whenever we deem ourselves in position to replace them by\nsomething else approaching more closely to the unknown reality. Let us\nnow try to correct some views which might be erroneously formed as long\nas we regarded the two systems in the crudest and most obvious sense as\ntwo localities within the psychic apparatus, views which have left their\ntraces in the terms \u201crepression\u201d and \u201cpenetration.\u201d Thus, when we say\nthat an unconscious idea strives for transference into the foreconscious\nin order later to penetrate consciousness, we do not mean that a second\nidea is to be formed situated in a new locality like an interlineation\nnear which the original continues to remain; also, when we speak of\npenetration into consciousness, we wish carefully to avoid any idea of\nchange of locality. When we say that a foreconscious idea is repressed\nand subsequently taken up by the unconscious, we might be tempted by\nthese figures, borrowed from the idea of a struggle over a territory, to\nassume that an arrangement is really broken up in one psychic locality\nand replaced by a new one in the other locality. For these comparisons\nwe substitute what would seem to correspond better with the real state\nof affairs by saying that an energy occupation is displaced to or\nwithdrawn from a certain arrangement so that the psychic formation falls\nunder the domination of a system or is withdrawn from the same. Here\nagain we replace a topical mode of presentation by a dynamic; it is not\nthe psychic formation that appears to us as the moving factor but the\ninnervation of the same.\nI deem it appropriate and justifiable, however, to apply ourselves still\nfurther to the illustrative conception of the two systems. We shall\navoid any misapplication of this manner of representation if we remember\nthat presentations, thoughts, and psychic formations should generally\nnot be localised in the organic elements of the nervous system, but, so\nto speak, between them, where resistances and paths form the correlate\ncorresponding to them. Everything that can become an object of our\ninternal perception is virtual, like the image in the telescope produced\nby the passage of the rays of light. But we are justified in assuming\nthe existence of the systems, which have nothing psychic in themselves\nand which never become accessible to our psychic perception,\ncorresponding to the lenses of the telescope which design the image. If\nwe continue this comparison, we may say that the censor between two\nsystems corresponds to the refraction of rays during their passage into\na new medium.\nThus far we have made psychology on our own responsibility; it is now\ntime to examine the theoretical opinions governing present-day\npsychology and to test their relation to our theories. The question of\nthe unconscious in psychology is, according to the authoritative words\nof Lipps,[GA] less a psychological question than the question of\npsychology. As long as psychology settled this question with the verbal\nexplanation that the \u201cpsychic\u201d is the \u201cconscious\u201d and that \u201cunconscious\npsychic occurrences\u201d are an obvious contradiction, a psychological\nestimate of the observations gained by the physician from abnormal\nmental states was precluded. The physician and the philosopher agree\nonly when both acknowledge that unconscious psychic processes are \u201cthe\nappropriate and well-justified expression for an established fact.\u201d The\nphysician cannot but reject with a shrug of his shoulders the assertion\nthat \u201cconsciousness is the indispensable quality of the psychic\u201d; he may\nassume, if his respect for the utterings of the philosophers still be\nstrong enough, that he and they do not treat the same subject and do not\npursue the same science. For a single intelligent observation of the\npsychic life of a neurotic, a single analysis of a dream must force upon\nhim the unalterable conviction that the most complicated and correct\nmental operations, to which no one will refuse the name of psychic\noccurrences, may take place without exciting the consciousness of the\nperson. It is true that the physician does not learn of these\nunconscious processes until they have exerted such an effect on\nconsciousness as to admit communication or observation. But this effect\nof consciousness may show a psychic character widely differing from the\nunconscious process, so that the internal perception cannot possibly\nrecognise the one as a substitute for the other. The physician must\nreserve for himself the right to penetrate, by a process of deduction,\nfrom the effect on consciousness to the unconscious psychic process; he\nlearns in this way that the effect on consciousness is only a remote\npsychic product of the unconscious process and that the latter has not\nbecome conscious as such; that it has been in existence and operative\nwithout betraying itself in any way to consciousness.\nA reaction from the over-estimation of the quality of consciousness\nbecomes the indispensable preliminary condition for any correct insight\ninto the behaviour of the psychic. In the words of Lipps, the\nunconscious must be accepted as the general basis of the psychic life.\nThe unconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself the\nsmaller circle of the conscious; everything conscious has its\npreliminary step in the unconscious, whereas the unconscious may stop\nwith this step and still claim full value as a psychic activity.\nProperly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; _its inner\nnature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world,\nand it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of\nconsciousness as is the external world through the indications of our\nsensory organs_.\nA series of dream problems which have intensely occupied older authors\nwill be laid aside when the old opposition between conscious life and\ndream life is abandoned and the unconscious psychic assigned to its\nproper place. Thus many of the activities whose performances in the\ndream have excited our admiration are now no longer to be attributed to\nthe dream but to unconscious thinking, which is also active during the\nday. If, according to Scherner, the dream seems to play with a\nsymbolising representation of the body, we know that this is the work of\ncertain unconscious phantasies which have probably given in to sexual\nemotions, and that these phantasies come to expression not only in\ndreams but also in hysterical phobias and in other symptoms. If the\ndream continues and settles activities of the day and even brings to\nlight valuable inspirations, we have only to subtract from it the dream\ndisguise as a feat of dream-work and a mark of assistance from obscure\nforces in the depth of the mind (_cf._ the devil in Tartini\u2019s sonata\ndream). The intellectual task as such must be attributed to the same\npsychic forces which perform all such tasks during the day. We are\nprobably far too much inclined to over-estimate the conscious character\neven of intellectual and artistic productions. From the communications\nof some of the most highly productive persons, such as Goethe and\nHelmholtz, we learn, indeed, that the most essential and original parts\nin their creations came to them in the form of inspirations and reached\ntheir perceptions almost finished. There is nothing strange about the\nassistance of the conscious activity in other cases where there was a\nconcerted effort of all the psychic forces. But it is a much abused\nprivilege of the conscious activity that it is allowed to hide from us\nall other activities wherever it participates.\nIt will hardly be worth while to take up the historical significance of\ndreams as a special subject. Where, for instance, a chieftain has been\nurged through a dream to engage in a bold undertaking the success of\nwhich has had the effect of changing history, a new problem results only\nso long as the dream, regarded as a strange power, is contrasted with\nother more familiar psychic forces; the problem, however, disappears\nwhen we regard the dream as a form of expression for feelings which are\nburdened with resistance during the day and which can receive\nreinforcements at night from deep emotional sources.[GB] But the great\nrespect shown by the ancients for the dream is based on a correct\npsychological surmise. It is a homage paid to the unsubdued and\nindestructible in the human mind, and to the demoniacal which furnishes\nthe dream-wish and which we find again in our unconscious.\nNot inadvisedly do I use the expression \u201cin our unconscious,\u201d for what\nwe so designate does not coincide with the unconscious of the\nphilosophers, nor with the unconscious of Lipps. In the latter uses it\nis intended to designate only the opposite of conscious. That there are\nalso unconscious psychic processes beside the conscious ones is the\nhotly contested and energetically defended issue. Lipps gives us the\nmore far-reaching theory that everything psychic exists as unconscious,\nbut that some of it may exist also as conscious. But it was not to prove\nthis theory that we have adduced the phenomena of the dream and of the\nhysterical symptom formation; the observation of normal life alone\nsuffices to establish its correctness beyond any doubt. The new fact\nthat we have learned from the analysis of the psychopathological\nformations, and indeed from their first member, viz. dreams, is that the\nunconscious\u2014hence the psychic\u2014occurs as a function of two separate\nsystems and that it occurs as such even in normal psychic life.\nConsequently there are two kinds of unconscious, which we do not as yet\nfind distinguished by the psychologists. Both are unconscious in the\npsychological sense; but in our sense the first, which we call Unc., is\nlikewise incapable of consciousness, whereas the second we term \u201cForec.\u201d\nbecause its emotions, after the observance of certain rules, can reach\nconsciousness, perhaps not before they have again undergone censorship,\nbut still regardless of the Unc. system. The fact that in order to\nattain consciousness the emotions must traverse an unalterable series of\nevents or succession of instances, as is betrayed through their\nalteration by the censor, has helped us to draw a comparison from\nspatiality. We described the relations of the two systems to each other\nand to consciousness by saying that the system Forec. is like a screen\nbetween the system Unc. and consciousness. The system Forec. not only\nbars access to consciousness, but also controls the entrance to\nvoluntary motility and is capable of sending out a sum of mobile energy,\na portion of which is familiar to us as attention.\nWe must also steer clear of the distinctions superconscious and\nsubconscious which have found so much favour in the more recent\nliterature on the psychoneuroses, for just such a distinction seems to\nemphasize the equivalence of the psychic and the conscious.\nWhat part now remains in our description of the once all-powerful and\nall-overshadowing consciousness? None other than that of a sensory organ\nfor the perception of psychic qualities. According to the fundamental\nidea of schematic undertaking we can conceive the conscious perception\nonly as the particular activity of an independent system for which the\nabbreviated designation \u201cCons.\u201d commends itself. This system we conceive\nto be similar in its mechanical characteristics to the perception system\nP, hence excitable by qualities and incapable of retaining the trace of\nchanges, _i.e._ it is devoid of memory. The psychic apparatus which,\nwith the sensory organs of the P-systems, is turned to the outer world,\nis itself the outer world for the sensory organ of Cons.; the\nteleological justification of which rests on this relationship. We are\nhere once more confronted with the principle of the succession of\ninstances which seems to dominate the structure of the apparatus. The\nmaterial under excitement flows to the Cons. sensory organ from two\nsides, firstly from the P-system whose excitement, qualitatively\ndetermined, probably experiences a new elaboration until it comes to\nconscious perception; and, secondly, from the interior of the apparatus\nitself, the quantitative processes of which are perceived as a\nqualitative series of pleasure and pain as soon as they have undergone\ncertain changes.\nThe philosophers, who have learned that correct and highly complicated\nthought structures are possible even without the co-operation of\nconsciousness, have found it difficult to attribute any function to\nconsciousness; it has appeared to them a superfluous mirroring of the\nperfected psychic process. The analogy of our Cons. system with the\nsystems of perception relieves us of this embarrassment. We see that\nperception through our sensory organs results in directing the\noccupation of attention to those paths on which the incoming sensory\nexcitement is diffused; the qualitative excitement of the P-system\nserves the mobile quantity of the psychic apparatus as a regulator for\nits discharge. We may claim the same function for the overlying sensory\norgan of the Cons. system. By assuming new qualities, it furnishes a new\ncontribution toward the guidance and suitable distribution of the mobile\noccupation quantities. By means of the perceptions of pleasure and pain,\nit influences the course of the occupations within the psychic\napparatus, which normally operates unconsciously and through the\ndisplacement of quantities. It is probable that the principle of pain\nfirst regulates the displacements of occupation automatically, but it is\nquite possible that the consciousness of these qualities adds a second\nand more subtle regulation which may even oppose the first and perfect\nthe working capacity of the apparatus by placing it in a position\ncontrary to its original design for occupying and developing even that\nwhich is connected with the liberation of pain. We learn from\nneuropsychology that an important part in the functional activity of the\napparatus is attributed to such regulations through the qualitative\nexcitation of the sensory organs. The automatic control of the primary\nprinciple of pain and the restriction of mental capacity connected with\nit are broken by the sensible regulations, which in their turn are again\nautomatisms. We learn that the repression which, though originally\nexpedient, terminates nevertheless in a harmful rejection of inhibition\nand of psychic domination, is so much more easily accomplished with\nreminiscences than with perceptions, because in the former there is no\nincrease in occupation through the excitement of the psychic sensory\norgans. When an idea to be rejected has once failed to become conscious\nbecause it has succumbed to repression, it can be repressed on other\noccasions only because it has been withdrawn from conscious perception\non other grounds. These are hints employed by therapy in order to bring\nabout a retrogression of accomplished repressions.\nThe value of the over-occupation which is produced by the regulating\ninfluence of the Cons. sensory organ on the mobile quantity, is\ndemonstrated in the teleological connection by nothing more clearly than\nby the creation of a new series of qualities and consequently a new\nregulation which constitutes the precedence of man over the animals. For\nthe mental processes are in themselves devoid of quality except for the\nexcitements of pleasure and pain accompanying them, which, as we know,\nare to be held in check as possible disturbances of thought. In order to\nendow them with a quality, they are associated in man with verbal\nmemories, the qualitative remnants of which suffice to draw upon them\nthe attention of consciousness which in turn endows thought with a new\nmobile energy.\nThe manifold problems of consciousness in their entirety can be examined\nonly through an analysis of the hysterical mental process. From this\nanalysis we receive the impression that the transition from the\nforeconscious to the occupation of consciousness is also connected with\na censorship similar to the one between the Unc. and the Forec. This\ncensorship, too, begins to act only with the reaching of a certain\nquantitative degree, so that few intense thought formations escape it.\nEvery possible case of detention from consciousness, as well as of\npenetration to consciousness, under restriction is found included within\nthe picture of the psychoneurotic phenomena; every case points to the\nintimate and two-fold connection between the censor and consciousness. I\nshall conclude these psychological discussions with the report of two\nsuch occurrences.\nOn the occasion of a consultation a few years ago the subject was an\nintelligent and innocent-looking girl. Her attire was strange; whereas a\nwoman\u2019s garb is usually groomed to the last fold, she had one of her\nstockings hanging down and two of her waist buttons opened. She\ncomplained of pains in one of her legs, and exposed her leg unrequested.\nHer chief complaint, however, was in her own words as follows: She had a\nfeeling in her body as if something was stuck into it which moved to and\nfro and made her tremble through and through. This sometimes made her\nwhole body stiff. On hearing this, my colleague in consultation looked\nat me; the complaint was quite plain to him. To both of us it seemed\npeculiar that the patient\u2019s mother thought nothing of the matter; of\ncourse she herself must have been repeatedly in the situation described\nby her child. As for the girl, she had no idea of the import of her\nwords or she would never have allowed them to pass her lips. Here the\ncensor had been deceived so successfully that under the mask of an\ninnocent complaint a phantasy was admitted to consciousness which\notherwise would have remained in the foreconscious.\nAnother example: I began the psychoanalytic treatment of a boy of\nfourteen years who was suffering from _tic convulsif_, hysterical\nvomiting, headache, &c., by assuring him that, after closing his eyes,\nhe would see pictures or have ideas, which I requested him to\ncommunicate to me. He answered by describing pictures. The last\nimpression he had received before coming to me was visually revived in\nhis memory. He had played a game of checkers with his uncle, and now saw\nthe checker-board before him. He commented on various positions that\nwere favourable or unfavourable, on moves that were not safe to make. He\nthen saw a dagger lying on the checker-board, an object belonging to his\nfather, but transferred to the checker-board by his phantasy. Then a\nsickle was lying on the board; next a scythe was added; and, finally, he\nbeheld the likeness of an old peasant mowing the grass in front of the\nboy\u2019s distant parental home. A few days later I discovered the meaning\nof this series of pictures. Disagreeable family relations had made the\nboy nervous. It was the case of a strict and crabbed father who lived\nunhappily with his mother, and whose educational methods consisted in\nthreats; of the separation of his father from his tender and delicate\nmother, and the remarrying of his father, who one day brought home a\nyoung woman as his new mamma. The illness of the fourteen-year-old boy\nbroke out a few days later. It was the suppressed anger against his\nfather that had composed these pictures into intelligible allusions. The\nmaterial was furnished by a reminiscence from mythology. The sickle was\nthe one with which Zeus castrated his father; the scythe and the\nlikeness of the peasant represented Kronos, the violent old man who eats\nhis children and upon whom Zeus wreaks vengeance in so unfilial a\nmanner. The marriage of the father gave the boy an opportunity to return\nthe reproaches and threats of his father\u2014which had previously been made\nbecause the child played with his genitals (the checker-board; the\nprohibitive moves; the dagger with which a person may be killed). We\nhave here long repressed memories and their unconscious remnants which,\nunder the guise of senseless pictures have slipped into consciousness by\ndevious paths left open to them.\nI should then expect to find the theoretical value of the study of\ndreams in its contribution to psychological knowledge and in its\npreparation for an understanding of neuroses. Who can foresee the\nimportance of a thorough knowledge of the structure and activities of\nthe psychic apparatus when even our present state of knowledge produces\na happy therapeutic influence in the curable forms of the\npsychoneuroses? What about the practical value of such study someone may\nask, for psychic knowledge and for the discovering of the secret\npeculiarities of individual character? Have not the unconscious feelings\nrevealed by the dream the value of real forces in the psychic life?\nShould we take lightly the ethical significance of the suppressed wishes\nwhich, as they now create dreams, may some day create other things?\nI do not feel justified in answering these questions. I have not thought\nfurther upon this side of the dream problem. I believe, however, that at\nall events the Roman Emperor was in the wrong who ordered one of his\nsubjects executed because the latter dreamt that he had killed the\nEmperor. He should first have endeavoured to discover the significance\nof the dream; most probably it was not what it seemed to be. And even if\na dream of different content had the significance of this offence\nagainst majesty, it would still have been in place to remember the words\nof Plato, that the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that\nwhich the wicked man does in actual life. I am therefore of the opinion\nthat it is best to accord freedom to dreams. Whether any reality is to\nbe attributed to the unconscious wishes, and in what sense, I am not\nprepared to say offhand. Reality must naturally be denied to all\ntransition\u2014and intermediate thoughts. If we had before us the\nunconscious wishes, brought to their last and truest expression, we\nshould still do well to remember that more than one single form of\nexistence must be ascribed to the psychic reality. Action and the\nconscious expression of thought mostly suffice for the practical need of\njudging a man\u2019s character. Action, above all, merits to be placed in the\nfirst rank; for many of the impulses penetrating consciousness are\nneutralised by real forces of the psychic life before they are converted\ninto action; indeed, the reason why they frequently do not encounter any\npsychic obstacle on their way is because the unconscious is certain of\ntheir meeting with resistances later. In any case it is instructive to\nbecome familiar with the much raked-up soil from which our virtues\nproudly arise. For the complication of human character moving\ndynamically in all directions very rarely accommodates itself to\nadjustment through a simple alternative, as our antiquated moral\nphilosophy would have it.\nAnd how about the value of the dream for a knowledge of the future?\nThat, of course, we cannot consider.[GC] One feels inclined to\nsubstitute: \u201cfor a knowledge of the past.\u201d For the dream originates from\nthe past in every sense. To be sure the ancient belief that the dream\nreveals the future is not entirely devoid of truth. By representing to\nus a wish as fulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the future; but\nthis future, taken by the dreamer as present, has been formed into the\nlikeness of that past by the indestructible wish.\nVIII\nLITERARY INDEX\nFootnote 1:\nAristoteles. _\u00dcber Tr\u00e4ume und Traumdeutungen._ Translated by Bender.\nFootnote 2:\nArtemidoros aus Daldis. _Symbolik der Tr\u00e4ume._ Translated by\nFriedrich.

Gruppe, _Griechische Mythologie und\nReligionsgeschichte_, p. 390. \u201cDreams were divided into two classes;\nthe first were influenced only by the present (or past), and were\nunimportant for the future: they embraced the \u1f10\u03bd\u03cd\u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, insomnia, which\nimmediately produces the given idea or its opposite, _e.g._ hunger or\nits satiation, and the \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, which elaborates the given idea\nphantastically, as _e.g._ the nightmare, ephialtes. The second class\nwas, on the other hand, determinant for the future. To this belong:\n(1) direct prophecies received in the dream (\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, oraculum);\n(2) the foretelling of a future event (\u1f45\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1); (3) the symbolic or the\ndream requiring interpretation (\u1f44\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, somnium). This theory has\nbeen preserved for many centuries.\u201d\nFootnote F:\nFrom subsequent experience I am able to state that it is not at all\nrare to find in dreams repetitions of harmless or unimportant\noccupations of the waking state, such as packing trunks, preparing\nfood, work in the kitchen, &c., but in such dreams the dreamer himself\nemphasizes not the character but the reality of the memory, \u201cI have\nreally done all this in the day time.\u201d\nFootnote G:\n_Chauffeurs_ were bands of robbers in the Vend\u00e9e who resorted to this\nform of torture.\nFootnote H:\nGigantic persons in a dream justify the assumption that it deals with\na scene from the dreamer\u2019s childhood.\nFootnote I:\nThe first volume of this Norwegian author, containing a complete\ndescription of dreams, has recently appeared in German. See Index of\nLiterature, No. [74a].\nFootnote J:\nPeriodically recurrent dreams have been observed repeatedly. _Cf._ the\ncollection of Chabaneix.[11]\nFootnote K:\nSilberer has shown by nice examples how in the state of sleepiness\neven abstract thoughts may be changed into illustrative plastic\npictures which express the same thing (_Jahrbuch_ von Bleuler-Freud,\nvol. i. 1900).\nFootnote L:\nHaffner[32] made an attempt similar to Delb\u0153uf\u2019s to explain the dream\nactivity on the basis of an alteration which must result in an\nintroduction of an abnormal condition in the otherwise correct\nfunction of the intact psychic apparatus, but he described this\ncondition in somewhat different words. He states that the first\ndistinguishing mark of the dream is the absence of time and space,\n_i.e._ the emancipation of the presentation from the position in the\norder of time and space which is common to the individual. Allied to\nthis is the second fundamental character of the dream, the mistaking\nof the hallucinations, imaginations, and phantasy-combinations for\nobjective perceptions. The sum total of the higher psychic forces,\nespecially formation of ideas, judgment, and argumentation on the one\nhand, and the free self-determination on the other hand, connect\nthemselves with the sensory phantasy pictures and at all times have\nthem as a substratum. These activities too, therefore, participate in\nthe irregularity of the dream presentation. We say they participate,\nfor our faculties of judgment and will power are in themselves in no\nway altered during sleep. In reference to activity, we are just as\nkeen and just as free as in the waking state. A man cannot act\ncontrary to the laws of thought, even in the dream, _i.e._ he is\nunable to harmonise with that which represents itself as contrary to\nhim, &c.; he can only desire in the dream that which he presents to\nhimself as good (_sub ratione boni_). But in this application of the\nlaws of thinking and willing the human mind is led astray in the dream\nthrough mistaking one presentation for another. It thus happens that\nwe form and commit in the dream the greatest contradictions, while, on\nthe other hand, we display the keenest judgments and the most\nconsequential chains of reasoning, and can make the most virtuous and\nsacred resolutions. Lack of orientation is the whole secret of the\nflight by which our phantasy moves in the dream, and lack of critical\nreflection and mutual understanding with others is the main source of\nthe reckless extravagances of our judgments, hopes, and wishes in the\ndream (p. 18).\nFootnote M:\n_Cf._ Haffner[32] and Spitta[64].\nFootnote N:\n_Grundz\u00fcge des Systems der Anthropologie._ Erlangen, 1850 (quoted by\nSpitta).\nFootnote O:\n_Das Traumleben und seine Deutung_, 1868 (cited by Spitta, p. 192).\nFootnote P:\nH. Swoboda, _Die Perioden des Menschlichen Organismus_, 1904.\nFootnote Q:\nIn a novel, _Gradiva_, of the poet W. Jensen, I accidentally\ndiscovered several artificial dreams which were formed with perfect\ncorrectness and which could be interpreted as though they had not been\ninvented, but had been dreamt by actual persons. The poet declared,\nupon my inquiry, that he was unacquainted with my theory of dreams. I\nhave made use of this correspondence between my investigation and the\ncreative work of the poet as a proof of the correctness of my method\nof dream analysis (\u201cDer Wahn und die Tr\u00e4ume,\u201d in W. Jensen\u2019s\n_Gradiva_, No. 1 of the _Schriften zur angewandten Seelenkunde_, 1906,\nedited by me). Dr. Alfred Robitsek has since shown that the dream of\nthe hero in Goethe\u2019s _Egmont_ may be interpreted as correctly as an\nactually experienced dream (\u201cDie Analyse von Egmont\u2019s Tr\u00e4ume,\u201d\n_Jahrbuch_, edited by Bleuler-Freud, vol. ii., 1910.)\nFootnote R:\nAfter the completion of my manuscript, a paper by Stumpf[65] came to\nmy notice which agrees with my work in attempting to prove that the\ndream is full of meaning and capable of interpretation. But the\ninterpretation is undertaken by means of an allegorising symbolism,\nwithout warrant for the universal applicability of the procedure.\nFootnote S:\nDr. Alfred Robitsek calls my attention to the fact that Oriental dream\nbooks, of which ours are pitiful plagiarisms, undertake the\ninterpretation of dream elements, mostly according to the assonance\nand similarity of the words. Since these relationships must be lost by\ntranslation into our language, the incomprehensibility of the\nsubstitutions in our popular \u201cdream books\u201d may have its origin in this\nfact. Information as to the extraordinary significance of puns and\npunning in ancient Oriental systems of culture may be found in the\nwritings of Hugo Winckler. The nicest example of a dream\ninterpretation which has come down to us from antiquity is based on a\nplay upon words. Artemidoros[2] relates the following (p. 225): \u201cIt\nseems to me that Aristandros gives a happy interpretation to Alexander\nof Macedon. When the latter held Tyros shut in and in a state of\nsiege, and was angry and depressed over the great loss of time, he\ndreamed that he saw a Satyros dancing on his shield. It happened that\nAristandros was near Tyros and in the convoy of the king, who was\nwaging war on the Syrians. By disjoining the word Satyros into \u03c3\u03b1 and\n\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, he induced the king to become more aggressive in the siege, and\nthus he became master of the city. (\u03a3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u2014thine is Tyros.) The\ndream, indeed, is so intimately connected with verbal expression that\nFerenczi[87] may justly remark that every tongue has its own dream\nlanguage. Dreams are, as a rule, not translatable into other\nlanguages.\u201d\nFootnote T:\nBreuer and Freud, _Studien \u00fcber Hysterie_, Vienna, 1895; 2nd ed. 1909.\nFootnote U:\nThe complaint, as yet unexplained, of pains in the abdomen, may also\nbe referred to this third person. It is my own wife, of course, who is\nin question; the abdominal pains remind me of one of the occasions\nupon which her shyness became evident to me. I must myself admit that\nI do not treat Irma and my wife very gallantly in this dream, but let\nit be said for my excuse that I am judging both of them by the\nstandard of the courageous, docile, female patient.\nFootnote V:\nI suspect that the interpretation of this portion has not been carried\nfar enough to follow every hidden meaning. If I were to continue the\ncomparison of the three women, I would go far afield. Every dream has\nat least one point at which it is unfathomable, a central point, as it\nwere, connecting it with the unknown.\nFootnote W:\n\u201cAnanas,\u201d moreover, has a remarkable assonance to the family name of\nmy patient Irma.\nFootnote X:\nIn this the dream did not turn out to be prophetic. But in another\nsense, it proved correct, for the \u201cunsolved\u201d stomach pains, for which\nI did not want to be to blame, were the forerunners of a serious\nillness caused by gall stones.\nFootnote Y:\nEven if I have not, as may be understood, given account of everything\nwhich occurred to me in connection with the work of interpretation.\nFootnote Z:\nThe facts about dreams of thirst were known also to Weygandt,[75] who\nexpresses himself about them (p. 11) as follows: \u201cIt is just the\nsensation of thirst which is most accurately registered of all; it\nalways causes a representation of thirst quenching. The manner in\nwhich the dream pictures the act of thirst quenching is manifold, and\nis especially apt to be formed according to a recent reminiscence.\nHere also a universal phenomenon is that disappointment in the slight\nefficacy of the supposed refreshments sets in immediately after the\nidea that thirst has been quenched.\u201d But he overlooks the fact that\nthe reaction of the dream to the stimulus is universal. If other\npersons who are troubled by thirst at night awake without dreaming\nbeforehand, this does not constitute an objection to my experiment,\nbut characterises those others as persons who sleep poorly.\nFootnote AA:\nThe dream afterwards accomplished the same purpose in the case of the\ngrandmother, who is older than the child by about seventy years, as it\ndid in the case of the granddaughter. After she had been forced to go\nhungry for several days on account of the restlessness of her floating\nkidney, she dreamed, apparently with a transference into the happy\ntime of her flowering maidenhood, that she had been \u201casked out,\u201d\ninvited as a guest for both the important meals, and each time had\nbeen served with the most delicious morsels.\nFootnote AB:\nA more searching investigation into the psychic life of the child\nteaches us, to be sure, that sexual motive powers in infantile forms,\nwhich have been too long overlooked, play a sufficiently great part in\nthe psychic activity of the child. This raises some doubt as to the\nhappiness of the child, as imagined later by the adults. _Cf._ the\nauthor\u2019s \u201cThree Contributions to the Sexual Theory,\u201d translated by A.\nA. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_ Publishing Company.\nFootnote AC:\nIt should not be left unmentioned that children sometimes show complex\nand more obscure dreams, while, on the other hand, adults will often\nunder certain conditions show dreams of an infantile character. How\nrich in unsuspected material the dreams of children of from four to\nfive years might be is shown by examples in my \u201cAnalyse der Phobie\neines f\u00fcnfj\u00e4hrigen Knaben\u201d (_Jahrbuch_, ed. by Bleuler & Freud, 1909),\nand in Jung\u2019s \u201cUeber Konflikte der kindlichen Seele\u201d (ebda. ii. vol.,\n1910). On the other hand, it seems that dreams of an infantile type\nreappear especially often in adults if they are transferred to unusual\nconditions of life. Thus Otto Nordenskjold, in his book _Antarctic_\n(1904), writes as follows about the crew who passed the winter with\nhim. \u201cVery characteristic for the trend of our inmost thoughts were\nour dreams, which were never more vivid and numerous than at present.\nEven those of our comrades with whom dreaming had formerly been an\nexception had long stories to tell in the morning when we exchanged\nour experiences in the world of phantasies. They all referred to that\nouter world which was now so far from us, but they often fitted into\nour present relations. An especially characteristic dream was the one\nin which one of our comrades believed himself back on the bench at\nschool, where the task was assigned him of skinning miniature seals\nwhich were especially made for the purposes of instruction. Eating and\ndrinking formed the central point around which most of our dreams were\ngrouped. One of us, who was fond of going to big dinner parties at\nnight, was exceedingly glad if he could report in the morning \u2018that he\nhad had a dinner consisting of three courses.\u2019 Another dreamed of\ntobacco\u2014of whole mountains of tobacco; still another dreamed of a ship\napproaching on the open sea under full sail. Still another dream\ndeserves to be mentioned. The letter carrier brought the mail, and\ngave a long explanation of why he had had to wait so long for it; he\nhad delivered it at the wrong place, and only after great effort had\nbeen able to get it back. To be sure, we occupied ourselves in sleep\nwith still more impossible things, but the lack of phantasy in almost\nall the dreams which I myself dreamed or heard others relate was quite\nstriking. It would surely have been of great psychological interest if\nall the dreams could have been noted. But one can readily understand\nhow we longed for sleep. It alone could afford us everything that we\nall most ardently desired.\u201d\nFootnote AD:\nA Hungarian proverb referred to by Ferenczi[87] states more explicitly\nthat \u201cthe pig dreams of acorns, the goose of maize.\u201d\nFootnote AE:\nIt is quite incredible with what stubbornness readers and critics\nexclude this consideration, and leave unheeded the fundamental\ndifferentiation between the manifest and the latent dream content.\nFootnote AF:\nIt is remarkable how my memory narrows here for the purposes of\nanalysis\u2014while I am awake. I have known five of my uncles, and have\nloved and honoured one of them. But at the moment when I overcame my\nresistance to the interpretation of the dream I said to myself, \u201cI\nhave only one uncle, the one who is intended in the dream.\u201d\nFootnote AG:\nThe word is here used in the original Latin sense _instantia_, meaning\nenergy, continuance or persistence in doing. (Translator.)\nFootnote AH:\nSuch hypocritical dreams are not unusual occurrences with me or with\nothers. While I am working up a certain scientific problem, I am\nvisited for many nights in rapid succession by a somewhat confusing\ndream which has as its content reconciliation with a friend long ago\ndropped. After three or four attempts, I finally succeeded in grasping\nthe meaning of this dream. It was in the nature of an encouragement to\ngive up the little consideration still left for the person in\nquestion, to drop him completely, but it disguised itself shamefacedly\nin the opposite feeling. I have reported a \u201chypocritical Oedipus\ndream\u201d of a person, in which the hostile feelings and the wishes of\ndeath of the dream thoughts were replaced by manifest tenderness.\n(\u201cTypisches Beispiel eines verkappten Oedipustraumes,\u201d _Zentralblatt\nf\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_, Bd. 1, Heft 1\u201311, 1910.) Another class of\nhypocritical dreams will be reported in another place.\nFootnote AI:\nTo sit for the painter. Goethe: \u201cAnd if he has no backside, how can\nthe nobleman sit?\u201d\nFootnote AJ:\nI myself regret the introduction of such passages from the\npsychopathology of hysteria, which, because of their fragmentary\nrepresentation and of being torn from all connection with the subject,\ncannot have a very enlightening influence. If these passages are\ncapable of throwing light upon the intimate relations between the\ndream and the psychoneuroses, they have served the purpose for which I\nhave taken them up.\nFootnote AK:\nSomething like the smoked salmon in the dream of the deferred supper.\nFootnote AL:\nIt often happens that a dream is told incompletely, and that a\nrecollection of the omitted portions appears only in the course of the\nanalysis. These portions subsequently fitted in, regularly furnish the\nkey to the interpretation. _Cf._ below, about forgetting in dreams.\nFootnote AM:\nSimilar \u201ccounter wish-dreams\u201d have been repeatedly reported to me\nwithin the last few years by my pupils who thus reacted to their first\nencounter with the \u201cwish theory of the dream.\u201d\nFootnote AN:\nWe may mention here the simplification and modification of this\nfundamental formula, propounded by Otto Rank: \u201cOn the basis and with\nthe help of repressed infantile sexual material, the dream regularly\nrepresents as fulfilled actual, and as a rule also erotic, wishes, in\na disguised and symbolic form.\u201d (\u201cEin Traum, der sich selbst deutet,\u201d\n_Jahrbuch_, v., Bleuler-Freud, II. B., p. 519, 1910.)\nFootnote AO:\nSee _Selected Papers on Hysteria and other Psychoneuroses_, p. 133,\ntranslated by A. A. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_,\nMonograph Series.\nFootnote AP:\nIt is clear that the conception of Robert, that the dream is intended\nto rid our memory of the useless impressions which it has received\nduring the day, is no longer tenable, if indifferent memories of\nchildhood appear in the dream with some degree of frequency. The\nconclusion would have to be drawn that the dream ordinarily performs\nvery inadequately the duty which is prescribed for it.\nFootnote AQ:\nAs mentioned in the first chapter, p. 67, H. Swoboda applies broadly\nto the psychic activity, the biological intervals of twenty-three and\ntwenty-eight days discovered by W. Fliess, and lays especial emphasis\nupon the fact that these periods are determinant for the appearance of\nthe dream elements in dreams. There would be no material change in\ndream interpretation if this could be proven, but it would result in a\nnew source for the origin of the dream material. I have recently\nundertaken some examination of my own dreams in order to test the\napplicability of the \u201cPeriod Theory\u201d to the dream material, and I have\nselected for this purpose especially striking elements of the dream\ncontent, whose origin could be definitely ascertained:\u2014\nI.\u2014_Dream from October 1\u20132, 1910_\n(Fragment).... Somewhere in Italy. Three daughters show me small\ncostly objects, as if in an antiquity shop. At the same time they sit\ndown on my lap. Of one of the pieces I remark: \u201cWhy, you got this from\nme.\u201d I also see distinctly a small profile mask with the angular\nfeatures of Savonarola.\nWhen have I last seen a picture of Savonarola? According to my\ntravelling diary, I was in Florence on the fourth and fifth of\nSeptember, and while there thought of showing my travelling companion\nthe plaster medallion of the features of the fanatical monk in the\nPiazza Signoria, the same place where he met his death by burning. I\nbelieve that I called his attention to it at 3 A.M. To be sure, from\nthis impression, until its return in the dream, there was an interval\nof twenty-seven and one days\u2014a \u201cfeminine period,\u201d according to Fliess.\nBut, unfortunately for the demonstrative force of this example, I must\nadd that on the very day of the dream I was visited (the first time\nafter my return) by the able but melancholy-looking colleague whom I\nhad already years before nicknamed \u201cRabbi Savonarola.\u201d He brought me a\npatient who had met with an accident on the Pottebba railroad, on\nwhich I had myself travelled eight days before, and my thoughts were\nthus turned to my last Italian journey. The appearance in the dream\ncontent of the striking element of Savonarola is explained by the\nvisit of my colleague on the day of the dream; the twenty-eight day\ninterval had no significance in its origin.\nII.\u2014_Dream from October 10\u201311_\nI am again studying chemistry in the University laboratory. Court\nCouncillor L. invites me to come to another place, and walks before me\nin the corridor carrying in front of him in his uplifted hand a lamp\nor some other instrument, and assuming a peculiar attitude, his head\nstretched forward. We then come to an open space ... (rest forgotten).\nIn this dream content, the most striking part is the manner in which\nCourt Councillor L. carries the lamp (or lupe) in front of him, his\ngaze directed into the distance. I have not seen L. for many years,\nbut I now know that he is only a substitute for another greater\nperson\u2014for Archimedes near the Arethusa fountain in Syracuse, who\nstands there exactly like L. in the dream, holding the burning mirror\nand gazing at the besieging army of the Romans. When had I first (and\nlast) seen this monument? According to my notes, it was on the\nseventeenth day of September, in the evening, and from this date to\nthe dream there really passed 13 and 10, equals 23, days-according to\nFliess, a \u201cmasculine period.\u201d\nBut I regret to say that here, too, this connection seems somewhat\nless inevitable when we enter into the interpretation of this dream.\nThe dream was occasioned by the information, received on the day of\nthe dream, that the lecture-room in the clinic in which I was invited\nto deliver my lectures had been changed to some other place. I took it\nfor granted that the new room was very inconveniently situated, and\nsaid to myself, it is as bad as not having any lecture-room at my\ndisposal. My thoughts must have then taken me back to the time when I\nfirst became a docent, when I really had no lecture-room, and when, in\nmy efforts to get one, I met with little encouragement from the very\ninfluential gentlemen councillors and professors. In my distress at\nthat time, I appealed to L., who then had the title of dean, and whom\nI considered kindly disposed. He promised to help me, but that was all\nI ever heard from him. In the dream he is the Archimedes, who gives me\nthe \u03c0\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9 and leads me into the other room. That neither the desire\nfor revenge nor the consciousness of one\u2019s own importance is absent in\nthis dream will be readily divined by those familiar with dream\ninterpretation. I must conclude, however, that without this motive for\nthe dream, Archimedes would hardly have got into the dream that night.\nI am not certain whether the strong and still recent impression of the\nstatue in Syracuse did not also come to the surface at a different\ninterval of time.\nIII.\u2014_Dream from October 2\u20133, 1910._\n(Fragment) ... Something about Professor Oser, who himself prepared\nthe menu for me, which served to restore me to great peace of mind\n(rest forgotten).\nThe dream was a reaction to the digestive disturbances of this day,\nwhich made me consider asking one of my colleagues to arrange a diet\nfor me. That in the dream I selected for this purpose Professor Oser,\nwho had died in the summer, is based on the recent death (October 1)\nof another university teacher, whom I highly revered. But when did\nOser die, and when did I hear of his death? According to the newspaper\nnotice, he died on the 22nd of August, but as I was at the time in\nHolland, whither my Vienna newspapers were regularly sent me, I must\nhave read the obituary notice on the 24th or 25th of August. This\ninterval no longer corresponds to any period. It takes in 7 and 30 and\n2, equals 39, days, or perhaps 38 days. I cannot recall having spoken\nor thought of Oser during this interval.\nSuch intervals as were not available for the \u201cperiod theory\u201d without\nfurther elaboration, were shown from my dreams to be far more frequent\nthan the regular ones. As maintained in the text, the only thing\nconstantly found is the relation to an impression of the day of the\ndream itself.\nFootnote AR:\n_Cf._ my essay, \u201cUeber Deckerinnerungen,\u201d in the _Monatsschrift f\u00fcr\nPsychiatrie und Neurologie_, 1899.\nFootnote AS:\nGer., _bl\u00fchend_.\nFootnote AT:\nThe tendency of the dream function to fuse everything of interest\nwhich is present into simultaneous treatment has already been noticed\nby several authors, for instance, by Delage,[15] p. 41, Delb\u0153uf,[16]\n_Rapprochement Forc\u00e9_, p. 236.\nFootnote AU:\nThe dream of Irma\u2019s injection; the dream of the friend who is my\nuncle.\nFootnote AV:\nThe dream of the funeral oration of the young physician.\nFootnote AW:\nThe dream of the botanical monograph.\nFootnote AX:\nThe dreams of my patients during analysis are mostly of this kind.\nFootnote AY:\n_Cf._ Chap.

(Translator.)\nFootnote BF:\nBoth the emotions which belong to these childish scenes\u2014astonishment\nand resignation to the inevitable\u2014had appeared in a dream shortly\nbefore, which was the first thing that brought back the memory of this\nchildhood experience.\nFootnote BG:\nI do not elaborate plagiostomi purposely; they recall an occasion of\nangry disgrace before the same teacher.\nFootnote BH:\n_Cf._ Maury\u2019s dream about kilo-lotto, p. 50.\nFootnote BI:\nPopo = backside in German nursery language.\nFootnote BJ:\nThis repetition has insinuated itself into the text of the dream\napparently through my absent-mindedness, and I allow it to remain\nbecause the analysis shows that it has its significance.\nFootnote BK:\nNot in _Germinal_, but in _La Terre_\u2014a mistake of which I became aware\nonly in the analysis. I may call attention also to the identity of the\nletters in _Huflattich_ and _Flatus_.\nFootnote BL:\nTranslator\u2019s note.\nFootnote BM:\nIn his significant work (\u201cPhantasie und Mythos,\u201d _Jahrbuch f\u00fcr\nPsychoanalyse_, Bd. ii., 1910), H. Silberer has endeavoured to show\nfrom this part of the dream that the dream-work is able to reproduce\nnot only the latent dream thoughts, but also the psychic processes in\nthe dream formation (\u201cDas functionale Ph\u00e4nomen\u201d).\nFootnote BN:\nAnother interpretation: He is one-eyed like Odin, the father of the\ngods ... Odin\u2019s consolation. The consolation in the childish scene,\nthat I will buy him a new bed.\nFootnote BO:\nI here add some material for interpretation. Holding the urinal\nrecalls the story of a peasant who tries one glass after another at\nthe opticians, but still cannot read (peasant-catcher, like\ngirl-catcher in a portion of the dream). The treatment among the\npeasants of the father who has become weak-minded in Zola\u2019s _La\nTerre_. The pathetic atonement that in his last days the father soils\nhis bed like a child; hence, also, I am his sick-attendant in the\ndream. Thinking and experiencing are here, as it were; the same thing\nrecalls a highly revolutionary closet drama by Oscar Panizza, in which\nthe Godhead is treated quite contemptuously, as though he were a\nparalytic old man. There occurs a passage: \u201cWill and deed are the same\nthing with him, and he must be prevented by his archangel, a kind of\nGanymede, from scolding and swearing, because these curses would\nimmediately be fulfilled.\u201d Making plans is a reproach against my\nfather, dating from a later period in the development of my critical\nfaculty; just as the whole rebellious, sovereign-offending dream, with\nits scoff at high authority, originates in a revolt against my father.\nThe sovereign is called father of the land (_Landesvater_), and the\nfather is the oldest, first and only authority for the child, from the\nabsolutism of which the other social authorities have developed in the\ncourse of the history of human civilisation (in so far as the\n\u201cmother\u2019s right\u201d does not force a qualification of this thesis). The\nidea in the dream, \u201cthinking and experiencing are the same thing,\u201d\nrefers to the explanation of hysterical symptoms, to which the male\nurinal (glass) also has a relation. I need not explain the principle\nof the \u201cGschnas\u201d to a Viennese; it consists in constructing objects of\nrare and costly appearance out of trifles, and preferably out of\ncomical and worthless material\u2014for example, making suits of armour out\nof cooking utensils, sticks and \u201csalzstangeln\u201d (elongated rolls), as\nour artists like to do at their jolly parties. I had now learned that\nhysterical subjects do the same thing; besides what has actually\noccurred to them, they unconsciously conceive horrible or extravagant\nfantastic images, which they construct from the most harmless and\ncommonplace things they have experienced. The symptoms depend solely\nupon these phantasies, not upon the memory of their real experiences,\nbe they serious or harmless. This explanation helped me to overcome\nmany difficulties and gave me much pleasure. I was able to allude to\nit in the dream element \u201cmale urinal\u201d (glass) because I had been told\nthat at the last \u201cGschnas\u201d evening a poison chalice of Lucretia Borgia\nhad been exhibited, the chief constituent of which had consisted of a\nglass urinal for men, such as is used in hospitals.\nFootnote BP:\n_Cf._ the passage in Griesinger[31] and the remarks in my second essay\non the \u201cdefence-neuropsychoses\u201d\u2014_Selected Papers on Hysteria_,\ntranslated by A.

With all this, Hans is a\ngood-natured, affectionate child, who soon becomes fond of his sister,\nand likes especially to take her under his protection.\nFootnote BZ:\nThe three-and-a-half-year old Hans embodies his crushing criticism of\nhis little sister in the identical word (see previous notes).

Seelenkunde_, 1909.\nFootnote CC:\nAct. i. sc. 2. Translated by George Somers Clark.\nFootnote CD:\nAnother of the great creations of tragic poetry, Shakespeare\u2019s\n_Hamlet_, is founded on the same basis as the _Oedipus_. But the whole\ndifference in the psychic life of the two widely separated periods of\ncivilisation\u2014the age-long progress of repression in the emotional life\nof humanity\u2014is made manifest in the changed treatment of the identical\nmaterial. In _Oedipus_ the basic wish-phantasy of the child is brought\nto light and realised as it is in the dream; in _Hamlet_ it remains\nrepressed, and we learn of its existence\u2014somewhat as in the case of a\nneurosis\u2014only by the inhibition which results from it. The fact that\nit is possible to remain in complete darkness concerning the character\nof the hero, has curiously shown itself to be consistent with the\noverpowering effect of the modern drama. The play is based upon\nHamlet\u2019s hesitation to accomplish the avenging task which has been\nassigned to him; the text does not avow the reasons or motives of this\nhesitation, nor have the numerous attempts at interpretation succeeded\nin giving them. According to the conception which is still current\nto-day, and which goes back to Goethe, Hamlet represents the type of\nman whose prime energy is paralysed by over-development of thought\nactivity. (\u201cSicklied o\u2019er with the pale cast of thought.\u201d) According\nto others the poet has attempted to portray a morbid, vacillating\ncharacter who is subject to neurasthenia. The plot of the story,\nhowever, teaches us that Hamlet is by no means intended to appear as a\nperson altogether incapable of action. Twice we see him asserting\nhimself actively, once in headlong passion, where he stabs the\neavesdropper behind the arras, and on another occasion where he sends\nthe two courtiers to the death which has been intended for\nhimself\u2014doing this deliberately, even craftily, and with all the lack\nof compunction of a prince of the Renaissance. What is it, then, that\nrestrains him in the accomplishment of the task which his father\u2019s\nghost has set before him? Here the explanation offers itself that it\nis the peculiar nature of this task. Hamlet can do everything but take\nvengeance upon the man who has put his father out of the way, and has\ntaken his father\u2019s place with his mother\u2014upon the man who shows him\nthe realisation of his repressed childhood wishes. The loathing which\nought to drive him to revenge is thus replaced in him by\nself-reproaches, by conscientious scruples, which represent to him\nthat he himself is no better than the murderer whom he is to punish. I\nhave thus translated into consciousness what had to remain unconscious\nin the mind of the hero; if some one wishes to call Hamlet a hysteric\nsubject I cannot but recognise it as an inference from my\ninterpretation. The sexual disinclination which Hamlet expresses in\nconversation with Ophelia, coincides very well with this view\u2014it is\nthe same sexual disinclination which was to take possession of the\npoet more and more during the next few years of his life, until the\nclimax of it is expressed in _Timon of Athens_. Of course it can only\nbe the poet\u2019s own psychology with which we are confronted in _Hamlet_;\nfrom a work on Shakespeare by George Brandes (1896), I take the fact\nthat the drama was composed immediately after the death of\nShakespeare\u2019s father\u2014that is to say, in the midst of recent mourning\nfor him\u2014during the revival, we may assume, of his childhood emotion\ntowards his father. It is also known that a son of Shakespeare\u2019s, who\ndied early, bore the name of Hamnet (identical with Hamlet). Just as\n_Hamlet_ treats of the relation of the son to his parents, _Macbeth_,\nwhich appears subsequently, is based upon the theme of childlessness.\nJust as every neurotic symptom, just as the dream itself, is capable\nof re-interpretation, and even requires it in order to be perfectly\nintelligible, so every genuine poetical creation must have proceeded\nfrom more than one motive, more than one impulse in the mind of the\npoet, and must admit of more than one interpretation. I have here\nattempted to interpret only the most profound group of impulses in the\nmind of the creative poet. The conception of the _Hamlet_ problem\ncontained in these remarks has been later confirmed in a detailed work\nbased on many new arguments by Dr. Ernest Jones, of Toronto (Canada).\nThe connection of the _Hamlet_ material with the \u201cMythus von der\nGeburt des Helden\u201d has also been demonstrated by O. Rank.\u2014\u201cThe\n_Oedipus_ Complex as an Explanation of _Hamlet\u2019s_ Mystery: a Study in\nMotive\u201d (_American Journal of Psychology_, January 1910, vol. xxi.).\nFootnote CE:\nLikewise, anything large, over-abundant, enormous, and exaggerated,\nmay be a childish characteristic. The child knows no more intense wish\nthan to become big, and to receive as much of everything as grown-ups;\nthe child is hard to satisfy; it knows no _enough_, and insatiably\ndemands the repetition of whatever has pleased it or tasted good to\nit. It learns to practise moderation, to be modest and resigned, only\nthrough culture and education. As is well known, the neurotic is also\ninclined toward immoderation and excess.\nFootnote CF:\nWhile Dr. Jones was delivering a lecture before an American scientific\nsociety, and speaking of egotism in dreams, a learned lady took\nexception to this unscientific generalisation. She thought that the\nlecturer could only pronounce such judgment on the dreams of\nAustrians, and had no right to include the dreams of Americans. As for\nherself she was sure that all her dreams were strictly altruistic.\nFootnote CG:\nAccording to C. G. Jung, dreams of dental irritation in the case of\nwomen have the significance of parturition dreams.\nFootnote CH:\n_Cf._ the \u201cbiographic\u201d dream on p. 235.\nFootnote CI:\nAs the dreams of pulling teeth, and teeth falling out, are interpreted\nin popular belief to mean the death of a close friend, and as\npsychoanalysis can at most only admit of such a meaning in the above\nindicated parodical sense, I insert here a dream of dental irritation\nplaced at my disposal by Otto Rank[109].\nUpon the subject of dreams of dental irritation I have received the\nfollowing report from a colleague who has for some time taken a lively\ninterest in the problems of dream interpretation:\n_I recently dreamed that I went to the dentist who drilled out one of\nmy back teeth in the lower jaw. He worked so long at it that the tooth\nbecame useless. He then grasped it with the forceps, and pulled it out\nwith such perfect ease that it astonished me. He said that I should\nnot care about it, as this was not really the tooth that had been\ntreated; and he put it on the table where the tooth (as it seems to me\nnow an upper incisor) fell apart into many strata. I arose from the\noperating chair, stepped inquisitively nearer, and, full of interest,\nput a medical question. While the doctor separated the individual\npieces of the strikingly white tooth and ground them up (pulverised\nthem) with an instrument, he explained to me that this had some\nconnection with puberty, and that the teeth come out so easily only\nbefore puberty; the decisive moment for this in women is the birth of\na child. I then noticed (as I believe half awake) that this dream was\naccompanied by a pollution which I cannot however definitely place at\na particular point in the dream; I am inclined to think that it began\nwith the pulling out of the tooth._\n_I then continued to dream something which I can no longer remember,\nwhich ended with the fact that I had left my hat and coat somewhere\n(perhaps at the dentist\u2019s), hoping that they would be brought after\nme, and dressed only in my overcoat I hastened to catch a departing\ntrain. I succeeded at the last moment in jumping upon the last car,\nwhere someone was already standing. I could not, however, get inside\nthe car, but was compelled to make the journey in an uncomfortable\nposition, from which I attempted to escape with final success. We\njourneyed through a long tunnel, in which two trains from the opposite\ndirection passed through our own train as if it were a tunnel. I\nlooked in as from the outside through a car window._\nAs material for the interpretation of this dream, we obtained the\nfollowing experiences and thoughts of the dreamer:\u2014\nI. For a short time I had actually been under dental treatment, and at\nthe time of the dream I was suffering from continual pains in the\ntooth of my lower jaw, which was drilled out in the dream, and on\nwhich the dentist had in fact worked longer than I liked. On the\nforenoon of the day of the dream I had again gone to the doctor\u2019s on\naccount of the pain, and he had suggested that I should allow him to\npull out another tooth than the one treated in the same jaw, from\nwhich the pain probably came. It was a \u2018wisdom tooth\u2019 which was just\nbreaking through. On this occasion, and in this connection, I had put\na question to his conscience as a physician.\nII. On the afternoon of the same day I was obliged to excuse myself to\na lady for my irritable disposition on account of the toothache, upon\nwhich she told me that she was afraid to have one of her roots pulled,\nthough the crown was almost completely gone. She thought that the\npulling out of eye teeth was especially painful and dangerous,\nalthough some acquaintance had told her that this was much easier when\nit was a tooth of the lower jaw. It was such a tooth in her case. The\nsame acquaintance also told her that while under an an\u00e6sthetic one of\nher false teeth had been pulled\u2014a statement which increased her fear\nof the necessary operation. She then asked me whether by eye teeth one\nwas to understand molars or canines, and what was known about them. I\nthen called her attention to the vein of superstitions in all these\nmeanings, without however, emphasising the real significance of some\nof the popular views. She knew from her own experience, a very old and\ngeneral popular belief, according to which _if a pregnant woman has\ntoothache she will give birth to a boy_.\nIII. This saying interested me in its relation to the typical\nsignificance of dreams of dental irritation as a substitute for\nonanism as maintained by Freud in his _Traumdeutung_ (2nd edition, p.\n193), for the teeth and the male genital (Bub-boy) are brought in\ncertain relations even in the popular saying. On the evening of the\nsame day I therefore read the passage in question in the\n_Traumdeutung_, and found there among other things the statements\nwhich will be quoted in a moment, the influence of which on my dream\nis as plainly recognisable as the influence of the two above-mentioned\nexperiences. Freud writes concerning dreams of dental irritation that\n\u2018in the case of men nothing else than cravings for masturbation from\nthe time of puberty furnishes the motive power for these dreams,\u2019 p.\n193. Further, \u2018I am of the opinion that the frequent modifications of\nthe typical dream of dental irritation\u2014that _e.g._ of another person\ndrawing the tooth from the dreamer\u2019s mouth\u2014are made intelligible by\nmeans of the same explanation. It may seem problematic, however, how\n\u201cdental irritation\u201d can arrive at this significance. I here call\nattention to the transference from below to above (in the dream in\nquestion from the lower to the upper jaw), which occurs so frequently,\nwhich is at the service of sexual repression, and by means of which\nall kinds of sensations and intentions occurring in hysteria which\nought to be enacted in the genitals can be realised upon less\nobjectionable parts of the body,\u2019 p. 194. \u2018But I must also refer to\nanother connection contained in an idiomatic expression. In our\ncountry there is in use an indelicate designation for the act of\nmasturbation, namely: To pull one out, or to pull one down,\u2019 p. 195,\n2nd edition. This expression had been familiar to me in early youth as\na designation for onanism, and from here on it will not be difficult\nfor the experienced dream interpreter to get access to the infantile\nmaterial which may lie at the basis of this dream. I only wish to add\nthat the facility with which the tooth in the dream came out, and the\nfact that it became transformed after coming out into an upper\nincisor, recalls to me an experience of childhood when I myself easily\nand painlessly pulled out one of my wobbling front teeth. This\nepisode, which I can still to this day distinctly remember with all\nits details, happened at the same early period in which my first\nconscious attempts at onanism began\u2014(Concealing Memory). The reference\nof Freud to an assertion of C. G. Jung that dreams of dental\nirritation in women signify parturition (footnote p. 194), together\nwith the popular belief in the significance of toothache in pregnant\nwomen, has established an opposition between the feminine significance\nand the masculine (puberty). In this connection I recall an earlier\ndream which I dreamed soon after I was discharged by the dentist after\nthe treatment, that the gold crowns which had just been put in fell\nout, whereupon I was greatly chagrined in the dream on account of the\nconsiderable expense, concerning which I had not yet stopped worrying.\nIn view of a certain experience this dream now becomes comprehensible\nas a commendation of the material advantages of masturbation when\ncontrasted with every form of the economically less advantageous\nobject-love (gold crowns are also Austrian gold coins).\nTheoretically this case seems to show a double interest. First it\nverifies the connection revealed by Freud, inasmuch as the ejaculation\nin the dream takes place during the act of tooth-pulling. For no\nmatter in what form a pollution may appear, we are obliged to look\nupon it as a masturbatic gratification which takes place without the\nhelp of mechanical excitation. Moreover the gratification by pollution\nin this case does not take place, as is usually the case, through an\nimaginary object, but it is without an object; and, if one may be\nallowed to say so, it is purely autoerotic, or at most it perhaps\nshows a slight homosexual thread (the dentist).\nThe second point which seems to be worth mentioning is the following:\nThe objection is quite obvious that we are seeking here to validate\nthe Freudian conception in a quite superfluous manner, for the\nexperiences of the reading itself are perfectly sufficient to explain\nto us the content of the dream. The visit to the dentist, the\nconversation with the lady, and the reading of the _Traumdeutung_ are\nsufficient to explain why the sleeper, who was also disturbed during\nthe night by toothache, should dream this dream, it may even explain\nthe removal of the sleep-disturbing pain (by means of the presentation\nof the removal of the painful tooth and simultaneous over-accentuation\nof the dreaded painful sensation through libido). But no matter how\nmuch of this assumption we may admit, we cannot earnestly maintain\nthat the readings of Freud\u2019s explanations have produced in the dreamer\nthe connection of the tooth-pulling with the act of masturbation; it\ncould not even have been made effective had it not been for the fact,\nas the dreamer himself admitted (\u2018to pull one off\u2019) that this\nassociation had already been formed long ago. What may have still more\nstimulated this association in connection with the conversation with\nthe lady is shown by a later assertion of the dreamer that while\nreading the _Traumdeutung_ he could not, for obvious reasons, believe\nin this typical meaning of dreams of dental irritation, and\nentertained the wish to know whether it held true for all dreams of\nthis nature. The dream now confirms this at least for his own person,\nand shows him why he had to doubt it. The dream is therefore also in\nthis respect the fulfilment of a wish; namely, to be convinced of the\nimportance and stability of this conception of Freud.\nFootnote CJ:\nA young colleague, who is entirely free from nervousness, tells me in\nthis connection: \u201cI know from my own experience that while swinging,\nand at the moment at which the downward movement had the greatest\nimpetus, I used to get a curious feeling in my genitals, which I must\ndesignate, although it was not really pleasant to me, as a voluptuous\nfeeling.\u201d I have often heard from patients that their first erections\naccompanied by voluptuous sensations had occurred in boyhood while\nthey were climbing. It is established with complete certainty by\npsychoanalyses that the first sexual impulses have often originated in\nthe scufflings and wrestlings of childhood.\nFootnote CK:\nThis naturally holds true only for German-speaking dreamers who are\nacquainted with the vulgarism \u201c_v\u00f6geln_.\u201d\nFootnote CL:\n_Sammlung kl.

Rank,[108] p. 534);\nthus a dream of sexual relations with the mother has been transmitted\nto us by Julius C\u00e6sar which the oneiroscopists interpreted as a\nfavourable omen for taking possession of the earth (Mother-earth). It\nis also known that the oracle declared to the Tarquinii that that one\nof them would become ruler of Rome who should first kiss the mother\n(_osculum, matri tulerit_), which Brutus conceived as referring to the\nmother-earth (_terram osculo contigit, scilicet quod ea communia mater\nomnium mortalium esset_, Livius, I., lxi.). These myths and\ninterpretations point to a correct psychological knowledge. I have\nfound that persons who consider themselves preferred or favoured by\ntheir mothers manifest in life that confidence in themselves and that\nfirm optimism which often seems heroic and brings about real success\nby force.\nFootnote CQ:\nIt is only of late that I have learned to value the significance of\nfancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb. They contain\nthe explanation of the curious fear felt by so many people of being\nburied alive, as well as the profoundest unconscious reason for the\nbelief in a life after death which represents nothing but a projection\ninto the future of this mysterious life before birth. _The act of\nbirth, moreover, is the first experience with fear, and is thus the\nsource and model of the emotion of fear._\nFootnote CR:\nFor such a dream see Pfister: \u201cEin Fall von Psychoanalytischer\nSeelensorge und Seelenheilung,\u201d _Evangelische Freiheit_, 1909.\nConcerning the symbol of \u201csaving\u201d see my lecture, \u201cDie Zuk\u00fcnftigen\nChancen der psychoanalytischen Therapie,\u201d _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr\nPsychoanalyse_, No. I., 1910.

He stated that his most frequent dream was of\nclimbing a stairway, and that there was surely nothing sexual behind\nthis. Our attention having been called to this objection, we directed\nour investigations to the occurrence of stairways, stairs, and ladders\nin the dream, and we soon ascertained that stairs (or anything\nanalogous to them) represent a definite symbol of coitus. The basis\nfor this comparison is not difficult to find; under rhythmic intervals\nand with increasing difficulty in breathing one reaches to a height,\nand may come down again in a few rapid jumps. Thus the rhythm of\ncoitus is recognisable in climbing stairs. Let us not forget to\nconsider the usage of language. It shows us that the \u201cclimbing\u201d or\n\u201cmounting\u201d is, without further addition, used as a substitutive\ndesignation of the sexual act. In French the step of the stairway is\ncalled \u201c_la marche_\u201d; \u201c_un vieux marcheur_\u201d corresponds exactly to our\n\u201can old climber.\u201d\u201d\nFootnote CV:\nIn this country where the word \u201cnecktie\u201d is almost exclusively used,\nthe translator has also found it to be a symbol of a burdensome woman\nfrom whom the dreamer longs to be freed\u2014\u201cnecktie\u2014something tied to my\nneck like a heavy weight\u2014my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d are the associations from the\ndream of a man who eventually broke his marriage engagement.\nFootnote CW:\nIn spite of all the differences between Scherner\u2019s conception of dream\nsymbolism and the one developed here, I must still assert that\nScherner[58] should be recognised as the true discoverer of symbolism\nin dreams, and that the experience of psychoanalysis has brought his\nbook into honourable repute after it had been considered fantastic for\nabout fifty years.\nFootnote CX:\nFrom \u201cNachtr\u00e4ge zur Traumdeutung,\u201d _Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_,\nI., No. 5 and 6, 1911.\nFootnote CY:\n\u201cBeitr\u00e4ge zur Traumdeutung,\u201d _Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Psychoanalyt. und psychop.\nForsch._, Bd.

You go to a field where\nsilver-berries are growing and pick them; then the berries are\neliminated and the silver remains in a free state.\u201d The first person\nwho read and criticised this book made the objection to me\u2014which other\nreaders will probably repeat\u2014\u201cthat the dreamer often appears too\nwitty.\u201d That is true, as long as it applies to the dreamer; it\ninvolves a condemnation only when its application is extended to the\ninterpreter of the dream. In waking reality I can make very little\nclaim to the predicate \u201cwitty\u201d; if my dreams appear witty, this is not\nthe fault of my individuality, but of the peculiar psychological\nconditions under which the dream is fabricated, and is intimately\nconnected with the theory of wit and the comical. The dream becomes\nwitty because the shortest and most direct way to the expression of\nits thoughts is barred for it: the dream is under constraint. My\nreaders may convince themselves that the dreams of my patients give\nthe impression of being witty (attempting to be witty), in the same\ndegree and in a greater than my own. Nevertheless this reproach\nimpelled me to compare the technique of wit with the dream activity,\nwhich I have done in a book published in 1905, on _Wit and its\nRelation to the Unconscious_. (Author.)\nFootnote DP:\nLasker died of progressive paralysis, that is of the consequences of\nan infection caught from a woman (lues); Lasalle, as is well known,\nwas killed in a duel on account of a lady.\nFootnote DQ:\nIn the case of a young man who was suffering from obsessions, but\nwhose intellectual functions were intact and highly developed, I\nrecently found the only exception to this rule. The speeches which\noccurred in his dreams did not originate in speeches which he had\nheard or had made himself, but corresponded to the undisfigured\nwording of his obsessive thoughts, which only came to his\nconsciousness in a changed state while he was awake.\nFootnote DR:\nPsychic intensity, value, and emphasis due to the interest of an idea\nare, of course, to be kept distinct from sensational intensity, and\nfrom intensity of that which is conceived.\nFootnote DS:\nSince I consider this reference of dream disfigurement to the censor\nas the essence of my dream theory, I here insert the latter portion of\na story \u201cTraumen wie Wachen\u201d from _Phantasien eines Realisten_, by\nLynkus, Vienna, (second edition, 1900), in which I find this chief\nfeature of my theory reproduced:\u2014\n\u201cConcerning a man who possesses the remarkable quality of never\ndreaming nonsense....\u201d\n\u201cYour marvellous characteristic of dreaming as you wake is based upon\nyour virtues, upon your goodness, your justice, and your love for\ntruth; it is the moral clearness of your nature which makes everything\nabout you intelligible.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you think the matter over carefully,\u201d replied the other, \u201cI\nalmost believe that all people are created as I am, and that no human\nbeing ever dreams nonsense! A dream which is so distinctly remembered\nthat it can be reproduced, which is therefore no dream of delirium,\n_always_ has a meaning; why, it cannot be otherwise! For that which is\nin contradiction with itself can never be grouped together as a whole.\nThe fact that time and space are often thoroughly shaken up detracts\nnothing from the real meaning of the dream, because neither of them\nhas had any significance whatever for its essential contents. We often\ndo the same thing in waking life; think of the fairy-tale, of many\ndaring and profound phantastic creations, about which only an ignorant\nperson would say: \u2018That is nonsense! For it is impossible.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIf it were only always possible to interpret dreams correctly, as you\nhave just done with mine!\u201d said the friend.\n\u201cThat is certainly not an easy task, but the dreamer himself ought\nalways to succeed in doing it with a little concentration of\nattention.... You ask why it is generally impossible? Your dreams seem\nto conceal something secret, something unchaste of a peculiar and\nhigher nature, a certain mystery in your nature which cannot easily be\nrevealed by thought; and it is for that reason that your dreaming\nseems so often to be without meaning, or even to be a contradiction.\nBut in the profoundest sense this is by no means the case; indeed it\ncannot be true at all, for it is always the same person, whether he is\nasleep or awake.\u201d\nFootnote DT:\nI have since given the complete analysis and synthesis of two dreams\nin the _Bruchstueck einer Hysterieanalyse_, 1905.\nFootnote DU:\nFrom a work of K. Abel, _Der Gegensinn der Urworte_, 1884 (see my\nreview of it in the Bleuler-Freud _Jahrbuch_, II., 1910), I learned\nwith surprise a fact which is confirmed by other philologists, that\nthe oldest languages behaved in this regard quite like the dream. They\noriginally had only one word for both extremes in a series of\nqualities or activities (strong\u2014weak, old\u2014young, far\u2014near, to tie\u2014to\nseparate), and formed separate designations for the two extremes only\nsecondarily through slight modifications of the common primitive word.\nAbel demonstrated these relationships with rare exceptions in the old\nEgyptian, and he was able to show distinct remnants of the same\ndevelopment in the Semitic and Indo-Germanic languages.\nFootnote DV:\nIf I do not know behind which of the persons which occur in the dream\nI am to look for my ego, I observe the following rule: That person in\nthe dream who is subject to an emotion which I experience while\nasleep, is the one that conceals my ego.\nFootnote DW:\nThe hysterical attack sometimes uses the same device\u2014the inversion of\ntime-relations\u2014for the purpose of concealing its meaning from the\nspectator. The attack of a hysterical girl, for example, consists in\nenacting a little romance, which she has unconsciously fancied in\nconnection with an encounter in the street car. A man, attracted by\nthe beauty of her foot, addresses her while she is reading, whereupon\nshe goes with him and experiences a stormy love scene. Her attack\nbegins with the representation of this scene in writhing movements of\nthe body (accompanied by motions of the lips to signify kissing,\nentwining of the arms for embraces), whereupon she hurries into\nanother room, sits down in a chair, lifts her skirt in order to show\nher foot, acts as though she were about to read a book, and speaks to\nme (answers me).\nFootnote DX:\nAccompanying hysterical symptoms: Failure to menstruate and profound\ndepression, which was the chief ailment of the patient.\nFootnote DY:\nA reference to a childhood experience is after complete analysis shown\nto exist by the following intermediaries: \u201cThe Moor has done his duty,\nthe Moor _may go_.\u201d And then follows the waggish question: \u201cHow old is\nthe Moor when he has done his duty? One year. Then he may go.\u201d (It is\nsaid that I came into the world with so much black curly hair that my\nyoung mother declared me to be a Moor.) The circumstance that I do not\nfind my hat is an experience of the day which has been turned to\naccount with various significations. Our servant, who is a genius at\nstowing away things, had hidden the hat. A suppression of sad thoughts\nabout death is also concealed behind the conclusion of the dream: \u201cI\nhave not nearly done my duty yet; I may not go yet.\u201d Birth and death,\nas in the dream that occurred shortly before about Goethe and the\nparalytic (p. 345).\nFootnote DZ:\nCf. _Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewussten_, 2nd edit. 1912,\nand \u201cword-bridges,\u201d in the solutions of neurotic symptoms.\nFootnote EA:\nIn general it is doubtful in the interpretation of every element of\nthe dream whether it\u2014\n(_a_) is to be regarded as having a negative or a positive sense\n(relation of opposition);\n(_b_) is to be interpreted historically (as a reminiscence);\n(_c_) is symbolic; or whether\n(_d_) its valuation is to be based upon the sound of its verbal\nexpression.\nIn spite of this manifold signification, it may be said that the\nrepresentation of the dream activity does not impose upon the\ntranslator any greater difficulties than the ancient writers of\nhieroglyphics imposed upon their readers.\nFootnote EB:\nFor the interpretation of this preliminary dream, which is to be\nregarded as \u201ccasual,\u201d see p. 292.\nFootnote EC:\nHer career.\nFootnote ED:\nHigh birth, the wish contrast to the preliminary dream.\nFootnote EE:\nA composite image, which unites two localities, the so-called garret\n(German _Boden_\u2014floor, garret) of her father\u2019s house, in which she\nplayed with her brother, the object of her later fancies, and the\ngarden of a malicious uncle, who used to tease her.\nFootnote EF:\nWish contrast to an actual memory of her uncle\u2019s garden, to the effect\nthat she used to expose herself while she was asleep.\nFootnote EG:\nJust as the angel bears a lily stem in the Annunciation.\nFootnote EH:\nFor the explanation of this composite image, see p. 296; innocence,\nmenstruation, Camille.\nFootnote EI:\nReferring to the plurality of the persons who serve the purpose of her\nfancy.\nFootnote EJ:\nWhether it is permitted to \u201cpull one off,\u201d _i.e._ to masturbate.\nFootnote EK:\nThe bough has long since been used to represent the male genital, and\nbesides that it contains a very distinct allusion to the family name\nof the dreamer.\nFootnote EL:\nRefers to matrimonial precautions, as does that which follows.\nFootnote EM:\nAn analogous \u201cbiographical\u201d dream was reported on p. 252, as the third\nof the examples of dream symbolism; a second example is the one fully\nreported by Rank[106] under the title \u201cTraum der sich selbst deutet\u201d;\nfor another one which must be read in the \u201copposite direction,\u201d see\nStekel[114], p. 486.\nFootnote EN:\nGiven by translator as author\u2019s example could not be translated.\nFootnote EO:\nThe neurosis also proceeds in the same manner. I know a patient who\ninvoluntarily\u2014contrary to her own wishes\u2014hears (hallucinatory) songs\nor fragments of songs without being able to understand their meaning\nto her psychic life. She is surely not a paranoiac. Analysis showed\nthat she wrongly utilised the text of these songs by means of a\ncertain license. \u201cOh thou blissful one, Oh thou happy one,\u201d is the\nbeginning of a Christmas song. By not continuing it to the word\n\u201cChristmas time\u201d she makes a bridal song out of it, &c. The same\nmechanism of disfigurement may take place also without hallucinations\nas a mere mental occurrence.\nFootnote EP:\nAs a contribution to the over-determination: My excuse for coming late\nwas that after working late at night I had in the morning to make the\nlong journey from Kaiser Josef Street to Waehringer Street.\nFootnote EQ:\nIn addition C\u00e6sar\u2014Kaiser.\nFootnote ER:\nI have forgotten in what author I found a dream mentioned that was\noverrun with unusually small figures, the source of which turned out\nto be one of the engravings of Jacques Callot, which the dreamer had\nlooked at during the day. These engravings contained an enormous\nnumber of very small figures; a series of them treats of the horrors\nof the Thirty Years\u2019 War.\nFootnote ES:\nThe frequency with which in the dream dead persons appear as living,\nact, and deal with us, has called forth undue astonishment and given\nrise to strange explanations, from which our ignorance of the dream\nbecomes strikingly evident. And yet the explanation for these dreams\nlies very close at hand. How often we have occasion to think: \u201c_If_\nfather were still alive, what would he say to it?\u201d The dream can\nexpress this _if_ in no other way than by present time in a definite\nsituation. Thus, for instance, a young man, whose grandfather has left\nhim a great inheritance, dreams that his grandfather is alive and\ndemands an accounting of him, upon an occasion when the young man had\nbeen reproached for making too great an expenditure of money. What we\nconsider a resistance to the dream\u2014the objection made by our better\nknowledge, that after all the man is already dead\u2014is in reality a\nconsolation, because the dead person did not have this or that\nexperience, or satisfaction at the knowledge that he has nothing more\nto say.\nAnother form of absurdity found in dreams of deceased relatives does\nnot express folly and absurdity, but serves to represent the most\nextreme rejection; as the representation of a repressed thought which\none would gladly have appear as something least thought of. Dreams of\nthis kind are only solvable if one recalls that the dream makes no\ndistinction between things desired and realities. Thus, for example, a\nman who nursed his father during his sickness, and who felt his death\nvery keenly, sometime afterward dreamed the following senseless dream:\n_The father was again living, and conversed with him as usual, but_\n(the remarkable thing about it) _he had nevertheless died, though he\ndid not know it_. This dream can be understood if after \u201che had\nnevertheless died,\u201d one inserts _in consequence of the dreamer\u2019s wish,\nand_ if after \u201cbut he did not know it\u201d one adds _that the dreamer has\nentertained this wish_. While nursing his father, the son often wishes\nhis father\u2019s death; _i.e._ he entertained the really compassionate\ndesire that death finally put an end to his suffering. While mourning\nafter his death, this very wish of compassion became an unconscious\nreproach, as if it had really contributed to shorten the life of the\nsick man. Through the awakening of early infantile feelings against\nthe father, it became possible to express this reproach as a dream;\nand it was just because of the world-wide contrast between the dream\ninciter and day thought that this dream had to come out so absurdly\n(_cf._ with this, \u201cFormulierungen \u00fcber die zwei Prinzipien des\nseelischen Geschehens,\u201d _Jahrbuch_, Bleuler-Freud, III, 1, 1911).\nFootnote ET:\nHere the dream activity parodies the thought which it designates as\nridiculous, in that it creates something ridiculous in relation to it.\nHeine does something similar when he tries to mock the bad rhymes of\nthe King of Bavaria. He does it in still worse rhymes:\n\u201cHerr Ludwig ist ein grosser Poet\nUnd singt er, so stuerzt Apollo\nVor ihm auf die Knie und bittet und fleht,\n\u2018Halt ein, ich werde sonst toll oh!\u2019\u201d\nFootnote EU:\nNote the resemblance of _Geseres_ and _Ungeseres_ to the German words\nfor salted and unsalted\u2014_gesalzen_ and _ungesalzen_; also to the\nGerman words for soured and unsoured\u2014_gesauert_ and _ungesauert_.\n(Translator.)\nFootnote EV:\nThis dream also furnishes a good example for the general thesis that\ndreams of the same night, even though they be separated in memory,\nspring from the same thought material. The dream situation in which I\nam rescuing my children from the city of Rome, moreover, is disfigured\nby a reference to an episode belonging to my childhood. The meaning is\nthat I envy certain relatives who years ago had occasion to transplant\ntheir children to another soil.\nFootnote EW:\nThis German expression is equivalent to our saying \u201cYou are not\nresponsible for that,\u201d or \u201cThat has not been acquired through your own\nefforts.\u201d (Translator.)\nFootnote EX:\nThe injunction or purpose contained in the dream, \u201cI must tell that to\nthe doctor,\u201d which occurs in dreams that are dreamed in the course of\npsychoanalytical treatment, regularly corresponds to a great\nresistance to the confession involved in the dream, and is not\ninfrequently followed by forgetting of the dream.\nFootnote EY:\nA subject about which an extensive discussion has taken place in the\nvolumes of the _Revue Philosophique_\u2014(Paramnesia in the Dream).\nFootnote EZ:\nThese results correct in several respects my earlier statements\nconcerning the representation of logical relations (p. 290). The\nlatter described the general conditions of dream activity, but they\ndid not take into consideration its finest and most careful\nperformances.\nFootnote FA:\nStanniol, allusion to _Stannius_, the nervous system of fishes; _cf._\np. 325.\nFootnote FB:\nThe place in the corridor of my apartment house where the baby\ncarriages of the other tenants stand; it is also otherwise several\ntimes over-determined.\nFootnote FC:\nThis description is not intelligible even to myself, but I follow the\nprinciple of reproducing the dream in those words which occur to me\nwhile I am writing it down. The wording itself is a part of the dream\nrepresentation.\nFootnote FD:\nSchiller was not born in one of the Marburgs, but in Marbach, as every\ngraduate of a Gymnasium knows, and as I also knew. This again is one\nof those errors (_cf._ p. 165) which are included as substitutes for\nan intended deception at another place\u2014an explanation of which I have\nattempted in the _Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens_.\nFootnote FE:\nAs analogy to this, I have since explained the extraordinary effect of\npleasure produced by \u201ctendency\u201d wit.\nFootnote FF:\nIt is this fancy from the unconscious dream thoughts which\nperemptorily demands _non vivit_ instead of _non vixit_. \u201cYou have\ncome too late, he is no longer alive.\u201d The fact that the manifest\nsituation also tends towards \u201cnon vivit\u201d has been mentioned on page\n334.\nFootnote FG:\nIt is striking that the name Joseph plays such a large part in my\ndreams (see the dream about my uncle). I can hide my ego in the dream\nbehind persons of this name with particular ease, for Joseph was the\nname of the _dream interpreter_ in the Bible.\nFootnote FH:\nR\u00eave, petit roman\u2014day-dream, story.\nFootnote FI:\nI have analysed a good example of a dream of this kind having its\norigin in the stratification of several phantasies, in the _Bruchst\u00fcck\neiner Hysterie Analyse_, 1905. Moreover I undervalued the significance\nof such phantasies for dream formation, as long as I was working\nchiefly with my own dreams, which were based rarely upon day dreams,\nmost frequently upon discussions and mental conflicts. With other\npersons it is often much easier to prove the _full analogy between the\nnocturnal dream and the day dream_. It is often possible in an\nhysterical patient to replace an attack by a dream; it is then obvious\nthat the phantasy of day dreams is the first step for both psychic\nformations.\nFootnote FJ:\nSee the _Psychopathology of Everyday Life_, 4th ed., 1912. (English\ntranslation in preparation.)\nFootnote FK:\nConcerning the object of forgetting in general, see the\n_Psychopathology of Everyday Life_.\nFootnote FL:\nTranslated by A. A. Brill, appearing under the title _Selected Papers\non Hysteria_.\nFootnote FM:\nJung has brilliantly corroborated this statement by analyses of\nDementia Praecox. (_The Psychology of Dementia Praecox_, translated by\nF. Peterson and A. A. Brill.)\nFootnote FN:\nThe same considerations naturally hold true also for the case where\nsuperficial associations are exposed in the dream, as, _e.g._, in both\ndreams reported by Maury (p. 50, _p\u00e9lerinage_\u2014_pelletier_\u2014_pelle_,\n_kilometer_\u2014_kilogram_\u2014_gilolo_, _Lobelia_\u2014_Lopez_\u2014_Lotto_). I know\nfrom my work with neurotics what kind of reminiscence preferentially\nrepresents itself in this manner. It is the consultation of\nencyclop\u00e6dias by which most people pacify their desire for explanation\nof the sexual riddle during the period of curiosity in puberty.\nFootnote FO:\nThe above sentences, which when written sounded very improbable, have\nsince been justified experimentally by Jung and his pupils in the\n_Diagnostische Assoziationsstudien_.\nFootnote FP:\n_Selected Papers on Hysteria and Other Psychoneuroses_, p. 165,\ntranslated by A. A. Brill (_Journal Mental and Nervous Disease_\nPublishing Co.).\nFootnote FQ:\nThe German word \u201cDutzendmensch\u201d (a man of dozens) which the young lady\nwished to use in order to express her real opinion of her friend\u2019s\nfianc\u00e9, denotes a person with whom figures are everything.\n(Translator.)\nFootnote FR:\nThey share this character of indestructibility with all psychic acts\nthat are really unconscious\u2014that is, with psychic acts belonging to\nthe system of the unconscious only. These paths are constantly open\nand never fall into disuse; they conduct the discharge of the exciting\nprocess as often as it becomes endowed with unconscious excitement. To\nspeak metaphorically they suffer the same form of annihilation as the\nshades of the lower region in the _Odyssey_, who awoke to new life the\nmoment they drank blood. The processes depending on the foreconscious\nsystem are destructible in a different way. The psychotherapy of the\nneuroses is based on this difference.\nFootnote FS:\nLe Lorrain justly extols the wish-fulfilment of the dream: \u201cSans\nfatigue s\u00e9rieuse, sans \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 cette lutte opini\u00e2tre\net longue qui use et corrode les jouissances poursuivies.\u201d\nFootnote FT:\nThis idea has been borrowed from _The Theory of Sleep_ by Li\u00e9bault,\nwho revived hypnotic investigation in our days. (_Du Sommeil\nprovoqu\u00e9_, etc.; Paris, 1889.)\nFootnote FU:\nThe German of the word _bird_ is \u201cVogel,\u201d which gives origin to the\nvulgar expression \u201cv\u00f6glen,\u201d denoting sexual intercourse. (Trans.\nnote.)\nFootnote FV:\nThe italics are my own, though the meaning is plain enough without\nthem.\nFootnote FW:\nThe italics are mine.\nFootnote FX:\n_Cf._ the significant observations by J. Breuer in our _Studies on\nHysteria_, 1895, and 2nd ed. 1909.\nFootnote FY:\nHere, as in other places, there are gaps in the treatment of the\nsubject, which I have left intentionally, because to fill them up\nwould require on the one hand too great effort, and on the other hand\nan extensive reference to material that is foreign to the dream. Thus\nI have avoided stating whether I connect with the word \u201csuppressed\u201d\nanother sense than with the word \u201crepressed.\u201d It has been made clear\nonly that the latter emphasizes more than the former the relation to\nthe unconscious. I have not entered into the cognate problem why the\ndream thoughts also experience distortion by the censor when they\nabandon the progressive continuation to consciousness and choose the\npath of regression. I have been above all anxious to awaken an\ninterest in the problems to which the further analysis of the\ndream-work leads and to indicate the other themes which meet these on\nthe way. It was not always easy to decide just where the pursuit\nshould be discontinued. That I have not treated exhaustively the part\nplayed in the dream by the psychosexual life and have avoided the\ninterpretation of dreams of an obvious sexual content is due to a\nspecial reason which may not come up to the reader\u2019s expectation. To\nbe sure, it is very far from my ideas and the principles expressed by\nme in neuropathology to regard the sexual life as a \u201cpudendum\u201d which\nshould be left unconsidered by the physician and the scientific\ninvestigator. I also consider ludicrous the moral indignation which\nprompted the translator of Artemidoros of Daldis to keep from the\nreader\u2019s knowledge the chapter on sexual dreams contained in the\n_Symbolism of the Dreams_. As for myself, I have been actuated solely\nby the conviction that in the explanation of sexual dreams I should be\nbound to entangle myself deeply in the still unexplained problems of\nperversion and bisexuality; and for that reason I have reserved this\nmaterial for another connection.\nFootnote FZ:\nThe dream is not the only phenomenon tending to base psychopathology\non psychology.

It is not claimed\nthat the facts here gathered are altogether new. The subject of the\nsexual instinct and its aberrations has long been before the scientific\nworld and the names of many effective toilers in this vast field are\nknown to every student. When one passes beyond the strict domains of\nscience and considers what is reported of the sexual life in folkways\nand art-lore and the history of primitive culture and in romance, the\nsources of information are immense. Freud has made considerable\nadditions to this stock of knowledge, but he has done also something of\nfar greater consequence than this. He has worked out, with incredible\npenetration, the part which this instinct plays in every phase of human\nlife and in the development of human character, and has been able to\nestablish on a firm footing the remarkable thesis that psychoneurotic\nillnesses never occur with a perfectly normal sexual life. Other sorts\nof emotions contribute to the result, but some aberration of the sexual\nlife is always present, as the cause of especially insistent emotions\nand repressions.\nThe instincts with which every child is born furnish desires or cravings\nwhich must be dealt with in some fashion. They may be refined\n(\"sublimated\"), so far as is necessary and desirable, into energies of\nother sorts--as happens readily with the play-instinct--or they may\nremain as the source of perversions and inversions, and of cravings of\nnew sorts substituted for those of the more primitive kinds under the\npressure of a conventional civilization. The symptoms of the functional\npsychoneuroses represent, after a fashion, some of these distorted\nattempts to find a substitute for the imperative cravings born of the\nsexual instincts, and their form often depends, in part at least, on the\npeculiarities of the sexual life in infancy and early childhood. It is\nFreud's service to have investigated this inadequately chronicled period\nof existence with extraordinary acumen. In so doing he made it plain\nthat the \"perversions\" and \"inversions,\" which reappear later under such\nstriking shapes, belong to the normal sexual life of the young child and\nare seen, in veiled forms, in almost every case of nervous illness.\nIt cannot too often be repeated that these discoveries represent no\nfanciful deductions, but are the outcome of rigidly careful observations\nwhich any one who will sufficiently prepare himself can verify. Critics\nfret over the amount of \"sexuality\" that Freud finds evidence of in the\nhistories of his patients, and assume that he puts it there. But such\ncriticisms are evidences of misunderstandings and proofs of ignorance.\nFreud had learned that the amnesias of hypnosis and of hysteria were not\nabsolute but relative and that in covering the lost memories, much more,\nof unexpected sort, was often found. Others, too, had gone as far as\nthis, and stopped. But this investigator determined that nothing but the\nabsolute impossibility of going further should make him cease from\nurging his patients into an inexorable scrutiny of the unconscious\nregions of their memories and thoughts, such as never had been made\nbefore. Every species of forgetfulness, even the forgetfulness of\nchildhood's years, was made to yield its hidden stores of knowledge;\ndreams, even though apparently absurd, were found to be interpreters of\na varied class of thoughts, active, although repressed as out of harmony\nwith the selected life of consciousness; layer after layer, new sets of\nmotives underlying motives were laid bare, and each patient's interest\nwas strongly enlisted in the task of learning to know himself in order\nmore truly and wisely to \"sublimate\" himself. Gradually other workers\njoined patiently in this laborious undertaking, which now stands, for\nthose who have taken pains to comprehend it, as by far the most\nimportant movement in psychopathology.\nIt must, however, be recognized that these essays, of which Dr. Brill\nhas given a translation that cannot but be timely, concern a subject\nwhich is not only important but unpopular. Few physicians read the works\nof v. Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Moll, and others of like sort.\nThe remarkable volumes of Havelock Ellis were refused publication in his\nnative England. The sentiments which inspired this hostile attitude\ntowards the study of the sexual life are still active, though growing\nsteadily less common. One may easily believe that if the facts which\nFreud's truth-seeking researches forced him to recognize and to publish\nhad not been of an unpopular sort, his rich and abundant contributions\nto observational psychology, to the significance of dreams, to the\netiology and therapeutics of the psychoneuroses, to the interpretation\nof mythology, would have won for him, by universal acclaim, the same\nrecognition among all physicians that he has received from a rapidly\nincreasing band of followers and colleagues.\nMay Dr. Brill's translation help toward this end.\nThere are two further points on which some comments should be made. The\nfirst is this, that those who conscientiously desire to learn all that\nthey can from Freud's remarkable contributions should not be content to\nread any one of them alone. His various publications, such as \"The\nSelected Papers on Hysteria and Other Psychoneuroses,\"[1] \"The\nInterpretation of Dreams,\"[2] \"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life,\"[3]\n\"Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious,\"[4] the analysis of the case\nof the little boy called Hans, the study of Leonardo da Vinci,[4a] and\nthe various short essays in the four Sammlungen kleiner Schriften, not\nonly all hang together, but supplement each other to a remarkable\nextent. Unless a course of study such as this is undertaken many critics\nmay think various statements and inferences in this volume to be far\nfetched or find them too obscure for comprehension.\nThe other point is the following: One frequently hears the\npsychoanalytic method referred to as if it was customary for those\npracticing it to exploit the sexual experiences of their patients and\nnothing more, and the insistence on the details of the sexual life,\npresented in this book, is likely to emphasize that notion. But the fact\nis, as every thoughtful inquirer is aware, that the whole progress of\ncivilization, whether in the individual or the race, consists largely in\na \"sublimation\" of infantile instincts, and especially certain portions\nof the sexual instinct, to other ends than those which they seemed\ndesigned to serve. Art and poetry are fed on this fuel and the evolution\nof character and mental force is largely of the same origin. All the\nforms which this sublimation, or the abortive attempts at sublimation,\nmay take in any given case, should come out in the course of a thorough\npsychoanalysis. It is not the sexual life alone, but every interest and\nevery motive, that must be inquired into by the physician who is seeking\nto obtain all the data about the patient, necessary for his reeducation\nand his cure. But all the thoughts and emotions and desires and motives\nwhich appear in the man or woman of adult years were once crudely\nrepresented in the obscure instincts of the infant, and among these\ninstincts those which were concerned directly or indirectly with the\nsexual emotions, in a wide sense, are certain to be found in every case\nto have been the most important for the end-result.\nJAMES J.

He accordingly reproduces the original text with but slight\nmodifications, contenting himself with the addition of a few footnotes.\nFor the rest, it is his ardent wish that this book may speedily become\nantiquated--to the end that the new material brought forward in it may\nbe universally accepted, while the shortcomings it displays may give\nplace to juster views.\nVIENNA, December, 1909.\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\nAfter watching for ten years the reception accorded to this book and the\neffect it has produced, I wish to provide the third edition of it with\nsome prefatory remarks dealing with the misunderstandings of the book\nand the demands, insusceptible of fulfillment, made against it. Let me\nemphasize in the first place that whatever is here presented is derived\nentirely from every-day medical experience which is to be made more\nprofound and scientifically important through the results of\npsychoanalytic investigation. The \"Three Contributions to the Theory of\nSex\" can contain nothing except what psychoanalysis obliges them to\naccept or what it succeeds in corroborating. It is therefore excluded\nthat they should ever be developed into a \"theory of sex,\" and it is\nalso quite intelligible that they will assume no attitude at all towards\nsome important problems of the sexual life. This should not however give\nthe impression that these omitted chapters of the great theme were\nunfamiliar to the author, or that they were neglected by him as\nsomething of secondary importance.\nThe dependence of this work on the psychoanalytic experiences which have\ndetermined the writing of it, shows itself not only in the selection but\nalso in the arrangement of the material. A certain succession of stages\nwas observed, the occasional factors are rendered prominent, the\nconstitutional ones are left in the background, and the ontogenetic\ndevelopment receives greater consideration than the phylogenetic. For\nthe occasional factors play the principal r\u00f4le in analysis, and are\nalmost completely worked up in it, while the constitutional factors only\nbecome evident from behind as elements which have been made functional\nthrough experience, and a discussion of these would lead far beyond the\nworking sphere of psychoanalysis.\nA similar connection determines the relation between ontogenesis and\nphylogenesis. Ontogenesis may be considered as a repetition of\nphylogenesis insofar as the latter has not been varied by a more recent\nexperience. The phylogenetic disposition makes itself visible behind the\nontogenetic process. But fundamentally the constitution is really the\nprecipitate of a former experience of the species to which the newer\nexperience of the individual being is added as the sum of the occasional\nfactors.\nBeside its thoroughgoing dependence on psychoanalytic investigation I\nmust emphasize as a character of this work of mine its intentional\nindependence of biological investigation. I have carefully avoided the\ninclusion of the results of scientific investigation in general sex\nbiology or of particular species of animals in this study of human\nsexual functions which is made possible by the technique of\npsychoanalysis. My aim was indeed to find out how much of the biology of\nthe sexual life of man can be discovered by means of psychological\ninvestigation; I was able to point to additions and agreements which\nresulted from this examination, but I did not have to become confused if\nthe psychoanalytic methods led in some points to views and results which\ndeviated considerably from those merely based on biology.\nI have added many passages in this edition, but I have abstained from\ncalling attention to them, as in former editions, by special marks. The\nscientific work in our sphere has at present been retarded in its\nprogress, nevertheless some supplements to this work were indispensable\nif it was to remain in touch with our newer psychoanalytic literature.\nVIENNA, October, 1914.\nI\nTHE SEXUAL ABERRATIONS[1]\nThe fact of sexual need in man and animal is expressed in biology by the\nassumption of a \"sexual impulse.\" This impulse is made analogous to the\nimpulse of taking nourishment, and to hunger. The sexual expression\ncorresponding to hunger not being found colloquilly, science uses the\nexpression \"libido.\"[2]\nPopular conception makes definite assumptions concerning the nature and\nqualities of this sexual impulse. It is supposed to be absent during\nchildhood and to commence about the time of and in connection with the\nmaturing process of puberty; it is supposed that it manifests itself in\nirresistible attractions exerted by one sex upon the other, and that its\naim is sexual union or at least such actions as would lead to union.\nBut we have every reason to see in these assumptions a very\nuntrustworthy picture of reality. On closer examination they are found\nto abound in errors, inaccuracies and hasty conclusions.\nIf we introduce two terms and call the person from whom the sexual\nattraction emanates the _sexual object_, and the action towards which\nthe impulse strives the _sexual aim_, then the scientifically examined\nexperience shows us many deviations in reference to both sexual object\nand sexual aim, the relations of which to the accepted standard require\nthorough investigation.\n1. DEVIATION IN REFERENCE TO THE SEXUAL OBJECT\nThe popular theory of the sexual impulse corresponds closely to the\npoetic fable of dividing the person into two halves--man and woman--who\nstrive to become reunited through love. It is therefore very surprising\nto hear that there are men for whom the sexual object is not woman but\nman, and that there are women for whom it is not man but woman. Such\n_persons_ are called contrary sexuals, or better, inverts; the\n_condition_, that of inversion. The number of such individuals is\nconsiderable though difficult of accurate determination.[3]\nA. _Inversion_\n*The Behavior of Inverts.*--The above-mentioned persons behave in many\nways quite differently.\n(_a_) They are absolutely inverted; _i.e._, their sexual object must be\nalways of the same sex, while the opposite sex can never be to them an\nobject of sexual longing, but leaves them indifferent or may even evoke\nsexual repugnance. As men they are unable, on account of this\nrepugnance, to perform the normal sexual act or miss all pleasure in its\nperformance.\n(_b_) They are amphigenously inverted (psychosexually hermaphroditic);\n_i.e._, their sexual object may belong indifferently to either the same\nor to the other sex. The inversion lacks the character of exclusiveness.\n(_c_) They are occasionally inverted; _i.e._, under certain external\nconditions, chief among which are the inaccessibility of the normal\nsexual object and initiation, they are able to take as the sexual\nobject a person of the same sex and thus find sexual gratification.\nThe inverted also manifest a manifold behavior in their judgment about\nthe peculiarities of their sexual impulse. Some take the inversion as a\nmatter of course, just as the normal person does regarding his libido,\nfirmly demanding the same rights as the normal. Others, however, strive\nagainst the fact of their inversion and perceive in it a morbid\ncompulsion.[4]\nOther variations concern the relations of time. The characteristics of\nthe inversion in any individual may date back as far as his memory goes,\nor they may become manifest to him at a definite period before or after\npuberty.[5] The character is either retained throughout life, or it\noccasionally recedes or represents an episode on the road to normal\ndevelopment. A periodical fluctuation between the normal and the\ninverted sexual object has also been observed. Of special interest are\nthose cases in which the libido changes, taking on the character of\ninversion after a painful experience with the normal sexual object.\nThese different categories of variation generally exist independently of\none another. In the most extreme cases it can regularly be assumed that\nthe inversion has existed at all times and that the person feels\ncontented with his peculiar state.\nMany authors will hesitate to gather into a unit all the cases\nenumerated here and will prefer to emphasize the differences rather than\nthe common characters of these groups, a view which corresponds with\ntheir preferred judgment of inversions. But no matter what divisions may\nbe set up, it cannot be overlooked that all transitions are abundantly\nmet with, so that the formation of a series would seem to impose itself.\n*Conception of Inversion.*--The first attention bestowed upon inversion\ngave rise to the conception that it was a congenital sign of nervous\ndegeneration. This harmonized with the fact that doctors first met it\namong the nervous, or among persons giving such an impression. There are\ntwo elements which should be considered independently in this\nconception: the congenitality, and the degeneration.\n*Degeneration.*--This term _degeneration_ is open to the objections\nwhich may be urged against the promiscuous use of this word in general.\nIt has in fact become customary to designate all morbid manifestations\nnot of traumatic or infectious origin as degenerative. Indeed, Magnan's\nclassification of degenerates makes it possible that the highest general\nconfiguration of nervous accomplishment need not exclude the application\nof the concept of degeneration. Under the circumstances, it is a\nquestion what use and what new content the judgment of \"degeneration\"\nstill possesses. It would seem more appropriate not to speak of\ndegeneration: (1) Where there are not many marked deviations from the\nnormal; (2) where the capacity for working and living do not in general\nappear markedly impaired.[6]\nThat the inverted are not degenerates in this qualified sense can be\nseen from the following facts:\n1. The inversion is found among persons who otherwise show no marked\ndeviation from the normal.\n2. It is found also among persons whose capabilities are not disturbed,\nwho on the contrary are distinguished by especially high intellectual\ndevelopment and ethical culture.[7]\n3. If one disregards the patients of one's own practice and strives to\ncomprehend a wider field of experience, he will in two directions\nencounter facts which will prevent him from assuming inversions as a\ndegenerative sign.\n(_a_) It must be considered that inversion was a frequent manifestation\namong the ancient nations at the height of their culture. It was an\ninstitution endowed with important functions. (_b_) It is found to be\nunusually prevalent among savages and primitive races, whereas the term\ndegeneration is generally limited to higher civilization (I. Bloch).\nEven among the most civilized nations of Europe, climate and race have a\nmost powerful influence on the distribution of, and attitude toward,\ninversion.[8]\n*Innateness.*--Only for the first and most extreme class of inverts, as\ncan be imagined, has innateness been claimed, and this from their own\nassurance that at no time in their life has their sexual impulse\nfollowed a different course. The fact of the existence of two other\nclasses, especially of the third, is difficult to reconcile with the\nassumption of its being congenital. Hence, the propensity of those\nholding this view to separate the group of absolute inverts from the\nothers results in the abandonment of the general conception of\ninversion. Accordingly in a number of cases the inversion would be of a\ncongenital character, while in others it might originate from other\ncauses.\nIn contradistinction to this conception is that which assumes inversion\nto be an _acquired_ character of the sexual impulse. It is based on the\nfollowing facts. (1) In many inverts (even absolute ones) an early\naffective sexual impression can be demonstrated, as a result of which\nthe homosexual inclination developed. (2) In many others outer\ninfluences of a promoting and inhibiting nature can be demonstrated,\nwhich in earlier or later life led to a fixation of the inversion--among\nwhich are exclusive relations with the same sex, companionship in war,\ndetention in prison, dangers of hetero-sexual intercourse, celibacy,\nsexual weakness, etc. (3) Hypnotic suggestion may remove the inversion,\nwhich would be surprising in that of a congenital character.\nIn view of all this, the existence of congenital inversion can certainly\nbe questioned. The objection may be made to it that a more accurate\nexamination of those claimed to be congenitally inverted will probably\nshow that the direction of the libido was determined by a definite\nexperience of early childhood, which has not been retained in the\nconscious memory of the person, but which can be brought back to memory\nby proper influences (Havelock Ellis). According to that author\ninversion can be designated only as a frequent variation of the sexual\nimpulse which may be determined by a number of external circumstances of\nlife.\nThe apparent certainty thus reached is, however, overthrown by the\nretort that manifestly there are many persons who have experienced even\nin their early youth those very sexual influences, such as seduction,\nmutual onanism, without becoming inverts, or without constantly\nremaining so. Hence, one is forced to assume that the alternatives\ncongenital and acquired are either incomplete or do not cover the\ncircumstances present in inversions.\n*Explanation of Inversion.*--The nature of inversion is explained\nneither by the assumption that it is congenital nor that it is acquired.\nIn the first case, we need to be told what there is in it of the\ncongenital, unless we are satisfied with the roughest explanation,\nnamely, that a person brings along a congenital sexual impulse connected\nwith a definite sexual object. In the second case it is a question\nwhether the manifold accidental influences suffice to explain the\nacquisition unless there is something in the individual to meet them\nhalf way. The negation of this last factor is inadmissible according to\nour former conclusions.\n*The Relation of Bisexuality.*--Since the time of Frank Lydston,\nKiernan, and Chevalier, a new series of ideas has been introduced for\nthe explanation of the possibility of sexual inversion. This contains a\nnew contradiction to the popular belief which assumes that a human being\nis either a man or a woman. Science shows cases in which the sexual\ncharacteristics appear blurred and thus the sexual distinction is made\ndifficult, especially on an anatomical basis. The genitals of such\npersons unite the male and female characteristics (hermaphroditism). In\nrare cases both parts of the sexual apparatus are well developed (true\nhermaphroditism), but usually both are stunted.[9]\nThe importance of these abnormalities lies in the fact that they\nunexpectedly facilitate the understanding of the normal formation. A\ncertain degree of anatomical hermaphroditism really belongs to the\nnormal. In no normally formed male or female are traces of the apparatus\nof the other sex lacking; these either continue functionless as\nrudimentary organs, or they are transformed for the purpose of assuming\nother functions.\nThe conception which we gather from this long known anatomical fact is\nthe original predisposition to bisexuality, which in the course of\ndevelopment has changed to monosexuality, leaving slight remnants of the\nstunted sex.\nIt was natural to transfer this conception to the psychic sphere and to\nconceive the inversion in its aberrations as an expression of psychic\nhermaphroditism. In order to bring the question to a decision, it was\nonly necessary to have one other circumstance, viz., a regular\nconcurrence of the inversion with the psychic and somatic signs of\nhermaphroditism.\nBut this second expectation was not realized. The relations between the\nassumed psychical and the demonstrable anatomical androgyny should never\nbe conceived as being so close. There is frequently found in the\ninverted a diminution of the sexual impulse (H. Ellis) and a slight\nanatomical stunting of the organs. This, however, is found frequently\nbut by no means regularly or preponderately. Thus we must recognize that\ninversion and somatic hermaphroditism are totally independent of each\nother.\nGreat importance has also been attached to the so-called secondary and\ntertiary sex characters and their aggregate occurrence in the inverted\nhas been emphasized (H. Ellis). There is much truth in this but it\nshould not be forgotten that the secondary and tertiary sex\ncharacteristics very frequently manifest themselves in the other sex,\nthus indicating androgyny without, however, involving changes in the\nsexual object in the sense of an inversion.\nPsychic hermaphroditism would gain in substantiality if parallel with\nthe inversion of the sexual object there should be at least a change in\nthe other psychic qualities, such as in the impulses and distinguishing\ntraits characteristic of the other sex. But such inversion of character\ncan be expected with some regularity only in inverted women; in men the\nmost perfect psychic manliness may be united with the inversion. If one\nfirmly adheres to the hypothesis of a psychic hermaphroditism, one must\nadd that in certain spheres its manifestations allow the recognition of\nonly a very slight contrary determination. The same also holds true in\nthe somatic androgyny. According to Halban, the appearance of individual\nstunted organs and secondary sex characters are quite independent of\neach other.[10]\nA spokesman of the masculine inverts stated the bisexual theory in its\ncrudest form in the following words: \"It is a female brain in a male\nbody.\" But we do not know the characteristics of a \"female brain.\" The\nsubstitution of the anatomical for the psychological is as frivolous as\nit is unjustified. The tentative explanation by v. Krafft-Ebing seems to\nbe more precisely formulated than that of Ulrich but does not\nessentially differ from it. v. Krafft-Ebing thinks that the bisexual\npredisposition gives to the individual male and female brain centers as\nwell as somatic sexual organs. These centers develop first towards\npuberty mostly under the influence of the independent sex glands. We\ncan, however, say the same of the male and female \"centers\" as of the\nmale and female brains; and, moreover, we do not even know whether we\ncan assume for the sexual functions separate brain locations (\"centers\")\nsuch as we may assume for language.\nAfter this discussion, two notions, at all events, persist; first, that\na bisexual predisposition is to be presumed for the inversion also, only\nwe do not know of what it consists beyond the anatomical formations;\nand, second, that we are dealing with disturbances which are experienced\nby the sexual impulse during its development.[11]\n*The Sexual Object of Inverts.*--The theory of psychic hermaphroditism\npresupposed that the sexual object of the inverted is the reverse of the\nnormal. The inverted man, like the woman, succumbs to the charms\nemanating from manly qualities of body and mind; he feels himself like a\nwoman and seeks a man.\nBut however true this may be for a great number of inverts, it by no\nmeans indicates the general character of inversion. There is no doubt\nthat a great part of the male inverted have retained the psychic\ncharacter of virility, that proportionately they show but little of the\nsecondary characters of the other sex, and that they really look for\nreal feminine psychic features in their sexual object. If that were not\nso it would be incomprehensible why masculine prostitution, in offering\nitself to inverts, copies in all its exterior, to-day as in antiquity,\nthe dress and attitudes of woman. This imitation would otherwise be an\ninsult to the ideal of the inverts. Among the Greeks, where the most\nmanly men were found among inverts, it is quite obvious that it was not\nthe masculine character of the boy which kindled the love of man, but it\nwas his physical resemblance to woman as well as his feminine psychic\nqualities, such as shyness, demureness, and the need of instruction and\nhelp. As soon as the boy himself became a man he ceased to be a sexual\nobject for men and in turn became a lover of boys. The sexual object in\nthis case as in many others is therefore not of the like sex, but it\nunites both sex characters, a compromise between the impulses striving\nfor the man and for the woman, but firmly conditioned by the masculinity\nof body (the genitals).[12]\nThe conditions in the woman are more definite; here the active inverts,\nwith special frequency, show the somatic and psychic characters of man\nand desire femininity in their sexual object; though even here greater\nvariation will be found on more intimate investigation.\n*The Sexual Aim of Inverts.*--The important fact to bear in mind is that\nno uniformity of the sexual aim can be attributed to inversion.\nIntercourse per anum in men by no means goes with inversion;\nmasturbation is just as frequently the exclusive aim; and the limitation\nof the sexual aim to mere effusion of feelings is here even more\nfrequent than in hetero-sexual love. In women, too, the sexual aims of\nthe inverted are manifold, among which contact with the mucous membrane\nof the mouth seems to be preferred.\n*Conclusion.*--Though from the material on hand we are by no means in a\nposition satisfactorily to explain the origin of inversion, we can say\nthat through this investigation we have obtained an insight which can\nbecome of greater significance to us than the solution of the above\nproblem. Our attention is called to the fact that we have assumed a too\nclose connection between the sexual impulse and the sexual object. The\nexperience gained from the so called abnormal cases teaches us that a\nconnection exists between the sexual impulse and the sexual object which\nwe are in danger of overlooking in the uniformity of normal states where\nthe impulse seems to bring with it the object. We are thus instructed to\nseparate this connection between the impulse and the object. The sexual\nimpulse is probably entirely independent of its object and is not\noriginated by the stimuli proceeding from the object.\nB. _The Sexually Immature and Animals as Sexual Objects_\nWhereas those sexual inverts whose sexual object does not belong to the\nnormally adapted sex, appear to the observer as a collective number of\nperhaps otherwise normal individuals, the persons who choose for their\nsexual object the sexually immature (children) are apparently from the\nfirst sporadic aberrations. Only exceptionally are children the\nexclusive sexual objects. They are mostly drawn into this r\u00f4le by a\nfaint-hearted and impotent individual who makes use of such substitutes,\nor when an impulsive urgent desire cannot at the time secure the proper\nobject. Still it throws some light on the nature of the sexual impulse,\nthat it should suffer such great variation and depreciation of its\nobject, a thing which hunger, adhering more energetically to its object,\nwould allow only in the most extreme cases. The same may be said of\nsexual relations with animals--a thing not at all rare among\nfarmers--where the sexual attraction goes beyond the limits of the\nspecies.\nFor esthetic reasons one would fain attribute this and other excessive\naberrations of the sexual impulse to the insane, but this cannot be\ndone. Experience teaches that among the latter no disturbances of the\nsexual impulse can be found other than those observed among the sane, or\namong whole races and classes. Thus we find with gruesome frequency\nsexual abuse of children by teachers and servants merely because they\nhave the best opportunities for it. The insane present the aforesaid\naberration only in a somewhat intensified form; or what is of special\nsignificance is the fact that the aberration becomes exclusive and takes\nthe place of the normal sexual gratification.\nThis very remarkable relation of sexual variations ranging from the\nnormal to the insane gives material for reflection. It seems to me that\nthe fact to be explained would show that the impulses of the sexual life\nbelong to those which even normally are most poorly controlled by the\nhigher psychic activities. He who is in any way psychically abnormal, be\nit in social or ethical conditions, is, according to my experience,\nregularly so in his sexual life. But many are abnormal in their sexual\nlife who in every other respect correspond to the average; they have\nfollowed the human cultural development, but sexuality remained as their\nweak point.\nAs a general result of these discussions we come to see that, under\nnumerous conditions and among a surprising number of individuals, the\nnature and value of the sexual object steps into the background. There\nis something else in the sexual impulse which is the essential and\nconstant.[13]\n2. DEVIATION IN REFERENCE TO THE SEXUAL AIM\nThe union of the genitals in the characteristic act of copulation is\ntaken as the normal sexual aim. It serves to loosen the sexual tension\nand temporarily to quench the sexual desire (gratification analogous to\nsatisfaction of hunger). Yet even in the most normal sexual process\nthose additions are distinguishable, the development of which leads to\nthe aberrations described as _perversions_. Thus certain intermediary\nrelations to the sexual object connected with copulation, such as\ntouching and looking, are recognized as preliminary to the sexual aim.\nThese activities are on the one hand themselves connected with pleasure\nand on the other hand they enhance the excitement which persists until\nthe definite sexual aim is reached. One definite kind of contiguity,\nconsisting of mutual approximation of the mucous membranes of the lips\nin the form of a kiss, has received among the most civilized nations a\nsexual value, though the parts of the body concerned do not belong to\nthe sexual apparatus but form the entrance to the digestive tract. This\ntherefore supplies the factors which allow us to bring the perversions\ninto relation with the normal sexual life, and which are available also\nfor their classification. The perversions are either (_a_) anatomical\n_transgressions_ of the bodily regions destined for sexual union, or (_b_)\na _lingering_ at the intermediary relations to the sexual object which\nshould normally be rapidly passed on the way to the definite sexual aim.\n(_a_) _Anatomical Transgression_\n*Overestimation of the Sexual Object.*--The psychic estimation in which\nthe sexual object as a goal of the sexual impulse shares is only in the\nrarest cases limited to the genitals; generally it embraces the whole\nbody and tends to include all sensations emanating from the sexual\nobject. The same overestimation spreads over the psychic sphere and\nmanifests itself as a logical blinding (diminished judgment) in the face\nof the psychic attainments and perfections of the sexual object, as well\nas a blind obedience to the judgments issuing from the latter. The full\nfaith of love thus becomes an important, if not the primordial source of\nauthority.[14]\nIt is this sexual overvaluation, which so ill agrees with the\nrestriction of the sexual aim to the union of the genitals only, that\nassists other parts of the body to participate as sexual aims.[15] In\nthe development of this most manifold anatomical overestimation there is\nan unmistakable desire towards variation, a thing denominated by Hoche\nas \"excitement-hunger\" (Reiz-hunger).[16]\n*Sexual Utilization of the Mucous Membrane of the Lips and Mouth.*--The\nsignificance of the factor of sexual overestimation can be best studied\nin the man, in whom alone the sexual life is accessible to\ninvestigation, whereas in the woman it is veiled in impenetrable\ndarkness, partly in consequence of cultural stunting and partly on\naccount of the conventional reticence and dishonesty of women.\nThe employment of the mouth as a sexual organ is considered as a\nperversion if the lips (tongue) of the one are brought into contact with\nthe genitals of the other, but not when the mucous membrane of the lips\nof both touch each other. In the latter exception we find the connection\nwith the normal. He who abhors the former as perversions, though these\nsince antiquity have been common practices among mankind, yields to a\ndistinct _feeling of loathing_ which protects him from adopting such\nsexual aims. The limit of such loathing is frequently purely\nconventional; he who kisses fervently the lips of a pretty girl will\nperhaps be able to use her tooth brush only with a sense of loathing,\nthough there is no reason to assume that his own oral cavity for which\nhe entertains no loathing is cleaner than that of the girl. Our\nattention is here called to the factor of loathing which stands in the\nway of the libidinous overestimation of the sexual aim, but which may\nin turn be vanquished by the libido. In the loathing we may observe one\nof the forces which have brought about the restrictions of the sexual\naim. As a rule these forces halt at the genitals; there is, however, no\ndoubt that even the genitals of the other sex themselves may be an\nobject of loathing. Such behavior is characteristic of all hysterics,\nespecially women. The force of the sexual impulse prefers to occupy\nitself with the overcoming of this loathing (see below).\n*Sexual Utilization of the Anal Opening.*--It is even more obvious than\nin the former case that it is the loathing which stamps as a perversion\nthe use of the anus as a sexual aim. But it should not be interpreted as\nespousing a cause when I observe that the basis of this\nloathing--namely, that this part of the body serves for the excretion\nand comes in contact with the loathsome excrement--is not more plausible\nthan the basis which hysterical girls have for the disgust which they\nentertain for the male genital because it serves for urination.\nThe sexual r\u00f4le of the mucous membrane of the anus is by no means\nlimited to intercourse between men; its preference has nothing\ncharacteristic of the inverted feeling. On the contrary, it seems that\nthe _pedicatio_ of the man owes its r\u00f4le to the analogy with the act in\nthe woman, whereas among inverts it is mutual masturbation which is the\nmost common sexual aim.\n*The Significance of Other Parts of the Body.*--Sexual infringement on\nthe other parts of the body, in all its variations, offers nothing new;\nit adds nothing to our knowledge of the sexual impulse which herein only\nannounces its intention to dominate the sexual object in every way.\nBesides the sexual overvaluation, a second and generally unknown factor\nmay be mentioned among the anatomical transgressions. Certain parts of\nthe body, like the mucous membrane of the mouth and anus, which\nrepeatedly appear in such practices, lay claim as it were to be\nconsidered and treated as genitals. We shall hear how this claim is\njustified by the development of the sexual impulse, and how it is\nfulfilled in the symptomatology of certain morbid conditions.\n*Unfit Substitutes for the Sexual Object. Fetichism.*--We are especially\nimpressed by those cases in which for the normal sexual object another\nis substituted which is related to it but which is totally unfit for the\nnormal sexual aim. According to the scheme of the introduction we should\nhave done better to mention this most interesting group of aberrations\nof the sexual impulse among the deviations in reference to the sexual\nobject, but we have deferred mention of these until we became acquainted\nwith the factor of sexual overestimation, upon which these\nmanifestations, connected with the relinquishing of the sexual aim,\ndepend.\nThe substitute for the sexual object is generally a part of the body but\nlittle adapted for sexual purposes, such as the foot, or hair, or an\ninanimate object which is in demonstrable relation with the sexual\nperson, and preferably with the sexuality of the same (fragments of\nclothing, white underwear). This substitution is not unjustly compared\nwith the fetich in which the savage sees the embodiment of his god.\nThe transition to the cases of fetichism, with a renunciation of a\nnormal or of a perverted sexual aim, is formed by cases in which a\nfetichistic determination is demanded in the sexual object if the sexual\naim is to be attained (definite color of hair, clothing, even physical\nblemishes). No other variation of the sexual impulse verging on the\npathological claims our interest as much as this one, owing to the\npeculiarity occasioned by its manifestations. A certain diminution in\nthe striving for the normal sexual aim may be presupposed in all these\ncases (executive weakness of the sexual apparatus).[17] The connection\nwith the normal is occasioned by the psychologically necessary\noverestimation of the sexual object, which inevitably encroaches upon\neverything associatively related to it (sexual object). A certain degree\nof such fetichism therefore regularly belong to the normal, especially\nduring those stages of wooing when the normal sexual aim seems\ninaccessible or its realization deferred.\n\"Get me a handkerchief from her bosom--a garter of my love.\"\n--FAUST.\nThe case becomes pathological only when the striving for the fetich\nfixes itself beyond such determinations and takes the place of the\nnormal sexual aim; or again, when the fetich disengages itself from the\nperson concerned and itself becomes a sexual object. These are the\ngeneral determinations for the transition of mere variations of the\nsexual impulse into pathological aberrations.\nThe persistent influence of a sexual impress mostly received in early\nchildhood often shows itself in the selection of a fetich, as Binet\nfirst asserted, and as was later proven by many illustrations,--a thing\nwhich may be placed parallel to the proverbial attachment to a first\nlove in the normal (\"On revient toujours \u00e0 ses premiers amours\"). Such a\nconnection is especially seen in cases with only fetichistic\ndeterminations of the sexual object. The significance of early sexual\nimpressions will be met again in other places.\nIn other cases it was mostly a symbolic thought association, unconscious\nto the person concerned, which led to the replacing of the object by\nmeans of a fetich. The paths of these connections can not always be\ndefinitely demonstrated. The foot is a very primitive sexual symbol\nalready found in myths.[18] Fur is used as a fetich probably on account\nof its association with the hairiness of the mons veneris. Such\nsymbolism seems often to depend on sexual experiences in childhood.[19]\n(_b_) _Fixation of Precursory Sexual Aims_\n*The Appearance of New Intentions.*--All the outer and inner\ndeterminations which impede or hold at a distance the attainment of the\nnormal sexual aim, such as impotence, costliness of the sexual object,\nand dangers of the sexual act, will conceivably strengthen the\ninclination to linger at the preparatory acts and to form them into new\nsexual aims which may take the place of the normal. On closer\ninvestigation it is always seen that the ostensibly most peculiar of\nthese new intentions have already been indicated in the normal sexual\nact.\n*Touching and Looking.*--At least a certain amount of touching is\nindispensable for a person in order to attain the normal sexual aim. It\nis also generally known that the touching of the skin of the sexual\nobject causes much pleasure and produces a supply of new excitement.\nHence, the lingering at the touching can hardly be considered a\nperversion if the sexual act is proceeded with.\nThe same holds true in the end with looking which is analogous to\ntouching. The manner in which the libidinous excitement is frequently\nawakened is by the optical impression, and selection takes account of\nthis circumstance--if this teleological mode of thinking be\npermitted--by making the sexual object a thing of beauty. The covering\nof the body, which keeps abreast with civilization, serves to arouse\nsexual inquisitiveness, which always strives to restore for itself the\nsexual object by uncovering the hidden parts. This can be turned into\nthe artistic (\"sublimation\") if the interest is turned from the genitals\nto the form of the body.[20] The tendency to linger at this intermediary\nsexual aim of the sexually accentuated looking is found to a certain\ndegree in most normals; indeed it gives them the possibility of\ndirecting a certain amount of their libido to a higher artistic aim. On\nthe other hand, the fondness for looking becomes a perversion (_a_) when\nit limits itself entirely to the genitals; (_b_) when it becomes connected\nwith the overcoming of loathing (voyeurs and onlookers at the functions\nof excretion); and (_c_) when instead of preparing for the normal sexual\naim it suppresses it. The latter, if I may draw conclusions from a\nsingle analysis, is in a most pronounced way true of exhibitionists, who\nexpose their genitals so as in turn to bring to view the genitals of\nothers.\nIn the perversion which consists in striving to look and be looked at we\nare confronted with a very remarkable character which will occupy us\neven more intensively in the following aberration. The sexual aim is\nhere present in twofold formation, in an _active_ and a _passive_ form.\nThe force which is opposed to the peeping mania and through which it is\neventually abolished is _shame_ (like the former loathing).\n*Sadism and Masochism.*--The desire to cause pain to the sexual object\nand its opposite, the most frequent and most significant of all\nperversions, was designated in its two forms by v. Krafft-Ebing as\nsadism or the active form, and masochism or the passive form. Other\nauthors prefer the narrower term algolagnia which emphasizes the\npleasure in pain and cruelty, whereas the terms selected by v.\nKrafft-Ebing place the pleasure secured in all kinds of humility and\nsubmission in the foreground.\nThe roots of active algolagnia, sadism, can be readily demonstrable in\nthe normal. The sexuality of most men shows a taint of _aggression_, it\nis a propensity to subdue, the biological significance of which lies in\nthe necessity of overcoming the resistance of the sexual object by\nactions other than mere _courting_. Sadism would then correspond to an\naggressive component of the sexual impulse which has become independent\nand exaggerated and has been brought to the foreground by displacement.\nThe conception of sadism fluctuates in the usage of language from a mere\nactive or impetuous attitude towards the sexual object to the exclusive\nattachment of the gratification to the subjection and maltreatment of\nthe object. Strictly speaking only the last extreme case has a claim to\nthe name of perversion.\nSimilarly, the designation of masochism comprises all passive attitude\nto the sexual life and to the sexual object; in its most extreme form\nthe gratification is connected with suffering of physical or mental pain\nat the hands of the sexual object. Masochism as a perversion seems to be\nstill more remote from the normal sexual life by forming a contrast to\nit; it may be doubted whether it ever appears as a primary form or\nwhether it does not more regularly originate through transformation from\nsadism. It can often be recognized that the masochism is nothing but a\ncontinuation of the sadism turning against one's own person in which the\nlatter at first takes the place of the sexual object. Analysis of\nextreme cases of masochistic perversions show that there is a\nco\u00f6peration of a large series of factors which exaggerate and fix the\noriginal passive sexual attitude (castration complex, conscience).\nThe pain which is here overcome ranks with the loathing and shame which\nwere the resistances opposed to the libido.\nSadism and masochism occupy a special place among the perversions, for\nthe contrast of activity and passivity lying at their bases belong to\nthe common traits of the sexual life.\nThat cruelty and sexual impulse are most intimately connected is beyond\ndoubt taught by the history of civilization, but in the explanation of\nthis connection no one has gone beyond the accentuation of the\naggressive factors of the libido. The aggression which is mixed with the\nsexual impulse is according to some authors a remnant of cannibalistic\nlust, a participation on the part of the domination apparatus\n(Bem\u00e4chtigungsapparatus), which served also for the gratification of the\ngreat wants of the other, ontogenetically the older impulse.[21] It has\nalso been claimed that every pain contains in itself the possibility of\na pleasurable sensation. Let us be satisfied with the impression that\nthe explanation of this perversion is by no means satisfactory and that\nit is possible that many psychic efforts unite themselves into one\neffect.\nThe most striking peculiarity of this perversion lies in the fact that\nits active and passive forms are regularly encountered together in the\nsame person. He who experiences pleasure by causing pain to others in\nsexual relations is also able to experience the pain emanating from\nsexual relations as pleasure. A sadist is simultaneously a masochist,\nthough either the active or the passive side of the perversion may be\nmore strongly developed and thus represent his preponderate sexual\nactivity.[22]\nWe thus see that certain perverted propensities regularly appear in\n_contrasting pairs_, a thing which, in view of the material to be\nproduced later, must claim great theoretical value. It is furthermore\nclear that the existence of the contrast, sadism and masochism, can not\nreadily be attributed to the mixture of aggression. On the other hand\none may be tempted to connect such simultaneously existing contrasts\nwith the united contrast of male and female in bisexuality, the\nsignificance of which is reduced in psychoanalysis to the contrast of\nactivity and passivity.\n3. GENERAL STATEMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL PERVERSIONS\n*Variation and Disease.*--The physicians who at first studied the\n_perversions_ in pronounced cases and under peculiar conditions were\nnaturally inclined to attribute to them the character of a morbid or\ndegenerative sign similar to the _inversions_. This view, however, is\neasier to refute in this than in the former case. Everyday experience\nhas shown that most of these transgressions, at least the milder ones,\nare seldom wanting as components in the sexual life of normals who look\nupon them as upon other intimacies. Wherever the conditions are\nfavorable such a perversion may for a long time be substituted by a\nnormal person for the normal sexual aim or it may be placed near it. In\nno normal person does the normal sexual aim lack some designable\nperverse element, and this universality suffices in itself to prove the\ninexpediency of an opprobrious application of the name perversion. In\nthe realm of the sexual life one is sure to meet with exceptional\ndifficulties which are at present really unsolvable, if one wishes to\ndraw a sharp line between the mere variations within physiological\nlimits and morbid symptoms.\nNevertheless, the quality of the new sexual aim in some of these\nperversions is such as to require special notice. Some of the\nperversions are in content so distant from the normal that we cannot\nhelp calling them \"morbid,\" especially those in which the sexual\nimpulse, in overcoming the resistances (shame, loathing, fear, and pain)\nhas brought about surprising results (licking of feces and violation of\ncadavers). Yet even in these cases one ought not to feel certain of\nregularly finding among the perpetrators persons of pronounced\nabnormalities or insane minds. We can not lose sight of the fact that\npersons who otherwise behave normally are recorded as sick in the realm\nof the sexual life where they are dominated by the most unbridled of all\nimpulses. On the other hand, a manifest abnormality in any other\nrelation in life generally shows an undercurrent of abnormal sexual\nbehavior.\nIn the majority of cases we are able to find the morbid character of the\nperversion not in the content of the new sexual aim but in its relation\nto the normal. It is morbid if the perversion does not appear beside the\nnormal (sexual aim and sexual object), where favorable circumstances\npromote it and unfavorable impede the normal, or if it has under all\ncircumstances repressed and supplanted the normal; _the exclusiveness_\nand _fixation_ of the perversion justifies us in considering it a morbid\nsymptom.\n*The Psychic Participation in the Perversions.*--Perhaps it is precisely\nin the most abominable perversions that we must recognize the most\nprolific psychic participation for the transformation of the sexual\nimpulse. In these cases a piece of psychic work has been accomplished in\nwhich, in spite of its gruesome success, the value of an idealization of\nthe impulse can not be disputed. The omnipotence of love nowhere perhaps\nshows itself stronger than in this one of her aberrations. The highest\nand the lowest everywhere in sexuality hang most intimately together.\n(\"From heaven through the world to hell.\")\n*Two Results.*--In the study of perversions we have gained an insight\ninto the fact that the sexual impulse has to struggle against certain\npsychic forces, resistances, among which shame and loathing are most\nprominent. We may presume that these forces are employed to confine the\nimpulse within the accepted normal limits, and if they have become\ndeveloped in the individual before the sexual impulse has attained its\nfull strength, it is really they which have directed it in the course of\ndevelopment.[23]\nWe have furthermore remarked that some of the examined perversions can\nbe comprehended only by assuming the union of many motives. If they are\namenable to analysis--disintegration--they must be of a composite\nnature. This may give us a hint that the sexual impulse itself may not\nbe something simple, that it may on the contrary be composed of many\ncomponents which detach themselves to form perversions. Our clinical\nobservation thus calls our attention to _fusions_ which have lost their\nexpression in the uniform normal behavior.\n4. THE SEXUAL IMPULSE IN NEUROTICS\n*Psychoanalysis.*--A proper contribution to the knowledge of the sexual\nimpulse in persons who are at least related to the normal can be gained\nonly from one source, and is accessible only by one definite path. There\nis only one way to obtain a thorough and unerring solution of problems\nin the sexual life of so-called psychoneurotics (hysteria, obsessions,\nthe wrongly-named neurasthenia, and surely also dementia pr\u00e6cox, and\nparanoia), and that is by subjecting them to the psychoanalytic\ninvestigations propounded by J. Breuer and myself in 1893, which we\ncalled the \"cathartic\" treatment.\nI must repeat what I have said in my published work, that these\npsychoneuroses, as far as my experience goes, are based on sexual motive\npowers. I do not mean that the energy of the sexual impulse merely\ncontributes to the forces supporting the morbid manifestations\n(symptoms), but I wish distinctly to maintain that this supplies the\nonly constant and the most important source of energy in the neurosis,\nso that the sexual life of such persons manifests itself either\nexclusively, preponderately, or partially in these symptoms. As I have\nalready stated in different places, the symptoms are the sexual\nactivities of the patient. The proof for this assertion I have obtained\nfrom the psychoanalysis of hysterics and other neurotics during a period\nof twenty years, the results of which I hope to give later in a detailed\naccount.\nPsychoanalysis removes the symptoms of hysteria on the supposition that\nthey are the substitutes--the transcriptions as it were--for a series of\nemotionally accentuated psychic processes, wishes, and desires, to which\na passage for their discharge through the conscious psychic activities\nhas been cut off by a special process (repression). These thought\nformations which are restrained in the state of the unconscious strive\nfor expression, that is, for _discharge_, in conformity to their\naffective value, and find such in hysteria through a process of\n_conversion_ into somatic phenomena--the hysterical symptoms. If, _lege\nartis_, and with the aid of a special technique, retrogressive\ntransformations of the symptoms into the affectful and conscious\nthoughts can be effected, it then becomes possible to get the most\naccurate information about the nature and origin of these previously\nunconscious psychic formations.\n*Results of Psychoanalysis.*--In this manner it has been discovered that\nthe symptoms represent the equivalent for the strivings which received\ntheir strength from the source of the sexual impulse. This fully concurs\nwith what we know of the character of hysterics, which we have taken as\nmodels for all psycho-neurotics, before they have become diseased, and\nwith what we know concerning the causes of the disease. The hysterical\ncharacter evinces a part of sexual repression which reaches beyond the\nnormal limits, an exaggeration of the resistances against the sexual\nimpulse which we know as shame and loathing. It is an instinctive flight\nfrom intellectual occupation with the sexual problem, the consequence of\nwhich in pronounced cases is a complete sexual ignorance, which is\npreserved till the age of sexual maturity is attained.[24]\nThis feature, so characteristic of hysteria, is not seldom concealed in\ncrude observation by the existence of the second constitutional factor\nof hysteria, namely, the enormous development of the sexual craving. But\nthe psychological analysis will always reveal it and solves the very\ncontradictory enigma of hysteria by proving the existence of the\ncontrasting pair, an immense sexual desire and a very exaggerated sexual\nrejection.\nThe provocation of the disease in hysterically predisposed persons is\nbrought about if in consequence of their progressive maturity or\nexternal conditions of life they are earnestly confronted with the real\nsexual demand. Between the pressure of the craving and the opposition of\nthe sexual rejection an outlet for the disease results, which does not\nremove the conflict but seeks to elude it by transforming the libidinous\nstrivings into symptoms. It is an exception only in appearance if a\nhysterical person, say a man, becomes subject to some banal emotional\ndisturbance, to a conflict in the center of which there is no sexual\ninterest. Psychoanalysis will regularly show that it is the sexual\ncomponents of the conflict which make the disease possible by\nwithdrawing the psychic processes from normal adjustment.\n*Neurosis and Perversion.*--A great part of the opposition to my\nassertion is explained by the fact that the sexuality from which I\ndeduce the psychoneurotic symptoms is thought of as coincident with the\nnormal sexual impulse. But psychoanalysis teaches us better than this.\nIt shows that the symptoms do not by any means result at the expense\nonly of the so called normal sexual impulse (at least not exclusively or\npreponderately), but they represent the converted expression of impulses\nwhich in a broader sense might be designated as _perverse_ if they could\nmanifest themselves directly in phantasies and acts without deviating\nfrom consciousness. The symptoms are therefore partially formed at the\ncost of abnormal sexuality. _The neurosis is, so to say, the negative of\nthe perversion._[25]\nThe sexual impulse of the psychoneurotic shows all the aberrations which\nwe have studied as variations of the normal and as manifestations of\nmorbid sexual life.\n(_a_) In all the neurotics without exception we find feelings of inversion\nin the unconscious psychic life, fixation of libido on persons of the\nsame sex. It is impossible, without a deep and searching discussion,\nadequately to appreciate the significance of this factor for the\nformation of the picture of the disease; I can only assert that the\nunconscious propensity to inversion is never wanting and is particularly\nof immense service in explaining male hysteria.[26]\n(_b_) All the inclinations to anatomical transgression can be demonstrated\nin psychoneurotics in the unconscious and as symptom-creators. Of\nspecial frequency and intensity are those which impart to the mouth and\nthe mucous membrane of the anus the r\u00f4le of genitals.\n(_c_) The partial desires which usually appear in contrasting pairs play\na very prominent r\u00f4le among the symptom-creators in the psychoneuroses.\nWe have learned to know them as carriers of new sexual aims, such as\npeeping mania, exhibitionism, and the actively and passively formed\nimpulses of cruelty. The contribution of the last is indispensable for\nthe understanding of the morbid nature of the symptoms; it almost\nregularly controls some portion of the social behavior of the patient.\nThe transformation of love into hatred, of tenderness into hostility,\nwhich is characteristic of a large number of neurotic cases and\napparently of all cases of paranoia, takes place by means of the union\nof cruelty with the libido.\nThe interest in these deductions will be more heightened by certain\npeculiarities of the diagnosis of facts.\nAlpha. There is nothing in the unconscious streams of thought of\nthe neuroses which would correspond to an inclination towards fetichism;\na circumstance which throws light on the psychological peculiarity of\nthis well understood perversion.\nBeta. Wherever any such impulse is found in the unconscious which\ncan be paired with a contrasting one, it can regularly be demonstrated\nthat the latter, too, is effective. Every active perversion is here\naccompanied by its passive counterpart. He who in the unconscious is an\nexhibitionist is at the same time a voyeur, he who suffers from sadistic\nfeelings as a result of repression will also show another reinforcement\nof the symptoms from the source of masochistic tendencies. The perfect\nconcurrence with the behavior of the corresponding positive perversions\nis certainly very noteworthy. In the picture of the disease, however,\nthe preponderant r\u00f4le is played by either one or the other of the\nopposing tendencies.\nGamma. In a pronounced case of psychoneurosis we seldom find the\ndevelopment of one single perverted impulse; usually there are many and\nregularly there are traces of all perversions. The individual impulse,\nhowever, on account of its intensity, is independent of the development\nof the others, but the study of the positive perversions gives us the\naccurate counterpart to it.\nPARTIAL IMPULSES AND EROGENOUS ZONES\nKeeping in mind what we have learned from the examination of the\npositive and negative perversions, it becomes quite obvious that they\ncan be referred to a number of \"partial impulses,\" which are not,\nhowever, primary but are subject to further analysis. By an \"impulse\" we\ncan understand in the first place nothing but the psychic representative\nof a continually flowing internal somatic source of excitement, in\ncontradistinction to the \"stimulus\" which is produced by isolated\nexcitements coming from without. The impulse is thus one of the concepts\nmarking the limits between the psychic and the physical. The simplest\nand most obvious assumption concerning the nature of the impulses would\nbe that in themselves they possess no quality but are only taken into\naccount as a measure of the demand for effort in the psychic life. What\ndistinguishes the impulses from one another and furnishes them with\nspecific attributes is their relation to their somatic _sources_ and to\ntheir _aims_. The source of the impulse is an exciting process in an\norgan, and the immediate aim of the impulse lies in the elimination of\nthis organic stimulus.\nAnother preliminary assumption in the theory of the impulse which we\ncannot relinquish, states that the bodily organs furnish two kinds of\nexcitements which are determined by differences of a chemical nature.\nOne of these forms of excitement we designate as the specifically sexual\nand the concerned organ as the _erogenous zone_, while the sexual\nelement emanating from it is the partial impulse.[27]\nIn the perversions which claim sexual significance for the oral cavity\nand the anal opening the part played by the erogenous zone is quite\nobvious. It behaves in every way like a part of the sexual apparatus. In\nhysteria these parts of the body, as well as the tracts of mucous\nmembrane proceeding from them, become the seat of new sensations and\ninnervating changes in a manner similar to the real genitals when under\nthe excitement of normal sexual processes.\nThe significance of the erogenous zones in the psychoneuroses, as\nadditional apparatus and substitutes for the genitals, appears to be\nmost prominent in hysteria though that does not signify that it is of\nlesser validity in the other morbid forms. It is not so recognizable in\ncompulsion neurosis and paranoia because here the symptom formation\ntakes place in regions of the psychic apparatus which lie at a great\ndistance from the central locations for bodily control. The more\nremarkable thing in the compulsion neurosis is the significance of the\nimpulses which create new sexual aims and appear independently of the\nerogenous zones. Nevertheless, the eye corresponds to an erogenous zone\nin the looking and exhibition mania, while the skin takes on the same\npart in the pain and cruelty components of the sexual impulse. The skin,\nwhich in special parts of the body becomes differentiated as sensory\norgans and modified by the mucous membrane, is the erogenous zone,\n[Greek: kat] ex ogen.[28]\nEXPLANATION OF THE MANIFEST PREPONDERANCE OF SEXUAL PERVERSIONS IN THE\nPSYCHONEUROSES\nThe sexuality of psychoneurotics has perhaps been placed in a false\nlight by the above discussions. It appears that the sexual behavior of\nthe psychoneurotic approaches in predisposition to the pervert and\ndeviates by just so much from the normal. Nevertheless, it is very\npossible that the constitutional disposition of these patients besides\ncontaining an immense amount of sexual repression and a predominant\nforce of sexual impulse also possesses an unusual tendency to\nperversions in the broadest sense. However, an examination of milder\ncases shows that the last assumption is not an absolute requisite, or at\nleast that in pronouncing judgment on the morbid effects one ought to\ndiscount the effect of one of the factors. In most psychoneurotics the\ndisease first appears after puberty following the demands of the normal\nsexual life. Against these the repression above all directs itself. Or\nthe disease comes on later, owing to the fact that the libido is unable\nto attain normal sexual gratification. In both cases the libido behaves\nlike a stream the principal bed of which is dammed; it fills the\ncollateral roads which until now perhaps have been empty. Thus the\nmanifestly great (though to be sure negative) tendency to perversion in\npsychoneurotics may be collaterally conditioned; at any rate, it is\ncertainly collaterally increased. The fact of the matter is that the\nsexual repression has to be added as an inner factor to such external\nones as restriction of freedom, inaccessibility to the normal sexual\nobject, dangers of the normal sexual act, etc., which cause the origin\nof perversions in individuals who might have otherwise remained normal.\nIn individual cases of neurosis the behavior may be different; now the\ncongenital force of the tendency to perversion may be more decisive and\nat other times more influence may be exerted by the collateral increase\nof the same through the deviation of the libido from the normal sexual\naim and object. It would be unjust to construe a contrast where a\ncooperation exists. The greatest results will always be brought about by\na neurosis if constitution and experience cooperate in the same\ndirection. A pronounced constitution may perhaps be able to dispense\nwith the assistance of daily impressions, while a profound disturbance\nin life may perhaps bring on a neurosis even in an average constitution.\nThese views similarly hold true in the etiological significance\nof the congenital and the accidental experiences in other spheres.\nIf, however, preference is given to the assumption that an especially\nformed tendency to perversions is characteristic of the psychoneurotic\nconstitution, there is a prospect of being able to distinguish a\nmultiformity of such constitutions in accordance with the congenital\npreponderance of this or that erogenous zone, or of this or that partial\nimpulse. Whether there is a special relationship between the\npredisposition to perversions and the selection of the morbid picture\nhas not, like many other things in this realm, been investigated.\nREFERENCE TO THE INFANTILISM OF SEXUALITY\nBy demonstrating the perverted feelings as symptomatic formations in\npsychoneurotics, we have enormously increased the number of persons who\ncan be added to the perverts. This is not only because neurotics\nrepresent a very large proportion of humanity, but we must consider also\nthat the neuroses in all their gradations run in an uninterrupted series\nto the normal state. Moebius was quite justified in saying that we are\nall somewhat hysterical. Hence, the very wide dissemination of\nperversions urged us to assume that the predisposition to perversions is\nno rare peculiarity but must form a part of the normally accepted\nconstitution.\nWe have heard that it is a question whether perversions should be\nreferred to congenital determinations or whether they originate from\naccidental experiences, just as Binet showed in fetichisms. Now we are\nforced to the conclusion that there is indeed something congenital at\nthe basis of perversions, but it is something _which is congenital in\nall persons_, which as a predisposition may fluctuate in intensity and\nis brought into prominence by influences of life. We deal here with\ncongenital roots in the constitution of the sexual impulse which in one\nseries of cases develop into real carriers of sexual activity\n(perverts); while in other cases they undergo an insufficient\nsuppression (repression), so that as morbid symptoms they are enabled to\nattract to themselves in a round-about way a considerable part of the\nsexual energy; while again in favorable cases between the two extremes\nthey originate the normal sexual life through effective restrictions and\nother elaborations.\nBut we must also remember that the assumed constitution which shows the\nroots of all perversions will be demonstrable only in the child, though\nall impulses can be manifested in it only in moderate intensity. If we\nare led to suppose that neurotics conserve the infantile state of their\nsexuality or return to it, our interest must then turn to the sexual\nlife of the child, and we will then follow the play of influences which\ncontrol the processes of development of the infantile sexuality up to\nits termination in a perversion, a neurosis or a normal sexual life.\n[1] The facts contained in the first \"Contribution\" have been gathered\nfrom the familiar publications of Krafft-Ebing, Moll, Moebius, Havelock\nEllis, Schrenk-Notzing, L\u00f6wenfeld, Eulenberg, J. Bloch, and M.\nHirschfeld, and from the later works published in the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr\nsexuelle Zwischenstufen.\" As these publications also mention the other\nliterature bearing on this subject I may forbear giving detailed\nreferences.\nThe conclusions reached through the investigation of sexual inverts are\nall based on the reports of J. Sadger and on my own experience.\n[2] For general use the word \"libido\" is best translated by \"craving.\"\n(Prof. James J. Putnam, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Vol. IV, 6.)\n[3] For the difficulties entailed in the attempt to ascertain the\nproportional number of inverts compare the work of M. Hirschfeld in the\nJahrbuch f\u00fcr sexuelle Zwischenstufen, 1904. Cf. also Brill, The\nConception of Homosexuality, Journal of the A.M.A., August 2, 1913.\n[4] Such a striving against the compulsion to inversion favors cures by\nsuggestion of psychoanalysis.\n[5] Many have justly emphasized the fact that the autobiographic\nstatements of inverts, as to the time of the appearance of their\ntendency to inversion, are untrustworthy as they may have repressed from\nmemory any evidences of heterosexual feelings.\nPsychoanalysis has confirmed this suspicion in all cases of inversion\naccessible, and has decidedly changed their anamnesis by filling up the\ninfantile amnesias.\n[6] With what reserve the diagnosis of degeneration should be made and\nwhat slight practical significance can be attributed to it can be\ngathered from the discussions of Moebius (Ueber Entartung; Grenzfragen\ndes Nerven- und Seelenlebens, No. III, 1900). He says: \"If we review the\nwide sphere of degeneration upon which we have here turned some light we\ncan conclude without further ado that it is really of little value to\ndiagnose degeneration.\"\n[7] We must agree with the spokesman of \"Uranism\" that some of the most\nprominent men known have been inverts and perhaps absolute inverts.\n[8] In the conception of inversion the pathological features have been\nSeparated from the anthropological. For this credit is due to I. Bloch\n(Beitr\u00e4ge zur \u00c4tiologie der Psychopathia Sexualis, 2 Teile, 1902-3), who\nhas also brought into prominence the existence of inversion in the old\ncivilized nations.\n[9] Compare the last detailed discussion of somatic hermaphroditism\n(Taruffi, Hermaphroditismus und Zeugungsunf\u00e4higkeit, German edit. by R.\nTeuscher, 1903), and the works of Neugebauer in many volumes of the\nJahrbuch f\u00fcr sexuelle Zwischenstufen.\n[10] J. Halban, \"Die Entstehung der Geschlechtscharaktere,\" Arch. f\u00fcr\nGyn\u00e4kologie, Bd. 70, 1903. See also there the literature on the subject.\n[11] According to a report in Vol. 6 of the Jahrbuch f. sexuelle\nZwischenstufen, E. Gley is supposed to have been the first to mention\nbisexuality as an explanation of inversion. He published a paper (Les\nAb\u00e9rrations de l'instinct Sexuel) in the Revue Philosophique as early as\nJanuary, 1884. It is moreover noteworthy that the majority of authors\nwho trace the inversion to bisexuality assume this factor not only for\nthe inverts but also for those who have developed normally, and justly\ninterpret the inversion as a result of a disturbance in development.\nAmong these authors are Chevalier (Inversion Sexuelle, 1893), and v.\nKrafft-Ebing (\"Zur Erkl\u00e4rung der kontr\u00e4ren Sexualempfindung,\" Jahrb\u00fccher\nf. Psychiatrie u. Nervenheilkunde, XIII), who states that there are a\nnumber of observations \"from which at least the virtual and continued\nexistence of this second center (of the underlying sex) results.\" A Dr.\nArduin (Die Frauenfrage und die sexuellen Zwischenstufen, 2d vol. of the\nJahrbuch f. sexuelle Zwischenstufen, 1900) states that \"in every man\nthere exist male and female elements.\" See also the same Jahrbuch, Bd.\nI, 1899 (\"Die objektive Diagnose der Homosexualitat,\" by M. Hirschfeld,\npp. 8-9). In the determination of sex, as far as heterosexual persons\nare concerned, some are disproportionately more strongly developed than\nothers. G. Herman is firm in his belief \"that in every woman there are\nmale, and in every man there are female germs and qualities\" (Genesis,\ndas Gesetz der Zeugung, 9 Bd., Libido und Manie, 1903). As recently as\n1906 W. Fliess (Der Ablauf des Lebens) has claimed ownership of the idea\nof bisexuality (in the sense of double sex). Psychoanalytic\ninvestigation very strongly opposes the attempt to separate homosexuals\nfrom other persons as a group of a special nature. By also studying\nsexual excitations other than the manifestly open ones it discovers that\nall men are capable of homosexual object selection and actually\naccomplish this in the unconscious. Indeed the attachments of libidinous\nfeelings to persons of the same sex play no small r\u00f4le as factors in\nnormal psychic life, and as causative factors of disease they play a\ngreater r\u00f4le than those belonging to the opposite sex. According to\npsychoanalysis, it rather seems that it is the independence of the\nobject, selection of the sex of the object, the same free disposal over\nmale and female objects, as observed in childhood, in primitive states\nand in prehistoric times, which forms the origin from which the normal\nas well as the inversion types developed, following restrictions in this\nor that direction. In the psychoanalytic sense the exclusive sexual\ninterest of the man for the woman is also a problem requiring an\nexplanation, and is not something that is self-evident and explainable\non the basis of chemical attraction. The determination as to the\ndefinite sexual behavior does not occur until after puberty and is the\nresult of a series of as yet not observable factors, some of which are\nof a constitutional, while some are of an accidental nature. Certainly\nsome of these factors can turn out to be so enormous that by their\ncharacter they influence the result. In general, however, the\nmultiplicity of the determining factors is reflected by the manifoldness\nof the outcomes in the manifest sexual behavior of the person. In the\ninversion types it can be ascertained that they are altogether\ncontrolled by an archaic constitution and by primitive psychic\nmechanisms. The importance of the _narcissistic object selection_ and\nthe _clinging_ to the erotic significance of the _anal_ zone seem to be\ntheir most essential characteristics. But one gains nothing by\nseparating the most extreme inversion types from the others on the basis\nof such constitutional peculiarities. What is found in the latter as\nseemingly an adequate determinant can also be demonstrated only in\nlesser force in the constitution of transitional types and in manifestly\nnormal persons. The differences in the results may be of a qualitative\nnature, but analysis shows that the differences in the determinants are\nonly quantitative. As a remarkable factor among the accidental\ninfluences of the object selection, we found the sexual rejection or the\nearly sexual intimidation, and our attention was also called to the fact\nthat the existence of both parents plays an important r\u00f4le in the\nchild's life. The disappearance of a strong father in childhood not\ninfrequently favors the inversion. Finally, one might demand that the\ninversion of the sexual object should notionally be strictly separated\nfrom the mixing of the sex characteristics in the subject. A certain\namount of independence is unmistakable also in this relation.\n[12] Although psychoanalysis has not yet given us a full explanation for\nthe origin of inversion, it has revealed the psychic mechanism of its\ngenesis and has essentially enriched the problems in question. In all\nthe cases examined we have ascertained that the later inverts go through\nin their childhood a phase of very intense but short-lived fixation on\nthe woman (usually on the mother) and after overcoming it they identify\nthemselves with the woman and take themselves as the sexual object; that\nis, proceeding on a narcissistic basis, they look for young men\nresembling themselves in persons whom they wish to love as their mother\nhas loved them. We have, moreover, frequently found that alleged inverts\nare by no means indifferent to the charms of women, but the excitation\nevoked by the woman is always transferred to a male object. They thus\nrepeat through life the mechanism which gave origin to their inversion.\nTheir obsessive striving for the man proves to be determined by their\nrestless flight from the woman.\n[13] The most pronounced difference between the sexual life\n(Liebesleben) of antiquity and ours lies in the fact that the ancients\nplaced the emphasis on the impulse itself, while we put it on its\nobject. The ancients extolled the impulse and were ready to ennoble\nthrough it even an inferior object, while we disparage the activity of\nthe impulse as such and only countenance it on account of the merits of\nthe object.\n[14] I must mention here that the blind obedience evinced by the\nhypnotized subject to the hypnotist causes me to think that the nature\nof hypnosis is to be found in the unconscious fixation of the libido on\nthe person of the hypnotizer (by means of the masochistic component of\nthe sexual impulse).\nFerenczi connects this character of suggestibility with the \"parent\ncomplex\" (Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Psychoanalytische und psychopathologische\nForschungen, I, 1909).\n[15] Moreover, it is to be noted that sexual overvaluation does not\nbecome pronounced in all mechanisms of object selection, and that we\nshall later learn to know another and more direct explanation for the\nsexual r\u00f4le of the other parts of the body.\n[16] Further investigations lead to the conclusion that I. Bloch has\noverestimated the factor of excitement-hunger (Reizhunger). The various\nroads upon which the libido moves behave to each other from the very\nbeginning like communicating pipes; the factor of collateral streaming\nmust also be considered.\n[17] This weakness corresponds to the constitutional predisposition. The\nearly sexual intimidation which pushes the person away from the normal\nsexual aim and urges him to seek a substitute, has been demonstrated by\npsychoanalysis, as an accidental determinant.\n[18] The shoe or slipper is accordingly a symbol for the female\ngenitals.\n[19] Psychoanalysis has filled up the gap in the understanding of\nfetichisms by showing that the selection of the fetich depends on a\ncoprophilic smell-desire which has been lost by repression. Feet and\nhair are strong smelling objects which are raised to fetiches after the\nrenouncing of the now unpleasant sensation of smell. Accordingly, only\nthe filthy and ill-smelling foot is the sexual object in the perversion\nwhich corresponds to the foot fetichism. Another contribution to the\nexplanation of the fetichistic preference of the foot is found in the\nInfantile Sexual Theories (see later). The foot replaces the penis which\nis so much missed in the woman. In some cases of foot fetichism it could\nbe shown that the desire for looking originally directed to the\ngenitals, which wished to reach its object from below, was stopped on\nthe way by prohibition and repression, and therefore adhered to the foot\nor shoe as a fetich. In conformity with infantile expectation, the\nfemale genital was hereby imagined as a male genital.\n[20] I have no doubt that the conception of the \"beautiful\" is rooted in\nthe soil of sexual excitement and originally signified the sexual\nexcitant. The more remarkable, therefore, is the fact that the genitals,\nthe sight of which provokes the greatest sexual excitement, can really\nnever be considered \"beautiful.\"\n[21] Cf. here the later communication on the pregenital phases of the\nsexual development, in which this view is confirmed. See below,\n\"Ambivalence.\"\n[22] Instead of substantiating this statement by many examples I will\nmerely cite Havelock Ellis (The Sexual Impulse, 1903): \"All known cases\nof sadism and masochism, even those cited by v. Krafft-Ebing, always\nshow (as has already been shown by Colin, Scott, and F\u00e9r\u00e9) traces of\nboth groups of manifestations in the same individual.\"\n[23] On the other hand the restricting forces of the sexual\nevolution--disgust, shame, morality--must also be looked upon as\nhistoric precipitates of the outer inhibitions which the sexual impulse\nexperienced in the psychogenesis of humanity. One can observe that they\nappear in their time during the development of the individual almost\nspontaneously at the call of education and influence.\n[24] Studien \u00fcber Hysterie, 1895, J. Breuer tells of the patient on whom\nhe first practiced the cathartic method: \"The sexual factor was\nsurprisingly undeveloped.\"\n[25] The well-known fancies of perverts which under favorable conditions\nare changed into contrivances, the delusional fears of paranoiacs which\nare in a hostile manner projected on others, and the unconscious fancies\nof hysterics which are discovered in their symptoms by psychoanalysis,\nagree as to content in the minutest details.\n[26] A psychoneurosis very often associates itself with a manifest\ninversion in which the heterosexual feeling becomes subjected to\ncomplete repression.--It is but just to state that the necessity of a\ngeneral recognition of the tendency to inversion in psychoneurotics was\nfirst imparted to me personally by Wilh. Fliess, of Berlin, after I had\nmyself discovered it in some cases.\n[27] It is not easy to justify here this assumption which was taken from\na definite class of neurotic diseases. On the other hand, it would be\nimpossible to assert anything definite concerning the impulses if one\ndid not take the trouble of mentioning these presuppositions.\n[28] One should here think of Moll's assertion, who divides the sexual\nimpulse into the impulses of contrectation and detumescence.\nContrectation signifies a desire to touch the skin.\nII\nTHE INFANTILE SEXUALITY\nIt is a part of popular belief about the sexual impulse that it is\nabsent in childhood and that it first appears in the period of life\nknown as puberty. This, though a common error, is serious in its\nconsequences and is chiefly due to our present ignorance of the\nfundamental principles of the sexual life. A comprehensive study of the\nsexual manifestations of childhood would probably reveal to us the\nexistence of the essential features of the sexual impulse, and would\nmake us acquainted with its development and its composition from various\nsources.\n*The Neglect of the Infantile.*--It is remarkable that those writers who\nendeavor to explain the qualities and reactions of the adult individual\nhave given so much more attention to the ancestral period than to the\nperiod of the individual's own existence--that is, they have attributed\nmore influence to heredity than to childhood. As a matter of fact, it\nmight well be supposed that the influence of the latter period would be\neasier to understand, and that it would be entitled to more\nconsideration than heredity.[1] To be sure, one occasionally finds in\nmedical literature notes on the premature sexual activities of small\nchildren, about erections and masturbation and even actions resembling\ncoitus, but these are referred to merely as exceptional occurrences, as\ncuriosities, or as deterring examples of premature perversity. No author\nhas to my knowledge recognized the normality of the sexual impulse in\nchildhood, and in the numerous writings on the development of the child\nthe chapter on \"Sexual Development\" is usually passed over.[2]\n*Infantile Amnesia.*--This remarkable negligence is due partly to\nconventional considerations, which influence the writers on account of\ntheir own bringing up, and partly to a psychic phenomenon which has thus\nfar remained unexplained. I refer to the peculiar amnesia which veils\nfrom most people (not from all!) the first years of their childhood,\nusually the first six or eight years. So far it has not occurred to us\nthat this amnesia ought to surprise us, though we have good reasons for\nsurprise. For we are informed that in those years from which we later\nobtain nothing except a few incomprehensible memory fragments, we have\nvividly reacted to impressions, that we have manifested pain and\npleasure like any human being, that we have evinced love, jealousy, and\nother passions as they then affected us; indeed we are told that we have\nuttered remarks which proved to grown-ups that we possessed\nunderstanding and a budding power of judgment. Still we know nothing of\nall this when we become older. Why does our memory lag behind all our\nother psychic activities? We really have reason to believe that at no\ntime of life are we more capable of impressions and reproductions than\nduring the years of childhood.[3]\nOn the other hand we must assume, or we may convince ourselves through\npsychological observations on others, that the very impressions which we\nhave forgotten have nevertheless left the deepest traces in our psychic\nlife, and acted as determinants for our whole future development. We\nconclude therefore that we do not deal with a real forgetting of\ninfantile impressions but rather with an amnesia similar to that\nobserved in neurotics for later experiences, the nature of which\nconsists in their being detained from consciousness (repression). But\nwhat forces bring about this repression of the infantile impressions? He\nwho can solve this riddle will also explain hysterical amnesia.\nWe shall not, however, hesitate to assert that the existence of the\ninfantile amnesia gives us a new point of comparison between the psychic\nstates of the child and those of the psychoneurotic. We have already\nencountered another point of comparison when confronted by the fact that\nthe sexuality of the psychoneurotic preserves the infantile character or\nhas returned to it. May there not be an ultimate connection between the\ninfantile and the hysterical amnesias?\nThe connection between the infantile and the hysterical amnesias is\nreally more than a mere play of wit. The hysterical amnesia which serves\nthe repression can only be explained by the fact that the individual\nalready possesses a sum of recollections which have been withdrawn from\nconscious disposal and which by associative connection now seize that\nwhich is acted upon by the repelling forces of the repression emanating\nfrom consciousness.[4] We may say that without infantile amnesia there\nwould be no hysterical amnesia.\nI believe that the infantile amnesia which causes the individual to look\nupon his childhood as if it were a _prehistoric_ time and conceals from\nhim the beginning of his own sexual life--that this amnesia is\nresponsible for the fact that one does not usually attribute any value\nto the infantile period in the development of the sexual life. One\nsingle observer cannot fill the gap which has been thus produced in our\nknowledge. As early as 1896 I had already emphasized the significance of\nchildhood for the origin of certain important phenomena connected with\nthe sexual life, and since then I have not ceased to put into the\nforeground the importance of the infantile factor for sexuality.\nTHE SEXUAL LATENCY PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD AND ITS INTERRUPTIONS\nThe extraordinary frequent discoveries of apparently abnormal and\nexceptional sexual manifestations in childhood, as well as the\ndiscovery of infantile reminiscences in neurotics, which were hitherto\nunconscious, allow us to sketch the following picture of the sexual\nbehavior of childhood.[5]\nIt seems certain that the newborn child brings with it the germs of\nsexual feelings which continue to develop for some time and then succumb\nto a progressive suppression, which is in turn broken through by the\nproper advances of the sexual development and which can be checked by\nindividual idiosyncrasies. Nothing is known concerning the laws and\nperiodicity of this oscillating course of development. It seems,\nhowever, that the sexual life of the child mostly manifests itself in\nthe third or fourth year in some form accessible to observation.[6]\n*The Sexual Inhibition.*--It is during this period of total or at least\npartial latency that the psychic forces develop which later act as\ninhibitions on the sexual life, and narrow its direction like dams.\nThese psychic forces are loathing, shame, and moral and esthetic ideal\ndemands. We may gain the impression that the erection of these dams in\nthe civilized child is the work of education; and surely education\ncontributes much to it. In reality, however, this development is\norganically determined and can occasionally be produced without the help\nof education. Indeed education remains properly within its assigned\nrealm only if it strictly follows the path of the organic determinant\nand impresses it somewhat cleaner and deeper.\n*Reaction Formation and Sublimation.*--What are the means that\naccomplish these very important constructions so significant for the\nlater personal culture and normality? They are probably brought about at\nthe cost of the infantile sexuality itself, the influx of which has not\nstopped even in this latency period--the energy of which indeed has been\nturned away either wholly or partially from sexual utilization and\nconducted to other aims. The historians of civilization seem to be\nunanimous in the opinion that such deviation of sexual motive powers\nfrom sexual aims to new aims, a process which merits the name of\n_sublimation_, has furnished powerful components for all cultural\naccomplishments. We will therefore add that the same process acts in the\ndevelopment of every individual, and that it begins to act in the sexual\nlatency period.[7]\nWe can also venture an opinion about the mechanisms of such sublimation.\nThe sexual feelings of these infantile years on the one hand could not\nbe utilizable, since the procreating functions are postponed,--this is\nthe chief character of the latency period; on the other hand, they would\nin themselves be perverse, as they would emanate from erogenous zones\nand would be born of impulses which in the individual's course of\ndevelopment could only evoke a feeling of displeasure. They therefore\nawaken contrary forces (feelings of reaction), which in order to\nsuppress such displeasure, build up the above mentioned psychic dams:\nloathing, shame, and morality.[8]\n*The Interruptions of the Latency Period.*--Without deluding ourselves\nas to the hypothetical nature and deficient clearness of our\nunderstanding regarding the infantile period of latency and delay, we\nwill return to reality and state that such a utilization of the\ninfantile sexuality represents an ideal bringing up from which the\ndevelopment of the individual usually deviates in some measure and often\nvery considerably. A portion of the sexual manifestation which has\nwithdrawn from sublimation occasionally breaks through, or a sexual\nactivity remains throughout the whole duration of the latency period\nuntil the reinforced breaking through of the sexual impulse in puberty.\nIn so far as they have paid any attention to infantile sexuality the\neducators behave as if they shared our views concerning the formation of\nthe moral forces of defence at the cost of sexuality, and as if they\nknew that sexual activity makes the child uneducable; for the educators\nconsider all sexual manifestations of the child as an \"evil\" in the face\nof which little can be accomplished. We have, however, every reason for\ndirecting our attention to those phenomena so much feared by the\neducators, for we expect to find in them the solution of the primitive\nformation of the sexual impulse.\nTHE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE INFANTILE SEXUALITY\nFor reasons which we shall discuss later we will take as a model of the\ninfantile sexual manifestations thumbsucking (pleasure-sucking), to\nwhich the Hungarian pediatrist, Lindner, has devoted an excellent\nessay.[9]\n*Thumbsucking.*--Thumbsucking, which manifests itself in the nursing\nbaby and which may be continued till maturity or throughout life,\nconsists in a rhythmic repetition of sucking contact with the mouth (the\nlips), wherein the purpose of taking nourishment is excluded. A part of\nthe lip itself, the tongue, which is another preferable skin region\nwithin reach, and even the big toe--may be taken as objects for sucking.\nSimultaneously, there is also a desire to grasp things, which manifests\nitself in a rhythmical pulling of the ear lobe and which may cause the\nchild to grasp a part of another person (generally the ear) for the same\npurpose. The pleasure-sucking is connected with an entire exhaustion of\nattention and leads to sleep or even to a motor reaction in the form of\nan orgasm.[10] Pleasure-sucking is often combined with a rubbing contact\nwith certain sensitive parts of the body, such as the breast and\nexternal genitals. It is by this road that many children go from\nthumb-sucking to masturbation.\nLindner himself has recognized the sexual nature of this action and\nopenly emphasized it. In the nursery thumbsucking is often treated in\nthe same way as any other sexual \"naughtiness\" of the child. A very\nstrong objection was raised against this view by many pediatrists and\nneurologists which in part is certainly due to the confusion of the\nterms \"sexual\" and \"genital.\" This contradiction raises the difficult\nquestion, which cannot be rejected, namely, in what general traits do we\nwish to recognize the sexual manifestations of the child. I believe that\nthe association of the manifestations into which we gained an insight\nthrough psychoanalytic investigation justify us in claiming thumbsucking\nas a sexual activity and in studying through it the essential features\nof the infantile sexual activity.\n*Autoerotism.*--It is our duty here to arrange this state of affairs\ndifferently. Let us insist that the most striking character of this\nsexual activity is that the impulse is not directed against other\npersons but that it gratifies itself on its own body; to use the happy\nterm invented by Havelock Ellis, we will say that it is autoerotic.[11]\nIt is, moreover, clear that the action of the thumbsucking child is\ndetermined by the fact that it seeks a pleasure which has already been\nexperienced and is now remembered. Through the rhythmic sucking on a\nportion of the skin or mucous membrane it finds the gratification in the\nsimplest way. It is also easy to conjecture on what occasions the child\nfirst experienced this pleasure which it now strives to renew. The first\nand most important activity in the child's life, the sucking from the\nmother's breast (or its substitute), must have acquainted it with this\npleasure. We would say that the child's lips behaved like an _erogenous\nzone_, and that the excitement through the warm stream of milk was\nreally the cause of the pleasurable sensation. To be sure, the\ngratification of the erogenous zone was at first united with the\ngratification of taking nourishment. He who sees a satiated child sink\nback from the mother's breast, and fall asleep with reddened cheeks and\nblissful smile, will have to admit that this picture remains as typical\nof the expression of sexual gratification in later life. But the desire\nfor repetition of the sexual gratification is separated from the desire\nfor taking nourishment; a separation which becomes unavoidable with the\nappearance of the teeth when the nourishment is no longer sucked in but\nchewed. The child does not make use of a strange object for sucking but\nprefers its own skin because it is more convenient, because it thus\nmakes itself independent of the outer world which it cannot yet control,\nand because in this way it creates for itself, as it were, a second,\neven if an inferior, erogenous zone. The inferiority of this second\nregion urges it later to seek the same parts, the lips of another\nperson. (\"It is a pity that I cannot kiss myself,\" might be attributed\nto it.)\nNot all children suck their thumbs. It may be assumed that it is found\nonly in children in whom the erogenous significance of the lip-zone is\nconstitutionally re\u00ebnforced. Children in whom this is retained are\nhabitual kissers as adults and show a tendency to perverse kissing, or\nas men they have a marked desire for drinking and smoking. But if\nrepression comes into play they experience disgust for eating and evince\nhysterical vomiting. By virtue of the community of the lip-zone the\nrepression encroaches upon the impulse of nourishment. Many of my female\npatients showing disturbances in eating, such as hysterical globus,\nchoking sensations, and vomiting, have been energetic thumbsuckers\nduring infancy.\nIn the thumbsucking or pleasure-sucking we have already been able to\nobserve the three essential characters of an infantile sexual\nmanifestation. The latter has its origin in conjunction with a bodily\nfunction which is very important for life, it does not yet know any\nsexual object, it is _autoerotic_ and its sexual aim is under the\ncontrol of an _erogenous zone_. Let us assume for the present that these\ncharacters also hold true for most of the other activities of the\ninfantile sexual impulse.\nTHE SEXUAL AIM OF THE INFANTILE SEXUALITY\n*The Characters of the Erogenous Zones.*--From the example of\nthumbsucking we may gather a great many points useful for the\ndistinguishing of an erogenous zone. It is a portion of skin or mucous\nmembrane in which the stimuli produce a feeling of pleasure of definite\nquality. There is no doubt that the pleasure-producing stimuli are\ngoverned by special determinants which we do not know. The rhythmic\ncharacters must play some part in them and this strongly suggests an\nanalogy to tickling. It does not, however, appear so certain whether the\ncharacter of the pleasurable feeling evoked by the stimulus can be\ndesignated as \"peculiar,\" and in what part of this peculiarity the\nsexual factor exists. Psychology is still groping in the dark when it\nconcerns matters of pleasure and pain, and the most cautious assumption\nis therefore the most advisable. We may perhaps later come upon reasons\nwhich seem to support the peculiar quality of the sensation of pleasure.\nThe erogenous quality may adhere most notably to definite regions of the\nbody. As is shown by the example of thumbsucking, there are predestined\nerogenous zones. But the same example also shows that any other region\nof skin or mucous membrane may assume the function of an erogenous zone;\nit must therefore carry along a certain adaptability. The production of\nthe sensation of pleasure therefore depends more on the quality of the\nstimulus than on the nature of the bodily region. The thumbsucking child\nlooks around on his body and selects any portion of it for\npleasure-sucking, and becoming accustomed to it, he then prefers it. If\nhe accidentally strikes upon a predestined region, such as breast,\nnipple or genitals, it naturally has the preference. A quite analogous\ntendency to displacement is again found in the symptomatology of\nhysteria. In this neurosis the repression mostly concerns the genital\nzones proper; these in turn transmit their excitation to the other\nerogenous zones, usually dormant in mature life, which then behave\nexactly like genitals. But besides this, just as in thumbsucking, any\nother region of the body may become endowed with the excitation of the\ngenitals and raised to an erogenous zone. Erogenous and hysterogenous\nzones show the same characters.[12]\n*The Infantile Sexual Aim.*--The sexual aim of the infantile impulse\nconsists in the production of gratification through the proper\nexcitation of this or that selected erogenous zone. In order to leave a\ndesire for its repetition this gratification must have been previously\nexperienced, and we may be sure that nature has devised definite means\nso as not to leave this occurrence to mere chance. The arrangement which\nhas fulfilled this purpose for the lip-zone we have already discussed;\nit is the simultaneous connection of this part of the body with the\ntaking of nourishment. We shall also meet other similar mechanisms as\nsources of sexuality. The state of desire for repetition of\ngratification can be recognized through a peculiar feeling of tension\nwhich in itself is rather of a painful character, and through a\ncentrally-determined feeling of itching or sensitiveness which is\nprojected into the peripheral erogenous zone. The sexual aim may\ntherefore be formulated as follows: the chief object is to substitute\nfor the projected feeling of sensitiveness in the erogenous zone that\nouter stimulus which removes the feeling of sensitiveness by evoking the\nfeeling of gratification. This external stimulus consists usually in a\nmanipulation which is analogous to sucking.\nIt is in full accord with our physiological knowledge if the desire\nhappens to be awakened also peripherally through an actual change in the\nerogenous zone. The action is puzzling only to some extent as one\nstimulus for its suppression seems to want another applied to the same\nplace.\nTHE MASTURBATIC SEXUAL MANIFESTATIONS[13]\nIt is a matter of great satisfaction to know that there is nothing\nfurther of greater importance to learn about the sexual activity of the\nchild after the impulse of one erogenous zone has become comprehensible\nto us. The most pronounced differences are found in the action necessary\nfor the gratification, which consists in sucking for the lip zone and\nwhich must be replaced by other muscular actions according to the\nsituation and nature of the other zones.\n*The Activity of the Anal Zone.*--Like the lip zone the anal zone is,\nthrough its position, adapted to conduct the sexuality to the other\nfunctions of the body. It should be assumed that the erogenous\nsignificance of this region of the body was originally very large.\nThrough psychoanalysis one finds, not without surprise, the many\ntransformations that are normally undertaken with the usual excitations\nemanating from here, and that this zone often retains for life a\nconsiderable fragment of genital irritability.[14] The intestinal\ncatarrhs so frequent during infancy produce intensive irritations in\nthis zone, and we often hear it said that intestinal catarrh at this\ndelicate age causes \"nervousness.\" In later neurotic diseases they exert\na definite influence on the symptomatic expression of the neurosis,\nplacing at its disposal the whole sum of intestinal disturbances.\nConsidering the erogenous significance of the anal zone which has been\nretained at least in transformation, one should not laugh at the\nhemorrhoidal influences to which the old medical literature attached so\nmuch weight in the explanation of neurotic states.\nChildren utilizing the erogenous sensitiveness of the anal zone can be\nrecognized by their holding back of fecal masses until through\naccumulation there result violent muscular contractions; the passage of\nthese masses through the anus is apt to produce a marked irritation of\nthe mucus membrane. Besides the pain this must produce also a sensation\nof pleasure. One of the surest premonitions of later eccentricity or\nnervousness is when an infant obstinately refuses to empty his bowel\nwhen placed on the chamber by the nurse and reserves this function at\nits own pleasure. It does not concern him that he will soil his bed; all\nhe cares for is not to lose the subsidiary pleasure while defecating.\nThe educators have again the right inkling when they designate children\nwho withhold these functions as bad. The content of the bowel which is\nan exciting object to the sexually sensitive surface of mucous membrane\nbehaves like the precursor of another organ which does not become active\nuntil after the phase of childhood. In addition it has other important\nmeanings to the nursling. It is evidently treated as an additional part\nof the body, it represents the first \"donation,\" the disposal of which\nexpresses the pliability while the retention of it can express the\nspite of the little being towards its environment. From the idea of\n\"donation\" he later gains the meaning of the \"babe\" which according to\none of the infantile sexual theories is acquired through eating and is\nborn through the bowel.\nThe retention of fecal masses, which is at first intentional in order to\nutilize them, as it were, for masturbatic excitation of the anal zone,\nis at least one of the roots of constipation so frequent in neuropaths.\nThe whole significance of the anal zone is mirrored in the fact that\nthere are but few neurotics who have not their special scatologic\ncustoms, ceremonies, etc., which they retain with cautious secrecy.\nReal masturbatic irritation of the anal zone by means of the fingers,\nevoked through either centrally or peripherally supported itching, is\nnot at all rare in older children.\n*The Activity of the Genital Zone.*--Among the erogenous zones of the\nchild's body there is one which certainly does not play the main r\u00f4le,\nand which cannot be the carrier of earliest sexual feeling--which,\nhowever, is destined for great things in later life. In both male and\nfemale it is connected with the voiding of urine (penis, clitoris), and\nin the former it is enclosed in a sack of mucous membrane, probably in\norder not to miss the irritations caused by the secretions which may\narouse the sexual excitement at an early age. The sexual activities of\nthis erogenous zone, which belongs to the real genitals, are the\nbeginning of the later normal sexual life.\nOwing to the anatomical position, the overflowing of secretions, the\nwashing and rubbing of the body, and to certain accidental excitements\n(the wandering of intestinal worms in the girl), it happens that the\npleasurable feeling which these parts of the body are capable of\nproducing makes itself noticeable to the child even during the sucking\nage, and thus awakens desire for its repetition. When we review all the\nactual arrangements, and bear in mind that the measures for cleanliness\nhave the same effect as the uncleanliness itself, we can then scarcely\nmistake nature's intention, which is to establish the future primacy of\nthese erogenous zones for the sexual activity through the infantile\nonanism from which hardly an individual escapes. The action of removing\nthe stimulus and setting free the gratification consists in a rubbing\ncontiguity with the hand or in a certain previously-formed pressure\nreflex effected by the closure of the thighs. The latter procedure seems\nto be the more primitive and is by far the more common in girls. The\npreference for the hand in boys already indicates what an important part\nof the male sexual activity will be accomplished in the future by the\nimpulse to mastery (Bem\u00e4chtigungstrieb).[15] It can only help towards\nclearness if I state that the infantile masturbation should be divided\ninto three phases. The first phase belongs to the nursing period, the\nsecond to the short flourishing period of sexual activity at about the\nfourth year, only the third corresponds to the one which is often\nconsidered exclusively as onanism of puberty.\nThe infantile onanism seems to disappear after a brief time, but it may\ncontinue uninterruptedly till puberty and thus represent the first\nmarked deviation from the development desirable for civilized man. At\nsome time during childhood after the nursing period, the sexual impulse\nof the genitals reawakens and continues active for some time until it is\nagain suppressed, or it may continue without interruption. The possible\nrelations are very diverse and can only be elucidated through a more\nprecise analysis of individual cases. The details, however, of this\n_second_ infantile sexual activity leave behind the profoundest\n(unconscious) impressions in the persons's memory; if the individual\nremains healthy they determine his character and if he becomes sick\nafter puberty they determine the symptomatology of his neurosis.[16] In\nthe latter case it is found that this sexual period is forgotten and the\nconscious reminiscences pointing to them are displaced; I have already\nmentioned that I would like to connect the normal infantile amnesia with\nthis infantile sexual activity. By psychoanalytic investigation it is\npossible to bring to consciousness the forgotten material, and thereby\nto remove a compulsion which emanates from the unconscious psychic\nmaterial.\n*The Return of the Infantile Masturbation.*--The sexual excitation of\nthe nursing period returns during the designated years of childhood as a\ncentrally determined tickling sensation demanding onanistic\ngratification, or as a pollution-like process which, analogous to the\npollution of maturity, may attain gratification without the aid of any\naction. The latter case is more frequent in girls and in the second half\nof childhood; its determinants are not well understood, but it often,\nthough not regularly, seems to have as a basis a period of early active\nonanism. The symptomatology of this sexual manifestation is poor; the\ngenital apparatus is still undeveloped and all signs are therefore\ndisplayed by the urinary apparatus which is, so to say, the guardian of\nthe genital apparatus. Most of the so-called bladder disturbances of\nthis period are of a sexual nature; whenever the enuresis nocturna does\nnot represent an epileptic attack it corresponds to a pollution.\nThe return of the sexual activity is determined by inner and outer\ncauses which can be conjectured from the formation of the symptoms of\nneurotic diseases and definitely revealed by psychoanalytic\ninvestigations. The internal causes will be discussed later, the\naccidental outer causes attain at this time a great and permanent\nsignificance. As the first outer cause we have the influence of\nseduction which prematurely treats the child as a sexual object; under\nconditions favoring impressions this teaches the child the gratification\nof the genital zones, and thus usually forces it to repeat this\ngratification in onanism. Such influences can come from adults or other\nchildren. I cannot admit that I overestimated its frequency or its\nsignificance in my contributions to the etiology of hysteria,[17] though\nI did not know then that normal individuals may have the same\nexperiences in their childhood, and hence placed a higher value on\nseductions than on the factors found in the sexual constitution and\ndevelopment.[18] It is quite obvious that no seduction is necessary to\nawaken the sexual life of the child, that such an awakening may come on\nspontaneously from inner sources.\n*Polymorphous-perverse Disposition.*--It is instructive to know that\nunder the influence of seduction the child may become\npolymorphous-perverse and may be misled into all sorts of\ntransgressions. This goes to show that it carries along the adaptation\nfor them in its disposition. The formation of such perversions meets but\nslight resistance because the psychic dams against sexual\ntransgressions, such as shame, loathing and morality--which depend on\nthe age of the child--are not yet erected or are only in the process of\nformation. In this respect the child perhaps does not behave differently\nfrom the average uncultured woman in whom the same polymorphous-perverse\ndisposition exists. Such a woman may remain sexually normal under usual\nconditions, but under the guidance of a clever seducer she will find\npleasure in every perversion and will retain the same as her sexual\nactivity. The same polymorphous or infantile disposition fits the\nprostitute for her professional activity, and in the enormous number of\nprostitutes and of women to whom we must attribute an adaptation for\nprostitution, even if they do not follow this calling, it is absolutely\nimpossible not to recognize in their uniform disposition for all\nperversions the universal and primitive human.\n*Partial Impulses.*--For the rest, the influence of seduction does not\naid us in unravelling the original relations of the sexual impulse, but\nrather confuses our understanding of the same, inasmuch as it\nprematurely supplies the child with the sexual object at a time when the\ninfantile sexual impulse does not yet evince any desire for it. We must\nadmit, however, that the infantile sexual life, though mainly under the\ncontrol of erogenous zones, also shows components in which from the very\nbeginning other persons are regarded as sexual objects. Among these we\nhave the impulses for looking and showing off, and for cruelty, which\nmanifest themselves somewhat independently of the erogenous zones and\nwhich only later enter into intimate relationship with the sexual life;\nbut along with the erogenous sexual activity they are noticeable even in\nthe infantile years as separate and independent strivings. The little\nchild is above all shameless, and during its early years it evinces\ndefinite pleasure in displaying its body and especially its sexual\norgans. A counterpart to this desire which is to be considered as\nperverse, the curiosity to see other persons' genitals, probably appears\nfirst in the later years of childhood when the hindrance of the feeling\nof shame has already reached a certain development. Under the influence\nof seduction the looking perversion may attain great importance for the\nsexual life of the child. Still, from my investigations of the childhood\nyears of normal and neurotic patients, I must conclude that the impulse\nfor looking can appear in the child as a spontaneous sexual\nmanifestation. Small children, whose attention has once been directed to\ntheir own genitals--usually by masturbation--are wont to progress in\nthis direction without outside interference, and to develop a vivid\ninterest in the genitals of their playmates. As the occasion for the\ngratification of such curiosity is generally afforded during the\ngratification of both excrementitious needs, such children become\n_voyeurs_ and are zealous spectators at the voiding of urine and feces\nof others, After this tendency has been repressed, the curiosity to see\nthe genitals of others (one's own or those of the other sex) remains as\na tormenting desire which in some neurotic cases furnishes the strongest\nmotive power for the formation of symptoms.\nThe cruelty component of the sexual impulse develops in the child with\nstill greater independence of those sexual activities which are\nconnected with erogenous zones. Cruelty is especially near the childish\ncharacter, since the inhibition which restrains the impulse to mastery\nbefore it causes pain to others--that is, the capacity for\nsympathy--develops comparatively late. As we know, a thorough\npsychological analysis of this impulse has not as yet been successfully\naccomplished; we may assume that the cruel feelings emanate from the\nimpulse to mastery and appear at a period in the sexual life before the\ngenitals have taken on their later r\u00f4le. It then dominates a phase of\nthe sexual life, which we shall later describe as the pregenital\norganization. Children who are distinguished for evincing especial\ncruelty to animals and playmates may be justly suspected of intensive\nand premature sexual activity in the erogenous zones; and in a\nsimultaneous prematurity of all sexual impulses, the erogenous sexual\nactivity surely seems to be primary. The absence of the barrier of\nsympathy carries with it the danger that the connections between cruelty\nand the erogenous impulses formed in childhood cannot be broken in later\nlife.\nAn erogenous source of the passive impulse for cruelty (masochism) is\nfound in the painful irritation of the gluteal region which is familiar\nto all educators since the confessions of J.J. Rousseau. This has justly\ncaused them to demand that physical punishment, which usually concerns\nthis part of the body, should be withheld from all children in whom the\nlibido might be forced into collateral roads by the later demands of\ncultural education.[19]\nTHE INFANTILE SEXUAL INVESTIGATION\n*Inquisitiveness.*--At the same time when the sexual life of the child\nreaches its first bloom, from the age of three to the age of five, it\nalso evinces the beginning of that activity which is ascribed to the\nimpulse for knowledge and investigation. The desire for knowledge can\nneither be added to the elementary components of the impulses nor can it\nbe altogether subordinated under sexuality. Its activity corresponds on\nthe one hand to a sublimating mode of acquisition and on the other hand\nit labors with the energy of the desire for looking. Its relations to\nthe sexual life, however, are of particular importance, for we have\nlearned from psychoanalysis that the inquisitiveness of children is\nattracted to the sexual problems unusually early and in an unexpectedly\nintensive manner, indeed it perhaps may first be awakened by the sexual\nproblems.\n*The Riddle of the Sphinx.*--It is not theoretical but practical\ninterests which start the work of the investigation activity in the\nchild. The threat to the conditions of his existence through the actual\nor expected arrival of a new child, the fear of the loss in care and\nlove which is connected with this event, cause the child to become\nthoughtful and sagacious. Corresponding with the history of this\nawakening, the first problem with which it occupies itself is not the\nquestion as to the difference between the sexes, but the riddle: from\nwhere do children come? In a distorted form, which can easily be\nunraveled, this is the same riddle which was given by the Theban Sphinx.\nThe fact of the two sexes is usually first accepted by the child without\nstruggle and hesitation. It is quite natural for the male child to\npresuppose in all persons it knows a genital like his own, and to find\nit impossible to harmonize the lack of it with his conception of others.\n*The Castration Complex.*--This conviction is energetically adhered to\nby the boy and tenaciously defended against the contradictions which\nsoon result, and are only given up after severe internal struggles\n(castration complex). The substitutive formations of this lost penis of\nthe woman play a great part in the formation of many perversions.\nThe assumption of the same (male) genital in all persons is the first of\nthe remarkable and consequential infantile sexual theories. It is of\nlittle help to the child when biological science agrees with his\npreconceptions and recognizes the feminine clitoris as the real\nsubstitute for the penis. The little girl does not react with similar\nrefusals when she sees the differently formed genital of the boy. She\nis immediately prepared to recognize it, and soon becomes envious of the\npenis; this envy reaches its highest point in the consequentially\nimportant wish that she also should be a boy.\n*Birth Theories.*--Many people can remember distinctly how intensely\nthey interested themselves, in the prepubescent period, in the question\nwhere children came from. The anatomical solutions at that time read\nvery differently; the children come out of the breast or are cut out of\nthe body, or the navel opens itself to let them out. Outside of analysis\none only seldom remembers the investigation corresponding to the early\nchildhood years; it had long merged into repression but its results were\nthoroughly uniform. One gets children by eating something special (as in\nthe fairy tale) and they are born through the bowel like a passage.\nThese infantile theories recall the structures in the animal kingdom,\nespecially do they recall the cloaca of the types which stand lower than\nthe mammals.\n*Sadistic Conception of the Sexual Act.*--If children of so delicate an\nage become spectators of the sexual act between grown-ups, for which an\noccasion is furnished by the conviction of the grown-ups that little\nchildren cannot understand anything sexual, they cannot help conceiving\nthe sexual act as a kind of maltreating or overpowering, that is, it\nimpresses them in a sadistic sense. Psychoanalysis also teaches us that\nsuch an early childhood impression contributes much to the disposition\nfor a later sadistic displacement of the sexual aim. Besides this\nchildren also occupy themselves with the problem of what the sexual act\nconsists in or, as they grasp it, of what marriage consists, and seek\nthe solution of the mystery mostly in an association to which the\nfunctions of urination and defecation give occasion.\n*The Typical Failure of the Infantile Sexual Investigation.*--It can be\nstated in general about the infantile sexual theories that they are\nreproductions of the child's own sexual constitution, and that despite\ntheir grotesque mistakes they evince more understanding of the sexual\nprocesses than is credited to their creators. Children also perceive the\npregnancy of the mother and know how to interpret it correctly; the\nstork fable is very often related before auditors who confront it with a\ndeep, but mostly mute suspicion. But as two elements remain unknown to\nthe infantile sexual investigation, namely, the r\u00f4le of the propagating\nsemen and the female genital opening--precisely the same points in which\nthe infantile organization is still backward--the effort of the\ninfantile investigator regularly remains fruitless, and ends in a\nrenunciation which not infrequently leaves a lasting injury to the\ndesire for knowledge. The sexual investigation of these early childhood\nyears is always conducted alone, it signifies the first step towards\nindependent orientation in the world, and causes a marked estrangement\nbetween the child and the persons of his environment who formerly\nenjoyed its full confidence.\n*The Phases of Development of the Sexual Organization.*--As\ncharacteristics of the infantile sexuality we have hitherto emphasized\nthe fact that it is essentially autoerotic (it finds its object in its\nown body), and that its individual partial impulses, which on the whole\nare unconnected and independent of one another, are striving for the\nacquisition of pleasure. The end of this development forms the so-called\nnormal sexual life of the adult in which the acquisition of pleasure has\nbeen put into the service of the function of propagation, and the\npartial impulses, under the primacy of one single erogenous zone, have\nformed a firm organization for the attainment of the sexual aim in a\nstrange sexual object.\n*Pregenital Organizations.*--The study, with the help of\npsychoanalysis, of the inhibitions and disturbances in this course of\ndevelopment now permits us to recognize additions and primary stages of\nsuch organization of the partial impulses which likewise furnish a sort\nof sexual regime. These phases of the sexual organization normally will\npass over smoothly and will only be recognizable by slight indications.\nOnly in pathological cases do they become active and discernible to\ncoarse observation.\nOrganizations of the sexual life in which the genital zones have not yet\nassumed the dominating r\u00f4le we would call the _pregenital_ phase. So far\nwe have become acquainted with two of them which recall reversions to\nearly animal states.\nOne of the first of such pregenital sexual organizations is the _oral_,\nor if we wish, the cannibalistic. Here the sexual activity is not yet\nseparated from the taking of nourishment, and the contrasts within the\nsame not yet differentiated. The object of the one activity is also that\nof the other, the sexual aim consists in the _incorporating_ into one's\nown body of the object, it is the prototype of that which later plays\nsuch an important psychic r\u00f4le as _identification_. As a remnant of this\nfictitious phase of organization forced on us by pathology we can\nconsider thumbsucking. Here the sexual activity became separated from\nthe nourishment activity and the strange object was given up in favor of\none from his own body.\nA second pregenital phase is the sadistic-anal organization. Here the\ncontrasts which run through the whole sexual life are already developed,\nbut cannot yet be designated as _masculine_ and _feminine_, but must be\ncalled _active_ and _passive_. The activity is supplied by the\nmusculature of the body through the mastery impulse; the erogenous\nmucous membrane of the bowel manifests itself above all as an organ with\na passive sexual aim, for both strivings there are objects present,\nwhich however do not merge together. Besides them there are other\npartial impulses which are active in an autoerotic manner. The sexual\npolarity and the strange object can thus already be demonstrated in this\nphase. The organization and subordination under the function of\npropagation are still lacking.\n*Ambivalence.*--This form of the sexual organization could be retained\nthroughout life and continue to draw to itself a large part of the\nsexual activity. The prevalence of sadism and the r\u00f4le of the cloaca of\nthe anal zone stamps it with an exquisitely archaic impression. As\nanother characteristic belonging to it we can mention the fact that the\ncontrasting pair of impulses are developed in almost the same manner, a\nbehavior which was designated by Bleuler with the happy name of\n_ambivalence_.\nThe assumption of the pregenital organizations of the sexual life is\nbased on the analysis of the neuroses and hardly deserves any\nconsideration without a knowledge of the same. We may expect that\ncontinued analytic efforts will furnish us with still more disclosures\nconcerning the structure and development of the normal sexual function.\nTo complete the picture of the infantile sexual life one must add that\nfrequently or regularly an object selection takes place even in\nchildhood which is as characteristic as the one we have represented for\nthe phase of development of puberty. This object selection proceeds in\nsuch a manner that all the sexual strivings proceed in the direction of\none person in whom they wish to attain their aim. This is then the\nnearest approach to the definitive formation of the sexual life after\npuberty, that is possible in childhood. It differs from the latter only\nin the fact that the collection of the partial impulses and their\nsubordination to the primacy of the genitals is very imperfectly or not\nat all accomplished in childhood. The establishment of this primacy in\nthe service of propagation is therefore the last phase through which the\nsexual organization passes.\n*The Two Periods of Object Selection.*--That the object selection takes\nplace in two periods, or in two shifts, can be spoken of as a typical\noccurrence. The first shift has its origin between the age of three and\nfive years, and is brought to a stop or to retrogression by the latency\nperiod; it is characterized by the infantile nature of its sexual aims.\nThe second shift starts with puberty and determines the definitive\nformation of the sexual life.\nThe fact of the double object selection which is essentially due to the\neffect of the latency period, becomes most significant for the\ndisturbance of this terminal state. The results of the infantile object\nselection reach into the later period; they are either preserved as such\nor are even refreshed at the time of puberty. But due to the development\nof the repression which takes place between the two phases they turn out\nas unutilizable. The sexual aims have become softened and now represent\nwhat we can designate as the _tender_ streams of the sexual life. Only\npsychoanalytic investigation can demonstrate that behind this\ntenderness, such as honoring and esteeming, there is concealed the old\nsexual strivings of the infantile partial impulses which have now become\nuseless. The object selection of the pubescent period must renounce the\ninfantile objects and begin anew as a sensuous stream. The fact that the\ntwo streams do not meet often enough has as a result that one of the\nideals of the sexual life, namely, the union of all desires in one\nobject, can not be attained.\nTHE SOURCES OF THE INFANTILE SEXUALITY\nIn our effort to follow up the origins of the sexual impulse, we have\nthus far found that the sexual excitement originates (_a_) as an imitation\nof a gratification which has been experienced in conjunction with other\norganic processes; (_b_) through the appropriate peripheral stimulation of\nerogenous zones; (_c_) and as an expression of some \"impulse,\" like the\nlooking and cruelty impulses, the origin of which we do not yet fully\nunderstand. The psychoanalytic investigation of later life which leads\nback to childhood and the contemporary observation of the child itself\nco\u00f6perate to reveal to us still other regularly-flowing sources of the\nsexual excitement. The observation of childhood has the disadvantage of\ntreating easily misunderstood material, while psychoanalysis is made\ndifficult by the fact that it can reach its objects and conclusions only\nby great detours; still the united efforts of both methods achieve a\nsufficient degree of positive understanding.\nIn investigating the erogenous zones we have already found that these\nskin regions merely show the special exaggeration of a form of\nsensitiveness which is to a certain degree found over the whole surface\nof the skin. It will therefore not surprise us to learn that certain\nforms of general sensitiveness in the skin can be ascribed to very\ndistinct erogenous action. Among these we will above all mention the\ntemperature sensitiveness; this will perhaps prepare us for the\nunderstanding of the therapeutic effects of warm baths.\n*Mechanical Excitation.*--We must, moreover, describe here the\nproduction of sexual excitation by means of rhythmic mechanical shaking\nof the body. There are three kinds of exciting influences: those acting\non the sensory apparatus of the vestibular nerves, those acting on the\nskin, and those acting on the deep parts, such as the muscles and\njoints. The sexual excitation produced by these influences seems to be\nof a pleasurable nature--it is worth emphasizing that for some time we\nshall continue to use indiscriminately the terms \"sexual excitement\" and\n\"gratification\" leaving the search for an explanation of the terms to a\nlater time--and that the pleasure is produced by mechanical stimulation\nis proved by the fact that children are so fond of play involving\npassive motion, like swinging or flying in the air, and repeatedly\ndemand its repetition.[20] As we know, rocking is regularly used in\nputting restless children to sleep. The shaking sensation experienced in\nwagons and railroad trains exerts such a fascinating influence on older\nchildren, that all boys, at least at one time in their lives, want to\nbecome conductors and drivers. They are wont to ascribe to railroad\nactivities an extraordinary and mysterious interest, and during the age\nof phantastic activity (shortly before puberty) they utilize these as a\nnucleus for exquisite sexual symbolisms. The desire to connect railroad\ntravelling with sexuality apparently originates from the pleasurable\ncharacter of the sensation of motion. When the repression later sets in\nand changes so many of the childish likes into their opposites, these\nsame persons as adolescents and adults then react to the rocking and\nrolling with nausea and become terribly exhausted by a railroad journey,\nor they show a tendency to attacks of anxiety during the journey, and by\nbecoming obsessed with railroad phobia they protect themselves against a\nrepetition of the painful experiences.\nThis also fits in with the not as yet understood fact that the\nconcurrence of fear with mechanical shaking produces the severest\nhysterical forms of traumatic neurosis. It may at least be assumed that\ninasmuch as even a slight intensity of these influences becomes a source\nof sexual excitement, the action of an excessive amount of the same will\nproduce a profound disorder in the sexual mechanism.\n*Muscular Activity.*--It is well known that the child has need for\nstrong muscular activity, from the gratification of which it draws\nextraordinary pleasure. Whether this pleasure has anything to do with\nsexuality, whether it includes in itself sexual satisfaction? or can be\nthe occasion of sexual excitement; all this may be refuted by critical\nconsideration, which will probably be directed also to the position\ntaken above that the pleasure in the sensations of passive movement are\nof sexual character or that they are sexually exciting. The fact\nremains, however, that a number of persons report that they experienced\nthe first signs of excitement in their genitals during fighting or\nwrestling with playmates, in which situation, besides the general\nmuscular exertion, there is an intensive contact with the opponent's\nskin which also becomes effective. The desire for muscular contest with\na definite person, like the desire for word contest in later years, is a\ngood sign that the object selection has been directed toward this\nperson. \"Was sich liebt, das neckt sich.\"[21] In the promotion of sexual\nexcitement through muscular activity we might recognize one of the\nsources of the sadistic impulse. The infantile connection between\nfighting and sexual excitement acts in many persons as a determinant for\nthe future preferred course of their sexual impulse.[22]\n*Affective Processes.*--The other sources of sexual excitement in the\nchild are open to less doubt. Through contemporary observations, as well\nas through later investigations, it is easy to ascertain that all more\nintensive affective processes, even excitements of a terrifying nature,\nencroach upon sexuality; this can at all events furnish us with a\ncontribution to the understanding of the pathogenic action of such\nemotions. In the school child, fear of a coming examination or exertion\nexpended in the solution of a difficult task can become significant for\nthe breaking through of sexual manifestations as well as for his\nrelations to the school, inasmuch as under such excitements a sensation\noften occurs urging him to touch the genitals, or leading to a\npollution-like process with all its disagreeable consequences. The\nbehavior of children at school, which is so often mysterious to the\nteacher, ought surely to be considered in relation with their\ngerminating sexuality. The sexually-exciting influence of some painful\naffects, such as fear, shuddering, and horror, is felt by a great many\npeople throughout life and readily explains why so many seek\nopportunities to experience such sensations, provided that certain\naccessory circumstances (as under imaginary circumstances in reading, or\nin the theater) suppress the earnestness of the painful feeling.\nIf we might assume that the same erogenous action also reaches the\nintensive painful feelings, especially if the pain be toned down or held\nat a distance by a subsidiary determination, this relation would then\ncontain the main roots of the masochistic-sadistic impulse, into the\nmanifold composition of which we are gaining a gradual insight.\n*Intellectual Work.*--Finally, is is evident that mental application or\nthe concentration of attention on an intellectual accomplishment will\nresult, especially often in youthful persons, but in older persons as\nwell, in a simultaneous sexual excitement, which may be looked upon as\nthe only justified basis for the otherwise so doubtful etiology of\nnervous disturbances from mental \"overwork.\"\nIf we now, in conclusion, review the evidences and indications of the\nsources of the infantile sexual excitement, which have been reported\nneither completely nor exhaustively, we may lay down the following\ngeneral laws as suggested or established. It seems to be provided in the\nmost generous manner that the process of sexual excitement--the nature\nof which certainly remains quite mysterious to us--should be set in\nmotion. The factor making this provision in a more or less direct way is\nthe excitation of the sensible surfaces of the skin and sensory organs,\nwhile the most immediate exciting influences are exerted on certain\nparts which are designated as erogenous zones. The criterion in all\nthese sources of sexual excitement is really the quality of the stimuli,\nthough the factor of intensity (in pain) is not entirely unimportant.\nBut in addition to this there are arrangements in the organism which\ninduce sexual excitement as a subsidiary action in a large number of\ninner processes as soon as the intensity of these processes has risen\nabove certain quantitative limits. What we have designated as the\npartial impulses of sexuality are either directly derived from these\ninner sources of sexual excitation or composed of contributions from\nsuch sources and from erogenous zones. It is possible that nothing of\nany considerable significance occurs in the organism that does not\ncontribute its components to the excitement of the sexual impulse.\nIt seems to me at present impossible to shed more light and certainty on\nthese general propositions, and for this I hold two factors responsible;\nfirst, the novelty of this manner of investigation, and secondly, the\nfact that the nature of the sexual excitement is entirely unfamiliar to\nus. Nevertheless, I will not forbear speaking about two points which\npromise to open wide prospects in the future.\n*Diverse Sexual Constitutions.*--(_a_) We have considered above the\npossibility of establishing the manifold character of congenital sexual\nconstitutions through the diverse formation of the erogenous zones; we\nmay now attempt to do the same in dealing with the indirect sources of\nsexual excitement. We may assume that, although these different sources\nfurnish contributions in all individuals, they are not all equally\nstrong in all persons; and that a further contribution to the\ndifferentiation of the diverse sexual constitution will be found in the\npreferred developments of the individual sources of sexual excitement.\n*The Paths of Opposite Influences.*--(_b_) Since we are now dropping the\nfigurative manner of expression hitherto employed, by which we spoke of\n_sources_ of sexual excitement, we may now assume that all the\nconnecting ways leading from other functions to sexuality must also be\npassable in the reverse direction. For example, if the lip zone, the\ncommon possession of both functions, is responsible for the fact that\nthe sexual gratification originates during the taking of nourishment,\nthe same factor offers also an explanation for the disturbances in the\ntaking of nourishment if the erogenous functions of the common zone are\ndisturbed. As soon as we know that concentration of attention may\nproduce sexual excitement, it is quite natural to assume that acting on\nthe same path, but in a contrary direction, the state of sexual\nexcitement will be able to influence the availability of the voluntary\nattention. A good part of the symptomatology of the neuroses which I\ntrace to disturbance of sexual processes manifests itself in\ndisturbances of the other non-sexual bodily functions, and this hitherto\nincomprehensible action becomes less mysterious if it only represents\nthe counterpart of the influences controlling the production of the\nsexual excitement.\nHowever the same paths through which sexual disturbances encroach upon\nthe other functions of the body must in health be supposed to serve\nanother important function. It must be through these paths that the\nattraction of the sexual motive-powers to other than sexual aims, the\nsublimation of sexuality, is accomplished. We must conclude with the\nadmission that very little is definitely known concerning the paths\nbeyond the fact that they exist, and that they are probably passable in\nboth directions.\n[1] For it is really impossible to have a correct knowledge of the part\nbelonging to heredity without first understanding the part belonging to\nthe infantile.\n[2] This assertion on revision seemed even to myself so bold that I\ndecided to test its correctness by again reviewing the literature. The\nresult of this second review did not warrant any change in my original\nstatement. The scientific elaboration of the physical as well as the\npsychic phenomena of the infantile sexuality is still in its initial\nstages. One author (S. Bell, \"A Preliminary Study of the Emotions of\nLove Between the Sexes,\" American Journal of Psychology, XIII, 1902)\nsays: \"I know of no scientist who has given a careful analysis of the\nemotion as it is seen in the adolescent.\" The only attention given to\nsomatic sexual manifestations occurring before the age of puberty was in\nconnection with degenerative manifestations, and these were referred to\nas a sign of degeneration. A chapter on the sexual life of children is\nnot to be found in all the representative psychologies of this age which\nI have read. Among these works I can mention the following: Preyer;\nBaldwin (The Development of the Mind in the Child and in the Race,\n1898); P\u00e9rez (L'enfant de 3-7 ans, 1894); Str\u00fcmpel (Die p\u00e4dagogische\nPathologie, 1899); Karl Groos (Das Seelenleben des Kindes, 1904); Th.\nHeller (Grundriss der Heilp\u00e4dagogic, 1904); Sully (Observations\nConcerning Childhood, 1897). The best impression of the present\nsituation of this sphere can be obtained from the journal Die\nKinderfehler (issued since 1896). On the other hand one gains the\nimpression that the existence of love in childhood is in no need of\ndemonstration. P\u00e9rez (l.c.) speaks for it; K. Groos (Die Spiele der\nMenschen, 1899) states that some children are very early subject to\nsexual emotions, and show a desire to touch the other sex (p. 336); S.\nBell observed the earliest appearance of sex-love in a child during the\nmiddle part of its third year. See also Havelock Ellis, The Sexual\nImpulse, Appendix II.\nThe above-mentioned judgment concerning the literature of infantile\nsexuality no longer holds true since the appearance of the great and\nimportant work of G. Stanley Hall (Adolescence, Its Psychology and its\nRelation to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion,\nand Education, 2 vols., New York, 1908). The recent book of A. Moll, Das\nSexualleben des Kindes, Berlin, 1909, offers no occasion for such a\nmodification. See, on the other hand, Bleuler, Sexuelle abnormit\u00e4ten der\nKinder (Jahrbuch der Schweizerischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr\nSchulgesundheitspflege, IX, 1908). A book by Mrs. Dr. H.v. Hug-Hellmuth,\nAus dem Seelenleben des Kindes (1913), has taken full account of the\nneglected sexual factors. [Translated in Monograph Series.]\n[3] I have attempted to solve the problems presented by the earliest\ninfantile recollections in a paper, \"\u00dcber Deckerinnerungen\"\n(Monatsschrift f\u00fcr Psychiatrie und Neurologie, VI, 1899). Cf. also The\nPsychopathology of Everyday Life, The Macmillan Co., New York, and\nUnwin, London.\n[4] One cannot understand the mechanism of repression when one takes\ninto consideration only one of the two cooperating processes. As a\ncomparison one may think of the way the tourist is despatched to the top\nof the great pyramid of Gizeh; he is pushed from one side and pulled\nfrom the other.\n[5] The use of the latter material is justified by the fact that the\nyears of childhood of those who are later neurotics need not necessarily\ndiffer from those who are later normal except in intensity and\ndistinctness.\n[6] An anatomic analogy to the behavior of the infantile sexual function\nformulated by me is perhaps given by Bayer (Deutsches Archiv f\u00fcr\nklinische Medizin, Bd. 73) who claims that the internal genitals\n(uterus) are regularly larger in newborn than in older children.\nHowever, Halban's conception, that after birth there is also an\ninvolution of the other parts of the sexual apparatus, has not been\nverified. According to Halban (Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geburtshilfe u.\nGyn\u00e4kologie, LIII, 1904) this process of involution ends after a few\nweeks of extra-uterine life.\n[7] The expression \"sexual latency period\" (sexuelle latenz-periode) I\nhave borrowed from W. Fliess.\n[8] In the case here discussed the sublimation of the sexual motive\npowers proceed on the road of reaction formations. But in general it is\nnecessary to separate from each other sublimation and reaction formation\nas two diverse processes. Sublimation may also result through other and\nsimpler mechanisms.\n[9] Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Kinderheilkunde, N.F., XIV, 1879.\n[10] This already shows what holds true for the whole life, namely, that\nsexual gratification is the best hypnotic. Most nervous insomnias are\ntraced to lack of sexual gratification. It is also known that\nunscrupulous nurses calm crying children to sleep by stroking their\ngenitals.\n[11] Ellis spoils, however, the sense of his invented term by comprising\nunder the phenomena of autoerotism the whole of hysteria and\nmasturbation in its full extent.\n[12] Further reflection and observation lead me to attribute the quality\nof erogenity to all parts of the body and inner organs. See later on\nnarcism.\n[13] Compare here the very comprehensive but confusing literature on\nonanism, _e.g._, Rohleder, Die Masturbation, 1899. Cf. also the\npamphlet, \"Die Onanie,\" which contains the discussion of the Vienna\nPsychoanalytic Society, Wiesbaden, 1912.\n[14] Compare here the essay on \"Charakter und Analerotic\" in the\nSammlung kleiner Schriften zur Neurosenlehre, Zweite Folge, 1909. Cf.\nalso Brill, Psychanalysis, Chap. XIII, Anal Eroticism and Character,\nW.B. Saunders, Philadelphia.\n[15] Unusual techniques in the performance of onanism seem to point to\nthe influence of a prohibition against onanism which has been overcome.\n[16] Why neurotics, when conscience stricken, regularly connect it with\ntheir onanistic activity, as was only recently recognized by Bleuler, is\na problem which still awaits an exhaustive analysis.\n[17] Freud, Selected Papers on Hysteria and Other Psychoneuroses, 3d\nedition, translated by A.A. Brill, N.Y. Nerv. and Ment. Dis. Pub. Co.\nNervous and Mental Disease Monograph, Series No. 4.\n[18] Havelock Ellis, in an appendix to his study on the Sexual Impulse,\n1903, gives a number of autobiographic reports of normal persons\ntreating their first sexual feelings in childhood and the causes of the\nsame. These reports naturally show the deficiency due to infantile\namnesia; they do not cover the prehistoric time in the sexual life and\ntherefore must be supplemented by psychoanalysis of individuals who\nbecame neurotic. Notwithstanding this these reports are valuable in more\nthan one respect, and information of a similar nature has urged me to\nmodify my etiological assumption as mentioned in the text.\n[19] The above-mentioned assertions concerning the infantile sexuality\nwere justified in 1905, in the main through the results of\npsychoanalytic investigations in adults. Direct observation of the child\ncould not at the time be utilized to its full extent and resulted only\nin individual indications and valuable confirmations. Since then it has\nbecome possible through the analysis of some cases of nervous disease in\nthe delicate age of childhood to gain a direct understanding of the\ninfantile psychosexuality (Jahrbuch f\u00fcr psychoanalytische und\npsychopathologische Forschungen, Bd. 1, 2, 1909). I can point with\nsatisfaction to the fact that direct observation has fully confirmed the\nconclusion drawn from psychoanalysis, and thus furnishes good evidence\nfor the reliability of the latter method of investigation.\nMoreover, the \"Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy\" (Jahrbuch,\nBd. 1) has taught us something new for which psychoanalysis had not\nprepared us, to wit, that sexual symbolism, the representation of the\nsexual by non-sexual objects and relations--reaches back into the years\nwhen the child is first learning to master the language. My attention\nhas also been directed to a deficiency in the above-cited statement\nwhich for the sake of clearness described any conceivable separation\nbetween the two phases of autoerotism and object love as a temporal\nseparation. From the cited analysis (as well as from the above-mentioned\nwork of Bell) we learn that children from three to five are capable of\nevincing a very strong object-selection which is accompanied by strong\naffects.\n[20] Some persons can recall that the contact of the moving air in\nswinging caused them direct sexual pleasure in the genitals.\n[21] \"Those who love each other tease each other.\"\n[22] The analyses of neurotic disturbances of walking and of agoraphobia\nremove all doubt as to the sexual nature of the pleasure of motion. As\neverybody knows modern cultural education utilizes sports to a great\nextent in order to turn away the youth from sexual activity; it would be\nmore proper to say that it replaces the sexual pleasure by motion\npleasure, and forces the sexual activity back upon one of its autoerotic\ncomponents.\nIII\nTHE TRANSFORMATION OF PUBERTY\nWith the beginning of puberty the changes set in which transform the\ninfantile sexual life into its definite normal form. Hitherto the sexual\nimpulse has been preponderantly autoerotic; it now finds the sexual\nobject. Thus far it has manifested itself in single impulses and in\nerogenous zones seeking a certain pleasure as a single sexual aim. A new\nsexual aim now appears for the production of which all partial impulses\nco\u00f6perate, while the erogenous zones subordinate themselves to the\nprimacy of the genital zone.[1] As the new sexual aim assigns very\ndifferent functions to the two sexes their sexual developments now part\ncompany. The sexual development of the man is more consistent and easier\nto understand, while in the woman there even appears a form of\nregression. The normality of the sexual life is guaranteed only by the\nexact concurrence of the two streams directed to the sexual object and\nsexual aim. It is like the piercing of a tunnel from opposite sides.\nThe new sexual aim in the man consists in the discharging of the sexual\nproducts; it is not contradictory to the former sexual aim, that of\nobtaining pleasure; on the contrary, the highest amount of pleasure is\nconnected with this final act in the sexual process. The sexual impulse\nnow enters into the service of the function of propagation; it becomes,\nso to say, altruistic. If this transformation is to succeed its process\nmust be adjusted to the original dispositions and all the peculiarities\nof the impulses.\nJust as on every other occasion where new connections and compositions\nare to be formed in complicated mechanisms, here, too, there is a\npossibility for morbid disturbance if the new order of things does not\nget itself established. All morbid disturbances of the sexual life may\njustly be considered as inhibitions of development.\nTHE PRIMACY OF THE GENITAL ZONES AND THE FORE-PLEASURE\nFrom the course of development as described we can clearly see the issue\nand the end aim. The intermediary transitions are still quite obscure\nand many a riddle will have to be solved in them.\nThe most striking process of puberty has been selected as its most\ncharacteristic; it is the manifest growth of the external genitals which\nhave shown a relative inhibition of growth during the latency period of\nchildhood. Simultaneously the inner genitals develop to such an extent\nas to be able to furnish sexual products or to receive them for the\npurpose of forming a new living being. A most complicated apparatus is\nthus formed which waits to be claimed.\nThis apparatus can be set in motion by stimuli, and observation teaches\nthat the stimuli can affect it in three ways: from the outer world\nthrough the familiar erogenous zones; from the inner organic world by\nways still to be investigated; and from the psychic life, which merely\nrepresents a depository of external impressions and a receptacle of\ninner excitations. The same result follows in all three cases, namely, a\nstate which can be designated as \"sexual excitation\" and which manifests\nitself in psychic and somatic signs. The psychic sign consists in a\npeculiar feeling of tension of a most urgent character, and among the\nmanifold somatic signs the many changes in the genitals stand first.\nThey have a definite meaning, that of readiness; they constitute a\npreparation for the sexual act (the erection of the penis and the\nglandular activity of the vagina).\n*The Sexual Tension*--The character of the tension of sexual excitation\nis connected with a problem the solution of which is as difficult as it\nwould be important for the conception of the sexual process. Despite all\ndivergence of opinion regarding it in psychology, I must firmly maintain\nthat a feeling of tension must carry with it the character of\ndispleasure. For me it is conclusive that such a feeling carries with it\nthe impulse to alter the psychic situation, and acts incitingly, which\nis quite contrary to the nature of perceived pleasure. But if we ascribe\nthe tension of the sexual excitation to the feelings of displeasure we\nencounter the fact that it is undoubtedly pleasurably perceived. The\ntension produced by sexual excitation is everywhere accompanied by\npleasure; even in the preparatory changes of the genitals there is a\ndistinct feeling of satisfaction. What relation is there between this\nunpleasant tension and this feeling of pleasure?\nEverything relating to the problem of pleasure and pain touches one of\nthe weakest spots of present-day psychology. We shall try if possible to\nlearn something from the determinations of the case in question and to\navoid encroaching on the problem as a whole. Let us first glance at the\nmanner in which the erogenous zones adjust themselves to the new order\nof things. An important r\u00f4le devolves upon them in the preparation of\nthe sexual excitation. The eye which is very remote from the sexual\nobject is most often in position, during the relations of object wooing,\nto become attracted by that particular quality of excitation, the motive\nof which we designate as beauty in the sexual object. The excellencies\nof the sexual object are therefore also called \"attractions.\" This\nattraction is on the one hand already connected with pleasure, and on\nthe other hand it either results in an increase of the sexual excitation\nor in an evocation of the same where it is still wanting. The effect is\nthe same if the excitation of another erogenous zone, _e.g._, the\ntouching hand, is added to it. There is on the one hand the feeling of\npleasure which soon becomes enhanced by the pleasure from the\npreparatory changes, and on the other hand there is a further increase\nof the sexual tension which soon changes into a most distinct feeling of\ndispleasure if it cannot proceed to more pleasure. Another case will\nperhaps be clearer; let us, for example, take the case where an\nerogenous zone, like a woman's breast, is excited by touching in a\nperson who is not sexually excited at the time. This touching in itself\nevokes a feeling of pleasure, but it is also best adapted to awaken\nsexual excitement which demands still more pleasure. How it happens that\nthe perceived pleasure evokes the desire for greater pleasure, that is\nthe real problem.\n*Fore-pleasure Mechanism.*--But the r\u00f4le which devolves upon the\nerogenous zones is clear. What applies to one applies to all. They are\nall utilized to furnish a certain amount of pleasure through their own\nproper excitation, which increases the tension, and which is in turn\ndestined to produce the necessary motor energy in order to bring to a\nconclusion the sexual act. The last part but one of this act is again a\nsuitable excitation of an erogenous zone; _i.e._, the genital zone\nproper of the glans penis is excited by the object most fit for it, the\nmucous membrane of the vagina, and through the pleasure furnished by\nthis excitation it now produces reflexly the motor energy which conveys\nto the surface the sexual substance. This last pleasure is highest in\nits intensity, and differs from the earliest ones in its mechanism. It\nis altogether produced through discharge, it is altogether gratification\npleasure and the tension of the libido temporarily dies away with it.\nIt does not seem to me unjustified to fix by name the distinction in the\nnature of these pleasures, the one through the excitation of the\nerogenous zones, and the other through the discharge of the sexual\nsubstance. In contradistinction to the end-pleasure, or pleasure of\ngratification of sexual activity, we can properly designate the first as\n_fore-pleasure_. The fore-pleasure is then the same as that furnished by\nthe infantile sexual impulse, though on a reduced scale; while the\n_end-pleasure_ is new and is probably connected with determinations\nwhich first appear at puberty. The formula for the new function of the\nerogenous zones reads as follows: they are utilized for the purpose of\nmaking possible the production of the greater pleasure of gratification\nby means of the fore-pleasure which is gained from them as in infantile\nlife.\nI have recently been able to elucidate another example from a quite\ndifferent realm of the psychic life, in which likewise a greater feeling\nof pleasure is achieved by means of a lesser feeling of pleasure which\nthereby acts as an alluring premium. We had there also the opportunity\nof entering more deeply into the nature of pleasure.[2]\n*Dangers of the Fore-pleasure.*--However the connection of fore-pleasure\nwith the infantile life is strengthened by the pathogenic r\u00f4le which may\ndevolve upon it. In the mechanism through which the fore-pleasure is\nexpressed there exists an obvious danger to the attainment of the normal\nsexual aim. This occurs if it happens that there is too much\nfore-pleasure and too little tension in any part of the preparatory\nsexual process. The motive power for the further continuation of the\nsexual process then escapes, the whole road becomes shortened, and the\npreparatory action in question takes the place of the normal sexual aim.\nExperience shows that such a hurtful condition is determined by the fact\nthat the erogenous zone concerned or the corresponding partial impulse\nhas already contributed an unusual amount of pleasure in infantile life.\nIf other factors favoring fixation are added a compulsion readily\nresults for the later life which prevents the fore-pleasure from\narranging itself into a new combination. Indeed, the mechanism of many\nperversions is of such a nature; they merely represent a lingering at a\npreparatory act of the sexual process.\nThe failure of the function of the sexual mechanism through the fault of\nthe fore-pleasure is generally avoided if the primacy of the genital\nzones has also already been sketched out in infantile life. The\npreparations of the second half of childhood (from the eighth year to\npuberty) really seem to favor this. During these years the genital zones\nbehave almost as at the age of maturity; they are the seat of exciting\nsensations and of preparatory changes if any kind of pleasure is\nexperienced through the gratification of other erogenous zones; although\nthis effect remains aimless, _i.e._, it contributes nothing towards the\ncontinuation of the sexual process. Besides the pleasure of\ngratification a certain amount of sexual tension appears even in\ninfancy, though it is less constant and less abundant. We can now\nunderstand also why in the discussion of the sources of sexuality we had\na perfectly good reason for saying that the process in question acts as\nsexual gratification as well as sexual excitement. We note that on our\nway towards the truth we have at first enormously exaggerated the\ndistinctions between the infantile and the mature sexual life, and we\ntherefore supplement what has been said with a correction. The infantile\nmanifestations of sexuality determine not only the deviations from the\nnormal sexual life but also the normal formations of the same.\nTHE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL EXCITEMENT\nIt remains entirely unexplained whence the sexual tension comes which\noriginates simultaneously with the gratification of erogenous zones and\nwhat is its nature. The obvious supposition that this tension originates\nin some way from the pleasure itself is not only improbable in itself\nbut untenable, inasmuch as during the greatest pleasure which is\nconnected with the voiding of sexual substance there is no production of\ntension but rather a removal of all tension. Hence, pleasure and sexual\ntension can be only indirectly connected.\n*The R\u00f4le of the Sexual Substance.*--Aside from the fact that only the\ndischarge of the sexual substance can normally put an end to the sexual\nexcitement, there are other essential facts which bring the sexual\ntension into relation with the sexual products. In a life of continence\nthe sexual activity is wont to discharge the sexual substance at night\nduring pleasurable dream hallucinations of a sexual act, this discharge\ncoming at changing but not at entirely capricious intervals; and the\nfollowing interpretation of this process--the nocturnal pollution--can\nhardly be rejected, viz., that the sexual tension which brings about a\nsubstitute for the sexual act by the short hallucinatory road is a\nfunction of the accumulated semen in the reservoirs for the sexual\nproducts. Experiences with the exhaustibility of the sexual mechanism\nspeak for the same thing. Where there is no stock of semen it is not\nonly impossible to accomplish the sexual act, but there is also a lack\nof excitability in the erogenous zones, the suitable excitation of which\ncan evoke no pleasure. We thus discover incidentally that a certain\namount of sexual tension is itself necessary for the excitability of the\nerogenous zones.\nOne would thus be forced to the assumption, which if I am not mistaken\nis quite generally adopted, that the accumulation of sexual substance\nproduces and maintains the sexual tension. The pressure of these\nproducts on the walls of their receptacles acts as an excitant on the\nspinal center, the state of which is then perceived by the higher\ncenters which then produce in consciousness the familiar feeling of\ntension. If the excitation of erogenous zones increases the sexual\ntension, it can only be due to the fact that the erogenous zones are\nconnected with these centers by previously formed anatomical\nconnections. They increase there the tone of the excitation, and with\nsufficient sexual tension they set in motion the sexual act, and with\ninsufficient tension they merely stimulate a production of the sexual\nsubstance.\nThe weakness of the theory which one finds adopted, _e.g._, in v.\nKrafft-Ebing's description of the sexual process, lies in the fact that\nit has been formed for the sexual activity of the mature man and pays\ntoo little heed to three kinds of relations which should also have been\nelucidated. We refer to the relations as found in the child, in the\nwoman, and in the castrated male. In none of the three cases can we\nspeak of an accumulation of sexual products in the same sense as in the\nman, which naturally renders difficult the general application of this\nscheme; still it may be admitted without any further ado that ways can\nbe found to justify the subordination of even these cases. Nevertheless\none should be cautious about burdening the factor of accumulation of\nsexual products with actions which it seems incapable of supporting.\n*Overestimation of the Internal Genitals.*--That sexual excitement can\nbe independent to a considerable extent of the production of sexual\nsubstance seems to be shown by observations on castrated males, in whom\nthe libido sometimes escapes the injury caused by the operation,\nalthough the opposite behavior, which is really the motive for the\noperation, is usually the rule. It is therefore not at all surprising,\nas C. Rieger puts it, that the loss of the male germ glands in maturer\nage should exert no new influence on the psychic life of the individual.\nThe germ glands are really not the sexuality, and the experience with\ncastrated males only verifies what we had long before learned from the\nremoval of the ovaries, namely that it is impossible to do away with the\nsexual character by removing the germ glands. To be sure, castration\nperformed at a tender age, before puberty, comes nearer to this aim, but\nit would seem in this case that besides the loss of the sexual glands we\nmust also consider the inhibition of development and other factors\nwhich are connected with that loss.\n*Chemical Theories.*--The truth remains, however, that we are unable to\ngive any information about the nature of the sexual excitement for the\nreason that we do not know with what organ or organs sexuality is\nconnected, since we have seen that the sexual glands have been\noverestimated in this significance. Since surprising discoveries have\ntaught us the important r\u00f4le of the thyroid gland in sexuality, we may\nassume that the knowledge of the essential factors of sexuality are\nstill withheld from us. One who feels the need of filling up the large\ngap in our knowledge with a preliminary assumption may formulate for\nhimself the following theory based on the active substances found in the\nthyroid. Through the appropriate excitement of erogenous zones, as well\nas through other conditions under which sexual excitement originates, a\nmaterial which is universally distributed in the organism becomes\ndisintegrated, the decomposing products of which supply a specific\nstimulus to the organs of reproduction or to the spinal center connected\nwith them. Such a transformation of a toxic stimulus in a particular\norganic stimulus we are already familiar with from other toxic products\nintroduced into the body from without. To treat, if only hypothetically,\nthe complexities of the pure toxic and the physiologic stimulations\nwhich result in the sexual processes is not now our appropriate task. To\nbe sure, I attach no value to this special assumption and I shall be\nquite ready to give it up in favor of another, provided its original\ncharacter, the emphasis on the sexual chemism, were preserved. For this\napparently arbitrary statement is supported by a fact which, though\nlittle heeded, is most noteworthy. The neuroses which can be traced only\nto disturbances of the sexual life show the greatest clinical\nresemblance to the phenomena of intoxication and abstinence which result\nfrom the habitual introduction of pleasure-producing poisonous\nsubstances (alkaloids.)\nTHE THEORY OF THE LIBIDO\nThese assumptions concerning the chemical basis of the sexual excitement\nare in full accord with the auxiliary conception which we formed for the\npurpose of mastering the psychic manifestations of the sexual life. We\nhave determined the concept of _libido_ as that of a force of variable\nquantity which has the capacity of measuring processes and\ntransformations in the spheres of sexual excitement. This libido we\ndistinguished from the energy which is to be generally adjudged to the\npsychic processes with reference to its special origin and thus we\nattribute to it also a qualitative character. In separating libidinous\nfrom other psychic energy we give expression to the assumption that the\nsexual processes of the organism are differentiated from the nutritional\nprocesses through a special chemism. The analyses of perversions and\npsychoneuroses have taught us that this sexual excitement is furnished\nnot only from the so-called sexual parts alone but from all organs of\nthe body. We thus formulate for ourselves the concept of a\nlibido-quantum whose psychic representative we designate as the\nego-libido; the production, increase, distribution and displacement of\nthis ego-libido will offer the possible explanation for the observed\npsycho-sexual phenomena.\nBut this ego-libido becomes conveniently accessible to psychoanalytic\nstudy only when the psychic energy is employed on sexual objects, that\nis when it becomes object libido. Then we see it as it concentrates and\nfixes itself on objects, or as it leaves those objects and passes over\nto others from which positions it directs the individual's sexual\nactivity, that is, it leads to partial and temporary extinction of the\nlibido. Psychoanalysis of the so-called transference neuroses (hysteria\nand compulsion neurosis) offers us here a reliable insight.\nConcerning the fates of the object libido we also state that it is\nwithdrawn from the object, that it is preserved floating in special\nstates of tension and is finally taken back into the ego, so that it\nagain becomes ego-libido. In contradistinction to the object-libido we\nalso call the ego-libido narcissistic libido. From psychoanalysis we\nlook over the boundary which we are not permitted to pass into the\nactivity of the narcissistic libido and thus form an idea of the\nrelations between the two. The narcissistic or ego-libido appears to us\nas the great reservoir from which the energy for the investment of the\nobject is sent out and into which it is drawn back again, while the\nnarcissistic libido investment of the ego appears to us as the realized\nprimitive state in the first childhood, which only becomes hidden by the\nlater emissions of the libido, and is retained at the bottom behind\nthem.\nThe task of a theory of libido of neurotic and psychotic disturbances\nwould have for its object to express in terms of the libido-economy all\nobserved phenomena and disclosed processes. It is easy to divine that\nthe greater significance would attach thereby to the destinies of the\nego-libido, especially where it would be the question of explaining the\ndeeper psychotic disturbances. The difficulty then lies in the fact that\nthe means of our investigation, psychoanalysis, at present gives us\ndefinite information only concerning the transformation of the\nobject-libido, but cannot distinguish without further study the\nego-libido from the other effective energies in the ego.[3]\nDIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN\nIt is known that the sharp differentiation of the male and female\ncharacter originates at puberty, and it is the resulting difference\nwhich, more than any other factor, decisively influences the later\ndevelopment of personality. To be sure, the male and female dispositions\nare easily recognizable even in infantile life; thus the development of\nsexual inhibitions (shame, loathing, sympathy, etc.) ensues earlier and\nwith less resistance in the little girl than in the little boy. The\ntendency to sexual repression certainly seems much greater, and where\npartial impulses of sexuality are noticed they show a preference for the\npassive form. But, the autoerotic activity of the erogenous zones is the\nsame in both sexes, and it is this agreement that removes the\npossibility of a sex differentiation in childhood as it appears after\npuberty. In respect to the autoerotic and masturbatic sexual\nmanifestations, it may be asserted that the sexuality of the little girl\nhas entirely a male character. Indeed, if one could give a more definite\ncontent to the terms \"masculine and feminine,\" one might advance the\nopinion that _the libido is regularly and lawfully of a masculine\nnature, whether in the man or in the woman; and if we consider its\nobject, this may be either the man or the woman_.[4]\nSince becoming acquainted with the aspect of bisexuality I hold this\nfactor as here decisive, and I believe that without taking into account\nthe factor of bisexuality it will hardly be possible to understand the\nactually observed sexual manifestations in man and woman.\n*The Leading Zones in Man and Woman.*--Further than this I can only add\nthe following. The chief erogenous zone in the female child is the\nclitoris, which is homologous to the male penis. All I have been able to\ndiscover concerning masturbation in little girls concerned the clitoris\nand not those other external genitals which are so important for the\nlater sexual functions. With few exceptions I myself doubt whether the\nfemale child can be seduced to anything but clitoris masturbation. The\nfrequent spontaneous discharges of sexual excitement in little girls\nmanifest themselves in a twitching of the clitoris, and its frequent\nerections enable the girl to understand correctly even without any\ninstruction the sexual manifestations of the other sex; they simply\ntransfer to the boys the sensations of their own sexual processes.\nIf one wishes to understand how the little girl becomes a woman, he must\nfollow up the further destinies of this clitoris excitation. Puberty,\nwhich brings to the boy a great advance of libido, distinguishes itself\nin the girl by a new wave of repression which especially concerns the\nclitoris sexuality. It is a part of the male sexual life that sinks into\nrepression. The re\u00ebnforcement of the sexual inhibitions produced in the\nwoman by the repression of puberty causes a stimulus in the libido of\nthe man and forces it to increase its capacity; with the height of the\nlibido there is a rise in the overestimation of the sexual, which can be\npresent in its full force only when the woman refuses and denies her\nsexuality. If the sexual act is finally submitted to and the clitoris\nbecomes excited its r\u00f4le is then to conduct the excitement to the\nadjacent female parts, and in this it acts like a chip of pine wood\nwhich is utilized to set fire to the harder wood. It often takes some\ntime for this transference to be accomplished; during which the young\nwife remains anesthetic. This anesthesia may become permanent if the\nclitoris zone refuses to give up its excitability; a condition brought\non by abundant activities in infantile life. It is known that anesthesia\nin women is often only apparent and local. They are anesthetic at the\nvaginal entrance but not at all unexcitable through the clitoris or even\nthrough other zones. Besides these erogenous causes of anesthesia there\nare also psychic causes likewise determined by the repression.\nIf the transference of the erogenous excitability from the clitoris to\nthe vagina has succeeded, the woman has thus changed her leading zone\nfor the future sexual activity; the man on the other hand retains his\nfrom childhood. The main determinants for the woman's preference for the\nneuroses, especially for hysteria, lie in this change of the leading\nzone as well as in the repression of puberty. These determinants are\ntherefore most intimately connected with the nature of femininity.\nTHE OBJECT-FINDING\nWhile the primacy of the genital zones is being established through the\nprocesses of puberty, and the erected penis in the man imperiously\npoints towards the new sexual aim, _i.e._, towards the penetration of a\ncavity which excites the genital zone, the object-finding, for which\nalso preparations have been made since early childhood, becomes\nconsummated on the psychic side. While the very incipient sexual\ngratifications are still connected with the taking of nourishment, the\nsexual impulse has a sexual object outside its own body in his mother's\nbreast. This object it loses later, perhaps at the very time when it\nbecomes possible for the child to form a general picture of the person\nto whom the organ granting him the gratification belongs. The sexual\nimpulse later regularly becomes autoerotic, and only after overcoming\nthe latency period is there a resumption of the original relation. It is\nnot without good reason that the suckling of the child at its mother's\nbreast has become a model for every amour. The object-finding is really\na re-finding.[5]\n*The Sexual Object of the Nursing Period.*--However, even after the\nseparation of the sexual activity from the taking of nourishment, there\nstill remains from this first and most important of all sexual relations\nan important share, which prepares the object selection and assists in\nreestablishing the lost happiness. Throughout the latency period the\nchild learns to love other persons who assist it in its helplessness and\ngratify its wants; all this follows the model and is a continuation of\nthe child's infantile relations to his wet nurse. One may perhaps\nhesitate to identify the tender feelings and esteem of the child for his\nfoster-parents with sexual love; I believe, however, that a more\nthorough psychological investigation will establish this identity beyond\nany doubt. The intercourse between the child and its foster-parents is\nfor the former an inexhaustible source of sexual excitation and\ngratification of erogenous zones, especially since the parents--or as a\nrule the mother--supplies the child with feelings which originate from\nher own sexual life; she pats it, kisses it, and rocks it, plainly\ntaking it as a substitute for a full-valued sexual object.[6] The mother\nwould probably be terrified if it were explained to her that all her\ntenderness awakens the sexual impulse of her child and prepares its\nfuture intensity. She considers her actions as asexually \"pure\" love,\nfor she carefully avoids causing more irritation to the genitals of the\nchild than is indispensable in caring for the body. But as we know the\nsexual impulse is not awakened by the excitation of genital zones alone.\nWhat we call tenderness will some day surely manifest its influence on\nthe genital zones also. If the mother better understood the high\nsignificance of the sexual impulse for the whole psychic life and for\nall ethical and psychic activities, the enlightenment would spare her\nall reproaches. By teaching the child to love she only fulfills her\nfunction; for the child should become a fit man with energetic sexual\nneeds, and accomplish in life all that the impulse urges the man to do.\nOf course, too much parental tenderness becomes harmful because it\naccelerates the sexual maturity, and also because it \"spoils\" the child\nand makes it unfit to temporarily renounce love or be satisfied with a\nsmaller amount of love in later life. One of the surest premonitions of\nlater nervousness is the fact that the child shows itself insatiable in\nits demands for parental tenderness; on the other hand, neuropathic\nparents, who usually display a boundless tenderness, often with their\ncaressing awaken in the child a disposition for neurotic diseases. This\nexample at least shows that neuropathic parents have nearer ways than\ninheritance by which they can transfer their disturbances to their\nchildren.\n*Infantile Fear.*--The children themselves behave from their early\nchildhood as if their attachment to their foster-parents were of the\nnature of sexual love. The fear of children is originally nothing but an\nexpression for the fact that they miss the beloved person. They\ntherefore meet every stranger with fear, they are afraid of the dark\nbecause they cannot see the beloved person, and are calmed if they can\ngrasp that person's hand. The effect of childish fears and of the\nterrifying stories told by nurses is overestimated if one blames the\nlatter for producing the fear in children. Children who are predisposed\nto fear absorb these stories, which make no impression whatever upon\nothers; and only such children are predisposed to fear whose sexual\nimpulse is excessive or prematurely developed, or has become exigent\nthrough pampering. The child behaves here like the adult, that is, it\nchanges its libido into fear when it cannot bring it to gratification,\nand the grown-up who becomes neurotic on account of ungratified libido\nbehaves in his anxiety like a child; he fears when he is alone, _i.e._,\nwithout a person of whose love he believes himself sure, and who can\ncalm his fears by means of the most childish measures.[7]\n*Incest Barriers.*--If the tenderness of the parents for the child has\nluckily failed to awaken the sexual impulse of the child prematurely,\n_i.e._, before the physical determinations for puberty appear, and if\nthat awakening has not gone so far as to cause an unmistakable breaking\nthrough of the psychic excitement into the genital system, it can then\nfulfill its task and direct the child at the age of maturity in the\nselection of the sexual object. It would, of course, be most natural for\nthe child to select as the sexual object that person whom it has loved\nsince childhood with, so to speak, a suppressed libido.[8] But owing to\nthe delay of sexual maturity time has been gained for the erection\nbeside the sexual inhibitions of the incest barrier, that moral\nprescription which explicitly excludes from the object selection the\nbeloved person of infancy or blood relation. The observance of this\nbarrier is above all a demand of cultural society which must guard\nagainst the absorption by the family of those interests which it needs\nfor the production of higher social units. Society, therefore, uses\nevery means to loosen those family ties in every individual, especially\nin the boy, which are authoritative in childhood only.[9]\nThe object selection, however, is first accomplished in the imagination,\nand the sexual life of the maturing youth has hardly any escape except\nindulgence in phantasies or ideas which are not destined to be brought\nto execution. In the phantasies of all persons the infantile\ninclinations, now re\u00ebnforced by somatic emphasis, reappear, and among\nthem one finds in regular frequency and in the first place the sexual\nfeeling of the child for the parents. This has usually already been\ndifferentiated by the sexual attraction, the attraction of the son for\nthe mother and of the daughter for the father.[10] Simultaneously with\nthe overcoming and rejection of these distinctly incestuous phantasies\nthere occurs one of the most important as well as one of the most\npainful psychic accomplishments of puberty; it is the breaking away from\nthe parental authority, through which alone is formed that opposition\nbetween the new and old generations which is so important for cultural\nprogress. Many persons are detained at each of the stations in the\ncourse of development through which the individual must pass; and\naccordingly there are persons who never overcome the parental authority\nand never, or very imperfectly, withdraw their affection from their\nparents. They are mostly girls, who, to the delight of their parents,\nretain their full infantile love far beyond puberty, and it is\ninstructive to find that in their married life these girls are incapable\nof fulfilling their duties to their husbands. They make cold wives and\nremain sexually anesthetic. This shows that the apparently non-sexual\nlove for the parents and the sexual love are nourished from the same\nsource, _i.e._, that the first merely corresponds to an infantile\nfixation of the libido.\nThe nearer we come to the deeper disturbances of the psychosexual\ndevelopment the more easily we can recognize the evident significance of\nthe incestuous object-selection. As a result of sexual rejection there\nremains in the unconscious of the psychoneurotic a great part or the\nwhole of the psychosexual activity for object finding. Girls with an\nexcessive need for affection and an equal horror for the real demands of\nthe sexual life experience an uncontrollable temptation on the one hand\nto realize in life the ideal of the asexual love and on the other hand\nto conceal their libido under an affection which they may manifest\nwithout self reproach; this they do by clinging for life to the\ninfantile attraction for their parents or brothers or sisters which has\nbeen repressed in puberty. With the help of the symptoms and other\nmorbid manifestations, psychoanalysis can trace their unconscious\nthoughts and translate them into the conscious, and thus easily show to\nsuch persons that they are in love with their consanguinous relations in\nthe popular meaning of the term. Likewise when a once healthy person\nfalls sick after an unhappy love affair, the mechanism of the disease\ncan distinctly be explained as a return of his libido to the persons\npreferred in his infancy.\n*The After Effects of the Infantile Object Selection.*--Even those who\nhave happily eluded the incestuous fixation of their libido have not\ncompletely escaped its influence. It is a distinct echo of this phase of\ndevelopment that the first serious love of the young man is often for a\nmature woman and that of the girl for an older man equipped with\nauthority--_i.e._, for persons who can revive in them the picture of the\nmother and father. Generally speaking object selection unquestionably\ntakes place by following more freely these prototypes. The man seeks\nabove all the memory picture of his mother as it has dominated him since\nthe beginning of childhood; this is quite consistent with the fact that\nthe mother, if still living, strives against this, her renewal, and\nmeets it with hostility. In view of this significance of the infantile\nrelation to the parents for the later selection of the sexual object, it\nis easy to understand that every disturbance of this infantile relation\nbrings to a head the most serious results for the sexual life after\npuberty. Jealousy of the lover, too, never lacks the infantile sources\nor at least the infantile reinforcement. Quarrels between parents and\nunhappy marital relations between the same determine the severest\npredispositions for disturbed sexual development or neurotic diseases in\nthe children.\nThe infantile desire for the parents is, to be sure, the most important,\nbut not the only trace revived in puberty which points the way to the\nobject selection. Other dispositions of the same origin permit the man,\nstill supported by his infancy, to develop more than one single sexual\nseries and to form different determinations for the object\nselection.[11]\n*Prevention of Inversion.*--One of the tasks imposed in the object\nselection consists in not missing the opposite sex. This, as we know, is\nnot solved without some difficulty. The first feelings after puberty\noften enough go astray, though not with any permanent injury. Dessoir\nhas called attention to the normality of the enthusiastic friendships\nformed by boys and girls with their own sex. The greatest force which\nguards against a permanent inversion of the sexual object is surely the\nattraction exerted by the opposite sex characters on each other. For\nthis we can give no explanation in connection with this discussion. This\nfactor, however, does not in itself suffice to exclude the inversion;\nbesides this there are surely many other supporting factors. Above all,\nthere is the authoritative inhibition of society; experience shows that\nwhere the inversion is not considered a crime it fully corresponds to\nthe sexual inclinations of many persons. Moreover, it may be assumed\nthat in the man the infantile memories of the mother's tenderness, as\nwell as that of other females who cared for him as a child,\nenergetically assist in directing his selection to the woman, while the\nearly sexual intimidation experienced through the father and the\nattitude of rivalry existing between them deflects the boy from the same\nsex. Both factors also hold true in the case of the girl whose sexual\nactivity is under the special care of the mother. This results in a\nhostile relation to the same sex which decisively influences the object\nselection in the normal sense. The bringing up of boys by male persons\n(slaves in the ancient times) seems to favor homosexuality; the\nfrequency of inversion in the present day nobility is probably explained\nby their employment of male servants, and by the scant care that mothers\nof that class give to their children. It happens in some hysterics that\none of the parents has disappeared (through death, divorce, or\nestrangement), thus permitting the remaining parent to absorb all the\nlove of the child, and in this way establishing the determinations for\nthe sex of the person to be selected later as the sexual object; thus a\npermanent inversion is made possible.\nSUMMARY\nIt is now time to attempt a summing-up. We have started from the\naberrations of the sexual impulse in reference to its object and aim and\nhave encountered the question whether these originate from a congenital\npredisposition, or whether they are acquired in consequence of\ninfluences from life. The answer to this question was reached through an\nexamination of the relations of the sexual life of psychoneurotics, a\nnumerous group not very remote from the normal. This examination has\nbeen made through psychoanalytic investigations. We have thus found that\na tendency to all perversions might be demonstrated in these persons in\nthe form of unconscious forces revealing themselves as symptom creators\nand we could say that the neurosis is, as it were, the negative of the\nperversion. In view of the now recognized great diffusion of tendencies\nto perversion the idea forced itself upon us that the disposition to\nperversions is the primitive and universal disposition of the human\nsexual impulse, from which the normal sexual behavior develops in\nconsequence of organic changes and psychic inhibitions in the course of\nmaturity. We hoped to be able to demonstrate the original disposition in\nthe infantile life; among the forces restraining the direction of the\nsexual impulse we have mentioned shame, loathing and sympathy, and the\nsocial constructions of morality and authority. We have thus been forced\nto perceive in every fixed aberration from the normal sexual life a\nfragment of inhibited development and infantilism. The significance of\nthe variations of the original dispositions had to be put into the\nforeground, but between them and the influences of life we had to assume\na relation of co\u00f6peration and not of opposition. On the other hand, as\nthe original disposition must have been a complex one, the sexual\nimpulse itself appeared to us as something composed of many factors,\nwhich in the perversions becomes separated, as it were, into its\ncomponents. The perversions, thus prove themselves to be on the one hand\ninhibitions, and on the other dissociations from the normal development.\nBoth conceptions became united in the assumption that the sexual impulse\nof the adult due to the composition of the diverse feelings of the\ninfantile life became formed into one unit, one striving, with one\nsingle aim.\nWe also added an explanation for the preponderance of perversive\ntendencies in the psychoneurotics by recognizing in these tendencies\ncollateral fillings of side branches caused by the shifting of the main\nriver bed through repression, and we then turned our examination to the\nsexual life of the infantile period.[12] We found it regrettable that\nthe existence of a sexual life in infancy has been disputed, and that\nthe sexual manifestations which have been often observed in children\nhave been described as abnormal occurrences. It rather seemed to us that\nthe child brings along into the world germs of sexual activity and that\neven while taking nourishment it at the same time also enjoys a sexual\ngratification which it then seeks again to procure for itself through\nthe familiar activity of \"thumbsucking.\" The sexual activity of the\nchild, however, does not develop in the same measure as its other\nfunctions, but merges first into the so-called latency period from the\nage of three to the age of five years. The production of sexual\nexcitation by no means ceases at this period but continues and furnishes\na stock of energy, the greater part of which is utilized for aims other\nthan sexual; namely, on the one hand for the delivery of sexual\ncomponents for social feelings, and on the other hand (by means of\nrepression and reaction formation) for the erection of the future sexual\nbarriers. Accordingly, the forces which are destined to hold the sexual\nimpulse in certain tracks are built up in infancy at the expense of the\ngreater part of the perverse sexual feelings and with the assistance of\neducation. Another part of the infantile sexual manifestations escapes\nthis utilization and may manifest itself as sexual activity. It can then\nbe discovered that the sexual excitation of the child flows from diverse\nsources. Above all gratifications originate through the adapted sensible\nexcitation of so-called erogenous zones. For these probably any skin\nregion or sensory organ may serve; but there are certain distinguished\nerogenous zones the excitation of which by certain organic mechanisms is\nassured from the beginning. Moreover, sexual excitation originates in\nthe organism, as it were, as a by-product in a great number of\nprocesses, as soon as they attain a certain intensity; this especially\ntakes place in all strong emotional excitements even if they be of a\npainful nature. The excitations from all these sources do not yet unite,\nbut they pursue their aim individually--this aim consisting merely in\nthe gaining of a certain pleasure. The sexual impulse of childhood is\ntherefore objectless or _autoerotic_.\nStill during infancy the erogenous zone of the genitals begins to make\nitself noticeable, either by the fact that like any other erogenous zone\nit furnishes gratification through a suitable sensible stimulus, or\nbecause in some incomprehensible way the gratification from other\nsources causes at the same time the sexual excitement which has a\nspecial connection with the genital zone. We found cause to regret that\na sufficient explanation of the relations between sexual gratification\nand sexual excitement, as well as between the activity of the genital\nzone and the remaining sources of sexuality, was not to be attained.\nWe were unable to state what amount of sexual activity in childhood\nmight be designated as normal to the extent of being incapable of\nfurther development. The character of the sexual manifestation showed\nitself to be preponderantly masturbatic. We, moreover, verified from\nexperience the belief that the external influences of seduction, might\nproduce premature breaches in the latency period leading as far as the\nsuppression of the same, and that the sexual impulse of the child really\nshows itself to be polymorphous-perverse; furthermore, that every such\npremature sexual activity impairs the educability of the child.\nDespite the incompleteness of our examinations of the infantile sexual\nlife we were subsequently forced to attempt to study the serious changes\nproduced by the appearance of puberty. We selected two of the same as\ncriteria, namely, the subordination of all other sources of the sexual\nfeeling to the primacy of the genital zones, and the process of object\nfinding. Both of them are already developed in childhood. The first is\naccomplished through the mechanism of utilizing the fore-pleasure,\nwhereby all other independent sexual acts which are connected with\npleasure and excitement become preparatory acts for the new sexual aim,\nthe voiding of the sexual products, the attainment of which under\nenormous pleasure puts an end to the sexual feeling. At the same time we\nhad to consider the differentiation of the sexual nature of man and\nwoman, and we found that in order to become a woman a new repression is\nrequired which abolishes a piece of infantile masculinity, and prepares\nthe woman for the change of the leading genital zones. Lastly, we found\nthe object selection, tracing it through infancy to its revival in\npuberty; we also found indications of sexual inclinations on the part of\nthe child for the parents and foster-parents, which, however, were\nturned away from these persons to others resembling them by the incest\nbarriers which had been erected in the meantime. Let us finally add that\nduring the transition period of puberty the somatic and psychic\nprocesses of development proceed side by side, but separately, until\nwith the breaking through of an intense psychic love-stimulus for the\ninnervation of the genitals, the normally demanded unification of the\nerotic function is established.\n*The Factors Disturbing the Development.*--As we have already shown by\ndifferent examples, every step on this long road of development may\nbecome a point of fixation and every joint in this complicated structure\nmay afford opportunity for a dissociation of the sexual impulse. It\nstill remains for us to review the various inner and outer factors which\ndisturb the development, and to mention the part of the mechanism\naffected by the disturbance emanating from them. The factors which we\nmention here in a series cannot, of course, all be in themselves of\nequal validity and we must expect to meet with difficulties in the\nassigning to the individual factors their due importance.\n*Constitution and Heredity.*--In the first place, we must mention here\nthe congenital _variation of the sexual constitution_, upon which the\ngreatest weight probably falls, but the existence of which, as may be\neasily understood, can be established only through its later\nmanifestations and even then not always with great certainty. We\nunderstand by it a preponderance of one or another of the manifold\nsources of the sexual excitement, and we believe that such a difference\nof disposition must always come to expression in the final result, even\nif it should remain within normal limits. Of course, we can also imagine\ncertain variations of the original disposition that even without further\naid must necessarily lead to the formation of an abnormal sexual life.\nOne can call these \"degenerative\" and consider them as an expression of\nhereditary deterioration. In this connection I have to report a\nremarkable fact. In more than half of the severe cases of hysteria,\ncompulsion neuroses, etc., which I have treated by psychotherapy, I have\nsucceeded in positively demonstrating that their fathers have gone\nthrough an attack of syphilis before marriage; they have either suffered\nfrom tabes or general paresis, or there was a definite history of lues.\nI expressly add that the children who were later neurotic showed\nabsolutely no signs of hereditary lues, so that the abnormal sexual\nconstitution was to be considered as the last off-shoot of the luetic\nheredity. As far as it is now from my thoughts to put down a descent\nfrom syphilitic parents as a regular and indispensable etiological\ndetermination of the neuropathic constitution, I nevertheless maintain\nthat the coincidence observed by me is not accidental and not without\nsignificance.\nThe hereditary relations of the positive perverts are not so well known\nbecause they know how to avoid inquiry. Still there is reason to believe\nthat the same holds true in the perversions as in the neuroses. We often\nfind perversions and psychoneuroses in the different sexes of the same\nfamily, so distributed that the male members, or one of them, is a\npositive pervert, while the females, following the repressive tendencies\nof their sex, are negative perverts or hysterics. This is a good example\nof the substantial relations between the two disturbances which I have\ndiscovered.\n*Further Elaboration.*--It cannot, however, be maintained that the\nstructure of the sexual life is rendered finally complete by the\naddition of the diverse components of the sexual constitution. On the\ncontrary, qualifications continue to appear and new possibilities\nresult, depending upon the fate experienced by the sexual streams\noriginating from the individual sources. This _further elaboration_ is\nevidently the final and decisive one while the constitution described as\nuniform may lead to three final issues. If all the dispositions assumed\nto be abnormal retain their relative proportion, and are strengthened\nwith maturity, the ultimate result can only be a perverse sexual life.\nThe analysis of such abnormally constituted dispositions has not yet\nbeen thoroughly undertaken, but we already know cases that can be\nreadily explained in the light of these theories. Authors believe, for\nexample, that a whole series of fixation perversions must necessarily\nhave had as their basis a congenital weakness of the sexual impulse. The\nstatement seems to me untenable in this form, but it becomes ingenious\nif it refers to a constitutional weakness of one factor in the sexual\nimpulse, namely, the genital zone, which later in the interests of\npropagation accepts as a function the sum of the individual sexual\nactivities. In this case the summation which is demanded in puberty must\nfail and the strongest of the other sexual components continues its\nactivity as a perversion.[13]\n*Repression.*--Another issue results if in the course of development\ncertain powerful components experience a _repression_--which we must\ncarefully note is not a suspension. The excitations in question are\nproduced as usual but are prevented from attaining their aim by psychic\nhindrances, and are driven off into many other paths until they express\nthemselves in a symptom. The result can be an almost normal sexual\nlife--usually a limited one--but supplemented by psychoneurotic disease.\nIt is these cases that become so familiar to us through the\npsychoanalytic investigation of neurotics. The sexual life of such\npersons begins like that of perverts, a considerable part of their\nchildhood is filled up with perverse sexual activity which occasionally\nextends far beyond the period of maturity, but owing to inner reasons a\nrepressive change then results--usually before puberty, but now and then\neven much later--and from this point on without any extinction of the\nold feelings there appears a neurosis instead of a perversion. One may\nrecall here the saying, \"Junge Hure, alte Betschwester,\"--only here\nyouth has turned out to be much too short. The relieving of the\nperversion by the neurosis in the life of the same person, as well as\nthe above mentioned distribution of perversion and hysteria in different\npersons of the same family, must be placed side by side with the fact\nthat the neurosis is the negative of the perversion.\n*Sublimation.*--The third issue in abnormal constitutional dispositions\nis made possible by the process of \"sublimation,\" through which the\npowerful excitations from individual sources of sexuality are discharged\nand utilized in other spheres, so that a considerable increase of\npsychic capacity results from an, in itself dangerous, predisposition.\nThis forms one the sources of artistic activity, and, according as such\nsublimation is complete or incomplete, the analysis of the character of\nhighly gifted, especially of artistically disposed persons, will show\nany proportionate, blending between productive ability, perversion, and\nneurosis. A sub-species of sublimation is the suppression through\n_reaction-formation_, which, as we have found, begins even in the\nlatency period of infancy, only to continue throughout life in\nfavorable cases. What we call the _character_ of a person is built up to\na great extent from the material of sexual excitations; it is composed\nof impulses fixed since infancy and won through sublimation, and of such\nconstructions as are destined to suppress effectually those perverse\nfeelings which are recognized as useless. The general perverse sexual\ndisposition of childhood can therefore be esteemed as a source of a\nnumber of our virtues, insofar as it incites their creation through the\nformation of reactions.[14]\n*Accidental Experiences.*--All other influences lose in significance\nwhen compared with the sexual discharges, shifts of repressions, and\nsublimations; the inner determinations for the last two processes are\ntotally unknown to us. He who includes repressions and sublimations\namong constitutional predispositions, and considers them as the living\nmanifestations of the same, has surely the right to maintain that the\nfinal structure of the sexual life is above all the result of the\ncongenital constitution. No intelligent person, however, will dispute\nthat in such a co\u00f6peration of factors there is also room for the\nmodifying influences of occasional factors derived from experience in\nchildhood and later on.\nIt is not easy to estimate the effectiveness of the constitutional and\nof the occasional factors in their relation to each other. Theory is\nalways inclined to overestimate the first while therapeutic practice\nrenders prominent the significance of the latter. By no means should it\nbe forgotten that between the two there exists a relation of co\u00f6peration\nand not of exclusion. The constitutional factor must wait for\nexperiences which bring it to the surface, while the occasional needs\nthe support of the constitutional factor in order to become effective.\nFor the majority of cases one can imagine a so-called \"etiological\ngroup\" in which the declining intensities of one factor become balanced\nby the rise in the others, but there is no reason to deny the existence\nof extremes at the ends of the group.\nIt would be still more in harmony with psychoanalytic investigation if\nthe experiences of early childhood would get a place of preference among\nthe occasional factors. The one etiological group then becomes split up\ninto two which may be designated as the dispositional and the definitive\ngroups. Constitution and occasional infantile experiences are just as\nco\u00f6perative in the first as disposition and later traumatic experiences\nin the second group. All the factors which injure the sexual development\nshow their effect in that they produce a _regression_, or a return to a\nformer phase of development.\nWe may now continue with our task of enumerating the factors which have\nbecome known to us as influential for the sexual development, whether\nthey be active forces or merely manifestations of the same.\n*Prematurity.*--Such a factor is the spontaneous sexual _prematurity_\nwhich can be definitely demonstrated at least in the etiology of the\nneuroses, though in itself it is as little adequate for causation as the\nother factors. It manifests itself in a breaking through, shortening, or\nsuspending of the infantile latency period and becomes a cause of\ndisturbances inasmuch as it provokes sexual manifestations which, either\non account of the unready state of the sexual inhibitions or because of\nthe undeveloped state of the genital system, can only carry along the\ncharacter of perversions. These tendencies to perversion may either\nremain as such, or after the repression sets in they may become motive\npowers for neurotic symptoms; at all events, the sexual prematurity\nrenders difficult the desirable later control of the sexual impulse by\nthe higher psychic influences, and enhances the compulsive-like\ncharacter which even without this prematurity would be claimed by the\npsychic representatives of the impulse. Sexual prematurity often runs\nparallel with premature intellectual development; it is found as such in\nthe infantile history of the most distinguished and most productive\nindividuals, and in such connection it does not seem to act as\npathogenically as when appearing isolated.\n*Temporal Factors.*--Just like prematurity, other factors, which under\nthe designation of _temporal_ can be added to prematurity, also demand\nconsideration. It seems to be phylogenetically established in what\nsequence the individual impulsive feelings become active, and how long\nthey can manifest themselves before they succumb to the influence of a\nnewly appearing active impulse or to a typical repression. But both in\nthis temporal succession as well as in the duration of the same,\nvariations seem to occur, which must exercise a definite influence on\nthe experience. It cannot be a matter of indifference whether a certain\nstream appears earlier or later than its counterstream, for the effect\nof a repression cannot be made retrogressive; a temporal deviation in\nthe composition of the components regularly produces a change in the\nresult. On the other hand impulsive feelings which appear with special\nintensity often come to a surprisingly rapid end, as in the case of the\nheterosexual attachment of the later manifest homosexuals. The strivings\nof childhood which manifest themselves most impetuously do not justify\nthe fear that they will lastingly dominate the character of the\ngrown-up; one has as much right to expect that they will disappear in\norder to make room for their counterparts. (Harsh masters do not rule\nlong.) To what one may attribute such temporal confusions of the\nprocesses of development we are hardly able to suggest. A view is opened\nhere to a deeper phalanx of biological, and perhaps also historical\nproblems, which we have not yet approached within fighting distance.\n*Adhesion.*--The significance of all premature sexual manifestations is\nenhanced by a psychic factor of unknown origin which at present can be\nput down only as a psychological preliminary. I believe that it is the\n_heightened adhesion_ or _fixedness_ of these impressions of the sexual\nlife which in later neurotics, as well as in perverts, must be added for\nthe completion of the other facts; for the same premature sexual\nmanifestations in other persons cannot impress themselves deeply enough\nto repeat themselves compulsively and to succeed in prescribing the way\nfor the sexual impulse throughout later life. Perhaps a part of the\nexplanation for this adhesion lies in another psychic factor which we\ncannot miss in the causation of the neuroses, namely, in the\npreponderance which in the psychic life falls to the share of memory\ntraces as compared with recent impressions. This factor is apparently\ndependent on the intellectual development and grows with the growth of\npersonal culture. In contrast to this the savage has been characterized\nas \"the unfortunate child of the moment.\"[15] Owing to the oppositional\nrelation existing between culture and the free development of sexuality,\nthe results of which may be traced far into the formation of our life,\nthe problem how the sexual life of the child evolves is of very little\nimportance for the later life in the lower stages of culture and\ncivilization, and of very great importance in the higher.\n*Fixation.*--The influence of the psychic factors just mentioned favored\nthe development of the accidentally experienced impulses of the\ninfantile sexuality. The latter (especially in the form of seductions\nthrough other children or through adults) produce the material which,\nwith the help of the former, may become fixed as a permanent\ndisturbance. A considerable number of the deviations from the normal\nsexual life observed later have been thus established in neurotics and\nperverts from the beginning through the impressions received during the\nalleged sexually free period of childhood. The causation is produced by\nthe responsiveness of the constitution, the prematurity, the quality of\nheightened adhesion, and the accidental excitement of the sexual impulse\nthrough outside influence.\nThe unsatisfactory conclusions which have resulted from this\ninvestigation of the disturbances of the sexual life is due to the fact\nthat we as yet know too little concerning the biological processes in\nwhich the nature of sexuality consists to form from our isolated\nexaminations a satisfactory theory for the explanation of either the\nnormal or the pathological.\n[1] The differences will be emphasized in the schematic representation\ngiven in the text. To what extent the infantile sexuality approaches the\ndefinitive sexual organization through its object selection has been\ndiscussed before (p. 60).\n[2] See my work, Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious, translated by\nA.A. Brill, Moffat Yard Pub. Co., New York: \"The fore-pleasure gained by\nthe technique of wit is utilized for the purpose of setting free a\ngreater pleasure by the removal of inner inhibitions.\"\n[3] Cf. Zur Einf\u00fchrung des Narzismus, Jahrbuch der Psychoanalyse, VI,\n1913.\n[4] It is necessary to make clear that the conceptions \"masculine\" and\n\"feminine,\" whose content seems so unequivocal to the ordinary meaning,\nbelong to the most confused terms in science and can be cut up into at\nleast three paths. One uses masculine and feminine at times in the sense\nof activity and passivity, again, in the biological sense, and then also\nin the sociological sense. The first of these three meanings is the\nessential one and the only one utilizable in psychoanalysis. It agrees\nwith the masculine designation of the libido in the text above, for the\nlibido is always active even when it is directed to a passive aim. The\nsecond, the biological significance of masculine and feminine, is the\none which permits the clearest determination. Masculine and feminine are\nhere characterized by the presence of semen or ovum and through the\nfunctions emanating from them. The activity and its secondary\nmanifestations, like stronger developed muscles, aggression, a greater\nintensity of libido, are as a rule soldered to the biological\nmasculinity but not necessarily connected with it, for there are species\nof animals in whom these qualities are attributed to the female. The\nthird, the sociological meaning, receives its content through the\nobservation of the actual existing male and female individuals. The\nresult of this in man is that there is no pure masculinity or feminity\neither in the biological or psychological sense. On the contrary every\nindividual person shows a mixture of his own biological sex\ncharacteristics with the biological traits of the other sex and a union\nof activity and passivity; this is the case whether these psychological\ncharacteristic features depend on the biological or whether they are\nindependent of it.\n[5] Psychoanalysis teaches that there are two paths of object-finding;\nthe first is the one discussed in the text which is guided by the early\ninfantile prototypes. The second is the narcissistic which seeks its own\nego and finds it in the other. The latter is of particularly great\nsignificance for the pathological outcomes, but does not fit into the\nconnection treated here.\n[6] Those to whom this conception appears \"wicked\" may read Havelock\nEllis's treatise on the relations between mother and child which\nexpresses almost the same ideas (The Sexual Impulse, p. 16).\n[7] For the explanation of the origin of the infantile fear I am\nindebted to a three-year-old boy whom I once heard calling from a dark\nroom: \"Aunt, talk to me, I am afraid because it is dark.\" \"How will that\nhelp you,\" answered the aunt; \"you cannot see anyhow.\" \"That's nothing,\"\nanswered the child; \"if some one talks then it becomes light.\"--He was,\nas we see, not afraid of the darkness but he was afraid because he\nmissed the person he loved, and he could promise to calm down as soon as\nhe was assured of her presence.\n[8] Cf. here what was said on page 83 concerning the object selection of\nthe child; the \"tender stream.\"\n[9] The incest barrier probably belongs to the historical acquisitions\nof humanity and like other moral taboos it must be fixed in many\nindividuals through organic heredity. (Cf. my work, Totem and Taboo,\n1913.) Psychoanalytic studies show, however, how intensively the\nindividual struggles with the incest temptations during his development\nand how frequently he puts them into phantasies and even into reality.\n[10] Compare the description concerning the inevitable relation in the\nOedipus legend (The Interpretation of Dreams, p. 222, translated by A.A.\nBrill, The Macmillan Co., New York, and Allen & Unwin, London).\n[11] Innumerable peculiarities of the human love-life as well as the\ncompulsiveness of being in love itself can surely only be understood\nthrough a reference to childhood or as an effective remnant of the same.\n[12] This was true not only of the \"negative\" tendencies to perversion\nappearing in the neurosis, but also of the so-called positive\nperversions. The latter are not only to be attributed to the fixation of\nthe infantile tendencies, but also to regression to these tendencies\nowing to the misplacement of other paths of the sexual stream. Hence the\npositive perversions are also accessible to psychoanalytic therapy. (Cf.\nthe works of Sadger, Ferenczi, and Brill.)\n[13] Here one often sees that at first a normal sexual stream begins at\nthe age of puberty, but owing to its inner weakness it breaks down at\nthe first outer hindrance and then changes from regression, to perverse\nfixation.\n[14] That keen observer of human nature, E. Zola, describes a girl in\nhis book, La Joie de vivre, who in cheerful self renunciation offers all\nshe has in possession or expectation, her fortune and her life's hopes\nto those she loves without thought of return. The childhood of this girl\nwas dominated by an insatiable desire for love which whenever she was\ndepreciated caused her to merge into a fit of cruelty.\n[15] It is possible that the heightened adhesion is only the result of a\nspecial intensive somatic sexual manifestation of former years.\nINDEX\nAberrations (see Perversions)\na fragment of inhibited development, 89\nSexual, 1, 13,

By discarding the old methods of treatment\nand strictly applying himself to a study of the patient\u2019s life he\ndiscovered that the hitherto puzzling symptoms had a definite meaning,\nand that there was nothing arbitrary in any morbid manifestation.\nPsychoanalysis always showed that they referred to some definite\nproblem or conflict of the person concerned. It was while tracing back\nthe abnormal to the normal state that Professor Freud found how faint\nthe line of demarcation was between the normal and neurotic person,\nand that the psychopathologic mechanisms so glaringly observed in the\npsychoneuroses and psychoses could usually be demonstrated in a lesser\ndegree in normal persons. This led to a study of the faulty actions\nof everyday life and later to the publication of the _Psychopathology\nof Everyday Life_, a book which passed through four editions in\nGermany and is considered the author\u2019s most popular work. With great\ningenuity and penetration the author throws much light on the complex\nproblems of human behaviour, and clearly demonstrates that the hitherto\nconsidered impassable gap between normal and abnormal mental states is\nmore apparent than real.\nThis translation is made of the fourth German edition, and while the\noriginal text was strictly followed, linguistic difficulties often made\nit necessary to modify or substitute some of the author\u2019s cases by\nexamples comprehensible to the English-speaking reader.\nA.

I have there\nundertaken a psychologic analysis of a common case of temporary\nforgetfulness of proper names, and from a pregnant example of my\nown observation I have reached the conclusion that this frequent\nand practically unimportant occurrence of a failure of a psychic\nfunction--of memory--admits an explanation which goes beyond the\ncustomary utilization of this phenomenon.\nIf an average psychologist should be asked to explain how it happens\nthat we often fail to recall a name which we are sure we know, he would\nprobably content himself with the answer that proper names are more\napt to be forgotten than any other content of memory. He might give\nplausible reasons for this \u201cforgetting preference\u201d for proper names,\nbut he would not assume any deep determinant for the process.\nI was led to examine exhaustively the phenomenon of temporary\nforgetfulness through the observation of certain peculiarities,\nwhich, although not general, can, nevertheless, be seen clearly in\nsome cases. In these there is not only _forgetfulness_, but also\nfalse _recollection_: he who strives for the escaped name brings to\nconsciousness others--substitutive names--which, although immediately\nrecognized as false, nevertheless obtrude themselves with great\ntenacity. The process which should lead to the reproduction of the lost\nname is, as it were, displaced, and thus brings one to an incorrect\nsubstitute.\nNow it is my assumption that the displacement is not left to psychic\narbitrariness, but that it follows lawful and rational paths. In other\nwords, I assume that the substitutive name (or names) stands in direct\nrelation to the lost name, and I hope, if I succeed in demonstrating\nthis connection, to throw light on the origin of the forgetting of\nnames.\nIn the example which I selected for analysis in 1898 I vainly strove\nto recall the name of the master who made the imposing frescoes of\nthe \u201cLast Judgment\u201d in the dome of _Orvieto_. Instead of the lost\nname--_Signorelli_--two other names of artists--_Botticelli_ and\n_Boltraffio_--obtruded themselves, names which my judgment immediately\nand definitely rejected as being incorrect. When the correct name was\nimparted to me by an outsider I recognized it at once without any\nhesitation. The examination of the influence and association paths\nwhich caused the displacement from _Signorelli_ to _Botticelli_ and\n_Boltraffio_ led to the following results:--\n(_a_) The reason for the escape of the name _Signorelli_ is neither\nto be sought in the strangeness in itself of this name nor in the\npsychologic character of the connection in which it was inserted. The\nforgotten name was just as familiar to me as one of the substitutive\nnames--Botticelli--and somewhat more familiar than the other\nsubstitute--Boltraffio--of the possessor of which I could hardly say\nmore than that he belonged to the Milanese School. The connection,\ntoo, in which the forgetting of the name took place appeared to me\nharmless, and led to no further explanation. I journeyed by carriage\nwith a stranger from Ragusa, Dalmatia, to a station in Herzegovina. Our\nconversation drifted to travelling in Italy, and I asked my companion\nwhether he had been in Orvieto and had seen there the famous frescoes\nof----\n(_b_) The forgetting of the name could not be explained until after I\nhad recalled the theme discussed immediately before this conversation.\nThis forgetting then made itself known _as a disturbance of the\nnewly emerging theme caused by the theme preceding it_. In brief,\nbefore I asked my travelling companion if he had been in Orvieto we\nhad been discussing the customs of the Turks living in _Bosnia_ and\n_Herzegovina_. I had related what I heard from a colleague who was\npractising medicine among them, namely, that they show full confidence\nin the physician and complete submission to fate. When one is compelled\nto inform them that there is no help for the patient, they answer:\n\u201c_Sir_ (Herr), what can I say? I know that if he could be saved you\nwould save him.\u201d In these sentences alone we can find the words and\nnames: _Bosnia_, _Herzegovina_, and _Herr_ (sir), which may be inserted\nin an association series between _Signorelli_, _Botticelli_, and\n_Boltraffio_.\n(_c_) I assume that the stream of thoughts concerning the customs\nof the Turks in Bosnia, etc., was able to disturb the next thought,\nbecause I withdrew my attention from it before it came to an end. For\nI recalled that I wished to relate a second anecdote which was next to\nthe first in my memory. These Turks value the sexual pleasure above\nall else, and at sexual disturbances merge into an utter despair which\nstrangely contrasts with their resignation at the peril of losing their\nlives. One of my colleague\u2019s patients once told him: \u201cFor you know, sir\n(Herr), if that ceases, life no longer has any charm.\u201d\nI refrained from imparting this characteristic feature because I did\nnot wish to touch upon such a delicate theme in conversation with a\nstranger. But I went still further; I also deflected my attention from\nthe continuation of the thought which might have associated itself in\nme with the theme \u201cDeath and Sexuality.\u201d I was at that time under the\nafter-effects of a message which I had received a few weeks before,\nduring a brief sojourn in _Trafoi_. A patient on whom I had spent\nmuch effort had ended his life on account of an incurable sexual\ndisturbance. I know positively that this sad event, and everything\nconnected with it, did not come to my conscious recollection on that\ntrip in Herzegovina. However, the agreement between _Trafoi_ and\n_Boltraffio_ forces me to assume that this reminiscence was at that\ntime brought to activity despite all the intentional deviation of my\nattention.\n(_d_) I can no longer conceive the forgetting of the name Signorelli\nas an accidental occurrence. I must recognize in this process the\ninfluence of a _motive_. There were motives which actuated the\ninterruption in the communication of my thoughts (concerning the\ncustoms of the Turks, etc.), and which later influenced me to exclude\nfrom my consciousness the thought connected with them, and which might\nhave led to the message concerning the incident in Trafoi--that is,\nI wanted to forget something, I _repressed_ something. To be sure,\nI wished to forget something other than the name of the master of\nOrvieto; but this other thought brought about an associative connection\nbetween itself and this name, so that my act of volition missed the\naim, and I _forgot the one against my will_, while I _intentionally_\nwished to forget the other. The disinclination to recall directed\nitself against the one content; the inability to remember appeared\nin another. The case would have been obviously simpler if this\ndisinclination and the inability to remember had concerned the same\ncontent. The substitutive names no longer seem so thoroughly justified\nas they were before this explanation. They remind me (after the form of\na compromise) as much of what I wished to forget as of what I wished to\nremember, and show me that my object to forget something was neither a\nperfect success nor a failure.\n(_e_) The nature of the association formed between the lost name and\nthe repressed theme (death and sexuality, etc.), containing the names\nof Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Trafoi, is also very strange. In the scheme\ninserted here, which originally appeared in 1898, an attempt is made to\ngraphically represent these associations.\n[Illustration:\n+------+                                             /-----\\\n|Signor| _elli_           (Bo) tic_elli_      (Bo) l traffio\n+------+                    |                 /      \\--|--/\n|   |                       |                /          |\n|   |                       |    /----------/           |\n|   |                       |   /                       |\n| +---+                     |--/                        |\n| |Her| zegovina and       (Bo) snia                    |\n| +---+                                                 |\n+----+                                                  |\n|Herr| Sir, What can I say, etc.                        |\n+----+       \\                                          |\n\\                                      /--|--\\\nDeath and Sexuality                      Trafoi\n\\                                    \\-----/\n\\                                     /\nRepressed thoughts------------------/\n]\nThe name Signorelli was thus divided into two parts. One pair of\nsyllables (_elli_) returned unchanged in one of the substitutions,\nwhile the other had gained, through the translation of _signor_\n(sir, Herr), many and diverse relations to the name contained in the\nrepressed theme, but was lost through it in the reproduction. Its\nsubstitution was formed in a way to suggest that a displacement took\nplace along the same associations--\u201cHerzegovina and Bosnia\u201d--regardless\nof the sense and acoustic demarcation. The names were therefore treated\nin this process like the written pictures of a sentence which is to be\ntransformed into a picture-puzzle (rebus). No information was given\nto consciousness concerning the whole process, which, instead of the\nname Signorelli, was thus changed to the substitutive names. At first\nsight no relation is apparent between the theme that contained the name\nSignorelli and the repressed one which immediately preceded it.\nPerhaps it is not superfluous to remark that the given explanation does\nnot contradict the conditions of memory reproduction and forgetting\nassumed by other psychologists, which they seek in certain relations\nand dispositions. Only in certain cases have we added another _motive_\nto the factors long recognized as causative in forgetting names,\nand have thus laid bare the mechanism of faulty memory. The assumed\ndispositions are indispensable also in our case, in order to make it\npossible for the repressed element to associatively gain control\nover the desired name and take it along into the repression. Perhaps\nthis would not have occurred in another name having more favourable\nconditions of reproduction. For it is quite probable that a suppressed\nelement continually strives to assert itself in some other way, but\nattains this success only where it meets with suitable conditions. At\nother times the suppression succeeds without disturbance of function,\nor, as we may justly say, without symptoms.\nWhen we recapitulate the conditions for forgetting a name with faulty\nrecollection we find: (1) a certain disposition to forget the same;\n(2) a process of suppression which has taken place shortly before;\nand (3) the possibility of establishing an _outer_ association\nbetween the concerned name and the element previously suppressed. The\nlast condition will probably not have to be much overrated, for the\nslightest claim on the association is apt in most cases to bring it\nabout. But it is a different and farther-reaching question whether such\nouter association can really furnish the proper condition to enable\nthe suppressed element to disturb the reproduction of the desired\nname, or whether after all a more intimate connection between the two\nthemes is not necessarily required. On superficial consideration one\nmay be willing to reject the latter requirement and consider the\ntemporal meeting in perfectly dissimilar contents as sufficient. But\non more thorough examination one finds more and more frequently that\nthe two elements (the repressed and the new one) connected by an outer\nassociation, possess besides a connection in content, and this can also\nbe demonstrated in the example _Signorelli_.\nThe value of the understanding gained through the analysis of the\nexample _Signorelli_ naturally depends on whether we must explain this\ncase as a typical or as an isolated process. I must now maintain that\nthe forgetting of a name associated with faulty recollection uncommonly\noften follows the same process as was demonstrated in the case of\n_Signorelli_. Almost every time that I observed this phenomenon in\nmyself I was able to explain it in the manner indicated above as being\nmotivated by repression.\nI must mention still another view-point in favour of the typical nature\nof our analysis. I believe that one is not justified in separating\nthe cases of name-forgetting with faulty recollection from those in\nwhich incorrect substitutive names have not obtruded themselves. These\nsubstitutive names occur spontaneously in a number of cases; in other\ncases, where they do not come spontaneously, they can be brought to\nthe surface by concentration of attention, and they then show the same\nrelation to the repressed element and the lost name as those that\ncome spontaneously. Two factors seem to play a part in bringing to\nconsciousness the substitutive names: first, the effort of attention,\nand second, an inner determinant which adheres to the psychic material.\nI could find the latter in the greater or lesser facility which forms\nthe required outer associations between the two elements. A great many\nof the cases of name-forgetting without faulty recollection therefore\nbelong to the cases with substitutive name formation, the mechanism\nof which corresponds to the one in the example _Signorelli_. But I\nsurely shall not venture to assert that all cases of name-forgetting\nbelong to the same group. There is no doubt that there are cases of\nname-forgetting that proceed in a much simpler way. We shall represent\nthis state of affairs carefully enough if we assert that _besides the\nsimple forgetting of proper names there is another forgetting which is\nmotivated by repression_.\nII\nFORGETTING OF FOREIGN WORDS\nThe ordinary vocabulary of our own language seems to be protected\nagainst forgetting within the limits of normal function, but it is\nquite different with words from a foreign language. The tendency\nto forget such words extends to all parts of speech. In fact,\ndepending on our own general state and the degree of fatigue, the\nfirst manifestation of functional disturbance evinces itself in the\nirregularity of our control over foreign vocabulary. In a series\nof cases this forgetting follows the same mechanism as the one\nrevealed in the example _Signorelli_. As a demonstration of this I\nshall report a single analysis, characterized, however, by valuable\nfeatures, concerning the forgetting of a word, not a noun, from a Latin\nquotation. Before proceeding, allow me to give a full and clear account\nof this little episode.\nLast summer, while journeying on my vacation, I renewed the\nacquaintance of a young man of academic education, who, as I soon\nnoticed, was conversant with some of my works. In our conversation we\ndrifted--I no longer remember how--to the social position of the race\nto which we both belonged. He, being ambitious, bemoaned the fact that\nhis generation, as he expressed it, was destined to grow crippled, that\nit was prevented from developing its talents and from gratifying its\ndesires. He concluded his passionately felt speech with the familiar\nverse from Virgil: _Exoriare_ ... in which the unhappy _Dido_ leaves\nher vengeance upon _\u00c6neas_ to posterity. Instead of \u201cconcluded,\u201d I\nshould have said \u201cwished to conclude,\u201d for he could not bring the\nquotation to an end, and attempted to conceal the open gap in his\nmemory by transposing the words:--\n\u201c_Exoriar(e) ex nostris ossibus ultor!_\u201d\nHe finally became piqued and said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t make such a mocking\nface, as if you were gloating over my embarrassment, but help me. There\nis something missing in this verse. How does it read in its complete\nform?\u201d\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d I answered, and cited it correctly:--\n\u201c_Exoriar(e) aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor!_\u201d\n\u201cIt is too stupid to forget such a word,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way, I\nunderstand you claim that forgetting is not without its reasons; I\nshould be very curious to find out how I came to forget this indefinite\npronoun \u2018_aliquis_.\u2019\u201d\nI gladly accepted the challenge, as I hoped to get an addition to\nmy collection, and said, \u201cWe can easily do this, but I must ask you\nto tell me frankly and without any criticism everything that occurs\nto your mind after you focus your attention, without any particular\nintention, on the forgotten word.\u201d[2]\n\u201cVery well, the ridiculous idea comes to me to divide the word in the\nfollowing way: _a_ and _liquis_.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else does that recall to you?\u201d\n\u201cThe thought goes on to _reliques_--_liquidation_--_liquidity_--_fluid_.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean anything to you now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not by a long shot.\u201d\n\u201cJust go ahead.\u201d\n\u201cI now think,\u201d he said, laughing sarcastically, \u201cof Simon of Trent,\nwhose relics I saw two years ago in a church in Trent. I think of the\nold accusation which has been brought against the Jews again, and\nof the work of _Kleinpaul_, who sees in these supposed sacrifices\nreincarnations or revivals, so to speak, of the Saviour.\u201d\n\u201cThis stream of thoughts has some connection with the theme which we\ndiscussed before the Latin word escaped you.\u201d\n\u201cYou are right. I now think of an article in an Italian journal which I\nhave recently read. I believe it was entitled: \u2018What St. Augustine said\nConcerning Women.\u2019 What can you do with this?\u201d\nI waited.\n\u201cNow I think of something which surely has no connection with the\ntheme.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please abstain from all criticism, and----\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know! I recall a handsome old gentleman whom I met on my journey\nlast week. He was really an _original_ type. He looked like a big bird\nof prey. His name, if you care to know, is Benedict.\u201d\n\u201cWell, at least you give a grouping of saints and Church fathers: _St.\nSimon_, _St. Augustine_, and _St. Benedict_. I believe that there was a\nChurch father named _Origines_. Three of these, moreover, are Christian\nnames, like _Paul_ in the name _Kleinpaul_.\u201d\n\u201cNow I think of _St. Januarius_ and his blood miracle--I find that the\nthoughts are running mechanically.\u201d\n\u201cJust stop a moment; both _St. Januarius_ and _St. Augustine_ have\nsomething to do with the calendar. Will you recall to me the blood\nmiracle?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know about it? The blood of St. Januarius is preserved in\na phial in a church in Naples, and on a certain holiday a miracle\ntakes place causing it to liquefy. The people think a great deal of\nthis miracle, and become very excited if the liquefying process is\nretarded, as happened once during the French occupation. The General\nin command--or Garibaldi, if I am not mistaken--then took the priest\naside, and with a very significant gesture pointed out to him the\nsoldiers arrayed without, and expressed his hope that the miracle would\nsoon take place. And it actually took place....\u201d\n\u201cWell, what else comes to your mind? Why do you hesitate?\u201d\n\u201cSomething really occurred to me ... but it is too intimate a matter to\nimpart ... besides, I see no connection and no necessity for telling\nit.\u201d\n\u201cI will take care of the connection. Of course I cannot compel you\nto reveal what is disagreeable to you, but then you should not have\ndemanded that I tell you why you forgot the word \u2018_aliquis_.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cReally? Do you think so? Well, I suddenly thought of a woman from whom\nI could easily get a message that would be very annoying to us both.\u201d\n\u201cThat she missed her courses?\u201d\n\u201cHow could you guess such a thing?\u201d\n\u201cThat was not very difficult. You prepared me for it long enough. Just\nthink of the _saints of the calendar, the liquefying of the blood on a\ncertain day, the excitement if the event does not take place, and the\ndistinct threat that the miracle must take place_.... Indeed, you have\nelaborated the miracle of St. Januarius into a clever allusion to the\ncourses of the woman.\u201d\n\u201cIt was surely without my knowledge. And do you really believe that my\ninability to reproduce the word \u2018_aliquis_\u2019 was due to this anxious\nexpectation?\u201d\n\u201cThat appears to me absolutely certain. Don\u2019t you recall dividing\nit into _a-liquis_ and the associations: _reliques_, _liquidation_,\n_fluid_? Shall I also add to this connection the fact that St. Simon,\nto whom you got by way of the _reliques_, was sacrificed as a child?\u201d\n\u201cPlease stop. I hope you do not take these thoughts--if I really\nentertained them--seriously. I will, however, confess to you that the\nlady is Italian, and that I visited Naples in her company. But may not\nall this be coincidental?\u201d\n\u201cI must leave to your own judgment whether you can explain all these\nconnections through the assumption of coincidence. I will tell you,\nhowever, that every similar case that you analyse will lead you to just\nsuch remarkable \u2018coincidences!\u2019\u201d\nI have more than one reason for valuing this little analysis, for\nwhich I am indebted to my travelling companion. First, because in\nthis case I was able to make use of a source which is otherwise\ninaccessible to me. Most of the examples of psychic disturbances\nof daily life that I have here compiled I was obliged to take from\nobservation of myself. I endeavoured to evade the far richer material\nfurnished me by my neurotic patients, because I had to preclude the\nobjection that the phenomena in question were only the result and\nmanifestation of the neurosis. It was therefore of special value for\nmy purpose to have a stranger free from a neurosis offer himself as\na subject for such examination. This analysis is also important in\nother respects, inasmuch as it elucidates a case of word-forgetting\n_without_ substitutive recollection, and thus confirms the principle\nformulated above, namely, that the appearance or nonappearance of\nincorrect substitutive recollections does not constitute an essential\ndistinction[3].\nBut the principal value of the example _aliquis_ lies in another of\nits distinctions from the case _Signorelli_. In the latter example the\nreproduction of the name becomes disturbed through the after-effects of\na stream of thought which began shortly before and was interrupted, but\nwhose content had no distinct relation to the new theme which contained\nthe name Signorelli. Between the repression and the theme of the\nforgotten name there existed only the relation of temporal contiguity,\nwhich reached the other in order that the two should be able to form\na connection through an outer association.[4] On the other hand, in\nthe example _aliquis_ one can note no trace of such an independent\nrepressed theme which could occupy conscious thought immediately before\nand then re-echo as a disturbance. The disturbance of the reproduction\nproceeded here from the inner part of the theme touched upon, and was\nbrought about by the fact that unconsciously a contradiction arose\nagainst the wish-idea represented in the quotation.\nThe origin must be construed in the following manner: The speaker\ndeplored the fact that the present generation of his people was being\ndeprived of its rights, and like Dido he presaged that a new generation\nwould take upon itself vengeance against the oppressors. He therefore\nexpressed the wish for posterity. In this moment he was interrupted by\nthe contradictory thought: \u201cDo you really wish so much for posterity?\nThat is not true. Just think in what a predicament you would be if you\nshould now receive the information that you must expect posterity from\nthe quarter you have in mind! No, you want no posterity--as much as you\nneed it for your vengeance.\u201d This contradiction asserts itself, just\nas in the example _Signorelli_, by forming an outer association between\none of his ideation elements and an element of the repressed wish, but\nhere it is brought about in a most strained manner through what seems\nan artificial detour of associations. Another important agreement with\nthe example _Signorelli_ results from the fact that the contradiction\noriginates from repressed sources and emanates from thoughts which\nwould cause a deviation of attention.\nSo much for the diversity and the inner relationship of both paradigms\nof the forgetting of names. We have learned to know a second mechanism\nof forgetting, namely, the disturbance of thought through an inner\ncontradiction emanating from the repression. In the course of this\ndiscussion we shall repeatedly meet with this process, which seems to\nme to be the more easily understood.\nIII\nFORGETTING OF NAMES AND ORDER OF WORDS\nExperiences like those mentioned concerning the process of forgetting\na part of the order of words from a foreign language may cause one\nto wonder whether the forgetting of the order of words in one\u2019s own\nlanguage requires an essentially different explanation. To be sure, one\nis not wont to be surprised if after awhile a formula or poem learned\nby heart can only be reproduced imperfectly, with variations and gaps.\nStill, as this forgetting does not affect equally all the things\nlearned together, but seems to pick out therefrom definite parts, it\nmay be worth our effort to investigate analytically some examples of\nsuch faulty reproductions.\nBrill reports the following example:--\n\u201cWhile conversing one day with a very brilliant young woman she had\noccasion to quote from Keats. The poem was entitled \u2018Ode to Apollo,\u2019\nand she recited the following lines:--\n\u201c\u2018In thy western house of gold\nWhere thou livest in thy state,\nBards, that once sublimely told\nProsaic truths that came too late.\u2019\nShe hesitated many times during the recitation, being sure that\nthere was something wrong with the last line. To her great surprise,\non referring to the book she found that not only was the last line\nmisquoted but that there were many other mistakes. The correct lines\nread as follows:--\nODE TO APOLLO\n\u201c\u2018In thy western _halls_ of gold\n_When_ thou _sittest_ in thy state,\nBards, that _erst_ sublimely told\n_Heroic deeds and sang of fate_.\u2019\nThe words italicized are those that have been forgotten and replaced by\nothers during the recitation.\n\u201cShe was astonished at her many mistakes, and attributed them to a\nfailure of memory. I could readily convince her, however, that there\nwas no qualitative or quantitative disturbance of memory in her case,\nand recalled to her our conversation immediately before quoting these\nlines.\n\u201cWe were discussing the over-estimation of personality among lovers,\nand she thought it was Victor Hugo who said that love is the greatest\nthing in the world because it makes an angel or a god out of a grocery\nclerk. She continued: \u2018Only when we are in love have we blind faith\nin humanity; everything is perfect, everything is beautiful, and\n... everything is so poetically unreal. Still, it is a wonderful\nexperience; worth going through, notwithstanding the terrible\ndisappointments that usually follow. It puts us on a level with the\ngods and incites us to all sorts of artistic activities. We become\nreal poets; we not only memorize and quote poetry, but we often become\nApollos ourselves.\u2019 She then quoted the lines given above.\n\u201cWhen I asked on what occasion she memorized the lines she could\nnot recall. As a teacher of elocution she was wont to memorize so\nmuch and so often that it was difficult to tell just when she had\nmemorized these lines. \u2018Judging by the conversation,\u2019 I suggested,\n\u2018it would seem that this poem is intimately associated with the idea\nof over-estimation of personality of one in love. Have you perhaps\nmemorized this poem when you were in such a state?\u2019 She became\nthoughtful for a while and soon recalled the following facts: Twelve\nyears before, when she was eighteen years old, she fell in love.\nShe met the young man while participating in an amateur theatrical\nperformance. He was at the time studying for the stage, and it was\npredicted that some day he would be a matin\u00e9e idol. He was endowed\nwith all the attributes needed for such a calling. He was well built,\nfascinating, impulsive, very clever, and ... very fickle-minded. She\nwas warned against him, but she paid no heed, attributing it all to\nthe envy of her counsellors. Everything went well for a few months,\nwhen she suddenly received word that her Apollo, for whom she had\nmemorized these lines, had eloped with and married a very wealthy young\nwoman. A few years later she heard that he was living in a Western\ncity, where he was taking care of his father-in-law\u2019s interests.\n\u201cThe misquoted lines are now quite plain. The discussion about the\nover-estimation of personality among lovers unconsciously recalled to\nher a disagreeable experience, when she herself over-estimated the\npersonality of the man she loved. She thought he was a god, but he\nturned out to be even worse than the average mortal. The episode could\nnot come to the surface because it was determined by very disagreeable\nand painful thoughts, but the unconscious variations in the poem\nplainly showed her present mental state. The poetic expressions were\nnot only changed to prosaic ones, but they clearly alluded to the whole\nepisode.\u201d\nAnother example of forgetting the order of words of a poem well known\nto the person I shall cite from Dr. C. G. Jung,[5] quoting the words of\nthe author:--\n\u201cA man wished to recite the familiar poem, \u2018A Pine-tree Stands Alone,\u2019\netc. In the line \u2018He felt drowsy\u2019 he became hopelessly stuck at the\nwords \u2018with the white sheet.\u2019 This forgetting of such a well-known\nverse seemed to me rather peculiar, and I therefore asked him to\nreproduce what came to his mind when he thought of the words \u2018with the\nwhite sheet.\u2019 He gave the following series of associations \u2018The white\nsheet makes one think of a white sheet on a corpse--a linen sheet\nwith which one covers a dead body--[pause]--now I think of a near\nfriend--his brother died quite recently--he is supposed to have died\nof heart disease--he was also very corpulent--my friend is corpulent,\ntoo, and I thought that he might meet the same fate--probably he\ndoesn\u2019t exercise enough--when I heard of this death I suddenly became\nfrightened: the same thing might happen to me, as my own family is\npredisposed to obesity--my grandfather died of heart disease--I, also,\nam somewhat too corpulent, and for that reason I began an obesity cure\na few days ago.\u2019\u201d\nJung remarks: \u201cThe man had unconsciously immediately identified himself\nwith the pine-tree which was covered with a white sheet.\u201d\nFor the following example of forgetting the order of words I am\nindebted to my friend Dr. Ferenczi, of Budapest. Unlike the former\nexamples, it does not refer to a verse taken from poetry, but to a\nself-coined saying. It may also demonstrate to us the rather unusual\ncase where the forgetting places itself at the disposal of discretion\nwhen the latter is in danger of yielding to a momentary desire. The\nmistake thus advances to a useful function. After we have sobered down\nwe justify that inner striving which at first could manifest itself\nonly by way of inability, as in forgetting or psychic impotence.\n\u201cAt a social gathering some one quoted, _Tout comprendre c\u2019est tout\npardonner_, to which I remarked that the first part of the sentence\nshould suffice, as \u2018pardoning\u2019 is an exemption which must be left to\nGod and the priest. One of the guests thought this observation very\ngood, which in turn emboldened me to remark--probably to ensure myself\nof the good opinion of the well-disposed critic--that some time ago I\nthought of something still better. But when I was about to repeat this\nclever idea I was unable to recall it. Thereupon I immediately withdrew\nfrom the company and wrote my concealing thoughts. I first recalled\nthe name of the friend who had witnessed the birth of this (desired)\nthought, and of the street in Budapest where it took place, and then\nthe name of another friend, whose name was Max, whom we usually called\nMaxie. That led me to the word \u2018maxim,\u2019 and to the thought that at\nthat time, as in the present case, it was a question of varying a\nwell-known maxim. Strangely enough, I did not recall any maxim but\nthe following sentence: \u2018_God created man in His own image_,\u2019 and its\nchanged conception, \u2018_Man created God in his own image_.\u2019 Immediately I\nrecalled the sought-for recollection.\n\u201cMy friend said to me at that time in Andrassy Street, \u2018_Nothing human\nis foreign to me_.\u2019 To which I remarked, basing it on psychoanalytic\nexperience, \u2018You should go further and acknowledge _that nothing animal\nis foreign to you_.\u2019\n\u201cBut after I had finally found the desired recollection I was even then\nprevented from telling it in this social gathering. The young wife of\nthe friend whom I had reminded of the animality of the unconscious was\nalso among those present, and I was perforce reminded that she was not\nat all prepared for the reception of such unsympathetic views. The\nforgetting spared me a number of unpleasant questions from her and a\nhopeless discussion, and just that must have been the motive of the\n\u2018temporary amnesia.\u2019\n\u201cIt is interesting to note that as a concealing thought there emerged a\nsentence in which the deity is degraded to a human invention, while in\nthe sought-for sentence there was an allusion to the animal in the man.\nThe _capitis diminutio_ is therefore common to both. The whole matter\nwas apparently only a continuation of the stream of thought concerning\nunderstanding and forgiving which was stimulated by the discussion.\n\u201cThat the desired thought so rapidly appeared may be also due to the\nfact that I withdrew into a vacant room, away from the society in which\nit was censored.\u201d\nI have since then analysed a large number of cases of forgetting\nor faulty reproduction of the order of words, and the consistent\nresult of these investigations led me to assume that the mechanisms\nof forgetting, as demonstrated in the examples \u201c_aliquis_\u201d and \u201c_Ode\nto Apollo_,\u201d are almost of universal validity. It is not always very\nconvenient to report such analyses, for, just as those cited, they\nusually lead to intimate and painful things in the person analysed; I\nshall therefore add no more to the number of such examples. What is\ncommon to all these cases, regardless of the material, is the fact that\nthe forgotten or distorted material becomes connected through some\nassociative road with an unconscious stream of thought, which gives\nrise to the influence that comes to light as forgetting.\nI am now returning to the forgetting of names, concerning which we\nhave so far considered exhaustively neither the casuistic elements nor\nthe motives. As this form of faulty acts can at times be abundantly\nobserved in myself, I am not at a loss for examples. The slight\nattacks of migraine, from which I am still suffering, are wont to\nannounce themselves hours before through the forgetting of names, and\nat the height of the attack, during which I am not forced, however, to\ngive up my work, I am often unable to recall all proper names.\nStill, just such cases as mine may furnish the cause for a strong\nobjection to our analytic efforts. Should not one be forced to conclude\nfrom such observations that the causation of the forgetfulness,\nespecially the forgetting of names, is to be sought in circulatory or\nfunctional disturbances of the brain, and spare himself the trouble of\nsearching for psychologic explanations for these phenomena? Not at all;\nthat would mean to interchange the mechanism of a process, which is the\nsame in all cases, with its variations. But instead of an analysis I\nshall cite a comparison which will settle the argument.\nLet us assume that I was so reckless as to take a walk at night in an\nuninhabited neighbourhood of a big city, and was attacked and robbed\nof my watch and purse. At the nearest police-station I report the\nmatter in the following words: \u201cI was in this or that street, and was\nthere robbed of my watch and purse by _lonesomeness_ and _darkness_.\u201d\nAlthough these words would not express anything that is incorrect,\nI would, nevertheless, run the danger of being considered--judging\nfrom the wording of this report--as not quite right in the head. To\nbe correct, the state of affairs could only be described by saying\nthat, _favoured_ by the lonesomeness of the place and under _cover_ of\ndarkness, I was robbed of my valuables by _unknown malefactors_.\nNow, then, the state of affairs in forgetting names need not be\ndifferent. Favoured by exhaustion, circulatory disturbances, and\nintoxication, I am robbed by an unknown psychic force of the disposal\nover the proper names belonging to my memory; it is the same force\nwhich in other cases may bring about the same failure of memory during\nperfect health and mental capacity.\nWhen I analyse those cases of name-forgetting occurring in myself, I\nfind almost regularly that the name withheld shows some relation to a\ntheme which concerns my own person, and is apt to provoke in me strong\nand often painful emotions. Following the convenient and commendable\npractice of the Zurich School (Bleuler, Jung, Riklin), I might express\nthe same thing in the following form: The name withheld has touched\na \u201cpersonal complex\u201d in me. The relation of the name to my person is\nan unexpected one, and is mostly brought about through superficial\nassociations (words of double meaning and of similar sounds); it may\ngenerally be designated as a side association. A few simple examples\nwill best illustrate the nature of the same:--\n(_a_) A patient requested me to recommend to him a sanatorium in the\nRiviera. I knew of such a place very near Genoa, I also recalled the\nname of the German colleague who was in charge of the place, but the\nplace itself I could not name, well as I believed I knew it. There was\nnothing left to do but ask the patient to wait, and to appeal quickly\nto the women of the family.\n\u201cJust what is the name of the place near Genoa where Dr. X. has his\nsmall institution in which Mrs. So-and-so remained so long under\ntreatment?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you would forget a name of that sort. The name is Nervi.\u201d\nTo be sure, I have enough to do with nerves.\n(_b_) Another patient spoke about a neighbouring summer resort, and\nmaintained that besides the two familiar inns there was a third. I\ndisputed the existence of any third inn, and referred to the fact that\nI had spent seven summers in the vicinity and therefore knew more about\nthe place than he. Instigated by my contradiction, he recalled the\nname. The name of the third inn was \u201cThe Hochwartner.\u201d Of course, I had\nto admit it; indeed, I was forced to confess that for seven summers\nI had lived near this very inn whose existence I had so strenuously\ndenied. But why should I have forgotten the name and the object? I\nbelieve because the name sounded very much like that of a Vienna\ncolleague who practised the same specialty as my own. It touched in me\nthe \u201cprofessional complex.\u201d\n(_c_) On another occasion, when about to buy a railroad ticket on the\nReichenhall Station, I could not recall the very familiar name of the\nnext big railroad station which I had so often passed. I was forced\nto look it up in the time-table. The name was Rosehome (Rosenheim). I\nsoon discovered through what associations I lost it. An hour earlier I\nhad visited my sister in her home near Reichenhall; my sister\u2019s name\nis Rose, hence also a Rosehome. This name was taken away by my \u201cfamily\ncomplex.\u201d\n(_d_) This predatory influence of the \u201cfamily complex\u201d I can\ndemonstrate in a whole series of complexes.\nOne day I was consulted by a young man, a younger brother of one of my\nfemale patients, whom I saw any number of times, and whom I used to\ncall by his first name. Later, while wishing to talk about his visit, I\nforgot his first name, in no way an unusual one, and could not recall\nit in any way. I walked into the street to read the business signs and\nrecognized the name as soon as it met my eyes.\nThe analysis showed that I had formed a parallel between the visitor\nand my own brother which centred in the question: \u201cWould my brother,\nin a similar case, have behaved like him or even more contrarily?\u201d The\nouter connection between the thoughts concerning the stranger and my\nown family was rendered possible through the accident that the name\nof the mothers in each case was the same, Amelia. Subsequently I also\nunderstood the substitutive names, Daniel and Frank, which obtruded\nthemselves without any explanation. These names, as well as Amelia,\nbelong to Schiller\u2019s play _The Robbers_; they are all connected with a\njoke of the Vienna pedestrian, Daniel Spitzer.\n(_e_) On another occasion I was unable to find a patient\u2019s name\nwhich had a certain reference to my early life. The analysis had to\nbe followed over a long devious road before the desired name was\ndiscovered. The patient expressed his apprehension lest he should\nlose his eyesight; this recalled a young man who became blind from a\ngunshot, and this again led to a picture of another youth who shot\nhimself, and the latter bore the same name as my first patient, though\nnot at all related to him. The name became known to me, however, only\nafter the anxious apprehension from these two juvenile cases was\ntransferred to a person of my own family.\nThus an incessant stream of \u201cself-reference\u201d flows through my thoughts\nconcerning which I usually have no inkling, but which betrays itself\nthrough such name-forgetting. It seems as if I were forced to compare\nwith my own person all that I hear about strangers, as if my personal\ncomplexes became stirred up at every information from others. It seems\nimpossible that this should be an individual peculiarity of my own\nperson; it must, on the contrary, point to the way we grasp outside\nmatters in general. I have reasons to assume that other individuals\nmeet with experiences quite similar to mine.\nThe best example of this kind was reported to me by a gentleman named\nLederer as a personal experience. While on his wedding trip in Venice\nhe came across a man with whom he was but slightly acquainted, and\nwhom he was obliged to introduce to his wife. As he forgot the name of\nthe stranger he got himself out of the embarrassment the first time\nby mumbling the name unintelligibly. But when he met the man a second\ntime, as is inevitable in Venice, he took him aside and begged him\nto help him out of the difficulty by telling him his name, which he\nunfortunately had forgotten. The answer of the stranger pointed to a\nsuperior knowledge of human nature: \u201cI readily believe that you did not\ngrasp my name. My name is like yours--Lederer!\u201d\nOne cannot suppress a slight feeling of unpleasantness on discovering\nhis own name in a stranger. I had recently felt it very plainly when I\nwas consulted during my office hours by a man named S. Freud. However,\nI am assured by one of my own critics that in this respect he behaves\nin quite the opposite manner.\n(_f_) The effect of personal relation can be recognized also in the\nfollowing examples reported by Jung.[6]\n\u201cMr. Y. falls in love with a lady who soon thereafter marries Mr. X. In\nspite of the fact that Mr. Y. was an old acquaintance of Mr. X., and\nhad business relations with him, he repeatedly forgot the name, and\non a number of occasions, when wishing to correspond with X., he was\nobliged to ask other people for his name.\u201d\nHowever, the motivation for the forgetting is more evident in this case\nthan in the preceding ones, which were under the constellation of the\npersonal reference. Here the forgetting is manifestly a direct result\nof the dislike of Y. for the happy rival; he does not wish to know\nanything about him.\n(_g_) The following case, reported by Ferenczi, the analysis of which\nis especially instructive through the explanation of the substitutive\nthoughts (like _Botticelli-Boltraffio_ to _Signorelli_), shows in a\nsomewhat different way how self-reference leads to the forgetting of a\nname:--\n\u201cA lady who heard something about psychoanalysis could not recall the\nname of the psychiatrist, Young (Jung).\n\u201cInstead, the following names occurred to her: Kl. (a\nname)--Wilde--Nietzsche--Hauptmann.\n\u201cI did not tell her the name, and requested her to repeat her free\nassociations to every thought.\n\u201cTo Kl. she at once thought of Mrs. Kl., that she was an embellished\nand affected person who looked very well for her age. \u2018She does not\nage.\u2019 As a general and principal conception of Wilde and Nietzsche, she\ngave the association \u2018mental disease.\u2019 She then added jocosely: \u2018The\nFreudians will continue looking for the causes of mental diseases until\nthey themselves become insane.\u2019 She continued: \u2018I cannot bear Wilde\nand Nietzsche. I do not understand them. I hear that they were both\nhomosexual. Wilde has occupied himself with _young_ people\u2019 (although\nshe uttered in this sentence the correct name she still could not\nremember it).\n\u201cTo Hauptmann she associated the words _half_ and _youth_, and only\nafter I called her attention to the word _youth_ did she become aware\nthat she was looking for the name Young (Jung).\u201d\nIt is clear that this lady, who had lost her husband at the age of\nthirty-nine, and had no prospect of marrying a second time, had\ncause enough to avoid reminiscences recalling youth or old age. The\nremarkable thing is that the concealing thoughts of the desired name\ncame to the surface as simple associations of content without any\nsound-associations.\n(_h_) Still different and very finely motivated is an example of\nname-forgetting which the person concerned has himself explained.\n\u201cWhile taking an examination in philosophy as a minor subject I was\nquestioned by the examiner about the teachings of Epicurus, and was\nasked whether I knew who took up his teachings centuries later. I\nanswered that it was Pierre Gassendi, whom two days before while in a\ncaf\u00e9 I had happened to hear spoken of as a follower of Epicurus. To the\nquestion how I knew this I boldly replied that I had taken an interest\nin Gassendi for a long time. This resulted in a certificate with a\n_magna cum laude_, but later, unfortunately, also in a persistent\ntendency to forget the name Gassendi. I believe that it is due to my\nguilty conscience that even now I cannot retain this name despite all\nefforts. I had no business knowing it at that time.\u201d\nTo have a proper appreciation of the intense repugnance entertained by\nour narrator against the recollection of this examination episode, one\nmust have realized how highly he prizes his doctor\u2019s degree, and for\nhow many other things this substitute must stand.\nI add here another example of forgetting the name of a city, an\ninstance which is perhaps not as simple as those given before, but\nwhich will appear credible and valuable to those more familiar with\nsuch investigations. The name of an Italian city withdrew itself\nfrom memory on account of its far-reaching sound-similarity to a\nwoman\u2019s first name, which was in turn connected with various emotional\nreminiscences which were surely not exhaustively treated in this\nreport. Dr. S. Ferenczi, who observed this case of forgetting in\nhimself, treated it--quite justly--as an analysis of a dream or an\nerotic idea.\n\u201cTo-day I visited some old friends, and the conversation turned to\ncities of Northern Italy. Some one remarked that they still showed the\nAustrian influence. A few of these cities were cited. I, too, wished\nto mention one, but the name did not come to me, although I knew that\nI had spent two very pleasant days there; this, of course, does not\nquite concur with Freud\u2019s theory of forgetting. Instead of the desired\nname of the city there obtruded themselves the following thoughts:\n\u2018Capua--Brescia--the lion of Brescia.\u2019 This lion I saw objectively\nbefore me in the form of a marble statue, but I soon noticed that he\nresembled less the lion of the statue of liberty in Brescia (which\nI saw only in a picture) than the other marble lion which I saw in\nLucerne on the monument in honour of the Swiss Guard fallen in the\nTuileries. I finally thought of the desired name: it was Verona.\n\u201cI knew at once the cause of this amnesia. No other than a former\nservant of the family whom I visited at the time. Her name was\nVeronica; in Hungarian Verona. I felt a great antipathy for her on\naccount of her repulsive physiognomy, as well as her hoarse, shrill\nvoice and her unbearable self-assertion (to which she thought herself\nentitled on account of her long service). Also the tyrannical way in\nwhich she treated the children of the family was insufferable to me.\nNow I knew the significance of the substitutive thoughts.\n\u201cTo Capua I immediately associated _caput mortuum_. I had often\ncompared Veronica\u2019s head to a skull. The Hungarian word _kapzoi_ (greed\nafter money) surely furnished a determinant for the displacement.\nNaturally I also found those more direct associations which connected\nCapua and Verona as geographical ideas and as Italian words of the same\nrhythm.\n\u201cThe same held true for Brescia; here, too, I found concealed\nside-tracks of associations of ideas.\n\u201cMy antipathy at that time was so violent that I thought Veronica very\nugly, and have often expressed my astonishment at the fact that any one\nshould love her: \u2018Why, to kiss her,\u2019 I said, \u2018must provoke nausea.\u2019\n\u201cBrescia, at least in Hungary, is very often mentioned not in\nconnection with the lion but with another wild beast. The most hated\nname in this country, as well as in North Italy, is that of General\nHaynau, who is briefly referred to as the hyena of Brescia. From the\nhated tyrant Haynau one stream of thought leads over Brescia to the\ncity of Verona, and the other over the idea of the _grave-digging\nanimal with the hoarse voice_ (which corresponds to the thought of a\nmonument to the dead), to the skull, and to the disagreeable organ\nof Veronica, which was so cruelly insulted in my unconscious mind.\nVeronica in her time ruled as tyrannically as did the Austrian General\nafter the Hungarian and Italian struggles for liberty.\n\u201cLucerne is associated with the idea of the summer which Veronica spent\nwith her employers in a place near Lucerne. The Swiss Guard again\nrecalls that she tyrannized not only the children but also the adult\nmembers of the family, and thus played the part of the \u2018Garde-Dame.\u2019\n\u201cI expressly observe that this antipathy of mine against V. consciously\nbelongs to things long overcome. Since that time she has changed in her\nappearance and manner, very much to her advantage, so that I am able to\nmeet her with sincere regard (to be sure I hardly find such occasion).\nAs usual, however, my unconscious sticks more tenaciously to those\nimpressions; it is old in its resentment.\n\u201cThe Tuileries represent an allusion to a second personality, an old\nFrench lady who actually \u2018guarded\u2019 the women of the house, and who was\nin high regard and somewhat feared by everybody. For a long time I was\nher _\u00e9l\u00e8ve_ in French conversation. The word _\u00e9l\u00e8ve_ recalls that when\nI visited the brother-in-law of my present host in northern Bohemia I\nhad to laugh a great deal because the rural population referred to the\n_\u00e9l\u00e8ves_ (pupils) of the school of forestry as _l\u00f6wen_ (lions). Also\nthis jocose recollection might have taken part in the displacement of\nthe hyena by the lion.\u201d\n(_i_) The following example can also show how a personal complex\nswaying the person at the time being may by devious ways bring about\nthe forgetting of a name.[7]\nTwo men, an elder and a younger, who had travelled together in Sicily\nsix months before, exchanged reminiscences of those pleasant and\ninteresting days.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, what was the name of that place,\u201d asked the younger, \u201cwhere\nwe passed the night before taking the trip to Selinunt? _Calatafini_,\nwas it not?\u201d\nThe elder rejected this by saying: \u201cCertainly not; but I have forgotten\nthe name, too, although I can recall perfectly all the details of the\nplace. Whenever I hear some one forget a name it immediately produces\nforgetfulness in me. Let us look for the name. I cannot think of any\nother name except _Caltanisetta_, which is surely not correct.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the younger, \u201cthe name begins with, or contains, a _w_.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Italian language contains no _w_,\u201d retorted the elder.\n\u201cI really meant a _v_, and I said _w_ because I am accustomed to\ninterchange them in my mother tongue.\u201d\nThe elder, however, objected to the _v_. He added: \u201cI believe that I\nhave already forgotten many of the Sicilian names. Suppose we try to\nfind out. For example, what is the name of the place situated on a\nheight which was called _Enna_ in antiquity?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know that: _Castrogiovanni_.\u201d In the next moment the younger\nman discovered the lost name. He cried out \u2018_Castelvetrano_,\u2019 and was\npleased to be able to demonstrate the supposed _v_.\nFor a moment the elder still lacked the feeling of recognition, but\nafter he accepted the name he was able to state why it had escaped him.\nHe thought: \u201cObviously because the second half, _vetrano_, suggests\n_veteran_. I am aware that I am not quite anxious to think of ageing,\nand react peculiarly when I am reminded of it. Thus, _e.g._, I had\nrecently reminded a very esteemed friend in most unmistakable terms\nthat he had \u2018long ago passed the years of youth,\u2019 because before this\nhe once remarked in the most flattering manner, \u2018I am no longer a\nyoung man.\u2019 That my resistance was directed against the second half of\nthe name _Castelvetrano_ is shown by the fact that the initial sound of\nthe same returned in the substitutive name Caltanisetta.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the name Caltanisetta itself?\u201d asked the younger.\n\u201cThat always seemed to me like a pet name of a young woman,\u201d admitted\nthe elder.\nSomewhat later he added: \u201cThe name for _Enna_ was also only\na substitutive name. And now it occurs to me that the name\n_Castrogiovanni_, which obtruded itself with the aid of a\nrationalization, alludes as expressly to _giovane_, young, as the last\nname, _Castelvetrano_, to _veteran_.\u201d\nThe older man believed that he had thus accounted for his forgetting\nthe name. What the motive was that led the young man to this memory\nfailure was not investigated.\nIn some cases one must have recourse to all the fineness of\npsychoanalytic technique in order to explain the forgetting of a\nname. Those who wish to read an example of such work I refer to a\ncommunication by Professor E. Jones.[8]\nI could multiply the examples of name-forgetting and prolong the\ndiscussion very much further if I did not wish to avoid elucidating\nhere almost all the view-points which will be considered in later\nthemes. I shall, however, take the liberty of comprehending in a few\nsentences the results of the analyses reported here.\nThe mechanism of forgetting, or rather of losing or temporary\nforgetting of a name, consists in the disturbance of the intended\nreproduction of the name through a strange stream of thought\nunconscious at the time. Between the disturbed name and the disturbing\ncomplex there exists a connection either from the beginning or such\na connection has been formed--perhaps by artificial means--through\nsuperficial (outer) associations.\nThe self-reference complex (personal, family or professional) proves to\nbe the most effective of the disturbing complexes.\nA name which by virtue of its many meanings belongs to a number of\nthought associations (complexes) is frequently disturbed in its\nconnection to one series of thoughts through a stronger complex\nbelonging to the other associations.\nTo avoid the awakening of pain through memory is one of the objects\namong the motives of these disturbances.\nIn general one may distinguish two principal cases of name-forgetting;\nwhen the name itself touches something unpleasant, or when it is\nbrought into connection with other associations which are influenced by\nsuch effects. So that names can be disturbed on their own account or\non account of their nearer or more remote associative relations in the\nreproduction.\nA review of these general principles readily convinces us that the\ntemporary forgetting of a name is observed as the most frequent faulty\naction of our mental functions.\nHowever, we are far from having described all the peculiarities of\nthis phenomenon. I also wish to call attention to the fact that\nname-forgetting is extremely contagious. In a conversation between\ntwo persons the mere mention of having forgotten this or that name by\none often suffices to induce the same memory slip in the other. But\nwherever the forgetting is induced, the sought for name easily comes to\nthe surface.\nThere is also a continuous forgetting of names in which whole chains\nof names are withdrawn from memory. If in the course of endeavouring\nto discover an escaped name one finds others with which the latter\nis intimately connected, it often happens that these new names also\nescape. The forgetting thus jumps from one name to another, as if to\ndemonstrate the existence of a hindrance not to be easily removed.\nIV\nCHILDHOOD AND CONCEALING MEMORIES\nIn a second essay[9] I was able to demonstrate the purposive nature\nof our memories in an unexpected field. I started with the remarkable\nfact that the earliest recollections of a person often seemed to\npreserve the unimportant and accidental, whereas (frequently though\nnot universally!) not a trace is found in the adult memory of the\nweighty and affective impressions of this period. As it is known that\nthe memory exercises a certain selection among the impressions at\nits disposal, it would seem logical to suppose that this selection\nfollows entirely different principles in childhood than at the time\nof intellectual maturity. However, close investigation points to the\nfact that such an assumption is superfluous. The indifferent childhood\nmemories owe their existence to a process of displacement. It may be\nshown by psychoanalysis that in the reproduction they represent the\nsubstitute for other really significant impressions, whose direct\nreproduction is hindered by some resistance. As they do not owe their\nexistence to their own contents, but to an associative relation of\ntheir contents to another repressed thought, they deserve the title of\n\u201cconcealing memories,\u201d by which I have designated them.\nIn the aforementioned essay I only touched upon, but in no way\nexhausted, the varieties in the relations and meanings of concealed\nmemories. In the given example fully analysed I particularly emphasized\na peculiarity in the temporal relation between the concealing memory\nand the contents of the memory concealed by it. The content of the\nconcealing memory in that example belonged to one of the first years\nof childhood, while the thoughts represented by it, which remained\npractically unconscious, belonged to a later period of the individual\nin question. I called this form of displacement a retro-active\nor _regressive_ one. Perhaps more often one finds the reversed\nrelation--that is, an indifferent impression of the most remote period\nbecomes a concealing memory in consciousness, which simply owes its\nexistence to an association with an earlier experience, against\nwhose direct reproduction there are resistances. We would call these\n_encroaching_ or _interposing_ concealing memories. What most concerns\nthe memory lies here chronologically beyond the concealing memory.\nFinally, there may be a third possible case, namely, the concealing\nmemory may be connected with the impression it conceals, not only\nthrough its contents, but also through contiguity of time; this is the\n_contemporaneous_ or _contiguous_ concealing memory.\nHow large a portion of the sum total of our memory belongs to the\ncategory of concealing memories, and what part it plays in various\nneurotic hidden processes, these are problems into the value of which I\nhave neither inquired nor shall I enter here. I am concerned only with\nemphasizing the sameness between the forgetting of proper names with\nfaulty recollection and the formation of concealing memories.\nAt first sight it would seem that the diversities of both phenomena are\nfar more striking than their exact analogies. There we deal with proper\nnames, here with complete impressions experienced either in reality\nor in thought; there we deal with a manifest failure of the memory\nfunction, here with a memory act which appears strange to us. Again,\nthere we are concerned with a momentary disturbance--for the name just\nforgotten could have been reproduced correctly a hundred times before,\nand will be so again from to-morrow on; here we deal with lasting\npossession without a failure, for the indifferent childhood memories\nseem to be able to accompany us through a great part of life. In both\nthese cases the riddle seems to be solved in an entirely different way.\nThere it is the forgetting, while here it is the remembering which\nexcites our scientific curiosity.\nAfter deeper reflection one realizes that, although there is a\ndiversity in the psychic material and in the duration of time of the\ntwo phenomena, yet these are by far outweighed by the conformities\nbetween the two. In both cases we deal with the failure of remembering:\nwhat should be correctly reproduced by the memory fails to appear,\nand instead something else comes as a substitute. In the case of\nforgetting a name there is no lack of memory function in the form\nof name substitution. The formation of a concealing memory depends\non the forgetting of other important impressions. In both cases we\nare reminded by an intellectual feeling of the intervention of a\ndisturbance, which in each case takes a different form. In the case\nof forgetting of names we are aware that the substitutive names\nare incorrect, while in concealing memories we are surprised that\nwe have them at all. Hence, if psychologic analysis demonstrates\nthat the substitutive formation in each case is brought about in\nthe same manner--that is, through displacement along a superficial\nassociation--we are justified in saying that the diversities in\nmaterial, in duration of time, and in the centring of both phenomena\nserve to enhance our expectation, that we have discovered something\nthat is important and of general value. This generality purports that\nthe stopping and straying of the reproducing function indicates more\noften than we suppose that there is an intervention of a prejudicial\nfactor, a tendency which favours one memory and at the same time works\nagainst another.\nThe subject of childhood memories appears to me so important and\ninteresting that I would like to devote to it a few additional remarks\nwhich go beyond the views expressed so far.\nHow far back into childhood do our memories reach? I am familiar\nwith some investigations on this question by V. and C. Henri[10] and\nPotwin.[11] They assert that such examinations show wide individual\nvariations, inasmuch as some trace their first reminiscences to\nthe sixth month of life, while others can recall nothing of their\nlives before the end of the sixth or even the eighth year. But what\nconnection is there between these variations in the behaviour of\nchildhood reminiscences, and what signification may be ascribed to\nthem? It seems that it is not enough to procure the material for this\nquestion by simple inquiry, but it must later be subjected to a study\nin which the person furnishing the information must participate.\nI believe we accept too indifferently the fact of infantile\namnesia--that is, the failure of memory for the first years of our\nlives--and fail to find in it a strange riddle. We forget of what\ngreat intellectual accomplishments and of what complicated emotions\na child of four years is capable. We really ought to wonder why the\nmemory of later years has, as a rule, retained so little of these\npsychic processes, especially as we have every reason for assuming that\nthese same forgotten childhood activities have not glided off without\nleaving a trace in the development of the person, but that they have\nleft a definite influence for all future time. Yet in spite of this\nunparalleled effectiveness they were forgotten! This would suggest that\nthere are particularly formed conditions of memory (in the sense of\nconscious reproduction) which have thus far eluded our knowledge. It\nis quite possible that the forgetting of childhood may give us the key\nto the understanding of those amnesias which, according to our newer\nstudies, lie at the basis of the formation of all neurotic symptoms.\nOf these retained childhood reminiscences, some appear to us readily\ncomprehensible, while others seem strange or unintelligible. It is not\ndifficult to correct certain errors in regard to both kinds. If the\nretained reminiscences of a person are subjected to an analytic test,\nit can be readily ascertained that a guarantee for their correctness\ndoes not exist. Some of the memory pictures are surely falsified and\nincomplete, or displaced in point of time and place. The assertions of\npersons examined that their first memories reach back perhaps to their\nsecond year are evidently unreliable. Motives can soon be discovered\nwhich explain the disfigurement and the displacement of these\nexperiences, but they also demonstrate that these memory lapses are not\nthe result of a mere unreliable memory. Powerful forces from a later\nperiod have moulded the memory capacity of our infantile experiences,\nand it is probably due to these same forces that the understanding of\nour childhood is generally so very strange to us.\nThe recollection of adults, as is known, proceeds through different\npsychic material. Some recall by means of visual pictures--their\nmemories are of a visual character; other individuals can scarcely\nreproduce in memory the most paltry sketch of an experience; we\ncall such persons \u201c_auditifs_\u201d and \u201c_moteurs_\u201d in contrast to the\n\u201c_visuels_,\u201d terms proposed by Charcot. These differences vanish\nin dreams; all our dreams are preponderatingly visual. But this\ndevelopment is also found in the childhood memories; the latter are\nplastic and visual, even in those people whose later memory lacks the\nvisual element. The visual memory, therefore, preserves the type of\nthe infantile recollections. Only my earliest childhood memories are\nof a visual character; they represent plastically depicted scenes,\ncomparable only to stage settings.\nIn these scenes of childhood, whether they prove true or false, one\nusually sees his own childish person both in contour and dress. This\ncircumstance must excite our wonder, for adults do not see their\nown persons in their recollections of later experiences.[12] It is,\nmoreover, against our experiences to assume that the child\u2019s attention\nduring his experiences is centred on himself rather than exclusively\non outside impressions. Various sources force us to assume that the\nso-called earliest childhood recollections are not true memory traces\nbut later elaborations of the same, elaborations which might have been\nsubjected to the influences of many later psychic forces. Thus the\n\u201cchildhood reminiscences\u201d of individuals altogether advance to the\nsignification of \u201cconcealing memories,\u201d and thereby form a noteworthy\nanalogy to the childhood reminiscences as laid down in the legends and\nmyths of nations.\nWhoever has examined mentally a number of persons by the method of\npsychoanalysis must have gathered in this work numerous examples\nof concealing memories of every description. However, owing to\nthe previously discussed nature of the relations of the childhood\nreminiscences to later life, it becomes extraordinarily difficult\nto report such examples. For, in order to attach the value of the\nconcealing memory to an infantile reminiscence, it would be often\nnecessary to present the entire life-history of the person concerned.\nOnly seldom is it possible, as in the following good example, to take\nout from its context and report a single childhood memory.\nA twenty-four-year-old man preserved the following picture from the\nfifth year of his life: In the garden of a summer-house he sat on a\nstool next to his aunt, who was engaged in teaching him the alphabet.\nHe found difficulty in distinguishing the letter _m_ from _n_, and he\nbegged his aunt to tell him how to tell one from the other. His aunt\ncalled his attention to the fact that the letter _m_ had one whole\nportion (a stroke) more than the letter _n_. There was no reason to\ndispute the reliability of this childhood recollection; its meaning,\nhowever, was discovered only later, when it showed itself to be the\nsymbolic representation of another boyish inquisitiveness. For just as\nhe wanted to know the difference between _m_ and _n_ at that time,\nso he concerned himself later about the difference between boy and\ngirl, and he would have been willing that just this aunt should be his\nteacher. He also discovered that the difference was a similar one; that\nthe boy again had one whole portion more than the girl, and at the time\nof this recognition his memory awoke to the corresponding childish\ninquisitiveness.\nI would like to show by one more example the sense that may be gained\nby a childhood reminiscence through analytic work, although it may\nseem to contain no sense before. In my forty-third year, when I began\nto interest myself in what remained in my memory of my own childhood,\na scene struck me which for a long time, as I afterwards believed,\nhad repeatedly come to consciousness, and which through reliable\nidentification could be traced to a period before the completion of my\nthird year. I saw myself in front of a chest, the door of which was\nheld open by my half-brother, twenty years my senior. I stood there\ndemanding something and screaming; my mother, pretty and slender, then\nsuddenly entered the room, as if returning from the street.\nIn these words I formulated this scene so vividly seen, which, however,\nfurnished no other clue. Whether my brother wished to open or lock the\nchest (in the first explanation it was a \u201ccupboard\u201d), why I cried,\nand what bearing the arrival of my mother had, all these questions\nwere dim to me; I was tempted to explain to myself that it dealt with\nthe memory of a hoax by my older brother, which was interrupted by my\nmother. Such misunderstandings of childhood scenes retained in memory\nare not uncommon; we recall a situation, but it is not centralized;\nwe do not know on which of the elements to place the psychic accent.\nAnalytic effort led me to an entirely unexpected solution of the\npicture. I missed my mother and began to suspect that she was locked in\nthis cupboard or chest, and therefore demanded that my brother should\nunlock it. As he obliged me, and I became convinced that she was not in\nthe chest, I began to cry; this is the moment firmly retained in the\nmemory, which was directly followed by the appearance of my mother, who\nappeased my worry and anxiety.\nBut how did the child get the idea of looking for the absent mother\nin the chest? Dreams which occurred at the same time pointed dimly to\na nurse, concerning whom other reminiscences were retained; as, for\nexample, that she conscientiously urged me to deliver to her the small\ncoins which I received as gifts, a detail which in itself may lay claim\nto the value of a concealing memory for later things. I then concluded\nto facilitate for myself this time the task of interpretation, and\nasked my now aged mother about that nurse. I found out all sorts of\nthings, among others the fact that this shrewd but dishonest person had\ncommitted extensive robberies during the confinement of my mother, and\nthat my half-brother was instrumental in bringing her to justice.\nThis information gave me the key to the scene from childhood, as\nthrough a sort of inspiration. The sudden disappearance of the nurse\nwas not a matter of indifference to me; I had just asked this brother\nwhere she was, probably because I had noticed that he had played a\npart in her disappearance, and he, evasive and witty as he is to this\nday, answered that she was \u201cboxed in.\u201d I understood this answer in\nthe childish way, but asked no more, as there was nothing else to be\ndiscovered. When my mother left me shortly thereafter I suspected that\nthe naughty brother had treated her in the same way as he did the\nnurse, and therefore pressed him to open the chest.\nI also understand now why in the translation of the visual childhood\nscene my mother\u2019s slenderness was accentuated; she must have struck\nme as being newly restored. I am two and a half years older than the\nsister born at that time, and when I was three years of age I was\nseparated from my half-brother.\nV\nMISTAKES IN SPEECH\nAlthough the ordinary material of speech of our mother-tongue seems to\nbe guarded against forgetting, its application, however, more often\nsuccumbs to another disturbance which is familiar to us as \u201cslips\nof the tongue.\u201d What we observe in normal persons as slips of the\ntongue gives the same impression as the first step of the so-called\n\u201cparaphasias\u201d which manifest themselves under pathologic conditions.\nI am in the exceptional position of being about to refer to a previous\nwork on the subject. In the year 1895 Meringer and C. Mayer published\na study on _Mistakes in Speech and Reading_, with whose view-points I\ndo not agree. One of the authors, who is the spokesman in the text,\nis a philologist actuated by a linguistic interest to examine the\nrules governing those slips. He hoped to deduce from these rules the\nexistence \u201cof a definite psychic mechanism,\u201d \u201cwhereby the sounds of a\nword, of a sentence, and even the words themselves, would be associated\nand connected with one another in a quite peculiar manner\u201d (p. 10).\nThe authors grouped the examples of speech-mistakes collected by\nthem first according to purely descriptive view-points, such as\ninterchangings (_e.g._, the Milo of Venus instead of the Venus of\nMilo), as anticipations (_e.g._, the shoes made her sorft ... the shoes\nmade her feet sore), as echoes and post positions, as contaminations\n(_e.g._, \u201cI will soon him home,\u201d instead of \u201cI will soon go home and\nI will see him\u201d), and substitutions (_e.g._, \u201che entrusted his money\nto a savings crank,\u201d instead of \u201ca savings bank\u201d).[13] Besides these\nprincipal categories there are some others of lesser importance (or\nof lesser significance for our purpose). In this grouping it makes no\ndifference whether the transposition, disfigurement, fusion, etc.,\naffects single sounds of the word or syllables, or whole words of the\nconcerned sentence.\nTo explain the various forms of mistakes in speech, Meringer assumes a\nvaried psychic value of phonetics. As soon as the innervation affects\nthe first syllable of a word, or the first word of a sentence, the\nstimulating process immediately strikes the succeeding sounds, and the\nfollowing words, and in so far as these innervations are synchronous\nthey may effect some changes in one another. The stimulus of the\npsychically more intensive sound \u201crings\u201d before or continues echoing,\nand thus disturbs the less important process of innervation. It is\nnecessary therefore to determine which are the most important sounds\nof a word. Meringer states: \u201cIf one wishes to know which sound of a\nword possesses the greatest intensity he should examine himself while\nsearching for a forgotten word, for example, a name. That which first\nreturns to consciousness invariably had the greatest intensity prior to\nthe forgetting (p. 160). Thus the most important sounds are the initial\nsound of the root-syllable and the initial sound of the word itself, as\nwell as one or another of the accentuated vowels\u201d (p. 162).\nHere I cannot help voicing a contradiction. Whether or not the initial\nsound of the name belongs to the most important elements of the word,\nit is surely not true that in the case of the forgetting of the word\nit first returns to consciousness; the above rule is therefore of no\nuse. When we observe ourselves during the search for a forgotten name\nwe are comparatively often forced to express the opinion that it begins\nwith a certain letter. This conviction proves to be as often unfounded\nas founded. Indeed, I would even go so far as to assert that in the\nmajority of cases one reproduces a false initial sound. Also in our\nexample _Signorelli_ the substitutive name lacked the initial sound,\nand the principal syllables were lost; on the other hand, the less\nimportant pair of syllables _elli_ returned to consciousness in the\nsubstitutive name _Botticelli_.\nHow little substitutive names respect the initial sound of the lost\nnames may be learned from the following case. One day I found it\nimpossible to recall the name of the small country whose capital is\nMonte Carlo. The substitutive names were as follows: _Piedmont_,\n_Albania_, _Montevideo_, _Colico_. In place of Albania _Montenegro_\nsoon appeared, and then it struck me that the syllable _Mont_\n(pronounced _Mon_) occurred in all but the last of the substitutive\nnames. It thus became easy for me to find from the name of Prince\nAlbert the forgotten name _Monaco_. _Colico_ practically imitates the\nsyllabic sequence and rhythm of the forgotten name.\nIf we admit the conjecture that a mechanism similar to that pointed\nout in the forgetting of names may also play a part in the phenomena\nof speech-blunders, we are then led to a better founded judgment of\ncases of speech-blunders. The speech disturbance which manifests\nitself as a speech-blunder may in the first place be caused by the\ninfluence of another component of the same speech, that is, through a\nfore-sound or an echo, or through another meaning within the sentence\nor context which differs from that which the speaker wishes to utter.\nIn the second place, however, the disturbance could be brought about\nanalogously to the process in the case _Signorelli_, through influences\noutside this word, sentence or context, from elements which we did not\nintend to express, and of whose incitement we became conscious only\nthrough the disturbance. In both modes of origin of the mistake in\nspeech the common element lies in the simultaneity of the stimulus,\nwhile the differentiating elements lie in the arrangement within or\nwithout the same sentence or context.\nThe difference does not at first appear as wide as when it is taken\ninto consideration in certain conclusions drawn from the symptomatology\nof speech-mistakes. It is clear, however, that only in the first case\nis there a prospect of drawing conclusions from the manifestations of\nspeech-blunders concerning a mechanism which connects together sounds\nand words for the reciprocal influence of their articulation; that is,\nconclusions such as the philologist hopes to gain from the study of\nspeech-blunders. In the case of disturbance through influence outside\nof the same sentence or context, it would before all be a question of\nbecoming acquainted with the disturbing elements, and then the question\nwould arise whether the mechanism of this disturbance cannot also\nsuggest the probable laws of the formation of speech.\nWe cannot maintain that Meringer and Mayer have overlooked the\npossibility of speech disturbance through \u201ccomplicated psychic\ninfluences,\u201d that is, through elements outside of the same word or\nsentence or the same sequence of words. Indeed, they must have observed\nthat the theory of the psychic variation of sounds applies, strictly\nspeaking, only to the explanation of sound disturbances as well as to\nfore-sounds and after-sounds. Where the word disturbances cannot be\nreduced to sound disturbances, as, for example, in the substitutions\nand contaminations of words, they, too, have without hesitation sought\nthe cause of the mistake in speech outside of the intended context,\nand proved this state of affairs by means of fitting examples.[14]\nAccording to the author\u2019s own understanding it is some similarity\nbetween a certain word in the intended sentence and some other not\nintended, which allows the latter to assert itself in consciousness\nby causing a disfigurement, a composition, or a compromise formation\n(contamination).\nNow, in my work on the _Interpretation of Dreams_ I have shown the\npart played by the process of condensation in the origin of the\nso-called manifest contents of the dream from the latent thoughts of\nthe dream. Any similarity of objects or of word-presentations between\ntwo elements of the unconscious material is taken as a cause for the\nformation of a third, which is a composite or compromise formation.\nThis element represents both components in the dream content, and\nin view of this origin it is frequently endowed with numerous\ncontradictory individual determinants. The formation of substitutions\nand contaminations in speech-mistakes is, therefore, the beginning of\nthat work of condensation which we find taking a most active part in\nthe construction of the dream.\nIn a small essay destined for the general reader,[15] Meringer\nadvanced a theory of very practical significance for certain cases of\ninterchanging of words, especially for such cases where one word is\nsubstituted by another of opposite meaning. He says: \u201cWe may still\nrecall the manner in which the President of the Austrian House of\nDeputies opened the session some time ago: \u2018Honoured Sirs! I announce\nthe presence of so and so many gentlemen, and therefore declare\nthe session as \u201cclosed\u201d\u2019!\u201d The general merriment first attracted\nhis attention and he corrected his mistake. In the present case\nthe probable explanation is that the President wished himself in a\nposition to close this session, from which he had little good to\nexpect, and the thought broke through at least partially--a frequent\nmanifestation--resulting in his use of \u201cclosed\u201d in place of \u201copened,\u201d\nthat is, the opposite of the statement intended. Numerous observations\nhave taught me, however, that we frequently interchange contrasting\nwords; they are already associated in our speech consciousness; they\nlie very close together and are easily incorrectly evoked.\nStill, not in all cases of contrast substitution is it so simple\nas in the example of the President as to appear plausible that the\nspeech-mistake occurs merely as a contradiction which arises in the\ninner thought of the speaker opposing the sentence uttered. We have\nfound the analogous mechanism in the analysis of the example _aliquis_;\nthere the inner contradiction asserts itself in the form of forgetting\na word instead of a substitution through its opposite. But in order to\nadjust the difference we may remark that the little word _aliquis_ is\nincapable of a contrast similar to \u201cclosing\u201d and \u201copening,\u201d and that\nthe word \u201copening\u201d cannot be subject to forgetting on account of its\nbeing a common component of speech.\nHaving been shown by the last examples of Meringer and Mayer that\nspeech disturbance may be caused through the influence of fore-sounds,\nafter-sounds, words from the same sentence that were intended for\nexpression, as well as through the effect of words outside the sentence\nintended, _the stimulus of which would otherwise not have been\nsuspected_, we shall next wish to discover whether we can definitely\nseparate the two classes of mistakes in speech, and how we can\ndistinguish the example of the one from a case of the other class.\nBut at this stage of the discussion we must also think of the\nassertions of Wundt, who deals with the manifestations of\nspeech-mistakes in his recent work on the development of language.[16]\nPsychic influences, according to Wundt, never lack in these as well as\nin other phenomena related to them. \u201cThe uninhibited stream of _sound_\nand _word associations_ stimulated by spoken sounds belongs here in the\nfirst place as a positive determinant. This is supported as a negative\nfactor by the relaxation or suppression of the influences of the will\nwhich inhibit this stream, and by the active attention which is here a\nfunction of volition. Whether that play of association manifests itself\nin the fact that a coming sound is anticipated or a preceding sound\nreproduced, or whether a familiar practised sound becomes intercalated\nbetween others, or finally, whether it manifests itself in the fact\nthat altogether different sounds associatively related to the spoken\nsounds act upon these--all these questions designate only differences\nin the direction, and at most in the play of the occurring associations\nbut not in the general nature of the same. In some cases it may be\nalso doubtful to which form a certain disturbance may be attributed,\nor whether it would not be more correct to refer such disturbance\nto a concurrence of many motives, _following the principle of the\ncomplication of causes_[17] (cf. pp. 380-81).\u201d\nI consider these observations of Wundt as absolutely justified and very\ninstructive. Perhaps we could emphasize with even greater firmness\nthan Wundt that the positive factor favouring mistakes in speech (the\nuninhibited stream of associations, and its negative, the relaxation of\nthe inhibiting attention) regularly attain synchronous action, so that\nboth factors become only different determinants of the same process.\nWith the relaxation, or, more unequivocally expressed, _through_ this\nrelaxation, of the inhibiting attention the uninhibited stream of\nassociations becomes active.\nAmong the examples of the mistakes in speech collected by me I can\nscarcely find one in which I would be obliged to attribute the speech\ndisturbance simply and solely to what Wundt calls \u201ccontact effect\nof sound.\u201d Almost invariably I discover besides this a disturbing\ninfluence of something outside of the intended speech. The disturbing\nelement is either a single unconscious thought, which comes to light\nthrough the speech-blunder, and can only be brought to consciousness\nthrough a searching analysis, or it is a more general psychic motive,\nwhich directs itself against the entire speech.\n(_Example_ _a_) Seeing my daughter make an unpleasant face while biting\ninto an apple, I wished to quote the following couplet:--\n\u201cThe ape he is a funny sight,\nWhen in the apple he takes a bite.\u201d\nBut I began: \u201cThe apel....\u201d This seems to be a contamination of \u201cape\u201d\nand \u201capple\u201d (compromise formation), or it may be also conceived as\nan anticipation of the prepared \u201capple.\u201d The true state of affairs,\nhowever, was this: I began the quotation once before, and made no\nmistake the first time. I made the mistake only during the repetition,\nwhich was necessary because my daughter, having been distracted from\nanother side, did not listen to me. This repetition with the added\nimpatience to disburden myself of the sentence I must include in\nthe motivation of the speech-blunder, which represented itself as a\nfunction of condensation.\n(_b_) My daughter said, \u201cI wrote to Mrs. Schresinger.\u201d The woman\u2019s name\nwas Schlesinger. This speech-blunder may depend on the tendency to\nfacilitate articulation. I must state, however, that this mistake was\nmade by my daughter a few moments after I had said _apel_ instead of\n_ape_. Mistakes in speech are in a great measure contagious; a similar\npeculiarity was noticed by Meringer and Mayer in the forgetting of\nnames. I know of no reason for this psychic contagiousness.\n(_c_) \u201cI _sut_ up like a pocket-knife,\u201d said a patient in the beginning\nof treatment, instead of \u201cI _shut_ up.\u201d This suggests a difficulty\nof articulation which may serve as an excuse for the interchanging\nof sounds. When her attention was called to the speech-blunder, she\npromptly replied, \u201cYes, that happened because you said \u2018_earnesht_\u2019\ninstead of \u2018_earnest_.\u2019\u201d As a matter of fact I received her with the\nremark, \u201cTo-day we shall be in earnest\u201d (because it was the last hour\nbefore her discharge from treatment), and I jokingly changed the word\ninto _earnesht_. In the course of the hour she repeatedly made mistakes\nin speech, and I finally observed that it was not only because she\nimitated me but because she had a special reason in her unconscious to\nlinger at the word earnest (Ernst) as a name.[18]\n(_d_) A woman, speaking about a game invented by her children and\ncalled by them \u201cthe man in the box,\u201d said \u201cthe manx in the boc.\u201d\nI could readily understand her mistake. It was while analysing\nher dream, in which her husband is depicted as very generous in\nmoney matters--just the reverse of reality--that she made this\nspeech-blunder. The day before she had asked for a new set of furs,\nwhich her husband denied her, claiming that he could not afford to\nspend so much money. She upbraided him for his stinginess, \u201cfor putting\naway so much into the strong-box,\u201d and mentioned a friend whose husband\nhas not nearly his income, and yet he presented his wife with a _mink_\ncoat for her birthday. The mistake is now comprehensible. The word\n_manx_ (_manks_) reduces itself to the \u201cminks\u201d which she longs for, and\nthe _box_ refers to her husband\u2019s stinginess.\n(_e_) A similar mechanism is shown in the mistake of another patient\nwhose memory deserted her in the midst of a long-forgotten childish\nreminiscence. Her memory failed to inform her on what part of the body\nthe prying and lustful hand of another had touched her. Soon thereafter\nshe visited one of her friends, with whom she discussed summer homes.\nAsked where her cottage in M. was located, she answered, \u201cNear the\n_mountain loin_\u201d instead of \u201c_mountain lane_.\u201d\n(_f_) Another patient, whom I asked at the end of her visit how her\nuncle was, answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I only see him now _in flagranti_.\u201d\nThe following day she said, \u201cI am really ashamed of myself for having\ngiven you yesterday such a stupid answer. Naturally you must have\nthought me a very uneducated person who always mistakes the meaning\nof foreign words. I wished to say _en passant_.\u201d We did not know at\nthe time where she got the incorrectly used foreign words, but during\nthe same session she reproduced a reminiscence as a continuation of\nthe theme from the previous day, in which being caught _in flagranti_\nplayed the principal part. The mistake of the previous day had\ntherefore anticipated the recollection, which at that time had not yet\nbecome conscious.\n(_g_) In discussing her summer plans, a patient said, \u201cI shall remain\nmost of the summer in _Elberlon_.\u201d She noted her mistake, and asked me\nto analyse it. The associations to _Elberlon_ elicited: seashore on\nthe Jersey coast--summer resort--vacation travelling. This recalled\ntravelling in Europe with her cousin, a topic which we had discussed\nthe day before during the analysis of a dream. The dream dealt with\nher dislike for this cousin, and she admitted that it was mainly due\nto the fact that the latter was the favourite of the man whom they met\ntogether while travelling abroad. During the dream analysis she could\nnot recall the name of the city in which they met this man, and I did\nnot make any effort at the time to bring it to her consciousness, as we\nwere engrossed in a totally different problem. When asked to focus her\nattention again on Elberlon and reproduce her associations, she said,\n\u201cIt brings to mind _Elberlawn_--_lawn_--_field_--and _Elberfield_.\u201d\n_Elberfeld_ was the lost name of the city in Germany. Here the mistake\nserved to bring to consciousness in a concealed manner a memory which\nwas connected with a painful feeling.\n(_h_) A woman said to me, \u201cIf you wish to buy a carpet, go to\n_Merchant_ (Kaufmann) in _Matthew Street_ (Math\u00e4usgasse).\u201d I repeated,\n\u201cThen at Matthew\u2019s--I mean at Merchant\u2019s----\u201d It would seem that my\nrepeating of one name in place of the other was simply the result of\ndistraction. The woman\u2019s remark really did distract me, as she turned\nmy attention to something else much more vital to me than carpet. In\nMatthew Street stands the house in which my wife lived as a bride.\nThe entrance to the house was in another street, and now I noticed\nthat I had forgotten its name and could only recall it through a\nroundabout method. The name Matthew, which kept my attention, is thus\na substitutive name for the forgotten name of the street. It is more\nsuitable than the name Merchant, for Matthew is exclusively the name of\na person, while Merchant is not. The forgotten street, too, bears the\nname of a person: _Radetzky_.\n(_i_) A patient consulted me for the first time, and from her history\nit became apparent that the cause of her nervousness was largely an\nunhappy married life. Without any encouragement she went into details\nabout her marital troubles. She had not lived with her husband for\nabout six months, and she saw him last at the theatre, when she saw\nthe play _Officer 606_. I called her attention to the mistake, and she\nimmediately corrected herself, saying that she meant to say _Officer\n666_ (the name of a recent popular play). I decided to find out the\nreason for the mistake, and as the patient came to me for analytic\ntreatment, I discovered that the immediate cause of the rupture between\nherself and husband was the disease which is treated by \u201c606.\u201d[19]\n(_k_) Before calling on me a patient telephoned for an appointment,\nand also wished to be informed about my consultation fee. He was told\nthat the first consultation was ten dollars; after the examination was\nover he again asked what he was to pay, and added: \u201cI don\u2019t like to owe\nmoney to any one, especially to doctors; I prefer to pay right away.\u201d\nInstead of _pay_ he said _play_. His last voluntary remarks and his\nmistake put me on my guard, but after a few more uncalled-for remarks\nhe set me at ease by taking money from his pocket. He counted four\npaper dollars and was very chagrined and surprised because he had no\nmore money with him, and promised to send me a cheque for the balance.\nI was sure that his mistake betrayed him, that he was only _playing_\nwith me, but there was nothing to be done. At the end of a few weeks I\nsent him a bill for the balance, and the letter was returned to me by\nthe post-office authorities marked \u201cNot found.\u201d\n(_l_) Miss X. spoke very warmly of Mr. Y., which was rather strange, as\nbefore this she had always expressed her indifference, not to say her\ncontempt, for him. On being asked about this sudden change of heart she\nsaid: \u201cI really never had anything against him; he was always nice to\nme, but I never gave him the chance to cultivate my acquaintance.\u201d She\nsaid \u201ccuptivate.\u201d This neologism was a contamination of _cultivate_ and\n_captivate_, and foretold the coming betrothal.\n(_m_) An illustration of the mechanisms of contamination and\ncondensation will be found in the following _lapsus lingu\u00e6_. Speaking\nof Miss Z., Miss W. depicted her as a very \u201cstraitlaced\u201d person who\nwas not given to levities, etc. Miss X. thereupon remarked: \u201cYes,\nthat is a very characteristic description, she always appealed to me\nas very \u2018_straicet-brazed_.\u2019\u201d Here the mistake resolved itself into\n_straitlaced_ and _brazen-faced_, which corresponded to Miss W.\u2019s\nopinion of Miss Z.\n(_n_) I shall quote a number of examples from a paper by my colleague,\nDr. W. Stekel, which appeared in the Berlin _Tageblatt_ of January,\n1904, entitled \u201cUnconscious Confessions.\u201d\n\u201cAn unpleasant trick of my unpleasant thoughts was revealed by the\nfollowing example: To begin with, I may state that in my capacity\nas a physician I never consider my remuneration, but always keep in\nview the patient\u2019s interest only: this goes without saying. I was\nvisiting a patient who was convalescing from a serious illness. We\nhad passed through hard days and nights. I was happy to find her\nimproved, and I portrayed to her the pleasures of a sojourn in Abbazia,\nconcluding with: \u2018If, as I hope, you will _not_ soon leave your bed.\u2019\nThis obviously came from an unconscious selfish motive, to be able\nto continue treating this wealthy patient, a wish which is entirely\nforeign to my waking consciousness, and which I would reject with\nindignation.\u201d\n(_o_) Another example (Dr. W. Stekel): \u201cMy wife engaged a French\ngoverness for the afternoons, and later, coming to a satisfactory\nagreement, wished to retain her testimonials. The governess begged\nto be allowed to keep them, saying, \u2018Je cherche encore pour les\n_apr\u00e8s-midis_--pardons, pour les _avant-midis_.\u2019 She apparently\nintended to seek another place which would perhaps offer more\nprofitable arrangements--an intention which she carried out.\u201d\n(_p_) I was to give a lecture to a woman. Her husband, upon whose\nrequest this was done, stood behind the door listening. At the end of\nmy sermonizing, which had made a visible impression, I said: \u201cGood-bye,\nsir!\u201d To the experienced person I thus betrayed the fact that the words\nwere directed towards the husband; that I had spoken to oblige him.\n(_q_) Dr. Stekel reports about himself that he had under treatment\nat the same time two patients from Triest, each of whom he always\naddressed incorrectly. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Peloni!\u201d he would say to\nAskoli, and to Peloni, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Askoli!\u201d He was at first\ninclined to attribute no deeper motive to this mistake, but to explain\nit through a number of similarities in both persons. However, he easily\nconvinced himself that here the interchange of names bespoke a sort\nof boast--that is, he was acquainting each of his Italian patients\nwith the fact that neither was the only resident of Triest who came to\nVienna in search of his medical advice.\n(_r_) Two women stopped in front of a drug-store, and one said to her\ncompanion, \u201cIf you will wait a few _moments_ I\u2019ll soon be back,\u201d but\nshe said _movements_ instead. She was on her way to buy some castoria\nfor her child.\n(_s_) Mr. L., who is fonder of being called on than of calling, spoke\nto me through the telephone from a nearby summer resort. He wanted\nto know when I would pay him a visit. I reminded him that it was his\nturn to visit me, and called his attention to the fact that, as he was\nthe happy possessor of an automobile, it would be easier for him to\ncall on me. (We were at different summer resorts, separated by about\none half-hour\u2019s railway trip.) He gladly promised to call, and asked:\n\u201cHow about Labour Day (September 1st), will it be convenient for you?\u201d\nWhen I answered affirmatively, he said, \u201cVery well, then, put me down\nfor _Election_ Day\u201d (November). His mistake was quite plain. He likes\nto visit me, but it was inconvenient to travel so far. In November we\nwould both be in the city. My analysis proved correct.\n(_t_) A friend described to me a nervous patient, and wished to know\nwhether I could benefit him. I remarked: \u201cI believe that in time I can\nremove all his symptoms by psychoanalysis, because it is a durable\ncase,\u201d wishing to say \u201ccurable\u201d!\n(_u_) I repeatedly addressed my patient as Mrs. Smith, her married\ndaughter\u2019s name, when her real name is Mrs. James. My attention having\nbeen called to it, I soon discovered that I had another patient of the\nsame name who refused to pay for the treatment. Mrs. Smith was also my\npatient and paid her bills promptly.\n(_v_) A _lapsus lingu\u00e6_ sometimes stands for a particular\ncharacteristic. A young woman, who is the domineering spirit in her\nhome, said of her ailing husband that he had consulted the doctor about\na wholesome diet for himself, and then added: \u201cThe doctor said that\ndiet has nothing to do with his ailments, and that he can eat and drink\nwhat _I_ want.\u201d\n(_w_) I cannot omit this excellent and instructive example, although,\naccording to my authority, it is about twenty years old. A lady once\nexpressed herself in society--the very words show that they were\nuttered with fervour and under the pressure of a great many secret\nemotions: \u201cYes, a woman must be pretty if she is to please the men. A\nman is much better off. As long as he has _five_ straight limbs, he\nneeds no more!\u201d\nThis example affords us a good insight into the intimate mechanisms of\na mistake in speech by means of condensation and contamination (cf.\np. 72). It is quite obvious that we have here a fusion of two similar\nmodes of expression:--\n\u201cAs long as he has his four _straight limbs_.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as he has all his _five senses_.\u201d\nOr the term \u201cstraight\u201d may be the common element of the two intended\nexpressions:--\n\u201cAs long as he has his _straight_ limbs.\u201d\n\u201cAll five should be _straight_.\u201d\nIt may also be assumed that both modes of expression--viz., those of\nthe five senses and those of the straight five--have co-operated to\nintroduce into the sentence about the straight limbs first a number and\nthen the mysterious five instead of the simple four. But this fusion\nsurely would not have succeeded if it had not expressed good sense in\nthe form resulting from the mistake; if it had not expressed a cynical\ntruth which, naturally, could not be uttered unconcealed, coming as it\ndid from a woman.\nFinally, we shall not hesitate to call attention to the fact that\nthe woman\u2019s saying, following its wording, could just as well be\nan excellent witticism as a jocose speech-blunder. It is simply a\nquestion whether she uttered these words with conscious or unconscious\nintention. The behaviour of the speaker in this case certainly speaks\nagainst the conscious intention, and thus excludes wit.\n(_x_) Owing to similarity of material, I add here another case of\nspeech-blunder, the interpretation of which requires less skill. A\nprofessor of anatomy strove to explain the nostril, which, as is known,\nis a very difficult anatomical structure. To his question whether\nhis audience grasped his ideas he received an affirmative reply. The\nprofessor, known for his self-esteem, thereupon remarked: \u201cI can\nhardly believe this, for the number of people who understand the\nnostril, even in a city of millions like Vienna, can be counted _on a\nfinger_--pardon me, I meant to say _on the fingers_ of a hand.\u201d\n(_y_) I am indebted to Dr. Alf. Robitsek, of Vienna, for calling my\nattention to two speech-blunders from an old French author, which I\nshall reproduce in the original.\nBrant\u00f4me (1527-1614), _Vies des Dames galantes_, Discours second: \u201cSi\nay-je cogneu une tr\u00e8s belle et honneste dame de par le monde, qui,\ndevisant avec un honneste gentilhomme de la cour des affaires de la\nguerre durant ces civiles, elle luy dit: \u2018J\u2019ay ouy dire que le roy a\nfaiet rompre tous les c---- de ce pays l\u00e0.\u2019 Elle vouloit dire le ponts.\nPensez que, venant de coucher d\u2019avec son mary, ou songeant \u00e0 son amant,\nelle avoit encor ce nom frais en la bouche; et le gentilhomme s\u2019en\neschauffer en amours d\u2019elle pour ce mot.\n\u201cUne autre dame que j\u2019ai cogneue, entretenant une autre grand dame\nplus qu\u2019elle, et luy louant et exaltant ses beautez, elle luy dit\napr\u00e8s: \u2018Non, madame, ce que je vous en dis, ce n\u2019est point pour vous\n_adult\u00e9rer_\u2019; voulant dire _adulater_, comme elle le rhabilla ainsi:\npensez qu\u2019elle songeoit \u00e0 adult\u00e9rer.\u201d\nIn the psychotherapeutic procedure which I employ in the solution and\nremoval of neurotic symptoms, I am often confronted with the task\nof discovering from the accidental utterances and fancies of the\npatient the thought contents, which, though striving for concealment,\nnevertheless unintentionally betray themselves. In doing this the\nmistakes often perform the most valuable service, as I can show through\nmost convincing and still most singular examples.\nFor example, patients speak of an aunt and later, without noting the\nmistake, call her \u201cmy mother,\u201d or designate a husband as a \u201cbrother.\u201d\nIn this way they attract my attention to the fact that they have\n\u201cidentified\u201d these persons with each other, that they have placed them\nin the same category, which for their emotional life signifies the\nrecurrence of the same type. Or, a young man of twenty years presents\nhimself during my office hours with these words: \u201cI am the father of\nN. N., whom you have treated--pardon me, I mean the brother; why, he\nis four years older than I.\u201d I understand through this mistake that\nhe wishes to express that, like the brother, he, too, is ill through\nthe fault of the father; like his brother, he wishes to be cured, but\nthat the father is the one most in need of treatment. At other times an\nunusual arrangement of words, or a forced expression, is sufficient to\ndisclose in the speech of the patient the participation of a repressed\nthought having a different motive.\nHence, in coarse as well as in finer speech disturbances, which may,\nnevertheless, be subsumed as \u201cspeech-blunders,\u201d I find that it is\nnot the contact effects of the sound, but the thoughts outside the\nintended speech, which determine the origin of the speech-blunder, and\nalso suffice to explain the newly formed mistakes in speech. I do not\ndoubt the laws whereby the sounds produce changes upon one another;\nbut they alone do not appear to me sufficiently forcible to mar the\ncorrect execution of speech. In those cases which I have studied\nand investigated more closely they merely represent the preformed\nmechanism, which is conveniently utilized by a more remote psychic\nmotive. The latter does not, however, form a part of the sphere of\ninfluence of these sound relations. _In a large number of substitutions\ncaused by mistakes in talking there is an entire absence of such\nphonetic laws._ In this respect I am in full accord with Wundt, who\nlikewise assumes that the conditions underlying speech-blunders are\ncomplex and go far beyond the contact effect of the sounds.\nIf I accept as certain \u201cthese more remote psychic influences,\u201d\nfollowing Wundt\u2019s expression, there is still nothing to detain me from\nconceding also that in accelerated speech, with a certain amount of\ndiverted attention, the causes of speech-blunder may be easily limited\nto the definite law of Meringer and Mayer. However, in a number of\nexamples gathered by these authors a more complicated solution is\nquite apparent.\nIn some forms of speech-blunders we may assume that the disturbing\nfactor is the result of striking against obscene words and meanings.\nThe purposive disfigurement and distortion of words and phrases,\nwhich is so popular with vulgar persons, aims at nothing else but the\nemploying of a harmless motive as a reminder of the obscene, and this\nsport is so frequent that it would not be at all remarkable if it\nappeared unintentionally and contrary to the will.\nI trust that the readers will not depreciate the value of these\ninterpretations, for which there is no proof, and of these examples\nwhich I have myself collected and explained by means of analysis. But\nif secretly I still cherish the expectation that even the apparently\nsimple cases of speech-blunder will be traced to a disturbance caused\nby a half-repressed idea outside of the intended context, I am tempted\nto it by a noteworthy observation of Meringer. This author asserts that\nit is remarkable that nobody wishes to admit having made a mistake in\nspeaking. There are many intelligent and honest people who are offended\nif we tell them that they made a mistake in speaking. I would not risk\nmaking this assertion as general as does Meringer, using the term\n\u201cnobody.\u201d But the emotional trace which clings to the demonstration\nof the mistake, which manifestly belongs to the nature of shame, has\nits significance. It may be classed with the anger displayed at the\ninability to recall a forgotten name, and with the surprise at the\ntenaciousness of an apparently indifferent memory, and it invariably\npoints to the participation of a motive in the formation of the\ndisturbance.\nThe distorting of names amounts to an insult when done intentionally,\nand could have the same significance in a whole series of cases\nwhere it appears as unintentional speech-blunders. The person who,\naccording to Mayer\u2019s report, once said \u201cFreuder\u201d instead of \u201cFreud,\u201d\nbecause shortly before he pronounced the name \u201cBreuer\u201d (p. 38), and\nwho at another time spoke of the \u201cFreuer-Breudian\u201d method (p. 28), was\ncertainly not particularly enthusiastic over this method. Later, under\nthe mistakes in writing, I shall report a case of name disfigurement\nwhich certainly admits of no other explanation.[20]\nAs a disturbing element in these cases there is an intermingling of a\ncriticism which must be omitted, because at the time being it does not\ncorrespond to the intention of the speaker.\nOr it may be just the reverse; the substituted name, or the adoption\nof the strange name, signifies an appreciation of the same. The\nidentification which is brought about by the mistake is equivalent\nto a recognition which for the moment must remain in the background.\nAn experience of this kind from his schooldays is related by Dr.\nFerenczi:--\n\u201cWhile in my first year at college I was obliged to recite a poem\nbefore the whole class. It was the first experience of the kind in my\nlife, but I was well prepared. As soon as I began my recitation I was\ndismayed at being disturbed by an outburst of laughter. The professor\nlater explained to me this strange reception. I started by giving the\ntitle \u2018From the Distance,\u2019 which was correct, but instead of giving the\nname of the real author, I mentioned--my own. The name of the poet is\nAlexander Pet\u00f6fi. The identity of the first name with my own favoured\nthe interchange of names, but the real reason was surely the fact that\nI identified myself at that time with the celebrated poet-hero. Even\nconsciously I entertained for him a love and respect which verged on\nadoration. The whole ambition-complex hides itself under this faulty\naction.\u201d\nA similar identification was reported to me concerning a young\nphysician who timidly and reverently introduced himself to the\ncelebrated Virchow with the following words: \u201cI am Dr. Virchow.\u201d\nThe surprised professor turned to him and asked, \u201cIs your name also\nVirchow?\u201d I do not know how the ambitious young man justified his\nspeech-blunder, whether he thought of the charming excuse that he\nimagined himself so insignificant next to this big man that his own\nname slipped from him, or whether he had the courage to admit that he\nhoped that he, too, would some day be as great a man as Virchow, and\nthat the professor should therefore not treat him in too disparaging a\nmanner. One or both of these thoughts may have put this young man in an\nembarrassing position during the introduction.\nOwing to very personal motives I must leave it undecided whether a\nsimilar interpretation may also apply in the case to be cited. At the\nInternational Congress in Amsterdam, in 1907, my theories of hysteria\nwere the subject of a lively discussion. One of my most violent\nopponents, in his diatribe against me, repeatedly made mistakes in\nspeech in such a manner that he put himself in my place and spoke in\nmy name. He said, for example, \u201cBreuer and I, as is well known, have\ndemonstrated,\u201d etc., when he wished to say \u201cBreuer and Freud.\u201d The name\nof this opponent does not show the slightest sound similarity to my\nown. From this example, as well as from other cases of interchanging\nnames in speech-blunders, we are reminded of the fact that the\nspeech-blunder can fully forego the facility afforded to it through\nsimilar sounds, and can achieve its purpose if only supported in\ncontent by concealed relations.\nIn other and more significant cases it is a self-criticism, an\ninternal contradiction against one\u2019s own utterance, which causes the\nspeech-blunder, and even forces a contrasting substitution for the one\nintended. We then observe with surprise how the wording of an assertion\nremoves the purpose of the same, and how the error in speech lays bare\nthe inner dishonesty. Here the _lapsus lingu\u00e6_ becomes a mimicking form\nof expression, often, indeed, for the expression of what one does not\nwish to say. It is thus a means of self-betrayal.\nBrill relates: \u201cI had recently been consulted by a woman who showed\nmany paranoid trends, and as she had no relatives who could co-operate\nwith me, I urged her to enter a State hospital as a voluntary patient.\nShe was quite willing to do so, but on the following day she told\nme that her friends with whom she leased an apartment objected to\nher going to a hospital, as it would interfere with their plans,\nand so on. I lost patience and said: \u2018There is no use listening to\nyour friends who know nothing about your mental condition; you are\nquite _incompetent_ to take care of your own affairs.\u2019 I meant to say\n\u2018competent.\u2019 Here the _lapsus lingu\u00e6_ expressed my true opinion.\u201d\nFavoured by chance the speech material often gives origin to examples\nof speech-blunders which serve to bring about an overwhelming\nrevelation or a full comic effect, as shown by the following examples\nreported by Brill:--\n\u201cA wealthy but not very generous host invited his friends for an\nevening dance. Everything went well until about 11.30 p.m., when there\nwas an intermission, presumably for supper. To the great disappointment\nof most of the guests there was no supper; instead, they were regaled\nwith thin sandwiches and lemonade. As it was close to Election day the\nconversation centred on the different candidates; and as the discussion\ngrew warmer, one of the guests, an ardent admirer of the Progressive\nParty candidate, remarked to the host: \u2018You may say what you please\nabout Teddy, but there is one thing--he can always be relied upon;\nhe always gives you a _square meal_,\u2019 wishing to say _square deal_.\nThe assembled guests burst into a roar of laughter, to the great\nembarrassment of the speaker and the host, who fully understood each\nother.\u201d\n\u201cWhile writing a prescription for a woman who was especially weighed\ndown by the financial burden of the treatment, I was interested to hear\nher say suddenly: \u2018Please do not give me _big bills_, because I cannot\nswallow them.\u2019 Of course she meant to say _pills_.\u201d\nThe following example illustrates a rather serious case of\nself-betrayal through a mistake in talking. Some accessory details\njustify full reproduction as first printed by Dr. A. A. Brill.[21]\n\u201cWhile walking one night with Dr. Frink we accidentally met a\ncolleague, Dr. P., whom I had not seen for years, and of whose private\nlife I knew nothing. We were naturally very pleased to meet again, and\non my invitation he accompanied us to a caf\u00e9, where we spent about two\nhours in pleasant conversation. To my question as to whether he was\nmarried he gave a negative answer, and added, \u2018Why should a man like me\nmarry?\u2019\n\u201cOn leaving the caf\u00e9, he suddenly turned to me and said: \u2018I should\nlike to know what you would do in a case like this: I know a nurse\nwho was named as co-respondent in a divorce case. The wife sued the\nhusband for divorce and named her as co-respondent, and _he_ got the\ndivorce.\u2019 I interrupted him, saying, \u2018You mean _she_ got the divorce.\u2019\nHe immediately corrected himself, saying, \u2018Yes, she got the divorce,\u2019\nand continued to tell how the excitement of the trial had affected this\nnurse to such an extent that she became nervous and took to drink. He\nwanted me to advise him how to treat her.\n\u201cAs soon as I had corrected his mistake I asked him to explain it, but,\nas is usually the case, he was surprised at my question. He wanted\nto know whether a person had no right to make mistakes in talking. I\nexplained to him that there is a reason for every mistake, and that if\nhe had not told me that he was unmarried, I would say that he was the\nhero of the divorce case in question, and that the mistake showed that\nhe wished he had obtained the divorce instead of his wife, so as not\nto be obliged to pay alimony and to be permitted to marry again in New\nYork State.\n\u201cHe stoutly denied my interpretation, but his emotional agitation,\nfollowed by loud laughter, only strengthened my suspicions. To my\nappeal that he should tell the truth \u2018for science\u2019 sake,\u2019 he said,\n\u2018Unless you wish me to lie you must believe that I was never married,\nand hence your psychoanalytic interpretation is all wrong.\u2019 He,\nhowever, added that it was dangerous to be with a person who paid\nattention to such little things. Then he suddenly remembered that he\nhad another appointment and left us.\n\u201cBoth Dr. Frink and I were convinced that my interpretation of his\n_lapsus lingu\u00e6_ was correct, and I decided to corroborate or disprove\nit by further investigation. The next day I found a neighbour and old\nfriend of Dr. P., who confirmed my interpretation in every particular.\nThe divorce was granted to Dr. P.\u2019s wife a few weeks before, and a\nnurse was named as co-respondent. A few weeks later I met Dr. P., and\nhe told me that he was thoroughly convinced of the Freudian mechanisms.\u201d\nThe self-betrayal is just as plain in the following case reported by\nOtto Rank:--\nA father who was devoid of all patriotic feeling and desirous of\neducating his children to be just as free from this superfluous\nsentiment, reproached his sons for participating in a patriotic\ndemonstration, and rejected their reference to a similar behaviour of\ntheir uncle with these words: \u201cYou are not obliged to imitate him;\nwhy, he is an _idiot_.\u201d The astonished features of the children at\ntheir father\u2019s unusual tone aroused him to the fact that he had made a\nmistake, and he remarked apologetically, \u201cOf course, I wished to say\n_patriot_.\u201d\nWhen such a speech-blunder occurs in a serious squabble and reverses\nthe intended meaning of one of the disputants, at once it puts him at a\ndisadvantage with his adversary--a disadvantage which the latter seldom\nfails to utilize.\nThis clearly shows that although people are unwilling to accept\nthe theory of my conception and are not inclined to forego the\nconvenience that is connected with the tolerance of a faulty action,\nthey nevertheless interpret speech-blunders and other faulty acts in\na manner similar to the one presented in this book. The merriment and\nderision which are sure to be evoked at the decisive moment through\nsuch linguistic mistakes speak conclusively against the generally\naccepted convention that such a speech-blunder is a _lapsus lingu\u00e6_\nand psychologically of no importance. It was no less a man than the\nGerman Chancellor, Prince B\u00fclow, who endeavoured to save the situation\nthrough such a protest when the wording of his defence of his Emperor\n(November, 1907) turned into the opposite through a speech-blunder.\n\u201cConcerning the present, the new epoch of Emperor Wilhelm II, I can\nonly repeat what I said a year ago, that _it would be unfair and unjust\nto speak of a coterie of responsible advisers around our Emperor_ (loud\ncalls, \u2018Irresponsible!\u2019)--to speak of _irresponsible_ advisers. Pardon\nthe _lapsus lingu\u00e6_\u201d (hilarity).\nA nice example of speech-blunder, which aims not so much at the\nbetrayal of the speaker as at the enlightenment of the listener outside\nthe scene, is found in Wallenstein (_Piccolomini_, Act I, Scene 5),\nand shows us that the poet who here uses this means is well versed in\nthe mechanism and intent of speech-blunders. In the preceding scene\nMax Piccolomini was passionately in favour of the ducal party, and was\nenthusiastic over the blessings of the peace which became known to him\nin the course of a journey while accompanying Wallenstein\u2019s daughter\nto the encampment. He leaves his father and the Court ambassador,\nQuestenberg, in great consternation. The scene proceeds as follows:--\nQUESTENBERG. Woe unto us! Are matters thus? Friend, should we allow\nhim to go there with this false opinion, and not recall him at once in\norder to open his eyes instantly.\nOCTAVIO (_rousing himself from profound meditation_). He has already\nopened mine, and I see more than pleases me.\nQUESTENBERG. What is it, friend?\nOCTAVIO. A curse on that journey!\nQUESTENBERG. Why? What is it?\nOCTAVIO. Come! I must immediately follow the unlucky trail, must see\nwith my own eyes--come----(_Wishes to lead him away._)\nQUESTENBERG. What is the matter? Where?\nOCTAVIO (_urging_). To _her_!\nQUESTENBERG. To----?\nOCTAVIO (_corrects himself_). To the duke! Let us go, etc.\nThe slight speech-blunder _to her_ in place of _to him_ is meant to\nbetray to us the fact that the father has seen through his son\u2019s motive\nfor espousing the other cause, while the courtier complains that \u201che\nspeaks to him altogether in riddles.\u201d\nAnother example wherein a poet makes use of a speech-blunder was\ndiscovered by Otto Rank in Shakespeare. I quote Rank\u2019s report from the\n_Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse_, I. 3.\n\u201cA poetic speech-blunder, very delicately motivated and technically\nremarkably well utilized, which, like the one pointed out by Freud in\nWallenstein (_Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens_, 2nd Edition, p.\n48), not only shows that poets knew the mechanism and sense of this\nerror, but also presupposes an understanding of it on the part of the\nhearer, can be found in Shakespeare\u2019s _Merchant of Venice_ (Act III,\nScene 2). By the will of her father, Portia was bound to select a\nhusband through a lottery. She escaped all her distasteful suitors by\nlucky chance. When she finally found in Bassanio the suitor after her\nown heart, she had cause to fear lest he, too, should draw the unlucky\nlottery. In the scene she would like to tell him that even if he chose\nthe wrong casket, he might, nevertheless, be sure of her love. But she\nis hampered by her vow. In this mental conflict the poet puts these\nwords in her mouth, which were directed to the welcome suitor:--\n\u201cThere is something tells me (but it is not love),\nI would not lose you; and you know yourself\nHate counsels not in such a quality.\nBut lest you should not understand me well\n(And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought),\nI would detain you here some month or two,\nBefore you venture for me. I could teach you\nHow to choose right, but then I am forsworn;\nSo will I never be; so may you miss me;\nBut if you do, you\u2019ll make me wish a sin,\nThat I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,\nThey have o\u2019erlooked me, and divided me:\n_One half of me is yours, the other half yours_--\n_Mine own, I would say_; but if mine, then yours--\nAnd so all yours.\u201d\n\u201cJust the very thing which she would like to hint to him gently,\nbecause really she should keep it from him, namely, that even before\nthe choice she is wholly his--that she loves him, the poet, with\nadmirable psychologic sensitiveness, allows to come to the surface in\nthe speech-blunder. It is through this artifice that he manages to\nallay the intolerable uncertainty of the lover as well as the like\ntension of the hearer concerning the outcome of the choice.\u201d\nThe interest merited by the confirmation of our conception of\nspeech-blunders through the great poets justifies the citation of a\nthird example which was reported by Dr. E. Jones.[22]\n\u201cOur great novelist, George Meredith, in his masterpiece, _The Egoist_,\nshows an even finer understanding of the mechanism. The plot of the\nnovel is, shortly, as follows: Sir Willoughby Patterne, an aristocrat\ngreatly admired by his circle, becomes engaged to a Miss Constantia\nDurham. She discovers in him an intense egoism, which he skilfully\nconceals from the world, and to escape the marriage she elopes with a\nCaptain Oxford. Some years later Patterne becomes engaged to a Miss\nClara Middleton, and most of the book is taken up with a detailed\ndescription of the conflict that arises in her mind on also discovering\nhis egoism. External circumstances and her conception of honour hold\nher to her pledge, while he becomes more and more distasteful in her\neyes. She partly confided in his cousin and secretary, Vernon Whitford,\nthe man whom she ultimately marries, but from a mixture of motives he\nstands aloof.\n\u201cIn the soliloquy Clara speaks as follows: \u2018If some noble gentleman\ncould see me as I am and not disdain to aid me! Oh! to be caught out of\nthis prison of thorns and brambles. I cannot tear my own way out. I am\na coward. A beckoning of a finger would change me, I believe. I could\nfly bleeding and through hootings to a comrade.... Constantia met a\nsoldier. Perhaps she prayed and her prayer was answered. She did ill.\nBut, oh, how I love her for it! His name was Harry Oxford.... She did\nnot waver, she cut the links, she signed herself over. Oh, brave girl,\nwhat do you think of me? But I have no Harry Whitford; I am alone....\u2019\nThe sudden consciousness that she had put another name for Oxford\nstruck her a buffet, drowning her in crimson.\n\u201cThe fact that both men\u2019s names end in \u2018ford\u2019 evidently renders the\nconfounding of them more easy, and would by many be regarded as an\nadequate cause for this, but the real underlying motive for it is\nplainly indicated by the author. In another passage the same _lapsus_\noccurs, and is followed by the hesitation and change of subject that\none is familiar with in psychoanalysis when a half-conscious complex\nis touched. Sir Willoughby patronizingly says of Whitford: \u2018False\nalarm. The resolution to do anything unaccustomed is quite beyond\npoor old Vernon.\u2019 Clara replies: \u2018But if Mr. Oxford--Whitford ...\nyour swans, coming sailing up the lake; how beautiful they look when\nthey are indignant! I was going to ask you, surely men witnessing a\nmarked admiration for some one else will naturally be discouraged?\u2019 Sir\nWilloughby stiffened with sudden enlightenment.\n\u201cIn still another passage Clara, by another _lapsus_, betrays her\nsecret wish that she was on a more intimate footing with Vernon\nWhitford. Speaking to a boy friend, she says, \u2018Tell Mr. Vernon--tell\nMr. Whitford.\u2019\u201d\nThe conception of speech-blunders here defended can be readily verified\nin the smallest details. I have been able to demonstrate repeatedly\nthat the most insignificant and most natural cases of speech-blunders\nhave their good sense, and admit of the same interpretation as the\nmore striking examples. A patient who, contrary to my wishes but\nwith firm personal motives, decided upon a short trip to Budapest,\njustified herself by saying that she was going for only three days, but\nshe blundered and said for only three weeks. She betrayed her secret\nfeeling that, to spite me, she preferred spending three weeks to three\ndays in that society which I considered unfit for her.\nOne evening, wishing to excuse myself for not having called for my wife\nat the theatre, I said: \u201cI was at the theatre at ten minutes after\nten.\u201d I was corrected: \u201cYou meant to say before ten o\u2019clock.\u201d Naturally\nI wanted to say before ten. After ten would certainly be no excuse. I\nhad been told that the theatre programme read, \u201cFinished before ten\no\u2019clock.\u201d When I arrived at the theatre I found the foyer dark and\nthe theatre empty. Evidently the performance was over earlier and my\nwife did not wait for me. When I looked at the clock it still wanted\nfive minutes to ten. I determined to make my case more favourable\nat home, and say that it was ten minutes to ten. Unfortunately, the\nspeech-blunder spoiled the intent and laid bare my dishonesty, in which\nI acknowledged more than there really was to confess.\nThis leads us to those speech disturbances which can no longer be\ndescribed as speech-blunders, for they do not injure the individual\nword, but affect the rhythm and execution of the entire speech, as,\nfor example, the stammering and stuttering of embarrassment. But here,\nas in the former cases, it is the inner conflict that is betrayed to\nus through the disturbance in speech. I really do not believe that any\none will make mistakes in talking in an audience with His Majesty,\nin a serious love declaration, or in defending one\u2019s name and honour\nbefore a jury; in short, people make no mistakes where _they are all\nthere_, as the saying goes. Even in criticizing an author\u2019s style we\nare allowed and accustomed to follow the principle of explanation,\nwhich we cannot miss in the origin of a single speech-blunder. A\nclear and unequivocal manner of writing shows us that here the author\nis in harmony with himself, but where we find a forced and involved\nexpression, aiming at more than one target, as appropriately expressed,\nwe can thereby recognize the participation of an unfinished and\ncomplicated thought, or we can hear through it the stifled voice of\nthe author\u2019s self-criticism.[23]\nVI\nMISTAKES IN READING AND WRITING\nThat the same view-points and observation should hold true for mistakes\nin reading and writing as for lapses in speech is not at all surprising\nwhen one remembers the inner relation of these functions. I shall here\nconfine myself to the reports of several carefully analysed examples\nand shall make no attempt to include all of the phenomena.\nA. LAPSES IN READING.\n(_a_) While looking over a number of the _Leipziger Illustrierten_,\nwhich I was holding obliquely, I read as the title of the front-page\npicture, \u201cA Wedding Celebration in the Odyssey.\u201d Astonished and with my\nattention aroused, I moved the page into the proper position only to\nread correctly, \u201cA Wedding Celebration in the Ostsee (Baltic Sea).\u201d How\ndid this senseless mistake in reading come about?\nImmediately my thoughts turned to a book by Ruth, _Experimental\nInvestigations of \u201cMusic Phantoms\u201d_, etc., with which I had recently\nbeen much occupied, as it closely touched the psychologic problems\nthat are of interest to me. The author promised a work in the near\nfuture to be called _Analysis and Principles of Dream Phenomena_. No\nwonder that I, having just published an _Interpretation of Dreams_,\nawaited the appearance of this book with the most intense interest. In\nRuth\u2019s work concerning music phantoms I found an announcement in the\nbeginning of the table of contents of the detailed inductive proof that\nthe old Hellenic myths and traditions originated mainly from slumber\nand music phantoms, from dream phenomena and from deliria. Thereupon I\nhad immediately plunged into the text in order to find out whether he\nwas also aware that the scene where Odysseus appears before Nausicaa\nwas based upon the common dream of nakedness. One of my friends\ncalled my attention to the clever passage in G. Keller\u2019s _Gr\u00fcnem\nHeinrich_, which explains this episode in the Odyssey as an objective\nrepresentation of the dream of the mariner straying far from home. I\nadded to it the reference to the exhibition dream of nakedness.[24]\n(_b_) A woman who is very anxious to get children always reads _storks_\ninstead of _stocks_.\n(_c_) One day I received a letter which contained very disturbing news.\nI immediately called my wife and informed her that poor Mrs. Wm. H.\nwas seriously ill and was given up by the doctors. There must have been\na false ring to the words in which I expressed my sympathy, as my wife\ngrew suspicious, asked to see the letter, and expressed her opinion\nthat it could not read as stated by me, because no one calls the wife\nby the husband\u2019s name. Moreover, the correspondent was well acquainted\nwith the Christian name of the woman concerned. I defended my assertion\nobstinately and referred to the customary visiting-cards, on which a\nwoman designates herself by the Christian name of her husband. I was\nfinally compelled to take up the letter, and, as a matter of fact, we\nread therein \u201cPoor W. M.\u201d What is more, I had even overlooked \u201cPoor Dr.\nW. M.\u201d My mistake in reading signified a spasmodic effort, so to speak,\nto turn the sad news from the man towards the woman. The title between\nthe adjective and the name did not go well with my claim that the woman\nmust have been meant. That is why it was omitted in the reading. The\nmotive for this falsifying was not that the woman was less an object\nof my sympathy than the man, but the fate of this poor man had excited\nmy fears regarding another and nearer person who, I was aware, had the\nsame disease.\n(_d_) Both irritating and laughable is a lapse in reading to which I am\nfrequently subject when I walk through the streets of a strange city\nduring my vacation. I then read _antiquities_ on every shop sign that\nshows the slightest resemblance to the word; this displays the questing\nspirit of the collector.\n(_e_) In his important work[25] Bleuler relates: \u201cWhile reading I\nonce had the intellectual feeling of seeing my name two lines below.\nTo my astonishment I found only the words blood corpuscles. Of the\nmany thousands of lapses in reading in the peripheral as well as in\nthe central field of vision that I have analysed, this was the most\nstriking case. Whenever I imagined that I saw my name, the word that\ninduced this illusion usually showed a greater resemblance to my name\nthan the word _bloodcorpuscles_. In most cases all the letters of my\nname had to be close together before I could commit such an error. In\nthis case, however, I could readily explain the delusion of reference\nand the illusion. What I had just read was the end of a statement\nconcerning a form of bad style in scientific works, a tendency from\nwhich I am not entirely free.\u201d\nB. LAPSES IN WRITING.\n(_a_) On a sheet of paper containing principally short daily notes\nof business interest, I found, to my surprise, the incorrect date,\n\u201cThursday, October 20th,\u201d bracketed under the correct date of the\nmonth of September. It was not difficult to explain this anticipation\nas the expression of a wish. A few days before I had returned fresh\nfrom my vacation and felt ready for any amount of professional work,\nbut as yet there were few patients. On my arrival I had found a letter\nfrom a patient announcing her arrival on the 20th of October. As I\nwrote the same date in September I may certainly have thought \u201cX. ought\nto be here already; what a pity about that whole month!\u201d and with this\nthought I pushed the current date a month ahead. In this case the\ndisturbing thought can scarcely be called unpleasant; therefore after\nnoticing this lapse in writing, I immediately knew the solution. In\nthe fall of the following year I experienced an entirely analogous\nand similarly motivated lapse in writing. E. Jones has made a study\nof similar cases, and found that most mistakes in writing dates are\nmotivated.\n(_b_) I received the proof sheets of my contribution to the annual\nreport on neurology and psychiatry, and I was naturally obliged to\nreview with special care the names of authors, which, because of\nthe many different nationalities represented, offer the greatest\ndifficulties to the compositor. As a matter of fact, I found some\nstrange-sounding names still in need of correction; but, oddly enough,\nthe compositor had corrected one single name in my manuscript,\nand with very good reason. I had written _Buckrhard_, which the\ncompositor guessed to be _Burckhard_. I had praised the treatise of\nthis obstetrician entitled _The Influence of Birth on the Origin of\nInfantile Paralysis_, and I was not conscious of the least enmity\ntoward him. But an author in Vienna, who had angered me by an adverse\ncriticism of my _Traumdeutung_, bears the same name. It was as if in\nwriting the name Burckhard, meaning the obstetrician, a wicked thought\nconcerning the other B. had obtruded itself. The twisting of the name,\nas I have already stated in regard to lapses in speech, often signifies\na depreciation.[26]\n(_c_) The following is seemingly a serious case of _lapsus calami_,\nwhich it would be equally correct to describe as an erroneously carried\nout action. I intended to withdraw from the postal savings bank the sum\nof 300 crowns, which I wished to send to an absent relative to enable\nhim to take treatment at a watering-place. I noted that my account was\n4,380 crowns, and I decided to bring it down to the round sum of 4,000\ncrowns, which was not to be touched in the near future. After making\nout the regular cheque I suddenly noticed that I had written not 380\ncrowns, as I had intended, but exactly 438 crowns. I was frightened\nat the untrustworthiness of my action. I soon realized that my fear\nwas groundless, as I had not grown poorer than I was before. But I\nhad to reflect for quite a while in order to discover what influence\ndiverted me from my first intention without making itself known to my\nconsciousness.\nFirst I got on a wrong track: I subtracted 380 from 438, but after that\nI did not know what to do with the difference. Finally an idea occurred\nto me which showed me the true connection. 438 is exactly 10 per cent.\nof the entire account of 4,380 crowns! But the bookseller, too, gives a\n10 per cent. discount! I recalled that a few days before I had selected\nseveral books, in which I was no longer interested, in order to offer\nthem to the bookseller for 300 crowns. He thought the price demanded\ntoo high, but promised to give me a final answer within the next few\ndays. If he should accept my first offer he would replace the exact sum\nthat I was to spend on the sufferer. There is no doubt that I was sorry\nabout this expenditure. The emotion at the realization of my mistakes\ncan be more easily understood as a fear of growing poor through such\noutlays. But both the sorrow over this expense and the fear of poverty\nconnected with it were entirely foreign to my consciousness; I did not\nregret this expense when I promised the sum, and would have laughed\nat the idea of any such underlying motive. I should probably not have\nassigned such feelings to myself had not my psychoanalytic practice\nmade me quite familiar with the repressed elements of psychic life, and\nif I had not had a dream a few days before which brought forth the same\nsolution.\n(_d_) Although it is usually difficult to find the person responsible\nfor printers\u2019 errors, the psychologic mechanisms underlying them\nare the same as in other mistakes. Typographical errors also well\ndemonstrate the fact that people are not at all indifferent to such\ntrivialities as \u201cmistakes,\u201d and, judging by the indignant reactions of\nthe parties concerned, one is forced to the conclusion that mistakes\nare not treated by the public at large as mere accidents. This state\nof affairs is very well summed up in the following editorial from the\n_New York Times_ of April 14, 1913. Not the least interesting are the\ncomments of the keen-witted editor, who seems to share our views:--\n\u201cA BLUNDER TRULY UNFORTUNATE.\n\u201cTypographical errors come only too frequently from even the\nbest-regulated newspaper presses. They are always humiliating, often\na cause of anger, and occasionally dangerous, but now and then they\nare distinctly amusing. This latter quality they are most apt to have\nwhen they are made in the office of a journalistic neighbour, a fact\nthat probably explains why we can read with smiling composure an\nelaborate editorial apology which appears in the _Hartford Courant_.\n\u201cIts able political commentator tried the other day to say that,\n_unfortunately_ for Connecticut, \u2018J. H. is no longer a Member of\nCongress. Printer and proof-reader combined to deprive the adverb of\nits negative particle.\u2019 At least, the able political commentator so\ndeclares, and we wouldn\u2019t question his veracity for the world; but\nsorrowful experience has taught most of us that it\u2019s safer to get\nthat sort of editorial disclaimer of responsibility into print before\nlooking up the copy, and perhaps--just perhaps--the world-enlightener,\nwho _knows_ that he wrote _unfortunate_, because that is what he\nintended to write, didn\u2019t rashly chance the discovery of his own guilt\nbefore he convicted the composing-room of it.\n\u201cBe that as it may, the meaning of the sentence was cruelly changed,\nand a friend was grieved or offended. Not so long ago a more\nastonishing error than this one crept into a book review of ours--a\nvery solemn and scientific book. It consisted of the substitution\nof the word \u2018caribou\u2019 for the word \u2018carbon\u2019 in a paragraph dealing\nwith the chemical composition of the stars. In that case the writer\u2019s\nfierce self-exculpation is at least highly plausible, as it seems\nhardly possible that he wrote \u2018caribou\u2019 when he intended to write\n\u2018carbon,\u2019 but even he was cautious enough to make no deep inquiry into\nthe matter.\u201d\n(_e_) I cite the following case contributed by Dr. W. Stekel, for\nthe authenticity of which I can vouch: \u201cAn almost unbelievable\nexample of miswriting and misreading occurred in the editing of a\nwidely circulated weekly. It concerned an article of defence and\nvindication which was written with much warmth and great pathos. The\neditor-in-chief of the paper read the article, while the author himself\nnaturally read it from the manuscript and proof-sheets more than once.\nEverybody was satisfied, when the printer\u2019s reader suddenly noticed\na slight error which had escaped the attention of all. There it was,\nplainly enough: \u2018Our readers will bear witness to the fact that we have\nalways acted in a _selfish_ manner for the good of the community.\u2019\nIt is quite evident that it was meant to read _unselfish_. The real\nthoughts, however, broke through the pathetic speech with elemental\nforce.\u201d\n(_f_) The following example of misprinting is taken from a Western\ngazette: The teacher was giving an instruction paper on mathematical\nmethods, and spoke of a plan \u201cfor the instruction of youth that might\nbe carried out _ad libidinem_.\u201d\n(_g_) Even the Bible did not escape misprints. Thus we have the \u201cWicked\nBible,\u201d so called from the fact that the negative was left out of the\nseventh commandment. This authorized edition of the Bible was published\nin London in 1631, and it is said that the printer had to pay a fine of\ntwo thousand pounds for the omission.\nAnother biblical misprint dates back to the year 1580, and is found\nin the Bible of the famous library of Wolfenbuttel, in Hesse. In the\npassage in Genesis where God tells Eve that Adam shall be her master\nand shall rule over her, the German translation is \u201c_Und er soll dein\nHerr sein_.\u201d The word _Herr_ (master) was substituted by _Narr_, which\nmeans fool. Newly discovered evidence seems to show that the error was\na conscious machination of the printer\u2019s suffragette wife, who refused\nto be ruled by her husband.\n(_h_) Dr. Ernest Jones reports the following case concerning A. A.\nBrill: \u201cAlthough by custom almost a teetotaler, he yielded to a\nfriend\u2019s importunity one evening, in order to avoid offending him,\nand took a little wine. During the next morning an exacerbation of an\neye-strain headache gave him cause to regret this slight indulgence,\nand his reflection on the subject found expression in the following\nslip of the pen. Having occasion to write the name of a girl mentioned\nby a patient, he wrote not Ethel but Ethyl.[27] It happened that the\ngirl in question was rather too fond of drink, and in Dr. Brill\u2019s mood\nat the time this characteristic of hers stood out with conspicuous\nsignificance.\u201d[28]\n(_i_) A woman wrote to her sister, felicitating her on the occasion\nof taking possession of a new and spacious residence. A friend who\nwas present noticed that the writer put the wrong address on the\nletter, and what was still more remarkable was the fact that she did\nnot address it to the previous residence, but to one long ago given\nup, but which her sister had occupied when she first married. When\nthe friend called her attention to it the writer remarked, \u201cYou are\nright; but what in the world made me do this?\u201d to which her friend\nreplied: \u201cPerhaps you begrudge her the nice big apartment into which\nshe has just moved because you yourself are cramped for space, and\nfor that reason you put her back into her first residence, where she\nwas no better off than yourself.\u201d \u201cOf course I begrudge her the new\napartment,\u201d she honestly admitted. As an afterthought she added, \u201cIt is\na pity that one is so mean in such matters.\u201d\n(_k_) Ernest Jones reports the following example given to him by Dr.\nA. A. Brill. In a letter to Dr. Brill a patient tried to attribute\nhis nervousness to business worries and excitement during the cotton\ncrisis. He went on to say: \u201cMy trouble is all due to that d---- frigid\nwave; there isn\u2019t even any seed to be obtained for new crops.\u201d He\nreferred to a cold wave which had destroyed the cotton crops, but\ninstead of writing \u201cwave\u201d he wrote \u201cwife.\u201d In the bottom of his heart\nhe entertained reproaches against his wife on account of her marital\nfrigidity and childlessness, and he was not far from the cognition that\nthe enforced abstinence played no little part in the causation of his\nmalady.\nOmissions in writing are naturally explained in the same manner as\nmistakes in writing. A remarkable example of omission which is of\nhistoric importance was reported by Dr. B. Dattner.[29] In one of\nthe legal articles dealing with the financial obligations of both\ncountries, which was drawn up in the year 1867 during the readjustment\nbetween Austria and Hungary, the word \u201ceffective\u201d was accidentally\nomitted in the Hungarian translation. Dattner thinks it probable that\nthe unconscious desire of the Hungarian law-makers to grant Austria the\nleast possible advantages had something to do with this omission.\nAnother example of omission is the following related by Brill:\n\u201cA prospective patient, who had corresponded with me relative to\ntreatment, finally wrote for an appointment for a certain day. Instead\nof keeping his appointment he sent regrets which began as follows:\n\u2018Owing to _foreseen_ circumstances I am unable to keep my appointment.\u2019\nHe naturally meant to write _unforeseen_. He finally came to me\nmonths later, and in the course of the analysis I discovered that\nmy suspicions at the time were justified; there were no unforeseen\ncircumstances to prevent his coming at that time; he was advised not to\ncome to me. The unconscious does not lie.\u201d\nWundt gives a most noteworthy proof for the easily ascertained fact\nthat we more easily make mistakes in writing than in speaking (_loc.\ncit._, p. 374). He states: \u201cIn the course of normal conversation the\ninhibiting function of the will is constantly directed toward bringing\ninto harmony the course of ideation with the movement of articulation.\nIf the articulation following the ideas becomes retarded through\nmechanical causes, as in writing, such anticipations then readily make\ntheir appearance.\u201d\nObservation of the determinants which favour lapses in reading gives\nrise to doubt, which I do not like to leave unmentioned, because I am\nof the opinion that it may become the starting-point of a fruitful\ninvestigation. It is a familiar fact that in reading aloud the\nattention of the reader often wanders from the text and is directed\ntoward his own thoughts. The results of this deviation of attention\nare often such that when interrupted and questioned he cannot even\nstate what he has read. In other words, he has read automatically,\nalthough the reading was nearly always correct. I do not think that\nsuch conditions favour any noticeable increase in the mistakes. We are\naccustomed to assume concerning a whole series of functions that they\nare most precisely performed when done automatically, with scarcely\nany conscious attention. This argues that the conditions governing\nattention in mistakes in speaking, writing, and reading must be\ndifferently determined than assumed by Wundt (cessation or diminution\nof attention). The examples which we have subjected to analysis have\nreally not given us the right to take for granted a quantitative\ndiminution of attention. We found what is probably not exactly the\nsame thing, a disturbance of the attention through a strange obtruding\nthought.\nVII\nFORGETTING OF IMPRESSIONS AND RESOLUTIONS\nIf any one should be inclined to overrate the state of our present\nknowledge of mental life, all that would be needed to force him to\nassume a modest attitude would be to remind him of the function of\nmemory. No psychologic theory has yet been able to account for the\nconnection between the fundamental phenomena of remembering and\nforgetting; indeed, even the complete analysis of that which one can\nactually observe has as yet scarcely been grasped. To-day forgetting\nhas perhaps grown more puzzling than remembering, especially since\nwe have learned from the study of dreams and pathologic states that\neven what for a long time we believed forgotten may suddenly return to\nconsciousness.\nTo be sure, we are in possession of some view-points which we hope\nwill receive general recognition. Thus we assume that forgetting is\na spontaneous process to which we may ascribe a certain temporal\ndischarge. We emphasize the fact that, just as among the units of\nevery impression or experience, in forgetting, too, a certain selection\ntakes place among the existing impressions. We are acquainted with some\nof the conditions that underlie the tenaciousness of memory and the\nawakening of that which would otherwise remain forgotten. Nevertheless,\nwe can observe in innumerable cases of daily life how unreliable and\nunsatisfactory our knowledge of the mechanism is. Thus we may listen\nto two persons exchanging reminiscences concerning the same outward\nimpressions, say of a journey that they have taken together some time\nbefore. What remains most firmly in the memory of the one is often\nforgotten by the other, as if it had never occurred, even when there\nis not the slightest reason to assume that this impression is of\ngreater psychic importance for the one than for the other. A great many\nof those factors which determine the selective power of memory are\nobviously still beyond our ken.\nWith the purpose of adding some small contribution to the knowledge of\nthe conditions of forgetting, I was wont to subject to a psychologic\nanalysis those cases in which forgetting concerned me personally. As\na rule I took up only a certain group of those cases, namely, those\nin which the forgetting astonished me, because, in my opinion, I\nshould have remembered the experience in question. I wish further to\nremark that I am generally not inclined to forgetfulness (of things\nexperienced, not of things learned), and that for a short period of my\nyouth I was able to perform extraordinary feats of memory. When I was a\nschoolboy it was quite natural for me to be able to repeat from memory\nthe page of a book which I had read; and shortly before I entered the\nUniversity I could write down practically verbatim the popular lectures\non scientific subjects directly after hearing them. In the tension\nbefore the final medical examination I must have made use of the\nremnant of this ability, for in certain subjects I gave the examiners\napparently automatic answers, which proved to be exact reproductions\nof the text-book, which I had skimmed through but once and then in\ngreatest haste.\nSince those days I have steadily lost control over my memory; of\nlate, however, I became convinced that with the aid of a certain\nartifice I can recall far more than I would otherwise credit myself\nwith remembering. For example, when, during my office hours, a patient\nstates that I have seen him before and I cannot recall either the fact\nor the time, then I help myself by guessing--that is, I allow a number\nof years, beginning from the present time, to come to my mind quickly.\nWhenever this could be controlled by records of definite information\nfrom the patient, it was always shown that in over ten years[30] I\nhave seldom missed it by more than six months. The same thing happens\nwhen I meet a casual acquaintance and, from politeness, inquire about\nhis small child. When he tells of its progress I try to fancy how\nold the child now is. I control my estimate by the information given\nby the father, and at most I make a mistake of a month, and in older\nchildren of three months. I cannot state, however, what basis I have\nfor this estimate. Of late I have grown so bold that I always offer my\nestimate spontaneously, and still run no risk of grieving the father by\ndisplaying my ignorance in regard to his offspring. Thus I extend my\nconscious memory by invoking my larger unconscious memory.\nI shall report some _striking_ examples of forgetting which for the\nmost part I have observed in myself. I distinguish forgetting of\nimpressions and experiences, that is, the forgetting of knowledge, from\nforgetting of resolutions, that is, the forgetting of omissions. The\nuniform result of the entire series of observations I can formulate\nas follows: _The forgetting in all cases is proved to be founded on a\nmotive of displeasure._\nA. FORGETTING OF IMPRESSIONS AND KNOWLEDGE.\n(_a_) During the summer my wife once made me very angry, although\nthe cause in itself was trifling. We sat in a restaurant opposite a\ngentleman from Vienna whom I knew, and who had cause to know me, and\nwhose acquaintance I had reasons for not wishing to renew. My wife,\nwho had heard nothing to the disrepute of the man opposite her, showed\nby her actions that she was listening to his conversation with his\nneighbours, for from time to time she asked me questions which took\nup the thread of their discussion. I became impatient and finally\nirritated. A few weeks later I complained to a relative about this\nbehaviour on the part of my wife, but I was not able to recall even\na single word of the conversation of the gentleman in the case. As I\nam usually rather resentful and cannot forget a single incident of an\nepisode that has annoyed me, my amnesia in this case was undoubtedly\ndetermined by respect for my wife.\nA short time ago I had a similar experience. I wished to make merry\nwith an intimate friend over a statement made by my wife only a few\nhours earlier, but I found myself hindered by the noteworthy fact that\nI had entirely forgotten the statement. I had first to beg my wife to\nrecall it to me. It is easy to understand that my forgetting in this\ncase may be analogous to the typical disturbance of judgment which\ndominates us when it concerns those nearest to us.\n(_b_) To oblige a woman who was a stranger in Vienna I had undertaken\nto procure a small iron safe for the preservation of documents and\nmoney. When I offered my services, the image of an establishment in\nthe heart of the city where I was sure I had seen such safes floated\nbefore me with extraordinary visual vividness. To be sure, I could\nnot recall the name of the street, but I felt certain that I would\ndiscover the store in a walk through the city, for my memory told me\nthat I had passed it countless times. To my chagrin I could not find\nthis establishment with the safes, though I walked through the inner\npart of the city in every direction. I concluded that the only thing\nleft to do was to search through a business directory, and if that\nfailed, to try to identify the establishment in a second round of the\ncity. It did not, however, require so much effort; among the addresses\nin the directory I found one which immediately presented itself as\nthat which had been forgotten. It was true that I had passed the show\nwindow countless times, each time, however, when I had gone to visit\nthe M. family, who have lived a great many years in this identical\nbuilding. After this intimate friendship had turned to an absolute\nestrangement, I had taken care to avoid the neighbourhood as well as\nthe house, though without ever thinking of the reason for my action. In\nmy walk through the city searching for the safe in the show window I\nhad traversed every street in the neighbourhood but the right one, and\nI had avoided this as if it were forbidden ground.\nThe motive of displeasure which was at the bottom of my disorientation\nis thus comprehensible. But the mechanism of forgetting is no longer so\nsimple as in the former example. Here my aversion naturally does not\nextend to the vendor of safes, but to another person, concerning whom\nI wish to know nothing, and later transfers itself from the latter to\nthis incident where it brings about the forgetting. Similarly, in the\ncase of _Burckhard_ mentioned above, the grudge against the one brought\nabout the error in writing the name of the other. The similarity of\nnames which here established a connection between two essentially\ndifferent streams of thought was accomplished in the showcase window\ninstance by the contiguity of space and the inseparable environment.\nMoreover, this latter case was more closely knit together, for money\nplayed a great part in the causation of the estrangement from the\nfamily living in this house.\n(_c_) The B. and R. Company requested me to pay a professional call\non one of their officers. On my way to him I was engrossed in the\nthought that I must already have been in the building occupied by the\nfirm. It seemed as if I used to see their signboard in a lower story\nwhile my professional visit was taking me to a higher story. I could\nnot recall, however, which house it was nor when I had called there.\nAlthough the entire matter was indifferent and of no consequence, I\nnevertheless occupied myself with it, and at last learned in the usual\nroundabout way, by collecting the thoughts that occurred to me in this\nconnection, that one story above the floor occupied by the firm B. and\nR. was the _Pension Fischer_, where I had frequently visited patients.\nThen I remembered the building which sheltered both the company and the\n_pension_.\nI was still puzzled, however, as to the motive that entered into\nplay in this forgetting. I found nothing disagreeable in my memory\nconcerning the firm itself or the _Pension Fischer_, or the patients\nliving there. I was also aware that it could not deal with anything\nvery painful, otherwise I hardly would have been successful in tracing\nthe thing forgotten in a roundabout way without resorting to external\naid, as happened in the preceding example. Finally it occurred to me\nthat a little before, while starting on my way to a new patient, a\ngentleman whom I had difficulty in recalling greeted me in the street.\nSome months previously I had seen this man in an apparently serious\ncondition and had made the diagnosis of general paresis, but later\nI had learned of his recovery, consequently my judgment had been\nincorrect. Was it not possible that we had in this case a remission,\nwhich one usually finds in _dementia paralytica_? In that contingency\nmy diagnosis would still be justified. The influence emanating from\nthis meeting caused me to forget the neighbourhood of the B. and\nR. Company, and my interest to discover the thing forgotten was\ntransferred from this case of disputed diagnosis. But the associative\nconnection in this loose inner relation was effected by means of a\nsimilarity of names: the man who recovered, contrary to expectation,\nwas also an officer of a large company that recommends patients to me.\nAnd the physician with whom I had seen the supposed paretic bore the\nname of Fischer, the name of the _pension_ in the house which I had\nforgotten.\n(_d_) Mislaying a thing really has the same significance as forgetting\nwhere we have placed it. Like most people delving in pamphlets and\nbooks, I am well oriented about my desk, and can produce what I want\nwith one lunge. What appears to others as disorder has become for\nme perfect order. Why, then, did I mislay a catalogue which was\nsent to me not long ago so that it could not be found? What is more,\nit had been my intention to order a book which I found announced\ntherein, entitled _Ueber die Sprache_, because it was written by an\nauthor whose spirited, vivacious style I like, whose insight into\npsychology and whose knowledge of the cultural world I have learned\nto appreciate. I believe that was just why I mislaid the catalogue.\nIt was my habit to lend the books of this author among my friends for\ntheir enlightenment, and a few days before, on returning one, somebody\nhad said: \u201cHis style reminds me altogether of yours, and his way of\nthinking is identical.\u201d The speaker did not know what he was stirring\nup with this remark. Years ago, when I was younger and in greater need\nof forming alliances, I was told practically the same thing by an\nolder colleague, to whom I had recommended the writings of a familiar\nmedical author. To put it in his words, \u201cIt is absolutely your style\nand manner.\u201d I was so influenced by these remarks that I wrote a letter\nto this author with the object of bringing about a closer relation, but\na rather cool answer put me back \u201cin my place.\u201d Perhaps still earlier\ndiscouraging experiences conceal themselves behind this last one,\nfor I did not find the mislaid catalogue. Through this premonition I\nwas actually prevented from ordering the advertised book, although\nthe disappearance of the catalogue formed no real hindrance, as I\nremembered well both the name of the book and the author.\n(_e_) Another case of mislaying merits our interest on account of\nthe conditions under which the mislaid object was rediscovered. A\nyounger man narrates as follows: \u201cSeveral years ago there were some\nmisunderstandings between me and my wife. I found her too cold, and\nthough I fully appreciated her excellent qualities, we lived together\nwithout evincing any tenderness for each other. One day on her return\nfrom a walk she gave me a book which she had bought because she thought\nit would interest me. I thanked her for this mark of \u2018attention,\u2019\npromised to read the book, put it away, and did not find it again. So\nmonths passed, during which I occasionally remembered the lost book,\nand also tried in vain to find it.\n\u201cAbout six months later my beloved mother, who was not living with\nus, became ill. My wife left home to nurse her mother-in-law. The\npatient\u2019s condition became serious and gave my wife the opportunity\nto show the best side of herself. One evening I returned home full of\nenthusiasm over what my wife had accomplished, and felt very grateful\nto her. I stepped to my desk and, without definite intention but with\nthe certainty of a somnambulist, I opened a certain drawer, and in the\nvery top of it I found the long-missing, mislaid book.\u201d\nThe following example of \u201cmisplacing\u201d belongs to a type well known to\nevery psychoanalyst. I must add that the patient who experienced this\nmisplacing has himself found the solution of it.\nThis patient, whose psychoanalytic treatment had to be interrupted\nthrough the summer vacation when he was in a state of resistance and\nill-health, put away his keys in the evening in their usual place, or\nso he thought. He then remembered that he wished to take some things\nfrom his desk, where he also had put the money which he needed on the\njourney. He was to depart the next day, which was the last day of\ntreatment and the date when the doctor\u2019s fee was due. But the keys had\ndisappeared.\nHe began a thorough and systematic search through his small apartment.\nHe became more and more excited over it, but his search was\nunsuccessful. As he recognized this \u201cmisplacement\u201d as a symptomatic\nact--that is, as being intentional--he aroused his servant in order\nto continue his search with the help of an \u201cunprejudiced\u201d person.\nAfter another hour he gave up the search and feared that he had lost\nthe keys. The next morning he ordered new keys from the desk factory,\nwhich were hurriedly made for him. Two acquaintances who had been with\nhim in a cab even recalled hearing something fall to the ground as he\nstepped out of the cab, and he was therefore convinced that the keys\nhad slipped from his pocket. They were found lying between a thick book\nand a thin pamphlet, the latter a work of one of my pupils, which he\nwished to take along as reading matter for his vacation; and they were\nso skilfully placed that no one would have supposed that they were\nthere. He himself was unable to replace the keys in such a position as\nto render them invisible. The unconscious skill with which an object\nis misplaced on account of secret but strong motives reminds one of\n\u201csomnambulistic sureness.\u201d The motive was naturally ill-humour over the\ninterruption of the treatment and the secret rage over the fact that he\nhad to pay such a high fee when he felt so ill.\n(_f_) Brill relates:[31] \u201cA man was urged by his wife to attend a\nsocial function in which he really took no interest. Yielding to his\nwife\u2019s entreaties, he began to take his dress-suit from the trunk when\nhe suddenly thought of shaving. After accomplishing this he returned to\nthe trunk and found it locked. Despite a long, earnest search the key\ncould not be found. A locksmith could not be found on Sunday evening,\nso that the couple had to send their regrets. On having the trunk\nopened the next morning the lost key was found within. The husband had\nabsent-mindedly dropped the key into the trunk and sprung the lock. He\nassured me that this was wholly unintentional and unconscious, but we\nknow that he did not wish to go to this social affair. The mislaying of\nthe key therefore lacked no motive.\u201d\nErnest Jones noticed in himself that he was in the habit of mislaying\nhis pipe whenever he suffered from the effects of over-smoking. The\npipe was then found in some unusual place where it did not belong and\nwhich it normally did not occupy.\nIf one looks over the cases of mislaying it will be difficult to assume\nthat mislaying is anything other than the result of an unconscious\nintention.\n(_g_) In the summer of 1901 I once remarked to a friend with whom I\nwas then actively engaged in exchanging ideas on scientific questions:\n\u201cThese neurotic problems can be solved only if we take the position of\nabsolutely accepting an original bi-sexuality in every individual.\u201d To\nwhich he replied: \u201cI told you that two and a half years ago while we\nwere taking an evening walk in Br. At that time you wouldn\u2019t listen to\nit.\u201d\nIt is truly painful to be thus requested to renounce one\u2019s originality.\nI could neither recall such a conversation nor my friend\u2019s revelation.\nOne of us must be mistaken; and according to the principle of the\nquestion _cui prodest_? I must be the one. Indeed, in the course of\nthe following weeks everything came back to me just as my friend had\nrecalled it. I myself remembered that at that time I gave the answer:\n\u201cI have not yet got so far, and I do not care to discuss it.\u201d But since\nthis incident I have grown more tolerant when I miss any mention of my\nname in medical literature in connection with ideas for which I deserve\ncredit.\nIt is scarcely accidental that the numerous examples of forgetting\nwhich have been collected without any selection should require for\ntheir solution the introduction of such painful themes as exposing of\none\u2019s wife; a friendship that has turned into the opposite; a mistake\nin medical diagnosis; enmity on account of similar pursuits, or the\nborrowing of somebody\u2019s ideas. I am rather inclined to believe that\nevery person who will undertake an inquiry into the motives underlying\nhis forgetting will be able to fill up a similar sample card of\nvexatious circumstances. The tendency to forget the disagreeable seems\nto me to be quite general; the capacity for it is naturally differently\ndeveloped in different persons. Certain _denials_ which we encounter\nin medical practice can probably be ascribed to _forgetting_.[32] Our\nconception of such forgetting confines the distinction between this and\nthat behaviour to purely psychologic relations, and permits us to see\nin both forms of reaction the expression of the same motive. Of the\nnumerous examples of denials of unpleasant recollection which I have\nobserved in kinsmen of patients, one remains in my memory as especially\nsingular.\nA mother telling me of the childhood of her nervous son, now in his\npuberty, made the statement that, like his brothers and sisters, he\nwas subject to bed-wetting throughout his childhood, a symptom which\ncertainly has some significance in a history of a neurotic patient.\nSome weeks later, while seeking information regarding the treatment, I\nhad occasion to call her attention to signs of a constitutional morbid\npredisposition in the young man, and at the same time referred to the\nbed-wetting recounted in the anamnesis. To my surprise she contested\nthis fact concerning him, denying it as well for the other children,\nand asked me how I could possibly know this. Finally I let her know\nthat she herself had told me a short time before what she had thus\nforgotten.[33]\nOne also finds abundant indications which show that even in healthy,\nnot neurotic, persons resistances are found against the memory of\ndisagreeable impressions and the idea of painful thoughts.[34] But the\nfull significance of this fact can be estimated only when we enter\ninto the psychology of neurotic persons. One is forced to make such\nelementary defensive striving against ideas which can awaken painful\nfeelings, a striving which can be put side by side only with the\nflight-reflex in painful stimuli, as the main pillar of the mechanism\nwhich carries the hysterical symptoms. One need not offer any objection\nto the acceptance of such defensive tendency on the ground that we\nfrequently find it impossible to rid ourselves of painful memories\nwhich cling to us, or to banish such painful emotions as remorse and\nreproaches of conscience. No one maintains that this defensive tendency\ninvariably gains the upper hand, that in the play of psychic forces it\nmay not strike against factors which stir up the contrary feeling for\nother purposes and bring it about in spite of it.\n_As the architectural principle of the psychic apparatus we may\nconjecture a certain stratification or structure of instances deposited\nin strata._ And it is quite possible that this defensive tendency\nbelongs to a lower psychic instance, and is inhibited by higher\ninstances. At all events, it speaks for the existence and force of\nthis defensive tendency, when we can trace it to processes such as\nthose found in our examples of forgetting. We see then that something\nis forgotten for its own sake, and where this is not possible the\ndefensive tendency misses the target and causes something else to\nbe forgotten--something less significant, but which has fallen into\nassociative connection with the disagreeable material.\nThe views here developed, namely, that painful memories merge into\nmotivated forgetting with special ease, merits application in many\nspheres where as yet it has found no, or scarcely any, recognition.\nThus it seems to me that it has not yet been strongly enough emphasized\nin the estimation of testimony taken in court,[35] where the putting\nof a witness under oath obviously leads us to place too great a\ntrust on the purifying influence of his psychic play of forces. It\nis universally admitted that in the origin of the traditions and\nfolklore of a people care must be taken to eliminate from memory\nsuch a motive as would be painful to the national feeling. Perhaps\non closer investigation it may be possible to form a perfect analogy\nbetween the manner of development of national traditions and infantile\nreminiscences of the individual. The great Darwin has formulated a\n\u201cgolden rule\u201d for the scientific worker from his insight into this\npain-motive of forgetting.[36]\nAlmost exactly as in the forgetting of names, faulty recollections can\nalso appear in the forgetting of impressions, and when finding credence\nthey may be designated as delusions of memory. The memory disturbance\nin pathologic cases (in paranoia it actually plays the r\u00f4le of a\nconstituting factor in the formation of delusions) has brought to light\nan extensive literature in which there is no reference whatever to its\nbeing motivated. As this theme also belongs to the psychology of the\nneuroses it goes beyond our present treatment. Instead, I will give\nfrom my own experience a curious example of memory disturbance showing\nclearly enough its determination through unconscious repressed material\nand its connection with this material.\nWhile writing the latter chapters of my volume on the interpretation\nof dreams, I happened to be in a summer resort without access to\nlibraries and reference books, so that I was compelled to introduce\ninto the manuscript all kinds of references and citations from memory.\nThese I naturally reserved for future correction. In the chapter\non day-dreams I thought of the distinguished figure of the poor\nbook-keeper in Alphonse Daudet\u2019s _Nabab_, through whom the author\nprobably described his own day-dreams. I imagined that I distinctly\nremembered one fantasy of this man, whom I called Mr. Jocelyn, which he\nhatched while walking the streets of Paris, and I began to reproduce\nit from memory. This fantasy described how Mr. Jocelyn boldly hurled\nhimself at a runaway horse and brought it to a standstill; how the\ncarriage door opened and a great personage stepped from the coup\u00e9,\npressed Mr. Jocelyn\u2019s hand and said: \u201cYou are my saviour--I owe my life\nto you! What can I do for you?\u201d\nI assured myself that casual inaccuracies in the rendition of this\nfantasy could readily be corrected at home on consulting the book. But\nwhen I perused _Nabab_ in order to compare it with my manuscript, I\nfound to my very great shame and consternation that there was nothing\nto suggest such a dream by Mr. Jocelyn; indeed, the poor book-keeper\ndid not even bear this name--he was called Mr. Joyeuse.\nThis second error then furnished the key for the solution of the first\nmistake, the faulty reminiscence. Joyeux, of which Joyeuse is the\nfeminine form, was the only possible word which would translate my\nown name _Freud_ into French. Whence, therefore, came this falsely\nremembered fantasy which I had attributed to Daudet? It could only be\na product of my own, a day-dream which I myself had spun, and which\ndid not become conscious, or which was once conscious and had since\nbeen absolutely forgotten. Perhaps I invented it myself in Paris, where\nfrequently enough I walked the streets alone, and full of longing for\na helper and protector, until Charcot took me into his circle. I had\noften met the author of _Nabab_ in Charcot\u2019s house. But the provoking\npart of it all is the fact that there is scarcely anything to which I\nam so hostile as the thought of being some one\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. What we see\nof this sort of thing in our country spoils all desire for it, and my\ncharacter is little suited to the r\u00f4le of a protected child. I have\nalways entertained an immense desire to \u201cbe the strong man myself.\u201d And\nit had to happen that I should be reminded of such a, to be sure, never\nfulfilled, day-dream! Besides, this incident is a good example of how\nthe restraint relation to one\u2019s ego, which breaks forth triumphantly in\nparanoia, disturbs and entangles us in the objective grasp of things.\nAnother case of faulty recollection which can be satisfactorily\nexplained resembles the _fausse reconnaissance_ to be discussed later.\nI related to one of my patients, an ambitious and very capable man,\nthat a young student had recently gained admittance into the circle\nof my pupils by means of an interesting work, _Der K\u00fcnstler, Versuch\neiner Sexualpsychologie_. When, a year and a quarter later, this work\nlay before me in print, my patient maintained that he remembered\nwith certainty having read somewhere, perhaps in a bookseller\u2019s\nadvertisement, the announcement of the same book even before I first\nmentioned it to him. He remembered that this announcement came to his\nmind at that time, and he ascertained besides that the author had\nchanged the title, that it no longer read \u201c_Versuch_\u201d but \u201c_Ans\u00e4tze zu\neiner Sexualpsychologie_.\u201d\nCareful inquiry of the author and comparison of all dates showed\nconclusively that my patient was trying to recall the impossible. No\nnotice of this work had appeared anywhere before its publication,\ncertainly not a year and a quarter before it went to print. However, I\nneglected to seek a solution for this false recollection until the same\nman brought about an equally valuable renewal of it. He thought that he\nhad recently noticed a work on \u201cagoraphobia\u201d in the show window of a\nbookshop, and as he was now looking for it in all available catalogues\nI was able to explain to him why his effort must remain fruitless.\nThe work on agoraphobia existed only in his fantasy as an unconscious\nresolution to write such a book himself. His ambition to emulate\nthat young man, and through such a scientific work to become one of\nmy pupils, had led him to the first as well as to the second false\nrecollection. He also recalled later that the bookseller\u2019s announcement\nwhich had occasioned his false reminiscence dealt with a work entitled\n_Genesis, Das Gesetz der Zeugung_ (\u201cGenesis, The Law of Generation\u201d).\nBut the change in the title as mentioned by him was really instigated\nby me; I recalled that I myself have perpetrated the same inaccuracy\nin the repetition of the title by saying \u201c_Ans\u00e4tze_\u201d in place of\n\u201c_Versuch_.\u201d\nB. FORGETTING OF INTENTIONS.\nNo other group of phenomena is better qualified to demonstrate the\nthesis that lack of attention does not in itself suffice to explain\nfaulty acts as the forgetting of intentions. An intention is an impulse\nfor an action which has already found approbation, but whose execution\nis postponed for a suitable occasion. Now, in the interval thus created\nsufficient change may take place in the motive to prevent the intention\nfrom coming to execution. It is not, however, forgotten, it is simply\nrevised and omitted.\nWe are naturally not in the habit of explaining the forgetting of\nintentions which we daily experience in every possible situation as\nbeing due to a recent change in the adjustment of motives. We generally\nleave it unexplained, or we seek a psychologic explanation in the\nassumption that at the time of execution the required attention for the\naction, which was an indispensable condition for the occurrence of the\nintention, and was then at the disposal of the same action, no longer\nexists. Observation of our normal behaviour towards intentions urges\nus to reject this tentative explanation as arbitrary. If I resolve in\nthe morning to carry out a certain intention in the evening, I may be\nreminded of it several times in the course of the day, but it is not\nat all necessary that it should become conscious throughout the day.\nAs the time for its execution approaches it suddenly occurs to me and\ninduces me to make the necessary preparation for the intended action.\nIf I go walking and take a letter with me to be posted, it is not\nat all necessary that I, as a normal not nervous individual, should\ncarry it in my hand and continually look for a letter-box. As a matter\nof fact I am accustomed to put it in my pocket and give my thoughts\nfree rein on my way, feeling confident that the first letter-box will\nattract my attention and cause me to put my hand in my pocket and draw\nout the letter.\nThis normal behaviour in a formed intention corresponds perfectly\nwith the experimentally produced conduct of persons who are under a\nso-called \u201cpost-hypnotic suggestion\u201d to perform something after a\ncertain time.[37] We are accustomed to describe the phenomenon in\nthe following manner: the suggested intention slumbers in the person\nconcerned until the time for its execution approaches. Then it awakes\nand excites the action.\nIn two positions of life even the layman is cognizant of the fact\nthat forgetting referring to intended purposes can in no wise claim\nconsideration as an elementary phenomenon no further reducible, but\nrealizes that it ultimately depends on unadmitted motives. I refer\nto affairs of love and military service. A lover who is late at the\nappointed place will vainly tell his sweetheart that unfortunately\nhe has entirely forgotten their rendezvous. She will not hesitate\nto answer him: \u201cA year ago you would not have forgotten. Evidently\nyou no longer care for me.\u201d Even if he should grasp the above cited\npsychologic explanation, and should wish to excuse his forgetting\non the plea of important business, he would only elicit the answer\nfrom the woman, who has become as keen-sighted as the physician in\nthe psychoanalytic treatment, \u201cHow remarkable that such business\ndisturbances did not occur before!\u201d Of course the woman does not\nwish to deny the possibility of forgetting; but she believes, and\nnot without reason, that practically the same inference of a certain\nunwillingness may be drawn from the unintentional forgetting as from a\nconscious subterfuge.\nSimilarly, in military service no distinction is recognized between\nan omission resulting from forgetting and one in consequence of\nintentional neglect. And rightly so. The soldier dares forget nothing\nthat military service demands of him. If he forgets in spite of this,\neven when he is acquainted with the demands, then it is due to the fact\nthat the motives which urge the fulfilment of the military exactions\nare opposed by contrary motives. Thus the one year\u2019s volunteer[38] who\nat inspection pleads forgetting as an excuse for not having polished\nhis buttons is sure to be punished. But this punishment is small in\ncomparison to the one he courts if he admits to his superiors that the\nmotive for his negligence is because \u201cthis miserable menial service is\naltogether disgusting to me.\u201d Owing to this saving of punishment for\neconomic reasons, as it were, he makes use of forgetting as an excuse,\nor it comes about as a compromise.\nThe service of women (as well as the military service of the State)\ndemands that nothing relating to that service be subject to forgetting.\nThus it but suggests that forgetting is permissible in unimportant\nmatters, but in weighty matters its occurrence is an indication that\none wishes to treat weighty matters as unimportant: that is, that\ntheir importance is disputed.[39] The view-point of psychic validity\nis in fact not to be contested here. No person forgets to carry out\nactions that seem important to himself without exposing himself to the\nsuspicion of being a sufferer from mental weakness. Our investigations\ntherefore can extend only to the forgetting of more or less secondary\nintentions, for no intention do we deem absolutely indifferent,\notherwise it would certainly never have been formed.\nAs in the preceding functional disturbances, I have collected the cases\nof neglect through forgetting which I have observed in myself, and\nendeavoured to explain them. I have found that they could invariably\nbe traced to some interference of unknown and unadmitted motives--or,\nas may be said, they were due to a counter-will. In a number of\nthese cases I found myself in a position similar to that of being in\nsome distasteful service: I was under a constraint to which I had not\nentirely resigned myself, so that I showed my protest in the form of\nforgetting. This accounts for the fact that I am particularly prone\nto forget to send congratulations on such occasions as birthdays,\njubilees, wedding celebrations, and promotions to higher rank. I\ncontinually make new resolutions, but I am more than ever convinced\nthat I shall not succeed. I am now on the point of giving it up\naltogether, and to admit consciously the striving motives. In a period\nof transition, I told a friend who asked me to send a congratulatory\ntelegram for him, at a certain time when I was to send one myself,\nthat I would probably forget both. It was not surprising that the\nprophecy came true. It is undoubtedly due to painful experiences in\nlife that I am unable to manifest sympathy where this manifestation\nmust necessarily appear exaggerated, for the small amount of my feeling\ndoes not admit the corresponding expression. Since I have learned that\nI often mistook the pretended sympathy of others for real, I am in\nrebellion against the conventions of expressing sympathy, the social\nexpediency of which I naturally acknowledge. Condolences in cases of\ndeath are excepted from this double treatment; once I determine to\nsend them I do not neglect them. Where my emotional participation has\nnothing more to do with social duty, its expression is never inhibited\nby forgetting.\nCases in which we forget to carry out actions which we have promised\nto do as a favour for others can similarly be explained as antagonism\nto conventional duty and as an unfavourable inward opinion. Here\nit regularly proves correct, inasmuch as the only person appealed\nto believes in the excusing power of forgetfulness, while the one\nrequesting the favour has no doubt about the right answer: he has no\ninterest in this matter, otherwise he would not have forgotten it.\nThere are some who are noted as generally forgetful, and we\nexcuse their lapses in the same manner as we excuse those who are\nshort-sighted when they do not greet us in the street.[40] Such persons\nforget all small promises which they have made; they leave unexecuted\nall orders which they have received; they prove themselves unreliable\nin little things; and at the same time demand that we shall not take\nthese slight offences amiss--that is, they do not want us to attribute\nthese failings to personal characteristics but to refer them to an\norganic peculiarity.[41] I am not one of these people myself, and have\nhad no opportunity to analyse the actions of such a person in order to\ndiscover from the selection of forgetting the motive underlying the\nsame. I cannot forego, however, the conjecture _per analogiam_, that\nhere the motive is an unusual large amount of unavowed disregard for\nothers which exploits the constitutional factor for its purpose.[42]\nIn other cases the motives for forgetting are less easy to discover,\nand when found excite greater astonishment. Thus, in former years I\nobserved that of a great number of professional calls I only forgot\nthose that I was to make on patients whom I treated gratis or on\ncolleagues. The mortification caused by this discovery led me to\nthe habit of noting every morning the calls of the day in a form of\nresolution. I do not know if other physicians have come to the same\npractice by a similar road. Thus we get an idea of what causes the\nso-called neurasthenic to make a memorandum of the communications\nhe wishes to make to the doctor. He apparently lacks confidence in\nthe reproductive capacity of his memory. This is true, but the scene\nusually proceeds in this manner. The patient has recounted his various\ncomplaints and inquiries at considerable length. After he has finished\nhe pauses for a moment, then he pulls out the memorandum and says\napologetically, \u201cI have made some notes because I cannot remember\nanything.\u201d As a rule he finds nothing new on the memorandum. He repeats\neach point and answers it himself: \u201cYes, I have already asked about\nthat.\u201d By means of the memorandum he probably only demonstrates one of\nhis symptoms, the frequency with which his resolutions are disturbed\nthrough the interference of obscure motives.\nI am touching, moreover, on an affliction to which even most of my\nhealthy acquaintances are subject, when I admit that especially in\nformer years I had the habit of easily forgetting for a long time\nto return borrowed books, also that it very often happened that I\ndeferred payments through forgetfulness. One morning not long ago I\nleft the tobacco-shop where I make my daily purchase of cigars without\npaying. It was a most harmless omission, as I am known there and could\ntherefore expect to be reminded of my debt the next morning. But\nthis slight neglect, the attempt to contract a debt, was surely not\nunconnected with reflections concerning the budget with which I had\noccupied myself throughout the preceding day. Even among the so-called\nrespectable people one can readily demonstrate a double behaviour when\nit concerns the theme of money and possession. The primitive greed of\nthe suckling which wishes to seize every object (in order to put it in\nits mouth) has generally been only imperfectly subdued through culture\nand training.[43]\nI fear that in all the examples thus far given I have grown quite\ncommonplace. But it can be only a pleasure to me if I happen upon\nfamiliar matters which every one understands, for my main object is\nto collect everyday material and utilize it scientifically. I cannot\nconceive why wisdom, which is, so to speak, the sediment of everyday\nexperiences, should be denied admission among the acquisitions of\nknowledge. For it is not the diversity of objects but the stricter\nmethod of verification and the striving for far-reaching connections\nwhich make up the essential character of scientific work.\nWe have invariably found that intentions of some importance are\nforgotten when obscure motives arise to disturb them. In still less\nimportant intentions we find a second mechanism of forgetting. Here\na counter-will becomes transferred to the resolution from something\nelse after an external association has been formed between the latter\nand the content of the resolution. The following example reported by\nBrill illustrates this: \u201cA patient found that she had suddenly become\nvery negligent in her correspondence. She was naturally punctual and\ntook pleasure in letter-writing, but for the last few weeks she simply\ncould not bring herself to write a letter without exerting the greatest\namount of effort. The explanation was quite simple. Some weeks before\nshe had received an important letter calling for a categorical answer.\nShe was undecided what to say, and therefore did not answer it at all.\nThis indecision in the form of inhibition was unconsciously transferred\nto other letters and caused the inhibition against letter-writing in\ngeneral.\u201d\nDirect counter-will and more remote motivation are found together in\nthe following example of delaying: I had written a short treatise on\nthe dream for the series _Grenzfragen des Nerven- und Seelenlebens_,\nin which I gave an abstract of my book, _The Interpretation of\nDreams_.[44] Bergmann, the publisher, had sent me the proof sheets\nand asked for a speedy return of the same as he wished to issue the\npamphlet before Christmas. I corrected the sheets the same night, and\nplaced them on my desk in order to take them to the post office the\nnext morning. In the morning I forgot all about it, and only thought\nof it in the afternoon at the sight of the paper cover on my desk.\nIn the same way I forgot the proofs that evening and the following\nmorning, and until the afternoon of the second day, when I quickly\ntook them to a letter-box, wondering what might be the basis of this\nprocrastination. Obviously I did not want to send them off, although I\ncould find no explanation for such an attitude.\nAfter posting the letter I entered the shop of my Vienna publisher,\nwho put out my _Interpretation of Dreams_. I left a few orders; then,\nas if impelled by a sudden thought, said, \u201cYou undoubtedly know that\nI have written the \u2018Dream\u2019 book a second time?\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d he exclaimed,\n\u201cthen I must ask you to----\u201d \u201cCalm yourself,\u201d I interposed; \u201cit is only\na short treatise for the L\u00f6wenfeld-Kurella collection.\u201d But still he\nwas not satisfied; he feared that the abstract would hurt the sale of\nthe book. I disagreed with him, and finally asked: \u201cIf I had come to\nyou before, would you have objected to the publication?\u201d \u201cNo; under no\ncircumstances,\u201d he answered.\nPersonally I believe I acted within my full rights and did nothing\ncontrary to the general practice; still it seems certain to me that a\nthought similar to that entertained by the publisher was the motive for\nmy procrastination in dispatching the proof sheets.\nThis reflection leads back to a former occasion when another publisher\nraised some difficulties because I was obliged to take out several\npages of the text from an earlier work on cerebral infantile paralysis,\nand put them unchanged into a work on the same theme in Nothnagel\u2019s\nhandbook. There again the reproach received no recognition; that time\nalso I had loyally informed my first publisher (the same who published\n_The Interpretation of Dreams_) of my intention.\nHowever, if this series of recollections is followed back still farther\nit brings to light a still earlier occasion relating to a translation\nfrom the French, in which I really violated the property rights that\nshould be considered in a publication. I had added notes to the text\nwithout asking the author\u2019s permission, and some years later I had\ncause to think that the author was dissatisfied with this arbitrary\naction.\nThere is a proverb which indicates the popular knowledge that the\nforgetting of intentions is not accidental. It says: \u201cWhat one forgets\nonce he will often forget again.\u201d\nIndeed, we sometimes cannot help feeling that no matter what may be\nsaid about forgetting and faulty actions, the whole subject is already\nknown to everybody as something self-evident. It is strange enough that\nit is still necessary to push before consciousness such well-known\nfacts. How often I have heard people remark: \u201cPlease do not ask me to\ndo this, I shall surely forget it.\u201d The coming true of this prophecy\nlater is surely nothing mysterious in itself. He who speaks thus\nperceives the inner resolution not to carry out the request, and only\nhesitates to acknowledge it to himself.\nMuch light is thrown, moreover, on the forgetting of resolutions\nthrough something which could be designated as \u201cforming false\nresolutions.\u201d I had once promised a young author to write a review of\nhis short work, but on account of inner resistances, not unknown to\nme, I promised him that it would be done the same evening. I really\nhad serious intentions of doing so, but I had forgotten that I had\nset aside that evening for the preparation of an expert testimony\nthat could not be deferred. After I thus recognized my resolution as\nfalse, I gave up the struggle against my resistances and refused the\nauthor\u2019s request.\nVIII\nERRONEOUSLY CARRIED-OUT ACTIONS\nI shall give another passage from the above-mentioned work of Meringer\nand Mayer (p. 98):\n\u201cLapses in speech do not stand entirely alone. They resemble the errors\nwhich often occur in our other activities and are quite foolishly\ntermed \u2018forgetfulness.\u2019\u201d\nI am therefore in no way the first to presume that there is a sense and\npurpose behind the slight functional disturbances of the daily life of\nhealthy people.[45]\nIf the lapse in speech, which is without doubt a motor function,\nadmits of such a conception, it is quite natural to transfer to the\nlapses of our other motor functions the same expectation. I have here\nformed two groups of cases; all these cases in which the faulty effect\nseems to be the essential element--that is, the deviation from the\nintention--I denote as erroneously carried-out actions (_Vergreifen_);\nthe others, in which the entire action appears rather inexpedient,\nI call \u201csymptomatic and chance actions.\u201d But no distinct line of\ndemarcation can be formed; indeed, we are forced to conclude that all\ndivisions used in this treatise are of only descriptive significance\nand contradict the inner unity of the sphere of manifestation.\nThe psychologic understanding of erroneous actions apparently gains\nlittle in clearness when we place it under the head of \u201cataxia,\u201d and\nespecially under \u201ccortical ataxia.\u201d Let us rather try to trace the\nindividual examples to their proper determinants. To do this I shall\nagain resort to personal observations, the opportunities for which I\ncould not very frequently find in myself.\n(_a_) In former years, when I made more calls at the homes of patients\nthan I do at present, it often happened, when I stood before a door\nwhere I should have knocked or rung the bell, that I would pull the\nkey of my own house from my pocket, only to replace it, quite abashed.\nWhen I investigated in what patients\u2019 homes this occurred, I had to\nadmit that the faulty action--taking out my key instead of ringing the\nbell--signified paying a certain tribute to the house where the error\noccurred. It was equivalent to the thought \u201cHere I feel at home,\u201d as\nit happened only where I possessed the patient\u2019s regard. (Naturally, I\nnever rang my own door-bell.)\nThe faulty action was therefore a symbolic representation of a definite\nthought which was not accepted consciously as serious; for in reality\nthe neurologist is well aware that the patient seeks him only so long\nas he expects to be benefited by him, and that his own excessively\nwarm interest for his patient is evinced only as a means of psychic\ntreatment.\nAn almost identical repetition of my experience is described by A.\nMaeder (\u201cContrib. \u00e0 la psychopathologie de la vie quotidienne,\u201d _Arch.\nde Psychol._, vi., 1906): \u201cIl est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun de sortir son\ntrousseau, en arrivant \u00e0 la porte d\u2019un ami particuli\u00e8rement cher, de se\nsurprendre pour ainsi dire, en train d\u2019ouvrir avec sa cl\u00e9 comme chez\nsoi. C\u2019est un retard, puisqu\u2019il faut sonner malgr\u00e9 tout, mais c\u2019est\nune preuve qu\u2019on se sent--ou qu\u2019on voudrait se sentir--comme chez soi,\naupr\u00e8s de cet ami.\u201d\nJones speaks as follows about the use of keys:[46] \u201cThe use of keys is\na fertile source of occurrences of this kind, of which two examples may\nbe given. If I am disturbed in the midst of some engrossing work at\nhome by having to go to the hospital to carry out some routine work,\nI am very apt to find myself trying to open the door of my laboratory\nthere with the key of my desk at home, although the two keys are quite\nunlike each other. The mistake unconsciously demonstrates where I\nwould rather be at the moment.\n\u201cSome years ago I was acting in a subordinate position at a certain\ninstitution, the front door of which was kept locked, so that it was\nnecessary to ring for admission. On several occasions I found myself\nmaking serious attempts to open the door with my house key. Each one of\nthe permanent visiting staff, of which I aspired to be a member, was\nprovided with a key to avoid the trouble of having to wait at the door.\nMy mistake thus expressed the desire to be on a similar footing and to\nbe quite \u2018at home\u2019 there.\u201d\nA similar experience is reported by Dr. Hans Sachs of Vienna: \u201cI always\ncarry two keys with me, one for the door of my office and one for my\nresidence. They are not by any means easily interchanged, as the office\nkey is at least three times as big as my house key. Besides, I carry\nthe first in my trouser pocket and the other in my vest pocket. Yet it\noften happened that I noticed on reaching the door that while ascending\nthe stairs I had taken out the wrong key. I decided to undertake a\nstatistical examination; as I was daily in about the same emotional\nstate when I stood before both doors, I thought that the interchanging\nof the two keys must show a regular tendency, if they were differently\ndetermined psychically. Observation of later occurrences showed that\nI regularly took out my house key before the office door. Only on one\noccasion was this reversed: I came home tired, knowing that I would\nfind there a guest. I made an attempt to unlock the door with the,\nnaturally too big, office key.\u201d\n(_b_) At a certain time twice a day for six years I was accustomed\nto wait for admission before a door in the second story of the same\nhouse, and during this long period of time it happened twice (within a\nshort interval) that I climbed a story higher. On the first of these\noccasions I was in an ambitious day-dream, which allowed me to \u201cmount\nalways higher and higher.\u201d In fact, at that time I heard the door in\nquestion open as I put my foot on the first step of the third flight.\nOn the other occasion I again went too far \u201cengrossed in thought.\u201d As\nsoon as I became aware of it, I turned back and sought to snatch the\ndominating fantasy; I found that I was irritated over a criticism of\nmy works, in which the reproach was made that I \u201calways went too far,\u201d\nwhich I replaced by the less respectful expression \u201cclimbed too high.\u201d\n(_c_) For many years a reflex hammer and a tuning-fork lay side by side\non my desk. One day I hurried off at the close of my office hours, as\nI wished to catch a certain train, and, despite broad daylight, put\nthe tuning-fork in my coat pocket in place of the reflex hammer. My\nattention was called to the mistake through the weight of the object\ndrawing down my pocket. Any one unaccustomed to reflect on such slight\noccurrences would without hesitation explain the faulty action by the\nhurry of the moment, and excuse it. In spite of that, I preferred to\nask myself why I took the tuning-fork instead of the hammer. The haste\ncould just as well have been a motive for carrying out the action\nproperly in order not to waste time over the correction.\n\u201cWho last grasped the tuning-fork?\u201d was the question which immediately\nflashed through my mind. It happened that only a few days ago an\nidiotic child, whose attention to sensory impressions I was testing,\nhad been so fascinated by the tuning-fork that I found it difficult to\ntear it away from him. Could it mean, therefore, that I was an idiot?\nTo be sure, so it would seem, as the next thought which associated\nitself with the hammer was _chamer_ (Hebrew for \u201cass\u201d).\nBut what was the meaning of this abusive language? We must here inquire\ninto the situation. I hurried to a consultation at a place on the\nWestern railroad to see a patient who, according to the anamnesis which\nI received by letter, had fallen from a balcony some months before,\nand since then had been unable to walk. The physician who invited me\nwrote that he was still unable to say whether he was dealing with a\nspinal injury or traumatic neurosis--hysteria. That was what I was to\ndecide. This could therefore be a reminder to be particularly careful\nin this delicate differential diagnosis. As it is, my colleagues think\nthat hysteria is diagnosed far too carelessly where more serious\nmatters are concerned. But the abuse is not yet justified. Yes, the\nnext association was that the small railroad station is the same place\nin which, some years previous, I saw a young man who, after a certain\nemotional experience, could not walk properly. At that time I diagnosed\nhis malady as hysteria, and later put him under psychic treatment; but\nit afterward turned out that my diagnosis was neither incorrect nor\ncorrect. A large number of the patient\u2019s symptoms were hysterical,\nand they promptly disappeared in the course of treatment. But back\nof these there was a visible remnant that could not be reached by\ntherapy, and could be referred only to a multiple sclerosis. Those who\nsaw the patient after me had no difficulty in recognizing the organic\naffection. I could scarcely have acted or judged differently, still the\nimpression was that of a serious mistake; the promise of a cure which I\nhad given him could naturally not be kept.\nThe mistake in grasping the tuning-fork instead of the hammer could\ntherefore be translated into the following words: \u201cYou fool, you ass,\nget yourself together this time, and be careful not to diagnose again\na case of hysteria where there is an incurable disease, as you did in\nthis place years ago in the case of the poor man!\u201d And fortunately for\nthis little analysis, even if unfortunately for my mood, this same\nman, now having a very spastic gait, had been to my office a few days\nbefore, one day after the examination of the idiotic child.\nWe observe that this time it is the voice of self-criticism which makes\nitself perceptible through the mistake in grasping. The erroneously\ncarried-out action is specially suited to express self-reproach. The\npresent mistake attempts to represent the mistake which was committed\nelsewhere.\n(_d_) It is quite obvious that grasping the wrong thing may also serve\na whole series of other obscure purposes. Here is a first example: It\nis very seldom that I break anything. I am not particularly dexterous,\nbut by virtue of the anatomic integrity of my nervous and muscular\napparatus there are apparently no grounds in me for such awkward\nmovements with undesirable results. I can recall no object in my home\nthe counterpart of which I have ever broken. Owing to the narrowness\nof my study it has often been necessary for me to work in the most\nuncomfortable position among my numerous antique clay and stone\nobjects, of which I have a small collection. So much is this true that\nonlookers have expressed fear lest I topple down something and shatter\nit. But it never happened. Then why did I brush to the floor the cover\nof my simple inkwell so that it broke into pieces?\nMy inkstand is made of a flat piece of marble which is hollowed out\nfor the reception of the glass inkwell; the inkwell has a marble cover\nwith a knob of the same stone. A circle of bronze statuettes with small\nterra-cotta figures is set behind this inkstand. I seated myself at the\ndesk to write, I made a remarkably awkward outward movement with the\nhand holding the pen-holder, and so swept the cover of the inkstand,\nwhich already lay on the desk, to the floor.\nIt is not difficult to find the explanation. Some hours before my\nsister had been in the room to look at some of my new acquisitions. She\nfound them very pretty, and then remarked: \u201cNow the desk really looks\nvery well, only the inkstand does not match. You must get a prettier\none.\u201d I accompanied my sister out and did not return for several hours.\nBut then, as it seems, I performed the execution of the condemned\ninkstand.\nDid I perhaps conclude from my sister\u2019s words that she intended to\npresent me with a prettier inkstand on the next festive occasion, and\ndid I shatter the unsightly old one in order to force her to carry out\nher signified intention? If that be so, then my swinging motion was\nonly apparently awkward; in reality it was most skilful and designed,\nas it understood how to avoid all the valuable objects located near it.\nI actually believe that we must accept this explanation for a whole\nseries of seemingly accidental awkward movements. It is true that\non the surface these seem to show something violent and irregular,\nsimilar to spastic-ataxic movements, but on examination they seem to\nbe dominated by some intention, and they accomplish their aim with a\ncertainty that cannot be generally credited to conscious arbitrary\nmotions. In both characteristics, the force as well as the sure aim,\nthey show besides a resemblance to the motor manifestations of the\nhysterical neurosis, and in part also to the motor accomplishments of\nsomnambulism, which here as well as there point to the same unfamiliar\nmodification of the functions of innervation.\nIn latter years, since I have been collecting such observations, it\nhas happened several times that I have shattered and broken objects of\nsome value, but the examination of these cases convinced me that it\nwas never the result of accident or of my unintentional awkwardness.\nThus, one morning while in my bath-robe and straw slippers I followed a\nsudden impulse as I passed a room, and hurled a slipper from my foot\nagainst the wall so that it brought down a beautiful little marble\nVenus from its bracket. As it fell to pieces I recited quite unmoved\nthe following verse from Busch:--\n\u201cAch! Die Venus ist perd\u00fc--[47]\nKlickeradoms!--von Medici!\u201d\nThis crazy action and my calmness at the sight of the damage is\nexplained in the then existing situation. We had a very sick person in\nthe family, of whose recovery I had personally despaired. That morning\nI had been informed that there was a great improvement; I know that I\nhad said to myself, \u201cAfter all she will live.\u201d My attack of destructive\nmadness served therefore as the expression of a grateful feeling\ntoward fate, and afforded me the opportunity of performing an \u201cact\nof sacrifice,\u201d just as if I had vowed, \u201cIf she gets well I will give\nthis or that as a sacrifice.\u201d That I chose the Venus of Medici as this\nsacrifice was only gallant homage to the convalescent. But even to-day\nit is still incomprehensible to me that I decided so quickly, aimed so\naccurately, and struck no other object in close proximity.\nAnother breaking, in which I utilized a pen-holder falling from\nmy hand, also signified a sacrifice, but this time it was a pious\noffering to avert some evil. I had once allowed myself to reproach a\ntrue and worthy friend for no other reason than certain manifestations\nwhich I interpreted from his unconscious activity. He took it amiss\nand wrote me a letter in which he bade me not to treat my friends by\npsychoanalysis. I had to admit that he was right and appeased him\nwith my answer. While writing this letter I had before me my latest\nacquisition--a small, handsome glazed Egyptian figure. I broke it in\nthe manner mentioned, and then immediately knew that I had caused this\nmischief to avert a greater one. Luckily, both the friendship and the\nfigure could be so cemented that the break would not be noticed.\nA third case of breaking had a less serious connection; it was only a\ndisguised \u201cexecution,\u201d to use an expression from Th. Vischer\u2019s _Auch\nEiner_, of an object that no longer suited my taste. For quite a while\nI had carried a cane with a silver handle; through no fault of mine the\nthin silver plate was once damaged and poorly repaired. Soon after the\ncane was returned I mirthfully used the handle to angle for the leg of\none of my children. In that way it naturally broke, and I got rid of it.\nThe indifference with which we accept the resulting damage in all\nthese cases may certainly be taken as evidence for the existence of an\nunconscious purpose in their execution.\n(_e_) As can sometimes be demonstrated by analysis, the dropping of\nobjects or the overturning and breaking of the same are very frequently\nutilized as the expression of unconscious streams of thought, but more\noften they serve to represent the superstitious or odd significances\nconnected therewith in popular sayings. The meanings attached to the\nspilling of salt, the overturning of a wineglass, the sticking of a\nknife dropped to the floor, and so on, are well known. I shall discuss\nlater the right to investigate such superstitious interpretations;\nhere I shall simply observe that the individual awkward acts do not\nby any means always have the same meaning, but, depending on the\ncircumstances, they serve to represent now this or that purpose.\nRecently we passed through a period in my house during which an\nunusual number of glass and china dishes were broken. I myself largely\ncontributed to this damage. This little endemic was readily explained\nby the fact that it preceded the public betrothal of my eldest\ndaughter. On such festivities it is customary to break some dishes and\nutter at the same time some felicitating expression. This custom may\nsignify a sacrifice or express any other symbolic sense.\nWhen servants destroy fragile objects through dropping them, we\ncertainly do not think in the first place of a psychologic motive for\nit; still, some obscure motives are not improbable even here. Nothing\nlies farther from the uneducated than the appreciation of art and works\nof art. Our servants are dominated by a foolish hostility against these\nproductions, especially when the objects, whose worth they do not\nrealize, become a source of a great deal of work for them. On the other\nhand, persons of the same education and origin employed in scientific\ninstitutions often distinguish themselves by great dexterity and\nreliability in the handling of delicate objects, as soon as they begin\nto identify themselves with their masters and consider themselves an\nessential part of the staff.\nI shall here add the report of a young mechanical engineer, which gives\nsome insight into the mechanism of damaging things.\n\u201cSome time ago I worked with many others in the laboratory of the\nHigh School on a series of complicated experiments on the subject of\nelasticity. It was a work that we undertook of our own volition, but it\nturned out that it took up more of our time than we expected. One day,\nwhile going to the laboratory with F., he complained of losing so much\ntime, especially on this day, when he had so many other things to do at\nhome. I could only agree with him, and he added half jokingly, alluding\nto an incident of the previous week: \u2018Let us hope that the machine will\nrefuse to work, so that we can interrupt the experiment and go home\nearlier.\u2019\n\u201cIn arranging the work, it happened that F. was assigned to the\nregulation of the pressure valve, that is, it was his duty to carefully\nopen the valve and let the fluid under pressure flow from the\naccumulator into the cylinder of the hydraulic press. The leader of\nthe experiment stood at the manometer and called a loud \u2018Stop!\u2019 when\nthe maximum pressure was reached. At this command F. grasped the valve\nand turned it with all his force--to the left (all valves, without\nany exception, are closed to the right). This caused a sudden full\npressure in the accumulator of the press, and as there was no outlet,\nthe connecting pipe burst. This was quite a trifling accident to the\nmachine, but enough to force us to stop our work for the day and go\nhome.\n\u201cIt is characteristic, moreover, that some time later, on discussing\nthis occurrence, my friend F. could not recall the remark that I\npositively remember his having made.\u201d\nSimilarly, to fall, to make a misstep, or to slip need not always be\ninterpreted as an entirely accidental miscarriage of a motor action.\nThe linguistic double meaning of these expressions points to diverse\nhidden fantasies, which may present themselves through the giving up\nof bodily equilibrium. I recall a number of lighter nervous ailments\nin women and girls which made their appearance after falling without\ninjury, and which were conceived as traumatic hysteria as a result\nof the shock of the fall. At that time I already entertained the\nimpression that these conditions had a different connection, that the\nfall was already a preparation of the neurosis, and an expression of\nthe same unconscious fantasies of sexual content which may be taken as\nthe moving forces behind the symptoms. Was not this very thing meant in\nthe proverb which says, \u201cWhen a maiden falls, she falls on her back?\u201d\nWe can also add to these mistakes the case of one who gives a beggar a\ngold piece in place of a copper or a silver coin. The solution of such\nmishandling is simple: it is an act of sacrifice designed to mollify\nfate, to avert evil, and so on. If we hear a tender mother or aunt\nexpress concern regarding the health of a child, directly before taking\na walk during which she displays her charity, contrary to her usual\nhabit, we can no longer doubt the sense of this apparently undesirable\naccident. In this manner our faulty acts make possible the practice of\nall those pious and superstitious customs which must shun the light of\nconsciousness, because of the strivings against them of our unbelieving\nreason.\n(_f_) That accidental actions are really intentional will find no\ngreater credence in any other sphere than in sexual activity, where the\nborder between the intention and accident hardly seems discernible.\nThat an apparently clumsy movement may be utilized in a most refined\nway for sexual purposes I can verify by a nice example from my own\nexperience. In a friend\u2019s house I met a young girl visitor who excited\nin me a feeling of fondness which I had long believed extinct, thus\nputting me in a jovial, loquacious, and complaisant mood. At that time\nI endeavoured to find out how this came about, as a year before this\nsame girl made no impression on me.\nAs the girl\u2019s uncle, a very old man, entered the room, we both jumped\nto our feet to bring him a chair which stood in the corner. She was\nmore agile than I and also nearer the object, so that she was the\nfirst to take possession of the chair. She carried it with its back to\nher, holding both hands on the edge of the seat. As I got there later\nand did not give up the claim to carrying the chair, I suddenly stood\ndirectly back of her, and with both my arms was embracing her from\nbehind, and for a moment my hands touched her lap. I naturally solved\nthe situation as quickly as it came about. Nor did it occur to anybody\nhow dexterously I had taken advantage of this awkward movement.\nOccasionally I have had to admit to myself that the annoying, awkward\nstepping aside on the street, whereby for some seconds one steps\nhere and there, yet always in the same direction as the other person,\nuntil finally both stop facing each other, that this \u201cbarring one\u2019s\nway\u201d repeats an ill-mannered, provoking conduct of earlier times\nand conceals erotic purposes under the mask of awkwardness. From my\npsychoanalysis of neurotics I know that the so-called na\u00efvet\u00e9 of young\npeople and children is frequently only such a mask, employed in order\nthat the subject may say or do the indecent without restraint.\nW. Stekel has reported similar observations in regard to himself: \u201cI\nentered a house and offered my right hand to the hostess. In a most\nremarkable way I thereby loosened the bow which held together her loose\nmorning-gown. I was conscious of no dishonourable intent, still I\nexecuted this awkward movement with the agility of a juggler.\u201d\n(_g_) The effects which result from mistakes of normal persons are, as\na rule, of a most harmless nature. Just for this reason it would be\nparticularly interesting to find out whether mistakes of considerable\nimportance, which could be followed by serious results, as, for\nexample, those of physicians or druggists, fall within the range of our\npoint of view.\nAs I am seldom in a position to deal with active medical matters, I\ncan only report one mistake from my own experience. I treated a very\nold woman, whom I visited twice daily for several years. My medical\nactivities were limited to two acts, which I performed during my\nmorning visits: I dropped a few drops of an eye lotion into her eyes\nand gave her a hypodermic injection of morphine. I prepared regularly\ntwo bottles--a blue one, containing the eye lotion, and a white one,\ncontaining the morphine solution. While performing these duties my\nthoughts were mostly occupied with something else, for they had been\nrepeated so often that the attention acted as if free. One morning I\nnoticed that the automaton worked wrong; I had put the dropper into the\nwhite instead of into the blue bottle, and had dropped into the eyes\nthe morphine instead of the lotion. I was greatly frightened, but then\ncalmed myself through the reflection that a few drops of a _two per\ncent_. solution of morphine would not likely do any harm even if left\nin the conjunctival sac. The cause of the fright manifestly belonged\nelsewhere.\nIn attempting to analyse the slight mistake I first thought of the\nphrase, \u201cto seize the old woman by mistake,\u201d which pointed out the\nshort way to the solution. I had been impressed by a dream which a\nyoung man had told me the previous evening, the contents of which could\nbe explained only on the basis of sexual intercourse with his own\nmother.[48] The strangeness of the fact that the \u0152dipus legend takes\nno offence at the age of Queen Jocasta seemed to me to agree with the\nassumption that in being in love with one\u2019s mother we never deal with\nthe present personality, but with her youthful memory picture carried\nover from our childhood. Such incongruities always show themselves\nwhere one fantasy fluctuating between two periods is made conscious,\nand is then bound to one definite period.\nDeep in thoughts of this kind, I came to my patient of over ninety;\nI must have been well on the way to grasp the universal character\nof the \u0152dipus fable as the correlation of the fate which the oracle\npronounces, for I made a blunder in reference to or on the old woman.\nHere, again, the mistake was harmless; of the two possible errors,\ntaking the morphine solution for the eye, or the eye lotion for the\ninjection, I chose the one by far the least harmful. The question still\nremains open whether in mistakes in handling things which may cause\nserious harm we can assume an unconscious intention as in the cases\nhere discussed.\nThe following case from Brill\u2019s experience corroborates the assumption\nthat even serious mistakes are determined by unconscious intentions:\n\u201cA physician received a telegram informing him that his aged uncle was\nvery sick. In spite of important family affairs at home he at once\nrepaired to that distant town because his uncle was really his father,\nwho had cared for him since he was one and a half years old, when his\nown father had died. On reaching there he found his uncle suffering\nfrom pneumonia, and, as the old man was an octogenarian, the doctors\nheld out no hope for his recovery. \u2018It was simply a question of a day\nor two,\u2019 was the local doctor\u2019s verdict. Although a prominent physician\nin a big city, he refused to co-operate in the treatment, as he found\nthat the case was properly managed by the local doctor, and he could\nnot suggest anything to improve matters.\n\u201cSince death was daily expected, he decided to remain to the end. He\nwaited a few days, but the sick man struggled hard, and although there\nwas no question of any recovery, because of the many new complications\nwhich had arisen, death seemed to be deferred for a while. One night\nbefore retiring he went into the sick-room and took his uncle\u2019s pulse.\nAs it was quite weak, he decided not to wait for the doctor, and\nadministered a hypodermic injection. The patient grew rapidly worse\nand died within a few hours. There was something strange in the last\nsymptoms, and on later attempting to replace the tube of hypodermic\ntablets into the case, he found to his consternation that he had taken\nout the wrong tube, and instead of a small dose of digitalis he had\ngiven a large dose of hyoscine.\n\u201cThis case was related to me by the doctor after he read my paper on\nthe \u0152dipus Complex.[49] We agreed that this mistake was determined not\nonly by his impatience to get home to his sick child, but also by an\nold resentment and unconscious hostility toward his uncle (father).\u201d\nIt is known that in the more serious cases of psychoneuroses one\nsometimes finds self-mutilations as symptoms of the disease. That the\npsychic conflict may end in suicide can never be excluded in these\ncases. Thus I know from experience, which some day I shall support\nwith convincing examples, that many apparently accidental injuries\nhappening to such patients are really self-inflicted. This is brought\nabout by the fact that there is a constantly lurking tendency to\nself-punishment, usually expressing itself in self-reproach, or\ncontributing to the formation of a symptom, which skilfully makes\nuse of an external situation. The required external situation may\naccidentally present itself or the punishment tendency may assist it\nuntil the way is open for the desired injurious effect.\nSuch occurrences are by no means rare even in cases of moderate\nseverity, and they betray the portion of unconscious intention through\na series of special features--for example, through the striking\npresence of mind which the patients show in the pretended accidents.[50]\nI will report exhaustively one in place of many such examples from\nmy professional experience. A young woman broke her leg below the\nknee in a carriage accident so that she was bedridden for weeks. The\nstriking part of it was the lack of any manifestation of pain and the\ncalmness with which she bore her misfortune. This calamity ushered in\na long and serious neurotic illness, from which she was finally cured\nby psychotherapy. During the treatment I discovered the circumstances\nsurrounding the accident, as well as certain impressions which preceded\nit. The young woman with her jealous husband spent some time on\nthe farm of her married sister, in company with her numerous other\nbrothers and sisters with their wives and husbands. One evening she\ngave an exhibition of one of her talents before this intimate circle;\nshe danced artistically the \u201ccancan,\u201d to the great delight of her\nrelatives, but to the great annoyance of her husband, who afterward\nwhispered to her, \u201cAgain you have behaved like a prostitute.\u201d The words\ntook effect; we will leave it undecided whether it was just on account\nof the dance. That night she was restless in her sleep, and the next\nforenoon she decided to go out driving. She chose the horses herself,\nrefusing one team and demanding another. Her youngest sister wished\nto have her baby with its nurse accompany her, but she opposed this\nvehemently. During the drive she was nervous; she reminded the coachman\nthat the horses were getting skittish, and as the fidgety animals\nreally produced a momentary difficulty she jumped from the carriage\nin fright and broke her leg, while those remaining in the carriage\nwere uninjured. Although after the disclosure of these details we can\nhardly doubt that this accident was really contrived, we cannot fail\nto admire the skill which forced the accident to mete out a punishment\nso suitable to the crime. For as it happened \u201ccancan\u201d dancing with her\nbecame impossible for a long time.\nConcerning self-inflicted injuries of my own experience, I cannot\nreport anything in calm times, but under extraordinary conditions I do\nnot believe myself incapable of such acts. When a member of my family\ncomplains that he or she has bitten his tongue, bruised her finger,\nand so on, instead of the expected sympathy I put the question, \u201cWhy\ndid you do that?\u201d But I have most painfully squeezed my thumb, after a\nyouthful patient acquainted me during the treatment with his intention\n(naturally not to be taken seriously) of marrying my eldest daughter,\nwhile I knew that she was then in a private hospital in extreme danger\nof losing her life.\nOne of my boys, whose vivacious temperament was wont to put\ndifficulties in the management of nursing him in his illness, had a fit\nof anger one morning because he was ordered to remain in bed during the\nforenoon, and threatened to kill himself: a way out suggested to him\nby the newspapers. In the evening he showed me a swelling on the side\nof his chest which was the result of bumping against the door knob.\nTo my ironical question why he did it, and what he meant by it, the\neleven-year-old child explained, \u201cThat was my attempt at suicide which\nI threatened this morning.\u201d However, I do not believe that my views on\nself-inflicted wounds were accessible to my children at that time.\nWhoever believes in the occurrence of semi-intentional self-inflicted\ninjury--if this awkward expression be permitted--will become prepared\nto accept through it the fact that aside from conscious intentional\nsuicide there also exists semi-intentional annihilation--with\nunconscious intention--which is capable of aptly utilizing a threat\nagainst life and masking it as a casual mishap. Such mechanism is by no\nmeans rare. For the tendency to self-destruction exists to a certain\ndegree in many more persons than in those who bring it to completion.\nSelf-inflicted injuries are, as a rule, a compromise between this\nimpulse and the forces working against it, and even where it really\ncomes to suicide the inclination has existed for a long time with less\nstrength or as an unconscious and repressed tendency.\nEven suicide consciously committed chooses its time, means, and\nopportunity; it is quite natural that unconscious suicide should wait\nfor a motive to take upon itself one part of the causation and thus\nfree it from its oppression by taking up the defensive forces of the\nperson.[51] These are in no way idle discussions which I here bring\nup; more than one case of apparently accidental misfortune (on a\nhorse or out of a carriage) has become known to me whose surrounding\ncircumstances justified the suspicion of suicide.\nFor example, during an officers\u2019 horse-race one of the riders fell\nfrom his horse and was so seriously injured that a few days later he\nsuccumbed to his injuries. His behaviour after regaining consciousness\nwas remarkable in more than one way, and his conduct previous to the\naccident was still more remarkable. He had been greatly depressed by\nthe death of his beloved mother, had crying spells in the society of\nhis comrades, and to his trusted friend had spoken of the _t\u00e6dium\nvit\u00e6_. He had wished to quit the service in order to take part in a\nwar in Africa which had no interest for him.[52] Formerly a keen\nrider, he had later evaded riding whenever possible. Finally, before\nthe horse-race, from which he could not withdraw, he expressed a sad\nforeboding, which most expectedly in the light of our conception came\ntrue. It may be contended that it is quite comprehensible without any\nfurther cause that a person in such a state of nervous depression\ncannot manage a horse as well as on normal days. I quite agree with\nthat, only I should like to look for the mechanism of this motor\ninhibition through \u201cnervousness\u201d in the intention of self-destruction\nhere emphasized.\nDr. Ferenczi has left to me for publication the analysis of an\napparently accidental injury by shooting which he explained as an\nunconscious attempt at suicide. I can only agree with his deduction:--\n\u201cJ. Ad., 22 years old, carpenter, visited me on the 18th of January,\n1908. He wished to know whether the bullet which pierced his left\ntemple March 20, 1907, could or should be removed by operation. Aside\nfrom occasional, not very severe, headaches, he felt quite well, also\nthe objective examination showed nothing besides the characteristic\npowder wound on the left temple, so that I advised against an\noperation. When questioned concerning the circumstances of the case he\nasserted that he injured himself accidentally. He was playing with his\nbrother\u2019s revolver, and _believing that it was not loaded_ he pressed\nit with his left hand against the left temple (he is not left-handed),\nput his finger on the trigger, and the shot went off. _There were three\nbullets in the six-shooter._\n\u201cI asked him how he came to carry the revolver, and he answered that it\nwas at the time of his army conscription, that he took it to the inn\nthe evening before because he feared fights. At the army examination\nhe was considered unfit for service on account of varicose veins,\nwhich caused him much mortification. He went home and played with the\nrevolver. He had no intention of hurting himself, but the accident\noccurred. On further questioning whether he was otherwise satisfied\nwith his fortune, he answered with a sigh, and related a love affair\nwith a girl who loved him in return, but nevertheless left him. She\nemigrated to America out of sheer avariciousness. He wanted to follow\nher, but his parents prevented him. His lady-love left on the 20th of\nJanuary, 1907, just two months before the accident.\n\u201cDespite all these suspicious elements the patient insisted that the\nshot was an \u2018accident.\u2019 I was firmly convinced, however, that the\nneglect to find out whether the revolver was loaded before he began to\nplay with it, as well as the self-inflicted injury, were psychically\ndetermined. He was still under the depressing effects of the unhappy\nlove affair, and apparently wanted \u2018to forget everything\u2019 in the army.\nWhen this hope, too, was taken away from him he resorted to playing\nwith the weapon--that is, to an unconscious attempt at suicide. The\nfact that he did not hold the revolver in the right but in the left\nhand speaks conclusively in favour of the fact that he was really only\n\u2018playing\u2019--that is, he did not wish consciously to commit suicide.\u201d\nAnother analysis of an apparently accidental self-inflicted wound,\ndetailed to me by an observer, recalls the saying, \u201cHe who digs a pit\nfor others falls in himself.\u201d[53]\n\u201cMrs. X., belonging to a good middle-class family, is married and has\nthree children. She is somewhat nervous, but never needed any strenuous\ntreatment, as she could sufficiently adapt herself to life. One day she\nsustained a rather striking though transitory disfigurement of her face\nin the following manner: She stumbled in a street that was in process\nof repair and struck her face against the house wall. The whole face\nwas bruised, the eyelids blue and \u0153dematous, and as she feared that\nsomething might happen to her eyes she sent for the doctor. After she\nwas calmed I asked her, \u2018But why did you fall in such a manner?\u2019 She\nanswered that just before this accident she warned her husband, who\nhad been suffering for some months from a joint affection, to be very\ncareful in the street, and she often had the experience that in some\nremarkable way those things occurred to her against which she warned\nothers.\n\u201cI was not satisfied with this as the determination of her accident,\nand asked her whether she had not something else to tell me. \u2018Yes, just\nbefore the accident she noticed a nice picture in a shop on the other\nside of the street, which she suddenly desired as an ornament for her\nnursery, and wished to buy it at once. She thereupon walked across to\nthe shop without looking at the street, stumbled over a heap of stones,\nand fell with her face against the wall without making the slightest\neffort to shield herself with her hands. The intention to buy the\npicture was immediately forgotten, and she walked home in haste.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018But why were you not more careful?\u2019 I asked.\n\u201c\u2018Oh!\u2019 she answered, \u2018perhaps it was only a punishment for that episode\nwhich I confided to you!\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Has this episode still bothered you?\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Yes, later I regretted it very much; I considered myself wicked,\ncriminal, and immoral, but at the time I was almost crazy with\nnervousness.\u2019\n\u201cShe referred to an abortion which was started by a quack and had to be\nbrought to completion by a gynecologist. This abortion was initiated\nwith the consent of her husband, as both wished, on account of their\npecuniary circumstances, to be spared from being additionally blessed\nwith children.\n\u201cShe said: \u2018I had often reproached myself with the words, \u201cYou really\nhad your child killed,\u201d and I feared that such a crime could not\nremain unpunished. Now that you have assured me that there is nothing\nseriously wrong with my eyes I am quite assured I have already been\nsufficiently punished.\u2019\n\u201cThis accident, therefore, was, on the one hand, a retribution for\nher sin, but, on the other hand, it may have served as an escape from\na more dire punishment which she had feared for many months. In the\nmoment that she ran to the shop to buy the picture the memory of this\nwhole history, with its fears (already quite active in her unconscious\nat the time she warned her husband), became overwhelming and could\nperhaps find expression in words like these: \u2018But why do you want an\nornament for the nursery?--you who had your child killed! You are a\nmurderer! The great punishment is surely approaching!\u2019\n\u201cThis thought did not become conscious, but instead of it she made use\nof the situation--I might say of the psychologic moment--to utilize\nin a commonplace manner the heap of stones to inflict upon herself\nthis punishment. It was for this reason that she did not even attempt\nto put out her arms while falling and was not much frightened. The\nsecond, and probably lesser, determinant of her accident was obviously\nthe self-punishment for her unconscious wish to be rid of her husband,\nwho was an accessory to the crime in this affair. This was betrayed by\nher absolutely superfluous warning to be very careful in the street on\naccount of the stones. For, just because her husband had a weak leg, he\nwas very careful in walking.\u201d\nIf such a rage against one\u2019s own integrity and one\u2019s own life\ncan be hidden behind apparently accidental awkwardness and motor\ninsufficiency, then it is not a big step forward to grasp the\npossibility of transferring the same conception to mistakes which\nseriously endanger the life and health of others. What I can put\nforward as evidence for the validity of this conception was taken\nfrom my experience with neurotics, and hence does not fully meet the\ndemands of this situation. I will report a case in which it was not\nan erroneously carried-out action, but what may be more aptly termed\na symbolic or chance action that gave me the clue which later made\npossible the solution of the patient\u2019s conflict.\nI once undertook to improve the marriage relations of a very\nintelligent man, whose differences with his tenderly attached young\nwife could surely be traced to real causes, but as he himself admitted\ncould not be altogether explained through them. He continually occupied\nhimself with the thought of a separation, which he repeatedly rejected\nbecause he dearly loved his two small children. In spite of this he\nalways returned to that resolution and sought no means to make the\nsituation bearable to himself. Such an unsettlement of a conflict\nserved to prove to me that there were unconscious and repressed\nmotives which enforced the conflicting conscious thoughts, and in such\ncases I always undertake to end the conflict by psychic analysis. One\nday the man related to me a slight occurrence which had extremely\nfrightened him. He was sporting with the older child, by far his\nfavourite. He tossed it high in the air and repeated this tossing till\nfinally he thrust it so high that its head almost struck the massive\ngas chandelier. Almost, but not quite, or say \u201cjust about!\u201d Nothing\nhappened to the child except that it became dizzy from fright. The\nfather stood transfixed with the child in his arms, while the mother\nmerged into an hysterical attack. The particular facility of this\ncareless movement, with the violent reaction in the parents, suggested\nto me to look upon this accident as a symbolic action which gave\nexpression to an evil intention toward the beloved child.\nI could remove the contradiction of the actual tenderness of this\nfather for his child by referring the impulse to injure it to the\ntime when it was the only one, and so small that as yet the father\nhad no occasion for tender interest in it. Then it was easy to assume\nthat this man, so little pleased with his wife at that time, might\nhave thought: \u201cIf this small being for whom I have no regard whatever\nshould die, I would be free and could separate from my wife.\u201d The wish\nfor the death of this much loved being must therefore have continued\nunconsciously. From here it was easy to find the way to the unconscious\nfixation of this wish.\nThere was indeed a powerful determinant in a memory from the patient\u2019s\nchildhood: it referred to the death of a little brother, which the\nmother laid to his father\u2019s negligence, and which led to serious\nquarrels with threats of separation between the parents. The continued\ncourse of my patient\u2019s life, as well as the therapeutic success\nconfirmed my analysis.\nIX\nSYMPTOMATIC AND CHANCE ACTIONS\nThe actions described so far, in which we recognize the execution of\nan unconscious intention, appeared as disturbances of other unintended\nactions, and hid themselves under the pretext of awkwardness. Chance\nactions, which we shall now discuss, differ from erroneously carried\nout actions only in that they disdain the support of a conscious\nintention and really need no pretext. They appear independently and\nare accepted because one does not credit them with any aim or purpose.\nWe execute them \u201cwithout thinking anything of them,\u201d \u201cby mere chance,\u201d\n\u201cjust to keep the hands busy,\u201d and we feel confident that such\ninformation will be quite sufficient should one inquire as to their\nsignificance. In order to enjoy the advantage of this exceptional\nposition these actions which no longer claim awkwardness as an excuse\nmust fulfil certain conditions: they must not be striking, and their\neffects must be insignificant.\nI have collected a large number of such \u201cchance actions\u201d from myself\nand others, and after thoroughly investigating the individual\nexamples, I believe that the name \u201csymptomatic actions\u201d is more\nsuitable. They give expression to something which the actor himself\ndoes not suspect in them, and which as a rule he has no intention\nof imparting to others, but aims to keep to himself. Like the other\nphenomena considered so far, they thus play the part of symptoms.\nThe richest output of such chance or symptomatic actions is above all\nobtained in the psychoanalytic treatment of neurotics. I cannot deny\nmyself the pleasure of showing by two examples of this nature how\nfar and how delicately the determination of these plain occurrences\nare swayed by unconscious thoughts. The line of demarcation between\nthe symptomatic actions and the erroneously carried out actions is\nso indefinite that I could have disposed of these examples in the\npreceding chapter.\n(_a_) During the analysis a young woman reproduced this idea which\nsuddenly occurred to her. Yesterday while cutting her nails \u201cshe had\ncut into the flesh while engaged in trimming the cuticle.\u201d This is\nof so little interest that we ask in astonishment why it is at all\nremembered and mentioned, and therefore come to the conclusion that\nwe deal with a symptomatic action. It was really the finger upon\nwhich the wedding-ring is worn which was injured through this slight\nawkwardness. It happened, moreover, on her wedding-day, which thus\ngives to the injury of the delicate skin a very definite and easily\nguessed meaning. At the same time she also related a dream which\nalluded to the awkwardness of her husband and her anesthesia as a\nwoman. But why did she injure the ring finger of her left hand when the\nwedding-ring is worn on the right? Her husband is a jurist, a \u201cDoctor\nof Laws\u201d (_Doktor der Rechte_, literally a Doctor of Rights), and her\nsecret affection as a girl belonged to a physician who was jokingly\ncalled _Doktor der Linke_ (literally Doctor of Left). Incidentally a\nleft-handed marriage has a definite meaning.\n(_b_) A single young woman relates: \u201cYesterday, quite unintentionally,\nI tore a hundred-dollar note in two pieces and gave half to a woman\nwho was visiting me. Is that, too, a symptomatic action?\u201d After\ncloser investigation the matter of the hundred-dollar note elicited\nthe following associations: She dedicated a part of her time and\nher fortune to charitable work. Together with another woman she was\ntaking care of the rearing of an orphan. The hundred dollars was the\ncontribution sent her by that woman, which she enclosed in an envelope\nand provisionally deposited on her writing-desk.\nThe visitor was a prominent woman with whom she was associated in\nanother act of charity. This woman wished to note the names of a\nnumber of persons to whom she could apply for charitable aid. There was\nno paper, so my patient grasped the envelope from her desk, and without\nthinking of its contents tore it in two pieces, one of which she kept,\nin order to have a duplicate list of names, and gave the other to her\nvisitor.\nNote the harmlessness of this aimless occurrence. It is known that a\nhundred-dollar note suffers no loss in value when it is torn, provided\nall the pieces are produced. That the woman would not throw away the\npiece of paper was assumed by the importance of the names on it, and\nthere was just as little doubt that she would return the valuable\ncontent as soon as she noticed it.\nBut to what unconscious thought should this chance action, which was\nmade possible through forgetfulness, give expression? The visitor in\nthis case had a very definite relation to my patient and myself. It was\nshe who at one time had recommended me as physician to the suffering\ngirl, and if I am not mistaken my patient considered herself indebted\nfor this advice. Should this halved hundred-dollar note perhaps\nrepresent a fee for her mediation? That still remained enigmatic.\nBut other material was added to this beginning. Several days before a\nwoman mediator of a different sort had inquired of a relative whether\nthe gracious young lady wished to make the acquaintance of a certain\ngentleman, and that morning, some hours before the woman\u2019s visit, the\nwooing letter of the suitor arrived, giving occasion for much mirth.\nWhen therefore the visitor opened the conversation with inquiries\nregarding the health of my patient, the latter could well have thought:\n\u201cYou certainly found me the right doctor, but if you could assist me\nin obtaining the right husband (and a child) I should be still more\ngrateful.\u201d\nBoth mediators became fused into one in this repressed thought, and\nshe handed the visitor the fee which her fantasy was ready to give the\nother. This resolution became perfectly convincing when I add that I\nhad told her of such chance or symptomatic actions only the previous\nevening. She then took advantage of the next occasion to produce an\nanalogous action.\nWe can undertake a grouping of these extremely frequent chance and\nsymptomatic actions according to their occurrence as habitual, regular\nunder certain circumstances, and as isolated ones. The first group\n(such as playing with the watch-chain, fingering one\u2019s beard, and\nso on), which can almost serve as a characteristic of the person\nconcerned, is related to the numerous tic movements, and certainly\ndeserves to be dealt with in connection with the latter. In the second\ngroup I place the playing with one\u2019s cane, the scribbling with one\u2019s\npencil, the jingling of coins in one\u2019s pocket, kneading dough and other\nplastic materials, all sorts of handling of one\u2019s clothing, and many\nother actions of the same order.\nThese playful occupations during psychic treatment regularly conceal\nsense and meaning to which other expression is denied. Generally the\nperson in question knows nothing about it; he is unaware whether he is\ndoing the same thing or whether he has imitated certain modifications\nin his customary playing, and he also fails to see or hear the\neffects of these actions. For example, he does not hear the noise\nwhich is produced by the jingling of coins, and he is astonished and\nincredulous when his attention is called to it. Of equal significance\nto the physician, and worthy of his observation, is everything that\none does with his clothing often without noticing it. Every change in\nthe customary attire, every little negligence, such as an unfastened\nbutton, every trace of exposure means to express something that the\nwearer of the apparel does not wish to say directly, usually he is\nentirely unconscious of it.\nThe interpretation of these trifling chance actions, as well as the\nproof for their interpretation, can be demonstrated every time with\nsufficient certainty from the surrounding circumstances during the\ntreatment, from the themes under discussion, and from the ideas that\ncome to the surface when attention is directed to the seeming accident.\nBecause of this connection I will refrain from supporting my assertions\nby reporting examples with their analyses; but I mention these matters\nbecause I believe that they have the same meaning in normal persons as\nin my patients.\nI cannot, however, refrain from showing by at least one example how\nclosely an habitually accomplished symbolic action may be connected\nwith the most intimate and important part of the life of a normal\nindividual.[54]\n\u201cAs Professor Freud has taught us, the symbolism in the infantile life\nof the normal plays a greater r\u00f4le than was expected from earlier\npsychoanalytic experiences. In view of this the following brief\nanalysis may be of general interest, especially on account of its\nmedical aspects.\n\u201cA doctor on rearranging his furniture in a new house came across a\nstraight, wooden stethoscope, and, after pausing to decide where he\nshould put it, was impelled to place it on the side of his writing-desk\nin such a position that it stood exactly between his chair and the\none reserved for his patients. The act in itself was certainly odd,\nfor in the first place the straight stethoscope served no purpose,\nas he invariably used a binaural one; and in the second place all his\nmedical apparatus and instruments were always kept in drawers, with the\nsole exception of this one. However, he gave no thought to the matter\nuntil one day it was brought to his notice by a patient who had never\nseen a wooden stethoscope, asking him what it was. On being told, she\nasked why he kept it there. He answered in an offhand way that that\nplace was as good as any other. This, however, started him thinking,\nand he wondered whether there had been an unconscious motive in his\naction. Being interested in the psychoanalytic method, he asked me to\ninvestigate the matter.\n\u201cThe first memory that occurred to him was the fact that when a medical\nstudent he had been struck by the habit his hospital interne had of\nalways carrying in his hand a wooden stethoscope on his ward visits,\nalthough he never used it. He greatly admired this interne, and was\nmuch attached to him. Later on, when he himself became an interne he\ncontracted the same habit, and would feel very uncomfortable if by\nmistake he left the room without having the instrument to swing in his\nhand. The aimlessness of the habit was shown, not only by the fact\nthat the only stethoscope he ever used was a binaural one, which he\ncarried in his pocket, but also in that it was continued when he was a\nsurgical interne and never needed any stethoscope at all.\n\u201cFrom this it was evident that the idea of the instrument in question\nhad in some way or other become invested with a greater psychic\nsignificance than normally belongs to it--in other words, that to the\nsubject it stood for more than it does for other people. The idea\nmust have got unconsciously associated with some other one, which\nit symbolized, and from which it derived its additional fulness of\nmeaning. I will forestall the rest of the analysis by saying what\nthis secondary idea was--namely, a phallic one; the way in which this\ncurious association had been formed will presently be related. The\ndiscomfort he experienced in hospital on missing the instrument, and\nthe relief and assurance the presence of it gave him, was related to\nwhat is known as a \u2018castration-complex\u2019--namely, a childhood fear,\noften continued in a disguised form into adult life, lest a private\npart of his body should be taken away from him, just as playthings so\noften were. The fear was due to paternal threats that it would be cut\noff if he were not a good boy, particularly in a certain direction.\nThis is a very common complex, and accounts for a great deal of general\nnervousness and lack of confidence in later years.\n\u201cThen came a number of childhood memories relating to his family\ndoctor. He had been strongly attached to this doctor as a child, and\nduring the analysis long-buried memories were recovered of a double\nphantasy he had in his fourth year concerning the birth of a younger\nsister--namely, that she was the child (1) of himself and his mother,\nthe father being relegated to the background, and (2) of the doctor and\nhimself; in this he thus played both a masculine and feminine part.[55]\nAt the time, when his curiosity was being aroused by the event, he\ncould not help noticing the prominent share taken by the doctor in the\nproceedings, and the subordinate position occupied by the father: the\nsignificance of this for his later life will presently be pointed out.\n\u201cThe stethoscope association was formed through many connections.\nIn the first place, the physical appearance of the instrument--a\nstraight, rigid, hollow tube, having a small bulbous summit at one\nextremity and a broad base at the other--and the fact of its being\nthe essential part of the medical paraphernalia, the instrument with\nwhich the doctor performed his magical and interesting feats, were\nmatters that attracted his boyish attention. He had had his chest\nrepeatedly examined by the doctor at the age of six, and distinctly\nrecollected the voluptuous sensation of feeling the latter\u2019s head\nnear him pressing the wooden stethoscope into his chest, and of the\nrhythmic to-and-fro respiratory movement. He had been struck by the\ndoctor\u2019s habit of carrying his stethoscope inside his hat; he found it\ninteresting that the doctor should carry his chief instrument concealed\nabout his person, always handy when he went to see patients, and that\nhe only had to take off his hat (_i.e_., a part of his clothing) and\n\u2018pull it out.\u2019 At the age of eight he was impressed by being told by\nan older boy that it was the doctor\u2019s custom to get into bed with\nhis women patients. It is certain that the doctor, who was young and\nhandsome, was extremely popular among the women of the neighbourhood,\nincluding the subject\u2019s own mother. The doctor and his \u2018instrument\u2019\nwere therefore the objects of great interest throughout his boyhood.\n\u201cIt is probable that, as in many other cases, unconscious\nidentification with the family doctor had been a main motive in\ndetermining the subject\u2019s choice of profession. It was here doubly\nconditioned (1) by the superiority of the doctor on certain interesting\noccasions to the father, of whom the subject was very jealous, and (2)\nby the doctor\u2019s knowledge of forbidden topics[56] and his opportunity\nfor illicit indulgence. The subject admitted that he had on several\noccasions experienced erotic temptations in regard to his women\npatients; he had twice fallen in love with one, and finally had married\none.\n\u201cThe next memory was of a dream, plainly of a homosexual-masochistic\nnature; in it a man, who proved to be a replacement figure of the\nfamily doctor, attacked the subject with a \u2018sword.\u2019 The idea of a\nsword, as is so frequently the case in dreams, represented the same\nidea that was mentioned above to be associated with that of a wooden\nstethoscope. The thought of a sword reminded the subject of the passage\nin the _Nibelung Saga_, where Sigurd sleeps with his naked sword\n(_Gram_) between him and Brunhilda, an incident that had always greatly\nstruck his imagination.\n\u201cThe meaning of the symptomatic act now at last became clear. The\nsubject had placed his wooden stethoscope between him and his patients,\njust as Sigurd had placed his sword (an equivalent symbol) between him\nand the maiden he was not to touch. The act was a compromise-formation;\nit served both to gratify in his imagination the repressed wish to\nenter into nearer relations with an attractive patient (interposition\nof phallus), and at the same time to remind him that this wish was not\nto become a reality (interposition of sword). It was, so to speak, a\ncharm against yielding to temptation.\n\u201cI might add that the following passage from Lord Lytton\u2019s _Richelieu_\nmade a great impression on the boy:--\n\u2018_Beneath the rule of men entirely great\nThe pen is mightier than the sword_,\u2019[57]\nand that he became a prolific writer and uses an unusually large\nfountain-pen. When I asked him what need he had of this pen, he replied\nin a characteristic manner, \u2018I have so much to express.\u2019\n\u201cThis analysis again reminds us of the profound views that are afforded\nus in the psychic life through the \u2018harmless\u2019 and \u2018senseless\u2019 actions,\nand how early in life the tendency to symbolization develops.\u201d\nI can also relate an experience from my psychotherapeutic practice in\nwhich the hand, playing with a mass of bread-crumbs, gave evidence of\nan eloquent declaration. My patient was a boy not yet thirteen years of\nage, who had been very hysterical for two years. I finally took him for\npsychoanalytic treatment, after a lengthy stay at a hydrotherapeutic\ninstitution had proved futile. My supposition was that he must have\nhad sexual experiences, and that, corresponding to his age, he had\nbeen troubled by sexual questions; but I was cautious about helping\nhim with explanations as I wished to test further my assumption. I was\ntherefore curious as to the manner in which the desired material would\nevince itself in him.\nOne day it struck me that he was rolling something between the fingers\nof his right hand; he would thrust it into his pocket and there\ncontinue playing with it, then would draw it out again, and so on. I\ndid not ask what he had in his hand; but as he suddenly opened his hand\nhe showed it to me. It was bread-crumbs kneaded into a mass. At the\nnext session he again brought along a mass, and in the course of our\nconversation, although his eyes were closed, modelled a figure with an\nincredible rapidity which excited my interest. Without doubt it was a\nmanikin like the crudest prehistoric idols, with a head, two arms, two\nlegs, and an appendage between the legs which he drew out to a long\npoint.\nThis was scarcely completed when he kneaded the manikin together again:\nlater he allowed it to remain, but modelled an identical appendage on\nthe flat of the back and on other parts in order to veil the meaning of\nthe first. I wished to show him that I had understood him, but at the\nsame time I wanted to deprive him of the evasion that he had thought\nof nothing while actively forming these figures. With this intention\nI suddenly asked him whether he remembered the story of the Roman king\nwho gave his son\u2019s envoy a pantomimic answer in his garden.\nThe boy did not wish to recall what he must have learned so much more\nrecently than I. He asked if that was the story of the slave on whose\nbald skull the answer was written. I told him, \u201cNo, that belonged to\nGreek history,\u201d and related the following: \u201cKing Tarquinius Superbus\nhad induced his son Sextus to steal into a Latin city. The son, who had\nlater obtained a foothold in the city, sent a messenger to the king\nasking what steps he should take next. The king gave no answer, but\nwent into his garden, had the question repeated there, and silently\nstruck off the heads of the largest and most beautiful poppies.\nAll that the messenger could do was to report this to Sextus, who\nunderstood his father, and caused the most distinguished citizens of\nthe city to be removed by assassination.\u201d\nWhile I was speaking the boy stopped kneading, and as I was relating\nwhat the king did in his garden, I noticed that at the words \u201csilently\nstruck\u201d he tore off the head of the manikin with a movement as quick\nas lightning. He therefore understood me, and showed that he was also\nunderstood by me. Now I could question him directly, and gave him the\ninformation that he desired, and in a short time the neurosis came to\nan end.\nThe symptomatic actions which we observe in inexhaustible abundance in\nhealthy as well as in nervous people are worthy of our interest for\nmore than one reason. To the physician they often serve as valuable\nindications for orienting himself in new or unfamiliar conditions;\nto the keen observer they often betray everything, occasionally even\nmore than he cares to know. He who is familiar with its application\nsometimes feels like King Solomon, who, according to the Oriental\nlegend, understood the language of animals.\nOne day I was to examine a strange young man at his mother\u2019s home. As\nhe came towards me I was attracted by a large stain on his trousers,\nwhich by its peculiar stiff edges I recognized as one produced by\nalbumen. After a moment\u2019s embarrassment the young man excused this\nstain by remarking that he was hoarse and therefore drank a raw egg,\nand that some of the slippery white of the egg had probably fallen on\nhis clothes. To confirm his statements he showed the eggshell which\ncould still be seen on a small plate in the room. The suspicious spot\nwas thus explained in this harmless way; but as his mother left us\nalone I thanked him for having so greatly facilitated the diagnosis\nfor me, and without further procedure I took as the topic of our\ndiscussion his confession that he was suffering from the effects of\nmasturbation.\nAnother time I called on a woman as rich as she was miserly and\nfoolish, who was in the habit of giving the physician the task of\nworking his way through a heap of her complaints before he could reach\nthe simple cause of her condition. As I entered she was sitting at\na small table engaged in arranging silver dollars in little piles:\nas she rose she tumbled some of the pieces of money to the floor.\nI helped her pick them up, but interrupted the recitation of her\nmisery by remarking: \u201cHas your good son-in-law been spending so much\nof your money again?\u201d She bitterly denied this, only to relate a few\nmoments later the lamentable story of the aggravation caused by her\nson-in-law\u2019s extravagances. And she has not sent for me since. I cannot\nmaintain that one always makes friends of those to whom he tells the\nmeaning of their symptomatic actions.\nHe who observes his fellow-men while at table will be able to verify in\nthem the nicest and most instructive symptomatic actions.\nDr. Hans Sachs relates the following:--\n\u201cI happened to be present when an elderly couple related to me partook\nof their supper. The lady had stomach trouble and was forced to follow\na strict diet. A roast was put before the husband, and he requested\nhis wife, who was not allowed to partake of this food, to give him\nthe mustard. The wife opened the closet and took out the small bottle\nof stomach drops, and placed it on the table before her husband.\nBetween the barrel-shaped mustard-glass and the small drop-bottle\nthere was naturally no similarity through which the mishandling could\nbe explained; yet the wife only noticed the mistake after her husband\nlaughingly called her attention to it. The sense of this symptomatic\naction needs no explanation.\u201d\nFor an excellent example of this kind which was very skilfully utilized\nby the observer, I am indebted to Dr. Bernh. Dattner (Vienna):--\n\u201cI dined in a restaurant with my colleague H., a doctor of philosophy.\nHe spoke about the injustice done to probationary students, and added\nthat even before he finished his studies he was placed as secretary to\nthe ambassador, or rather the extraordinary plenipotentiary Minister to\nChili. \u2018But,\u2019 he added, \u2018the minister was afterwards transferred, and\nI did not make any effort to meet the newly appointed.\u2019 While uttering\nthe last sentence he was lifting a piece of pie to his mouth, but he\nlet it drop as if out of awkwardness. I immediately grasped the hidden\nsense of this symptomatic action, and remarked to my colleague, who was\nunacquainted with psychoanalysis, \u2018You really allowed a very choice\nmorsel to slip from you.\u2019 He did not realize, however, that my words\ncould equally refer to his symptomatic action, and he repeated the same\nwords I uttered with a peculiarly agreeable and surprising vividness,\nas if I had actually taken the words from his mouth: \u2018It was really\na very choice morsel that I allowed to get away from me.\u2019 He then\nfollowed this remark with a detailed description of his clumsiness,\nwhich has cost him this very remunerative position.\n\u201cThe sense of this symbolic action becomes clearer if we remember that\nmy colleague had scruples about telling me, almost a perfect stranger,\nconcerning his precarious material situation, and his repressed thought\ntook on the mask of symptomatic action which expressed symbolically\nwhat was meant to be concealed, and the speaker thus got relief from\nhis unconscious.\u201d\nThat the taking away or taking along things without any apparent\nintention may prove to be senseful may be shown by the following\nexamples.\nI. Dr. B. Dattner relates: \u201cAn acquaintance paid the first\nafter-marriage visit to a highly regarded lady friend of his youth. He\ntold me of this visit and expressed his surprise at the fact that he\nfailed in his resolution to visit with her only a short time, and then\nreported to me a rather strange faulty act which happened to him there.\n\u201cThe husband of this friend, who took part in the conversation, was\nlooking for a box of matches which he was sure was on the table when\nhe came there. My acquaintance, too, looked through his pockets to\nascertain whether he had not put it in his pocket, but without avail.\nSome time later he actually found it in his pocket, and was struck by\nthe fact that there was only one match in the box.\n\u201cA dream a few days later showing the box symbolism in reference to\nthe friend of his youth confirmed my explanation. With the symptomatic\naction my acquaintance meant to announce his priority-right and the\nexclusiveness of his possession (it contained only one match).\u201d\nDr. Hans Sachs relates the following: \u201cOur cook is very fond of a\ncertain kind of pie. There is no possible doubt about this, as it is\nthe only kind of pastry which she always prepares well. One Sunday she\nbrought this pie to the table, took it off the pie-plate, and proceeded\nto remove the dishes used in the former course, but on the top of this\npile she placed the pie, and disappeared with it into the kitchen. We\nfirst thought that she had something to improve on the pie, but as she\nfailed to appear my wife rang the bell and asked, \u2018Betty, what happened\nto the pie?\u2019 to which the girl answered, without comprehending the\nquestion, \u2018How is that?\u2019 We had to call her attention to the fact that\nshe carried the pie back to the kitchen. She had put it on the pile of\ndishes, taken it out, and put it away \u2018without noticing it.\u2019\n\u201cThe next day, when we were about to consume the rest of the pie,\nmy wife noticed that there was as much of it as we had left the day\nbefore--that is, the girl had disdained to eat the portion of her\nfavourite dish which was rightly hers. Questioned why she did not eat\nthe pie, she answered, somewhat embarrassed, that she did not care for\nit.\n\u201cThe infantile attitude is distinctly noticeable on both\noccasions--first the childish insatiableness in refusing to share with\nanybody the object of her wishes, then the reaction of spite which is\njust as childish: \u2018If you grudge it to me, keep it for yourself, I want\nnothing of it.\u2019\u201d\nChance or symptomatic actions occurring in affairs of married life have\noften a most serious significance, and could lead those who do not\nconcern themselves with the psychology of the unconscious to a belief\nin omens. It is not an auspicious beginning if a young woman loses her\nwedding-ring on her wedding-tour, even if it were only mislaid and soon\nfound.\nI know a woman, now divorced, who in the management of her business\naffairs frequently signed her maiden name many years before she\nactually resumed it.\nOnce I was the guest of a newly married couple and heard the young\nwoman laughingly relate her latest experience, how, on the day\nsucceeding her return from the wedding tour she had sought out her\nsingle sister in order to go shopping with her as in former times,\nwhile her husband was attending business. Suddenly she noticed a man\non the opposite side of the street; nudging her sister she said, \u201cWhy,\nthat is surely Mr. L.\u201d She forgot that for some weeks this man had been\nher husband. I was chilled at this tale, but I did not dare draw any\ninferences. The little story came back to me only several years later,\nafter this marriage had ended most unhappily.\nThe following observation, which could as well have found a place among\nthe examples of forgetting, was taken from a noteworthy work published\nin French by A. Maeder.[58]\n\u201cUne dame nous racontait r\u00e9cement qu\u2019elle avait oublie d\u2019essayer sa\nrobe de noce et s\u2019en souvint la veille du marriage, \u00e0 huit heur du\nsoir, la couturi\u00e8re d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rait de voir sa cliente. Ce d\u00e9tail suffit \u00e0\nmontrer que la fianc\u00e9e ne se sentait pas tr\u00e8s heureuse de porter une\nrobe d\u2019\u00e9pouse, elle cherchait \u00e0 oublier cette repr\u00e9sentation p\u00e9nible.\nElle est aujourd\u2019hui ... divorc\u00e9e.\u201d\nA friend who has learned to observe signs related to me that the great\nactress Eleanora Duse introduces a symptomatic action into one of her\nr\u00f4les which shows very nicely from what depth she draws her acting. It\nis a drama dealing with adultery; she has just been discussing with\nher husband and now stands soliloquizing before the seducer makes his\nappearance. During this short interval she plays with her wedding-ring,\nshe pulls it off, replaces it, and finally takes it off again. She is\nnow ready for the other.\nI know of an elderly man who married a young girl, and instead of\nstarting at once on his wedding tour he decided to spend the night in a\nhotel. Scarcely had they reached the hotel, when he noticed with fright\nthat he was without his wallet, in which he had the entire sum of money\nfor the wedding tour; he must have mislaid or lost it. He was still\nable to reach his servant by telephone; the latter found the missing\narticle in the coat discarded for the travelling clothes and brought it\nto the hotel to the waiting bridegroom, who had thus entered upon his\nmarriage without means.\nIt is consoling to think that the \u201closing of objects\u201d by people is\nmerely an unsuspected extension of a symptomatic action, and is thus\nwelcome at least to the secret intention of the loser. Often it is only\nan expression of slight appreciation of the lost article, a secret\ndislike for the same, or perhaps for the person from whom it came,\nor the desire to lose this object was transferred to it from other\nand more important objects through symbolic association. The loss of\nvaluable articles serves as an expression of diverse feelings; it\nmay either symbolically represent a repressed thought--that is, it\nmay bring back a memory which one would rather not hear--or it may\nrepresent a sacrifice to the obscure forces of fate, the worship of\nwhich is not yet entirely extinct even with us.[59]\nThe following examples will illustrate these statements concerning the\nlosing of objects:--\nDr. B. Dattner states: \u201cA colleague related to me that he lost his\nsteel pencil which he had had for over two years, and which, on\naccount of its superior quality, was highly prized by him. Analysis\nelicited the following facts: The day before he had received a very\ndisagreeable letter from his brother-in-law, the concluding sentence\nof which read: \u2018At present I have neither the desire nor the time to\nassist you in your carelessness and laziness.\u2019 The effect connected\nwith this letter was so powerful that the next day he promptly\nsacrificed the pencil which was a present from this brother-in-law in\norder not to be burdened with his favours.\u201d\nBrill reports the following example: \u201cA doctor took exception to the\nfollowing statement in my book, \u2018We never lose what we really want\u2019\n(_Psychanalysis, its Theories and Practical Application_, p. 214). His\nwife, who is very interested in psychologic subjects, read with him\nthe chapter on \u201cPsychopathology of Everyday Life\u201d; they were both very\nmuch impressed with the novelty of the ideas, and so on, and were very\nwilling to accept most of the statements. He could not, however, agree\nwith the above-given statement because, as he said to his wife, \u2018I\nsurely did not wish to lose my knife.\u2019 He referred to a valuable knife\ngiven to him by his wife, which he highly prized, the loss of which\ncaused him much pain.\n\u201cIt did not take his wife very long to discover the solution for this\nloss in a manner to convince them both of the accuracy of my statement.\nWhen she presented him with this knife he was a bit loath to accept\nit. Although he considered himself quite emancipated, he nevertheless\nentertained some superstition about giving or accepting a knife as a\ngift, because it is said that a knife cuts friendship. He even remarked\nthis to his wife, who only laughed at his superstition. He had the\nknife for years before it disappeared.\n\u201cAnalysis brought out the fact that the disappearance of the knife was\ndirectly connected with a period when there were violent quarrels\nbetween himself and his wife, which threatened to end in separation.\nThey lived happily together until his step-daughter (it was his second\nmarriage) came to live with them. His daughter was the cause of many\nmisunderstandings, and it was at the height of these quarrels that he\nlost the knife.\n\u201cThe unconscious activity is very nicely shown in this symptomatic\naction. In spite of his apparent freedom from superstition, he still\nunconsciously believed that a donated knife may cut friendship between\nthe persons concerned. The losing of it was simply an unconscious\ndefence against losing his wife, and by sacrificing the knife he made\nthe superstitious ban impotent.\u201d\nIn a lengthy discussion and with the aid of dream analysis[60] Otto\nRank made clear the sacrificial tendency with its deep-reaching\nmotivation. It must be said that just such symptomatic actions often\ngive us access to the understanding of the intimate psychic life of the\nperson.\nOf the many isolated chance-actions, I will relate one example which\nshowed a deeper meaning even without analysis. This example clearly\nexplains the conditions under which such symptoms may be produced most\ncasually, and also shows that an observation of practical importance\nmay be attached to it. During a summer tour it happened that I had to\nwait several days at a certain place for the arrival of my travelling\ncompanions. In the meantime I made the acquaintance of a young man, who\nalso seemed lonely and was quite willing to join me. As we lived at the\nsame hotel it was quite natural that we should take all our meals and\nour walks together.\nOn the afternoon of the third day he suddenly informed me that he\nexpected his wife to arrive on that evening\u2019s express train. My\npsychologic interest was now aroused, as it had already struck me\nthat morning that my companion rejected my proposal to make a long\nexcursion, and in our short walk he objected to a certain path as too\nsteep and dangerous. During our afternoon walk he suddenly thought that\nI must be hungry and insisted that I should not delay my evening meal\non his account, that he would not sup before his wife\u2019s arrival. I\nunderstood the hint and seated myself at the table while he went to the\nstation.\nThe next morning we met in the foyer of the hotel. He presented me to\nhis wife, and added, \u201cOf course, you will breakfast with us?\u201d I had\nto attend first to a small matter in the next street, but assured him\nthat I would return shortly. Later, as I entered the breakfast-room,\nI noticed that the couple were at a small table near the window, both\nseated on the same side of it. On the opposite side there was only one\nchair, which was covered, however, with a man\u2019s large and heavy coat.\nI understood well the meaning of this unintentional, none the less\nexpressive, disposition of the coat. It meant this: \u201cThere is no room\nfor you here, you are superfluous now.\u201d\nThe man did not notice that I remained standing before the table, being\nunable to take the seat, but his wife noticed it, and quickly nudged\nher husband and whispered: \u201cWhy, you have covered the gentleman\u2019s place\nwith your coat.\u201d\nThese as well as other similar experiences have caused me to think that\nthe actions executed unintentionally must inevitably become the source\nof misunderstanding in human relations. The perpetrator of the act, who\nis unaware of any associated intention, takes no account of it, and\ndoes not hold himself responsible for it. On the other hand, the second\nparty, having regularly utilized even such acts as those of his partner\nto draw conclusions as to their purpose and meaning, recognizes more\nof the stranger\u2019s psychic processes than the latter is ready either to\nadmit or believe that he has imparted. He becomes indignant when these\nconclusions drawn from his symptomatic actions are held up to him; he\ndeclares them baseless because he does not see any conscious intention\nin their execution, and complains of being misunderstood by the other.\nClose examination shows that such misunderstandings are based on the\nfact that the person is too fine an observer and understands too much.\nThe more \u201cnervous\u201d two persons are the more readily will they give\neach other cause for disputes, which are based on the fact that one as\ndefinitely denies about his own person what he is sure to accept about\nthe other.\nAnd this is, indeed, the punishment for the inner dishonesty to which\npeople grant expression under the guise of \u201cforgetting,\u201d of erroneous\nactions and accidental emotions, a feeling which they would do better\nto confess to themselves and others when they can no longer control\nit. As a matter of fact it can be generally affirmed that every one\nis continually practising psychoanalysis on his neighbours, and\nconsequently learns to know them better than each individual knows\nhimself. The road following the admonition \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1f41\u03bd leads through\nthe study of one\u2019s own apparently casual commissions and omissions.\nX\nERRORS\nErrors of memory are distinguished from forgetting and false\nrecollections through one feature only, namely, that the error (false\nrecollection) is not recognized as such but finds credence. However,\nthe use of the expression \u201cerror\u201d seems to depend on still another\ncondition. We speak of \u201cerring\u201d instead of \u201cfalsely recollecting\u201d where\nthe character of the objective reality is emphasized in the psychic\nmaterial to be reproduced--that is, where something other than a fact\nof my own psychic life is to be remembered, or rather something that\nmay be confirmed or refuted through the memory of others. The reverse\nof the error in memory in this sense is formed by ignorance.\nIn my book _The Interpretation of Dreams_,[61] I was responsible for\na series of errors in historical, and above all, in material facts,\nwhich I was astonished to discover after the appearance of the book.\nOn closer examination I found that they did not originate from my\nignorance, but could be traced to errors of memory explainable by means\nof analysis.\n(_a_) On page 361 I indicated as _Schiller\u2019s_ birthplace the city of\n_Marburg_, a name which recurs in _Styria_. The error is found in the\nanalysis of a dream during a night journey from which I was awakened\nby the conductor calling out the name of the station _Marburg_. In the\ncontents of the dream inquiry is made concerning a book by _Schiller_.\nBut _Schiller_ was not born in the university town of _Marburg_ but in\nthe Swabian city _Marbach_. I maintain that I always knew this.\n(_b_) On page 165 _Hannibal\u2019s_ father is called _Hasdrubal_. This error\nwas particularly annoying to me, but it was most corroborative of my\nconception of such errors. Few readers of the book are better posted\non the history of the _Barkides_ than the author who wrote this error\nand overlooked it in three proofs. The name of Hannibal\u2019s father was\n_Hamilcar Barkas_; _Hasdrubal_ was the name of _Hannibal\u2019s_ brother as\nwell as that of his brother-in-law and predecessor in command.\n(_c_) On pages 217 and 492 I assert that _Zeus_ emasculates his father\n_Kronos_, and hurls him from the throne. This horror I have erroneously\nadvanced by a generation; according to Greek mythology it was _Kronos_\nwho committed this on his father _Uranos_.[62]\nHow is it to be explained that my memory furnished me with false\nmaterial on these points, while it usually places the most remote and\nunusual material at my disposal, as the readers of my books can verify?\nAnd, what is more, in three carefully executed proof-readings I passed\nover these errors as if struck blind.\nGoethe said of Lichtenberg: \u201cWhere he cracks a joke, there lies a\nconcealed problem.\u201d Similarly we can affirm of these passages cited\nfrom my book: back of every error is a repression. More accurately\nstated: the error conceals a falsehood, a disfigurement which is\nultimately based on repressed material. In the analysis of the dreams\nthere reported, I was compelled by the very nature of the theme to\nwhich the dream thoughts related, on the one hand, to break off the\nanalysis in some places before it had reached its completion, and\non the other hand, to remove an indiscreet detail through a slight\ndisfigurement of its outline. I could not act differently, and had no\nother choice if I was at all to offer examples and illustrations. My\nconstrained position was necessarily brought about by the peculiarity\nof dreams, which give expression to repressed thoughts, or to material\nwhich is incapable of becoming conscious. In spite of this it is said\nthat enough material remained to offend the more sensitive souls. The\ndisfigurement or concealment of the continuing thoughts known to me\ncould not be accomplished without leaving some trace. What I wished to\nrepress has often against my will obtruded itself on what I have taken\nup, and evinced itself in the matter as an unnoticeable error. Indeed,\neach of the three examples given is based on the same theme: the errors\nare the results of repressed thoughts which occupy themselves with my\ndeceased father.\n(_ad a_) Whoever reads through the dream analysed on page 361 will\nfind some parts unveiled; in some parts he will be able to divine\nthrough allusions that I have broken off the thoughts which would have\ncontained an unfavourable criticism of my father. In the continuation\nof this line of thoughts and memories there lies an annoying tale, in\nwhich books and a business friend of my father, named _Marburg_, play\na part; it is the same name the calling out of which in the southern\nrailway-station had aroused me from sleep. I wished to suppress this\nMr. _Marburg_ in the analysis from myself and my readers: he avenged\nhimself by intruding where he did not belong, and changed the name of\nSchiller\u2019s birthplace from _Marbach_ to _Marburg_.\n(_ad b_) The error _Hasdrubal_ in place of _Hamilcar_, the name of the\nbrother instead of that of the father, originated from an association\nwhich dealt with the Hannibal fantasies of my college years and my\ndissatisfaction with the conduct of my father towards the \u201cenemies\nof our people.\u201d I could have continued and recounted how my attitude\ntoward my father was changed by a visit to England, where I made the\nacquaintance of my half-brother, by a previous marriage of my father.\nMy brother\u2019s oldest son was my age exactly. Thus the age relations were\nno hindrance to a fantasy which may be stated thus: how much pleasanter\nit would be had I been born the son of my brother instead of the son of\nmy father! This suppressed fantasy then falsified the text of my book\nat the point where I broke off the analysis, by forcing me to put the\nname of the brother for that of the father.\n(_ad c_) The influence of the memory of this same brother is\nresponsible for my having advanced by a generation the mythological\nhorror of the Greek deities. One of the admonitions of my brother has\nlingered long in my memory. \u201cDo not forget one thing concerning your\nconduct in life,\u201d he said: \u201cyou belong not to the second but really\nto the third generation of your father.\u201d Our father had remarried at\nan advanced age, and was therefore an old man to his children by the\nsecond marriage. I commit the error mentioned where I discuss the\npiety between parents and children.\nSeveral times friends and patients have called my attention to the fact\nthat in reporting their dreams or alluding to them in dream analyses,\nI have related inaccurately the circumstances experienced by us in\ncommon. These are also historic errors. On re-examining such individual\ncases I have found that my recollection of the facts was unreliable\nonly where I had purposely disfigured or concealed something in the\nanalysis. Here again we have _an unobserved error as a substitute for\nan intentional concealment or repression_.\nFrom these errors, which originate from repression, we must sharply\ndistinguish those which are based on actual ignorance. Thus, for\nexample, it was ignorance when on my excursion to Wachau I believed\nthat I had passed the resting-place of the revolutionary leader\nFischof. Only the name is common to both places. _Fischof\u2019s Emmersdorf_\nis located in K\u00e4rnthen. But I did not know any better.\nHere is another embarrassing but instructive error, an example of\ntemporary ignorance if you like. One day a patient reminded me to give\nhim the two books on Venice which I had promised him, as he wished to\nuse them in planning his Easter tour. I answered that I had them ready\nand went into the library to fetch them, though the truth of the\nmatter was that I had forgotten to look them up, since I did not quite\napprove of my patient\u2019s journey, looking upon it as an unnecessary\ninterruption to the treatment, and as a material loss to the physician.\nThereupon I made a quick survey of the library for the books.\nOne was _Venedig als Kunstst\u00e4tte_, and besides this I imagined I had an\nhistoric work of a similar order. Certainly there was _Die Mediceer_\n(_The Medicis_); I took them and brought them in to him, then,\nembarrassed, I confessed my error. Of course I really knew that the\nMedicis had nothing to do with Venice, but for a short time it did not\nappear to me at all incorrect. Now I was compelled to practise justice;\nas I had so frequently interpreted my patient\u2019s symptomatic actions I\ncould save my prestige only by being honest and admitting to him the\nsecret motives of my averseness to his trip.\nIt may cause general astonishment to learn how much stronger is the\nimpulse to tell the truth than is usually supposed. Perhaps it is a\nresult of my occupation with psychoanalysis that I can scarcely lie any\nmore. As often as I attempt a distortion I succumb to an error or some\nother faulty act, which betrays my dishonesty, as was manifest in this\nand in the preceding examples.\nOf all faulty actions the mechanism of the error seems to be the most\nsuperficial. That is, the occurrence of the error invariably indicates\nthat the mental activity concerned had to struggle with some disturbing\ninfluence, although the nature of the error need not be determined by\nthe quality of the disturbing idea, which may have remained obscure.\nIt is not out of place to add that the same state of affairs may be\nassumed in many simple cases of lapses in speaking and writing. Every\ntime we commit a lapse in speaking or writing we may conclude that\nthrough mental processes there has come a disturbance which is beyond\nour intention. It may be conceded, however, that lapses in speaking\nand writing often follow the laws of similarity and convenience, or\nthe tendency to acceleration, without allowing the disturbing element\nto leave a trace of its own character in the error resulting from\nthe lapses in speaking or writing. It is the responsiveness of the\nlinguistic material which at first makes possible the determination of\nthe error, but it also limits the same.\nIn order not to confine myself exclusively to personal errors I will\nrelate a few examples which could just as well have been ranged under\n\u201cLapses in Speech\u201d or under \u201cErroneously Carried-out Actions,\u201d but as\nall these forms of faulty action have the same value they may as well\nbe reported here.\n(_a_) I forbade a patient to speak on the telephone to his lady-love,\nwith whom he himself was willing to break off all relations, as each\nconversation only renewed the struggling against it. He was to write\nher his final decision, although there were some difficulties in the\nway of delivering the letter to her. He visited me at one o\u2019clock to\ntell me that he had found a way of avoiding these difficulties, and\namong other things he asked me whether he might refer to me in my\nprofessional capacity.\nAt two o\u2019clock while he was engaged in composing the letter of refusal,\nhe interrupted himself suddenly, and said to his mother, \u201cWell, I\nhave forgotten to ask the Professor whether I may use his name in the\nletter.\u201d He hurried to the telephone, got the connection, and asked the\nquestion, \u201cMay I speak to the Professor after his dinner?\u201d In answer\nhe got an astonished \u201cAdolf, have you gone crazy!\u201d The answering voice\nwas the very voice which at my command he had listened to for the last\ntime. He had simply \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d and in place of the physician\u2019s\nnumber had called up that of his beloved.\n(_b_) During a summer vacation a schoolteacher, a poor but excellent\nyoung man, courted the daughter of a summer resident, until the girl\nfell passionately in love with him, and even prevailed upon her family\nto countenance the matrimonial alliance in spite of the difference in\nposition and race. One day, however, the teacher wrote his brother a\nletter in which he said: \u201cPretty, the lass is not at all, but she is\nvery amiable, and so far so good. But whether I can make up my mind to\nmarry a Jewess I cannot yet tell.\u201d This letter got into the hands of\nthe fianc\u00e9e, who put an end to the engagement, while at the same time\nhis brother was wondering at the protestations of love directed to him.\nMy informer assured me that this was really an error and not a cunning\ntrick.\nI am familiar with another case in which a woman who was dissatisfied\nwith her old physician, and still did not openly wish to discharge him,\naccomplished this purpose through the interchange of letters. Here, at\nleast, I can assert confidently that it was error and not conscious\ncunning that made use of this familiar comedy-motive.\n(_c_) Brill[63] tells of a woman who, inquiring about a mutual friend,\nerroneously called her by her maiden name. Her attention having been\ndirected to this error, she had to admit that she disliked her friend\u2019s\nhusband and had never been satisfied with her marriage.\nMaeder[64] relates a good example of how a reluctantly repressed\nwish can be satisfied by means of an \u201cerror.\u201d A colleague wanted\nto enjoy his day of leave of absence absolutely undisturbed, but he\nalso felt that he ought to go to Lucerne to pay a call which he did\nnot anticipate with any pleasure. After long reflection, however, he\nconcluded to go. For pastime on the train he read the daily newspapers.\nHe journeyed from Zurich to Arth Goldau, where he changed trains for\nLucerne, all the time engrossed in reading. Presently the conductor\ninformed him that he was in the wrong train--that is, he had got into\nthe one which was returning from Goldau to Zurich, whereas his ticket\nwas for Lucerne.\nA very similar trick was played by me quite recently. I had promised my\noldest brother to pay him a long-due visit at a sea-shore in England;\nas the time was short I felt obliged to travel by the shortest route\nand without interruption. I begged for a day\u2019s sojourn in Holland,\nbut he thought that I could stop there on my return trip. Accordingly\nI journeyed from Munich through Cologne to Rotterdam--Hook of\nHolland--where I was to take the steamer at midnight to Harwich. In\nCologne I had to change cars; I left my train to go into the Rotterdam\nexpress, but it was not to be found. I asked various railway employees,\nwas sent from one platform to another, got into an exaggerated state of\ndespair, and could easily reckon that during this fruitless search I\nhad probably missed my connection.\nAfter this was corroborated, I pondered whether or not I should spend\nthe night in Cologne. This was favoured by a feeling of piety, for\naccording to an old family tradition, my ancestors were once expelled\nfrom this city during a persecution of the Jews. But eventually I\ncame to another decision; I took a later train to Rotterdam, where I\narrived late at night and was thus compelled to spend a day in Holland.\nThis brought me the fulfilment of a long-fostered wish--the sight\nof the beautiful Rembrandt paintings at The Hague and in the Royal\nMuseum at Amsterdam. Not before the next forenoon, while collecting my\nimpressions during the railway journey in England, did I definitely\nremember that only a few steps from the place where I got off at the\nrailroad station in Cologne, indeed, on the same platform, I had seen\na large sign, \u201cRotterdam--Hook of Holland.\u201d There stood the train in\nwhich I should have continued my journey.\nIf one does not wish to assume that, contrary to my brother\u2019s orders, I\nhad really resolved to admire the Rembrandt pictures on my way to him,\nthen the fact that despite clear directions I hurried away and looked\nfor another train must be designated as an incomprehensible \u201cblinding.\u201d\nEverything else--my well-acted perplexity, the emergence of the pious\nintention to spend the night in Cologne--was only a contrivance to hide\nmy resolution until it had been fully accomplished.\nOne may possibly be disinclined to consider the class of errors which I\nhave here explained as very numerous or particularly significant. But I\nleave it to your consideration whether there is no ground for extending\nthe same points of view also to the more important errors of judgment,\nas evinced by people in life and science. Only for the most select\nand most balanced minds does it seem possible to guard the perceived\npicture of external reality against the distortion to which it is\notherwise subjected in its transit through the psychic individuality of\nthe one perceiving it.\nXI\nCOMBINED FAULTY ACTS\nTwo of the last-mentioned examples, my error which transfers the\nMedici to Venice and that of the young man who knew how to circumvent\na command against a conversation on the telephone with his lady love,\nhave really not been fully discussed, as after careful consideration\nthey may be shown to represent a union of forgetting with an error. I\ncan show the same union still more clearly in certain other examples.\n(_a_) A friend related to me the following experience: \u201cSome years\nago I consented to be elected to the committee of a certain literary\nsociety, as I supposed the organization might some time be of use to\nme in assisting me in the production of my drama. Although not much\ninterested, I attended the meetings regularly every Friday. Some months\nago I was definitely assured that one of my dramas would be presented\nat the theatre in F., and since that time it regularly happened that\nI forgot the meeting of the association. As I read their programme\nannouncements I was ashamed of my forgetfulness. I reproached myself,\nfeeling that it was certainly rude of me to stay away now when I no\nlonger needed them, and determined that I would certainly not forget\nthe next Friday. Continually I reminded myself of this resolution\nuntil the hour came and I stood before the door of the meeting-room.\nTo my astonishment it was locked; the meeting was already over. I had\nmistaken my day; it was already Saturday!\u201d\n(_b_) The next example is the combination of a symptomatic action\nwith a case of mislaying; it reached me by remote byways, but from a\nreliable source.\nA woman travelled to Rome with her brother-in-law, a renowned artist.\nThe visitor was highly honoured by the German residents of Rome, and\namong other things received a gold medal of antique origin. The woman\nwas grieved that her brother-in-law did not sufficiently appreciate\nthe value of this beautiful gift. After she had returned home she\ndiscovered in unpacking that--without knowing how--she had brought the\nmedal home with her. She immediately notified her brother-in-law of\nthis by letter, and informed him that she would send it back to Rome\nthe next day. The next day, however, the medal was so aptly mislaid\nthat it could not be found and could not be sent back, and then it\ndawned on the woman what her \u201cabsent-mindedness\u201d signified--namely,\nthat she wished to keep the medal herself.\n(_c_) Here are some cases in which the falsified action persistently\nrepeats itself, and at the same time also changes its mode of action:--\nDue to unknown motives, Jones[65] left a letter for several days on his\ndesk, forgetting each time to post it. He ultimately posted it, but\nit was returned to him from the Dead-letter Office because he forgot\nto address it. After addressing and posting it a second time it was\nagain returned to him, this time without a stamp. He was then forced to\nrecognize the unconscious opposition to the sending of the letter.\n(_d_) A short account by Dr. Karl Weiss (Vienna)[66] of a case of\nforgetting impressively describes the futile effort to accomplish\nsomething in the face of opposition. \u201cHow persistently the unconscious\nactivity can achieve its purpose if it has cause to prevent a\nresolution from being executed, and how difficult it is to guard\nagainst this tendency, will be illustrated by the following incident:\nAn acquaintance requested me to lend him a book and bring it to him the\nnext day. I immediately promised it, but perceived a distinct feeling\nof displeasure which I could not explain at the time. Later it became\nclear to me: this acquaintance had owed me for years a sum of money\nwhich he evidently had no intention of returning. I did not give this\nmatter any more thought, but I recalled it the following forenoon with\nthe same feeling of displeasure, and at once said to myself: \u2018Your\nunconscious will see to it that you forget the book, but you don\u2019t wish\nto appear unobliging and will therefore do everything not to forget\nit.\u2019 I came home, wrapped the book in paper, and put it near me on the\ndesk while I wrote some letters.\n\u201cA little later I went away, but after a few steps I recollected that I\nhad left on the desk the letters which I wished to post. (By the way,\none of the letters was written to a person who urged me to undertake\nsomething disagreeable.) I returned, took the letters, and again left.\nWhile in the street-car it occurred to me that I had undertaken to\npurchase something for my wife, and I was pleased at the thought that\nit would be only a small package. The association, \u2018small package,\u2019\nsuddenly recalled \u2018book\u2019--and only then I noticed that I did not have\nthe book with me. Not only had I forgotten it when I left my home the\nfirst time, but I had overlooked it again when I got the letters near\nwhich it lay.\u201d\n(_e_) A similar mechanism is shown in the following fully analysed\nobservation of Otto Rank[67]:--\n\u201cA scrupulously orderly and pedantically precise man reported the\nfollowing occurrence, which he considered quite remarkable: One\nafternoon on the street wishing to find out the time, he discovered\nthat he had left his watch at home, an omission which to his knowledge\nhad never occurred before. As he had an engagement elsewhere and had\nnot enough time to return for his watch, he made use of a visit to a\nwoman friend to borrow her watch for the evening. This was the most\nconvenient way out of the dilemma, as he had a previous engagement to\nvisit this lady the next day. Accordingly, he promised to return her\nwatch at that time.\n\u201cBut the following day when about to consummate this he found to his\nsurprise that he had left the watch at home; his own watch he had with\nhim. He then firmly resolved to return the lady\u2019s property that same\nafternoon, and even followed out his resolution. But on wishing to see\nthe time on leaving her he found to his chagrin and astonishment that\nhe had again forgotten to take his own watch.\n\u201cThe repetition of this faulty action seemed so pathologic to this\norder-loving man that he was quite anxious to know its psychologic\nmotivation, and when questioned whether he experienced anything\ndisagreeable on the critical day of the first forgetting, and in what\nconnection it had occurred, the motive was promptly found. He related\nthat he had conversed with his mother after luncheon, shortly before\nleaving the house. She told him that an irresponsible relative, who had\nalready caused him much worry and loss of money, had pawned his (the\nrelative\u2019s) watch, and, as it was needed in the house, the relative had\nasked for money to redeem it. This almost \u201cforced\u201d loan affected our\nman very painfully and brought back to his memory all the disagreeable\nepisodes perpetrated by this relative for many years.\n\u201cHis symptomatic action therefore proves to be manifoldly determined.\nFirst, it gives expression to a stream of thought which runs perhaps\nas follows: \u2018I won\u2019t allow my money to be extorted this way, and if\na watch is needed I will leave my own at home.\u2019 But as he needed it\nfor the evening to keep his appointment, this intention could only\nbe brought about on an unconscious path in the form of a symptomatic\naction. Second, the forgetting expresses a sentiment something like\nthe following: \u2018This everlasting sacrificing of money for this\ngood-for-nothing is bound to ruin me altogether, so that I will have to\ngive up everything.\u2019 Although the anger, according to the report of\nthis man, was only momentary, the repetition of the same symptomatic\naction conclusively shows that in the unconscious it continued to act\nmore intensely, and may be equivalent to the conscious expression:\n\u2018I cannot get this story out of my head.[68] That the lady\u2019s watch\nshould later meet the same fate will not surprise us after knowing this\nattitude of the unconscious.\u2019\n\u201cYet there may be still other special motives which favour the\ntransference on the \u2018innocent\u2019 lady\u2019s watch. The nearest motive is\nprobably that he would have liked to keep it as a substitute for his\nown sacrificed watch, and that hence he forgot to return it the next\nday. He also might have liked to possess this watch as a souvenir of\nthe lady. Moreover, the forgetting of the lady\u2019s watch gave him the\nexcuse for calling on the admired one a second time; for he was obliged\nto visit her in the morning in reference to another matter, and with\nthe forgetting of the watch he seemed to indicate that this visit for\nwhich an appointment had been made so long ago was too good for him to\nbe used simply for the return of a watch.\n\u201cTwice forgetting his own watch and thus making possible the\nsubstitution of the lady\u2019s watch speaks for the fact that our man\nunconsciously endeavoured to avoid carrying both watches at the same\ntime. He obviously thought of avoiding the appearance of superfluity\nwhich would have stood out in striking contrast to the want of the\nrelative; but, on the other hand, he utilized this as a self-admonition\nagainst his apparent intention to marry this lady, reminding himself\nthat he was tied to his family (mother) by indissoluble obligations.\n\u201cFinally, another reason for the forgetting of the lady\u2019s watch may be\nsought in the fact that the evening before he, a bachelor, was ashamed\nto be seen with a lady\u2019s watch by his friends, so that he only looked\nat it stealthily, and in order to evade the repetition of this painful\nsituation he could not take the watch along. But as he was obliged\nto return it, there resulted here, too, an unconsciously performed\nsymptomatic action which proved to be a compromise formation between\nconflicting emotional feelings and a dearly bought victory of the\nunconscious instance.\u201d\nIn the same discussion Rank has also paid attention to the very\ninteresting relation of \u201cfaulty actions and dreams,\u201d which cannot,\nhowever, be followed here without a comprehensive analysis of the dream\nwith which the faulty action is connected. I once dreamed at great\nlength that I had lost my pocket-book. In the morning while dressing I\nactually missed it; while undressing the night before the dream I had\nforgotten to take it out of my trousers pocket and put it in its usual\nplace. This forgetting was therefore not unknown to me; probably it was\nto give expression to an unconscious thought which was ready to appear\nin the dream content.\nI do not mean to assert that such cases of combined faulty actions can\nteach anything new that we have not already seen in the individual\ncases. But this change in form of the faulty action, which nevertheless\nattains the same result, gives the plastic impression of a will working\ntowards a definite end, and in a far more energetic way contradicts\nthe idea that the faulty action represents something fortuitous and\nrequires no explanation. Not less remarkable is the fact that the\nconscious intention thoroughly fails to check the success of the faulty\naction. Despite all, my friend did not pay his visit to the meeting\nof the literary society, and the woman found it impossible to give\nup the medal. That unconscious something which worked against these\nresolutions found another outlet after the first road was closed to it.\nIt requires something other than the conscious counter-resolution to\novercome the unknown motive; it requires a psychic work which makes the\nunknown known to consciousness.\nXII\nDETERMINISM--CHANCE--AND SUPERSTITIOUS BELIEFS\nPOINTS OF VIEW.\nAs the general result of the preceding separate discussions we must\nput down the following principle: _Certain inadequacies of our psychic\ncapacities--whose common character will soon be more definitely\ndetermined--and certain performances which are apparently unintentional\nprove to be well motivated when subjected to the psychoanalytic\ninvestigation, and are determined through the consciousness of unknown\nmotives._\nIn order to belong to this class of phenomena thus explained a faulty\npsychic action must satisfy the following conditions:--\n(_a_) It must not exceed a certain measure, which is firmly established\nthrough our estimation, and is designated by the expression \u201cwithin\nnormal limits.\u201d\n(_b_) It must evince the character of the momentary and temporary\ndisturbance. The same action must have been previously performed more\ncorrectly or we must always rely on ourselves to perform it more\ncorrectly; if we are corrected by others we must immediately recognize\nthe truth of the correction and the incorrectness of our psychic action.\n(_c_) If we at all perceive a faulty action, we must not perceive in\nourselves any motivation of the same, but must attempt to explain it\nthrough \u201cinattention\u201d or attribute it to an \u201caccident.\u201d\nThus there remain in this group the cases of forgetting and the errors,\ndespite better knowledge, the lapses in speaking, reading, writing, the\nerroneously carried-out actions, and the so-called chance actions. The\nexplanations of these so definite psychic processes are connected with\na series of observations which may in part arouse further interest.\nI. By abandoning a part of our psychic capacity as unexplainable\nthrough purposive ideas we ignore the realms of determinism in our\nmental life. Here, as in still other spheres, determinism reaches\nfarther than we suppose. In the year 1900 I read an essay published\nin the _Zeit_ written by the literary historian R. M. Meyer, in which\nhe maintains, and illustrates by examples, that it is impossible to\ncompose nonsense intentionally and arbitrarily. For some time I have\nbeen aware that it is impossible to think of a number, or even of\na name, of one\u2019s own free will. If one investigates this seeming\nvoluntary formation, let us say, of a number of many digits uttered\nin unrestrained mirth, it always proves to be so strictly determined\nthat the determination seems impossible. I will now briefly discuss an\nexample of an \u201carbitrarily chosen\u201d first name, and then exhaustively\nanalyse an analogous example of a \u201cthoughtlessly uttered\u201d number.\nWhile preparing the history of one of my patients for publication I\nconsidered what first name I should give her in the article. There\nseemed to be a wide choice; of course, certain names were at once\nexcluded by me, in the first place the real name, then the names of\nmembers of my family to which I would have objected, also some female\nnames having an especially peculiar pronunciation. But, excluding\nthese, there should have been no need of being puzzled about such\na name. It would be thought, and I myself supposed, that a whole\nmultitude of feminine names would be placed at my disposal. Instead of\nthis only one sprang up, no other besides it; it was the name Dora.\nI inquired as to its determination: \u201cWho else is called Dora?\u201d I wished\nto reject the next idea as incredulous; it occurred to me that the\nnurse of my sister\u2019s children was named Dora. But I possess so much\nself-control, or practice in analysis, if you like, that I held firmly\nto the idea and proceeded. Then a slight incident of the previous\nevening soon flashed through my mind which brought the looked-for\ndetermination. On my sister\u2019s dining-room table I noticed a letter\nbearing the address, \u201cMiss Rosa W.\u201d Astonished, I asked whose name this\nwas, and was informed that the right name of the supposed Dora was\nreally Rosa, and that on accepting the position she had to lay aside\nher name, because Rosa would also refer to my sister. I said pityingly,\n\u201cPoor people! They cannot even retain their own names!\u201d I now recall\nthat on hearing this I became quiet for a moment and began to think of\nall sorts of serious matters which merged into the obscure, but which\nI could now easily bring into my consciousness. Thus when I sought a\nname for a person _who could not retain her own name_ no other except\n\u201cDora\u201d occurred to me. The exclusiveness here is based, moreover, on\nfirmer internal associations, for in the history of my patient it was a\nstranger in the house, the governess, who exerted a decisive influence\non the course of the treatment.\nThis slight incident found its unexpected continuation many years\nlater. While discussing in a lecture the long-since published history\nof the girl called Dora it occurred to me that one of my two women\npupils had the very name Dora which I was obliged to utter so often in\nthe different associations of the case. I turned to the young student,\nwhom I knew personally, with the apology that I had really not thought\nthat she bore the same name, and that I was ready to substitute it in\nmy lecture by another name.\nI was now confronted with the task of rapidly choosing another name,\nand reflected that I must not now choose the first name of the other\nwoman student, and so set a poor example to the class, who were already\nquite conversant with psychoanalysis. I was therefore well pleased when\nthe name \u201cErna\u201d occurred to me as the substitute for Dora, and Erna I\nused in the discourse. After the lecture I asked myself whence the name\n\u201cErna\u201d could possibly have originated, and had to laugh as I observed\nthat the feared possibility in the choice of the substitutive name\nhad come to pass, in part at least. The other lady\u2019s family name was\nLucerna, of which Erna was a part.\nIn a letter to a friend I informed him that I had finished reading the\nproof-sheets of _The Interpretation of Dreams_, and that I did not\nintend to make any further changes in it, \u201ceven if it contained _2,467_\nmistakes.\u201d I immediately attempted to explain to myself the number,\nand added this little analysis as a postscript to the letter. It will\nbe best to quote it now as I wrote it when I caught myself in this\ntransaction:--\n\u201cI will add hastily another contribution to the Psychopathology of\nEveryday Life. You will find in the letter the number 2,467 as a\njocose and arbitrary estimation of the number of errors that may be\nfound in the dream-book. I meant to write: no matter how large the\nnumber might be, and this one presented itself. But there is nothing\narbitrary or undetermined in the psychic life. You will therefore\nrightly suppose that the unconscious hastened to determine the number\nwhich was liberated by consciousness. Just previous to this I had read\nin the paper that General E. M. had been retired as Inspector-General\nof Ordnance. You must know that I am interested in this man. While I\nwas serving as military medical student he, then a colonel, once came\ninto the hospital and said to the physician: \u2018You must make me well in\neight days, as I have some work to do for which the Emperor is waiting.\u2019\n\u201cAt that time I decided to follow this man\u2019s career, and just think,\nto-day (1899) he is at the end of it--Inspector-General of Ordnance\nand already retired. I wished to figure out in what time he had\ncovered this road, and assumed that I had seen him in the hospital in\n1882. That would make 17 years. I related this to my wife, and she\nremarked, \u2018Then you, too, should be retired.\u2019 And I protested, \u2018The\nLord forbid!\u2019 After this conversation I seated myself at the table to\nwrite to you. The previous train of thought continued, and for good\nreason. The figuring was incorrect; I had a definite recollection of\nthe circumstances in my mind. I had celebrated my coming of age, my\n_24th_ birthday, in the military prison (for being absent without\npermission). Therefore I must have seen him in 1880, which makes it 19\nyears ago. You then have the number 24 in 2,467! Now take the number\nthat represents my age, 43, and add 24 years to it and you get _67_!\nThat is, to the question whether I wished to retire I had expressed the\nwish to work 24 years more. Obviously I am annoyed that in the interval\nduring which I followed Colonel M. I have not accomplished much myself,\nand still there is a sort of triumph in the fact that he is already\nfinished, while I still have all before me. Thus we may justly say\nthat not even the unintentionally thrown-out number 2,467 lacks its\ndetermination from the unconscious.\u201d\nSince this first example of the interpretation of an apparently\narbitrary choice of a number I have repeated a similar test with the\nsame result; but most cases are of such intimate content that they do\nnot lend themselves to report.\nIt is for this reason that I shall not hesitate to add here a very\ninteresting analysis of a \u201cchance number\u201d which Dr. Alfred Adler\n(Vienna) received from a \u201cperfectly healthy\u201d man.[69] A. wrote to\nme: \u201cLast night I devoted myself to the _Psychopathology of Everyday_\nLife, and I would have read it all through had I not been hindered\nby a remarkable coincidence. When I read that every number that we\napparently conjure up quite arbitrarily in our consciousness has a\ndefinite meaning, I decided to test it. The number 1,734 occurred\nto my mind. The following associations then came up: 1,734 \u00f7 17 =\n102; 102 \u00f7 17 = 6. I then separated the number into 17 and 34. I am\n34 years old. I believe that I once told you that I consider 34 the\nlast year of youth, and for this reason I felt miserable on my last\nbirthday. The end of my 17th year was the beginning of a very nice and\ninteresting period of my development. I divide my life into periods of\n17 years. What do the divisions signify? The number 102 recalls the\nfact that volume 102 of the Reclam Universal Library is Kotzebue\u2019s play\n_Menschenhass und Reue_ (_Human Hatred and Repentance_).\n\u201cMy present psychic state is \u2018human hatred and repentance.\u2019 No. 6 of\nthe U. L. (I know a great many numbers by heart) is Mullner\u2019s \u2018Schuld\u2019\n(Fault). I am constantly annoyed at the thought that it is through\nmy own fault that I have not become what I could have been with my\nabilities.\n\u201cI then asked myself, \u2018What is No. 17 of the U. L.?\u2019 But I could not\nrecall it. But as I positively knew it before, I assumed that I wished\nto forget this number. All reflection was in vain. I wished to continue\nwith my reading, but I read only mechanically without understanding\na word, for I was annoyed by the number 17. I extinguished the light\nand continued my search. It finally came to me that number 17 must be\na play by Shakespeare. But which one? I thought of Hero and Leander.\nApparently a stupid attempt of my will to distract me. I finally arose\nand consulted the catalogue of the U. L. Number 17 was _Macbeth_! To my\nsurprise I had to discover that I knew nothing of the play, despite the\nfact that it did not interest me any less than any other Shakespearean\ndrama. I only thought of: murder, Lady Macbeth, witches, \u2018nice is\nugly,\u2019 and that I found Schiller\u2019s version of _Macbeth_ very nice.\nUndoubtedly I also wished to forget the play. Then it occurred to me\nthat 17 and 34 may be divided by 17 and result in 1 and 2. Numbers 1\nand 2 of the U. L. is Goethe\u2019s _Faust_. Formerly I found much of Faust\nin me.\u201d\nWe must regret that the discretion of the physician did not allow us\nto see the significance of ideas. Adler remarked that the man did not\nsucceed in the synthesis of his analysis. His association would hardly\nbe worth reporting unless their continuation would bring out something\nthat would give us the key to the understanding of the number 1,734 and\nthe whole series of ideas.\nTo quote further: \u201cTo be sure this morning I had an experience which\nspeaks much for the correctness of the Freudian conception. My wife,\nwhom I awakened through my getting up at night, asked me what I wanted\nwith the catalogue of the U. L. I told her the story. She found it all\npettifogging but--very interesting. _Macbeth_, which caused me so much\ntrouble, she simply passed over. She said that nothing came to her mind\nwhen she thought of a number. I answered, \u2018Let us try it.\u2019 She named\nthe number 117. To this I immediately replied: \u201817 refers to what I\njust told you; furthermore, I told you yesterday that if a wife is in\nthe 82nd year and the husband is in the 35th year it must be a gross\nmisunderstanding.\u2019 For the last few days I have been teasing my wife\nby maintaining that she was a little old mother of 82 years. 82 + 35 =\n117.\u201d\nThe man who did not know how to determine his own number at once\nfound the solution when his wife named a number which was apparently\narbitrarily chosen. As a matter of fact, the woman understood very well\nfrom which complex the number of her husband originated, and chose her\nown number from the same complex, which was surely common to both, as\nit dealt in his case with their relative ages. Now, we find it easy to\ninterpret the number that occurred to the man. As Dr. Adler indicates,\nit expressed a repressed wish of the husband which, fully developed,\nwould read: \u201cFor a man of 34 years as I am, only a woman of 17 would be\nsuitable.\u201d\nLest one should think too lightly of such \u201cplaying,\u201d I will add that I\nwas recently informed by Dr. Adler that a year after the publication of\nthis analysis the man was divorced from his wife.[70]\nAdler gives a similar explanation for the origin of obsessive numbers.\nAlso the choice of so-called \u201cfavourite numbers\u201d is not without\nrelation to the life of the person concerned, and does not lack a\ncertain psychologic interest. A gentleman who evinced a particular\npartiality for the numbers 17 and 19 could specify, after brief\nreflection, that at the age of 17 he attained the greatly longed-for\nacademic freedom by having been admitted to the university, that at 19\nhe made his first long journey, and shortly thereafter made his first\nscientific discovery. But the fixation of this preference followed\nlater, after two questionable affairs, when the same numbers were\ninvested with importance in his \u201clove-life.\u201d\nIndeed, even those numbers which we use in a particular connection\nextremely often and with apparent arbitrariness can be traced by\nanalysis to an unexpected meaning. Thus, one day it struck one of my\npatients that he was particularly fond of saying, \u201cI have already told\nyou this from 17 to 36 times.\u201d And he asked himself whether there was\nany motive for it. It soon occurred to him that he was born on the 27th\nday of the month, and that his younger brother was born on the 26th\nday of another month, and he had grounds for complaint that Fate had\nrobbed him of so many of the benefits of life only to bestow them on\nhis younger brother. Thus he represented this partiality of Fate by\ndeducting 10 from the date of his birth and adding it to the date of\nhis brother\u2019s birthday. I am the elder and yet am so \u201ccut short.\u201d\nI shall tarry a little longer at the analysis of chance numbers, for\nI know of no other individual observation which would so readily\ndemonstrate the existence of highly organized thinking processes of\nwhich consciousness has no knowledge. Moreover, there is no better\nexample of analysis in which the suggestion of the position, a frequent\naccusation, is so distinctly out of consideration. I shall therefore\nreport the analysis of a chance number of one of my patients (with\nhis consent), to which I will only add that he is the youngest of many\nchildren and that he lost his beloved father in his young years.\nWhile in a particularly happy mood he let the number _426,718_ come to\nhis mind, and put to himself the question, \u201cWell, what does it bring\nto your mind?\u201d First came a joke he had heard: \u201cIf your catarrh of the\nnose is treated by a doctor it lasts 42 days, if it is not treated it\nlasts--6 weeks.\u201d This corresponds to the first digit of the number (42\n= 6 \u00d7 7). During the obstruction that followed this first solution I\ncalled his attention to the fact that the number of six digits selected\nby him contains all the first numbers except 3 and 5. He at once found\nthe continuation of this solution:--\n\u201cWe were altogether 7 children, I was the youngest. Number 3 in the\norder of the children corresponds to my sister A., and 5 to my brother\nL.; both of them were my enemies. As a child I used to pray to the Lord\nevery night that He should take out of my life these two tormenting\nspirits. It seems to me that I have fulfilled for myself this wish: \u20183\u2019\nand \u20185,\u2019 the _evil_ brother and the hated sister, are omitted.\u201d\n\u201cIf the number stands for your sisters and brothers, what significance\nis there to 18 at the end? You were altogether only 7.\u201d\n\u201cI often thought if my father had lived longer I should not have been\nthe youngest child. If one more would have come, we should have been\n8, and there would have been a younger child, toward whom I could have\nplayed the r\u00f4le of the older one.\u201d\nWith this the number was explained, but we still wished to find the\nconnection between the first part of the interpretation and the part\nfollowing it. This came very readily from the condition required for\nthe last digits--if the father had lived longer. 42 = 6 \u00d7 7 signifies\nthe ridicule directed against the doctors who could not help the\nfather, and in this way expresses the wish for the continued existence\nof the father. The whole number really corresponds to the fulfilment of\nhis two wishes in reference to his family circle--namely, that both the\nevil brother and sister should die and that another little child should\nfollow him. Or, briefly expressed: _If only these two had died in place\nof my father!_[71]\nAnother analysis of numbers I take from Jones.[72] A gentleman of his\nacquaintance let the number 986 come to his mind, and defied him to\nconnect it to anything of special interest in his mind. \u201cSix years\nago, on the hottest day he could remember, he had seen a joke in an\nevening newspaper, which stated that the thermometer had stood at\n98\u00b76\u00b0 F., evidently an exaggeration of 98\u00b76\u00b0 F. We were at the time\nseated in front of a very hot fire, from which he had just drawn back,\nand he remarked, probably quite correctly, that the heat had aroused\nhis dormant memory. However, I was curious to know why this memory had\npersisted with such vividness as to be so readily brought out, for with\nmost people it surely would have been forgotten beyond recall, unless\nit had become associated with some other mental experience of more\nsignificance.\n\u201cHe told me that on reading the joke he had laughed uproariously, and\nthat on many subsequent occasions he had recalled it with great relish.\nAs the joke was obviously of an exceedingly tenuous nature, this\nstrengthened my expectation that more lay behind. His next thought was\nthe general reflection that the conception of heat had always greatly\nimpressed him, that heat was the most important thing in the universe,\nthe source of all life, and so on. This remarkable attitude of a quite\nprosaic young man certainly needed some explanation, so I asked him\nto continue his free associations. The next thought was of a factory\nstack which he could see from his bedroom window. He often stood of an\nevening watching the flame and smoke issuing out of it, and reflecting\non this deplorable waste of energy. Heat, flame, the source of life,\nthe waste of vital energy issuing from an upright, hollow tube--it\nwas not hard to divine from such associations that the ideas of heat\nand fire were unconsciously linked in his mind with the idea of love,\nas is so frequent in symbolic thinking, and that there was a strong\nmasturbation complex present, a conclusion that he presently confirmed.\u201d\nThose who wish to get a good impression of the way the material of\nnumbers becomes elaborated in the unconscious thinking, I refer to two\npapers by Jung[73] and Jones.[74]\nIn personal analysis of this kind two things were especially striking.\nFirst, the absolute somnambulistic certainty with which I attacked\nthe unknown objective point, merging into a mathematical train of\nthought, which later suddenly extended to the looked-for number, and\nthe rapidity with which the entire subsequent work was performed.\nSecondly, the fact that the numbers were always at the disposal of my\nunconscious mind, when as a matter of fact I am a poor mathematician\nand find it very difficult to consciously recall years, house numbers,\nand the like. Moreover, in these unconscious mental operations with\nfigures I found a tendency to superstition, the origin of which had\nlong remained unknown to me.\nIt will not surprise us to find that not only numbers but also mental\noccurrences of different kinds of words regularly prove on analytic\ninvestigation to be well determined.\nBrill relates: \u201cWhile working on the English edition of this book I was\nobsessed one morning with the strange word \u2018Cardillac.\u2019 Busily intent\non my work, I refused at first to pay attention to it, but, as is\nusually the case, I simply could not do anything else. \u2018Cardillac\u2019 was\nconstantly in my mind. Realizing that my refusal to recognize it was\nonly a resistance, I decided to analyse it. The following associations\noccurred to me: _Cardillac_, _cardiac_, _carrefour_, _Cadillac_.\n\u201c_Cardiac_ recalled cardalgia--heartache--a medical friend who had\nrecently told me confidentially that he feared that he had some cardiac\naffection because he had suffered some attacks of pain in the region\nof his heart. Knowing him so well, I at once rejected his theory, and\ntold him that his attacks were of a neurotic character, and that his\nother apparent physical ailments were also only the expression of his\nneurosis.\n\u201cI might add that just before telling me of his heart trouble he spoke\nof a business matter of vital interest to him which had suddenly come\nto naught. Being a man of unbounded ambitions, he was very depressed\nbecause of late he had suffered many similar reverses. His neurotic\nconflicts, however, had become manifest a few months before this\nmisfortune. Soon after his father\u2019s death had left a big business on\nhis hands. As the business could be continued only under my friend\u2019s\nmanagement, he was unable to decide whether to enter into commercial\nlife or continue his chosen career. His great ambition was to become a\nsuccessful medical practitioner, and although he had practised medicine\nsuccessfully for many years, he was not altogether satisfied with the\nfinancial fluctuations of his professional income. On the other hand,\nhis father\u2019s business promised him an assured, though limited, return.\nIn brief, he was \u2018at a crossing and did not know which way to turn.\u2019\n\u201cI then recalled the word _carrefour_, which is the French for\n\u2018crossing,\u2019 and it occurred to me that while working in a hospital\nin Paris I lived near the \u2018Carrefour St. Lazarre.\u2019 And now I could\nunderstand what relation all these associations had for me.\n\u201cWhen I resolved to leave the State Hospital I made the decision,\nfirst, because I desired to get married, and, secondly, because I\nwished to enter private practice. This brought up a new problem.\nAlthough my State hospital service was an absolute success, judging\nby promotions and so on, I felt like a great many others in the\nsame situation, namely, that my training was ill suited for private\npractice. To specialize in mental work was a daring undertaking for one\nwithout money and social connections. I also felt that the best I could\ndo for patients should they ever come my way would be to commit them to\none of the hospitals, as I had little confidence in the home treatment\nin vogue. In spite of the enormous advances made in recent years in\nmental work, the specialist is almost helpless when he is confronted\nwith the average case of insanity. This may be partially attributed\nto the fact that such cases are brought to him after they have fully\ndeveloped the psychosis when hospital treatment is imperative. Of the\ngreat army of milder mental disturbances, the so-called border-line\ncases, which make up the bulk of clinic and private work and which\nrightfully belong to the mental specialist, I knew very little, as\nthose patients rarely, or never, came to the State hospital, and what I\ndid know concerning the treatment of neurasthenia and psychasthenia was\nnot conducive to make me more hopeful of success in private practice.\n\u201cIt was in this state of mind that I came to Paris, where I hoped to\nlearn enough about the psychoneuroses to enable me to continue my\nspecialty in private practice, and yet feel that I could do something\nfor my patients. What I saw in Paris did not, however, help to change\nmy state of mind. There, too, most of the work was directed to dead\ntissues. The mental aspects, as such, received but scant attention.\nI was, therefore, seriously thinking of giving up my mental work for\nsome other specialty. As can be seen, I was confronted with a situation\nsimilar to the one of my medical friend. I, too, was at a crossing and\ndid not know which way to turn. My suspense was soon ended. One day\nI received a letter from my friend Professor Peterson, who, by the\nway, was responsible for my entering the State hospital service. In\nthis letter he advised me not to give up my work, and suggested the\npsychiatric clinic of Zurich, where he thought I could find what I\ndesired.\n\u201cBut what does _Cadillac_ mean? Cadillac is the name of a hotel and\nof an automobile. A few days before in a country place my medical\nfriend and I had been trying to hire an automobile, but there was none\nto be had. We both expressed the wish to own an automobile--again an\nunrealized ambition. I also recalled that the \u2018Carrefour St. Lazarre\u2019\nalways impressed me as being one of the busiest thoroughfares in Paris.\nIt was always congested with automobiles. Cadillac also recalled that\nonly a few days ago on the way to my clinic I noticed a large sign over\na building which announced that on a certain day \u2018this building was\nto be occupied by the Cadillac,\u2019 etc. This at first made me think of\nthe Cadillac Hotel, but on second sight I noticed that it referred to\nthe Cadillac motor-car. There was a sudden obstruction here for a few\nmoments. The word Cadillac reappeared and by sound association the word\n_catalogue_ occurred to me. This word brought back a very mortifying\noccurrence of recent origin, the motive of which is again blighted\nambition.\n\u201cWhen one wishes to report any auto-analysis he must be prepared to lay\nbare many intimate affairs of his own life. Any one reading carefully\nProfessor Freud\u2019s works cannot fail to become intimately acquainted\nwith him and his family. I have often been asked by persons who claim\nto have read and studied Freud\u2019s works such questions as: \u2018How old is\nFreud?\u2019 \u2018Is Freud married?\u2019 \u2018How many children has he?\u2019 etc. Whenever I\nhear these or similar questions I know that the questioner has either\nlied when he made these assertions, or, to be more charitable, that he\nis a very careless and superficial reader. All these questions and many\nmore are answered in Freud\u2019s works. Auto-analyses are autobiographies\n_par excellence_; but whereas the autobiographer may for definite\nreasons consciously and unconsciously hide many facts of his life, the\nauto-analyst not only tells the truth consciously, but perforce brings\nto light his whole intimate personality. It is for these reasons that\none finds it very unpleasant to report his own auto-analyses. However,\nas we often report our patients\u2019 unconscious productions, it is but\nfair that we should sacrifice ourselves on the altar of publicity when\noccasion demands. This is my apology for having thrust some of my\npersonal affairs on the reader, and for being obliged to continue a\nlittle longer in the same strain.\n\u201cBefore digressing with the last remarks I mentioned that the word\n_Cadillac_ brought the sound association _catalogue_. This association\nbrought back another important epoch in my life with which Professor\nPeterson is connected. Last May I was informed by the secretary of\nthe faculty that I was appointed chief of clinic of the department of\npsychiatry. I need hardly say that I was exceedingly pleased to be\nso honoured--in the first place because it was the realization of an\nambition which I dared entertain only under special euphoric states;\nand, secondly, it was a compensation for the many unmerited criticisms\nfrom those who are blindly and unreasonably opposing some of my work.\nSoon thereafter I called on the stenographer of the faculty and spoke\nto her about a correction to be made in my name as it was printed in\nthe catalogue. For some unknown reason (perhaps racial prejudice) this\nstenographer, a maiden lady, must have taken a dislike to me. For\nabout three years I repeatedly requested her to have this correction\nmade, but she had paid no attention to me. To be sure she always\npromised to attend to it, but the mistake remained uncorrected.\n\u201cWhen I saw her last May I again reminded her of this correction, and\nalso called her attention to the fact that as I had been appointed\nchief of clinic I was especially anxious to have my name correctly\nprinted in the catalogue. She apologized for her remissness and assured\nme that everything should be as I requested. Imagine my surprise and\nchagrin when on receiving the new catalogue I found that while the\ncorrection had been made in my name I was not listed as chief of\nclinic. When I asked her about this she was quite puzzled; she said\nshe had no idea that I had been appointed chief of clinic. She had to\nconsult the minutes of the faculty, written by herself, before she was\nconvinced of it. It should be noted that as recorder to the faculty it\nwas her duty to know all these things as soon as they transpired.[75]\nWhen she finally ascertained that I was right she was very apologetic\nand informed me that she would at once write to the superintendent of\nthe clinic to inform him of my appointment, something which she should\nhave done months before. Of course I gained nothing by her regrets and\napologies. The catalogue was published and those who read it did not\nfind my name in the desired place. I am chief of clinic in fact but not\nin name. Moreover, as the appointments are made only for one year, it\nis quite likely that my great ambition will never be actually realized.\n\u201cThus the obsessive neologism _cardillac_, which is a condensation\nof _cardiac_, _Cadillac_, and _catalogue_, contains some of the most\nimportant efforts of my medical experience. When I was almost at the\nend of this analysis I suddenly recalled a dream containing this\nneologism cardillac in which my wish was realized. My name appeared\nin its rightful place in the catalogue. The person who showed it to\nme in the dream was Professor Peterson. It was when I was at the\nfirst \u2018crossing\u2019 after I had graduated from the medical college that\nProfessor Peterson urged me to enter the hospital service. About\nfive years later while I was in the state of indecision which I have\ndescribed, it was Professor Peterson who advised me to go to the clinic\nof psychiatry at Zurich where through Bleuler and Jung I first became\nacquainted with Professor Freud and his works, and it was also through\nthe kind recommendation of Dr. Peterson that I was elevated to my\npresent position.\u201d\nI am indebted to Dr. Hitschman for the solution of another case in\nwhich a line of poetry repeatedly obtruded itself on the mind in a\ncertain place without showing any trace of its origin and relation.\nRelated by Dr. E.: \u201cSix years ago I travelled from Biarritz to San\nSebastian. The railroad crosses over the Bidassao--a river which here\nforms the boundary between France and Spain. On the bridge one has a\nsplendid view, on the one side of the broad valley and the Pyrenees\nand on the other of the sea. It was a beautiful, bright summer day;\neverything was filled with sun and light. I was on a vacation and\npleased with my trip to Spain. Suddenly the following words came to me:\n\u2018_But the soul is already free, floating on a sea of light._\u2019\n\u201cAt that time I was trying to remember where these lines came from,\nbut I could not remember; judging by the rhythm, the words must be a\npart of some poem, which, however, entirely escaped my memory. Later\nwhen the verse repeatedly came to my mind, I asked many people about it\nwithout receiving any information.\n\u201cLast year I crossed the same bridge on my return journey from Spain.\nIt was a very dark night and it rained. I looked through the window\nto ascertain whether we had already reached the frontier station\nand noticed that we were on the Bidassao bridge. Immediately the\nabove-cited verse returned to my memory and again I could not recall\nits origin.\n\u201cAt home many months later I found Uhland\u2019s poems. I opened the volume\nand my glance fell upon the verse: \u2018_But the soul is already free,\nfloating on a sea of light_,\u2019 which were the concluding lines of the\npoem entitled \u2018The Pilgrim.\u2019 I read the poem and dimly recalled that\nI had known it many years ago. The scene of action is in Spain, and\nthis seemed to me to be the only relation between the quoted verse and\nthe place on the railroad journey described by me. I was only half\nsatisfied with my discovery and mechanically continued to turn the\npages of the book. On turning the next page I found a poem the title of\nwhich was \u2018_Bidassao Bridge_.\u2019\n\u201cI may add that the contents of this poem seemed even stranger to me\nthan that of the first, and that its first verse read:\n\u201c\u2018On the Bidassao bridge stands a saint grey with age, he blesses to\nthe right the Spanish mountain, to the left he blesses the French\nland.\u2019\u201d\nII. This understanding of the determination of apparently arbitrarily\nselected names, numbers, and words may perhaps contribute to the\nsolution of another problem. As is known, many persons argue against\nthe assumption of an absolute psychic determinism by referring to\nan intense feeling of conviction that there is a free will. This\nfeeling of conviction exists, but is not incompatible with the belief\nin determinism. Like all normal feelings, it must be justified by\nsomething. But, so far as I can observe, it does not manifest itself\nin weighty and important decisions; on these occasions one has much\nmore the feeling of a psychic compulsion and gladly falls back upon it.\n(Compare Luther\u2019s \u201cHere I stand, I cannot do anything else.\u201d)\nOn the other hand, it is in trivial and indifferent decisions that\none feels sure that he could just as easily have acted differently,\nthat he acted of his own free will, and without any motives. From\nour analyses we therefore need not contest the right of the feeling\nof conviction that there is a free will. If we distinguish conscious\nfrom unconscious motivation, we are then informed by the feeling of\nconviction that the conscious motivation does not extend over all our\nmotor resolutions. _Minima non curat pr\u00e6tor._ What is thus left free\nfrom the one side receives its motive from the other side, from the\nunconscious, and the determinism in the psychic realm is thus carried\nout uninterruptedly.[76]\nIII. Although conscious thought must be altogether ignorant of the\nmotivation of the faulty actions described above, yet it would be\ndesirable to discover a psychologic proof of its existence; indeed,\nreasons obtained through a deeper knowledge of the unconscious make it\nprobable that such proofs are to be discovered somewhere. As a matter\nof fact phenomena can be demonstrated in two spheres which seem to\ncorrespond to an unconscious and hence to a displaced knowledge of\nthese motives.\n(_a_)It is a striking and generally to be recognized feature in the\nbehaviour of paranoiacs, that they attach the greatest significance\nto the trivial details in the behaviour of others. Details which are\nusually overlooked by others they interpret and utilize as the basis\nof far-reaching conclusions. For example, the last paranoiac seen by\nme concluded that there was a general understanding among people of\nhis environment, because at his departure from the railway-station\nthey made a certain motion with one hand. Another noticed how people\nwalked on the street, how they brandished their walking-sticks, and the\nlike.[77]\nThe category of the accidental, requiring no motivation, which the\nnormal person lets pass as a part of his own psychic activities and\nfaulty actions, is thus rejected by the paranoiac in the application to\nthe psychic manifestations to others. All that he observes in others is\nfull of meaning, all is explainable. But how does he come to look at it\nin this manner? Probably here as in so many other cases, he projects\ninto the mental life of others what exists in his own unconscious\nactivity. Many things obtrude themselves on consciousness in paranoia\nwhich in normal and neurotic persons can only be demonstrated through\npsychoanalysis as existing in their unconscious.[78] In a certain sense\nthe paranoiac is here justified, he perceives something that escapes\nthe normal person, he sees clearer than one of normal intellectual\ncapacity, but his knowledge becomes worthless when he imputes to\nothers the state of affairs he thus recognizes. I hope that I shall\nnot be expected to justify every paranoic interpretation. But the\npoint which we grant to paranoia in this conception of chance actions\nwill facilitate for us the psychologic understanding of the conviction\nwhich the paranoiac attaches to all these interpretations. _There is\ncertainly some truth to it_; even our errors of judgment, which are\nnot designated as morbid, acquire their feeling of conviction in the\nsame way. This feeling is justified for a certain part of the erroneous\ntrain of thought or for the source of its origin, and we shall later\nextend to it the remaining relationships.\n(_b_) The phenomena of superstition furnish another indication of the\nunconscious motivation in chance and faulty actions. I will make myself\nclear through the discussion of a simple experience which gave me the\nstarting-point to these reflections.\nHaving returned from vacation, my thoughts immediately turned to the\npatients with whom I was to occupy myself in the beginning of my year\u2019s\nwork. My first visit was to a very old woman (see above) for whom I had\ntwice daily performed the same professional services for many years.\nOwing to this monotony unconscious thoughts have often found expression\non the way to the patient and during my occupation with her. She was\nover ninety years old; it was therefore pertinent to ask oneself at the\nbeginning of each year how much longer she was likely to live.\nOn the day of which I speak I was in a hurry and took a carriage to\nher house. Every coachman at the cabstand near my house knew the old\nwoman\u2019s address, as each of them had often driven me there. This day\nit happened that the driver did not stop in front of her house, but\nbefore one of the same number in a near-by and really similar-looking\nparallel street. I noticed the mistake and reproached the coachman, who\napologized for it.\nIs it of any significance when I am taken to a house where the\nold woman is not to be found? Certainly not to me; but were I\n_superstitious_, I should see an omen in this incident, a hint of fate\nthat this would be the last year for the old woman. A great many omens\nwhich have been preserved by history have been founded on no better\nsymbolism. Of course, I explain the incident as an accident without\nfurther meaning.\nThe case would have been entirely different had I come on foot and,\n\u201cabsorbed in thought\u201d or \u201cthrough distraction,\u201d I had gone to the house\nin the parallel street instead of the correct one. I would not explain\nthat as an accident, but as an action with unconscious intent requiring\ninterpretation. My explanation of this \u201clapse in walking\u201d would\nprobably be that I expected that the time would soon come when I should\nnot meet the old woman any longer.\nI therefore differ from a superstitious person in the following\nmanner:--\nI do not believe that an occurrence in which my mental life takes no\npart can teach me anything hidden concerning the future shaping of\nreality; but I do believe that an unintentional manifestation of my own\nmental activity surely contains something concealed which belongs only\nto my mental life--that is, I believe in outer (real) chance, but not\nin inner (psychic) accidents. With the superstitious person the case\nis reversed: he knows nothing of the motive of his chance and faulty\nactions, he believes in the existence of psychic contingencies; he\nis therefore inclined to attribute meaning to external chance, which\nmanifests itself in actual occurrence, and to see in the accident a\nmeans of expression for something hidden outside of him. There are two\ndifferences between me and the superstitious person: first, he projects\nthe motive to the outside, while I look for it in myself; second, he\nexplains the accident by an event which I trace to a thought. What\nhe considers hidden corresponds to the unconscious with me, and the\ncompulsion not to let chance pass as chance, but to explain it as\ncommon to both of us.\nThus I admit that this conscious ignorance and unconscious knowledge of\nthe motivation of psychic accidentalness is one of the psychic roots\nof superstition. _Because_ the superstitious person knows nothing of\nthe motivation of his own accidental actions, and because the fact of\nthis motivation strives for a place in his recognition, he is compelled\nto dispose of them by displacing them into the outer world. If such\na connection exists it can hardly be limited to this single case. As\na matter of fact, I believe that a large portion of the mythological\nconception of the world which reaches far into the most modern\nreligions _is nothing but psychology projected into the outer world_.\nThe dim perception (the endo-psychic perception, as it were) of psychic\nfactors and relations[79] of the unconscious was taken as a model in\nthe construction of a _transcendental reality_, which is destined to be\nchanged again by science into _psychology of the unconscious_.\nIt is difficult to express it in other terms; the analogy to paranoia\nmust here come to our aid. We venture to explain in this way the\nmyths of paradise and the fall of man, of God, of good and evil, of\nimmortality, and the like--that is, to transform _metaphysics_ into\n_meta-psychology_. The gap between the paranoiac\u2019s displacement\nand that of superstition is narrower than appears at first sight.\nWhen human beings began to think, they were obviously compelled to\nexplain the outer world in an anthropomorphic sense by a multitude of\npersonalities in their own image; the accidents which they explained\nsuperstitiously were thus actions and expressions of persons. In\nthat regard they behaved just like paranoiacs, who draw conclusions\nfrom insignificant signs which others give them, and like all\nnormal persons who justly take the unintentional actions of their\nfellow-beings as a basis for the estimation of their characters. Only\nin our modern philosophical, but by no means finished, views of life\ndoes superstition seem so much out of place: in the view of life of\npre-scientific times and nations it was justified and consistent.\nThe Roman who gave up an important undertaking because he sighted\nan ill-omened flock of birds was relatively right; his action was\nconsistent with his principles. But if he withdrew from an undertaking\nbecause he had stumbled on his threshold (_un Romain retournerait_),\nhe was absolutely superior even to us unbelievers. He was a better\npsychologist than we are striving to become. For his stumbling\ncould demonstrate to him the existence of a doubt, an internal\ncounter-current the force of which could weaken the power of his\nintention at the moment of its execution. For only by concentrating\nall psychic forces on the desired aim can one be assured of perfect\nsuccess. How does Schiller\u2019s Tell, who hesitated so long to shoot the\napple from his son\u2019s head, answer the bailiff\u2019s question why he had\nprovided himself with a second arrow?\n\u201c_With the second arrow I would have pierced you had I struck my dear\nchild--and truly, I should not have failed to reach you._\u201d\nIV. Whoever has had the opportunity of studying the concealed psychic\nfeelings of persons by means of psychoanalysis can also tell something\nnew concerning the quality of unconscious motives, which express\nthemselves in superstition. Nervous persons afflicted with compulsive\nthinking and compulsive states, who are often very intelligent, show\nvery plainly that superstition originates from repressed hostile\nand cruel impulses. The greater part of superstition signifies fear\nof impending evil, and he who has frequently wished evil to others,\nbut because of a good bringing-up has repressed the same into the\nunconscious, will be particularly apt to expect punishment for such\nunconscious evil in the form of a misfortune threatening him from\nwithout.\nIf we concede that we have by no means exhausted the psychology of\nsuperstition in these remarks, we must, on the other hand, at least\ntouch upon the question whether real roots of superstition should\nbe altogether denied, whether there are really no omens, prophetic\ndreams, telepathic experiences, manifestations of supernatural forces,\nand the like. I am now far from willing to repudiate without anything\nfurther all these phenomena, concerning which we possess so many minute\nobservations even from men of intellectual prominence, and which\nshould certainly form a basis for further investigation. We may even\nhope that some of these observations will be explained by our present\nknowledge of the unconscious psychic processes without necessitating\nradical changes in our present aspect. If still other phenomena, as,\nfor example, those maintained by the spiritualists, should be proven,\nwe should then consider the modification of our \u201claws\u201d as demanded by\nthe new experience, without becoming confused in regard to the relation\nof things of this world.\nIn the sphere of these analyses I can only answer the questions\nhere proposed subjectively--that is, in accordance with my personal\nexperience. I am sorry to confess that I belong to that class of\nunworthy individuals before whom the spirits cease their activities\nand the supernatural disappears, so that I have never been in\nposition to experience anything personally that would stimulate\nbelief in the miraculous. Like everybody else, I have had forebodings\nand experienced misfortunes; but the two evaded each other, so\nthat nothing followed the foreboding, and the misfortune struck me\nunannounced. When as a young man I lived alone in a strange city I\nfrequently heard my name suddenly pronounced by an unmistakable, dear\nvoice, and I then made a note of the exact moment of the hallucination\nin order to inquire carefully of those at home what had occurred at\nthat time. There was nothing to it. On the other hand, I later worked\namong my patients calmly and without foreboding while my child almost\nbled to death. Nor have I ever been able to recognize as unreal\nphenomena any of the forebodings reported to me by my patients.\nThe belief in prophetic dreams numbers many adherents, because it can\nbe supported by the fact that some things really so happen in the\nfuture as they were previously foretold by the wish of the dream.\nBut in this there is little to be wondered at, as many far-reaching\ndeviations may be regularly demonstrated between a dream and the\nfulfilment which the credulity of the dreamer prefers to neglect.\nA nice example, one which may be justly called prophetic, was\nonce brought to me for exhaustive analysis by an intelligent and\ntruth-loving patient. She related that she once dreamed that she had\nmet a former friend and family physician in front of a certain store\nin a certain street, and next morning when she went down town she\nactually met him at the place named in the dream. I may observe that\nthe significance of this wonderful coincidence was not proven to be due\nto any subsequent event--that is, it could not be justified through\nfuture occurrences.\nCareful examination definitely established the fact that there was no\nproof that the woman recalled the dream in the morning following the\nnight of the dream--that is, before the walk and before the meeting.\nShe could offer no objection when this state of affairs was presented\nin a manner that robbed this episode of everything miraculous, leaving\nonly an interesting psychologic problem. One morning she had walked\nthrough this very street, had met her old family physician before that\ncertain store, and on seeing him received the conviction that during\nthe preceding night she had dreamed of this meeting at this place.\nThe analysis then showed with great probability how she came to\nthis conviction, to which, in accordance with the general rule, we\ncannot deny a certain right to credence. A meeting at a definite\nplace following a previous expectation really describes the fact of a\nrendezvous. The old family physician awakened her memory of old times,\nwhen meetings with a third person, also a friend of the physician, were\nof marked significance to her. Since that time she had continued her\nrelations with this gentleman, and the day before the mentioned dream\nshe had waited for him in vain. If I could report in greater detail the\ncircumstances here before us, I could easily show that the illusion\nof the prophetic dream at the sight of the friend of former times is\nperchance equivalent to the following speech: \u201cAh, doctor, you now\nremind me of bygone times, when I never had to wait in vain for N. when\nwe had arranged a meeting.\u201d\nI have observed in myself a simple and easily explained example, which\nis probably a good model for similar occurrences of those familiar\n\u201cremarkable coincidences\u201d wherein we meet a person of whom we were\njust thinking. During a walk through the inner city a few days after\nthe title of \u201cProfessor\u201d was bestowed on me, which carries with it a\ngreat deal of prestige even in monarchical cities, my thoughts suddenly\nmerged into a childish revenge-fantasy against a certain married\ncouple. Some months previous they had called me to see their little\ndaughter who suffered from an interesting compulsive manifestation\nfollowing the appearance of a dream. I took a great interest in the\ncase, the genesis of which I believed I could surmise, but the parents\nwere unfavourable to my treatment, and gave me to understand that\nthey thought of applying to a foreign authority who cured by means\nof hypnotism. I now fancied that after the failure of this attempt,\nthe parents begged me to resume my treatment, that they now had full\nconfidence in me, etc. But I answered: \u201cNow that I have become a\nprofessor, you have confidence in me. The title has made no change in\nmy ability; if you could not use me when I was instructor you can get\nalong without me now that I am a professor.\u201d At this point my fantasy\nwas interrupted by a loud \u201cGood evening, Professor!\u201d and as I looked up\nthere passed me the same couple on whom I had just taken this imaginary\nvengeance.\nThe next reflection destroyed the semblance of the miraculous. I was\nwalking towards this couple on a straight, almost deserted street;\nglancing up hastily at a distance of perhaps twenty steps from me,\nI had spied and realized their stately personalities; but this\nperception, following the model of a negative hallucination, was set\naside by certain emotionally accentuated motives and then asserted\nitself in the apparently spontaneous emerging fantasy.\nA similar experience is related by Brill, which also throws some light\non the nature of telepathy.\n\u201cWhile engrossed in conversation during our customary Sunday evening\ndinner at one of the large New York restaurants, I suddenly stopped\nand irrelevantly remarked to my wife, \u2018I wonder how Dr. R. is doing\nin Pittsburg.\u2019 She looked at me much astonished and said: \u2018Why, that\nis exactly what I have been thinking for the last few seconds! Either\nyou have transferred this thought to me or I have transferred it to\nyou. How can you otherwise explain this strange phenomenon?\u2019 I had\nto admit that I could offer no solution. Our conversation throughout\nthe dinner showed not the remotest association to Dr. R., nor, so far\nas our memories went, had we heard or spoken of him for some time.\nBeing a sceptic, I refused to admit that there was anything mysterious\nabout it, although inwardly I felt quite uncertain. To be frank, I was\nsomewhat mystified.\n\u201cBut we did not remain very long in this state of mind, for on looking\ntoward the cloak-room we were surprised to see Dr. R. Though closer\ninspection showed our mistake, we were both struck by the remarkable\nresemblance of this stranger to Dr. R. From the position of the\ncloak-room we were forced to conclude that this stranger had passed\nour table. Absorbed in our conversation, we had not noticed him\nconsciously, but the visual image had stirred up the association of his\ndouble, Dr. R. That we should both have experienced the same thought\nis also quite natural. The last word from our friend was to the effect\nthat he had taken up private practice in Pittsburg, and, being aware\nof the vicissitudes that beset the beginner, it was quite natural to\nwonder how fortune smiled upon him.\n\u201cWhat promised to be a supernatural manifestation was thus easily\nexplained on a normal basis; but had we not noticed the stranger before\nhe left the restaurant, it would have been impossible to exclude the\nmysterious. I venture to say that such simple mechanisms are at the\nbottom of the most complicated telepathic manifestations; at least,\nsuch has been my experience in all cases accessible to investigation.\u201d\nAnother \u201csolution of an apparent foreboding\u201d was reported by Otto\nRank[80]:--\n\u201cSome time ago I had experienced a remarkable variation of that\n\u2018peculiar coincidence\u2019 wherein one meets a person who has just been\noccupying one\u2019s thoughts. Shortly before Christmas I went to the\nAustro-Hungarian Bank in order to obtain ten new silver crown-pieces\ndestined for Christmas gifts. Absorbed in ambitious fantasies which\ndealt with the contrast of my meagre means to the enormous sums in the\nbanking-house, I turned into the narrow street to the bank. In front\nof the door I saw an automobile and many people going in and out. I\nthought to myself: \u2018The officials will have plenty of time for my new\ncrowns; naturally I shall be quick about it; I shall put down the paper\nnotes to be exchanged, and say, \u201cPlease give me gold.\u201d\u2019 I realized my\nmistake at once--I was to have asked for _silver_--and awoke from my\nfantasies.\n\u201cI was now only a few steps from the entrance, and noticed a young man\ncoming toward me who looked familiar, but whom I could not definitely\nidentify on account of my short-sightedness. As he came nearer I\nrecognized him as a classmate of my brother whose name was _Gold_ and\nfrom whose brother, a well-known journalist, I had great expectations\nin the beginning of my literary career. But these expectations had not\nmaterialized, and with them had vanished the hoped-for material success\nwith which my fantasies were occupying themselves on my way to the\nbank. Thus engrossed I must have unconsciously perceived the approach\nof Mr. Gold, who impressed himself on my conscience while I was\ndreaming of material success, and thereby caused me to ask the cashier\nfor gold instead of the inferior silver. But, on the other hand, the\nparadoxical fact that my unconscious was able to perceive an object\nlong before it was recognized by the eye might in part be explained by\nthe complex readiness (_Komplexbereitschaft_) of Bleuler. For my mind\nwas attuned to the material, and, contrary to my better knowledge, it\nguided my steps from the very beginning to buildings where gold and\npaper money were exchanged.\u201d\nTo the category of the wonderful and uncanny we may also add that\nstrange feeling we perceive in certain moments and situations when it\nseems as if we had already had exactly the same experience, or had\npreviously found ourselves in the same situation. Yet we are never\nsuccessful in our efforts to recall clearly those former experiences\nand situations. I know that I follow only the loose colloquial\nexpression when I designate that which stimulates us in such moments as\na \u201cfeeling.\u201d We undoubtedly deal with a judgment, and, indeed, with a\njudgment of cognition; but these cases, nevertheless, have a character\npeculiar to themselves, and besides, we must not ignore the fact that\nwe never recall what we are seeking.\nI do not know whether this phenomenon of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ was ever seriously\noffered as a proof of a former psychic existence of the individual; but\nit is certain that psychologists have taken an interest in it, and have\nattempted to solve the riddle in a multitude of speculative ways. None\nof the proposed tentative explanations seems right to me, because none\ntakes account of anything but the accompanying manifestations and the\nfavouring conditions of the phenomenon. Those psychic processes which,\naccording to my observation, are alone responsible for the explanation\nof the _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_--namely, the unconscious fantasies--are generally\nneglected by the psychologists even to-day.\nI believe that it is wrong to designate the feeling of having\nexperienced something before as an illusion. On the contrary, in such\nmoments something is really touched that we have already experienced,\nonly we cannot consciously recall the latter because it never was\nconscious. In short, the feeling of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ corresponds to the memory\nof an unconscious fantasy. There are unconscious fantasies (or day\ndreams) just as there are similar conscious creations, which every one\nknows from personal experience.\nI realize that the object is worthy of most minute study, but I will\nhere give the analysis of only one case of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ in which the\nfeeling was characterized by particular intensity and persistence.\nA woman of thirty-seven years asserted that she most distinctly\nremembered that at the age of twelve and a half she paid her first\nvisit to some school friends in the country, and as she entered the\ngarden she immediately had the feeling of having been there before.\nThis feeling was repeated as she went through the living-rooms, so that\nshe believed she knew beforehand how big the next room was, what views\none could have on looking out of it, etc. But the belief that this\nfeeling of recognition might have its source in a previous visit to\nthe house and garden, perhaps a visit paid in earliest childhood, was\nabsolutely excluded and disproved by statements from her parents. The\nwoman who related this sought no psychologic explanation, but saw in\nthe appearance of this feeling a prophetic reference to the importance\nwhich these friends later assumed in her emotional life. On taking into\nconsideration, however, the circumstance under which this phenomenon\npresented itself to her, we found the way to another conception.\nWhen she decided upon this visit she knew that these girls had an only\nbrother, who was seriously ill. In the course of the visit she actually\nsaw him. She found him looking very badly, and thought to herself that\nhe would soon die. But it happened that her own only brother had had a\nserious attack of diphtheria some months before, and during his illness\nshe had lived for weeks with relatives far from her parental home. She\nbelieved that her brother was taking part in this visit to the country,\nimagined even that this was his first long journey since his illness;\nstill, her memory was remarkably indistinct in regard to these points,\nwhereas all other details, and particularly the dress which she wore\nthat day, remained most clearly before her eyes.\nTo the initiated it will not be difficult to conclude from these\nsuggestions that the expectation of her brother\u2019s death had played a\ngreat part in the girl\u2019s mind at that time, and that either it never\nbecame conscious or it was more energetically repressed after the\nfavourable issue of the illness. Under other circumstances she would\nhave been compelled to wear another dress--namely, mourning clothes.\nShe found the analogous situation in her friends\u2019 home; their only\nbrother was in danger of an early death, an event that really came\nto pass a short time after. She might have consciously remembered\nthat she had lived through a similar situation a few months previous,\nbut instead of recalling what was inhibited through repression she\ntransferred the memory feeling to the locality, to the garden, and the\nhouse, and merged it into the _fausse reconnaissance_ that she had\nalready seen everything exactly as it was.\nFrom the fact of the repression we may conclude that the former\nexpectation of the death of her brother was not far from evincing the\ncharacter of a wish-fantasy. She would then have become the only child.\nIn her later neurosis she suffered in the most intense manner from the\nfear of losing her parents, behind which the analysis disclosed, as\nusual, the unconscious wish of the same content.\nMy own experience of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ I can trace in a similar manner to the\nemotional constellation of the moment. It may be expressed as follows:\n\u201cThat would be another occasion for awakening certain fantasies\n(unconscious and unknown) which were formed in me at one time or\nanother as a wish to improve my situation.\u201d[81]\nV. Recently when I had occasion to recite to a colleague of a\nphilosophical turn of mind some examples of name-forgetting, with their\nanalyses, he hastened to reply: \u201cThat is all very well, but with me the\nforgetting of a name proceeds in a different manner.\u201d Evidently one\ncannot dismiss this question as simply as that; I do not believe that\nmy colleague had ever thought of an analysis for the forgetting of a\nname, nor could he say how the process differed in him. But his remark,\nnevertheless, touches upon a problem which many would be inclined to\nplace in the foreground. Does the solution given for faulty and chance\nactions apply in general or only in particular cases, and if only in\nthe latter, what are the conditions under which it may also be employed\nin the explanation of the other phenomena?\nIn answer to this question my experiences leave me in the lurch. I can\nonly urge against considering the demonstrated connections as rare, for\nas often as I have made the test in myself and with my patients it was\nalways definitely demonstrated exactly as in the examples reported,\nor there were at least good reasons to assume this. One should not be\nsurprised, however, when one does not succeed every time in finding the\nconcealed meaning of the symptomatic action, as the amount of inner\nresistances ranging themselves against the solution must be considered\na deciding factor. Also it is not always possible to explain every\nindividual dream of one\u2019s self or of patients. To substantiate the\ngeneral validity of the theory, it is enough if one can penetrate only\na certain distance into the hidden associations. The dream which proves\nrefractory when the solution is attempted on the following day can\noften be robbed of its secret a week or a month later, when the psychic\nfactors combating one another have been reduced as a consequence of a\nreal change that has meanwhile taken place. The same applies to the\nsolution of faulty and symptomatic actions. It would therefore be wrong\nto affirm of all cases which resist analysis that they are caused by\nanother psychic mechanism than that here revealed; such assumption\nrequires more than negative proofs; moreover, the readiness to believe\nin a different explanation of faulty and symptomatic actions, which\nprobably exists universally in all normal persons, does not prove\nanything; it is obviously an expression of the same psychic forces\nwhich produced the secret, which therefore strives to protect and\nstruggle against its elucidation.\nOn the other hand, we must not overlook the fact that the repressed\nthoughts and feelings are not independent in attaining expression in\nsymptomatic and faulty actions. The technical possibility for such\nan adjustment of the innervations must be furnished independently\nof them, and this is then gladly utilized by the intention of the\nrepressed material to come to conscious expression. In the case of\nlinguistic faulty actions an attempt has been made by philosophers and\nphilologists to verify through minute observations what structural and\nfunctional relations enter into the service of such intention. If in\nthe determinations of faulty and symptomatic actions we separate the\nunconscious motive from its co-active physiological and psychophysical\nrelations, the question remains open whether there are still other\nfactors within normal limits which, like the unconscious motive, and in\nits place can produce faulty and symptomatic actions on the road of the\nrelations. It is not my task to answer this question.\nVI. Since the discussion of speech blunders we have been content to\ndemonstrate that faulty actions have a concealed motive, and through\nthe aid of psychoanalysis we have traced our way to the knowledge of\ntheir motivation. The general nature and the peculiarities of the\npsychic factors brought to expression in these faulty actions we have\nhitherto left almost without consideration; at any rate, we have not\nattempted to define them more accurately or to examine into their\nlawfulness. Nor will we now attempt a thorough elucidation of the\nsubject, as the first steps have already taught us that it is more\nfeasible to enter this structure from another side. Here we can put\nbefore ourselves certain questions which I will cite in their order.\n(1) What is the content and the origin of the thoughts and feelings\nwhich show themselves through faulty and chance actions? (2) What are\nthe conditions which force a thought or a feeling to make use of these\noccurrences as a means of expression and place it in a position to do\nso? (3) Can constant and definite associations be demonstrated between\nthe manner of the faulty action and the qualities brought to expression\nthrough it?\nI shall begin by bringing together some material for answering the last\nquestion. In the discussion of the examples of speech blunders we found\nit necessary to go beyond the contents of the intended speech, and we\nhad to seek the cause of the speech disturbance outside the intention.\nThe latter was quite clear in a series of cases, and was known to the\nconsciousness of the speaker. In the example that seemed most simple\nand transparent it was a similar sounding but different conception of\nthe same thought, which disturbed its expression without any one being\nable to say why the one succumbed and the other came to the surface\n(Meringer and Mayers\u2019 _Contaminations_).\nIn a second group of cases one conception succumbed to a motive which\ndid not, however, prove strong enough to cause complete submersion. The\nconception which was withheld was clearly presented to consciousness.\nOnly of the third group can we affirm unreservedly that the disturbing\nthought differed from the one intended, and it is obvious that it\nmay establish an essential distinction. The disturbing thought is\neither connected with the disturbed one through a thought association\n(disturbance through inner contradiction), or it is substantially\nstrange to it, and just the disturbed word is connected with the\ndisturbing thought through a surprising outer association, which is\nfrequently unconscious.\nIn the examples which I have given from my psychoanalyses it is found\nthat the entire speech is either under the influence of thoughts which\nhave become active simultaneously, or under absolutely unconscious\nthoughts which betray themselves either through the disturbance itself,\nor which evince an indirect influence by making it possible for the\nindividual parts of the unconsciously intended speech to disturb\none another. The retained or unconscious thoughts from which the\ndisturbances in speech emanate are of most varied origin. A general\nsurvey does not reveal any definite direction.\nComparative examinations of examples of mistakes in reading and writing\nlead to the same conclusions. Isolated cases, as in speech blunders,\nseem to owe their origin to an unmotivated work of condensation\n(_e.g._, the _Apel_). But we should be pleased to know whether special\nconditions must not be fulfilled in order that such condensation,\nwhich is considered regular in the dream-work and faulty in our waking\nthoughts, should take place. No information concerning this can be\nobtained from the examples themselves. But I merely refuse from this\nto draw the conclusion that there are no such conditions, as, for\ninstance, the relaxation of conscious attention; for I have learned\nelsewhere that automatic actions are especially characterized by\ncorrectness and reliability. I would rather emphasize the fact that\nhere, as so frequently in biology, it is the normal relations, or\nthose approaching the normal, that are less favourable objects for\ninvestigation than the pathological. What remains obscure in the\nexplanation of these most simple disturbances will, according to my\nexpectation, be made clear through the explanation of more serious\ndisturbances.\nAlso mistakes in reading and writing do not lack examples in which more\nremote and more complicated motivation can be recognized.\nThere is no doubt that the disturbances of the speech functions occur\nmore easily and make less demand on the disturbing forces than other\npsychic acts.\nBut one is on different ground when it comes to the examination of\nforgetting in the literal sense--_i.e._, the forgetting of past\nexperiences. (To distinguish this forgetting from the others we\ndesignate _sensu strictiori_ the forgetting of proper names and\nforeign words, as in Chapters I and II, as \u201cslips\u201d; and the forgetting\nof resolutions as \u201comissions.\u201d) The principal conditions of the\nnormal process in forgetting are unknown.[82] We are also reminded\nof the fact that not all is forgotten which we believe to be. Our\nexplanation here deals only with those cases in which the forgetting\narouses our astonishment, in so far as it infringes the rule that\nthe unimportant is forgotten, while the important matter is guarded\nby memory. Analysis of these examples of forgetting which seem to\ndemand a special explanation shows that the motive of forgetting is\nalways an unwillingness to recall something which may evoke painful\nfeelings. We come to the conjecture that this motive universally\nstrives for expression in psychic life, but is inhibited through other\nand contrary forces from regularly manifesting itself. The extent and\nsignificance of this dislike to recall painful impressions seems worthy\nof the most painstaking psychologic investigation. The question as\nto what special conditions render possible the universally resistant\nforgetting in individual cases cannot be solved through this added\nassociation.\nA different factor steps into the foreground in the forgetting of\nresolutions; the supposed conflict resulting in the repression of the\npainful memory becomes tangible, and in the analysis of the examples\none regularly recognizes a counter-will which opposes but does not put\nan end to the resolution. As in previously discussed faulty acts, we\nhere also recognize two types of the psychic process: the counter-will\neither turns directly against the resolution (in intentions of some\nconsequence) or it is substantially foreign to the resolution itself\nand establishes its connection with it through an outer association (in\nalmost indifferent resolutions).\nThe same conflict governs the phenomena of erroneously carried-out\nactions. The impulse which manifests itself in the disturbances of the\naction is frequently a counter-impulse. Still oftener it is altogether\na strange impulse which only utilizes the opportunity to express itself\nthrough a disturbance in the execution of the action. The cases in\nwhich the disturbance is the result of an inner contradiction are the\nmost significant ones, and also deal with the more important activities.\nThe inner conflict in the chance or symptomatic actions then merges\ninto the background. Those motor expressions which are least thought\nof, or are entirely overlooked by consciousness, serve as the\nexpression of numerous unconscious or restrained feelings. For the most\npart they represent symbolically wishes and phantoms.\nThe first question (as to the origin of the thoughts and emotions\nwhich find expression in faulty actions) we can answer by saying\nthat in a series of cases the origin of the disturbing thoughts can\nbe readily traced to repressed emotions of the psychic life. Even in\nhealthy persons egotistic, jealous and hostile feelings and impulses,\nburdened by the pressure of moral education, often utilize the path of\nfaulty actions to express in some way their undeniably existing force\nwhich is not recognized by the higher psychic instances. Allowing\nthese faulty and chance actions to continue corresponds in great\npart to a comfortable toleration of the unmoral. The manifold sexual\ncurrents play no insignificant part in these repressed feelings. That\nthey appear so seldom in the thoughts revealed by the analyses of\nmy examples is simply a matter of coincidence. As I have undertaken\nthe analyses of numerous examples from my own psychic life, the\nselection was partial from the first, and aimed at the exclusion of\nsexual matters. At other times it seemed that the disturbing thoughts\noriginated from the most harmless objection and consideration.\nWe have now reached the answer to the second question--that is, what\npsychologic conditions are responsible for the fact that a thought\nmust seek expression, not in its complete form but, as it were, in\nparasitic form, as a modification and disturbance of another. From\nthe most striking examples of faulty actions it is quite obvious that\nthis determinant should be sought in a relation to conscious capacity,\nor in the more or less firmly pronounced character of the \u201crepressed\u201d\nmaterial. But an examination of this series of examples shows that\nthis character consists of many indistinct elements. The tendency to\noverlook something because it is wearisome, or because the concerned\nthought does not really belong to the intended matter--these feelings\nseem to play the same r\u00f4le as motives for the suppression of a thought\n(which later depends for expression on the disturbance of another), as\nthe moral condemnation of a rebellious emotional feeling, or as the\norigin of absolutely unconscious trains of thought. An insight into the\ngeneral nature of the condition of faulty and chance actions cannot be\ngained in this way.\nHowever, this investigation gives us one single significant fact; the\nmore harmless the motivation of the faulty act the less obnoxious,\nand hence the less incapable of consciousness, the thought to which\nit gives expression is; the easier also becomes the solution of the\nphenomenon after we have turned our attention toward it. The simplest\ncases of speech blunders are immediately noticed and spontaneously\ncorrected. Where one deals with motivation through actually repressed\nfeelings the solution requires a painstaking analysis, which may\nsometimes strike against difficulties or turn out unsuccessful.\nOne is therefore justified in taking the result of this last\ninvestigation as an indication of the fact that the satisfactory\nexplanation of the psychologic determinations of faulty and chance\nactions is to be acquired in another way and from another source.\nThe indulgent reader can therefore see in these discussions the\ndemonstration of the surfaces of fracture in which this theme was quite\nartificially evolved from a broader connection.\nVII. Just a few words to indicate the direction of this broader\nconnection. The mechanism of the faulty and chance actions, as we\nhave learned to know it through the application of analysis, shows in\nthe most essential points an agreement with the mechanism of dream\nformation, which I have discussed in the chapter \u201cThe Dream Work\u201d of\nmy book on the interpretation of dreams. Here, as there, one finds\nthe condensation and compromise formation (\u201ccontaminations\u201d); in\naddition the situation is much the same, since unconscious thoughts\nfind expression as modifications of other thoughts in unusual ways\nand through outer associations. The incongruities, absurdities, and\nerrors in the dream content by virtue of which the dream is scarcely\nrecognized as a psychic achievement originate in the same way--to be\nsure, through freer usage of the existing material--as the common error\nof our everyday life; _here, as there, the appearance of the incorrect\nfunction is explained through the peculiar interference of two or more\ncorrect actions_.\nAn important conclusion can be drawn from, this combination: the\npeculiar mode of operation, whose most striking function we recognize\nin the dream content, should not be adjudged only to the sleeping state\nof the psychic life when we possess abundant proof of its activity\nduring the waking state in the form of faulty actions. The same\nconnection also forbids us assuming that these psychic processes which\nimpress us as abnormal and strange are determined by deep-seated decay\nof psychic activity or by morbid state of function.[83]\nThe correct understanding of this strange psychic work which allows\nthe faulty actions to originate like the dream pictures will only be\npossible after we have discovered that the psychoneurotic symptoms,\nparticularly the psychic formations of hysteria and compulsion\nneurosis, repeat in their mechanisms all the essential features of\nthis mode of operation. The continuation of our investigation would\ntherefore have to begin at this point.\nThere is still another special interest for us in considering the\nfaulty, chance, and symptomatic actions in the light of this last\nanalogy. If we compare them to the function of the psychoneuroses and\nthe neurotic symptoms, two frequently recurring statements gain in\nsense and support--namely, that the border-line between the nervous,\nnormal, and abnormal states is indistinct, and that we are all slightly\nnervous. Regardless of all medical experience, one may construe various\ntypes of such barely suggested nervousness, the _formes frustes_ of the\nneuroses. There may be cases in which only a few symptoms appear, or\nthey may manifest themselves rarely or in mild forms; the extenuation\nmay be transferred to the number, intensity, or to the temporal\noutbreak of the morbid manifestation. It may also happen that just\nthis type, which forms the most frequent transition between health and\ndisease, may never be discovered. The transition type, whose morbid\nmanifestations come in the form of faulty and symptomatic actions, is\ncharacterized by the fact that the symptoms are transformed to the\nleast important psychic activities, while everything that can lay claim\nto a higher psychic value remains free from disturbance. When the\nsymptoms are disposed of in a reverse manner--that is, when they appear\nin the most important individual and social activities in a manner to\ndisturb the functions of nourishment and sexual relations, professional\nand social life--such disposition is found in the severe cases of\nneuroses, and is perhaps more characteristic of the latter than the\nmultiformity or vividness of the morbid manifestations.\nBut the common character of the mildest as well as the severest cases,\nto which the faulty and chance actions contribute, lies _in the ability\nto refer the phenomena to unwelcome, repressed, psychic material,\nwhich, though pushed away from consciousness, is nevertheless not\nrobbed of all capacity to express itself_.\nINDEX\nActions--\nAccidental, 192\nChance, 215\nSymbolic, 210\nSymptomatic, 178, 215, 235\nCollection of, 238\nExamples, 216, 217\nGrouping of, 219\nAdler, 283, 287\nAmnesia, 139\nInfantile, 62\nTemporary, 35\nAnalysis of--\nAliquis, 18\nCastelvetrano, 50\nOde to Apollo, 29\nSignorelli, 4\nYoung, 44\nAnticipations, 72\nAssociation, 11\nAuditifs, 63\nAwkwardness, accidental, 209\nBed-wetting, 150\nBehaviour of paranoiacs, 304\nBernheim, 161\nBleuler, 38, 120, 303, 319\nBlood miracle, 20\nBlunders, speech, 74\nBoileau, quoted from, 114\nBrant\u00f4me, 93\nBreaking of objects, 184, 186, 187, 189\nBrill, 19, 29, 32, 101, 102, 103, 130, 147, 169, 170, 197, 241, 249,\n258, 293, 316\nChance, 277\nChance numbers, 282, 283\nCharcot, 63, 157\nChild, intellectual accomplishments of, 62\nChildhood activities, trace of, 62\nCombined faulty acts, 265\nExamples of, 266, 267\nComplex--\nAmbition, 100\nFamily, 40\n\u0152dipus, 198\nPersonal, 38, 49\nProfessional, 40\nSelf-reference, 52\nCompromise formation, examples of, 81\nConsciousness, 10\nBringing hidden ideas to, 19\nContaminations, 72\nContradiction from repression, 26\nCounter-will, 170\nIn resolutions, 170\nDamaging things, 190, 191\nDarwin, 154\nDattner, B., 129, 232, 233, 239\nDaudet, 156\nDeath and sexuality, 7\n_D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_--\nExplanation of, 321\nPhenomenon of, 320\nDelusions, formation of, 155\nDenials, 149\nDeterminant, inner, 13\nDeterminism, 277\nIn mental life, 278\nPsychic, 302\nDisplacement, 4, 10, 57\nRetro-active, 58\nDisturbance of newly emerging theme, 6\nDon Quixote, 202\nDream, prophetic, 312\nElement, suppressed, 11\nErroneously carried-out actions, 177, 278, 332\nAs an expression of self-reproach, 184\nExamples of, 178, 179, 180\nErrors, 249\nExamples of, 250, 251, 253\nOf memory, 249\nMechanism of, 256\nExamples arbitrarily chosen, 279, 281\nFall, 191\nFalse recollection, 4\nFaulty acts, 192\nActions, 326\nFaulty actions--\nExplanation of, 322\nIn relation to nervousness, 337\nThe psychoneurotic symptom, 337\nMemory, mechanism of, 10\nRelation to the dream, 335\nFerenczi, 33, 43, 46, 98, 204, 324\nFolk-lore, 154\nForebodings, 312\nFore-sounds, influence of, 78\nForget, disposition to, 11\nTendency to, 17\nForgetfulness, 168\nDue to disturbances of pain, 27\nExcusing power of, 165\nPsychic mechanism of, 3\nTemporary, of proper names, 3, 29, 45\nForgetting--\nAs a spontaneous process, 135\nDefensive tendency of, 153\nExamples of, 139, 140, 141, 148, 149\nIntentional, 8\nMechanism of, 52, 330\nOf experiences, 138\nOf foreign words, 17\nOf impressions, 135, 138\nOf intentions, 159\nOf knowledge, 139\nOf names, 29, 39, 40, 155, 324\nOf resolutions, 135, 173, 332\nPain motive of, 155\nPreference for proper names, 3, 4, 11\nPsychologic analysis of, 136\nPurposive, 24\nThe order of words, 29, 33, 34\nThrough neglect, 163\nFree will, 303\nFreud, 43, 300\nGross, Hans, 154, 304\nHallucination, 313\nHenri V. and C., 61\nHitschman, 301\nIdentification, 100\nImpotence, psychic, 34\nInjury, self-inflicted, 199, 201\nIntention, 159\nIntentions--\nForgetting of, 160\nSecondary, 163\nInterchangings, 72\nJones, E., 31, 51, 97, 109, 127, 129, 148, 151, 155, 163, 179, 221,\n239, 267, 290, 292\nJung, C.

Here, too, the forgetting seems to be\naccompanied by substitutive formations. When I later asked my companion\nwhether in his effort to recall the forgotten word he did not think of\nsome substitution, he informed me that he was at first tempted to put\nan ab into the verse: _nostris ab ossibus_ (perhaps the disjointed part\nof _a-liquis_) and that later the word _exoriare_ obtruded itself with\nparticular distinctness and persistency. Being sceptical, he added that\nit was apparently due to the fact that it was the first word of the\nverse. But when I asked him to focus his attention on the associations\nto _exoriare_ he gave me the word _exorcism_. This makes me think that\nthe reinforcement of _exoriare_ in the reproduction has really the\nvalue of such substitution. It probably came through the association\n_exorcism_ from the names of the saints. However, those are refinements\nupon which no value need be laid. It seems now quite possible that\nthe appearance of any kind of substitutive recollection is a constant\nsign--perhaps only characteristic and misleading--of the purposive\nforgetting motivated by repression. This substitution might also exist\nin the reinforcement of an element akin to the thing forgotten, even\nwhere incorrect substitutive names fail to appear. Thus, in the example\nSignorelli, as long as the name of the painter remained inaccessible\nto me, I had more than a clear visual memory of the cycle of his\nfrescoes, and of the picture of himself in the corner; at least it was\nmore intensive than any of my other visual memory traces. In another\ncase, also reported in my essay of 1898, I had hopelessly forgotten\nthe street name and address connected with a disagreeable visit in\na strange city, but--as if to mock me--the house number appeared\nespecially vivid, whereas the memory of numbers usually causes me the\ngreatest difficulty.]\n[Footnote 4: I am not fully convinced of the lack of an inner\nconnection between the two streams of thought in the case of\n_Signorelli_. In carefully following the repressed thought concerning\nthe theme of death and sexual life, one does strike an idea which shows\na near relation to the theme of the frescoes of _Orvieto_.]\n[Footnote 5: _The Psychology of Dementia Pr\u00e6cox_, translated by F.\nPeterson and A.

I shall cite here\nsome excellent observations concerning the forgetting of names from the\nworks of Professor E. Jones, of Toronto: _Papers on Psycho-analysis_,\nchap. iii. p. 49:--\n\u201cFew people can avoid feeling a twinge of resentment when they find\nthat their name has been forgotten, particularly if it is by some one\nwith whom they had hoped or expected it would be remembered. They\ninstinctively realize that if they had made a greater impression on the\nperson\u2019s mind he would certainly have remembered them again, for the\nname is an integral part of the personality. Similarly, few things are\nmore flattering to most people than to find themselves addressed by\nname by a great personage where they could hardly have anticipated it.\nNapoleon, like most leaders of men, was a master of this art. In the\nmidst of the disastrous campaign of France in 1814, he gave an amazing\nproof of his memory in this direction. When in a town near Craonne, he\nrecollected that he had met the mayor, De Bussy, over twenty years ago\nin the La F\u00e8re Regiment. The delighted De Bussy at once threw himself\ninto his service with extraordinary zeal. Conversely, there is no surer\nway of affronting some one than by pretending to forget his name; the\ninsinuation is thus conveyed that the person is so unimportant in our\neyes that we cannot be bothered to remember his name. This device is\noften exploited in literature. In Turgentev\u2019s _Smoke_ (p. 255) the\nfollowing passage occurs: \u201c\u2018So you still find Baden entertaining,\nM\u2019sieur--Litvinov.\u2019 Ratmirov always uttered Litvinov\u2019s surname with\nhesitation, every time, as though he had forgotten it, and could not at\nonce recall it. In this way, as well as by the lofty flourish of his\nhat in saluting him, he meant to insult his pride.\u201d The same author,\nin his _Fathers and Children_ (p. 107), writes: \u201cThe Governor invited\nKirsanov and Bazarov to his ball, and within a few minutes invited them\na second time, regarding them as brothers, and calling them Kisarov.\u201d\nHere the forgetting that he had spoken to them, the mistake in the\nnames, and the inability to distinguish between the two young men,\nconstitute a culmination of disparagement. Falsification of a name has\nthe same signification as forgetting it; it is only a step towards\ncomplete amnesia.\u201d]\n[Footnote 21: _Zentralb. f. Psychoanalyse_, ii., Jahrg. I.

In\nthe anamneses which parents give about their neurotic daughters, it is\nhardly possible to distinguish with any degree of certainty the portion\nforgotten from that hidden, for anything that stands in the way of the\ngirl\u2019s future marriage is systematically set aside by the parents,\nthat is, it becomes repressed. A man who had recently lost his beloved\nwife from an affection of the lungs reported to me the following case\nof misleading the doctor, which can only be explained by the theory\nof such forgetting. \u201cAs my poor wife\u2019s pleuritis had not disappeared\nafter many weeks, Dr. P. was called in consultation. While taking the\nhistory he asked among others the customary questions whether there\nwere any cases of lung trouble in my wife\u2019s family. My wife denied any\nsuch cases, and even I myself could not remember any. While Dr. P.\nwas taking leave the conversation accidentally turned to excursions,\nand my wife said: \u2018Yes, even to Landgersdorf, where my poor brother\nlies buried, is a long journey.\u2019 This brother died about fifteen years\nago, after having suffered for years from tuberculosis. My wife was\nvery fond of him, and often spoke about him. Indeed, I recall that\nwhen her malady was diagnosed as pleurisy she was very worried and\nsadly remarked: \u2018My brother also died of lung trouble.\u2019 But the memory\nwas so very repressed that even after the above-cited conversation\nabout the trip to L. she found no occasion to correct her information\nconcerning the diseases in her family. I myself was struck by this\nforgetting at the very moment she began to talk about Landgersdorf.\u201d A\nperfectly analogous experience is related by Ernest Jones in his work.\nA physician whose wife suffered from some obscure abdominal malady\nremarked to her: \u201cIt is comforting to think that there has been no\ntuberculosis in your family.\u201d She turned to him very astonished and\nsaid, \u201cHave you forgotten that my mother died of tuberculosis, and that\nmy sister recovered from it only after having been given up by the\ndoctors?\u201d]\n[Footnote 33: During the days when I was first writing these pages\nthe following almost incredible case of forgetting happened to me. On\nthe 1st of January I examined my notes so that I could send out my\nbills. In the month of June I came across the name M----l, and could\nnot recall the person to whom it belonged. My surprise increased when\nI observed from my books that I treated the case in a sanatorium, and\nthat for weeks I had called on the patient daily. A patient treated\nunder such conditions is rarely forgotten by a physician in six\nmonths. I asked myself if it could have been a man--a paretic--a case\nwithout interest? Finally, the note about the fee received brought to\nmy memory all the knowledge which strove to elude it. M----l was a\nfourteen-year-old girl, the most remarkable case of my latter years, a\ncase which taught me a lesson I am not likely ever to forget, a case\nwhose upshot gave me many painful hours. The child became afflicted\nwith an unmistakable hysteria, which quickly and thoroughly improved\nunder my care. After this improvement the child was taken away from\nme by the parents. She still complained of abdominal pains which had\nplayed the part in the hysterical symptoms. Two months later she\ndied of sarcoma of the abdominal glands. The hysteria, to which she\nwas greatly predisposed, took the tumour-formation as a provocative\nagent, and I, fascinated by the tumultuous but harmless manifestations\nof hysteria, perhaps overlooked the first sign of the insidious and\nincurable disease.]\n[Footnote 34: A. Pick (\u201cZur Psychologie des Vergessens bei Geistes- und\nNervenkranken,\u201d _Archiv. f. Kriminal-Anthropologie u. Kriminalistik_,\nvon H. Gross) has recently collected a number of authors who realize\nthe value of the influence of the affective factors on memory, and who\nmore or less clearly recognize that a defensive striving against pain\ncan lead to forgetting. But none of us has been able to represent this\nphenomenon and its psychologic determination as exhaustively, and at\nthe same time as effectively, as Nietzsche in one of his aphorisms\n(_Jenseits von Gut und B\u00f6se_, ii., _Hauptst\u00fcck_ 68): \u201c\u2018I have done\nthat,\u2019 says my Memory. \u2018I could not have done that,\u2019 says my Pride, and\nremains inexorable. Finally, my Memory yields.\u201d]\n[Footnote 35: Cf. Hans Gross, _Kriminal Psychologie_, 1898.]\n[Footnote 36: Darwin on forgetting. In Darwin\u2019s autobiography one finds\nthe following passage that does equal credit to his scientific honesty\nand his psychologic acumen: \u201cI had during many years followed a golden\nrule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or\nthought, came across me which was opposed to my general results, to\nmake a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by\nexperience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape\nfrom the memory than favourable ones\u201d (quoted by Jones, _loc. cit._, p.\n38).]\n[Footnote 37: Cf. Bernheim, _Neue Studien \u00fcber Hypnotismus, Suggestion\nund Psychotherapie_, 1892.]\n[Footnote 38: Young men of education who can pass the examination and\npay for their maintenance serve one instead of two years\u2019 compulsory\nservice.]\n[Footnote 39: In Bernard Shaw\u2019s _C\u00e6sar and Cleopatra_, C\u00e6sar\u2019s\nindifference to Cleopatra is depicted by his being vexed on leaving\nEgypt at having forgotten to do something. He finally recollected what\nhe had forgotten--to take leave of Cleopatra--this, to be sure, is in\nfull accord with historical truth. How little C\u00e6sar thought of the\nlittle Egyptian princess! Cited from Jones, _loc. cit._, p. 50.]\n[Footnote 40: Women, with their fine understanding of unconscious\nmental processes, are, as a rule, more apt to take offence when we do\nnot recognize them in the street, and hence do not greet them, than\nto accept the most obvious explanation, namely, that the dilatory one\nis short-sighted or so engrossed in thought that he did not see them.\nThey conclude that they surely would have been noticed if they had been\nconsidered of any consequence.]\n[Footnote 41: Dr. Ferenczi reports that he was a distracted person\nhimself, and was considered peculiar by his friends on account of\nthe frequency and strangeness of his failing. But the signs of this\ninattention have almost all disappeared since he began to practise\npsychoanalysis with patients, and was forced to turn his attention\nto the analysis of his own ego. He believes that one renounces\nthese failings when one learns to extend by so much one\u2019s own\nresponsibilities. He therefore justly maintains that distractedness\nis a state which depends on unconscious complexes, and is curable by\npsychoanalysis. One day he was reproaching himself for having committed\na technical error in the psychoanalysis of a patient, and on this day\nall his former distractions reappeared. He stumbled while walking in\nthe street (a representation of that _faux pas_ in the treatment), he\nforgot his pocket-book at home, he was a penny short in his car fare,\nhe did not properly button his clothes, etc.]\n[Footnote 42: E. Jones remarks regarding this: \u201cOften the resistance is\nof a general order. Thus a busy man forgets to mail a letter entrusted\nto him--to his slight annoyance--by his wife, just as he may \u2018forget\u2019\nto carry out her shopping orders.\u201d]\n[Footnote 43: For the sake of the unity of the theme I may here digress\nfrom the accepted classification, and add that the human memory evinces\na particular partiality in regard to money matters. False reminiscences\nof having already paid something are often very obstinate, as I know\nfrom personal experience. When free sway is given to avaricious intent\noutside of the serious interests of life, when it is indulged in in\nthe spirit of fun, as in card playing, we then find that the most\nhonourable men show an inclination to errors, mistakes in memory and\naccounts, and without realizing how, they even find themselves involved\nin small frauds. Such liberties depend in no small part also on the\npsychically refreshing character of the play. The saying that in play\nwe can learn a person\u2019s character may be admitted if we can add \u201cthe\nrepressed character.\u201d If waiters ever make unintentional mistakes\nthey are apparently due to the same mechanism. Among merchants we\ncan frequently observe a certain delay in the paying out of sums of\nmoney, in payments of bills and the like, which brings the owner no\nprofit and can be only understood psychologically as the expression\nof a counter-will against giving out money. Brill sums it up with\nepigrammatic keenness: \u201cWe are more apt to mislay letters containing\nbills than cheques\u201d (Brill, _Psychanalysis, its Theories and Practical\nApplication_, p. 197).]\n[Footnote 44: Translated by A. A.

Formerly, it was\na customary sign of mourning, at other times it expressed itself in\nideas of piety and renunciation of the world.]\n[Footnote 51: The case is then identical with a sexual attack on a\nwoman, in whom the attack of the man cannot be warded off through\nthe full muscular strength of the woman because a portion of the\nunconscious feelings of the one attacked meets it with ready\nacceptance. To be sure, it is said that such a situation paralyses the\nstrength of a woman; we need only add the reasons for this paralysis.\nInsofar the clever sentence of Sancho Panza, which he pronounced as\ngovernor of his island, is psychologically unjust (_Don Quixote_,\nvol. ii. chap. xlv). A woman hauled before the judge a man who was\nsupposed to have robbed her of her honour by force of violence. Sancho\nindemnified her with a full purse which he took from the accused, but\nafter the departure of the woman he gave the accused permission to\nfollow her and snatch the purse from her. Both returned wrestling, the\nwoman priding herself that the villain was unable to possess himself of\nthe purse. Thereupon Sancho spoke: \u201cHad you shown yourself so stout and\nvaliant to defend your body (nay, but half so much) as you have done to\ndefend your purse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you.\u201d]\n[Footnote 52: It is evident that the situation of a battlefield is\nsuch as to meet the requirement of conscious suicidal intent which,\nnevertheless, shuns the direct way.

An elderly colleague who\ndoes not like to lose at cards had to pay one evening a large sum of\nmoney in consequence of his losses; he did this without complaint,\nbut with a peculiar constrained temper. After his departure it was\ndiscovered that he had left at this place practically everything he\nhad with him, spectacles, cigar-case, and handkerchief. That would\nbe readily translated into the words: \u201cYou robbers, you have nicely\nplundered me.\u201d A man who suffers from occasional sexual impotence,\nwhich has its origin in the intimacy of his infantile relations to\nhis mother, relates that he is in the habit of embellishing pamphlets\nand notes with an S, the initial of his mother\u2019s name. He cannot\nbear the idea of having letters from home come in contact with other\nunsanctified correspondence, and therefore finds it necessary to keep\nthe former separate. A young woman suddenly flings open the door of the\nconsulting-room while her predecessor is still present. She excused\nherself on the ground of \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d; it soon came to light that\nshe demonstrated her curiosity which caused her at an earlier time to\nintrude into the bedroom of her parents. Girls who are proud of their\nbeautiful hair know so well how to manipulate combs and hairpins, that\nin the midst of conversation their hair becomes loosened. During the\ntreatment (in a reclining position) some men scatter change from their\npockets and thus pay for the hour of treatment; the amount scattered is\nin proportion to their estimation of the work. Whoever forgets articles\nin the doctor\u2019s office, such as eyeglasses, gloves, handbags, generally\nindicates that he cannot tear himself away and is anxious to return\nsoon. Ernest Jones says: \u201cOne can almost measure the success with\nwhich a physician is practising psychotherapy, for instance, by the\nsize of the collection of umbrellas, handkerchiefs, purses, and so on,\nthat he could make in a month. The slightest habits and acts performed\nwith a minimum of attention, such as the winding of a clock before\nretiring to sleep, the putting out of lights before leaving the room,\nand similar actions, are occasionally subject to disturbances which\nclearly demonstrate the influence of the unconscious complex, and what\nis thought to be the strongest \u2018habits.\u2019\u201d\nIn the journal _C\u0153nobium_, Maeder relates about a hospital physician\nwho, on account of an important matter, desired to get to the city\nthat evening, although he was on duty and had no right to leave the\nhospital. On his return he noticed to his surprise that there was a\nlight in his room. On leaving the room he had forgotten to put it out,\nsomething that had never happened before. But he soon grasped the\nmotive of this forgetting. The hospital superintendent who lived in\nthe same house must have concluded from the light in the room that he\nwas at home. A man overburdened with worries and subject to occasional\ndepressions assured me that he regularly forgot to wind his watch\non those evenings when life seemed too hard and unfriendly. In this\nomission to wind his watch he symbolically expressed that it was a\nmatter of indifference to him whether he lived to see the next day.\nAnother man who was personally unknown to me wrote: \u201cHaving been struck\nby a terrible misfortune, life appeared so harsh and unsympathetic,\nthat I imagined that I had not sufficient strength to live to see\nthe next day. I then noticed that almost every day I forgot to wind\nmy watch, something that I never omitted before. I had been in the\nhabit of doing it regularly before retiring in an almost mechanical\nand unconscious manner. It was only very seldom that I thought of\nit, and that happened when I had something important for the next\nday which held my interest. \u2018Should this be considered a symptomatic\naction? I really cannot explain it.\u2019\u201d Whoever will take the trouble,\nlike Jung (_The Psychology of Dementia Pr\u00e6cox_, translated by Peterson\nand Brill), or Maeder (\u201cUne voie nouvelle en Psychologie--Freud et\nson ecole,\u201d _C\u0153nobium_, Lugano, 1906), to pay attention to melodies\nwhich one hums to himself aimlessly and unconsciously, will regularly\ndiscover the relation of the melody\u2019s text to a theme which occupies\nthe person at that time.]\n[Footnote 60: \u201cDas Verlieren als Symptom-handlung,\u201d _Zentralb. f.\nPsychoanalyse_, i. 10-11.]\n[Footnote 61: Translated by A.

Bleuler and Jung have in\nthis way made intelligible the reaction in the so-called association\nexperiments, wherein the test person answers to a given word with one\noccurring to him (stimulus-word reaction), while the time elapsing\nbetween the stimulus word and answer is measured (reaction-time).\nJung has shown in his _Diagnostische Assoziationsstudien_, 1906,\nwhat fine reagents for psychic occurrences we possess in this\nassociation-experiment. Three students of criminology, H. Gross, of\nPrague, and Wertheimer and Klein, have developed from these experiments\na technique for the diagnosis of facts (_Tatbestands-Diagnostik_) in\ncriminal cases, the examination of which is now tested by psychologists\nand jurists.]\n[Footnote 77: Proceeding from other points of view, this interpretation\nof the trivial and accidental by the patient has been designated as\n\u201cdelusions of reference.\u201d]\n[Footnote 78: For example, the fantasies of the hysterical regarding\nsexual and cruel abuse which are made conscious by analysis often\ncorrespond in every detail with the complaints of persecuted\nparanoiacs. It is remarkable but not altogether unexpected that we also\nmeet the identical content as reality in the contrivances of perverts\nfor the gratification of their desires.]\n[Footnote 79: Which naturally has nothing of the character of\nperception.]\n[Footnote 80: _Zentralb. f. Psychoanalyse_, ii. 5.]\n[Footnote 81: Thus far this explanation of _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ has been\nappreciated by only one observer. Dr. Ferenczi, to whom the third\nedition of this book is indebted for so many contributions, writes to\nme concerning this: \u201cI have been convinced, through myself as well as\nothers, that the inexplicable feeling of familiarity can be referred\nto unconscious fantasies of which we are unconsciously reminded in an\nactual situation. With one of my patients the process was apparently\ndifferent, but in reality it was quite analogous. This feeling returned\nto him very often, but showed itself regularly as originating in a\nforgotten (repressed) portion of a dream of the preceding night. Thus\nit appears that the _D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu_ can originate not only from day dreams\nbut also from night dreams.\u201d]\n[Footnote 82: I can perhaps give the following outline concerning the\nmechanism of actual forgetting. The memory material succumbs in general\nto two influences, condensation and disfigurement. Disfigurement is\nthe work of the tendencies dominating the psychic life, and directs\nitself above all against the affective remnants of memory traces which\nmaintain a more resistive attitude towards condensation. The traces\nwhich have grown indifferent merge into a process of condensation\nwithout opposition; in addition it may be observed that tendencies of\ndisfigurement also feed on the indifferent material, because they have\nnot been gratified where they wished to manifest themselves. As these\nprocesses of condensation and disfigurement continue for long periods\nduring which all fresh experiences act upon the transformation of the\nmemory content, it is our belief that it is time that makes memory\nuncertain and indistinct. It is quite probable that in forgetting\nthere can really be no question of a direct function of time. From the\nrepressed memory traces it can be verified that they suffer no changes\neven in the longest periods. The unconscious, at all events, knows no\ntime limit. The most important as well as the most peculiar character\nof psychic fixation consists in the fact that all impressions are on\nthe one hand retained in the same form as they were received, and also\nin the forms that they have assumed in their further development. This\nstate of affairs cannot be elucidated by any comparison from any other\nsphere. By virtue of this theory every former state of the memory\ncontent may thus be restored, even though all original relations have\nlong been replaced by newer ones.]\n[Footnote 83: Cf. here _The Interpretation of Dreams_, p. 483.\nMacmillan: New York; and Allen: London.]\nUNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED, THE GRESHAM PRESS, WOKING AND LONDON\nTranscriber\u2019s Note\nOriginal copyright information has been retained, but this book is in\nthe public domain in the country of publication.\nIn the printed version of this text, footnotes were positioned at the\nbottom of each page.\nIn the printed version, each chapter began with a page containing\nonly its title, followed by a blank page.
