74. Philosophers have been much perplexed in accounting for the origin
   of forms, entelechies, or souls. Today, however, when it has been
   learned through careful investigations made in plant, insect and animal
   life, that the organic bodies of nature are never the product of chaos
   or putrefaction, but always come from seeds in which there was without
   doubt some preformation, it has been decided that not only is the
   organic body already present before conception, but also a soul in this
   body, in a word, the animal itself; and it has been decided that, by
   means of conception the animal is merely made ready for a great
   transformation, so as to become an animal of another sort. We can see
   cases somewhat similar outside of generation when grubs become flies
   and caterpillars butterflies.
