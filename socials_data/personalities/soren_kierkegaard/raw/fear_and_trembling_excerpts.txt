Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It may be excessive to ask of them that they should agree on what doubting is, but at least they might agree that doubt is negative, that it is the difficult task of preserving the mind’s equilibrium, of not letting oneself be deceived by appearances or by the easy answers of the moment.

The Knight of Faith

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment power that twisting in dark passions produced everything that be is great and withal insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond that united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage in the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always looking out for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw--how empty then and comfortless life would be!

But such is not the case.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is clear that this thought cannot be mediated, for all mediation happens precisely by virtue of the universal.

Abraham and Isaac

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac—but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.

Infinite Resignation vs Faith

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

By my own strength I can make the movement of infinite resignation, but by my own strength I cannot get faith, precisely because I have infinite resignation, for faith begins precisely where thought stops.

The absurd is precisely by faith's virtue that the single individual is higher than the universal.
