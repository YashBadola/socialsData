{"text": "1. \"Augustine, in Confessions 1.8.13, writes: 'When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shewn by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires.'\"\nThese words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the essence of human language. It is this: the individual words in language name objects -- sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words \"block\", \"pillar\", \"slab\", \"beam\". A calls them out; -- B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call. -- Conceive this as a complete primitive language.\n3. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises \"Is this an appropriate description or not?\" The answer is: \"Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe.\"\nIt is as if someone were to say: \"A game consists in moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...\" - and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting it to those games.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command? - There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)\nHere the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}
