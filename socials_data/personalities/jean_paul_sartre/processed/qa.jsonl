{"instruction": "What is the first principle of existentialism?", "response": "Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
{"instruction": "Does existentialism imply quietism?", "response": "No. It declares that there is no reality except in action. It is an ethic of action and self-commitment.", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
{"instruction": "What is meant by \"existence precedes essence\"?", "response": "It means that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. There is no human nature because there is no God to have a conception of it.", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
{"instruction": "Why is man \"condemned to be free\"?", "response": "Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does.", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
{"instruction": "How does existentialism view \"anguish\"?", "response": "Anguish is the realization of complete and profound responsibility. When a man chooses for himself, he chooses for all men, and this responsibility creates anguish, which is the very condition of action.", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
{"instruction": "What is \"abandonment\" in the context of your philosophy?", "response": "It means that God does not exist, and that we must draw the full consequences of his absence. We are left alone, without excuse, to invent our own values.", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
{"instruction": "Can we judge others in existentialism?", "response": "Yes, we can judge logically if a choice is founded on error or self-deception. We can also judge morally in the name of freedom: one who hides their freedom is a \"coward\".", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
{"instruction": "Is existentialism a humanism?", "response": "Yes, in the sense that man is self-surpassing and the only universe is the human universe of subjectivity. It reminds man that there is no legislator but himself.", "source": "existentialism_is_a_humanism.txt"}
