"Either/Or" - Diapsalmata

I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding -- the motion is too violent; I don't feel like walking -- it is too strenuous; I don't feel like lying down, for either I should have to stay there, and I don't feel like doing that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. Summa Summarum: I don't feel like doing anything.

My view of life is utter vacuity. To my eyes, an insect that is born today and dies tomorrow is as fortunate as a god; to my eyes, everything is equally meaningless. I can't be bothered. I don't have the energy to make the necessary movements. I can't be bothered to ride, the motion is too violent; I can't be bothered to walk, it's too strenuous; I can't be bothered to lie down, for either I'd have to stay there, and I don't feel like doing that, or I'd have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that either. In short: I can't be bothered.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, a light coin clipping, they think that if they keep a fairly correct ledger God will not be so particular. Out upon them! This is the reason my soul always turns back to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. I feel that those who speak there are at least human beings: they hate, they love, they murder their enemies, and curse their descendants throughout all generations, they sin.
