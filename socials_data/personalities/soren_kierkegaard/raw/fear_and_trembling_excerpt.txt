Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment in the system found any, he seeks in vain. A solitary individual who has not become timely by virtue of the acceleration of time, one whom time has run away from, although he was willing to admit that he had once doubted, might perhaps have the wish to learn what comes after doubt, and how one goes further. But it is lost labor to seek to be informed on this point by our modern philosophy, or to want to know whether the individual in question actually has doubted.

The present writer is in no sense a philosopher. He has not understood the system, whether there is one, whether it is completed; it is already enough for his weak head to ponder what a prodigious head everyone must have nowadays who has such a prodigious thought. Even if one were able to convert the whole content of faith into the form of a concept, it does not follow that one has comprehended faith, comprehended how one entered into it or how it entered into one. The present writer is in no sense a philosopher. He is, poetically and elegantly expressed, a freelance writer who writes because to him it is a luxury that becomes the more agreeable and evident, the fewer there are who buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been obliterated in favor of science, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can be easily leafed through during the afternoon nap, and be sure to look like the polite gardener’s boy in the advertisement, who with hat in hand holds out a glass of rhubarb wine on a tray to the grandmother, who is looking at him with mild surprise. He foresees his fate: to be completely ignored.

Preliminary Expectoration

The story of Abraham is a story of faith. But what is faith? Is it a doctrine? Is it a system? It is a passion.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?
