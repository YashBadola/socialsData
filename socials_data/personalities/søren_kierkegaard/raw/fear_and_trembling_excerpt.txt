What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know, except in so far as a certain knowledge must precede every action. The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do: the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. What good would it do me to discover a so-called objective truth, to work through all the systems of philosophy and be able, if it were required, to review them all and show up the inconsistencies within each of them; - what good would it do me to be able to develop a theory of the state and combine all the details into a single whole, and so construct a world in which I did not live, but only held up to the view of others; - what good would it do me to be able to explain the meaning of Christianity if it had no deeper significance for me and for my life; - what good would it do me if truth stood before me, cold and naked, not caring whether I recognised her or not, and producing in me a shudder of fear rather than a trusting devotion? I certainly do not deny that I still recognise an imperative of understanding and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life, and that is what I now recognise as the most important thing.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is clear that this paradox cannot be mediated; for as soon as the Single Individual and the Universal are brought into mediation, the Single Individual is subordinate to the Universal, and so the paradox is non-existent.

If faith does not make it a holy act to be willing to murder one's son, then let the same judgement be passed upon Abraham as upon every other man. If faith does not make it a holy act to be willing to murder one's son, then Abraham is lost.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith. For only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

The knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right way, this pain he overcomes and is thus not checked by it.
