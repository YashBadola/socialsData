Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and taken for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. This proceeding has all of them to support it and has even made itself plausible to the French. Now a Frenchman has the name of being steady and sedate, but he also has a fire in his belly, and if we are to believe the words of the Frenchman who maintains that he has doubted everything, we must verify the statement by seeing whether his conduct fits his words.

Abraham I

And God tempted Abraham and said unto him, Take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon the mountain which I will show thee.

It was early in the morning, Abraham rose betimes, and had his asses saddled, left his tent, and Isaac with him, but Sarah looked out of the window after them until they had gone down the valley and she could see them no more. They rode in silence for three days. On the morning of the fourth day Abraham said never a word, but he lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off. He left his young men behind and went on alone with Isaac, leading him by the hand. But when Abraham looked up he saw the mountain afar off, and his soul was exceeding sorrowful. And he said to himself: I will not conceal from Isaac whither this journey leads. He stood still, he laid his hand upon Isaac’s head in benediction, and said: “My son, God has required of me a burnt offering; the victim is thyself.” But Isaac answered: “God’s will be done! God who gave me to thee can take me from thee.” Then Abraham’s countenance was changed, his look was paternal, his eye was mild, his speech was admonishing. “My son,” he said, “didst thou think it was God’s requirement? No, it is my desire.”

Preamble from the Heart

Whatever one may have to say about the magnitude of the marvel, the hero is the marvel. The hero is the marvel, and the marvel is the hero. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero, and the marvel is the marvel because it is the marvel. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero. The hero is the marvel because he is the hero.
Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.
