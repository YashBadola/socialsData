{"text": "The way up and the way down are one and the same.\nNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was, is, and will be: an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nThe hidden harmony is better than the obvious.\nNature loves to hide.\nEyes are more accurate witnesses than ears.\nMen who love wisdom should acquaint themselves with a great many particulars.\nAll things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just as goods for gold and gold for goods.\nYou cannot find the boundaries of the soul, even if you travel the whole way; so deep is its meaning.\nA man's character is his fate.\nTime is a game played beautifully by children.\nWe must not act and speak like men asleep.\nDogs bark at what they do not understand.\nThe awakening are shared a world, but the asleep turn aside into private worlds.\nOpposition brings concord. Out of discord comes the fairest harmony.\nCouples are wholes and not wholes, what agrees disagrees, the concordant is discordant. From all things one and from one all things.\nIt is disease that makes health pleasant; evil, good; hunger, satiety; weariness, rest.\nTo God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\nThe sun is new each day.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
