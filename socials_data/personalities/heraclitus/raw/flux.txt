You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.
We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.
It scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.
Even the posset separates if it is not stirred.
It rests by changing. It is a weariness to labour for the same masters and be ruled by them.
We must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away (?) through strife.
War is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.
