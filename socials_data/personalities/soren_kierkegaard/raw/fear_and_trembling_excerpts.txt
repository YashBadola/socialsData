Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-watcher who conscientiously signals the significant trends in the credit market of ideas, every private scholar who is willing to follow the fashion of the day, to say nothing of the standing-room-only students of philosophy who are so ready to sell out for a song—they all agree that the time has come to declare a clearance sale.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.

If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...

But now as to Abraham. How did he act? For I have not forgotten that it is him I have to speak. He did not speak. He spoke to no man. He did not speak to Sarah, nor to Eleazar, nor to Isaac. He passed over the three previous instances, for he knew that from them he could not be understood; for if he had spoken he would have said something else. And therein lies the distress and the anguish. For if I when I speak am unable to make myself understood, then I do not speak even though I talk without stopping day or night. This is the case with Abraham. He is able to utter everything, but one thing he cannot say, and if he were to say it, he would say something else. He is not a tragic hero who can speak, he is a knight of faith who is kept in silence.
