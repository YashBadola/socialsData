1 The world is everything that is the case.
1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.
1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.
1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.
1.2 The world divides into facts.
1.21 Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.
2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).
2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.
2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.
2.02 The object is simple.
2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be analyzed into a statement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes.
2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.
2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.
2.12 The picture is a model of reality.
2.13 To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.
2.14 The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a definite way.
2.141 The picture is a fact.
3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
3.001 "An atomic fact is thinkable"—means: we can imagine it.
3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks. What is thinkable is also possible.
3.03 We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.
4 The thought is the significant proposition.
4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.
4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means—just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.
4.003 Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.
4.0031 All philosophy is "Critique of language" (but not at all in Mauthner's sense). Merit of Russell: to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.
4.11 The totality of true propositions is the total natural science (or the totality of the natural sciences).
4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.
4.112 The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.
5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)
5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
6.4 All propositions are of equal value.
6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value—and if there were, it would be of no value.
6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express something higher.
6.421 It is clear, however, that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics are transcendental. (Ethics and æsthetics are one.)
6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.
7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
