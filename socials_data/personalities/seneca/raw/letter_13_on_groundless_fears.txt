I know that you have plenty of spirit; for even before you began to equip yourself with maxims which were wholesome and potent to overcome obstacles, you were taking pride in your contest with Fortune; and this is all the more true, now that you have grappled with Fortune and tested your powers. For our powers can never inspire in us implicit faith in ourselves except when many difficulties have confronted us on this side and on that, and have occasionally even come to close quarters with us. It is only in this way that the true spirit can be tested,– the spirit that will never consent to come under the jurisdiction of things external to ourselves. This is the touchstone of such a spirit; no prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth rattled beneath his opponent’s fist, who has been tripped and felt the full weight of his adversary who has been disarmed and has never lowered his voice in despair, but has even when overturned cherished the hope that he would rise and go on with the fight.

Therefore, since you have such a man for your helper, why did you let that letter of yours go to my head? I know that you are brave; but even the bravest are sometimes frightened by sudden terrors. It is not the storm that frightens us, but the thunder-clap; it is not the wound that we fear, but the sight of the weapon. And so I say to you, Lucilius: there are more things to alarm us than to harm us, and we suffer more often in apprehension than in reality.

I am not speaking with you in the Stoic strain but in my own. For it is our Stoic fashion to speak of all those things, which provoke cries and groans, as unimportant and beneath notice; but you and I must drop such great-sounding words, although, heaven knows, they are true enough. What I advise you to do is, not to be unhappy before the crisis comes; since it may be that the dangers before which you paled as if they were threatening you, will never come upon you; they certainly have not yet come. Accordingly, some things torment us more than they ought; some torment us before they ought; and some torment us when they ought not to torment us at all. We are in the habit of exaggerating, or imagining, or anticipating, sorrow.

Let us look at the beginning of your letter; for that is the text of my sermon. You say that your "words faltered" and your "hand shook" when you wrote to me concerning the lawsuit which an enemy was bringing against you. And yet, this is only a lawsuit, not a death-blow! And you a man! Be ashamed of yourself! If I know you, you will have to prove that the case is not against you, but against your adversary. I mean that the case is a trivial one, but the adversary is a nuisance. And in this matter, you must look out for one thing,– that you do not take for granted that what is possible is also certain. For generally, the worst does not happen; or at any rate, you can put up with it if it does.

But I am ashamed to say this to a Stoic! For it is the part of a Stoic to meet adversity with a spirit that is ready for it. But you – you are afraid of a lawsuit! And what is a lawsuit? It is a dispute about money, or about property, or about rights. And what is money? What is property? What are rights? They are things indifferent! And since they are things indifferent, they are not evils. And if they are not evils, why do you fear them?

It is groundless fear that makes men wretched.
